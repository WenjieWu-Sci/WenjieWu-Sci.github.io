  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

However, the current Rayleigh scattering length calculation for LAB disagrees with the experimental measurement. This paper reports for the first time that the Rayleigh scattering of LAB is anisotropic, with a depolarization ratio of 0.31±0.01(stat.)±0.01(sys.). We use an indirect method for Rayleigh scattering measurement with the Einstein–Smoluchowski–Cabannes formula, and the Rayleigh scattering length of LAB is determined to be 28.2±1.0 m at 430 nm.},

The installation of a flash analog-to-digital converter readout system and a special calibration campaign using different source enclosures reduce uncertainties in the absolute energy calibration to less than 0.5\% for visible energies larger than 2 MeV. The uncertainty in the cosmogenic 9Li and 8He background is reduced from 45\% to 30\% in the near detectors. A detailed investigation of the spent nuclear fuel history improves its uncertainty from 100\% to 30\%. Analysis of the relative ¯νe rates and energy spectra among detectors yields sin22θ13=0.0856±0.0029 and Δm232=(2.471+0.068−0.070)×10−3 eV2 assuming the normal hierarchy, and Δm232=−(2.575+0.068−0.070)×10−3 eV2 assuming the inverted hierarchy.},

  abstract = {Liquid scintillators are commonly used to detect low energy neutrinos from the reactors, sun, and earth. It is a challenge to reconstruct deposited energies for a large liquid scintillator detector. For detectors with multiple optical mediums such as JUNO and SNO+, the prediction of the propagation of detected photons is extremely difficult due to mixed optical processes such as Rayleigh scattering, refraction and total reflection at their boundaries. Calibration based reconstruction methods consume impractical time since a large number of calibration points are required in a giant detector. In this paper, we propose a new model-independent method to reconstruct deposited energies with minimum requirements on the calibration system. This method is validated with JUNO's offline software. Monte Carlo studies show that the energy non-uniformity can be controlled below 1\%, which is crucial for JUNO to achieve 3\% energy resolution.},

The double-differential cross section in final-state electron energy and angle is presented for the first time, together with the single-differential dependence on Q2 (squared four-momentum transfer) and energy, in the range 1 GeV≤Eν{\textless}6 GeV. Detailed comparisons are made to the predictions of the GENIE, GiBUU, NEUT, and NuWro neutrino event generators.
