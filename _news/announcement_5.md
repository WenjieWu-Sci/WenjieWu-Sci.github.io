The Daya Bay and RENO collaborations are awarded the 2023 **EPS High Energy and Particle Physics Prize** for 
> the observation of short-baseline reactor electron-antineutrino disappearance,, providing the first determination of the neutrino mixing angle $$\theta_{13}$$, which paves the way for the detection of CP violation in the lepton sector. 

A week before, Daya Bay published the final measurement of $$\theta_{13}$$ and $$|\Delta m^2_{32}|$$ in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.161802">PRL</a> with all nGd data taken in 3158 days.
