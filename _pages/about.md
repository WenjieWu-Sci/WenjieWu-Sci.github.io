My main research interest is everything about neutrino physics, includes both hardware and software aspects, as well as data analysis of neutrino experiments. Current interests are as follows:

- Neutrino oscillation is currently the only experimental phenomenon observed beyond the standard model. I've been working on multiple neutrino experiments aiming for precisely measuring oscillation parameters. They'll deepen our understanding to the universe we're living in but not familiar with.
- The mystery of neutrino arises from its nature of interacting with materials by only weak force, which makes the detection of neutrinos extremely challenging. Various detection techniques have been explored and realized in different experiments. I have been working on liquid scintillator detectors (Daya Bay, JUNO, and NOvA), and liquid argon time projection chamber detectors (DUNE). 
- Machine learning techniques have been rapidly developed benefiting from the explosive increase of data. They have been applied to particle physics experiments and realized very good performance. I've been working on the deep-learning-based kinematic reconstruction for DUNE and CNN-based event classifiers for NOvA.
