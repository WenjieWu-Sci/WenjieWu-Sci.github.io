My main research interest is everything about neutrino physics, includes both hardware and software aspects, as well as data analysis of neutrino experiments. Current interests are as follows:
* The mystery of neutrino arises from its nature of interacting with materials by only weak force, which makes the detection of neutrinos extremely challenging. Various detection techniques have been explored and realized in different experiments. I have been working on liquid scintillator detectors (Daya Bay, JUNO, and NOvA), and liquid argon time projection chamber detectors (DUNE). Both techniques have its own pros and cons, and we have to do research to understand what suits better for the physics goals. 
* Along with the growing volume of data and complexity of algorithms, greater computing capability becomes necessary to simulations, reconstructions, data analyses which cover basically every aspects in an experiment. I worked on the vertex reconstruction algorithm of JUNO and greatly improved its efficiency by reconfiguring it on GPUs. I believe the great computing capability and scalable architecture of GPU make it useful for many problems.
* Computer science ran into the similar situation in the last decade, and the machine learning technique has a rapid development benefiting from the explosive increase of data. This technique is a typical application of GPU and has been applied to particle physics experiments. I've been working on the deep-learning-based kinematic reconstruction for DUNE and CNN-based event classifiers for NOvA. Both studies show considerable improvements comparing to the traditional methods.
