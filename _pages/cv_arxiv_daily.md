2024-04-16, **In-depth analysis of solar models with high-metallicity abundances and updated opacity tables**, G. Buldgen et.al., [2404.10478v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10478v1)

 Due to the high quality constraints available for the Sun, we can carry out combined analyses using neutrino, spectroscopic and helioseismic observations. Such studies lay the ground for future improvements of key physical components of solar and stellar models, such as the equation of state, radiative opacities or prescriptions for macroscopic transport processes of chemicals which are then used to study other stars in the Universe. We study the existing degeneracies in solar models using the recent high-metallicity spectroscopic abundances by comparing them to helioseismic and neutrino data and discuss how their properties are impacted by changes in various physical ingredients. We carry out a detailed study of solar models computed with a high-metallicity composition from the literature based on averaged-3D models that was claimed to solve the solar problem. The properties of the solar models are significantly affected by using the recent OPLIB opacities and the inclusion of macroscopic transport. The properties of the standard solar models computed using the OPAL opacities are similar to those using the OP opacities. We show that a modifying the temperature gradient just below the base of the convective zone is required to erase the discrepancies in solar models, particularly in the presence of macroscopic mixing. This can be simulated by a local increase of opacity of a few percent. We conclude that the existing degeneracies and issues in solar modelling are not erased by an increase in the solar metallicity in contradiction to was suggested in recent papers. Therefore, standard solar models cannot be used as an argument for a high metallicity composition. While further work is required to improve solar models, we note that direct helioseismic inversions indicate a low metallicity in the convective envelope, in agreement with spectroscopic analyses based on full 3D models.

2024-04-16, **A newly developed multi-kilo-channel high-speed and precision waveform digitization system for neutrino experiments**, H. Yang et.al., [2404.10373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10373v1)

 The Jinping Neutrino Experiment(JNE), conducted within the China Jinping Underground Laboratory, aims to detect and analyze of solar neutrinos, geo-neutrinos, and supernova neutrinos. A one-ton prototype will soon be in commision with an upgrade from 30 channels to 60 channels, which will increase the data bandwidth by one to two orders of magnitude and exceed the capacity of the current CAEN DAQ system. Additionally, enhancing the performance and flexibility of JNE DAQ system is crucial. This paper presents the design of a new Tsinghua DAQ system for the JNE and its performance and stability. The new Tsinghua DAQ(THDAQ) system for JNE is based on the cPCI protocol and demonstrates powerful performance improvements: ADC ENOB of the THDAQ system approximately exceeds 9.8-bit, marking a 14% improvement over the CAEN DAQ system; The maximum clock deviation within a single chassis is 85.6 ps, satisfying sub-nanosecond synchronization criteria; Each DAQ board features two QSFP+ optical ports with 82.5Gbps transmission capability, while the PCIe board supports a transmission rate of 100.2 Gbps. In addition, comparative experiments between the two systems were also tested in detail. The analysis results of waveform and charge spectrum prove the high stability of the THDAQ system. This provides a foundation for the 60-channel and 4000-channel DAQ systems.

2024-04-15, **The $N_{\rm eff}$ at CMB challenges $U(1)_X$ light gauge boson scenarios**, Dilip Kumar Ghosh et.al., [2404.10077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10077v1)

 The relativistic degrees of freedom ($N\_{\rm eff}$) is one of the crucial cosmological parameters. The precise measurement of $N\_{\rm eff}$ at the time of cosmic microwave background formation, by Planck 2018 can be used to understand the new fundamental interactions, in particular involving light mediators. Presence of any new particle with sufficient energy density and sizeable interactions with Standard Model particles at the temperature around $\sim$ MeV can significantly alter the neutrino decoupling and hence $N\_{\rm eff}$. Thus the bound on $N\_{\rm eff}$ can place stringent constraints on various beyond Standard Model paradigms involving light particles. $U(1)\_X$ models are among such scenarios and are widely studied in several aspects. In this work, we consider several popular $U(1)\_X$ models with light $Z'$ boson like $U(1)\_{B-L}$, $U(1)\_{B - 3L\_i}$, $U(1)\_{B\_i - 3 L\_j}$, $U(1)\_{L\_i - L\_j}$; $i,j =1,2,3$ being the flavour indices and study their impact on $N\_{\rm eff}$. We also examine the constraints from ground based experiments like Xenon1T, Borexino, trident, etc. Our analysis shows that for light mass $M\_{Z'} \lesssim \mathcal{O} (\rm{MeV})$ the $N\_{\rm eff}$ provides the most stringent constraints on the $Z'$ mass and coupling, far exceeding the existing constraints from other experiments.

2024-04-15, **SMEFT predictions for semileptonic processes**, Siddhartha Karmakar et.al., [2404.10061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10061v1)

 The $SU(2)\_L\times U(1)\_Y$ invariance of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) predicts multiple restrictions in the space of Wilson coefficients of $U(1)\_{em}$ invariant effective lagrangians such as the Low-energy Effective Field Theory (LEFT), used for low-energy flavor-physics observables, or the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) in unitary gauge, appropriate for weak-scale observables. In this work, we derive and list all such predictions for semileptonic operators up to dimension 6. We find that these predictions can be expressed as 2223 linear relations among the HEFT/LEFT Wilson coefficients, that are completely independent of any assumptions about the alignment of the mass and flavor bases. These relations connect diverse experimental searches such as rare meson decays, high-$p\_T$ dilepton searches, top decays, $Z$-pole observables, charged lepton flavor violating observables and non-standard neutrino interaction searches. We demonstrate how these relations can be used to derive strong indirect constraints on multiple Wilson coefficients that are currently either weakly constrained from direct experiments or have no direct bound at all. These relations also imply, in general, that evidence for new physics in a particular search channel must be accompanied by correlated anomalies in other channels.

2024-04-15, **Neutrino and Gamma-Ray Signatures of Inelastic Dark Matter Annihilating outside Neutron Stars**, Javier F. Acevedo et.al., [2404.10039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10039v1)

 We present a new inelastic dark matter search: neutron stars in dark matter-rich environments capture inelastic dark matter which, for interstate mass splittings between about $45 - 285 \ \rm MeV$, will annihilate away before becoming fully trapped inside the object. This means a sizable fraction of the dark matter particles can annihilate while being outside the neutron star, producing neutron star-focused gamma-rays and neutrinos. We analyze this effect for the first time and target the neutron star population in the Galactic Center, where the large dark matter and neutron star content makes this signal most significant. Depending on the assumed neutron star and dark matter distributions, we set constraints on the dark matter-nucleon inelastic cross-section using existing H.E.S.S. observations. We also forecast the sensitivity of upcoming gamma-ray and neutrino telescopes to this signal, which can reach inelastic cross-sections as low as $\sim 2 \times 10^{-47} \ \rm cm^2$.

2024-04-15, **Measurement of the differential cross section for neutral pion production in charged-current muon neutrino interactions on argon with the MicroBooNE detector**, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., [2404.09949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09949v1)

 We present a measurement of neutral pion production in charged-current interactions using data recorded with the MicroBooNE detector exposed to Fermilab's booster neutrino beam. The signal comprises one muon, one neutral pion, any number of nucleons, and no charged pions. Studying neutral pion production in the MicroBooNE detector provides an opportunity to better understand neutrino-argon interactions, and is crucial for future accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments. Using a dataset corresponding to $6.86 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target, we present single-differential cross sections in muon and neutral pion momenta, scattering angles with respect to the beam for the outgoing muon and neutral pion, as well as the opening angle between the muon and neutral pion. Data extracted cross sections are compared to generator predictions. We report good agreement between the data and the models for scattering angles, except for an over-prediction by generators at muon forward angles. Similarly, the agreement between data and the models as a function of momentum is good, except for an underprediction by generators in the medium momentum ranges, $200-400$ MeV for muons and $100-200$ MeV for pions.

2024-04-15, **Combined Pre-Supernova Alert System with Kamland and Super-Kamiokande**, KamLAND et.al., [2404.09920v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09920v2)

 Preceding a core-collapse supernova, various processes produce an increasing amount of neutrinos of all flavors characterized by mounting energies from the interior of massive stars. Among them, the electron antineutrinos are potentially detectable by terrestrial neutrino experiments such as KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande via inverse beta decay interactions. Once these pre-supernova neutrinos are observed, an early warning of the upcoming core-collapse supernova can be provided. In light of this, KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande have been monitoring pre-supernova neutrinos since 2015 and 2021, respectively. Recently, we performed a joint study between KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande on pre-supernova neutrino detection. A pre-supernova alert system combining the KamLAND detector and the Super-Kamiokande detector is developed and put into operation, which can provide a supernova alert to the astrophysics community. Fully leveraging the complementary properties of these two detectors, the combined alert is expected to resolve a pre-supernova neutrino signal from a 15 M$\_{\odot}$ star within 510 pc of the Earth, at a significance level corresponding to a false alarm rate of no more than 1 per century. For a Betelgeuse-like model with optimistic parameters, it can provide early warnings up to 12 hours in advance.

2024-04-15, **Neutrino dipole portal at a high energy $μ-$collider**, Daniele Barducci et.al., [2404.09609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09609v1)

 We study the phenomenology of $d=6$ dipole portal operators connecting active and sterile neutrinos at a futuristic muon collider. These operators can be the dominant portal between the Standard Model and the New Physics sector in scenarios in which the active-sterile mixing is suppressed. We identify two production modes for sterile neutrinos: one proceeding through the exchange of an $s-$channel electroweak boson and one arising from the fusion of an electroweak boson with a Standard Model lepton. We study the expected reach on the operators suppression scale for these different production mechanisms, showing that the latter offers the best sensitivity and allowing to test a New Physics scale in the $\sim 10\;$TeV range.

2024-04-15, **Deep Learning for Cosmological Parameter Inference from Dark Matter Halo Density Field**, Zhiwei Min et.al., [2404.09483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09483v1)

 We propose a lightweight deep convolutional neural network (lCNN) to estimate cosmological parameters from simulated three-dimensional DM halo distributions and associated statistics. The training dataset comprises 2000 realizations of a cubic box with a side length of 1000 $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, and interpolated over a cubic grid of $300^3$ voxels, with each simulation produced using $512^3$ DM particles and $512^3$ neutrinos . Under the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, simulations vary standard six cosmological parameters including $\Omega\_m$, $\Omega\_b$, $h$, $n\_s$, $\sigma\_8$, $w$, along with the neutrino mass sum, $M\_\nu$. We find that: 1) within the framework of lCNN, extracting large-scale structure information is more efficient from the halo density field compared to relying on the statistical quantities including the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, and the coefficients from wavelet scattering transform; 2) combining the halo density field with its Fourier transformed counterpart enhances predictions, while augmenting the training dataset with measured statistics further improves performance; 3) achieving high accuracy in inferring $\Omega\_m$, $h$, $n\_s$, and $\sigma\_8$ by the neural network model, while being inefficient in predicting $\Omega\_b$,$M\_\nu$ and $w$; 4) compared to the simple random forest network trained with three statistical quantities, lCNN yields unbiased estimations with reduced statistical errors: approximately 33.3\% for $\Omega\_m$, 20.0\% for $h$, 8.3\% for $n\_s$, and 40.0\% for $\sigma\_8$. Our study emphasizes this lCNN-based novel approach in extracting large-scale structure information and estimating cosmological parameters.

2024-04-16, **Scalar field dark matter with time-varying equation of state**, Gaspard Poulot et.al., [2404.10524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10524v1)

 We propose a new model of scalar field dark matter interacting with dark energy. Adopting a fluid description of the dark matter field in the regime of rapid oscillations, we find that the equation of state for dark matter is non-zero and even becomes increasingly negative at late times during dark energy domination. Furthermore, the speed of sound of dark matter is non-vanishing at all length scales, and a non-adiabatic pressure contribution arises. The results indicate that there are still unexplored possible interactions within the dark sector that lead to novel background effects and can impact structure formation processes.

2024-04-16, **Observation of thermal microwave photons with a Josephson junction detector**, A. L. Pankratov et.al., [2404.10434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10434v1)

 When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.

2024-04-16, **The evolutionary pathways of disk galaxies with different sizes**, Hong-Chuan Ma et.al., [2404.10432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10432v1)

 From the IllustrisTNG-50 simulation, a sample of 836 central disk galaxies with tiny stellar halos is chosen to study the inherent evolution of galaxies driven by nature. These galaxies are classified as compact, normal, or extended by referencing their locations on the mass-size ($M\_\star-R\_{\rm 1/2}$) diagram. This research demonstrates the distinctive evolutionary pathways of galaxies with different sizes in IllustrisTNG simulations, primarily driven by nature. It is confirmed that disk galaxies inherit the angular momentum of their parent dark matter halos. More compact galaxies form earlier within halos possessing lower specific angular momentum through heightened star formation during the early phase at redshifts above 2. During the later phase, the size of extended galaxies experiences more pronounced growth by accreting gas with high angular momentum. Additionally, we reveal that many key characteristics of galaxies are linked to their mass and size: (1) compact galaxies tend to exhibit higher metal content, proportional to the potential well $\frac{M\_\star}{R\_{\rm 1/2}}$, (2) compact galaxies host more massive bulges and black holes, and higher central concentration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that galaxies of all types continue to actively engage in star formation, with no evident signs of quenching attributed to their varying sizes and angular momenta.

2024-04-16, **Axion star condensation around primordial black holes and microlensing limits**, Ziwen Yin et.al., [2404.10340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10340v1)

 We present novel findings concerning the parameter space of axion stars, extended object forming in dense dark matter environments through gravitational condensation. We emphasize their formation within the dense minihalos that potentially surround primordial black holes and in axion miniclusters. Our study investigates the relation between the radius and mass of an axion star in these dense surroundings, revealing distinct morphological characteristics compared to isolated scenarios. We explore the implications of these results when applied to gravitational microlensing from extended objects and gravitational wave detection from compact binaries, leading to insights on the observational constraints from such ``halo'' axion stars. We provide a constraint on the fraction of the galactic population of axion stars from their contribution to the microlensing events from the EROS-2 survey, using the numerical resolution of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation.

2024-04-16, **Majoron-Driven Leptogenesis in Gauged $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ Model**, Juntaro Wada et.al., [2404.10283v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10283v1)

 We propose a novel leptogenesis scenario in the gauged $U(1)\_{L\_{\mu}-L\_{\tau}}$ model. Achieving successful leptogenesis in the $U(1)\_{L\_{\mu}-L\_{\tau}}$ symmetric phase is challenging due to the absence of a CP phase, caused by restriction from the gauge symmetry. To overcome this issue, we introduce an additional global symmetry, $U(1)\_{B-L}$, and a scalar field $\Phi$ responsible for breaking this symmetry. Through the kinetic misalignment mechanism, the majoron field associated with $U(1)\_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking has a kinetic motion in the early universe. Subsequently, time-dependent majoron field background induces the background CP phase dynamically, leading to successful leptogenesis in the $U(1)\_{L\_{\mu}-L\_{\tau}}$ symmetric phase. Furthermore, majoron itself serves as a dark matter candidate in this scenario. As one of the phenomenological applications, we consider the model that can also explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly.

2024-04-16, **Calibration of the Cryogenic Measurement System of a Resonant Haloscope Cavity**, Dong He et.al., [2404.10264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10264v1)

 Possible light bosonic dark matter interactions with the Standard Model photon have been searched by microwave resonant cavities. In this paper, we demonstrate the cryogenic readout system calibration of a 7.138 GHz copper cavity with a loaded quality factor $Q\_l=10^4$, operated at 22 mK temperature based on a dilution refrigerator. Our readout system consists of High Electron Mobility Transistors as cryogenic amplifiers at 4 K, plus room-temperature amplifiers and a spectrum analyzer for signal power detection. We test the system with a superconducting two-level system as a single-photon source in the microwave frequency regime and report an overall 95.6 dB system gain and -71.4 dB attenuation in the cavity's input channel. The effective noise temperature of the measurement system is 7.5 K.

2024-04-16, **Dark photon - dark energy stationary axisymmetric black holes**, Marek Rogatko et.al., [2404.10236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10236v1)

 Using Ernst formalism, stationary axisymmetric black hole solution in Einstein-dark matter-dark energy gravity has been elaborated. The dark sector was chosen as dark photon concept, where an auxiliary U(1)-gauge field coupled to ordinary Maxwell one was introduced, while dark energy was modelled by the existence of positive cosmological constant. Refining our studies to the case of vanishing cosmological constant, the uniqueness theorem for the black hole in question has been proved.

2024-04-15, **Non-Monotonic Relations of Galaxy Star Formation, Radius, and Structure at Fixed Stellar Mass**, Jimena Stephenson et.al., [2404.10114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10114v1)

 We investigate the relation between galaxy structure and star formation rate (SFR) in a sample of $\sim2.9\times10^{4}$ central galaxies with $z<0.0674$ and axial ratios $b/a>0.5$. The star-forming main sequence (SFMS) shows a bend around the stellar mass of $M\_\ast\leq{}M\_c=2\times10^{10}{}M\_{\odot}$. At $M\_\ast\leq{}M\_c$ the SFMS follows a power-law $\text{SFR}\propto{}M\_\ast^{0.85}$, while at higher masses it flattens. $M\_c$ corresponds to a dark matter halo mass of $M\_\text{vir}\sim{}10^{11.8}M\_{\odot}$ where virial shocks occurs. Some galaxy structure (e.g., half-light radius, $R\_e$) exhibits a non-monotonic dependence across the SFMS at a fixed $M\_\ast$. We find $\text{SFR}\propto{R\_e^{-0.28}}$ at fixed $M\_\ast$, consistent with the global Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law. This finding suggests that galaxy sizes contribute to the scatter of the SFMS. However, at $M\_\ast>M\_c$ the relationship between SFR and $R\_e$ diminishes. Low-mass galaxies above the mean of the SFMS have smaller radii, exhibit compact and centrally concentrated profiles resembling green valley (GV) and quiescent galaxies at the same mass, and have higher $M\_{\text{H}\_2}/M\_\text{HI}$. Conversely, those below the SFMS exhibit larger radii, lower densities, have no GV or quiescent counterparts at their mass and have lower $M\_{\text{H}\_2}/M\_\text{HI}$. The above data suggest two pathways for quenching low-mass galaxies, $M\_\ast\leq{}M\_c$: a fast one that changes the morphology on the SFMS and a slow one that does not. Above $M\_c$, galaxies below the SFMS resemble GV and quiescent galaxies structurally, implying that they undergo a structural transformation already within the SFMS. For these massive galaxies, CG are strongly bimodal, with SFMS galaxies exhibiting negative color gradients, suggesting most star formation occurs in their outskirts, maintaining them within the SFMS.

2024-04-15, **Solar reflection of dark matter with dark-photon mediators**, Timon Emken et.al., [2404.10066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10066v1)

 We consider the scattering of low-mass halo dark-matter particles in the hot plasma of the Sun, focusing on dark matter that interact with ordinary matter through a dark-photon mediator. The resulting ``solar-reflected'' dark matter (SRDM) component contains high-velocity particles, which significantly extend the sensitivity of terrestrial direct-detection experiments to sub-MeV dark-matter masses. We use a detailed Monte-Carlo simulation to model the propagation and scattering of dark-matter particles in the Sun, including thermal effects, with special emphasis on ultralight dark-photon mediators. We study the properties of the SRDM flux, obtain exclusion limits from various direct-detection experiments, and provide projections for future experiments, focusing especially on those with silicon and xenon targets. We find that proposed future experiments with xenon and silicon targets can probe the entire ``freeze-in benchmark,'' in which dark matter is coupled to an ultralight dark photon, including dark-matter masses as low as $\mathcal{O}$(keV). Our simulations and SRDM fluxes are publicly available.

 We present the first results of the search for sub-MeV fermionic dark matter absorbed by electron targets of Germanium using the 205.4~kg$\cdot$day data collected by the CDEX-10 experiment, with the analysis threshold of 160~eVee. No significant dark matter (DM) signals over the background are observed. Results are presented as limits on the cross section of DM--electron interaction. We present new constraints of cross section in the DM range of 0.1--10 keV/$c^2$ for vector and axial-vector interaction. The upper limit on the cross section is set to be $\rm 5.5\times10^{-46}~cm^2$ for vector interaction, and $\rm 1.8\times10^{-46}~cm^2$ for axial-vector interaction at DM mass of 5 keV/$c^2$.

2024-04-15, **Using Micromegas detectors for direct dark matter searches: challenges and perspectives**, K. Altenmueller et.al., [2404.09727v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09727v1)

 Gas time projection chambers (TPCs) with Micromegas pixelated readouts are being used in dark matter searches and other rare event searches, due to their potential in terms of low background levels, energy and spatial resolution, gain, and operational stability. Moreover, these detectors can provide precious features,such as topological information, allowing for event directionality and powerful signal-background discrimination. The Micromegas technology of the microbulk type is particularly suited to low-background applications and is being exploited by detectors for CAST and IAXO (solar axions) and TREX-DM (low-mass WIMPs) experiments. Challenges for the future include reducing intrinsic background levels, reaching lower energy detection levels, and technical issues such as robustness of detector, new design choices, novel gas mixtures and operation points, scaling up to larger detector sizes, handling large readout granularity, etc. We report on the status and prospects of the development ongoing in the context of IAXO and TREX-DM experiments, pointing to promising perspectives for the use of Micromegas detectors in directdark matter searches

2024-04-15, **Astrochemistry of the molecular gas in Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies at the Cosmic Noon**, Francesca Perrotta et.al., [2404.09673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09673v1)

 FIR and submm observations have established the fundamental role of dust-obscured star formation in the assembly of stellar mass over the past 12 billion years. At z between 2 and 4, the bulk of star formation is enshrouded in dust, and dusty star forming galaxies (DSFGs) contain about half of the total stellar mass density. Star formation develops in dense molecular clouds, and is regulated by a complex interplay between all the ISM components that contribute to the energy budget of a galaxy: gas, dust, cosmic rays, interstellar electromagnetic fields, gravitational field, dark matter. Molecular gas is the actual link between star forming gas and its complex environment, providing by far the richest amount of information about the star formation process. However, molecular lines interpretation requires complex modeling of astrochemical networks, which regulate the molecular formation and establishes molecular abundances in a cloud, and a modeling of the physical conditions of the gas in which molecular energy levels become populated. This paper critically reviews the main astrochemical parameters needed to get predictions about molecular signals in DSFGs. We review the current knowledge and the open questions about the interstellar medium of DSFGs, outlying the key role of molecular gas as a tracer and shaper of the star formation process.

2024-04-15, **Millimeter-wave CO and SiO Observations toward the Broad-velocity-width Molecular Feature CO 16.134-0.553: a Smith cloud scenario?**, Hiroki Yokozuka et.al., [2404.09670v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09670v1)

 We report the results of the CO $\textit J$=1-0 and SiO $\textit J$=2-1 mapping observations towards the broad-velocity-width molecular feature CO 16.134-0.553 with the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m telescope. The high quality CO map shows that the 5-pc size broad-velocity-width feature bridges two separate velocity components at $\textit V\_{\rm{LSR}}$$\quad$$\simeq$ 40 km s$^{-1}$ and 65 km s$^{-1}$ in the position-velocity space. The kinetic power of CO 16.134-0.553 amounts to $7.8\times10^2$ $\textit L$$\_\odot$ whereas no apparent driving sources were identified. Prominent SiO emission was detected from the broad-velocity-width feature and its root in the $\textit V\_{\rm{LSR}}$$\quad$$\simeq$ 40 km s$^{-1}$ component. In the CO Galactic plane survey data, CO 16.134-0.553 appears to correspond to the Galactic eastern rim of a 15-pc diameter expanding CO shell. An $1\deg$-diameter H I emission void and $4\deg$-long vertical H I filament were also found above and below the CO shell, respectively. We propose that the high-velocity plunge of a dark matter subhalo with a clump of baryonic matter was responsible for the formation of the H I void, CO 16.134-0.553/CO shell, and the H I filament.

2024-04-16, **H-alpha emission and HII regions at the locations of recent supernovae in nearby galaxies**, Ness Mayker Chen et.al., [2404.10762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10762v1)

 We present a statistical analysis of the local, approximately 50-100 pc scale, H-alpha emission at the locations of recent (less than 125 years) supernovae (SNe) in nearby star-forming galaxies. Our sample consists of 32 SNe in 10 galaxies that are targets of the PHANGS-MUSE survey. We find that 41% (13/32) of these SNe occur coincident with a previously identified HII region. For comparison, HII regions cover 32% of the area within 1 kpc of any recent SN. Contrasting this local covering fraction with the fraction of SNe coincident with HII regions, we find a statistical excess of 7.6% +/- 8.7% of all SNe to be associated with HII regions. This increases to an excess of 19.2% +/- 10.4% when considering only core-collapse SNe. These estimates appear to be in good agreement with qualitative results from new, higher resolution HST H-alpha imaging, which also suggest many CCSNe detonate near but not in HII regions. Our results appear consistent with the expectation that only a modest fraction of stars explode during the first 5 Myr of the life of a stellar population, when H-alpha emission is expected to be bright. Of the HII region associated SNe, 8% (11/13) also have associated detected CO(2-1) emission, indicating the presence of molecular gas. The HII region associated SNe have typical Av extinctions approximately equal to 1 mag, consistent with a significant amount of pre-clearing of gas from the region before the SNe explode.

 We present an analysis of rest-frame UV continuum slopes, $\beta$, using a sample of 1011 galaxies at $6.5<z<13$ from the EPOCHS photometric sample collated from the GTO PEARLS and public ERS/GTO/GO (JADES, CEERS, NGDEEP, GLASS) JWST NIRCam imaging across $178.9~\mathrm{arcmin}^2$ of unmasked blank sky. We correct our UV slopes for the photometric error coupling bias using $200,000$ power law SEDs for each $\beta=\{-1,-1.5,-2,-2.5,-3\}$ in each field, finding biases as large as $\Delta\beta\simeq-0.55$ for the lowest SNR galaxies in our sample. Additionally, we simulate the impact of rest-UV line emission (including Ly$\alpha$) and damped Ly$\alpha$ systems on our measured $\beta$, finding biases as large as $0.5-0.6$ for the most extreme systems. We find a decreasing trend with redshift of $\beta=-1.51\pm0.08-(0.097\pm0.010)\times z$, with potential evidence for Pop.~III stars or top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs) in a subsample of 68 $\beta+\sigma\_{\beta}<-2.8$ galaxies. At $z\simeq11.5$, we measure an extremely blue $\beta(M\_{\mathrm{UV}}=-19)=-2.73\pm0.06$, deviating from simulations, indicative of low-metallicity galaxies with non-zero Lyman continuum escape fractions $f\_{\mathrm{esc, LyC}}\gtrsim0$ and minimal dust content. The observed steepening of $\mathrm{d}\beta/\mathrm{d}\log\_{10}(M\_{\star}/\mathrm{M}\_{\odot})$ from $0.22\pm0.02$ at $z=7$ to $0.81\pm0.13$ at $z=11.5$ implies that dust produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) at early times may be ejected via outflows from low mass galaxies. We also observe a flatter $\mathrm{d}\beta/\mathrm{d}M\_{\mathrm{UV}}=0.03\pm0.02$ at $z=7$ and a shallower $\mathrm{d}\beta/\mathrm{d}\log\_{10}(M\_{\star} / \mathrm{M}\_{\odot})$ at $z<11$ than seen by HST, unveiling a new population of low mass, faint, galaxies reddened by dust produced in the stellar winds of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet binaries.

2024-04-16, **Formation of GW230529 from Isolated Binary Evolution and Its Electromagnetic Counterparts**, Jin-Ping Zhu et.al., [2404.10596v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10596v1)

 In this {\em Letter}, we explore the formation of the mass-gap black hole-neutron star (mgBHNS) merger detected in gravitational wave (GW) event, i.e., GW230529, from the isolated binary evolution channel, and study potential signatures of its electromagnetic signals. By adopting the `delayed' supernova prescription and reasonable model realizations, our population synthesis simulation results can simultaneously match the inferred event rate densities of GW230529-like mgBHNS and total BHNS mergers, as well as the population distribution of the BH mass in BHNS mergers reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Thus, we conclude that the recently-discovered mgBHNS merger, GW230529, can be explained through the isolated binary evolution channel. Considering the equation of states of AP4 and DD2, the probabilities that GW230529 can make tidal disruption are $12.8\%$ and $63.2\%$, respectively. If GW230529 is a disrupted event, the associated kilonova is predicted to have an apparent magnitude of $\sim23-24\,{\rm{mag}}$, and hence, can be detected by the present survey projects and LSST. Since GW230529 could be an off-axis event inferred from the GW observation, its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) might be too dim to be observed by $\gamma$-ray detectors, interpreting the lack of GRB observations. The detection of GW230529 confirms the existence of mgBHNS mergers formed through the isolated binary evolution channel, suggesting that BHNS mergers are still likely to be multimessenger sources that emit GWs, GRBs, and kilonovae. Although mgBHNS mergers account for $\sim60\%$ cosmological BHNS population, we find that $\gtrsim90\%$ disrupted BHNS mergers are expected to originate from mgBHNS mergers.

2024-04-16, **Impacts of stellar wind and supernovae on the star cluster formation: origins of extremely high N/O ratios and multiple stellar populations**, Hajime Fukushima et.al., [2404.10535v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10535v1)

 We study metal enrichment originating from stellar wind and supernovae in low-metallicity clouds by performing three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We find that metals ejected from stellar wind are accumulated, leading to subsequent star formation in the nitrogen-enriched gas. During this early phase, the N/O ratios are similar to observed nitrogen-enriched galaxies (${\rm [N/O]}\gtrsim0.5$). Then, once supernovae occur, the N/O ratios decrease significantly. If the duration of star formation is comparable to the timescale of SNe, the mass fraction of nitrogen-enriched stars reaches half the mass of star clusters. We suggest that the mass of the star cluster needs to exceed $\sim 10^6~M\_{\odot}$ to have multiple populations due to stellar wind, considering the condition for massive star cluster formation and the timescales of stellar evolution.

2024-04-15, **The Environmental Dependence of the Stellar Mass - Gas Metallicity Relation in Horizon Run 5**, Aaron R. Rowntree et.al., [2404.10055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10055v1)

 Metallicity offers a unique window into the baryonic history of the cosmos, being instrumental in probing evolutionary processes in galaxies between different cosmic environments. We aim to quantify the contribution of these environments to the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) of galaxies. By analysing the galaxy distribution within the cosmic skeleton of the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation at redshift $z = 0.625$, computed using a careful calibration of the T-ReX filament finder, we identify galaxies within three main environments: nodes, filaments and voids. We also classify galaxies based on the dynamical state of the clusters and the length of the filaments in which they reside. We find that the cosmic environment significantly contributes to the scatter in the MZR; in particular, both the gas metallicity and its average relative standard deviation increase when considering denser large-scale environments. The difference in the average metallicity between galaxies within relaxed and unrelaxed clusters is $\approx 0.1 \text{ dex}$, with both populations displaying positive residuals, $\delta Z\_{g}$, from the averaged MZR. Moreover, the difference in metallicity between node and void galaxies accounts for $\approx 0.14 \, \text{dex}$ in the scatter of the MZR at stellar mass $M\_{\star} \approx 10^{9.35}\,\text{M}\_{\odot}$. Finally, both the average [O/Fe] in the gas and the galaxy gas fraction decrease when moving to higher large-scale densities in the simulation, suggesting that the cores of cosmic environments host, on average, older and more massive galaxies, whose enrichment is affected by a larger number of Type Ia Supernova events.

2024-04-15, **Deep JWST/NIRCam imaging of Supernova 1987A**, Mikako Matsuura et.al., [2404.10042v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10042v1)

 JWST/NIRCam obtained high angular-resolution (0.05-0.1''), deep near-infrared 1--5 micron imaging of Supernova (SN) 1987A taken 35 years after the explosion. In the NIRCam images, we identify: 1) faint H2 crescents, which are emissions located between the ejecta and the equatorial ring, 2) a bar, which is a substructure of the ejecta, and 3) the bright 3-5 micron continuum emission exterior to the equatorial ring. The emission of the remnant in the NIRCam 1-2.3 micron images is mostly due to line emission, which is mostly emitted in the ejecta and in the hot spots within the equatorial ring. In contrast, the NIRCam 3-5 micron images are dominated by continuum emission. In the ejecta, the continuum is due to dust, obscuring the centre of the ejecta. In contrast, in the ring and exterior to the ring, synchrotron emission contributes a substantial fraction to the continuum.   Dust emission contributes to the continuum at outer spots and diffuse emission exterior to the ring, but little within the ring. This shows that dust cooling and destruction time scales are shorter than the synchrotron cooling time scale, and the time scale of hydrogen recombination in the ring is even longer than the synchrotron cooling time scale.   With the advent of high sensitivity and high angular resolution images provided by JWST/NIRCam, our observations of SN 1987A demonstrate that NIRCam opens up a window to study particle-acceleration and shock physics in unprecedented details, probed by near-infrared synchrotron emission, building a precise picture of how a SN evolves.

2024-04-15, **The "C": The large Chameleon-Musca-Coalsack cloud**, Gordian Edenhofer et.al., [2404.09592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09592v1)

 Recent advancements in 3D dust mapping have transformed our understanding of the Milky Way's local interstellar medium (ISM), enabling us to explore its structure in three spatial dimensions for the first time. In this letter, we use the Edenhofer et al. (2023) 3D dust map to study the well-known Chameleon, Musca, and Coalsack cloud complexes, located about 200 pc from the Sun. We find that these three complexes are not isolated but rather connect to form a surprisingly well-defined half-ring, constituting a single "C"-shaped cloud with a radius of about 50 pc, a thickness of about 45 pc, and a total mass of about $9 \times 10^{4}~\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$. Despite the absence of an evident feedback source at its center, the dynamics of young stellar clusters associated with the "C" structure suggest that a single supernova explosion about 4 Myr to 10 Myr ago likely shaped this structure. Our findings support a single origin story for these cloud complexes, suggesting that they were formed by feedback-driven gas compression. This interpretation challenges scenarios in which magnetic fields are the primary drivers behind the formation of star-forming molecular clouds in this region, offering new insights into the processes that govern the birth of star-forming clouds in feedback-dominated regions, such as Sco-Cen.
