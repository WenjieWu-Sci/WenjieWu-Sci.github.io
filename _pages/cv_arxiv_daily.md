2023-03-30, **The ESSnuSB design study: overview and future prospects**, ESSnuSB Collaboration et.al., [2303.17356v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17356v1)

 ESSnuSB is a design study for an experiment to measure the CP violation in the leptonic sector at the second neutrino oscillation maximum using a neutrino beam driven by the uniquely powerful ESS linear accelerator. The reduced impact of systematic errors on sensitivity at the second maximum allows for a very precise measurement of the CP violating parameter. This review describes the fundamental advantages of measurement at the 2nd maximum, the necessary upgrades to the ESS linac in order to produce a neutrino beam, the near and far detector complexes, the expected physics reach of the proposed ESSnuSB experiment, concluding with the near future developments aimed at the project realization.

2023-03-30, **Neutrinoless double beta decay as seen by the devil's advocate**, Gia Dvali et.al., [2303.17261v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17261v1)

 Neutrinoless double beta decay is the textbook example of lepton number violation, often claimed to be a probe of neutrino Majorana mass. However, it could be triggered by new physics; after all, neutrino Majorana mass requires physics beyond the Standard Model. If at least one electron were right-handed, it would automatically signify new physics rather than neutrino mass. In case both electrons were left-handed, the situation would become rather complicated, and additional effort would be needed to untangle the source for this process. We offer a comprehensive study of this issue from both the effective operator approach and the possible UV completions, including the Pati-Salam quark-lepton unification. While neutrino exchange is natural and physically preferred, our findings show that new physics can still be responsible for the neutrinoless double beta decay. In particular, the Pati-Salam theory can do the job, consistently with all the phenomenological and unification constraints, as long as the unification scale lies above 10^12 GeV, albeit at the price of fine-tuning of some scalar masses.

2023-03-30, **Hermitian Matrix Diagonalization and its Symmetry Properties**, S. H. Chiu et.al., [2303.17087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17087v1)

 A hermitian matrix can be parametrized by a set consisting of its determinant and the eigenvalues of its submatrices. We established a group of equations which connect these variables with the mixing parameters of diagonalization. These equations are simple in structure and manifestly invariant in form under the symmetry operations of dilatation, translation, rephasing and permutation. When applied to the problem of neutrino oscillation in matter they produced two new ``matter invariants" which are confirmed by available data.

2023-03-30, **Gravitational wave microlensing by dressed primordial black holes**, Juan Urrutia et.al., [2303.17601v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17601v1)

 We study gravitational wave microlensing by primordial black holes (PBHs), accounting for the effect of a particle dark matter minihalo surrounding them. Such minihaloes are expected when PBHs make up only a fraction of all dark matter. We find that the LIGO-Virgo detections imply a $1\sigma$ bound on the abundance of PBHs heavier than $50 M\_{\odot}$. The next generation observatories can potentially probe PBHs as light as $0.01 M\_\odot$ and down to $2\times10^{-4}$ fraction of all dark matter. We also show that these detectors can distinguish between dressed and naked PBHs, providing a novel way to study the distribution of particle dark matter around black holes and potentially shed light on the origins of black holes.

2023-03-30, **Constraining ultralight dark matter using the Fermi-LAT Pulsar Timing Array**, Zi-Qing Xia et.al., [2303.17545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17545v1)

 Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is proposed as a theoretical candidate of dark matter particles with masses of approximately $10^{-22}$ eV. The interactions between ULDM particles and standard model particles would cause variations in pulse arrival times of the pulsars, which makes the pulsar timing array (PTA) can be used to indirectly detect ULDM. In this work, we use the gamma-ray PTA composed of 29 millisecond pulsars observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) to test four ultralight dark matter effects, including gravitational effects for generalized ULDM with different Spin-0/1, the fifth-force coupling effect of Dark Photon and the modified gravitational effect of the Spin-2 ULDM. The gamma-ray pulsar timing is not affected by the ionized interstellar medium and suffers relatively simple noises, unlike that of the radio band. No significant signals of ULDM are found based on the Fermi-LAT PTA for all four kinds of ULDM models. Constraints on ULDM parameters are set with the 95% confidence level, which provides a complementary check of the non-detection of ULDM for radio PTAs and direct detection experiments.

2023-03-30, **Reference frames in General Relativity and the galactic rotation curves**, L. Filipe O. Costa et.al., [2303.17516v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17516v1)

 The physical interpretation of the exact solutions of the Einstein field equations is, in general, a challenging task, part of the difficulties lying in the significance of the coordinate system. We discuss the extension of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reference system to the exact theory. It is seen that such an extension, retaining some of its crucial properties, can be achieved in a special class of spacetimes, admitting non-shearing congruences of observers which, at infinity, have zero vorticity and acceleration. As applications, we consider the FLRW, Kerr and NUT spacetimes, the van Stockum rotating dust cylinder, spinning cosmic strings and, finally, we debunk the so-called Balasin-Grumiller (BG) model, and the claims that the galaxies' rotation curves can be explained through gravitomagnetic effects without the need for Dark Matter. The BG spacetime is shown to be completely inappropriate as a galactic model: its dust is actually static with respect to the asymptotic inertial frame, its gravitomagnetic effects arise from unphysical singularities along the axis (a pair of NUT rods, combined with a spinning cosmic string), and the rotation curves obtained are merely down to an invalid choice of reference frame -- the congruence of zero angular momentum observers, which are being dragged by the singularities.

2023-03-30, **A cosmic stream of atomic carbon gas connected to a massive radio galaxy at redshift 3.8**, Bjorn H. C. Emonts et.al., [2303.17484v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17484v1)

 The growth of galaxies in the early Universe is driven by accretion of circum- and inter-galactic gas. Simulations predict that steady streams of cold gas penetrate the dark matter halos of galaxies, providing the raw material necessary to sustain star formation. We report a filamentary stream of gas that extends for 100 kiloparsecs and connects to the massive radio galaxy 4C 41.17. The stream is detected using sub-millimeter observations of the [CI] line of atomic carbon, a tracer of neutral atomic or molecular hydrogen gas. The galaxy contains a central gas reservoir that is fueling a vigorous starburst. Our results show that the raw material for star formation can be present in cosmic streams outside galaxies.

2023-03-30, **Constraining the Gravitational Potential from the Projected Morphology of Extragalactic Tidal Streams**, Jacob Nibauer et.al., [2303.17406v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17406v1)

 The positions and velocities of stellar streams have been used to constrain the mass and shape of the Milky Way's dark matter halo. Several extragalactic streams have already been detected, though it has remained unclear what can be inferred about the gravitational potential from only 2D photometric data of a stream. We present a fast method to infer halo shapes from the curvature of 2D projected stream tracks. We show that the stream curvature vector must point within 90 deg of the projected acceleration vector, in the absence of recent time-dependent perturbations. While insensitive to the total magnitude of the acceleration, and therefore the total mass, applying this constraint along a stream can determine halo shape parameters and place limits on disk-to-halo mass ratios. The most informative streams are those with sharp turns or flat segments, since these streams sample a wide range of curvature vectors over a small area (sharp turns) or have a vanishing projected acceleration component (flat segments). We apply our method to low surface brightness imaging of NGC 5907, and find that its dark matter halo is oblate. Our analytic approach is significantly faster than other stream modeling techniques, and indicates what parts of a stream contribute to constraints on the potential. The method enables a measurement of dark matter halo shapes for thousands of systems using stellar stream detections expected from upcoming facilities like Rubin and Roman.

2023-03-30, **Annihilation of singlet fermionic dark matter into two photons via pseudo-scalar mediator**, M. M. Ettefaghi et.al., [2303.17107v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17107v1)

 We consider the indirect detection of dark matter within an extension of the standard model (SM) including a singlet fermion as cold dark matter (CDM) and a singlet pseudo-scalar as a mediator between dark matter and the SM particles. The annihilation cross section of the CDM into two monochromatic photons is calculated and compared with the latest H.E.S.S. data. Although for dark matter masses below 1 TeV the predicted observable cross sections are far from the sensitivity of the recent gamma-ray experiments,   it can be comparable to the strongest H.E.S.S. upper bounds for some models with more massive CDM.
