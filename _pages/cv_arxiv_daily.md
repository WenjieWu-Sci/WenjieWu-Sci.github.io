2025-11-18, **First measurement of reactor neutrino oscillations at JUNO**, Angel Abusleme et.al., [2511.14593v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14593v1)

 Neutrino oscillations, a quantum effect manifesting at macroscopic scales, are governed by lepton flavor mixing angles and neutrino mass-squared differences that are fundamental parameters of particle physics, representing phenomena beyond the Standard Model. Precision measurements of these parameters are essential for testing the completeness of the three-flavor framework, determining the mass ordering of neutrinos, and probing possible new physics. The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a 20 kton liquid-scintillator detector located 52.5 km from multiple reactor cores, designed to resolve the interference pattern of reactor neutrinos with sub-percent precision. Here we report, using the first 59.1 days of data collected since detector completion in August 2025, the first simultaneous high-precision determination of two neutrino oscillation parameters, $\sin^2 θ\_{12} = 0.3092\,\pm\,0.0087$ and $Δm^2\_{21} = (7.50\,\pm\,0.12)\times10^{-5}\;{\rm eV}^2$ for the normal mass ordering scenario, improving the precision by a factor of 1.6 relative to the combination of all previous measurements. These results advance the basic understanding of neutrinos, validate the detector's design, and confirm JUNO's readiness for its primary goal of resolving the neutrino mass ordering with a larger dataset. The rapid achievement with a short exposure highlights JUNO's potential to push the frontiers of precision neutrino physics and paves the way for its broad scientific program.

2025-11-18, **Initial performance results of the JUNO detector**, Angel Abusleme et.al., [2511.14590v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14590v1)

 The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) started physics data taking on 26 August 2025. JUNO consists of a 20-kton liquid scintillator central detector, surrounded by a 35 kton water pool serving as a Cherenkov veto, and almost 1000 m$^2$ of plastic scintillator veto on top. The detector is located in a shallow underground laboratory with an overburden of 1800 m.w.e. This paper presents the performance results of the detector, extensively studied during the commissioning of the water phase, the subsequent liquid scintillator filling phase, and the first physics runs. The liquid scintillator achieved an attenuation length of 20.6 m at 430 nm, while the high coverage PMT system and scintillator together yielded about 1785 photoelectrons per MeV of energy deposit at the detector centre, measured using the 2.223 MeV $γ$ from neutron captures on hydrogen with an Am-C calibration source. The reconstructed energy resolution is 3.4% for two 0.511 MeV $γ$ at the detector centre and 2.9% for the 0.93 MeV quenched Po-214 alpha decays from natural radioactive sources. The energy nonlinearity is calibrated to better than 1%. Intrinsic contaminations of U-238 and Th-232 in the liquid scintillator are below 10$^{-16}$ g/g, assuming secular equilibrium. The water Cherenkov detector achieves a muon detection efficiency better than 99.9% for muons traversing the liquid scintillator volume. During the initial science runs, the data acquisition duty cycle exceeded 97.8%, demonstrating the excellent stability and readiness of JUNO for high-precision neutrino physics.

2025-11-18, **Solar carbon abundance from 3D non-LTE modelling of the diagnostic lines of the CH molecule**, Richard Hoppe et.al., [2511.14289v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14289v1)

 Context. The spectral lines of the CH molecule are a key carbon (C) abundance diagnostic in FGKM-type stars. These lines are detectable in metal-rich and, in contrast to atomic C lines, also in metal-poor late-type stars. However, only 3D LTE analyses of the CH lines have been performed so far.   Aims. We test the formation of CH lines in the solar spectrum, using for the first time, 3D Non-LTE (NLTE) models. We also aim to derive the solar photospheric abundance of C, using the diagnostic transitions in the optical (4218 - 4356 Å) and infrared (33025 - 37944 Å).   Methods. We use the updated NLTE model molecule from Popa et al. (2023) and different solar 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model atmospheres. The models are contrasted against new spatially-resolved optical solar spectra, and the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of CH lines is studied.   Results. The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE models fail to describe the line CLV, and lead to underestimated solar C abundances. The 3D NLTE modelling of diagnostic lines in the optical and IR yields a carbon abundance of A(C)=$8.52\pm0.07$ dex. The estimate is in agreement with recent results based on neutrino fluxes measured by Borexino.   Conclusions. 3D NLTE modelling and tests on spatially-resolved solar data are essential to derive robust solar abundances. The analysis presented here focuses on CH, but we expect that similar effects will be present for other molecules of astrophysical interest.

2025-11-17, **Search for Double Beta Decays of $^{134}$Xe with EXO-200 Phase II**, S. Al Kharusi et.al., [2511.13990v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13990v1)

 EXO-200 was a leading double beta decay experiment consisting of a single-phase, enriched liquid xenon time projection chamber filled with an admixture of 80.672% $^{136}$Xe and 19.098% $^{134}$Xe. The detector operated at WIPP between 2010 and 2018 and was designed to search for double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe. Data was acquired in two phases separated by a period of detector upgrades. We report on the search for $0νββ$ and $2νββ$ decay of $^{134}$Xe with Phase II EXO-200 data, with median 90% C.L. exclusion sensitivity $T\_{1/2}^{0ν} \geq 3.7\times 10^{23}$ yr and $T\_{1/2}^{2ν} \geq 2.6 \times 10^{21}$ yr, respectively. No statistically significant signal is observed for either decay mode. We set a world-leading lower limit on the half-life of the neutrinoless decay mode of $^{134}$Xe of $T\_{1/2}^{0ν} \geq 8.7\times10^{23}$ (90% C.L.) and the second strongest constraint on the two-neutrino decay of $T\_{1/2}^{2ν} \geq 2.9\times10^{21}$ (90% C.L.), a 3-fold improvement over the EXO-200 Phase I measurement. New constraints are also set for the $2νββ$ and $0νββ$ decays of $^{134}$Xe to the lowest excited state of $^{134}$Ba.

2025-11-17, **Blazars as a Potential Origin of the KM3-230213A Event**, The KM3NeT Collaboration et.al., [2511.13886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13886v1)

 The KM3NeT collaboration has reported the detection of the highest energy neutrino event observed to date. The energy of the event is of the order of 220 PeV hinting towards a neutrino flux at the highest energies. In this article, the potential blazar origin for this event is explored. The publicly available Astro-Multimessenger Modeling software is used to model the blazar gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes. It is concluded that a population of blazars could produce the diffuse flux compatible with the observation of the ultra-high energy event detected by the KM3NeT/ARCA detector. At the same time, the gamma-ray flux produced by such a population of blazars is consistent with the diffuse gamma-ray flux measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope.

2025-11-17, **The Scoured Spike: Suppression of Indirect Dark Matter Signals by a Hidden Companion**, Jaden Lopez et.al., [2511.13858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13858v1)

 A massive "dark companion"-such as an intermediate-mass black hole or other compact dark object-orbiting the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center can dynamically reshape the surrounding dark-matter spike. Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a "scoured" region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $γ\_{\rm sp} \gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $γ\_{\rm sp} \lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\sim 10^{4}\,M\_\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude. The numerical results are accurately captured (typically at the $\lesssim 10\%$ level) by a simple fitting formula in terms of a dimensionless scouring parameter that measures the ratio between the scoured region and the annihilation core. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter.

2025-11-17, **Galaxy Mergers Collectively Illuminate the $γ$-Ray Sky**, Jaya Doliya et.al., [2511.13818v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13818v1)

 The origin and acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays (CRs) remain fundamental open questions. Galaxy mergers are proposed as very high-energy CR accelerators, which are expected to produce high-energy (HE) $γ$ rays and neutrinos through interactions with the ambient gas and low-energy background radiation fields. For the first time, we systematically study the HE $γ$-ray emission from galaxy mergers utilising 16.7 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) data with the sample list compiled from eight survey catalogs. Our analysis finds 8 galaxy mergers that exhibit $γ$-ray emission with significance $\gtrsim5σ$ in the 1-500 GeV energy range. A stacking analysis of the remaining faint galaxy mergers yields a combined $γ$-ray emission detected at $\sim 35σ$ significance, a best-fit spectral index of $Γ\approx 2.07$, and an energy flux of $\sim \rm 2\times10^{-14}~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$. We compare the stacked spectral energy distributions of the galaxy mergers with the projected sensitivity of the upcoming $γ$-ray telescope Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Furthermore, we find that 18 previously unassociated Fermi-LAT sources are spatially coincident with galaxy mergers. Our findings establish galaxy mergers as a new class of HE $γ$-ray sources. Future neutrino and $γ$-ray observatories will be crucial to discover the particle acceleration mechanism in these newly identified CR sources.

2025-11-17, **Bounds on Exotic Couplings from a New $ν$-Background**, Indra Kumar Banerjee et.al., [2511.13673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13673v1)

 We propose a hitherto unexplored neutrino background emerging from the mechanism of quenched superradiance of rotating primordial black holes. The quenching of the phenomenon happens through fermionic production, in our case neutrino production, from the boson cloud formed due to superradiance. The couplings involved in these interactions are bounded from above through several studies. In this work we put lower bounds on such scalar and vector couplings.

2025-11-17, **Multi Messenger Study of GRB 221009A with VHE Gamma-ray and Neutrino Afterglow from a Gaussian Structured Jet**, T. Mondal et.al., [2511.13633v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13633v1)

 Recent detections of very-high-energy (VHE; $\gtrsim 100$~GeV) emission from GRB afterglows, notably the unprecedented brightness of GRB~221009A observed by LHAASO, reveal emission components beyond the standard electron synchrotron model. Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $pγ$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals.

2025-11-17, **Probing Dark Sector Particles Coupling to Neutrinos with Double Beta Decay**, Noor-Ines Boudjema et.al., [2511.13606v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13606v1)

 Motivated by the observation of non-zero neutrino masses and the potential for discovering physics beyond the Standard Model, numerous experiments are actively searching for neutrinoless double beta $(0νββ)$ decay. In all of these searches, a substantial amount of data on two-neutrino double beta $(2νββ)$ decay has been collected. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of current and future double beta decay experiments to a massive Majoron-like scalar particle coupled to neutrinos and potentially dark sector fermions, and compare their reach to the relevant cosmological constraints. On- and off-shell production of such scalar particles leads to characteristic distortions in the double beta decay electron spectrum. We investigate how these distortions would manifest in current and future double beta decay experiments, deriving the sensitivity to such scenarios. We project the reach of future experiments which can probe scalar-neutrino couplings of $\|a\_ν\| \approx 2\times 10^{-6}$ for sub-MeV scalar particles and remain sensitive to off-shell production above the Q-value of double beta decay isotopes.

2025-11-17, **Probing scalar-neutrino and scalar-dark-matter interactions with PandaX-4T**, PandaX Collaboration et.al., [2511.13515v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13515v1)

 Scalar-mediated interactions may exist among neutrinos, dark matter particles, or between the two. Double $β$-decay experiments provide a powerful tool to probe such exotic interactions. Using $^{136}$Xe double $β$-decay data from PandaX-4T, we perform the first direct spectral search in the energy range of 20 to 2800~keV, setting the most stringent limits to date on scalar-mediated neutrino self-interactions for mediator masses below 2~MeV$/c^2$. These results place significant constraints on models invoking such interactions to alleviate the Hubble Tension. Assuming the same scalar also mediates dark matter self-interactions, constraints on the dark matter-scalar interactions can be placed in conjunction with cosmological constraints.

2025-11-17, **Measurement of Exclusive $π^+$--argon Interactions Using ProtoDUNE-SP**, DUNE Collaboration et.al., [2511.13462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13462v1)

 We present the measurement of $π^{+}$--argon inelastic cross sections using the ProtoDUNE Single-Phase liquid argon time projection chamber in the incident $π^+$ kinetic energy range of 500 -- 800 MeV in multiple exclusive channels (absorption, charge exchange, and the remaining inelastic interactions). The results of this analysis are important inputs to simulations of liquid argon neutrino experiments such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment and the Short Baseline Neutrino program at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. They will be employed to improve the modeling of final state interactions within neutrino event generators used by these experiments, as well as the modeling of $π^{+}$--argon secondary interactions within the liquid argon. This is the first measurement of $π^+$--argon absorption at this kinetic energy range as well as the first ever measurement of $π^{+}$--argon charge exchange.

2025-11-17, **Prospects for detecting periodic or sharp fast-time features in the supernova neutrino lightcurve with IceCube**, Jakob Beise et.al., [2511.13148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13148v1)

 Neutrinos produced in core-collapse supernova offer a direct probe into the hydrodynamics and energy transport mechanisms during the collapse and play a pivotal role in the shock revival and success of the supernova explosion. Fast-time features of the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum encode information about phenomena such as turbulence, convection, shock revival and potential quark-hadron phase transitions. In this study, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes with a focus on IceCube and the planned extension IceCube-Gen2. Furthermore, we consider the effect on the detection sensitivity from wavelength shifters through enhanced light collection.   A variety of models predict periodic fast-time features in supernova light curves; to quantify their detectability without relying on specific models, we investigate the detector response to a generic parameterisation of such features. We find that independent of feature frequency, IceCube-Gen2 instrumented with wavelength shifters has sensitivity to weaker modulations ($>25\%$ amplitude) as compared to only the strongest modulations ($>50\%$ amplitude) with IceCube. In addition, we examine the sensitivity of the neutrino lightcurve to sharp features from a quark-hadron phase transition. Phase transitions leading to a quark star remnant are detectable with IceCube at $5σ$ up to the edge of the Galaxy, and throughout the Small Magellanic Cloud with IceCube-Gen2 equipped with wavelength-shifters. In contrast, models collapsing into a black hole are observable only within the Galaxy, covering $41\%$ of the CCSNe population for IceCube and nearly all ($91\%$) for IceCube-Gen2 complemented by wavelength shifters. These results highlight the potential of IceCube-Gen2 for detecting Galactic sources more reliably and with greater reach.

2025-11-17, **NuBench: An Open Benchmark for Deep Learning-Based Event Reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes**, Rasmus F. Orsoe et.al., [2511.13111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13111v1)

 Neutrino telescopes are large-scale detectors designed to observe Cherenkov radiation produced from neutrino interactions in water or ice. They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods.   We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation.

2025-11-18, **Constraining the Nature of Dark Matter from Tidal Radii of Cluster Galaxy Subhalos**, Barry T. Chiang et.al., [2511.14726v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14726v1)

 Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters provides a powerful probe of the spatial distribution of dark matter and its microphysical properties. Strong and weak lensing constraints on the density profiles of subhalos and their truncation radii offer key diagnostics for distinguishing between collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Notably, in the strongly collisional SIDM regime, subhalo core collapse and enhanced mass loss from ram-pressure stripping predict steeper central density slopes and more compact truncation radii--features that are directly testable with current lensing data. We analyze subhalo truncation in eight lensing clusters (Abell 2218, 383, 963, 209, 2390, and MACS J0416.1, J1206.2, J1149.6) that span the redshift range <$z\_\text{spec}$>$ \simeq 0.17$-$0.54$ with virial masses $M\_{200} \simeq0.41$-$2.2\times 10^{15}$ M$\_\odot$ to constrain SIDM versus CDM. Our results indicate that the outer spatial extents of subhalos are statistically consistent with CDM, corroborated by redshift- and mass-matched analogs from the Illustris-TNG simulations. We conclude that the tidal radii of cluster galaxy subhalos serve as an important and complementary diagnostic of the nature of dark matter in these violent, dense environments.

2025-11-18, **Equilateral non-Gaussian Bias at the Field Level**, Divij Sharma et.al., [2511.14677v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14677v1)

 Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) is a common prediction of a wide class of inflationary models. Equilateral-type PNG, generically predicted by single-field inflationary models with higher-derivative interactions, imprints subtle but measurable signatures on the large-scale distribution of matter. An important parameter of these imprints is the PNG-induced bias coefficient $b\_ψ$, which quantifies how the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos and galaxies respond to mode coupling in the initial conditions. Measuring $b\_ψ$ is important for constraining equilateral PNG, yet it is notoriously challenging due to its degeneracy with Gaussian scale-dependent bias contributions. In this work, we present the first precision measurements of equilateral $b\_ψ$ for dark matter halos using effective field theory at the field level. We show that this approach disentangles PNG effects from those of the Gaussian bias by virtue of noise variance cancellation. We compare our results with the phenomenological predictions based on the Peak-Background Split model, finding some agreement at the qualitative level on the redshift and mass dependence, but poor agreement at the quantitative level. We present a fitting formula for $b\_ψ$ as a function of the linear bias, which can be used to set priors in PNG searches with ongoing and future galaxy surveys.

2025-11-18, **High-resolution weak lensing mass mapping from DES-Y3 data using diffusion-based prior**, Supranta S. Boruah et.al., [2511.14667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14667v1)

 High-resolution mapping of cosmic mass distribution is essential for a variety of astrophysical applications including understanding cosmic structure formation, and galaxy formation and evolution. However dark matter is not directly observed and therefore we need advanced methods for solving inverse problems to reconstruct the underlying cosmic matter distribution. Here, we train a generative diffusion model and use it in the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) framework to reconstruct mass maps from Dark Energy Survey-Year 3 (DES-Y3) weak gravitational lensing data at high (1 arcminute) resolution. We show that the standard DPS results are biased, but they can be easily corrected by scaling the log-likelihood score during the diffusion process, yielding unbiased results with proper uncertainty quantification. The resulting mass maps reveal cosmic structures with enhanced detail, opening the door for improved astrophysical studies using the obtained mass maps.

2025-11-18, **Probing the Phenomenology of Dark Matter from Decoupled Freeze-Out**, Geneviève Bélanger et.al., [2511.14635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14635v1)

 We consider a model of dark matter where the mediator corresponds to a superposition of a scalar and pseudoscalar, and the scenario where, after reheating, the number densities of the dark sector particles, i.e. the dark matter and the mediators, are negligible. If the coupling of the mediators to the Standard Model is feeble, but the coupling to the dark matter is large enough, the dark sector may reach equilibrium at a temperature distinct from that of the thermal bath. The relic density is then said to be obtained via decoupled freeze out (DFO). We focus on the $s$-wave annihilation scenario, which particularly benefits from the DFO mechanism by evading standard CMB limits while still yielding indirect detection signals. We calculate the relic density by solving a set of four coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities of the dark sector particles and the energy transfer from the light to dark sector. We finally perform a thorough analysis of experimental bounds on this scenario, namely from indirect detection and the CMB, as well as from BBN, and find that, while there are considerable constraints on the parameter space where the correct relic density is obtained, a viable region remains to be explored.

2025-11-18, **Impact of conversion-driven processes on singlet-doublet Majorana dark matter relic**, Partha Kumar Paul et.al., [2511.14571v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14571v1)

 The singlet-doublet dark matter model offers a rich framework for exploring the nature of dark matter (DM) through its unique fermion structure. In this model, the important parameters are singlet-doublet mass splitting $Δ{M}$, singlet-doublet mixing angle $\sinθ$, and DM mass $M\_{\rm DM}$. If the DM is assumed to be of Dirac nature, then the annihilation, co-annihilation, and conversion driven processes combinedly allows a range of parameter space: $1~{\rm GeV} \lesssim M\_{\rm DM}\lesssim750$ GeV and $10^{-6}\lesssim\sinθ\lesssim0.04$ for all $Δ{M}>1$ GeV. While the nature of DM either Dirac or Majorana is not known, in this work we assume the nature of singlet-doublet DM to be of Majorana type and find that the relic density and direct detection can be satisfied in a larger parameter space. In particular, the allowed ranges of DM mass and $\sinθ$ are: $1~{\rm GeV}\lesssim M\_{\rm DM}\lesssim1750$ GeV and $2\times10^{-7}\lesssim\sinθ\lesssim0.16$ for all $Δ{M}>1$ GeV.

2025-11-18, **Early Universe Constraints on Variations in Fundamental Constants Induced by Ultralight Scalar Dark Matter**, Subhajit Ghosh et.al., [2511.14532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14532v1)

 We study the cosmological impact of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) with a quadratic coupling to Standard Model particles. In addition to the suppression of small-scale power from ULDM itself, the coupling induces a variation of fundamental constants that is modulated by the ULDM oscillatory field value. In this work, we consider the ULDM-induced, time-dependent variation of the fine structure constant and the mass of the electron. These variations modify the predicted abundance of light elements during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the process of recombination, thereby affecting the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We use CMB anisotropy data and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements to obtain constraints on the variation of couplings over a wide range of ULDM masses. We self-consistently account for the modification of the primordial helium abundance during BBN in computing the CMB power spectra. We find that the allowed ULDM fraction of total dark matter abundance is more constrained for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-26}~\mathrm{eV}$ in the presence of the variations. Moreover, our constraints on the variational couplings for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-27}~\mathrm{eV}$ are stronger than the ones derived from the primordial helium abundance at BBN. Under our ULDM model, the variation of fundamental constants has no appreciable impact on the Hubble constant inferred from CMB data and thus does not present a viable solution to the Hubble tension.

2025-11-18, **Dark matter halos and transonic accretion flow**, Avijit Chowdhury et.al., [2511.14425v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14425v1)

 The interplay between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their surrounding environment is fundamental to understanding galactic evolution. This work investigates the influence of a cold dark matter (DM) halo on the dynamics of relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic SMBH. Modeling the spacetime geometry as a black hole embedded within various DM distributions, including those with a central density spike, we demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo, particularly one that is massive and compact, enhances the luminosity of the accretion disk. The dominant contribution to this luminosity originates from the inner regions of the flow, suggesting that luminosity measurements could serve as a valuable observational probe for the dense DM environments expected near galactic centers.

2025-11-18, **Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking as a Late-Time Trigger for Interacting Dark Energy**, Pradosh Keshav MV et.al., [2511.14235v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14235v1)

 Persistent tensions in the Hubble constant (H0) and the matter clustering parameter (S8) motivate late-time new physics that suppresses structure growth without significantly altering the background expansion history of the LambdaCDM model. We study a class of dark-sector dynamics in which a scalar dark energy field, governed by a Z2-symmetric quartic potential, interacts with dark matter through Yukawa and portal couplings. When the matter density drops below a critical threshold, a cosmological spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism generates a time-dependent vacuum expectation value v(a) and activates an effective coupling eta(a). This creates a symmetric phase (a <= ac) identical to LambdaCDM at early times, and a broken phase (a > ac) in which eta(a) > 0 transfers energy from dark matter to dark energy, suppressing linear structure growth. Using RSD, BAO, cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, and compressed Planck distance priors, we compare a fixed LambdaCDM background with a self-consistent coupled-scalar evolution. The RSD-only analysis shows a strong shift: the dynamical background gives Omega\_m ~ 0.31 +/- 0.10 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.59 +/- 0.01, while the fixed-background case gives Omega\_m ~ 0.20 +/- 0.09 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.75 +/- 0.05. In the full joint fit, we obtain Omega\_m = 0.29 +/- 0.01, H0 = 69.7 +/- 0.6 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and sigma8,0 = 0.78 +/- 0.01. A late-time interaction triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking can therefore damp structure growth and ease the S8 tension while leaving the expansion history and the inferred H0 essentially unchanged, suggesting distinct physical origins for the two tensions.

 In this work, we investigate late-time interacting cosmologies within the framework of generalized Rastall gravity, where the interaction arises naturally from the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. We formulate the background evolution of the dark sector as an autonomous dynamical system, defining interaction terms $Q\_1=α\,\dot{f}$ and $Q\_2=-\dot{f}\,(1+α)$, with $α$ a constant parameter and $f$ a time-dependent function. Three interaction cases are studied: $f \propto ρ\_m$, $f \propto ρ\_{de}$, and $f \propto ρ\_m + ρ\_{de}$, assuming a constant dark-energy equation of state $w\_{de}$. For each scenario, we derive the closed dynamical system in terms of the density parameters $(Ω\_{de}, Ω\_m)$, identify its fixed points, and analyze their stability across the parameter space. In this context, the phase-space exhibits a standard cosmological dynamics: an unstable radiation point, a transient matter saddle, and a stable late-time attractor with accelerated expansion. In addition, we utilize a joint likelihood analysis with Cosmic Chronometers, PantheonPlus, and DESI data to obtain marginalized parameter estimates at the $68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence levels, constraining the parameter space in each interaction model.

 We present the first exact, non-singular black hole solution in General Relativity sourced by a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar field. Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter. The model is testable via distinctive gravitational-wave signatures from its scalar hair.

 The flux of Hidden Sector particles from the Galactic halo reaching an underground detector can be significantly attenuated by interactions within the Earth for sufficiently large scattering crosssections. This attenuation gives rise to a characteristic daily modulation in the detection rate, due to Earth's rotation. We present results from a search for such a modulation using a 1.257 kg-day dataset collected with the DAMIC-M Low Background Chamber. A model-independent analysis reveals no significant modulation in the 1e- event rate over periods from 1 to 48 h, highlighting the excellent temporal stability of the detector. In a complementary model-dependent analysis, we target the expected daily modulation signature of Hidden Sector particles, with masses in the range [0.53,2] MeV/c2, interacting with electrons via a dark photon mediator. By leveraging the expected temporal evolution of the signal, we set improved constraints on Dark Matter masses below 1.2 MeV/c2, surpassing our previous limits.

 Throughout this paper, we conduct our discussion by a partial review of Elko's Hermiticity, introducing the Hermitian formulation for interacting mass dimension one fermions based on Elko spinor. It includes pivotal observations about renormalizability and the study of some allowed interactions. Beyond these points, since dark-matter phenomenology is mainly connected to gravitation, we introduce original remarks on how the Hermitian prescription can be readily generalized to include curved space-time, considering the very definition of the Elko spinor structure. We establish the Elko dual as arising from the path-integral formulation of a more fundamental structure. It enables one to include a curved background space-time and also quantum gravity into our investigations.

2025-11-17, **Thermodynamic Origin of the Tully-Fisher Relation in Dark Matter Dominated Galaxies: A Theoretical-Empirical Derivation**, V. K. Oikonomou et.al., [2511.13929v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13929v1)

 In this work we introduce the concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, in the context of which dark matter is collisional and its equation of state is radius-dependent and has the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{ρ(r)}{ρ\_{\star}}\right)^{γ(r)}$. We confronted the effectively 2-parameter model with 174 galaxies from the SPARC data, and we found that the rotation curves of 100 galaxies can be perfectly fitted by the model. These galaxies are dark matter dominated, mostly dwarfs, low-luminosity and low-surface-brightness spiral galaxies. We demonstrate that scale-dependent self-interacting dark matter solves the cusp-core issue for dark matter dominated galaxies. More importantly, the structure of the scale-dependent SIDM model produces in a semi-theoretically and semi-empirically way the canonical Tully-Fisher and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relations when these 100 viable dwarfs, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity galaxies are taken into account. The behavior of the entropy function $K(r)$ is assumed to be $K(r)=K\_0\times\left(1+\frac{r}{r\_c}\right)^{-p}$. The perfect fits of the rotation curves come for a nearly isothermal and virialized dark matter halo, which naturally predicts the correlation $K\_0\sim V\_{\mathrm{max}}^2$. This correlation holds true empirically as confirmed by the data and we also find empirically $L\sim K\_0^2$ from the data, thus the canonical Tully-Fisher relation is reproduced semi-theoretically and semi-empirically. We perform the same task and we find theoretically, for dark matter dominated galaxies, that $K\_0\sim V\_{\mathrm{flat}}^2$ which is also confirmed empirically from the data, along with the correlation $K\_0\sim M\_b^{0.5}$, hence the baryonic Tully-Fisher law naturally emerges in a semi-theoretical and semi-empirical manner.

2025-11-17, **Gravitational Atom Spectroscopy**, Matteo Della Rocca et.al., [2511.13848v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13848v1)

 Black holes in our Universe are rarely truly isolated, being instead embedded in astrophysical environments such as plasma or dark matter. A particularly intriguing possibility is that light scalar fields form bound states around black holes, producing extended ''clouds'' known as gravitational atoms. When these clouds become sufficiently compact, the spacetime can no longer be described by a vacuum solution of General Relativity. In this regime, one can construct quasi-stationary, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar gravitational-atom configurations. Here, we explore an observationally relevant aspect of these systems by computing their fundamental quasi-normal mode. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the axial modes in both the time and frequency domains, finding frequency shifts relative to the vacuum case that depends mostly on the compactness of the gravitational atom. For sufficiently compact configurations, these shifts may be detectable by current or future gravitational wave detectors.

2025-11-17, **Aletheia: Emulating the non-linear matter power spectrum in the context of evolution mapping**, Ariel G. Sanchez et.al., [2511.13826v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13826v1)

 We present Aletheia, a new emulator of the non-linear matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, built upon the evolution mapping framework. This framework addresses the limitations of traditional emulation by focusing on $h$-independent cosmological parameters, which can be separated into those defining the linear power spectrum shape ($\mathbfΘ\_{\mathrm{s}}$) and those affecting only its amplitude evolution ($\mathbfΘ\_{\mathrm{e}}$). The combined impact of evolution parameters and redshift is compressed into a single amplitude parameter, $σ\_{12}$. Aletheia uses a two-stage Gaussian Process emulation: a primary emulator predicts the non-linear boost factor as a function of ($\mathbfΘ\_{\mathrm{s}}$) and $σ\_{12}$ for fixed evolution parameters, while a second one applies a small linear correction based on the integrated growth history. The emulator is trained on shape parameters spanning $\pm$5$σ$ of Planck constraints and a wide clustering range $0.2 < σ\_{12} < 1.0$, providing predictions for $0.006\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} < k < 2\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We validate Aletheia against N-body simulations, demonstrating sub-percent accuracy. When tested on a suite of dynamic dark energy models, the full emulator's predictions show a variance of approximately 0.2%, a factor of five smaller than that of the state-of-the-art EuclidEmulator2 (around 1% variance). Furthermore, Aletheia maintains sub-percent accuracy for the best-fit dynamic dark energy cosmology from recent DESI data, a model whose parameters lie outside the training ranges of most conventional emulators. This demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping approach, providing a robust and extensible tool for precision cosmology.

2025-11-17, **A model-independent assessment of the late-time dark energy density evolution**, Rayff de Souza et.al., [2511.13666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13666v1)

 Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $Λ$-Cold Dark Matter ($Λ$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $Λ$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $Λ$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.

 We present JWST observations of the radio galaxy TGSSJ1530+1049, spectroscopically confirmed at $z=4.0$. NIRCam images and NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopy ($R=2700$) show that TGSSJ1530+1049 is part of one of the densest-known structures of continuum and line-emitting objects found at these redshifts. NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3''x3'' IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc^2 area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log($M\_\star/M\_\odot)>10.3$) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 $M\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Using a stellar mass-based analysis, we predict a total dark matter halo mass of $\approx10^{13} M\_\odot$. Based on the physical separations and velocity differences between the galaxies, it is expected that these galaxies will merge to form a massive galaxy within a few Gyr. The system qualitatively resembles the forming brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations that form early through a rapid succession of mergers.

2025-11-17, **Identifying Charged Lepton-like Portal Matter at Future Colliders**, Thomas G. Rizzo et.al., [2511.13632v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13632v1)

 In the Kinetic Mixing (KM) portal scenario, the interaction of dark matter (DM) with the particles of the Standard Model (SM) is generated by diagrams connecting the familiar photon with its dark sector analog, the dark photon (DP), via loops of particles carrying both dark and SM quantum numbers, \ie, Portal Matter (PM). For the case of sub-GeV DM and DP, these PM states may lie in the $\sim 1-10$ TeV range and be potentially accessible at the HL-LHC as well as at other future lepton and hadron colliders. In perhaps the simplest scenario of this kind, PM consists of just a pair of electrically charged, iso- and color-singlet, vector-like (VL) fermions having opposite dark charges, with an $O(1)$ mass splitting, yielding a finite value for the strength of the KM, \ie, $ε\sim a~ few \times10^{-4}$. The dark Higgs induced mixing of PM states with their SM analogs allows for their decay but can also lead to significant distortions in the expected production properties for the PM at future lepton colliders due to $t$-channel dark Higgs exchange, potentially confusing PM identification. We show that the large set of clean observables available at lepton colliders is more that sufficient to resolve any of these ambiguities. The possibility of the production of like-sign PM fields via $t/u$-channel exchange of the same dark Higgs is also briefly explored.

 Dark matter detection experiments using liquid argon rely on a precise characterization of the ionization response to nuclear recoils, especially in the keV energy range relevant for light dark matter interactions. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis that combines new measurements from the ReD setup, part of the DarkSide experimental program, with calibration data from DarkSide-50, as well as results from the ARIS and SCENE experiments. These combined datasets enable improved constraints on atomic screening effects in the modeling of the ionization response of liquid argon to nuclear recoils. By including the updated ionization model into the DarkSide-50 analysis framework, we obtain stronger exclusion limits on low-mass WIMP interactions, setting new world-leading constraints in the 1-3 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass range. Finally, we recast the sensitivity projections for the upcoming DarkSide-20k detector, demonstrating a significantly enhanced discovery potential for low-mass dark matter candidates.

 Depleted p-channel field effect transistor detectors with repetitive-non-destructive readout (RNDR-DEPFETs) achieve a deep sub-electron noise by averaging several independent measurements of one single event. During the repetitive readout collected electrons are transferred between two readout nodes within each pixel to enable electron number-resolved measurements. The pixels serve as a unit cell of an active pixel sensor to achieve a high level of parallelization and fast readout. These properties are exploited in the DANAE experiment, which aims for the direct detection of light dark matter based with the event signature of electron recoils. We present the experimental characterization of an $64\times64$ RNDR-DEPFET pixel detector with a focus on the charge carrier generation rate. This technology achieves a high time resolution, which increases its sensitivity on rare events with a signal of two or more electrons due to the Poisson distribution of thermal generated electrons.

2025-11-17, **Probing the Nature of Dark Matter Self-Interactions Through Observations of Massive Black Hole Mergers**, Zachary J. Hoelscher et.al., [2511.13220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13220v1)

 Though the nature of dark matter remains elusive, two models have come to prominence with testable predictions: cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). While CDM remains the widely accepted model, SIDM was introduced to potentially help resolve the discrepancies between the predictions of the CDM model and observational data, in particular the predicted central density profiles. Previous work involving simulations of small numbers of Milky Way-mass galaxies shows that SIDM delays massive black hole mergers as compared to CDM when the host halo has a flattened central density profile. It is, however, unclear how well massive black hole observations are able to differentiate between CDM and SIDM. In this work, we use mock gravitational wave observations of massive black hole mergers from LISA, a space-based gravitational wave observatory set to launch in the 2030s, to test LISA's capability to indirectly probe dark matter physics. As a proof of concept, we show that LISA may be able to distinguish between CDM and SIDM with a short-range interaction and a constant cross section of 1 $\rm{cm^2~ g^{-1}}$ at the $\sim2σ$ level or greater, provided at least $\sim80$ massive black hole mergers are observed with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10. Our exploratory work shows that LISA may provide a pathway to probe dark matter self-interactions, motivating future work with more realistic, currently-favored models and larger simulation suites.

2025-11-17, **Numerical investigation of electrostatically confined excitons in monolayer $\text{MoSe}_2$**, Lefan Dolg et.al., [2511.13177v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13177v2)

 We investigate exciton confinement to a quantum wire in monolayer $\text{MoSe}\_2$ where the confinement is achieved by a p-i-n junction. We employ an effective-mass exciton model and solve the problem numerically, reflecting device geometries found in experimental state-of-the-art set up. Our method allows us to investigate the entire spectrum of confined states. We show the emergence of quantum confinement and study the dependence of the confined states as a function of electrical gate voltages, which are experimentally tunable parameters. We find that the confined states can be divided into bright and dark states with the dark states having small but finite oscillator strengths. Their oscillator strengths are low enough that they have not yet been detected in experiments, whereas the spectrum of the bright exciton states reproduces recent experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into the theoretical background of confined exciton states beyond the ground state and pave the way for the development of new confinement schemes as well as avenues to access the previously not detected dark states.

 This study investigates the accretion process and observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo. We examine the influence of the density ρ\_{s} and radius r\_{s} of the DM halo on key disk properties, including the energy flux, temperature distribution, and emission spectrum. Our results show that all three of these quantities decrease with increasing ρ\_{s} or r\_{s}. Furthermore, by generating and analyzing both direct and secondary images of the accretion disk, we explore how the observational inclination angle and the DM halo parameters ρ\_{s} and rs affect image profiles. Finally, the observed flux distributions are presented for different inclination angles. Our findings indicate that the accretion disk becomes colder and dimmer as the DM halo parameters increase, highlighting the significant role of DM in shaping BH observables.

 We show that the topology of the 21 cm forest carries cosmological information that is inaccessible to traditional amplitude- or correlation-based statistics. Applying topological data analysis to simulated spectra spanning a range of X-ray heating efficiencies and dark-matter free-streaming scales, we compute persistence diagrams and Betti-0 curves that describe the formation and merger hierarchy of absorption troughs. A small set of interpretable descriptors (trough-line density, lifetime variance, and lifetime skewness) respond in nearly orthogonal directions across the (f\_X, m\_WDM) parameter space, enabling a substantial reduction of the degeneracy between heating and dark-matter suppression. These topological signatures remain detectable under SKA1-Low-like thermal noise, demonstrating that topology provides a stable and non-Gaussian probe of small-scale physics during Cosmic Dawn.

 We study quasinormal modes of test scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac fields in the background of a new analytic regular black-hole solution obtained as an exact solution of the Einstein equations sourced by a Dehnen-type matter distribution in [R. A. Konoplya, A. Zhidenko, arXiv:2511.03066]. The metric is asymptotically flat and characterized by a simple lapse function $f(r)=1-2 M r^{2}/(r+a)^{3}$, where $M$ is the ADM mass and $a$ represents the characteristic scale of the surrounding dark-matter halo that regularizes the central region. The effective potentials for all perturbing fields possess the standard single-barrier form, ensuring linear stability and the applicability of the WKB formalism. The quasinormal frequencies are computed using the sixth- and ninth-order WKB methods with Padé corrections and verified by time-domain integration, both approaches showing excellent agreement. The parameter $a$ leads to a moderate increase in the real oscillation frequency, while the damping rate remains almost unchanged, producing only small corrections to the Schwarzschild spectrum. Since such deviations become appreciable only for unrealistically dense halos, our results confirm that the quasinormal spectrum of astrophysical black holes is safely unaffected by ordinary galactic dark-matter environments.

 The secondaries of the massive binary systems can be found as runaway stars after being ejected due to the supernova (SN) of the more massive component. We search for such stars inside the supernova remnants (SNRs), where a recent SN is guaranteed to have happened. In this paper, we present the massive runaway star HD~254577 as the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of the supernova remnant IC~443 and the neutron star (NS) CXOU~J61705.3$+$222127. We performed spectroscopic observations of the runaway star and specified its atmospheric parameters. Together with the precise \textit{Gaia} DR3 astrometry and photometry, we identified the possible birth origin of the runaway star, and by isochrone fitting, we determined the progenitor mass. From the \textit{Gaia} DR3 proper motions, we specified the possible explosion sites and calculated the neutron star (NS) velocity. HD~254577 is a hot and evolved star with an effective temperature of $24000\pm1000$ K (B0.5II) and a surface gravity of $\log({g~\rm[cm/s^2]})=2.75\pm0.25$. It is probably a single star with a peculiar 3-D velocity of $31.3^{+1.2}\_{-0.9}$ km~s$^{-1}$, lying at a heliocentric distance of $1701^{+55}\_{-54}$ pc. The cometary tail of the NS implies that it is moving away from the same site as the runaway star. From the flight trajectories, we calculated that the NS has typical pulsar velocities such as $254-539$ km~s$^{-1}$ at a distance of $1.7$ kpc for $10-20$ kyr ages. Together with the blue-only shifted interstellar medium lines on its spectrum, HD~254577 must be the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of IC~443. By identifying the pre-supernova companion and the possible parent cluster, we showed that the progenitor zero-age main sequence mass is high: $31-64$ M$\_\odot$. We also discuss the expansion dynamics of the SNR due to the highly off-centered explosion site.

 We investigate the impact of the Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton (BHL) accretion mechanism on the evolution of nova eruptions in symbiotic systems by systematically varying three key input parameters: the initial donor (asymptotic giant branch; AGB) mass, the initial white dwarf (WD) mass, and the initial binary separation ($a$). We explore models with AGB masses in the range $1.5$--$3.5\,{\rm M\_{\odot}}$, WD masses in the range $0.7$--$1.25\,{\rm M\_{\odot}}$, and separations in the range $1$--$8\,{\rm kR\_{\odot}}$. We find that all models exhibit a significant long-term orbital increase. This trend is primarily driven by the fact that approximately $99\%$ of the AGB mass is lost from the system, either directly via a wind that is not accreted by the WD, or accreted onto the WD and subsequently ejected during nova eruptions. As a result, the secular orbital response to mass loss or mass transfer dominates over angular-momentum-loss sinks that could otherwise shrink the orbit, producing a consistent orbital widening. Consequently, all WD masses gradually decrease with time. More massive WDs achieve higher mass-transfer efficiencies and accretion rates, leading to slightly higher mass-retention efficiencies per nova. However, because higher accretion rates also produce more frequent eruptions, the total WD mass lost over the AGB lifetime is larger in these systems. We conclude that symbiotic systems transferring mass via the BHL mechanism are unlikely to be viable progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.

 I identify a point-symmetric morphology in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant SNR G11.2-0.3 composed of three pairs of opposite morphological features, and attribute their shaping to three energetic pairs of jets during the explosion process in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The pairs of morphological features are two opposite rings, a strip of dense ejecta extending on both sides of the central pulsar PSR J1811-1925, and an ear-nozzle opposite structure. According to the JJEM, additional weaker pairs of jets may also have participated in the explosion. The jets' axis from the ear to the nozzle coincides with the axis of the presently active pulsar jets, which is the pulsar spin axis. The jets of this pair were the last that the newly born neutron star launched during the explosion, and the accretion disk that launched these jets spun up the neutron star in the same direction as the jets. The identification of a point-symmetric morphology in SNR G11.2-0.3 strengthens the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

2025-11-18, **On the impact of the supernova subsamples in reducing the Hubble tension**, Gonçalo Martins et.al., [2511.14332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14332v1)

 The persistent 4-6$σ$ difference between early- and late-time Hubble constant ($H\_{0}$) measurements, known as the "Hubble tension," is a major problem in modern cosmology. We study how differences in colour ($c$), stretch ($x\_{1}$), and host galaxy properties-stellar mass ($M$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR)-between calibration and Hubble Flow (HF) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) samples used by SH0ES affect SN luminosity standardization and $H\_{0}$ estimates. We generate subsamples from both, estimating $H\_{0}$, $M\_{B}$, $α$, $β$, $Δ\_{host}$, and $σ\_{int}$. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov to assess the consistency between subsamples and reveal how parameter estimates change as sample matching improves. The calibration sample is not fully representative of the HF sample, especially in $M$ and sSFR. Improving sample consistency leads to changes in $H\_{0}$, $M\_{B}$, $α$, and $σ\_{int}$, though overall values remain broadly stable. Better-matched subsamples tend to yield a mass step consistent with zero within 1$σ$. By disentangling SN subpopulations, we find persistent differences in $H\_{0}$ ($\sim$2-3$σ$) and $M\_{B}$ ($\sim2σ$) between low- and high-stretch SNe: $H\_{0} = 75.27 \pm 1.18$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for low-stretch and $H\_{0} = 71.25 \pm 1.59$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for high-stretch, resulting in Hubble tensions of 6.07$σ$ and 2.52$σ$. These differences suggest SNe Ia subpopulations with varying dust and intrinsic colour not captured by a single $β$, impacting cosmology. Estimating a single $H\_{0}$ for both subpopulations yields $H\_{0} = 73.78 \pm 2.17$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, with a much larger uncertainty that lowers the Hubble tension from $5.87σ$ to $\sim2.86σ$. Our results suggest that the mass step may arise from an over-correction of more than one SN subpopulation associated to different environments.

2025-11-18, **Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking as a Late-Time Trigger for Interacting Dark Energy**, Pradosh Keshav MV et.al., [2511.14235v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14235v1)

 Persistent tensions in the Hubble constant (H0) and the matter clustering parameter (S8) motivate late-time new physics that suppresses structure growth without significantly altering the background expansion history of the LambdaCDM model. We study a class of dark-sector dynamics in which a scalar dark energy field, governed by a Z2-symmetric quartic potential, interacts with dark matter through Yukawa and portal couplings. When the matter density drops below a critical threshold, a cosmological spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism generates a time-dependent vacuum expectation value v(a) and activates an effective coupling eta(a). This creates a symmetric phase (a <= ac) identical to LambdaCDM at early times, and a broken phase (a > ac) in which eta(a) > 0 transfers energy from dark matter to dark energy, suppressing linear structure growth. Using RSD, BAO, cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, and compressed Planck distance priors, we compare a fixed LambdaCDM background with a self-consistent coupled-scalar evolution. The RSD-only analysis shows a strong shift: the dynamical background gives Omega\_m ~ 0.31 +/- 0.10 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.59 +/- 0.01, while the fixed-background case gives Omega\_m ~ 0.20 +/- 0.09 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.75 +/- 0.05. In the full joint fit, we obtain Omega\_m = 0.29 +/- 0.01, H0 = 69.7 +/- 0.6 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and sigma8,0 = 0.78 +/- 0.01. A late-time interaction triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking can therefore damp structure growth and ease the S8 tension while leaving the expansion history and the inferred H0 essentially unchanged, suggesting distinct physical origins for the two tensions.

2025-11-18, **The Origin of the Mg-rich Supernova Remnant J0550-6823 and the Frequency of Similar Events in the Large Magellanic Cloud**, Yui Kuboike et.al., [2511.14126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14126v1)

 Shell burning and internal mixing in massive stars play an important role in setting the initial conditions for core-collapse supernova explosions. In the late stages of stellar evolution, intense shell burning can cause distinct convective regions to merge, fundamentally restructuring the stellar interior. Although such phenomena are difficult to observe directly, the observation of ``Mg-rich'' supernova remnants (SNRs) has recently emerged as a potential signature of these events. In this study, we reanalyze X-ray observations of J0550--6823, a SNR in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and a new candidate Mg-rich SNR. Our spectral analysis confirms a low Ne/Mg mass ratio of $\approx$1, and its classification as Mg-rich. By comparing the observational results with pre-supernova models, we suggest that the progenitor of J0550-6823 likely had an extended convective shell that reduces the Ne/Mg ratio prior to its explosion. Furthermore, we observe that $\sim$2--3 Mg-rich SNRs exist in the LMC, suggesting that $\lesssim$10--40\% of massive stars in the LMC may have had an extended convective shell, similar to what we observed in J0550-6823. This fraction would be important for understanding the final stages of the evolution of massive stars and galactic chemical evolution.

 White dwarfs which explode by the double-detonation mechanism may have a binary white dwarf donor which is subsequently ignited by its collision with the ejecta. This results in the destruction of the donor via either the triple- or quadruple-detonation mechanism, adding significant mass to the resulting ejecta as well as modifying its structure and composition. We simulate the evolution of supernova remnants resulting from such detonations in a variety of binary progenitors and compare them against a double detonation with a surviving donor. Because of the time delay between the detonations of the two white dwarfs, high-velocity ejecta from the first explosion governs the first few centuries of remnant evolution, whereas at later times the dense core resulting from the donor detonation drives both the forward and reverse shocks to larger radii. The collision between the highest-velocity ejecta of the primary explosion and the donor carves a conical wake into the ejecta, which persists into the remnant phase regardless of whether or not the donor detonates. Our suite of simulated remnants are found to exhibit multiple distinguishing features of the explosion properties: a distinct X-ray morphology in the thermal emission and iron lines for triple detonations and smaller remnants with centrally-concentrated emission for double detonations. The remnants are also varied in their elemental abundances and distributions, particularly for lighter elements, but these have limited observational utility and are sensitive to the properties of the progenitor binary.

 QCD axions would be copiously produced in the proto-neutron star formed in a core-collapse supernova (SN). After escaping, they would convert into gamma rays in the Galactic magnetic field and, as recently shown, in that of the progenitor star itself. Here, we show that Type Ibc SNe -- whose progenitors have lost their hydrogen or even helium envelopes -- are the optimal targets for this search. The stripped progenitors are much more compact, and show larger magnetic fields than both red and blue supergiants, the progenitors of Type IIP/L SNe. If the next galactic SN is of Type Ibc, Fermi-LAT or a similar gamma-ray satellite might be able to discover the QCD axion down to masses as small as $m\_a\simeq 10^{-4}\,\rm eV$ (Peccei-Quinn scale $f\_a\simeq 10^{11} \,\rm GeV$).

 Cosmic ray (CR) electrons are key tracers of non-thermal processes in galaxies, yet their spectra are often modelled under the untested assumption of steady state between injection and cooling. In this work, we present a time-dependent modelling of CR electron spectra in a galactic context using the CREST code, applied to magnetohydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-mass galaxy performed with AREPO. CR electrons are injected at supernova sites and evolved with adiabatic changes and cooling processes on Lagrangian tracer particles, including losses from synchrotron, inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung, and Coulomb interactions. We compare these fully time-dependent spectra to local and global steady-state models computed with CRAYON+, as well as to one-zone analytic steady-state solutions. We find that the global CR electron spectrum in the simulated galactic disk closely resembles a steady-state solution up to energies of 500 GeV, with deviations only at higher energies where cooling times become shorter than injection timescales. High-energy electrons are dominated by recently injected populations that have not yet reached equilibrium, however, producing a steeper spectrum and lower normalisation than a steady-state model predicts. Spatially, the electrons modelled on-the-fly with CREST are more confined to the star-forming disk, in contrast to the more extended distributions from steady-state post-processing models. Our results demonstrate that while steady-state assumptions capture the bulk CR electron population in star-forming disks, a time-dependent treatment is essential to describe the high-energy and outflowing components.

2025-11-17, **A model-independent assessment of the late-time dark energy density evolution**, Rayff de Souza et.al., [2511.13666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13666v1)

 Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $Λ$-Cold Dark Matter ($Λ$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $Λ$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $Λ$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.

2025-11-17, **A Fleeting GLIMPSE of N/O Enrichment at Cosmic Dawn: Evidence for Wolf Rayet N Stars in a z = 6.1 Galaxy**, Danielle A. Berg et.al., [2511.13591v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13591v1)

 We present the discovery of extreme nitrogen enrichment by Wolf Rayet nitrogen stars (WN) in the metal-poor ($\sim10\%Z\_\odot$), lensed, compact ($R\_{\rm eff}\sim20$ pc) galaxy RXCJ2248 at $z=6.1$, revealed by unprecedentedly deep JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy from the GLIMPSE-D Survey. The exquisite S/N reveals multiple high-ionization nebular lines and broad Balmer and [OIII] components (FWHM$\sim700-3000$ km s$^{-1}$). We detect broadened HeII $λ$1640 and $λ$4687 (FWHM$\sim530$ km s$^{-1}$) and strong NIII] $λ$4642 emission consistent with a population of WN stars, making RXCJ2248 the most distant galaxy with confirmed WR features to date. We measure the multi-phase nebular density across five ions, the direct-method metallicity ($12+\log(\rm O/H)= 7.749\pm0.023$), and a non-uniform elemental enrichment pattern of extreme N/O enhancement ($\log(\rm N/O)=-0.390\pm0.035$ from N$^+$, N$^{+2}$, and N$^{+3}$) and suppressed C/O relative to empirical C/N trends. We show that this abundance pattern can be explained by enrichment from a dual-burst with a low WC/WN ratio, as expected at low metallicities. Crucially, these signatures can only arise during a brief, rare evolutionary window shortly after a burst ($\sim3-6$ Myr), when WN stars dominate chemical feedback but before dilution by later yields (e.g., supernovae). The observed frequency of strong N emitters at high$-z$ implies a $\sim50$ Myr burst duty cycle, suggesting that N/O outliers may represent a brief but ubiquitous phase in the evolution of highly star-forming early galaxies. The detection in RXCJ2248, therefore, provides the first direct evidence of WN-driven chemical enrichment in the early Universe and a novel timing argument for the bursty star formation cycles that shaped galaxies at cosmic dawn.

2025-11-17, **Cosmic Expansion Driven by Gravitational Particle Production: Toward a Complete Cosmological Scenario**, P. W. R. Lima et.al., [2511.13392v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13392v1)

 A dark-energy-free cosmological model ($Ω\_{DE} \equiv 0$) based on gravitationally induced adiabatic particle creation is proposed. The thermodynamics of particle production yields an effective negative pressure that drives both primordial inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration. The model, characterized by four components and two free parameters ($α$, $β$), reproduces a $Λ$CDM-like expansion for suitable $α$, while $β$ introduces small but testable deviations from the cosmic concordance model. Constraints from type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+SH0ES) and H(z) data indicate $β\simeq 0.13$, suggesting a mild departure from standard cosmology and possible relief of the $H\_0$ and $S\_8$ tensions. The resulting classical cosmology evolves smoothly between two extreme de Sitter phases, offering a singularity-free, unified scenario that beyond solving old cosmological puzzles opens a new perspective to handle the tensions plaguing the current cosmic concordance model.

2025-11-17, **Constraining r-process nucleosynthesis with multi-objective Galactic chemical evolution models**, M. Molero et.al., [2511.13372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13372v1)

 The astrophysical site(s) of the r-process are uncertain, with candidates such as neutron star mergers and magneto-rotational supernovae predicting different event rates, delay times, and heavy-element yields. Galactic chemical evolution models constrain these properties by comparing model predictions with observed abundances. We explore, in a systematic and data-driven way, the astrophysical conditions under which r-process enrichment can reproduce the observed trends of multiple neutron-capture elements in the Milky Way. Rather than assuming a fixed site, we adopt a flexible, parametric approach to test whether a common set of r-process parameters can explain the chemical evolution of several heavy elements. We compute a grid of one-infall, homogeneous models varying: Eu yield per event, r-process event rate, enrichment delay time, and progenitor mass range. For each of the $\sim 1.5 \times 10^5$ models, we predict [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends by scaling Eu yields with the solar r-process pattern. A multi-objective optimisation based on Pareto fronts identifies models that best reproduce the abundance trends. Best-fitting models favour short delay times ($\leq 30\ \rm Myr$), low-mass progenitors ($\sim 20-25\ \rm M\_\odot$), and an effective Eu injection of $\sim 2 \times 10^{-7}\ \rm M\_\odot$ per event. Stars more massive than $\sim 80\ \rm M\_\odot$ are too rare to dominate the enrichment. While heavy elements can be reproduced, lighter ones show stronger conflicts with Eu, reflecting that the solar r-process scaling relation becomes less valid toward lighter elements. No single class of r-process events, under solar-scaled yields, can explain light and heavy neutron-capture elements; at least two components are required: a main r-process consistent with solar and r-rich stars, and a weaker component producing enhanced light r-process elements, similar to that observed in r-poor stars.

2025-11-17, **Unveiling the nature of the Einstein Probe transient EP 241021a**, J. Quirola-Vásquez et.al., [2511.13314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13314v1)

 We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the fast X-ray transient EP 241021a, discovered by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope aboard the \emph{Einstein Probe} satellite on 2024 October 21. The event was not detected in gamma-rays. Follow-up observations from $\sim$1.5 to 100 days post-trigger were obtained across X-ray, UV, optical, near-infrared, and radio bands with ground- and space-based facilities. The redshift is constrained to $z = 0.7485$ from prominent optical spectral features. The optical light curve shows complex evolution: an initial $\sim t^{-0.7}$ decay, followed by a rapid re-brightening peaking at day 7.7 with $\sim t^{-1.7}$ decay, and a third phase peaking near day 19 with $\sim t^{-1.3}$ decay. The spectral energy distribution (SED) and its temporal evolution are consistent with a mix of non-thermal and thermal components. Early optical-to-X-ray spectral indices agree with optically thin synchrotron emission, while steepening of the optical SED after $\sim$20 days indicates either a shift in emission mechanism or the emergence of an additional component. Although broad-lined absorption features are absent, comparisons with type Ic-BL supernovae suggest a SN contribution at late times, suggesting a collapsar origin for EP 241021a. The likely SN in EP 241021a appears to require an additional energy source beyond $^{56}$Ni decay. These results support the view that some fast X-ray transients detected by the \emph{Einstein Probe} arise from massive stellar explosions.

2025-11-17, **TransFit-CSM: A Fast, Physically Consistent Framework for Interaction-Powered Transients**, Yu-Hao Zhang et.al., [2511.13265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13265v1)

 We present TransFit-CSM, a fast and physically consistent framework for modeling interaction-powered transients. The method self-consistently couples the ejecta circumstellar medium (CSM) shock dynamics to radiative diffusion from a moving heating boundary tied to the shocks, so that both the photon escape path and the effective diffusion time evolve with radius and time. We solve the mass and momentum equations for the forward and reverse shocks together with the diffusion equation in the unshocked CSM. TransFit-CSM reproduces the canonical sequence of an early dark phase, a diffusion-mediated rise and peak, and a post-interaction cooling tail, and it clarifies why Arnett-like peak scalings break down in optically thick CSM. The framework is well suited for Bayesian inference and constrains physical parameters of the ejecta and CSM from bolometric or joint multi-band light curves. Applications to SN 2006gy and SN 2010jl yield accurate fits and physically interpretable posteriors, highlighting the dominant role of pre-supernova mass loss in shaping the observables. Because it is both computationally efficient and physically grounded, TransFit-CSM bridges simple analytic prescriptions and radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, enabling population-level inference for current and future time-domain surveys.

2025-11-17, **SN 2016iog: A fast declining Type II-L supernova with an ultra-faint tail, persistently interacting with circumstellar material**, Z. -H. Peng et.al., [2511.12929v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12929v2)

 We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rapidly declining Type IIL supernova (SN) 2016iog. SN 2016iog reached its peak $\sim$ 14 days after explosion, with an absolute magnitude in the $V$ band of $-18.64 \pm 0.15$ mag, followed by a steep decline of $8.85 \pm 0.15$~mag~(100\,d)$^{-1}$ post-peak. Such a high decline rate makes SN~2016iog one of the fastest declining Type~IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$α$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$α$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN~2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN~2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material.

2025-11-17, **Near-infrared [P II] and [Fe II] line mapping of Galactic supernova remnants**, Takuma Kokusho et.al., [2511.12891v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12891v1)

 Phosphorus (P) is one of the key ingredients for life, yet its origins in galaxies remain poorly understood. In order to investigate the production of P by supernovae, we performed near-infrared (IR) [P II] and [Fe II] line mapping of 26 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) with the Infrared Survey Facility and Kanata telescopes, using the narrow-band filters tuned to these lines. By combining our data with archival [Fe II] maps from UKIRT, we detected both the [P II] and [Fe II] emissions in five SNRs, only the [Fe II] emission in 15 SNRs, and no line emissions in the remaining six. Using the observed [P II]/[Fe II] ratios and upper limits for non-detections, we derived the P/Fe abundance ratios, which vary by up to two orders of magnitude among our sample SNRs. This suggests that the production rate of P and/or the degree of dust destruction may differ from remnant to remnant, the latter being due to the fact that P is volatile while Fe is mostly locked in dust grains. We used the mid- and far-IR maps to examine the dust content for the five SNRs where both the line emissions are detected. As a result, we find that high P/Fe abundance ratios in the northern and southeastern regions of Cassiopeia A and the Crab Nebula, respectively, are not likely due to dust destruction but may reflect an asymmetric ejection of P during supernova explosions. In the Crab Nebula, it is also possible that near-IR [Ni II] emission contaminates the observed flux in the southeastern region, suggesting that the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, rather than the P/Fe abundance ratio, is relatively high in this part of the remnant.
