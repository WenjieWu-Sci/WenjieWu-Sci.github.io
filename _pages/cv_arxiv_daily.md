2023-04-12, **Assisted neutrino pair production in combined external fields**, Naser Ahmadiniaz et.al., [2304.05711v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05711v1)

 Neutrino--antineutrino ($\nu\bar\nu$) pair production is one of the main processes responsible for the energy loss of stars. Apart from the collision of two ($\gamma\gamma\to\nu\bar\nu$) or three ($\gamma\gamma\gamma\to\nu\bar\nu$) real photons, photon decay and photon collisions in the presence of nuclear Coulomb fields or external magnetic fields have been considered previously. Here, we study the low-energy photon decay into a pair of neutrino and antineutrino in the presence of a combined homogeneous magnetic field and the Coulomb field of a nucleus with charge number $Z$.

 The precise determination of the leptonic CP phase is one of the major goals for future generation Long Baseline experiments. On the other hand, if new physics beyond the Standard Model exists, a robust determination of such a CP phase may be a challenge. Moreover, it has been pointed out that, in this scenario, an apparent discrepancy in the CP phase measurement at different experiments may arise. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the determination of the Dirac CP-phase at several long-baseline configurations: ESSnuSB, T2HKK, and a DUNE-like experiment. We use the non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) formalism as a framework. We found that complementary between ESSnuSB and a DUNE-like experiment enhances the robustness in the determination of the CP-phase, even in the presence of matter NSI. Moreover, the T2HKK proposal can help to constrain the matter NSI parameters.

2023-04-11, **Observing Supernova Neutrino Light Curves with Super-Kamiokande. IV. Development of SPECIAL BLEND: a New Public Analysis Code for Supernova Neutrinos**, Akira Harada et.al., [2304.05437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05437v1)

 Supernova neutrinos are invaluable signals that offer information about the interior of supernovae. Because a nearby supernova can occur at any time, preparing for future supernova neutrino observation is an urgent task. For the prompt analysis of supernova neutrinos, we have developed a new analysis code, ``Supernova Parameter Estimation Code based on Insight on Analytic Late-time Burst Light curve at Earth Neutrino Detector (SPECIAL BLEND)''. This code estimates the parameters of supernova based on an analytic model of supernova neutrinos from the proto-neutron star cooling phase. For easy availability to the community, this code is public and easily runs on web environments. SPECIAL BLEND can estimate the parameters better than the analysis pipeline we developed in the previous paper. By using SPECIAL BLEND, we can estimate the supernova parameters within $10\%$ precision up to $\sim 20\,{\rm kpc}$ and $\sim 60\,{\rm kpc}$ (Large Magellanic Cloud contained) with Super Kamiokande and Hyper Kamiokande, respectively.

2023-04-11, **JUNO as a Probe of the Pseudo-Dirac Nature using Solar Neutrinos**, Jack Franklin et.al., [2304.05418v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05418v1)

 It remains a possibility that neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac states, such that a generation is composed of two maximally mixed Majorana neutrinos separated by a very small mass difference. We explore the physics potential of the JUNO experiment in constraining this possibility using the measurement of solar neutrinos. In particular, we investigate cases where one or three sterile states are present in addition to the active states. We consider two scenarios: one where JUNO's energy threshold allows for the measurement of $pp$ solar neutrinos, and the case where JUNO can only measure $^7$Be neutrinos and above. We find that JUNO will be able to constrain pseudo-Dirac mass splittings of $\delta m^2 \gtrsim 2.9\times 10^{-13}~{\rm eV^2}$ for the scenario including $pp$ solar neutrinos, and $\delta m^2 \gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-12}~{\rm eV^2}$ when the measurement only considers $^7$Be monochromatic neutrinos, at the $3\sigma$ C.L. Thus, including $pp$ neutrinos will be crucial for JUNO to improve current constraints on the pseudo-Dirac scenario from solar neutrinos.

2023-04-11, **The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Gravitational Lensing Map and Cosmological Parameters**, Mathew S. Madhavacheril et.al., [2304.05203v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05203v1)

 We present cosmological constraints from a gravitational lensing mass map covering 9400 sq. deg. reconstructed from CMB measurements made by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2017 to 2021. In combination with BAO measurements (from SDSS and 6dF), we obtain the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma\_8 = 0.819 \pm 0.015$ at 1.8% precision, $S\_8\equiv\sigma\_8({\Omega\_{\rm m}}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.840\pm0.028$ and the Hubble constant $H\_0= (68.3 \pm 1.1)\, \text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ at 1.6% precision. A joint constraint with CMB lensing measured by the Planck satellite yields even more precise values: $\sigma\_8 = 0.812 \pm 0.013$, $S\_8\equiv\sigma\_8({\Omega\_{\rm m}}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.831\pm0.023$ and $H\_0= (68.1 \pm 1.0)\, \text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. These measurements agree well with $\Lambda$CDM-model extrapolations from the CMB anisotropies measured by Planck. To compare these constraints to those from the KiDS, DES, and HSC galaxy surveys, we revisit those data sets with a uniform set of assumptions, and find $S\_8$ from all three surveys are lower than that from ACT+Planck lensing by varying levels ranging from 1.7-2.1$\sigma$. These results motivate further measurements and comparison, not just between the CMB anisotropies and galaxy lensing, but also between CMB lensing probing $z\sim 0.5-5$ on mostly-linear scales and galaxy lensing at $z\sim 0.5$ on smaller scales. We combine our CMB lensing measurements with CMB anisotropies to constrain extensions of $\Lambda$CDM, limiting the sum of the neutrino masses to $\sum m\_{\nu} < 0.12$ eV (95% c.l.), for example. Our results provide independent confirmation that the universe is spatially flat, conforms with general relativity, and is described remarkably well by the $\Lambda$CDM model, while paving a promising path for neutrino physics with gravitational lensing from upcoming ground-based CMB surveys.

2023-04-11, **Characterizing quasi-steady states of fast neutrino-flavor conversion by stability and conservation laws**, Masamichi Zaizen et.al., [2304.05044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05044v1)

 The question of what ingredients characterize the quasi-steady state of fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC) is one of the long-standing riddles in neutrino oscillation. Addressing this issue is necessary for accurate modeling of neutrino transport in core-collapse supernova and binary neutron star merger. Recent numerical simulations of FFC have shown, however, that the quasi-steady state is sensitively dependent on boundary conditions in space, and the physical reason for the dependence is not clear at present. In this study, we provide a physical interpretation of this issue based on arguments with stability and conservation laws. The stability can be determined by the disappearance of ELN(electron neutrino-lepton number)-XLN(heavy-leptonic one) angular crossings, and we also highlight two conserved quantities characterizing the quasi-steady state of FFC: (1) lepton number conservation along each neutrino trajectory and (2) conservation law associated with angular moments, depending on boundary conditions, for each flavor of neutrinos. We demonstrate that neutrino distributions in quasi-steady states can be determined in an analytic way regardless of boundary conditions, which are in good agreement with numerical simulations. This study represents a major step forward a unified picture determining asymptotic states of FFCs.

2023-04-11, **ZnO-based scintillating bolometers: New prospects to study double beta decay of $^{64}$Zn**, A. Armatol et.al., [2304.05043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05043v1)

 The first detailed study on the performance of a ZnO-based cryogenic scintillating bolometer as a detector to search for rare processes in zinc isotopes was performed. A 7.2 g ZnO low-temperature detector, containing more than 80\% of zinc in its mass, exhibits good energy resolution of baseline noise 1.0--2.7 keV FWHM at various working temperatures resulting in a low-energy threshold for the experiment, 2.0--6.0 keV. The light yield for $\beta$/$\gamma$ events was measured as 1.5(3) keV/MeV, while it varies for $\alpha$ particles in the range of 0.2--3.0 keV/MeV. The detector demonstrate an effective identification of the $\beta$/$\gamma$ events from $\alpha$ events using time-properties of only heat signals. %(namely, Rise time parameter). The radiopurity of the ZnO crystal was evaluated using the Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, an ultra-low-background High Purity Ge $\gamma$-spectrometer, and bolometric measurements. Only limits were set at the level of $\mathcal{O}$(1--100) mBq/kg on activities of \Nuc{K}{40}, \Nuc{Cs}{137} and daughter nuclides from the U/Th natural decay chains. The total internal $\alpha$-activity was calculated to be 22(2) mBq/kg, with a major contribution caused by 6(1) mBq/kg of \Nuc{Th}{232} and 12(2) mBq/kg of \Nuc{U}{234}. Limits on double beta decay (DBD) processes in \Nuc{Zn}{64} and \Nuc{Zn}{70} isotopes were set on the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{17}$--$10^{18})$ yr for various decay modes profiting from 271 h of acquired background data in the above-ground lab. This study shows a good potential for ZnO-based scintillating bolometers to search for DBD processes of Zn isotopes, especially in \Nuc{Zn}{64}, with the most prominent spectral features at $\sim$10--20 keV, like the two neutrino double electron capture. A 10 kg-scale experiment can reach the experimental sensitivity at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{24})$ yr.

2023-04-11, **CKM and PMNS mixing matrix from $SO(2)$ flavor symmetry**, Guojun Xu et.al., [2304.05017v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05017v1)

 The relation between quark masses and CKM mixing is studied based on an approximate chiral $SO(2)\_L\times SO(2)\_R$ flavor symmetry of quark mass matrix. In mass hierarchy limit, the mass ratio effect to CKM mixing is suppressed, which separates mass hierarchy and quark flavor mixing into two independent problems. We show that CKM mixing is dominated by two left-handed $SO(2)\_L^{u,d}$ symmetry while mass hierarchy only provides slight corrections. The same mixing structure is generalized to lepton sector with extended Dirac neutrinos. The common flavor mixing provides a novel comprehension on the relation between quark CKM mixing and lepton PMNS mixing.

2023-04-12, **Self-resonant Dark Matter**, Hyun Min Lee et.al., [2304.05942v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05942v1)

 We present a review on the self-resonant dark matter scenarios where multiple components of dark matter give rise to a resonant condition in the $u$-channel diagrams for their comparable masses. In this case, there is no need of lighter mediators for enhancing the self-scattering and annihilation cross sections for dark matter. We discuss the velocity-dependent self-scattering for the small-scale problems, the relic density of self-resonant dark matter, and the observable signatures in indirect and detection experiments.

2023-04-12, **Impact of dark matter spikes on the merger rates of Primordial Black Holes**, Pratibha Jangra et.al., [2304.05892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05892v1)

 Mergers of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may contribute to the gravitational wave mergers detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. We study the dynamics of PBH binaries dressed with dark matter (DM) spikes, for PBHs with extended mass functions. We analyze the impact of DM spikes on the orbital parameters of the PBH binaries formed in the early Universe and calculate their merger rates at the age of the Universe today. We consider two possible scenarios for the dynamics of the dressed binaries: assuming that either the DM spikes are completely evaporated from the binaries before merger or they remain static until the merger. Contrary to previous studies, we find that the presence of spikes may increase or decrease the present-day PBH merger rates, in some cases dramatically. Comparing with merger rates reported by the LVK Collaboration in the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3), we derive approximate constraints on the fraction of Solar-mass PBHs in cold dark matter as $f\_\mathrm{pbh}\leq \mathcal{O}(10^{-5} - 10^{-3})$, depending on the mass function. Our calculations are valid only for the idealized scenarios in which the DM spikes are either evaporated or static. However, they suggest that the impact of DM spikes on PBH merger rates may be more complicated than previously thought and motivate the development of a more general description of the merger dynamics, including feedback of the DM spikes in highly eccentric PBH binaries.

2023-04-12, **Lensing with generalized symmetrons**, Christian Käding et.al., [2304.05875v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05875v1)

 Generalized symmetrons are models that have qualitatively similar features to the archetypal symmetron, but have barely been studied. In this article, we investigate for what parameter values the fifth forces induced by disformally coupling generalized symmetrons can provide an explanation for the difference between baryonic and lens masses of galaxies. While it is known that the standard symmetron struggles with providing an alternative source for the lensing otherwise attributed to particle dark matter, we show that some generalized symmetron models are more suitable for complying with existing constraints on disformal couplings. This motivates future studies of these only little explored models.

2023-04-12, **Detecting axion dark matter with Rydberg atoms via induced electric dipole transitions**, Georg Engelhardt et.al., [2304.05863v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05863v1)

 Long-standing efforts to detect axions are driven by two compelling prospects, naturally accounting for the absence of charge-conjugation and parity symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics, and for the elusive dark matter at ultralight mass scale. Many experiments use the axion-photon coupling to probe the magnetic-field-mediated conversion of axions to photons. Here, we show that axion matter in a magnetic field induces electric dipole transitions in atoms and molecules. When applied to Rydberg atoms, which feature particularly large transition dipole elements, this effect promises an outstanding sensitivity for detecting ultralight dark matter. Our estimates show that it outperforms current experiments and other theoretical approaches based on axion-photon conversion by several orders of magnitude. The Rydberg atomic gases offer a flexible and inexpensive experimental platform that can operate at room temperature. We project the sensitivity by quantizing the axion-modified Maxwell equations to accurately describe atoms and molecules as quantum sensors wherever axion dark matter is present.

2023-04-12, **New Deformed Heisenberg Algebra from the $μ$-Deformed Model of Dark Matter**, A. M. Gavrilik et.al., [2304.05840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05840v1)

 Recently, the $\mu$-deformation-based approach to modeling dark matter, which exploits $\mu$-deformed thermodynamics, was extended to the study of galaxy halo density profile and of the rotation curves of a number of (dwarf or low brightness) galaxies. For that goal, $\mu$-deformed analogs of the Lane--Emden equation (LEE) have been proposed, and their solutions describing density profiles obtained. There are two seemingly different versions of $\mu$-deformed LEE which possess the same solution, and so we deal with their equivalence. From the latter property we derive new, rather unusual, $\mu$-deformed Heisenberg algebra (HA) for the position and momentum operators, and present the $\mu$-HA in few possible forms (each one at $\mu\to0$ recovers usual HA). The generalized uncertainty relation linked with the new $\mu$-HA is studied, along with its interesting implications including the appearance of the quadruple of both maximal and minimal lengths and momenta.

2023-04-12, **Fuzzy dark matter confronts rotation curves of nearby dwarf irregular galaxies**, Andrés Bañares-Hernández et.al., [2304.05793v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05793v1)

 We investigate phenomenologically the viability of fuzzy dark matter (FDM). We do this by confronting the predictions of the model, in particular the formation of a solitonic core at the centre of dark matter haloes, with a homogeneous and robust sample of high-resolution rotation curves from the ``LITTLE THINGS in 3D'' catalog. This comprises a collection of isolated, dark matter dominated dwarf-irregular galaxies that provides an optimal benchmark for cosmological studies. We use a statistical framework based on Markov-Chain Monte Carlo techniques that allows us to extract relevant parameters such as the axion mass, the mass of the solitonic core, the mass of the dark matter halo and its concentration parameter with a rather loose set of priors except for the implementation of a core-halo relation that is predicted by simulations. The results of the fits are used to perform various diagnostics on the predictions of the model. FDM provides an excellent fit to the rotation curves of the ``LITTLE THINGS in 3D'' catalog, with axion masses determined from different galaxies clustering around $m\_a\approx2\times10^{-23}$ eV. However we find two major problems in our analysis. First, the data follow scaling relations of the properties of the core which are not consistent with the predictions of the soliton. This problem is particularly acute in the core radius - mass relation with a tension that, at face value, has a significance $\gtrsim5\sigma$. The second problem is related to the strong suppression of the linear power spectrum that is predicted by FDM for the axion mass preferred by the data. This can be constrained very conservatively by the galaxy counts in our sample, which leads to a tension exceeding again $5\sigma$. We estimate the effects of baryons in our analysis and discuss whether they could alleviate the tensions of the model with observations.

2023-04-11, **Hidden Supersymmetric Dark Sectors**, Giacomo Cacciapaglia et.al., [2304.05431v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05431v1)

 The attractive feature of supersymmetry is predictive power, due to the large number of calculable properties and to coupling non-renormalisation. This power can be fully expressed in hidden sectors where supersymmetry may be exact, as these sectors are secluded from the visible one where instead supersymmetry must be broken. This suggests a new paradigm for supersymmetric dark sectors, where supersymmetry is exact at the dark matter scale, implying that many properties of hidden supersymmetric dark sectors can be fully computed. As a proof of concept we discuss a concrete example based on $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills.

2023-04-11, **Detector signal characterization with a Bayesian network in XENONnT**, XENON Collaboration et.al., [2304.05428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05428v1)

 We developed a detector signal characterization model based on a Bayesian network trained on the waveform attributes generated by a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. By performing inference on the model, we produced a quantitative metric of signal characterization and demonstrate that this metric can be used to determine whether a detector signal is sourced from a scintillation or an ionization process. We describe the method and its performance on electronic-recoil (ER) data taken during the first science run of the XENONnT dark matter experiment. We demonstrate the first use of a Bayesian network in a waveform-based analysis of detector signals. This method resulted in a 3% increase in ER event selection efficiency with a simultaneously effective rejection of events outside of the region of interest. The findings of this analysis are consistent with the previous analysis from XENONnT, namely a background-only fit of the ER data.

2023-04-11, **Non-relativistic limit for Higher Spin Fields and Planar Schroedinger Equation in 3D**, Abhijeet Dutta et.al., [2304.05321v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05321v1)

 Higher spin (HS) fields naturally occur in string theory, they are considered as a candidate for dark matter and may also appear as a collective excitation in condensed matter systems. In some cases one may study the HS fields in the non-relativistic settings. Thus, it is of interest to know the non-relativistic limit of HS fields and how to find the Schroedinger equation as the dynamical equation in this limit. In this paper, we consider the non-relativistic limit of HS fields in Minkowskian spacetime in 3D. We work both at the level of equation of motion and action/Lagrangian density. We find the systematic procedures in both settings and show that they can be generalized to arbitrary HS fields.

2023-04-11, **Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory: Quasistatic spherical solutions and their phenomenology**, Peter Verwayen et.al., [2304.05134v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05134v1)

 There have been many efforts in the last three decades to embed the empirical MOND program into a robust theoretical framework. While many such theories can explain the profile of galactic rotation curves, they usually cannot explain the evolution 15 the primordial fluctuations and the formation of large-scale-structures in the Universe. The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory seems to have overcome this difficulty, thereby providing the first compelling example of an extension of general relativity able to successfully challenge the particle dark matter hypothesis. Here we study the phenomenology of this theory in the quasistatic weak-field regime and specifically for the idealised case of spherical isolated sources.   We find the existence of three distinct gravitational regimes, that is, Newtonian, MOND and a third regime characterised by the presence of oscillations in the gravitational potential which do not exist in the traditional MOND paradigm. We identify the transition scales between these three regimes and discuss their dependence on the boundary conditions and other parameters in the theory. Aided by analytical and numerical solutions, we explore the dependence of these solutions on the theory parameters. Our results could help in searching for interesting observable phenomena at low redshift pertaining to galaxy dynamics as well as lensing observations, however, this may warrant proper N-body simulations that go beyond the idealised case of spherical isolated sources.

2023-04-11, **Investigating Dark Matter-Admixed Neutron Stars with NITR Equation of State in Light of PSR J0952-0607**, Pinku Routaray et.al., [2304.05100v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05100v1)

 The heaviest pulsar, PSR J0952-0607, with a mass of $M=2.35\pm0.17 \ M\_\odot$, has recently been discovered in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy. In response to this discovery, a new RMF model, "NITR" has been developed. The NITR model's naturalness has been confirmed by assessing its validity for various finite nuclei and nuclear matter (NM) properties, including incompressibility, symmetry energy, and slope parameter values of 225.11, 31.69, and 43.86 MeV, respectively. These values satisfy the empirical/experimental limits currently available. The maximum mass and canonical radius of a neutron star (NS) calculated using the NITR model parameters are 2.35 $M\_\odot$ and 12.73 km, respectively, which fall within the range of PSR J0952-0607 and the latest NICER limit. This study aims to test the NITR model consistency by applying it to different systems and, consequently, calibrate its validity extensively. Subsequently, the NITR model equation of state (EOS) is employed to obtain the properties of a dark matter admixed neutron star using two approaches: non-gravitational (single fluid) and two-fluid. In the two-fluid model, the dark matter (DM) particles only interact with each other via gravity rather than the nucleons. In both cases, the equation of state becomes softer due to DM interactions, which reduces various macroscopic properties such as maximum mass, radius, tidal deformability, etc. Additionally, through the use of various observational data, efforts are made to constraint the quantity of DM within the NS.

2023-04-11, **Future Constraints on Dark Matter with Gravitationally Lensed Fast Radio Bursts Detected by BURSTT**, Simon C. -C. Ho et.al., [2304.04990v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04990v1)

 Understanding dark matter is one of the most urgent questions in modern physics. A very interesting candidate is primordial black holes (PBHs; Carr2016). For the mass ranges of $< 10^{-16} M\_{\odot}$ and $> 100 M\_{\odot}$, PBHs have been ruled out. However, they are still poorly constrained in the mass ranges of $10^{-16} - 100 M\_{\odot}$ (Belotsky et al. 2019). Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond flashes of radio light of unknown origin mostly from outside the Milky Way. Due to their short timescales, gravitationally lensed FRBs, which are yet to be detected, have been proposed as a useful probe for constraining the presence of PBHs in the mass window of $< 100M\_{\odot}$ (Mu\~noz et al. 2016). Up to now, the most successful project in finding FRBs has been CHIME. Due to its large field of view (FoV), CHIME is detecting at least 600 FRBs since 2018. However, none of them is confirmed to be gravitationally lensed (Leung et al. 2022). Taiwan plans to build a new telescope, BURSTT dedicated to detecting FRBs. Its survey area will be 25 times greater than CHIME. BURSTT can localize all of these FRBs through very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We estimate the probability to find gravitationally lensed FRBs, based on the scaled redshift distribution from the latest CHIME catalog and the lensing probability function from Mu\~noz et al. (2016). BURSTT-2048 can detect ~ 24 lensed FRBs out of ~ 1,700 FRBs per annum. With BURSTT's ability to detect nanosecond FRBs, we can constrain PBHs to form a part of dark matter down to $10^{-4}M\_{\odot}$.

2023-04-12, **Accretion process of a black hole in scalar field dark energy model**, M. Koussour et.al., [2304.05807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05807v1)

 We propose a logarithmic parametrization form of energy density for the scalar field dark energy in the framework of the standard theory of gravity, which supports the necessary transition from the decelerated to the accelerated periods of the Universe. The analyzed model has a parameter space that is constrained by available observational data, including cosmic chronometers data-sets (CC), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data-sets, and Supernovae (SN) data-sets, consisting of only two parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The combined $CC$+$BAO$+$SN$ data-sets yields a transition redshift of $z\_{tr}=0.79^{+0.02}\_{-0.02}$, where the model exhibits signature-flipping and is consistent with recent observations. For the combined data-sets, the present value of the deceleration parameter is calculated to be $q\_{0}=-0.43^{+0.06}\_{-0.06}$. Furthermore, the analysis yields constraints on both the parameter density value for matter and the present value of the Hubble parameter, with values of $\Omega\_{m0}=0.25849^{+0.00026}\_{-0.00025}$ and $H\_{0}=67.79\_{-0.59}^{+0.59}km/s/Mpc$, respectively, consistent with the results obtained from Planck 2018. Finally, the study investigates how the mass of a black hole evolves over time in a Universe with both matter and dark energy. It reveals that the black hole mass increases initially but stops increasing as dark energy dominates.

2023-04-12, **The neutron star to black hole mass gap in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM)**, Noam Soker et.al., [2304.05705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05705v1)

 I build a toy model in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) that incorporates both the stochastically varying angular momentum component of the material that the newly born neutron star (NS) accretes and the constant angular momentum component and show that the JJEM can account for the ~2.5-5Mo mass gap between NSs and black holes (BHs). The random component of the angular momentum results from pre-collapse core convection fluctuations that are amplified by post-collapse instabilities. The fixed angular momentum component results from pre-collapse core rotation. For slowly rotating pre-collapse cores the stochastic angular momentum fluctuations form intermittent accretion disks (or belts) around the NS with varying angular momentum axes in all directions. The intermittent accretion disk/belt launches jets in all directions that expel the core material in all directions early on, hence leaving a NS remnant. Rapidly rotating pre-collapse cores form an accretion disk with angular momentum axis that is about the same as the pre-collapse core rotation. The NS launches jets along this axis and hence the jets avoid the equatorial plane region. In-flowing core material continues to feed the central object from the equatorial plane increasing the NS mass to form a BH. The narrow transition from slow to rapid pre-collapse core rotation, i.e., from an efficient to inefficient jet feedback mechanism, accounts for the sparsely populated mass gap.

 GN-z11 is an unusually luminous high redshift galaxy which was recently observed to have strong nitrogen lines while at the same time lacking traditional signatures of AGN activity. These observations have been interpreted as a super-solar nitrogen abundance which is challenging to explain with standard stellar evolution and supernovae enrichment. We present simulations of four models of metal enriched supermassive stars after the zero age main sequence which produce super-solar nitrogen consistent with the observations of GN-z11. We then show that the most massive model ends its life in a violent explosion which results in even greater nitrogen pollution.

 We analyzed All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations of CM Mic and found that this object belongs to a small group of ER UMa stars showing standstills. In addition to typical ER UMa-type cycles, the object showed standstills between 2017 and 2019 July, and in 2022. The supercycles varied between 49 and 83 d. In 2015, the object showed outbursts with a cycle length of ~35 d. An analysis of TESS observations during the 2020 July outburst detected superhumps with a mean period of 0.080251(6) d (value after the full development of superhumps). We also studied other ER UMa stars showing standstills mainly using Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data. DDE 48, MGAB-V728 and ZTF18abmpkbj mostly showed ER UMa-type supercycles but showed one or two standstills. MGAB-V3488 was mostly in ER UMa states with short (~25 d) supercycles in 2020-2022 similar to RZ LMi. This object also showed long standstills. PS1-3PI J181732.65+101954.6 showed ER UMa-type supercycles up to 2020 May and entered a long standstill. ZTF18abncpgs showed standstills most of the time, but also showed ER UMa-type supercycles occasionally between standstills. ZTF19aarsljl is a likely member of this group. MGAB-V284 showed a pattern similar to ER UMa stars showing standstills but with a longer time-scale of normal outbursts. This object seems to be an ER UMa star with standstills above the period gap. None of the objects we studied showed a superoutburst arising from a long standstill, as recorded in NY Ser in 2018, although the 2019 June-July superoutburst of PS1-3PI J181732.65+101954.6 might have been an exception.
