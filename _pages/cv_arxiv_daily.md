2025-09-24, **Directly Probing Neutrino Interactions through CMB Phase Shift Measurements**, Gabriele Montefalcone et.al., [2509.20363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20363v1)

 Perturbations in the cosmic neutrino background produce a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations imprinted in the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), providing a unique observational probe of neutrino physics. In this work, we explore how this phase shift signature is altered in the presence of neutrino interactions with temperature-dependent scattering rates, motivated by physical constructions for neutrino self-interactions and neutrino-dark matter couplings. A key finding is that the phase shift in these realistic models -- characterized by gradual rather than instantaneous decoupling -- maintains the same functional form as the free-streaming template, with only the asymptotic amplitude decreasing for stronger interactions that delay decoupling. This simple parametrization enables us to directly constrain neutrino interactions through phase shift measurements in the temperature and polarization power spectra from CMB observations. Analyzing the latest data from \textit{Planck}, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, we derive strong constraints on the neutrino decoupling redshift. Our global analysis indicates that neutrinos have been freely streaming since deep within the radiation-dominated epoch. We also explore flavor-dependent scenarios in which only one neutrino species interacts. Overall, our work establishes a signature-driven framework that exploits the clean phase shift signal in the acoustic oscillations of the CMB as a precise and robust probe of non-standard neutrino interactions in the early universe.

2025-09-24, **Probing Beyond the Standard Model Scenarios in Long-baseline and Astrophysical Neutrino Experiments**, Sudipta Das et.al., [2509.20348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20348v1)

 Over the past few decades, outstanding progress in the neutrino experiment frontier has greatly advanced our understanding of the flavor oscillations of active neutrinos. The remaining key questions such as the neutrino mass ordering, the presence of CP violation in the lepton sector, and the octant of $\theta\_{23}$ are expected to be resolved in the coming years. The current precise knowledge of neutrino mass and mixing parameters, together with the promising prospects of next-generation neutrino experiments, provides a unique opportunity to test scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) through neutrino oscillation phenomena. This thesis investigates several such BSM scenarios and examines the capability of the next-generation neutrino experiments to probe them.

2025-09-24, **Effect of Cosmic Neutrino Background on the Dark Matter Self-interaction via Neutrino force**, Pawin Ittisamai et.al., [2509.20170v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20170v1)

 Neutrino-pair exchange induces a neutrino force that can drive dark matter (DM) self-interactions and impact small-scale structure formation. In the presence of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), this force can be modified, with important consequences for DM phenomenology. We study the effect of the C$\nu$B on neutrino forces, generated by the scalar and pseudoscalar interactions. We explore the significance of the background neutrino force on the scalar DM-neutrino portal model, including DM self-scattering and annihilation. Our results show that the interplay between attractive vacuum potential and repulsive background potential leads to a screening effect that varies across DM mass ($m\_\chi$) regimes, strongly affecting DM self-scattering in the DM mass $m\_\nu \lesssim m\_\chi \lesssim T\_{C \nu B}$. By contrast, the impact on DM annihilation is negligible. Overall, the C$\nu$B substantially reshapes the viable coupling range for DM self-interactions while remaining compatible with current constraints, offering a pathway to small-scale structure problems.

2025-09-24, **Studies on Response Uniformity of RPC and Exploring Oscillation Dip and Valley, Non-Standard Interactions, and Earth's Core using Atmospheric Neutrinos at ICAL-INO detector**, Anil Kumar et.al., [2509.20094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20094v1)

 In this thesis, experimental and physics simulation studies are performed in the context of the proposed 50 kt Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). ICAL would detect atmospheric muon neutrinos and antineutrinos separately in the multi-GeV range of energies over a wide range of baselines. In the experimental part of the thesis, the effect of the non-uniformity of the graphite layer on the detector response of the resistive plate chamber is studied. In the physics simulation part, it is demonstrated for the first time that the neutrino oscillation dip and valley can be observed at ICAL using the up/down ratio of reconstructed muons and antimuons separately. A method is formulated such that the location of the dip and the alignment of the valley can be used to measure an atmospheric oscillation parameter called the mass-squared difference. Further, a new approach is proposed to probe the neutral-current non-standard interactions (NSIs) using the oscillation dip and valley. The opposite shifts in the oscillation dips and the contrast in the curvatures of oscillation valleys for reconstructed muons and antimuons are used to constrain the NSI parameter in two separate ways. While passing through the Earth, the upward-going atmospheric neutrinos experience the matter effects, which modify the neutrino oscillation patterns. These matter effects depend upon the density of electrons inside Earth and can be used to perform the neutrino oscillation tomography of Earth, complementary to gravitational measurements and seismic studies. This work demonstrates that the presence of Earth's core can be validated using the atmospheric neutrinos at ICAL.

2025-09-24, **Jet-driven explosion of an accretion-induced white-dwarf collapse via a magnetorotational dynamo**, Luciano Combi et.al., [2509.19799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19799v1)

 The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a rotating white dwarf (WD) offers a potential site of millisecond pulsars/magnetars, gamma-ray bursts, and r-process nucleosynthesis. We present three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including neutrinos of magnetorotational AIC, assuming the WD is rapidly spinning with a weak magnetic field confined below its surface (likely a prerequisite for rapid rotation). Within milliseconds after core bounce, the magnetic field is exponentially amplified near the surface of the proto-neutron star (PNS). We witness the emergence of a small-scale turbulent and mean-field, large-scale MRI-driven dynamo in the neutrino-cooled centrifugally supported disk formed around the PNS, which generates bundles of large-scale toroidal field with alternating polarity. The amplified field becomes buoyant and is advected above the PNS, generating a magnetic tower that drives a mildly relativistic striped jet. The jet breaks out of the WD, clearing the way for a powerful magnetized neutron-rich wind from the disk. Although our simulation cannot follow the long-term Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase of the PNS, the conditions are ripe for the formation of a GRB powered by magnetar spin-down. A similar dynamo may operate in magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers.

2025-09-23, **Connecting cosmologically decaying dark matter to neutrino physics**, Lea Fu√ü et.al., [2509.19596v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19596v1)

 Dark matter decays into invisible particles can leave an imprint in large-scale structure surveys due to a characteristic redshift-dependent suppression of the power spectrum. We present a model with two quasi-degenerate singlet fermions, $\chi\_1$ and $\chi\_2$, in which the heavier state decays as $\chi\_2 \to \bar \chi\_1 \nu \nu$ on cosmological time-scales, and that also accommodates non-zero neutrino masses. Remarkably, for parameters that yield the correct dark matter abundance via freeze-in and reproduce the observed neutrino masses, dark matter decay can produce detectable signals in forthcoming large-scale structure surveys, a diffuse anti-neutrino flux accessible to JUNO, and a gamma-ray line within the energy range probed by COSI. Both the cosmological lifetime of $\chi\_2$ as well as the small (radiatively induced) mass splitting among $\chi\_{1,2}$ are a natural consequence of the mechanism of neutrino mass generation within this model. This highlights the potential role of large-scale structure surveys in probing some classes of neutrino mass models.

2025-09-23, **Modeling of Dark Matter Prompt and Secondary Signatures in Dwarf Galaxies**, Athithya Aravinthan et.al., [2509.19458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19458v1)

 Dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are very promising laboratories for the indirect search for dark matter (DM), due to their low astrophysical background in radio and gamma-ray frequencies. This is convenient when considering Weakly Interacting Dark Matter (WIMP) that can annihilate and produce radio continuum emission. Radio detections of dSph galaxies, however, prove to be difficult and motivate the consideration of transient galaxies that have just recently become quiescent.   For the past several decades, the prompt emission from DM annihilation signatures has been explored through modeling and the setting of limits. In addition to the prompt annihilation signatures from neutrinos, gamma-rays, electrons, positrons, and antimatter, the secondary emission from charged annihilation products undergoing radiative loss processes also contributes to the picture. For instance, synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering of charged products such as electrons and positrons can provide a significant signal. The quantitative modeling of this secondary emission with the astrophysical background is necessary to place stringent constraints on the nature of DM.   In this work, the multi-wavelength secondary spectrum of DM annihilation for a dwarf galaxy is calculated using the open-source code CRPropa 3.2, which enables the self-consistent treatment of the astrophysical background and secondary emissions. We present a systematic comparison of signatures from conventional astrophysical processes to those expected from DM annihilation. The morphological differences between the two scenarios are investigated. Tests of the impact of different magnetic fields, DM masses, and DM profiles will be performed in the next steps.

2025-09-23, **A sterile-neutrino search using data from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber performed in an undergraduate teaching laboratory**, John Waiton et.al., [2509.18859v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18859v1)

 Fundamental particle physics is a key part of an undergraduate physics curriculum, but can be challenging to incorporate into teaching laboratories. We present an undergraduate laboratory experiment that enables students to work with real data from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber to search for the existence of a sterile neutrino: a new, fourth, neutrino state. This search has galvanized physicists for decades, as the existence of sterile neutrinos could play a critical role in understanding fundamental processes in the early universe, provide viable dark matter candidates, and offer a natural explanation for the origin of neutrino masses. From an experimental point of view, anomalies observed in several neutrino experiments provide tantalizing hints of their existence. The analysis presented here, whilst based on real data, has been adapted as a pedagogical tool for an undergraduate teaching laboratory, in which students are asked to develop an understanding of neutrino oscillation theory, analyse a MicroBooNE data sample, and apply statistical methods to search for a potential sterile neutrino. The analysis incorporates machine learning techniques to improve event classification. Students are encouraged to explore these and other methods to optimize their results.

2025-09-23, **On Massive Neutrinos and Coherence in Neutrino Oscillations**, Anca Tureanu et.al., [2509.18812v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18812v1)

 We examine the central tenet of the current standard theory of neutrino oscillations, namely the assumption that neutrinos are emitted and detected as flavour neutrino states, which are coherent superpositions of massive neutrino states of different masses. We prove that all the quantum mechanical and quantum field theoretical arguments, including the invocation of the uncertainty principle and the wave packet description of massive neutrinos, entail the production of neutrinos as statistical ensembles of massive neutrino states. As the states in a statistical ensemble do not interfere, neutrino oscillations cannot be explained by the superposition of massive states. We point out that neutrino oscillations in vacuum can be consistently formulated in theories which include, among other assumptions, the premise that the asymptotic states are massless flavour neutrinos.

2025-09-23, **Assessing the operating characteristics of an ion-milled phonon-mediated quantum parity detector**, Brandon J. Sandoval et.al., [2509.18637v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18637v1)

 Phonon sensitive superconducting qubits promise to provide sub-eV energy deposit thresholds, useful for future rare-event experiments looking for interactions from dark matter and neutrinos. We detail here engineering results from a Quantum Parity Detector (QPDs), one of a class of phonon sensitive qubits, and, as a first measurement, show that this device has a quiescent quasiparticle density of $1.8 \pm 0.8 \mu \mathrm{m}^{-3}$, in line with expectation. We also outline an argon ion-mill process for multi-step Josephson Junction fabrication, expanding the sparse literature on this topic, which proves useful in avoiding secondary parasitic junctions.

2025-09-23, **Exploring the Fundamental Properties of Neutrino from Oscillation Experiments**, Masoom Singh et.al., [2509.18623v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18623v1)

 As physicists pursue precision neutrino measurements, complementary experiments covering varied oscillation landscapes have become essential for resolving current tensions in global fits. This thesis presents projected sensitivities and forecasted performance of two next-generation long-baseline experiments: DUNE and T2HK, through detailed simulations addressing fundamental questions including neutrino mass ordering, leptonic CP violation, and the octant of $\theta\_{23}$. We demonstrate through simulated analyses that while each experiment alone faces inherent degeneracies, their complementary features enable breakthrough projected sensitivities in both standard oscillation parameter measurements and forecasted searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The combined simulation results reveal that DUNE-T2HK synergy will be crucial for achieving a comprehensive understanding of neutrino properties in the coming decade.

2025-09-24, **Dark Matter and Electroweak Baryogenesis with Spontaneous $CP$ Violation in the Early Universe**, Subhojit Roy et.al., [2509.19982v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19982v1)

 Dark matter (DM) and the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) are among the most compelling indications of physics beyond the Standard Model. We revisit the inelastic Higgs-portal complex singlet, a minimal framework in which a complex scalar splits into two nearly degenerate real states, with an off-diagonal Higgs-portal interaction that drives coannihilation to set the relic density, while the elastic DM-Higgs coupling can be tuned small enough to evade direct-detection limits. This setup naturally supports a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) and can account for the long-standing Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) via present-day DM annihilation into Higgs pairs. In this work, we show that the same framework, extended by a $Z\_2$-symmetric dimension-6 $CP$-violating top Yukawa operator, can also generate the BAU via the electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) mechanism. The cosmological history involves a two-step electroweak phase transition: first, the singlet fields acquire nonzero vacuum expectation values (vevs); then a strongly first-order transition occurs in which the Higgs develops its nonzero vev while the singlet vevs vanish. During this second step, both fields remain nonzero only within the advancing bubble wall, generating wall-localized $CP$ violation that biases sphaleron transitions and enables EWBG. After the phase transition, $CP$ and $Z\_2$ symmetries are restored: the lightest singlet state becomes a stable DM candidate, while the vanishing singlet vevs allow the model to naturally satisfy the stringent constraints on $CP$ violation. We delineate the SFOEWPT-favored parameter space, identifying the criteria for the two-step phase transition region that simultaneously yields the observed BAU and relic density, explains the GCE, and predicts gravitational wave spectra accessible to next-generation space-based detectors.

2025-09-24, **Abnormal dense and dilute nuclear systems**, E. E. Kolomeitsev et.al., [2509.19848v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19848v1)

 Researchers have long been interested in exotic states of matter. In the early 1970s, Migdal proposed the existence of metastable or stable nuclei containing a pion condensate, and Bodmer posited the existence of collapsed nuclei with a quark core. Lee and Wick proposed that compressed nuclear matter could undergo a phase transition into a scalar condensate state with effectively very light baryons. In the mid-1980s, Witten pointed out that strange quark matter may be an absolutely stable form of matter that can exist in the form of quark strangelets. These hypotheses stimulated large experimental efforts to detect these states in heavy-ion collisions and in terrestrial samples. Additionally, the cosmos is the arena for a broad search for traces of exotic matter in compact objects and other energetic phenomena. We review various approaches and arguments for the possibility of abnormal states of matter, including metastable and stable dense objects with condensates, as well as dilute nuclear objects. Among these, we discuss scalar condensate and p-wave and s-wave pion condensations in dense nuclear systems and the formation of a $\Delta$ resonance matter. Then we consider a scalar mode condensation triggered by the Pomeranchuk instability in dilute nuclear matter, and clustering. We also mention recent ideas that a relativistic rotation and a dark-matter component may stabilize abnormal nuclear systems. Finally, we list some observational anomalies that cannot yet be appropriately explained by conventional physics.

2025-09-24, **DARKSKIES: A suite of super-sampled zoom-in simulations of galaxy clusters with self-interacting dark matter**, David Harvey et.al., [2509.19842v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19842v1)

 We present the "DARKSKIES" suite of one hundred, zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of massive ($M\_{200}>5\times10^{14}{\rm M}\_\odot)$ galaxy clusters with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We super-sample the simulations such that $m\_{\rm DM}/m\_{\rm gas}\sim0.1$, enabling us to simulate a dark matter particle mass of $m=0.68\times10^{8}M\_\odot$ an order of magnitude faster, whilst exploring SIDM in the core of clusters at extremely high resolution. We calibrate the baryonic feedback to produce observationally consistent and realistic galaxy clusters across all simulations and simulate five models of velocity-independent SIDM targeting the expected sensitivity of future telescopes - $\sigma\_{\rm DM}/m=0.,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$ cm$^2$/g. We find the density profiles exhibit the characteristic core even in the smallest of cross-sections, with cores developing only at late times ($z<0.5$). We investigate the dynamics of the brightest cluster galaxy inside the dark matter halo and find in SIDM cosmologies there exists a so-called wobbling not observed in collisionless dark matter. We find this wobble is driven by accreting mass on to a cored density profile with the signal peaking at $z=0.25$ and dropping thereafter. This finding is further supported by the existence of an anti-correlation between the offset between the BCG and the dark matter halo and its relative velocity in SIDM only, a hallmark of harmonic oscillation.

2025-09-23, **Nulling baryonic feedback in weak lensing surveys using cross-correlations with fast radio bursts**, Calvin Leung et.al., [2509.19514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19514v1)

 Baryonic feedback is a leading contaminant in studying dark matter and cosmology using cosmic shear. This has meant omitting much of the data during cosmological inference, or forward-modeling the spatial distribution of gas around dark matter halos using analytical or hydrodynamical models for baryonic feedback, which introduces nuisance parameters and model dependence. We propose a novel method of ``baryon nulling'' using cross-correlations between shear maps and fast radio burst (FRB) dispersion measures. By directly subtracting the dark matter--dispersion measure cross-correlation, the sensitivity of our nulled power spectra to feedback effects can be significantly reduced without any explicit feedback modeling. Using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamic simulations, whose power spectra span a wide yet realistic range of feedback variations, we demonstrate that our method reduces sensitivity to feedback modeling at $k \approx 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ by about an order of magnitude. This points toward a strong synergy between the next generation of sensitive FRB surveys such as CHORD and the DSA-2000, and cosmic shear surveys such as Rubin, Euclid, and Roman.

2025-09-23, **A Yin-Yang Galaxy Cluster Merger in Abell 1914 Revealed by XRISM**, Annie Heinrich et.al., [2509.19449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19449v1)

 Hierarchical mergers of galaxy clusters play a key role in converting gravitational energy into thermal and kinetic energy in the local universe. Understanding this process requires the reconstruction of cluster merger geometry, with careful consideration of projection effects. With its unprecedented spectral resolution, XRISM enables the disentanglement of merging cluster components along the line-of-sight via X-rays for the first time. In this letter, we focus on the massive cluster A1914, a puzzling case wherein the galaxy and dark matter distribution appear to be in tension with the X-ray morphology. We present XRISM observations of A1914 focusing on the velocity structure of the intracluster medium (ICM). The Resolve full-array spectrum requires two merging components along the line-of-sight, with bulk velocities offset by $\sim$1000 km/s and velocity dispersions of $\sim$200 km/s. The sub-array maps of flux ratios, bulk velocity, and velocity dispersion show the two components are offset and overlapping in the plane of the sky, consistent with a major (mass ratio $\sim$3), near line-of-sight merger with a pericenter distance of $\sim$200 kpc. We conclude that the two subclusters create an overlapping spiral pattern, referred to as a ''yin-yang'' merger. This scenario is further supported by tailored hydrodynamical simulations of the A1914 merger, demonstrating that this type of merger can broadly reproduce the observed X-ray morphology, gas temperature map, gas velocity maps, dark matter distribution, and galaxy velocities. This work demonstrates the power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, provided by XRISM, to resolve complex cluster merger geometries.

2025-09-23, **X-rays from Inelastic Dark Matter Freeze-in**, Gordan Krnjaic et.al., [2509.19428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19428v1)

 We study inelastic dark matter produced via freeze-in through a light mediator with a mass splitting below the electron-positron threshold. In this regime, the heavier dark matter state is naturally long-lived compared to the age of the Universe and decays to the lighter state in association with photons. Given a light mediator, the dark matter abundance is directly related to the decay rate of the heavier dark matter. We show that observations of photons from the galactic center can effectively probe inelastic dark matter freeze-in with mediators at the $100~\rm MeV$ scale and dark matter at the $\rm GeV$ scale.

2025-09-23, **The effects on structure of a momentum coupling between dark matter and quintessence**, G. N. Candlish et.al., [2509.19164v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19164v1)

 Given the mysterious nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the persistent tensions in cosmological data, it is worthwhile exploring more exotic physics in the dark sector, such as a momentum coupling between dark matter and dark energy, specifically in the form of a quintessence field. In this study, using collisionless N-body numerical simulations with a modified version of the RAMSES code, we follow up previous work to investigate the consequences of this model on dark matter halos and their substructures. We consider both the sign of the coupling and the imprints on structure formation and halo properties at a statistical level. We find that there is a clear enhancement (reduction) of substructure if the sign of the coupling is negative (positive) and that the dynamical state of the dark matter halos, particularly host halos, is undervirialised (overvirialised) at redshift zero when compared to uncoupled models or a reference $\Lambda$CDM simulation. Furthermore, positive coupling leads to less concentrated, less cuspy halos, whereas negative coupling leads to the opposite.

2025-09-23, **Constraining Multi-scalars models with colliders and Dark Matter**, Rafael Boto et.al., [2509.19004v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19004v1)

 After the observation in 2012 of a new scalar particle closely resembling the Higgs boson of the Standard Model of particle physics, there is a general consensus that there must be Physics Beyond the Standard Model, with present experiments now dedicated to its discovery. Extending the scalar sector is motivated by key unresolved issues in particle physics including the need of new sources of Charge Parity violation,providing an explanation of the baryon asymmetry in the universe, or to explain Dark Matter, which comprises of order 85% of the matter content of the Universe. In this thesis, we focus on three Higgs doublets models (3HDM) and the constraints that need to be imposed. We add theoretical contributions for the consistency of the scalar potential, with boundedness from below and the global minimum. We consider all constraints for full phenomenological studies in models with different symmetries, studying their individual impact and attempting to distinguish the models based on data. We propose a model with CP violating coefficients, leading to Higgs couplings that significantly deviate from Standard Model values and remain allowed. To explore the parameter space of the model, we employ an efficient Machine Learning algorithm that finds new regions of parameter space and observable consequences, not found with previous techniques we developed and applied. The new techniques are applicable to any Physics Beyond the Standard Model scenario. We connect the scalar extensions with experimentally viable solutions to the Dark Matter problem. When building Dark Matter models, one often imposes conserved discrete symmetries to stabilize DM candidates. We consider a possibility with two candidates, and an alternative possibility of a conserved non-Abelian group leading to a viable DM, in an attempt to chart the limits of what Multi-Higgs Models can accommodate.

2025-09-23, **Biasing from galaxy trough and peak profiles with the DES Y3 redMaGiC galaxies and the weak lensing mass map**, Q. Hang et.al., [2509.18967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18967v1)

 We measure the correspondence between the distribution of galaxies and matter around troughs and peaks in the projected galaxy density, by comparing \texttt{redMaGiC} galaxies ($0.15<z<0.65$) to weak lensing mass maps from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data release. We obtain stacked profiles, as a function of angle $\theta$, of the galaxy density contrast $\delta\_{\rm g}$ and the weak lensing convergence $\kappa$, in the vicinity of these identified troughs and peaks, referred to as `void' and `cluster' superstructures. The ratio of the profiles depend mildly on $\theta$, indicating good consistency between the profile shapes. We model the amplitude of this ratio using a function $F(\boldsymbol{\eta}, \theta)$ that depends on cosmological parameters $\boldsymbol{\eta}$, scaled by the galaxy bias. We construct templates of $F(\boldsymbol{\eta}, \theta)$ using a suite of $N$-body (`Gower Street') simulations forward-modelled with DES Y3-like noise and systematics. We discuss and quantify the caveats of using a linear bias model to create galaxy maps from the simulation dark matter shells. We measure the galaxy bias in three lens tomographic bins (near to far): $2.32^{+0.86}\_{-0.27}, 2.18^{+0.86}\_{-0.23}, 1.86^{+0.82}\_{-0.23}$ for voids, and $2.46^{+0.73}\_{-0.27}, 3.55^{+0.96}\_{-0.55}, 4.27^{+0.36}\_{-1.14}$ for clusters, assuming the best-fit \textit{Planck} cosmology. Similar values with $\sim0.1\sigma$ shifts are obtained assuming the mean DES Y3 cosmology. The biases from troughs and peaks are broadly consistent, although a larger bias is derived for peaks, which is also larger than those measured from the DES Y3 $3\times2$-point analysis. This method shows an interesting avenue for measuring field-level bias that can be applied to future lensing surveys.

2025-09-23, **Constraining Axion-Like Particle mediated Dark Matter with Observational Constraints: A Statistical and Machine Learning Approach**, Prashant Thakur et.al., [2509.18863v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18863v1)

 We present a comprehensive investigation into the phenomenological consequences of axion-like particle (ALP) mediated dark matter (DM) on neutron star (NS) structure. Using a relativistic mean-field framework with non-linear mesonic self-interactions constrained by nuclear data and astrophysical observations, we explore the DM parameter space spanning $m\_\chi \in [0, 1000]~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $q\_f \in [0, 0.06]~\mathrm{GeV}$, generating over 30,000 equations of state (EoSs). Two representative hadronic EoSs are employed, a stiff (EoS1) and a soft (EoS18), with explicit inclusion of the crustal EoS. A multi-tiered statistical filtering scheme, combining voting, likelihood, and kernel density estimation scores, is applied using constraints from radio and X-ray pulsars, GW170817, and the low-mass compact object HESS J1731-347. We find that models satisfying the PSR J0614$-$3329 radius bound automatically comply with HESS, positioning ALP-mediated DM as a viable explanation for low-mass compact objects while still supporting $2\,M\_\odot$ NSs. For the stiff EoS, we obtain $m\_\chi \gtrsim 43~\mathrm{GeV}$, with score-weighted posteriors favoring $q\_f = 0.034^{+0.020}\_{-0.012}$ and a broad allowed DM mass range $m\_\chi \in [101, 949]~\mathrm{GeV}$ (median $\sim 466$ GeV). The soft EoS yields no strict lower bound, though large $m\_\chi$--$q\_f$ combinations are disfavored. A high-precision supervised regression model built with AutoGluon achieves $R^2 > 0.998$ for inferring DM parameters from NS observables. Feature analysis reveals $m\_\chi$ is constrained by structural ratios such as $R\_{1.6}/R\_{1.4}$, whereas $q\_f$ is set mainly by the tidal deformability $\Lambda\_{1.4}$.

2025-09-23, **Three-dimensional Search for Annihilating Dark Matter in CBe dSph with the MAGIC Telescopes**, Stefan Fr√∂se et.al., [2509.18861v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18861v1)

 Dark matter (DM) candidates, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), can annihilate to Standard Model particles, subsequently producing gamma rays. In this work, we search for DM-induced gamma-ray signals from Coma Berenices dwarf spheroidal galaxy (CBe dSph) using approximately 25 hours of observations carried out by the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) Telescope, located at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Spain. Building upon preceding analyses in the gamma-ray regime, we extend the DM search into three dimensions by incorporating spatial information from the assumed DM-density distribution. This approach enhances sensitivity by leveraging both energy and spatial characteristics of the expected signal. The three-dimensional search for a faint signal necessitates the construction of a background model, leading to the proposal of the exclusion-rotation method. This method stacks all observations, excludes the source region, and corrects for the Azimuth-dependent acceptance of the telescopes by rotating the model. Furthermore, the open-source Python package TITRATE is presented, introducing Asimov datasets to the high-level analysis tool Gammapy for the approximation of the test statistic. No evidence of a DM-induced signal for annihilation to $b\bar{b}$, $W^+W^-$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, and $\tau^+\tau^-$ and DM masses $m\_\chi$ between 0.17 TeV and 100 TeV in CBe dSph is found. Consequently, the first upper limits on the thermally averaged cross-section in energy and spatial dimensions using TITRATE are set, leading to a sensitivity improvement over previous results by MAGIC with respect to the assumed DM density in the target halo. The development of the Asimov method for DM search reduces the need for Monte Carlo simulations, paving the way for computationally efficient and scalable large-scale analyses across multiple targets and cosmic messengers.

 Astrophysical jets from powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN) have recently been proposed as promising probes of dark matter (DM) in the sub-GeV mass range. AGN launch relativistic jets that accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to very high energies, which can then interact with their surroundings and produce multiwavelength (MW) emission spanning from radio frequencies to TeV $\gamma$ rays. If DM consists of light particles, their interactions with CRs could lead to an additional cooling mechanism that modifies the expected MW emission. In this work, we analyse the MW spectrum of Markarian 421, a well-studied AGN, using a multizone leptonic jet model that includes the interactions between CR electrons and DM particles. For the first time, we account for the uncertainties in the astrophysical jet dynamics, which have been previously neglected when constraining the CR-DM interactions. By fitting simultaneously jet parameters and DM-electrons interactions, we use the MW data from Markarian 421 to set constraints on the DM-induced CR cooling. We obtain 5$\sigma$ upper limit $\sigma\_\text{DM-e} \lesssim 1 \times 10^{-34}~\text{cm}^2$ for a DM mass of $1~{\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that this is about a factor of five weaker than traditional approaches, implying that properly accounting for degeneracies between jet dynamics and DM interactions is key to derive robust constraints on DM interactions.

2025-09-23, **Effects of galactic environment on accretion dynamics onto a rotating centrally located black hole and on emergent analogue gravity**, Ripon Sk et.al., [2509.18833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18833v1)

 The hydrodynamics of low-angular-momentum, multi-transonic, axisymmetric, inviscid accretion flow onto a rotating black hole has been systematically investigated using three distinct disc geometries and two thermodynamic equations of state, within the framework of a pseudo-Kerr potential. To enhance astrophysical realism, the study incorporates a multi-component galactic potential, modeling the influence of the surrounding stellar distribution, dark matter, and hot gas with the central blackhole. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion of the galactic potential induces subtle yet noteworthy shifts in the locations of sonic points. This effect is particularly pronounced in the vertical equilibrium disc model, where the region allowing for shock formation undergoes significant modification. The nature of critical points is determined by analyzing the eigenvalues of the corresponding stability matrix, establishing that multi-transonicity is restricted to a finite range of angular momentum. Shock strength and associated dynamic \& thermodynamic quantities-such as mach number, pressure, density and temperature-are found to vary sensitively with galactic parameters, and are illustrated through comprehensive parametric plots. Additionally, a time-dependent linear perturbation analysis, demonstrates that the governing perturbation equations retain their structural form even in the presence of a galactic potential. The flows remain stable under adiabatic, radially propagating perturbations. Interestingly, the perturbative framework naturally gives rise to an emergent acoustic metric, identifying the system as a classical analogue of gravity. The corresponding acoustic surface gravity is analytically derived and shown to exhibit a dependence on both the spin of the black hole and the characteristics of the surrounding galactic environment.

 We report the discovery of 164 compact (radius < 1 arcmin) radio rings using MeerKAT 1.3 GHz data from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (l=2-60deg, 252-358deg, \|b\|<1.5deg) and the Galactic Centre mosaic, from a search aimed at identifying previously uncatalogued radio sources. Within this sample, approximately 19 per cent of the rings contain a central point radio source. A multiwavelength analysis reveals a striking diversity: about 40 per cent of the rings enclose an isolated infrared point source, 50 per cent exhibit an extended counterpart in the mid- or far-infrared, and several are only detected in the radio band. We found that 17 per cent of the rings in the sample are positionally coincident (within 5 arcsec) with known entries in SIMBAD, including unclassified infrared sources, spiral galaxies, young stellar objects and long-period variable candidates. Based on these matches and exploiting ancillary multiwavelength data and catalogues, we explore several formation scenarios for the rings, such as HII regions, planetary nebulae, mass-loss relics from evolved massive stars, supernova remnants, nova shells, galaxies, galaxy cluster lenses and odd radio circles. Tentative classifications are proposed for nearly 60 per cent of the sample. These results highlight the potential of MeerKAT to uncover previously undetected compact radio structures and, particularly, recover missing Galactic radio-emitting objects.

2025-09-24, **$S_8$ from Tully-Fisher, fundamental plane, and supernova distances agree with Planck**, Richard Stiskalek et.al., [2509.20235v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20235v1)

 Peculiar velocity measurements constrain the parameter combination $f\sigma\_8$, the product of the linear growth rate $f$ and the fluctuation amplitude $\sigma\_8$. Under the approximation that $f$ is a monotonic function of $\Omega\_{\rm m}$, this can be related to $S\_8 \equiv \sigma\_8 \sqrt{\Omega\_{\rm m}/0.3}$, enabling direct comparison with weak lensing and cosmic microwave background results. We exploit this by using three classes of direct-distance tracers -- the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane, and Type~Ia supernovae -- to infer peculiar velocities. A unified hierarchical forward model jointly calibrates each distance indicator and a linear theory reconstruction of the local Universe. This is the first consistent Bayesian analysis to combine all three major classes of distance indicators within a common framework, enabling cross-checks of systematics across diverse galaxy populations. All three tracers yield consistent values of $S\_8$ that are also in agreement with Planck. Our joint constraint is $S\_8 = 0.819 \pm 0.030$, with the uncertainty dominated by the 2M++ galaxy field. These results demonstrate that peculiar velocity surveys provide a robust, consistent measurement of $S\_8$, and support concordance with the cosmic microwave background.

2025-09-24, **Classification of Unidentified Extended LHAASO Sources based on their Gamma-Ray Morphology: Prospects for Future IACTs**, Alberto Bonollo et.al., [2509.20180v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20180v1)

 While Supernova Remnants (SNRs) are widely considered the primary accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs) up to hundreds of TeV, they struggle to account for the CR flux at PeV energies, suggesting the existence of additional PeVatrons. Observations from LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory) have identified several PeVatron candidates, including some SNRs, pulsar wind nebulae, TeV halos and young massive star clusters (YMSCs). These objects accelerate particles that interact with the surrounding interstellar medium and radiation fields, producing very-high-energy gamma rays (>100 TeV), a key signature of both leptonic and hadronic PeVatrons. We simulate and model the emission of TeV halos and YMSCs, adopting radial emission profiles derived from observational data. Given the current angular resolution of gamma-ray instruments, these profiles often appear similar, making it challenging to distinguish between source classes. We explore how next-generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), namely the CTAO (Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory) and the ASTRI Mini-Array (Astrofisica con Specchi a Tecnologia Replicante Italiana), can classify these sources based on their morphology. We test our classification methods, derived from the profile features of known sources, on simulated CTAO and ASTRI Mini-Array observations of unidentified extended sources from the first LHAASO catalog. We present the results of our analysis to highlight the potential of future IACT observations in identifying the nature of extended gamma-ray sources, refining PeVatron candidate classifications, and improving our understanding of cosmic-ray accelerators.

2025-09-24, **A Search for High-Energy Emission from the Remnant of Supernova 1181**, J. Holder et.al., [2509.20131v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20131v1)

 Over the previous millennium, only five Galactic supernovae were observed and recorded by contemporary astronomers, and their current-day counterparts subsequently identified. The remnants of four of these have all been very deeply studied, and ultimately detected, by TeV instruments after exposures of typically hundreds of hours. The measured TeV fluxes range from 1 Crab (by definition) down to 0.3% Crab. The location of the fifth supernova remnant tied to a historical record of its supernova (SN 1181) has never been studied at TeV energies. The reason for this is simple - the associated remnant was only identified as such in 2021. The remnant, Pa 30, is an unusual object whose properties are best explained as resulting from a Type Iax supernova explosion. These are a rare sub-type of Type Ia supernovae in which the merging white dwarfs are not fully destroyed by the supernova explosion, leading to a double-degenerate merger product colorfully described as a 'zombie star'. We will present the results of a search for TeV gamma-ray emission from Pa 30 with VERITAS.

2025-09-24, **Supergiant GCIRS 22 in the Milky Way Nuclear Star Cluster: Revised alpha abundances**, B. Thorsbro et.al., [2509.20075v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20075v1)

 Context: The chemical abundances of alpha-elements in Galactic Centre (GC) supergiants provide key insights into the chemical enrichment and star formation history of the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster. Previous studies have reported enhanced alpha-element abundances, raising questions about the chemical evolution of this unique region.   Aims: We aim to reassess the alpha-element abundances in the GC supergiant GCIRS 22 using updated spectral modelling and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections to resolve discrepancies from earlier abundance analyses.   Methods: High-resolution near-infrared spectra of GCIRS 22 were analysed using contemporary line lists and precise stellar parameters derived from scandium line diagnostics. We applied comprehensive NLTE corrections to accurately determine the abundances of silicon and calcium.   Results: Our analysis reveals solar-scale alpha abundances ([Ca/Fe] = 0.06 $\pm$ 0.07; [Si/Fe] = $-$0.08 $\pm$ 0.20) for GCIRS 22, significantly lower than previous LTE-based findings. NLTE corrections reduce the calcium abundance by approximately 0.3,dex compared to LTE estimates, aligning our results with recent studies and highlighting the importance of accurate NLTE modelling.   Conclusions: The solar-scale alpha-element abundances observed in GCIRS 22 suggest that recent star formation in the region has not been dominated by Type II supernovae, such as those expected from a recent starburst. Our findings support a scenario of episodic star formation, characterized by intermittent bursts separated by extended quiescent phases, or potentially driven by gas inflows from the inner disk, funnelled by the Galactic bar. Future comprehensive NLTE studies of additional GC stars will be essential for refining our understanding of the region's chemical evolution and star formation history.

2025-09-24, **Analytical modeling of polarization signals arising from confined circumstellar material in Type II supernovae**, T. Nagao et.al., [2509.19874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19874v1)

 Recent observations of Type II supernovae (SNe) have brought a challenge in our understanding on the final evolutionary stage of massive stars. The early-time spectra and light curves of Type II SNe suggest that a majority of them have dense circumstellar material (CSM) in their vicinity, the so-called confined CSM. However, the mechanism of these extensive mass loss has not yet been understood. For addressing this problem, we aim to study the spatial distribution of the confined CSM, which has important information on the mechanism. We analytically calculate the polarization signals created by electron scatterings within disk-like confined CSM, and apply the results to the case of SN 2023ixf. The calculated polarization angle remains fixed at the angle aligned with the CSM disk axis, and is insensitive to the disk parameters. The calculated polarization degree evolves over a timescale of < 10 days, depending on the disk parameters: it stays constant or increases slightly while the unshocked CSM is optically thick, peaks as it becomes optically thin, and drops to zero when the shock reaches the disk's outer edge. We also find that the time evolution of the polarization in Type II SNe with confined CSM can be used for estimating the CSM parameters. In particular, the maximum degree and the rise time are strongly connected to the values of the viewing angle and the opening angle of the CSM disk, while the duration and the decline time are sensitive to the values of the mass and extension of the CSM disk. We demonstrate that the time evolution of the polarization of SN 2023ixf can be explained with a disk-like CSM. This information of the CSM is a strong constraint on the mechanism to create the confined CSM.

2025-09-24, **Effects of multidimensional treatment of gravity in simulations on supernova gravitational waves**, Hajime Sotani et.al., [2509.19724v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19724v1)

 Supernova explosions are expected as one of the promising candidates for gravitational wave sources. In this study, we examine the supernova gravitational waves, focusing on the multidimensional treatment of gravity in the simulation. For this purpose, we newly performed two-dimensional relativistic simulations with a nonmonopole (two-dimensional) potential and compared the resultant gravitational wave signals in the simulations with the frequencies of the proto-neutron stars with and without the Cowling approximation. Then, we find that the proto-neutron star frequencies with the Cowling approximation overestimate the gravitational wave frequencies. On the other hand, the frequencies of the proto-neutron star oscillations with metric perturbations agree well with the gravitational wave signals in the simulations. Employing the new data, we derive a new fitting formula for the supernova gravitational wave frequencies with the two-dimensional gravitational potential, independently of the progenitor mass. Combining this new formula with the previous one derived from the Cowling approximation, we also derive the formula to predict the gravitational wave frequencies with a two-dimensional potential, using those with a monopole potential.

2025-09-23, **Impact of the latest 22Ne+Œ± reaction rates on nucleosynthesis in massive stars and galactic chemical evolution**, Emma Kotar et.al., [2509.19583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19583v1)

 In massive stars (initial mass of > 9 solar masses), the weak s (slow neutron capture) process produces elements between Fe and Zr, enriching the Galaxy with these elements through core-collapse supernova explosions. The weak s-process nucleosynthesis is driven by neutrons produced in the 22Ne({\alpha}, n)25Mg reaction during convective He-core and C-shell burning. The yields of heavy elements thus depend on the 22Ne({\alpha}, n)25Mg and the competitive 22Ne({\alpha}, {\gamma})26Mg reaction rates which are dominated by several narrow-resonance reactions. While the accuracy of these rates has been under debate for decades, recent experimental efforts, including ours, drastically reduced these uncertainties. In this work, we use a set of 280 massive star nucleosynthesis models calculated using different 22Ne({\alpha}, n)25Mg and 22Ne({\alpha}, {\gamma})26Mg rates, and a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) study to probe their impact on the weak s-process elemental abundances in the Galaxy. The GCE was computed with the OMEGA+ code, using the new sets of stellar yields with different 22Ne+{\alpha} rates. From GCE, we find that these rates are causing up to 0.45 dex of variations in the [Cu/Fe], [Ga/Fe], and [Ge/Fe] ratios predicted at solar metallicity. The greatest impact on the stellar nucleosynthesis and GCE results derives from uncertainties in the ({\alpha},n) strength ({\omega}{\gamma}({\alpha},n)) of the Ex=11.32 MeV resonance. We show that the variations observed in the GCE calculations for the weak s-proess elements become negligibly smaller than dispersions found in observations once the {\omega}{\gamma}({\alpha},n) is accurately determined within the uncertaintiy of 10 to 20% (typically reported experimental errors for the resonance) in future nuclear physics experiments.

2025-09-23, **Testing the Constancy of Type Ia Supernova Luminosities with Gaussian Process**, Akshay Rana et.al., [2509.19494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19494v1)

 Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) are central to studies of cosmic expansion, under the assumption that their absolute magnitude $M\_B$ does not evolve with redshift. Even small drifts in brightness can bias cosmological parameters such as $H\_0$ and $w$. Here we test this assumption using a non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction of the expansion history from cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, which provides a model-independent baseline distance modulus, $\mu\_{\rm GP}(z)$. To propagate uncertainties, we draw Monte Carlo realizations of $H(z)$ from the GP posterior and evaluate them on a Chebyshev grid, which improves numerical stability and quadrature accuracy. Supernova observations are then compared to this baseline through residuals, $\Delta M\_B(z)$, and their derivatives. Applying this method to Pantheon+ (1701 SNe~Ia) and DES 5YR (435 SNe~Ia), we find that SNe~Ia are consistent with being standard candles within $1\sigma$, though both datasets exhibit localized departures: near $z \sim 1$ in Pantheon+ and at $z \sim 0.3$--$0.5$ in DES. The presence of similar features in two independent surveys suggests they are not purely statistical. Our results point toward a possible non-monotonic luminosity evolution, likely reflecting different physical drivers at different epochs, and highlight the need for a deeper astrophysical understanding of SN~Ia populations.

2025-09-23, **Two-moment cosmic ray transport in RAMSES**, Joki Rosdahl et.al., [2509.19447v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19447v1)

 Cosmic rays (CRs) are an important source of feedback in a variety of astrophysical contexts. Magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations treating CRs as a fluid have shown that how their feedback operates is strongly dependent on their transport properties such as diffusion and streaming. In this paper we introduce the numerical implementation, in the adaptive-mesh-refinement MHD code RAMSES, of the grey two-moment formulation of CR fluid dynamics, which follows the energy density and its associated three-dimensional flux. This method is tested for CR diffusion, streaming, and advection in a series of multi-dimensional tests including shocks to check the robustness and stability of this numerical two-moment CRMHD solver. We finally use the new two-moment CR implementation in a complex simulation of an isolated galactic disc producing galaxy-wide outflows launched by small-scale supernova explosions, and compare it with a previously existing one-moment formulation in the same code.

2025-09-23, **Formation and Diagnostic Use of Carbon Lines in Stripped-Envelope Supernovae**, Stan Barmentloo et.al., [2509.19438v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19438v1)

 Carbon is one of the main end products of nucleosynthesis in massive stars. In this work, we study the emission signatures of carbon in spectra of stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe). A grid of model nebular spectra is created using the NLTE radiative transfer code SUMO, with stellar evolution- and explosion models as inputs. In the models, [C I] {\lambda}8727 and [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 are identified as the only significant optical carbon lines, with contribution from both the O/C and He/C zones. To obtain estimates of L\_[C I] {\lambda}8727, which is blended with the Ca II triplet, we introduce and apply the CaNARY code, a publicly available Monte Carlo scattering code. We study carbon lines in a sample of SESNe, and find that luminosities of [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 relative to the optical spectrum increase with time, just as in our model grid. However, the relative luminosities of both [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 and [C I] {\lambda}8727 are overproduced in our models. Multiple explanations for this discrepancy, such as too high carbon abundances in the stellar evolution models and underestimated cooling through molecule formation, are investigated. For those SNe where both lines are clearly observed, we use an analytical formalism to constrain their ejected carbon masses to the range ~0.2 - 2 Msun. However, several SNe yield upper limits of 0.05 Msun. We also show that [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 is a useful line to diagnose both carbon mass and the extent of the He/C zone. We strongly encourage observers and instrumentalists to target [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 in future SN observing campaigns.

2025-09-23, **Gravitational waves from magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae using 3D GRMHD simulations: effect of rotation and magnetic fields**, Sophia C. Schnauck et.al., [2509.19424v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19424v1)

 We investigate the gravitational wave emission for 10 supernova progenitors from magnetorotational core-collapse to the supernova explosion using fully three-dimensional dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations with the GPU-accelerated code $\texttt{GRaM-X}$. We consider 2 progenitors of zero-age-main-sequence mass $25M\_\odot$ and 8 with zero-age-main-sequence masses of $35M\_\odot$. For these models, we explore a range of rotation rates between $0.0$ and $3.5 \mathrm{rad}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, along with initial seed magnetic field of either $10^{12}\mathrm{G}$ or $10^{13}\mathrm{G}$. The analysis of the 10 models presented provides a comprehensive and systematic initial investigation of the interplay between progenitor rotation, magnetic field strength, and progenitor structure in shaping the explosion dynamics and gravitational wave (GW) emission. We find that stronger seed magnetic fields ($10^{13}\mathrm{G}$) suppress the GW strain amplitude relative to models with weaker initial fields ($10^{12}\mathrm{G}$). Increasing the initial rotation rate results in a more dynamical explosion, yielding correspondingly stronger gravitational waves. In addition, the progenitor mass/composition also exhibit a significant impact on the explosion dynamics and the morphology of the resulting waveforms. Finally, we find that all of our models lie above the detectability threshold for 3rd generation detectors aLIGO, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic explorer at a $10\mathrm{kpc}$ distance and most would even still be detectable at $10\mathrm{Mpc}$, opening the possibility for observing gravitational wave emission for CCSNe beyond our galaxy.

2025-09-23, **Spectral Uniformity of Little Red Dots: A Natural Outcome of Coevolving Seed Black Holes and Nascent Starbursts**, Kohei Inayoshi et.al., [2509.19422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19422v1)

 The birth of seeds of massive black holes (BHs) and nascent galaxies at cosmic dawn takes place in dense gaseous environments, which play a crucial role in shaping their coevolution and radiation spectra. We investigate gas accretion during the assembly of massive halos with $M\_{\rm h}\gtrsim 10^{10-11}~M\_\odot$ at redshifts $z\simeq 4-10$, driving both rapid BH feeding and concurrent nuclear starbursts. As the BH grows to $\sim 10^{6-7}~M\_\odot$ via super-Eddington accretion, the accretion power inflates a dense envelope whose effective temperature approaches the Hayashi limit at $T\_{\rm eff}\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$, producing red optical emission, while a coeval young stellar population of $\sim 10^7~M\_\odot$ provides blue UV emission. This early coevolving system naturally reproduces the characteristic spectral features of the so-called little red dots (LRDs), a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including the V-shaped UV-to-optical spectra and weakness of X-ray, infrared, and radio emission. Massive stars in the nuclear starburst soon explode as supernovae, injecting energy and momentum that expel gas from the nucleus, quench gas supply to the BH envelope, and ultimately drive a transition into normal AGN phases. For individual LRDs, the optical-to-UV luminosity ratio remains nearly constant at $L\_{\rm opt}/L\_{\rm UV}\simeq 2-10$ from the onset of accretion bursts for $\simeq 15~{\rm Myr}$, one-third of the Salpeter time, until quenching by stellar feedback. While this ratio is sustained for the LRD population at $z\simeq 4-8$, it declines toward lower redshifts as BHs can no longer maintain red envelopes, thereby losing the LRD characteristics.

2025-09-23, **Jittering jets promote dust formation in core-collapse supernovae**, Noam Soker et.al., [2509.19264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19264v1)

 I find that the dust morphologies in some core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants (CCSNRs) possess jet-shaped morphologies, and propose that the properties of the jets that explode the CCSNe and their interaction with the core and envelope (if it exists) are among the factors that determine the amount of dust formed and its morphology. I find that some of the dust-rich structures in the CCSNRs Cassiopeia A and the Crab Nebula are distributed in point-symmetric morphologies, and that the dust in SN 1987A follows the bipolar morphology of the inner ejecta. Earlier studies attributed these morphologies in these CCSNRs to shaping by jets in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). These dust morphologies suggest, in the framework of the JJEM, that exploding jets enhance dust formation in CCSNRs. This study adds to the variety of processes that CCSN exploding jets are involved in and to the establishment of the JJEM as the explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

2025-09-23, **Magnetar-like flares behind the high-energy emission in LS 5039**, V. Bosch-Ramon et.al., [2509.19173v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19173v1)

 LS 5039 hosts a high-mass star, and a compact object that might be a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS). This scenario requires a mechanism to power its persistent and strong non-thermal emission. We investigate a mechanism in which the non-steady interaction structure of the stellar and the NS winds can regularly excite NS magnetospheric activity, releasing extra energy and fueling the source non-thermal emission. The NS wind shocked by the stellar wind can recurrently touch the NS magnetosphere, triggering magnetic instabilities whose growth can release extra energy into the NS wind in a cyclic manner. To illustrate and study the impact of these cycles on the two-wind interaction structure on different scales, we performed relativistic hydrodynamics simulations in 2D and 3D with periods of an enhanced power in the NS wind along the orbit. We also used analytical tools to characterize processes near the NS relevant for the non-thermal emission. As the NS wind termination shock touches the magnetosphere energy dissipation occurs, but the whole shocked two-wind structure is eventually driven away halting the extra energy injection. However, due to the corresponding drop in the NS wind ram pressure, the termination shock propagates back towards the magnetosphere, resuming the process. These activity cycles excite strong waves in the shocked flows, intensifying their mixing and the disruption of their spiral-like structure produced by orbital motion. Further downstream, the shocked winds can become a quasi-stable, relatively smooth flow. The recurrent interaction between the NS magnetosphere and shocked wind can fuel a relativistic outflow powerful enough to explain the non-thermal emission of LS 5039. A magnetospheric multipolar magnetic field much stronger than the dipolar one may provide the required energetics, and help to explain the lack of evidence of a recent supernova remnant.

 NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will provide an opportunity to study dark energy with unprecedented precision using several techniques, including measurements of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia). Here, we present `phrosty` (PHotometry for ROman with SFFT for tYpe Ia supernovae): a difference imaging pipeline for measuring the brightness of transient point sources in the sky, primarily SNe Ia, using Roman data. `phrosty` is written in Python. We implement a GPU-accelerated version of the Saccadic Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT) method for difference imaging.

2025-09-23, **A recent re-acceleration of the Local Bubble revealed by kinematics of young star associations**, Guang-Ya Zeng et.al., [2509.18525v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18525v1)

 The low-density region of the interstellar medium (ISM) where the Sun is located is known as the Local Bubble, a cavity filled with high-temperature and low-density plasma that may be created by a series of supernova (SN) explosions over the past 14 Myr. However, the effects of these SN explosions on the formation and evolution of the Local Bubble, as well as on nearby star formation, remain not fully understood. To study the expansion history of the Local Bubble, we use the kinematic data of the young stars obtained by cross-matching the pre-main-sequence (PMS) star catalog of \citet{Zari2018} with the high-precision astrometric and photometric data from the {\it Gaia} DR3 database. We perform a three-dimensional spatial clustering analysis on these young stars to identify star associations. We discover three unique star associations that exhibit a wiggle-like velocity pattern. The distances of these star associations are 108.5308, 141.5284, and 176.0318 pc, respectively. Their radial velocities in the Local Standard of Rest (LSR) are 10.0622, 5.4982, and 9.0581 km/s, showing a pattern of decreasing and then increasing. This velocity pattern, as predicted by \citet{Krause&Diehl2014}, is caused by a recent re-acceleration affected by the SN explosion, reinforcing the picture of the Local Bubble as an evolving entity.
