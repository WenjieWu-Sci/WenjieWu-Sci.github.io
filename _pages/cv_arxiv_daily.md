2025-09-30, **Dynamical equilibria of fast neutrino flavor conversion**, Jiabao Liu et.al., [2509.26418v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26418v1)

 Dense neutrino systems, which display collectivity mediated by the weak interaction, have deep parallels with mean-field kinetic systems governed by other fundamental forces. We identify analogues in fast flavor conversion (FFC) of some time-honored nonlinear phenomena in plasmas and self-gravitating systems. We focus in particular on nonlinear Landau damping and collisionless equilibria, which are likely important pieces of the unsolved puzzle of neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. Our analysis additionally reveals the previously unexplored phenomenon of flavor-wave synchronization.

2025-09-30, **Precision measurement and modelling of the threshold-free 210Pb β spectrum**, Shuo Zhang et.al., [2509.26390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26390v1)

 Beta decay is a fundamental process that governs nuclear stability and serves as a sensitive probe of the weak interaction and possible physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. However, precise measurements of complete \beta decay spectra, particularly at low energies, remain experimentally and theoretically challenging. Here we report a high-precision, threshold-free measurement of the full \beta decay spectrum of 210Pb to excited states of 210Bi, using a transition-edge sensor (TES)-based micro-calorimeter. This approach enables the detection of \beta particle energies from 0 keV up to their endpoint by coincidence summing with subsequent de-excitation energy, thereby eliminating reconstruction artifacts near zero energy that have traditionally limited low-energy spectral accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first complete, high-precision \beta decay spectrum from 0 keV. The data resolve theoretical uncertainties associated with the atomic quantum exchange (AQE) effect. An accompanying ab initio theoretical framework, incorporating atomic, leptonic, and nuclear components, predicts a statistically significant (7.2 {\sigma}) enhancement in \beta emission probability near zero energy, in agreement with the measurement and in contrast to models that omit AQE corrections. These results provide a new benchmark for \beta decay theory at low energies, deepen our understanding of the weak interaction, and establish a critical foundation for searches for new physics, including dark matter interactions and precision studies of neutrinos.

2025-09-30, **Impact of Evaporation Barriers on Solar-Captured Dark Matter Distributions and Evaporation Mass**, Xuan Wen et.al., [2509.26192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26192v1)

 Dark matter (DM) particles traversing the Sun can lose energy through elastic scattering with solar nuclei and become gravitationally captured. For DM with masses below a few GeV, however, evaporation caused by collisions with hot nuclei efficiently ejects particles, preventing their long-term accumulation. This defines a minimum mass threshold, typically around a few GeV, below which the Sun cannot retain DM. In this work, we investigate how an additional evaporation barrier - arising either from multiple scattering in an optically thick regime or from a long-range DM-nucleon interaction - modifies this equilibrium. We compute the transport and thermalization of captured DM using a phase-space approach that evolves the orbital distribution rather than assuming a Maxwellian form. Without a barrier, we recover the standard result that evaporation dominates for sub-few-GeV DM, leading to negligible net retention. With a barrier, however, the escape of light DM is strongly suppressed, enabling the Sun to capture and retain particles below the canonical evaporation mass. The barrier effectively raises the escape threshold, either through repeated scatterings or through an additional long-range attractive potential. We present the resulting phase-space distributions, density and velocity profiles, and highlight how the suppression of the high-velocity tail drives the captured population closer to thermal equilibrium with the solar core. These modifications increase the equilibrium abundance of light DM by orders of magnitude and have direct implications for solar neutrino searches as an indirect probe of DM.

2025-09-30, **Cosmological constraints on non-phantom dynamical dark energy with DESI Data Release 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations: A 3$σ$+ lensing anomaly**, Shouvik Roy Choudhury et.al., [2509.26144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26144v1)

 We consider a 12-parameter cosmological model with non-phantom dynamical dark energy (NPDDE), where non-phantom implies that the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy (DE), $w(z)\geq-1$ for all redshifts $z$. Thus, the DE EoS covers the parameter space corresponding to the popular single scalar-field dark energy models, i.e., Quintessence. The cosmological model comprises 6 parameters of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, and additionally the dynamical DE EoS parameters ($w\_0$, $w\_a$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A\_{\rm lens}$), sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m\_\nu$), the effective number of non-photon relativistic degrees of freedom ($N\_{\rm eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha\_s$). We derive constraints on the parameters by combining the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from Planck Public Release (PR) 4, CMB lensing data from Planck PR4 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL) data from DES Year 1. Our major finding is that with CMB+BAO+WL and CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, we find 3$\sigma$+ evidence for $A\_{\rm lens} >1$, indicating a higher than expected CMB lensing amplitude relative to the NPDDE prediction of unity. This implies that for cosmology to accommodate realistic quintessence-like dark energy models (as opposed to unrealistic phantom DE), one would also need to explain a relatively significant presence of the lensing anomaly.

2025-09-30, **Efficient tau-pair invariant mass reconstruction with simplified matrix element techniques**, Artur Kalinowski et.al., [2509.26069v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26069v1)

 The quality of the invariant mass reconstruction of the di-{\tau} system is crucial for searches and analyses of di-{\tau} resonances. Due to the presence of neutrinos in the final state, the {\tau} {\tau} invariant mass cannot be calculated directly at hadron colliders, where the longitudinal momentum sum constraint cannot be applied. A number of approaches have been adopted to mitigate this issue. The most general one uses Matrix Element (ME) integration for likelihood estimation, followed by invariant mass reconstruction as the value maximizing the likelihood. However, this method has a significant computational cost due to the need for integration over the phase space of the decay products. We propose an algorithm that reduces the computational cost by two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the resolution of the invariant mass reconstruction at a level comparable to the ME-based method. Moreover, we introduce additional features to estimate the uncertainty of the reconstructed mass and the kinematics of the initial {\tau} leptons (e.g., their momenta).

2025-09-30, **Search for UHE neutrinos from GRBs with the Pierre Auger Observatory**, Yago Lema-Capeans et.al., [2509.25962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25962v1)

 We report on the search for ultra-high-energy neutrinos from the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using Surface Detector (SD) data from Phase I of the Pierre Auger Observatory (2004-2021). A total of 570 GRBs occur within the most neutrino-sensitive field of view of the SD, considering both Earth-skimming and downward-going detection channels. For this purpose, GRB neutrino emission has been modeled using the numerical software NeuCosmA, incorporating gamma-ray measurements and inferred parameters such as the jet Lorentz factor and the minimum variability time scale. No neutrino candidates were found, and upper limits were obtained by stacking the individual GRB neutrino fluences. These limits are complementary to those of IceCube and ANTARES and provide the strongest constraints on prompt GRB neutrino fluence above $10^{18}$ eV. Additionally, limits on GRB fluence in alternative models of neutrino production have been derived using Auger data.

2025-09-29, **Development Status of the KIPM Detector Consortium**, Dylan J Temples et.al., [2509.25544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25544v1)

 A Kinetic Inductance Phonon-Mediated Detector is a calorimeter that uses kinetic inductance detectors to read out phonon signals from the device substrate. We have established a consortium comprising university and national lab groups dedicated to advancing the state of the art in these detectors, with the ultimate goal of designing a detector sub-eV threshold on energy deposited in the substrate, enabling searches for both light dark matter and low-energy neutrino interactions. This consortium brings together experts in kinetic inductance detector design, phonon and quasiparticle dynamics, and noise modeling, along with specialized fabrication facilities, test platforms, and unique calibration capabilities. Recently, our consortium has demonstrated a resolution on energy absorbed by the sensor of 2.1 eV, the current record for such devices. The current focus of the consortium is modeling and improving the phonon collection efficiency and implementing low-$\boldsymbol{T\_c}$ superconductors, both of which serve to improve the overall energy resolution and threshold of the detectors.

2025-09-29, **Extra Radiation Cosmologies: Implications of the Hubble Tension for eV-scale Neutrinos**, Helena García Escudero et.al., [2509.25478v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25478v1)

 We present a new analysis on sterile neutrino cosmologies using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB), CMB lensing, and supernova data. We show that BAO observables are intrinsically less sensitive to the combined effects of relativistic energy density, $N\_{\rm eff}$, and the sum of neutrino masses, $\Sigma m\_\nu$, which are both augmented in sterile neutrino cosmologies. With SH0ES local expansion rate, $H\_0$, data, we find $N\_{\rm eff} = 3.43 \pm 0.13$, reducing the Hubble tension to $2.4\sigma$. For a 0.1~eV sterile neutrino, we find $N\_{\rm eff}=3.50$ as the best fit. For this representative $N\_{\rm eff}$, we find an upper limit of $m\_s < 0.17$ eV (95\% CL), greater than a factor of four weaker than standard constraints on $\Sigma m\_\nu$. When SH0ES is included, light sterile neutrinos with masses $m\_s\simeq0.1$--$0.2$ eV are favored at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$, whereas eV-scale sterile masses remain strongly excluded by the data in the cosmologies we study. Our findings confirm our previous results that partially thermalized sub-eV sterile neutrinos are preferred by the SH0ES $H\_0$ data. The preferred $m\_s$ mass scale overlaps with, but is not identical to, that favored in neutrino oscillation solutions to short-baseline anomalies.

2025-09-29, **VERITAS Follow-Up Observations of the Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A**, Connor Mooney et.al., [2509.25422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25422v1)

 The recent announcement of the detection of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT telescope represents a critical opportunity to explore the origins of cosmic neutrinos and their potential gamma-ray counterparts. With an inferred neutrino energy exceeding 100 PeV, this event stands as the most energetic neutrino observed to date. The large offset from the galactic plane (11 degrees) and the presence of several blazars with temporally correlated multiwavelength counterparts within the 3 degrees localization region raise the possibility of an extragalactic origin. Additionally, the event's apparent tension with IceCube constraints suggests that it could be transient in nature rather than cosmogenic. VERITAS conducted a targeted follow-up campaign to search for very-high-energy (VHE, greater than 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission associated with KM3-230213A. Observations were performed in February and March 2025, using a four-point wobble strategy centered on the best-fit neutrino position, covering nearly the entire 90 percent confidence region. These observations probe potential hadronic gamma-ray emission from a common origin with the neutrino, placing constraints on particle-acceleration scenarios. We present the results of this search, including upper limits on very-high-energy gamma-ray flux and their implications for possible source models of KM3-230213A.

2025-09-29, **CP-conserving SO(3) parameterization of the neutrino mixing matrix**, Jarosław Duda et.al., [2509.25328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25328v1)

 The pattern of neutrino mixing, usually parameterized by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata $U\_{\rm PMNS}$ matrix, still remains a striking puzzle in particle physics. $U\_{\rm PMNS}$ is one of six possible products of multiplying three Euler matrices. Here we discuss the neutrino mixing matrix parameterization for three known flavours of neutrinos based on the SO(3) group represented by one three-dimensional rotation matrix $U\_{\rm SO3}$. The mixing matrix $U\_{\rm SO3}$ with cyclic order of the Lie group generators implies $\delta\_{\rm{CP}}=180^\circ$ for clockwise rotation in three dimensions, a viable scenario for normal mass ordering. We determine a range of rotation angles for $U\_{\rm SO3}$ which deviate substantially from the almost maximal mixings in the standard $U\_{\rm PMNS}$ scenario, yielding `democratic' values for the mixing angles. With the fixed $\delta\_{\rm CP}$ value, the $U\_{\rm SO3}$ parameterization can be validated or falsified by the next generation of neutrinoless double beta decay experiments and puts a stringent constraint on the absolute neutrino mass. The proposed $U\_{\rm SO3}$ neutrino mixing parameterization is suited for independent CP-conserving neutrino oscillation experimental analysis.

2025-09-29, **Thermal Damping of Neutrino-Coupled Scalar Dark Matter**, Abhishek Banerjee et.al., [2509.25308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25308v1)

 We point out that ultralight scalar dark matter that modulates neutrino masses can be significantly thermal damped by cosmic neutrinos in the early universe. This dissipative effect arises as a backreaction from the neutrinos which are being driven slightly out of thermal equilibrium by the scalar. We estimate the rate of such thermal damping and explore its phenomenological implications. For a scalar that is produced early, we find that the effect of thermal damping results in a predictable final abundance largely insensitive to its initial condition while circumventing late time limits. This motivates a parameter-space line to target experimentally.

2025-09-29, **Cosmological tensions in the era of precision cosmology: Insights from Tensions in Cosmology 2025**, Eleonora Di Valentino et.al., [2509.25288v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25288v1)

 The ``Tensions in Cosmology'' series of conferences has been established as one of the main venues where the cosmological community collectively assesses the cracks in the concordance model and explores possible theoretical and observational remedies. The 2025 edition, held once again in Corfu, Greece, came at a crucial time: the Hubble constant $H\_0$ discrepancy has now exceeded $6\sigma$, and new high-precision data from DESI, JWST, ACT, and other facilities have made this tension more robust while opening new windows on the early and late Universe. The $S\_8$ tension, though milder and survey-dependent, remains an important probe of late-time structure formation, while emerging anomalies involving dynamical dark energy and neutrino physics are gaining increasing attention as potential signs of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Here we provide a report on the meeting and an update on the state of the tensions in 2025, highlighting progress since the pioneering 2022 event.

2025-09-29, **Direct detection of electromagnetically interacting ultraheavy dark matter**, Jason Kumar et.al., [2509.24938v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24938v1)

 At a level too faint for astronomy, particle dark matter may interact with Standard Model states via the photon. We derive limits from direct detection experiments on photon-mediated nuclear interactions up to operator dimension-6, viz., via a millicharge, charge radius, electric and magnetic dipole moment, and anapole moment, up to dark matter masses $\lesssim 10^{17}$ GeV, where detectors become flux-limited. We derive constraints for XENON1T, XENONnT, LZ, PANDAX-II, PANDAX-4T, DarkSide-50, DEAP-3600, PICO-60, and CDMS-II, and estimate future sensitivities for the multi-deca-tonne scale experiments DarkSide-20k, DARWIN/XLZD, PANDAX-xT, and Argo. Special attention is paid to millicharged dark matter, for which we constrain new parameter space by deriving the ceiling on sensitivity to its electric charge, arising from the nuclear-vs-electron recoil discriminants used in liquid argon and bubble chamber detectors. This result goes beyond ceilings previously identified in liquid xenon and semiconductor detectors from electron recoil vetoes. In particular, the ceiling from PICO-60 closes a large window between direct detection and neutrino experiment limits for dark matter masses below $10^{12}$ GeV.

2025-09-29, **Lepton number violating signals of a parity symmetric model at $μ$TRISTAN**, Keisuke Harigaya et.al., [2509.24680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24680v1)

 The parity solution to the strong CP problem necessarily extends the Standard Model to include the SU$(2)\_{\rm R}$ gauge sector and imposes restrictions on the structure of the Yukawa interactions. In this framework, one can consider an appealing structure of the neutrino sector in which the smallness of the neutrino masses is naturally explained, while lepton number symmetry is substantially violated at the TeV scale. Observation of distinctive lepton number violating signals at collider experiments can therefore be expected, since the rates are not suppressed by the small neutrino masses. We study the constraints from neutrinoless double beta decay and discuss the prospects for discovering new TeV-scale particles, such as the $W'$ boson of SU$(2)\_{\rm R}$, via lepton number violating processes at a $\mu^+ \mu^+$ collider, $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to W^+ W'^+$. A $\mu^+ \mu^+$ collider with a center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV can probe the $W'$ boson mass up to about 10 TeV through on-shell production, and the reach can extend to 16 TeV by studying processes involving off-shell $W'$ boson.

2025-09-29, **Uncertainty in the time of arrival of ultra high energetic neutrinos**, Fedele Lizzi et.al., [2509.24516v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24516v1)

 In the light of the recent observation by the KM3NeT collaboration of an ultrahigh energetic neutrino, we analyse it in its rest frame, where shortly after creation of the neutrino a muon arrives and interacts. Since the neutrino is at rest we use (in this first analysis) a non relativistic Gaussian wave function, and consider its spread. Due to the finite size of the packet, the time of the interaction of the muon will have an uncertainty. This uncertainty is small in the neutrino rest frame, but boosted to our frame, increases 18 orders of magnitude, making it extremely large. This effectively prevents the possibility of the observation of bursts, or the correlation with other events. A similar analysis for less energetic neutrinos show that the uncertainty is smaller than the duration of the observed bursts.

 The REDTOP experiment is a proposed super-$\eta$/$\eta'$ factory aimed at exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in the MeV-GeV range and rare $\eta$/$\eta'$ meson decays. With projected production rates exceeding $10^{13}$ $\eta$/year and $10^{12}$ $\eta'$/year, REDTOP will enable studies of symmetry violations and all four portals to the Dark Sector. Preliminary studies show sensitivity, which could open a broad possibility for exploring new physics and contribute to a deeper understanding of fundamental interactions within the Standard Model. Such high statistics experiments and the required sensitivity can only be achieved with a high intensity proton or pion beam, available at several accelerator facilities worldwide. This article discusses the physics potential of the REDTOP experiment, the detector design, and the future beam requirements.

2025-09-30, **Supersymmetric Axionic model in N = 1 Wess-Zumino gauge from CFJ approach**, C. Roldán-Domínguez et.al., [2509.26089v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26089v1)

 The main purpose behind this work has been to construct a Supersymmetric extension of Axionic Electrodynamics based on a Lorentz Symmetry-Violating framework. Thus, in addition to the axion and the photon, our model naturally incorporates its supersymmetric partners - the axino and the photino - and allows for the interaction between them. This enriches the Axionic Electrodynamics not only from a theoretical standpoint but also for its phenomenological relevance, providing additional interactions between possible dark matter candidates.

2025-09-30, **The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited: II. Rotational Halo Properties**, Eduard Salvador-Solé et.al., [2509.26081v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26081v1)

 The peak model of structure formation was built more than fifty years ago with the aim to address the origin of dark matter halo rotation in the tidal torque theory (TTT). Paradoxically, it has allowed one to explain and reproduce all halo properties found in cosmological simulations except their rotation, which remains to be understood. With the present two Papers we remedy this anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order, their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results obtained explain and reproduce the rotational properties of simulated halos.

2025-09-30, **Signatures of dark subhalos in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: I. Fluctuations in surface density**, Eduardo Vitral et.al., [2509.26056v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26056v1)

 Dark matter (DM) subhalos offer critical tests of cosmological models through their abundance and properties, yet most remain undetectable due to their lack of stars. We investigate whether their presence leaves measurable imprints on the projected stellar density fields of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Building on literature $N$-body experiments, we show that subhalo interactions induce subtle out-of-equilibrium fluctuations appearing as density corrugations. In a CDM framework, these fluctuations are dominated by the most massive subhalos in the host halo. We develop a Fourier-based framework to quantify these features, identifying characteristic peaks in the spatial frequency spectrum that are well described by Voigt profiles. The peak parameters are sensitive to both the subhalo mass function and the number of stellar tracers. For the configurations tested, $N\_{\star} \sim 10^5$ stars suffice to detect subhalo populations with $M\_{\rm subhalo} \lesssim 10^6~\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$, while larger masses produce stronger and more complex signatures. We assess the feasibility of this technique by analyzing Gaia and HST data: in this context, the Fornax dwarf shows residual low-frequency structures resembling those in our controlled subhalo experiments, making it an interesting case for follow-up. Prospectively, wide-field surveys such as Euclid, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are expected to deliver stellar samples of $N\_{\star} \sim 10^5$ per dwarf, offering compelling prospects for probing subhalo imprints. Our results introduce a novel pathway to constrain the subhalo mass function in dSphs, and motivate follow-up work that incorporates alternative DM models and additional dynamical perturbations.

2025-09-30, **Searching for Dark Structures: A Comparison of Weak Lensing Convergence Maps and Lensing-Weighted Galaxy Density Maps**, Soojin Kim et.al., [2509.25836v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25836v1)

 We present the result of a comparison between the dark matter distribution inferred from weak gravitational lensing and the observed galaxy distribution to identify dark structures with a high dark matter-to-galaxy density ratio. To do this, we use weak lensing convergence maps from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, and construct corresponding galaxy convergence maps at $z\lesssim1.0$, representing projected galaxy number density fluctuations weighted by lensing efficiency. The two maps show overall agreement. However, we could identify 22 regions where the dark matter density exhibits an excess compared to the galaxy density. After carefully examining the survey depths and proximity to survey boundaries, we select seven of the most probable candidates for dark structures. This sample provides valuable testbeds for further investigations into dark matter mapping. Moreover, our method will be very useful for future studies of dark structures as large-scale weak-lensing surveys become available, such as the $\textit{Euclid}$ mission, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

2025-09-30, **Effect of dark matter halo environment on GW memory signal**, Soumya Bhattacharya et.al., [2509.25819v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25819v1)

 In this paper, we study the gravitational wave (GW) memory effect for a black hole embedded in a dark matter halo described by a Hernquist-type density profile, both with and without a spike. We first solve the geodesic equations in this spacetime under the influence of a GW pulse to examine how the combined effects of the dark matter halo and the GW pulse modify the geodesic deviation equation and particle trajectories. We then investigate how the memory effect manifests in the waveform in the presence of the dark matter halo. To do that, we analyze the memory contribution at asymptotic null infinity using the Bondi-Sachs formalism and, in particular, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) flux balance laws associated with BMS symmetries. This framework allows us to quantify the GW memory contribution to the waveform, incorporate it into the ringdown waveform templates, and thereby provide a possible avenue for extracting information about the dark matter halo parameters.

2025-09-30, **On the shape of pancakes: catastrophe theory and Gaussian statistics in 2D**, Abineet Parichha et.al., [2509.25608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25608v1)

 Cold dark matter (CDM) can be thought of as a 2D (or 3D) sheet of particles in 4D (or 6D) phase-space due to its negligible velocity dispersion. The large-scale structure, also called the cosmic web, is thus a result of the topology of the CDM manifold. Initial crossing of particle trajectories occurs at the critical points of this manifold, forming singularities that seed most of the collapsed structures. The cosmic web can thus be characterized using the points of singularities. In this context, we employ catastrophe theory in 2D to study the motion around such singularities and analytically model the shape of the emerging structures, particularly the pancakes, which later evolve into halos and filaments-the building blocks of the 2D web. We compute higher-order corrections to the shape of the pancakes, including properties such as the curvature and the scale of transition from their C to S shape. Using Gaussian statistics (with the assumption of Zeldovich flow) for our model parameters, we also compute the distributions of observable features related to the shape of pancakes and their variation across halo and filament populations in 2D cosmologies. We find that a larger fraction of pancakes evolve into filaments, they are more curved if they are to evolve into halos, are dominantly C-shaped, and the nature of shell-crossing is highly anisotropic. Extending this work to 3D will allow testing of predictions against actual observations of the cosmic web and searching for signatures of non-Gaussianity at corresponding scales.

2025-09-29, **Machine Learning the Dark Matter Halo Mass of the Milky Way**, Elaheh Hayati et.al., [2509.25362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25362v1)

 Although numerous dynamical techniques have been developed to estimate the total dark matter halo mass of the Milky Way, it remains poorly constrained, with typical systematic uncertainties of 0.3 dex. In this study, we apply a neural network-based approach that achieves high mass precision without several limitations that have affected past approaches; for example, we do not assume dynamical equilibrium, nor do we assume that neighboring galaxies are bound satellites. Additionally, this method works for a broad mass range, including for halos that differ significantly from the Milky Way. Our model relies solely on observable dynamical quantities, such as satellite orbits, distances to larger nearby halos, and the maximum circular velocity of the most massive satellite. In this paper, we measure the halo mass of the Milky Way to be $\log\_{10} M\_\mathrm{vir}/\Msun = 12.20^{+0.163}\_{-0.138}$. Future studies in this series will extend this methodology to estimate the dark matter halo mass of M31, and develop new neural networks to infer additional halo properties including concentration, assembly history, and spin axis.

 Cosmic voids are key elements in our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe. They are crucial to constrain cosmological parameters, understand the structure formation and evolution of our Universe, and they could also be pristine laboratories for studying galaxy formation without all the hassle due to environmental effects. Thus, the ability to accurately and consistently identify voids, both in numerical simulations and in observations, becomes mandatory. We present Algorithm for Void Identification in coSMology (AVISM), a new void finder for analysing both cosmological simulation outputs and observational galaxy catalogues. In the first case, the code should handle raw particle or cell data, dark matter halos or synthetic galaxy catalogues. In the case of observational data, the code should be coupled with external tools providing with the required dynamical information to apply the algorithm. A set of numerical tests designed to assess the code's capabilities are carried out. AVISM's performance is also compared, both statistically and on a one-to-one basis, with the DIVE and ZOBOV state-of-the-art void finders using as input a dark matter halo catalogue from a large-volume cosmological simulation. An application to a galaxy survey is provided to demonstrate the code's ability to handle real data. We have designed a new void finder algorithm that combines geometrical and dynamical information to identify void regions plus a hierarchical merging process to reconstruct the whole 3D structure of the void. The outcome of this process is a void catalogue with complex boundaries without assuming a prior shape. This process can be repeated at different levels of resolution using finer grids, leading to a list of voids-in-voids and a proper description of void substructure.

2025-09-29, **Direct Collapse Black Hole Candidates from Decaying Dark Matter**, Yash Aggarwal et.al., [2509.25325v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25325v1)

 Injecting 1-13.6 eV photons into the early universe can suppress the molecular hydrogen abundance and alter the star formation history dramatically enough to produce direct collapse black holes. These, in turn, could explain the recently observed population of puzzling high-redshift supermassive black holes that appear to require super-Eddington accretion. We show that axion dark matter decay in the intergalactic medium can account for this energy injection. We use a single zone model of the gas core and semi-analytically evolve its chemo-thermal properties to track the conditions for which the system becomes an atomic cooling halo-a necessary precursor for the production of heavy black hole seeds to explain the high-redshift black hole population. Windows of axions masses between 24.5-26.5 eV with photon couplings as low as $4\times 10^{-12}$/GeV may realize this atomic cooling halo condition. We highlight the significance of the band structure of molecular hydrogen on the effectiveness of this process and discuss estimates of the heavy seed population and prospects for testing this model.

 A physical understanding of galaxy formation and evolution benefits from an understanding of the connections between galaxies, their host dark matter halos, and their environments. In particular, interactions with more-massive neighbors can leave lasting imprints on both galaxies and their hosts. Distinguishing between populations of galaxies with differing environments and interaction histories is therefore essential for isolating the role of environment in shaping galaxy properties. We present a novel neural-network based method, which takes advantage of observable measures of a galaxy and its environment to recover whether it (1) is a central or a satellite, (2) has experienced an interaction with a more massive neighbor, and (3) is currently orbiting or infalling onto such a neighbor. We find that projected distances to, redshift separations of, and relative stellar masses with respect to a galaxy's 25 nearest neighbors are sufficient to distinguish central from satellite halos in $> 90\%$ of cases, with projection effects accounting for most classification errors. Our method also achieves high accuracy in recovering interaction history and orbital status, though the network struggles to distinguish between splashback and infalling systems in some cases due to the lack of velocity information. With careful treatment of the uncertainties introduced by projection and other observational limitations, this method offers a new avenue for studying the role of environment in galaxy formation and evolution.

 We study ultralight scalar fields with quadratic couplings to Standard-Model fermions and derive strong constraints from white-dwarf mass-radius data. Such couplings source scalar profiles inside compact stars, shift fermion masses, and can produce a new ground state of matter. We analyze couplings to electrons and to nucleons, incorporating composition and finite-temperature effects in white dwarf structure and equations of state. We identify two robust observables: (i) forbidden gaps - ranges of radii with no stable configurations - and (ii) characteristic shape distortions that drive white dwarf masses toward the Chandrasekhar limit (electron couplings) or shift the maximum mass (nucleon couplings). Confronting these predictions with precise measurements for Sirius B and Procyon B, together with the global white dwarf population, excludes large regions of unexplored parameter space and extends earlier QCD-axion-specific bounds to a broader class of scalar theories. Our stellar constraints rely only on sourcing and do not assume the scalar constitutes dark matter; where mass reductions are small, precision laboratory searches remain competitive. White-dwarf astrophysics thus provides a powerful, largely assumption-minimal probe of ultralight, quadratically coupled scalars.

2025-09-29, **Non-linear infusion of intrinsic alignment and source clustering: impact on non-Gaussian cosmic shear statistics**, J. Harnois-Déraps et.al., [2509.25166v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25166v1)

 Intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies is one of the key secondary signals to cosmic shear measurements, and must be modeled to interpret weak lensing data and infer the correct cosmology. There are large uncertainties in the physical description of IA, and analytical calculations are often out of reach for weak lensing statistics beyond two-point functions. We present here a set of six flexible IA models infused directly into weak lensing simulations, constructed from the mass shells, the projected tidal fields and, optionally, dark matter halo catalogues. We start with the non-linear linear alignment (NLA) and progressively sophisticate the galaxy bias and the tidal coupling models, including the commonly-used extended NLA (also known as the e-NLA or $\delta$-NLA) and the tidal torque (TT) models. We validate our methods with MCMC analyses from two-point shear statistics, then compute the impact on non-Gaussian cosmic shear probes from these catalogues as well as from reconstructed convergence maps. We find that the $\delta$-NLA model has by far the largest impact on most probes, at times more than twice the strength of the NLA. We also observe large differences between the IA models in under-dense regions, which makes minima, void profiles and lensing PDF the best probes for model rejection. Furthermore, our bias models allow us to separately study the source-clustering term for each of these probes, finding good agreement with the existing literature, and extending the results to these new probes. The third-order aperture mass statistics ($M^3\_{ap}$) and the integrated three-point functions are particularly sensitive to this when including low-redshift data, often exceeding a 20% impact on the data vector. Our IA models are straightforward to implement and rescale from a single simulated IA-infused galaxy catalogue, allowing for fast model exploration.

2025-09-29, **From Dark Radiation to Dark Energy: Unified Cosmological Evolution in K-essence Models**, Eladio Moreno et.al., [2509.25088v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25088v1)

 We study a class of Unified Dark Matter (UDM) models based on generalized K-essence, where a single scalar field with non-canonical kinetic terms accounts for dark radiation, dark matter, and dark energy. Starting from the purely kinetic Lagrangian proposed by Scherrer (2004), we extend the analysis to quadratic and exponential scalar potentials and explore their phenomenology. All models are implemented in a modified version of \texttt{Hi\\_CLASS} and confronted with data from \textit{Planck} 2018, DESI DR1, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The scenarios reproduce the full sequence of cosmic epochs: an early radiation-like phase, a matter-dominated era, and late-time accelerated expansion. The new models predict slightly higher values of the Hubble constant compared to $\Lambda$CDM, thereby partially alleviating the respective tensions from $\sim 4.4 \sigma$ to $\sim 3.4 \sigma$. The quadratic potential requires an ultralight mass that makes it effectively indistinguishable from the Scherrer solution. Overall, generalized K-essence provides a minimal and observationally viable realization of UDM, offering a unified description of the dark sector with distinctive signatures in both early- and late-time cosmology.

2025-09-29, **Vector dark matter production during inflation in the gradient-expansion formalism**, A. V. Lysenko et.al., [2509.24963v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24963v1)

 A massive vector field is a highly promising candidate for dark matter in the universe. A salient property of dark matter is its negligible or null coupling to ordinary matter, with the exception of gravitational interaction. This poses a significant challenge in producing the requisite amount of dark particles through processes within the Standard Model. In this study, we examine the production of a vector field during inflation due to its direct interaction with the inflaton field through kinetic and axion-like couplings as well as the field-dependent mass. The gradient-expansion formalism, previously proposed for massless Abelian gauge fields, is extended to include the longitudinal polarization of a massive vector field. We derive a coupled system of equations of motion for a set of bilinear functions of the vector field. This enables us to address the nonlinear dynamics of inflationary vector field production, including backreaction on background evolution. To illustrate this point, we apply our general formalism to a low-mass vector field whose kinetic and mass terms are coupled to the inflaton via the Ratra-type exponential function. The present study investigates the production of its transverse and longitudinal polarization components in a benchmark inflationary model with a quadratic inflaton potential. It has been demonstrated that pure mass coupling is able to enhance only the longitudinal components. By turning on also the kinetic coupling, one can get different scenarios. As the coupling function decreases, the primary contribution to the energy density is derived from the transverse polarizations of the vector field. Conversely, for an increasing coupling function, the longitudinal component becomes increasingly significant and rapidly propels the system into the strong backreaction regime.

 This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical study of a Schwarzschild-like Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) influenced by a new cloud of strings (NCS) and a dark matter halo (DMH) characterized by a Dehnen-type density profile. We analyze the geodesic motion of both massless and massive test particles, highlighting how the NCS and DMH parameters affect the effective potentials, photon spheres, circular orbits, BH shadow, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of test particles. Additionally, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of the BH in an extended phase space by deriving key quantities, such as the Hawking temperature, the equation of state (EoS), Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and the specific heat capacity. Our results show that the presence of NCS and DMH induces significant modifications in both the dynamical and thermodynamical behavior of the BH, including shifts in the Hawking-Page transition and divergences in heat capacity, thereby reshaping the phase structure of the BH.

 The $f(Q,C)$ theory, which extends symmetric teleparallel gravity by including the boundary term $C$ in addition to the non-metricity scalar $Q$, provides a unifying framework that encompasses both $f(Q)$ and $f(\mathring{R})$ gravities. In this work, we develop a comprehensive dynamical system analysis of $f(Q,C)$ cosmology formulated within the non-coincident affine connection branches. Unlike the coincident case, these branches introduce a dynamical degree of freedom that significantly enriches the cosmological phase space. We show that even for simple power-law forms of the Lagrangian, the theory accommodates a broad spectrum of cosmic scenarios, including successive pressureless matter eras, stiff-matter phases between early inflation and dark matter domination, and late-time acceleration. Our analysis demonstrates that the Universe can naturally evolve from an initial de Sitter phase to a matter-dominated epoch and subsequently to a final de Sitter attractor, consistent with the observed thermal history. These results highlight the role of the dynamical connection in shaping cosmic evolution and underline the potential of $f(Q,C)$ gravity as a viable alternative framework for addressing outstanding issues in modern cosmology.

2025-09-29, **Focusing the Axion Wind with Ferrite Flux Concentrators**, Christina Gao et.al., [2509.24553v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24553v1)

 Axion dark matter may couple to fermion spins through an effective oscillating magnetic field, the ``axion wind". Existing approaches for detecting axion wind via axion-electron coupling $g\_{ae}$ face sensitivity limitations due to the extremely weak pseudomagnetic field generated, typically a few times $10^{-18}$ tesla for $g\_{ae} \sim 10^{-10}$. We propose to use ferrimagnetic flux concentrators to amplify the pseudomagnetic field into a genuine magnetic field, which can then be measured using general precision magnetometry techniques. This greatly expands the experimental possibilities beyond conventional methods that rely on detecting small transverse magnetic fields from spin precession induced by axion wind. Here we utilize the libration mode of a levitated ferromagnet, which can achieve sub-femtotesla sensitivity, enabling detection of axion-electron coupling strengths $g\_{ae} \lesssim 10^{-11}$ in the frequency range $1-500$ Hz.

 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will be the next-generation major ground-based gamma-ray observatory. It will be made up of two large arrays of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), with one site in the Northern hemisphere (La Palma, Canary Islands) and one in the Southern (Paranal, Chile). CTAO aims to offer great improvement in energetic and angular resolution with respect to current IACT systems, spanning a photon energy range from 20 GeV to 300 TeV, as well as a significantly larger effective area and full-sky coverage. Besides a percentage of observational time available for external proposals, making it the first open gamma-ray observatory, the core observational program of CTAO is organized in several Key Science Projects. A significant amount of time will be devoted to dark matter (e.g. WIMPs, axion-like particles) and fundamental physics studies from a variety of targets, including the Milky Way's Galactic centre, dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and extragalactic objects such as blazars. In this contribution, an overview of CTAO's main features is provided, with a focus on its capabilities to investigate these yet unanswered questions of modern physics.

2025-09-29, **Observational Evidence for Spin Alignment Between Galaxy Groups and Their Central Galaxies**, Peng Wang et.al., [2509.24278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24278v1)

 We present a systematic observational study of the spin alignment between galaxy groups and their central galaxies using a large spectroscopic sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Unlike previous studies based on morphology or major axis alignment, we use spin as a direct, dynamically motivated probe. To match the limitations of observational data, the group spin, central-galaxy spin, and alignment angle are defined and measured in projection on the sky plane. By applying two novel spin estimators for galaxy groups, we find strong statistical evidence for a preferential alignment, with a mean projected angle of $34.17^\circ \pm 0.29^\circ$, significantly deviating from random expectation at $37.77\sigma$. This alignment signal persists across a wide range of group and galaxy properties, but its strength is modulated by mass, morphology, and color. Specifically, we find that more massive groups and more massive central galaxies exhibit stronger alignment. Furthermore, elliptical central galaxies show stronger alignment than spirals, and bluer central galaxies are more strongly aligned than redder ones. Our results suggest a close dynamical link between the spin of central galaxies and their host groups, modulated by their physical properties and star formation history. These results provide new insights into the dynamical connection between central galaxies and their host dark matter halos.

2025-09-29, **Collisional Baryon-Dominated Dwarf Galaxies: A New Probe of Bursty Feedback and Dark Matter Physics**, Yi-Ying Wang et.al., [2509.24270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24270v1)

 High-velocity collisions between gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies present a promising formation channel for baryon-dominated dwarf galaxies (BDDGs). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the progenitors' baryonic binding energy, $\|E\_{\rm bind}\|$, critically controls the outcome. Repeated potential fluctuations, e.g., from bursty feedback, inject energy and reduce $\|E\_{\rm bind}\|$ by $\approx 15\%$, yielding fewer but substantially more massive BDDGs. By contrast, elastic self-interacting dark matter produces comparable cores without lowering $\|E\_{\rm bind}\|$, resulting in negligible effect. This provides a novel way to distinguish between two leading galactic core formation channels, i.e., the baryon feedback and elastic dark matter self-interaction. Among 15 paired simulation runs, 13 show higher BDDG masses in the weakened-binding case, and about two thirds exhibit $>100\%$ mass enhancements. The simulations also predict systematically lower gas fractions due to sustained post-collision star formation, yielding a clean observational signature. Upcoming wide-field imaging (CSST, LSST), HI surveys (FAST), and kinematic follow-up will be crucial to test this scenario.

2025-09-30, **Exploring cosmological constraints on galaxy formation time**, Agripino Sousa-Neto et.al., [2509.26611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26611v1)

 The Universe consists of a variety of objects that formed at different epochs, leading to variations in the formation time which represents the time elapsed from the onset of structure formation until the formation time of a particular object. In this work, we present two approaches to reconstruct and constrain the galaxy formation time $t\_f(z)$ using non-parametric reconstruction methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GP) and High-performance Symbolic Regression (SR). Our analysis uses age estimates of 32 old passive galaxies and the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and considers two different values of the Hubble constant $H\_0$ from the SH0ES and Planck Collaborations. When adopting the $\Lambda$CDM model and the GP reconstructions, we find $\left<t\_f\right>=0.72\_{-0.16}^{+0.14}$ Gyr (SH0ES) and $\left<t\_f\right>=1.26\_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$ Gyr (Planck). Without considering a specific cosmological model, we obtain $\left<t\_f\right>=0.71 \pm {0.19}$ Gyr (SH0ES) and $\left<t\_f\right> = 1.35\_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$ Gyr (Planck). Similar values are obtained from the SR reconstructions, with both methods (GP and SR) indicating the same behavior regarding the time evolution of $t\_f(z)$. The results also show significant differences in the formation time from SH0ES and Planck values, highlighting the impact of the $H\_0$ tension on the cosmological estimates of $t\_f(z)$. In particular, the different approaches used in the analysis agree with each other, demonstrating the robustness and consistency of our results. Overall, this study suggests that galaxies have different evolutionary timescales and that $t\_f$ is not constant, with noticeable variations at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 0.5$).

2025-09-30, **Tests of Evolving Dark Energy with Geometric Probes of the Late Late-Time Universe**, Kunhao Zhong et.al., [2509.26480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26480v1)

 Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have shown a strong statistical preference for a time-evolving dark energy model over $\Lambda$CDM when combining BAO, CMB, and supernova (SN) data. We investigate the robustness of this conclusion by isolating geometric information in weak lensing measurements from the DES Year 3 survey and combining it with different datasets. We introduce a hyperparameter, $\Omega\_{\rm m}^{\rm growth}$, to decouple the growth contribution from the lensing 2-point correlation and thus bypass the possible effect of the $\sigma\_8$ tension in our analysis. We then combine with the late-time geometric probes provided by BAO and SN, along with CMB primary data. The preference for evolving dark energy is consistent with the DESI-DR2 findings: when combining BAO, primary CMB, and weak lensing data, the $w\_0w\_a$CDM is preferred at about the $3\sigma$ significance. However, when we add SN, the result is sensitive to the choice of data: if we leave out $z<0.1$ SN data in the analysis, as a test of the effect of inhomogeneous calibration, we obtain a statistical significance below $2\sigma$ for time evolving dark energy. Indeed, the high-z only SN data \textbf{lowers} the evidence for evolving dark energy in all the data combinations we have examined. This underscores the importance of improved SN samples at low redshift and of alternative data combinations. We show that cosmic shear measurements with LSST Year 1 data will provide comparable power to current SN data. We discuss other low-redshift probes provided by lensing and galaxy clustering to test for evolving dark energy.

2025-09-30, **Stereo observations of CTA 1 with SST-1M**, Bastien Lacave et.al., [2509.26068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26068v1)

 CTA~1 is a composite supernova remnant featuring a shell structure and an inner Pulsar Wind Nebula. The shell is visible in the radio band, while Fermi has detected the radio-quiet pulsar PSR J0007+7303 at its core. Gamma-ray detectors such as LHAASO and VERITAS have detected TeV emission in the vicinity of the pulsar. However, the derived SEDs from LHAASO WCDA and VERITAS show significant discrepancies, which could be due to a complicated energy-dependent morphology not accounted for in the spectral analysis, and different angular resolution of the two experiments. CTA~1 has been a target for dedicated observations by the SST-1M telescopes, a pair of small-sized Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) capable of operating in both mono and stereo modes. Located at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory in Czech Republic, these telescopes are sensitive to the high energy range of the gamma-ray spectrum, spanning from 1 to 300 TeV. To investigate the very high-energy emission of CTA~1, the SST-1Ms have accumulated approximately 30 hours of selected observations, aiming to further constrain the characteristics of the source's high energy emission, and to shed some light into the discrepancy between different experiments.

2025-09-30, **Empirical Validation: Investigating the $Λ_s $CDM Model with new DESI BAO Observations**, Manish Yadav et.al., [2509.26049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26049v1)

 The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, offering an elegant and successful framework for interpreting a wide range of cosmological observations. However, the rise of high-precision datasets has revealed statistically significant tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S\_8$ discrepancy, which challenge the completeness of this standard model. In this context, we explore the $\Lambda\_{\rm s}$CDM model-an extension of $\Lambda$CDM featuring a single additional parameter, $z\_\dagger$, corresponding to a sign-switching cosmological constant. This minimal modification aims to alleviate key observational tensions without compromising the model's overall coherence. Recent findings present in the literature indicate that the $\Lambda\_{\rm s}$CDM model not only provides a better fit to Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data for $z\_\dagger < 2.3$, but also accommodates both the SH0ES measurement of $H\_0$ and the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface when 2D BAO data are included. We present a comprehensive analysis combining the full Planck 2018 CMB data, the Pantheon Type Ia Supernovae sample, and the recently released Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our finding reveal that the Preliminary DESI results, a possible $3.9\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM expectations, reinforce the importance of exploring such dynamic dark energy frameworks. In sum, our study underscores the potential of $\Lambda\_{\rm s}$CDM to reconcile multiple cosmological tensions and sheds light on the role of upcoming high-precision observations in reshaping our understanding of the universe's expansion history and the nature of dark energy.

2025-09-30, **The Formation of Neutron Star Systems through Electron-capture Supernovae: A Review**, Bo Wang et.al., [2509.25915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25915v1)

 It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit, leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. However, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (including He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (including the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects, and some observational constraints, etc. We also discuss the formation of double NSs through NS+He star binaries, in which the He star companion experiences an EC-SN. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.

 Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are astrophysical phenomena arising when stars are disrupted by supermassive black holes. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), with its unprecedented depth and cadence, will detect thousands of TDEs, motivating the need for robust photometric classifiers capable of efficiently distinguishing these events from other extragalactic transients. We aim to develop and validate a machine learning pipeline for photometric TDE identification in LSST-scale datasets. Our classifier is designed to provide high precision and recall, enabling the construction of reliable TDE catalogs for multi-messenger follow-up and statistical studies. Using the second Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC2) dataset, we fit Gaussian Processes (GP) to light curves for feature extraction (e.g., color, rise/fade times, GP length scales). We then train and tune boosted decision-tree models (XGBoost) with a custom scoring function emphasizing high-precision recovery of TDEs. Our pipeline is tested on a diverse simulation of transient and variable events, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and superluminous supernovae. We achieve high precision (up to 95%) while maintaining competitive recall (about 72%) for TDEs, with minimal contamination from non-TDE classes. Key predictive features include post-peak colors and GP hyperparameters, reflecting characteristic timescales and spectral behaviors of TDEs. Our photometric classifier provides a practical and scalable approach to identifying TDEs in forthcoming LSST data. By capturing essential color and temporal properties through GP-based feature extraction, it enables efficient construction of clean TDE candidate samples.

2025-09-30, **Turbulent Magnetic Fields and Molecular Cloud Interactions in the Supernova Remnant G1.9+0.3**, Moeri Tao et.al., [2509.25833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25833v1)

 We present on results of a spatially resolved spectral analysis of G1.9+0.3, the youngest known supernova remnant in the Galaxy. The X-ray spectra are well described by synchrotron emission from a power-law electron distribution with an exponential cutoff. We found a cutoff energy $\epsilon\_0 \sim 1 ~ \rm{keV}$ in both the radio bright rim and the X-ray bright rims. In the loss-limited case, the cutoff energy depends on the shock velocity $v\_{\rm{sh}}$ and the Bohm factor $\eta$, following the relation $\epsilon\_0 \propto v\_{\rm{sh}}^2 \eta^{-1} $. Our analysis shows that $\eta$ ranges from 2 to 4 in the radio rim and from 12 to 15 in the X-ray rims. This suggests that the magnetic field in the radio rim is more turbulent than in the X-ray rims. The presence of CO clouds along the radio rim likely contributes to this difference. Interaction between the shock and these clouds can slow the shock down and generate turbulent eddies. The resulting turbulence eddies can amplify the magnetic field. We propose that the strong radio emission from the radio rim is primarily due to this amplified magnetic field. In contrast, a CO cloud located in the south-west appears to lie in the foreground, as indicated by its low turbulence and the absence of shock deceleration.

2025-09-30, **Updated observational constraints on $φ$CDM dynamical dark energy cosmological models**, Chan-Gyung Park et.al., [2509.25812v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25812v1)

 We present updated observational constraints on the spatially flat $\phi$CDM model, where dark energy is described by a minimally coupled scalar field $\phi$ with an inverse power-law potential $V=V\_0 \phi^{-\alpha}$. Using Planck 2018 CMB temperature, polarization (P18), and lensing power spectra (lensing), along with a compilation of non-CMB data including baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, Hubble parameter, and growth rate measurements, we constrain $\phi$CDM and $\phi$CDM+$A\_L$ models where $A\_L$ is the CMB lensing consistency parameter. The scalar field parameter $\alpha$, which governs dark energy dynamics, is more tightly constrained by non-CMB data than by CMB data alone. For the full dataset, we obtain $\alpha = 0.055 \pm 0.041$ in the $\phi$CDM model and $\alpha = 0.095 \pm 0.056$ in the $\phi$CDM+$A\_L$ model, mildly favoring evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant by $1.3\sigma$ and $1.7\sigma$. The Hubble constant is $H\_0=67.55\_{-0.46}^{+0.53}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $\phi$CDM model, consistent with median statistics and some local determinations, but in tension with other local determinations. The constraints for matter density and clustering amplitude ($\Omega\_m = 0.3096 \pm 0.0055$, $\sigma\_8 = 0.8013\_{-0.0067}^{+0.0077}$) of the flat $\phi$CDM model statistically agree with $\Lambda$CDM model values. Allowing $A\_L$ to vary reduces tensions between CMB and non-CMB data, although we find $A\_L = 1.105 \pm 0.037$, $2.8\sigma$ higher than unity, consistent with the excess smoothing seen in Planck data. Model comparison using AIC and DIC indicates that the $\phi$CDM model provides a fit comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, with the $\phi$CDM+$A\_L$ slightly preferred. Overall, while the $\Lambda$CDM model remains an excellent fit, current data leave open the possibility of mildly evolving quintessence-like dynamical dark energy.

2025-09-29, **Characterizing the host galaxies and delay times of Ca-rich gap transients vs 91bg-like SNe and normal Type Ia SNe**, Peter Scherbak et.al., [2509.25577v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25577v1)

 Calcium-rich gap transients are a faint, fast-evolving class of supernovae that show strong nebular Ca emission lines. Their progenitor systems are uncertain, but they are often associated with old and quiescent host galaxies. In this work, we compare the properties of the hosts of hydrogen-poor Ca-rich gap transients to the hosts of 3 other classes of supernova (SNe): normal Type Ia, 91bg-like, and Type II. We use data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Census of the Local Universe (CLU) experiment to build up our 4 SNe samples and identify the host galaxies. A combination of precomputed host properties from the CLU catalog and those derived from SED fitting are used to characterize each host's stellar mass, star formation rate, and specific star formation rate (sSFR). We find that the hosts of Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe occupy a similar parameter space of mass and sSFR, and are more massive and quiescent compared to the hosts of Type Ia and Type II SNe. Additionally, we construct delay time distributions (DTDs) for our 4 samples, finding that Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe have the longest peak delay times $\sim 10^4$ Myr, compared to the peak delay times of Type Ia SNe ($\sim 10^3$ Myr) and Type II SNe ($\sim 10$ Myr). The similarity of host environment and DTDs for Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe motivates further analysis of the relationship of these two transient classes.

 The delay in arrival time of the multiple images of gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) can be related to the present-day expansion rate of the universe, $H\_{0}$. Despite their rarity, Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin-LSST) is expected to discover tens of galaxy-scale glSNe per year, many of which will not be resolved due to their compact nature. Follow-up from ground- and space-based telescopes will be necessary to estimate time delays to sufficient precision for meaningful $H\_{0}$ constraints. We present the Glimpse model (GausSN Light curve Inference of Magnifications and Phase Shifts, Extended) that estimates time delays with resolved and unresolved observations together for the first time, while simultaneously accounting for dust and microlensing effects. With this method, we explore best follow-up strategies for glSNe observed by Rubin-LSST. For unresolved systems on the dimmest end of detectability by Rubin-LSST, having peak i-band magnitudes of 22-24 mag, the time delays are measured to as low as 0.7 day uncertainty with 6-8 epochs of resolved space-based observations in each of 4-6 optical and NIR filters. For systems of similar brightness that are resolved by ground-based facilities, time delays are consistently constrained to 0.5-0.8 day precision with 6 epochs in 4 optical and NIR filters of space-based observations or 8 epochs in 4 optical filters of deep ground-based observations. This work improves on previous time-delay estimation methods and demonstrates that glSNe time delays of $\sim10-20$ days can be measured to sufficient precision for competitive $H\_{0}$ estimates in the Rubin-LSST era.

 Early light curves of many core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are thought to be powered by the interaction of the shock wave with optically thick extended material, either a bound envelope or preexplosion ejected circumstellar matter (CSM). We analytically analyze the early emission produced by a shock with velocity $v$ traversing a material of mass $M\_\mathrm{e}$ and opacity $\kappa$ extending to radius $R\_\mathrm{e}$, and show the emission varies qualitatively with varying $\tau\_\mathrm{e}=\kappa\!M\_\mathrm{e}/(4\pi\!R\_\mathrm{e}^2)$: For $\tau\_\mathrm{e}\gg\!c/v$ a shock breakout occurs near $R\_\mathrm{e}$ producing an ``edge breakout"- a UV-dominated breakout burst followed by ``cooling emission" of the shock-heated material; for $\tau\_\mathrm{e}\lesssim\!c/v$ a ``wind breakout" occurs- the breakout pulse is prolonged and followed by extended emission shifting from UV to X-ray as the shock becomes collisionless. We derive the dependence on $\{v,\kappa,M\_\mathrm{e},R\_\mathrm{e}\}$ of the duration and luminosity characterizing the different emission phases, and show that current observations typically do not allow inference of all parameters. In particular, since the optical bands lie in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of radiation emitted during the cooling phase, the observed cooling luminosity depends weakly on radius, $\propto\!R\_\mathrm{e}^{1/4}$, leading to $1-2$ orders of magnitude uncertainty in its inferred value. This suggests, e.g., that the common day-scale light curve features in Stripped-Envelope SNe do not necessarily imply material extending to $R\_\mathrm{e}\sim10^3\!R\_\odot$ and are often consistent with low-mass $R\_\mathrm{e}\sim\!10^2\!R\_\odot$ bound envelopes. Early multiband coverage (especially in UV/X-ray) can break these degeneracies; the forthcoming \emph{ULTRASAT} UV mission will allow inferring the properties of extended material around the population of SNe progenitors.

 We present the implementation and testing of a subgrid non-explosive pre-supernova (NEPS) feedback module for the COLIBRE model of galaxy formation. The NEPS module incorporates three key physical processes sourced by young, massive stars that act immediately following star formation: momentum injection from stellar winds and radiation pressure, and thermal energy from photoheating in HII regions. The age- and metallicity-dependent energy and momentum budgets are derived from BPASS stellar population models and are coupled self-consistently to the local gas properties. We test the model using a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated, unstable gaseous disks at various numerical resolutions (gas particle masses in the range $10^4-10^6$ $\rm M\_{\odot}$). We find that the NEPS module successfully regulates star formation by providing pressure support that prevents catastrophic gas collapse. This regulation improves the numerical convergence of star formation rates and disk structure. In our model, feedback from HII regions is the dominant regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial synergy with subsequent supernova feedback; NEPS feedback pre-processes the interstellar medium, creating a more homogeneous environment that moderates the effect of explosive feedback from supernova events. Our NEPS module thus provides a physically motivated and numerically robust framework that mitigates resolution-dependent artefacts and promotes self-regulated galaxy growth.

2025-09-29, **The Hubble tension as an effect of the renormalization of fundamental constants and cosmological parameters**, Fabio Briscese et.al., [2509.25287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25287v1)

 In this Letter we propose an interpretation of the Hubble tension as an effect of the scale-running of cosmological parameters and fundamental constants, as the Newton's constant $G$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Namely, the tension between $H\_0$ measurements by CMB and Supernovae observations would be a consequence of the fact that the value of $H\_0$ depends (due to the running of $G$ and $\Lambda$) on the scale at which it is measured. Indeed, the two different values of the Hubble parameter today correspond to the two different cosmological scales at which Supernovae and CMB measurements probe our universe. We discuss some possible theoretical scenarios in which the running of $G$ and $\Lambda$ can occur. We stress that one should interpret such a running as a scale-dependence of the cosmological parameters and fundamental constants at the same time rather than a time dependence, as it is usually considered in the literature.

 Understanding the origin and evolution of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars is key to tracing the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment. We investigate how realistic 3D radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) model atmospheres affect carbon abundances in CEMP stars and implications for their classification and Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We focus on biases from traditional 1D hydrostatic models. We use the M3DIS code to compute 3D RHD model atmospheres for main-sequence and sub-giant stars over a wide range of metallicities and carbon enhancements. Synthetic spectra of the CH G-band are calculated with 3D radiative transfer and compared to spectra from classical 1D MARCS models. We derive abundance corrections and apply them to a large SAGA database sample to quantify effects on the carbon abundance distribution and CEMP classification. Our new 3D CEMP models predict cooler upper atmospheric layers than in 1D models, resulting in stronger CH absorption and lower inferred carbon abundances by up to -0.9 dex at the lowest metallicities. Carbon enhancement in the atmosphere itself increases molecular opacities and leads to radiative re-heating, partly offsetting adiabatic cooling in 3D models and reducing 3D-1D abundance corrections. Applying these corrections lowers the CEMP fraction by up to 20% below [Fe/H]=-3 and alters the relative contribution of CEMP sub-classes. The fraction of CEMP-no stars increases while the number of CEMP-r/s stars decreases, due to the downward revision of absolute carbon abundances. These changes bring the Galactic carbon distribution into better agreement with GCE models assuming a 20% contribution from faint supernovae. Realistic model atmospheres are essential to reliably reconstruct the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment history.

2025-09-29, **Inferring Cosmological Parameters with Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Networks**, Hai Siong Tan et.al., [2509.24327v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24327v1)

 We examine the use of a novel variant of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to predict cosmological parameters from recent supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) datasets. Our machine learning framework generates uncertainty estimates for target variables and the inferred unknown parameters of the underlying PDE descriptions. Built upon a hybrid of the principles of Evidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior distribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent based training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al. 2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne Ia distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and mutual consistency among the standard $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\Lambda\_s$CDM models. Unlike previous results arising from the standard approach of minimizing an appropriate $\chi^2$ function, the posterior distributions for parameters in various models trained purely on Pantheon$+$ data were found to be largely contained within the $2\sigma$ contours of their counterparts trained on BAO data. Their posterior medians for $h\_0$ were within about $2\sigma$ of one another, indicating that our machine learning-guided approach provides a different measure of the Hubble tension.
