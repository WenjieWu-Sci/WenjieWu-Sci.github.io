2023-08-16, **Performance Studies of the Acoustic Module for the IceCube Upgrade**, Charlotte Benning et.al., [2308.08506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08506v1)

 The IceCube Upgrade will augment the existing IceCube Neutrino Observatory by deploying 700 additional optical sensor modules and calibration devices within its center at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 km in the Antarctic ice. One goal of the Upgrade is to improve the positioning calibration of the optical sensors to increase the angular resolution for neutrino directional reconstruction. An acoustic calibration system will be deployed to explore the capability of achieving this using trilateration of propagation times of acoustic signals. Ten Acoustic Modules (AM) capable of sending and receiving acoustic signals with frequencies from 5 to 30 kHz will be installed within the detector volume. Additionally, compact acoustic sensors inside 15 optical sensor modules will complement the acoustic calibration system. With this system, we aim for an accuracy of a few tens of cm to localize the Acoustic Modules and sensors. Due to the longer attenuation length of sound compared to light within the ice, acoustic position calibration is especially interesting for the upcoming IceCube-Gen2 detector, which will have a string spacing of around 240 m. In this contribution we present an overview of the technical design of the Acoustic Module as well as results of performance tests with a first complete prototype.

2023-08-16, **Comments on "On the Dirac-Majorana neutrinos distinction in four-body decays" (arXiv:2305.14140 [hep-ph])**, C. S. Kim et.al., [2308.08464v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08464v1)

 In arXiv:2305.14140 [hep-ph] the authors analyze the radiative leptonic decay $\ell^- \to \nu\_\ell \, \overline{\nu}\_{\ell'} \, \ell^{\prime -} \, \gamma$ to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana nature of neutrinos. They utilize the back-to-back kinematics for this purpose, a special kinematic configuration which we first proposed in our paper arXiv:2106.11785 [hep-ph]. However, their analysis suffers from two fundamental issues: (1) anti-symmetrization of their amplitude and (2) their study of the special back-to-back configuration. This makes their conclusion and comments invalid and untenable.

2023-08-16, **Neutrinos and Asteroseismology of Stars over the Helium Flash**, Diogo Capelo et.al., [2308.08282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08282v1)

 The helium flash, occurring in stars of 0.6-2.0 M$\_\odot$ at the end of the red giant branch, is not observable via optical means due to the energy of the process being used to lift the core out of degeneracy. Neutrinos, which are linked to the ignition of reactions triggered during the flash and serve as the only cooling process in the inert core, can help characterize changes in internal structure. In this work, we create 18 stellar models across three mass and six metallicity values, chosen in the context of the stellar abundance problem, to compare the evolutionary path up to and probe the helium flash by conducting a detailed study of neutrino emission throughout this crucial phase of stellar evolution. We demonstrate how thermal neutrino emissions could have an imprint on global asteroseismic parameters and use them as an additional tool to infer the impact of compositional changes. We find that a precision of 0.3 $\mu$Hz in the determination of $\Delta \nu$ is enough to distinguish between between the two most prominent solar composition models and confirm that asteroseismic observation can be enough to classify a star as undergoing the process of helium subflashes. We also predict nuclear neutrino emission fluxes and their evolution for all relevant sources.

2023-08-16, **Chiral kinetic theory with self-energy corrections and neutrino spin Hall effect**, Naoki Yamamoto et.al., [2308.08257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08257v1)

 We systematically derive the chiral kinetic theory for chiral fermions with collisions, including the self-energy corrections, from quantum field theories. We find that the Wigner functions and chiral kinetic equations receive both the classical and quantum corrections from the self-energies and their spacetime gradients. We also apply this formalism to study non-equilibrium neutrino transport due to the interaction with thermalized electrons, as realized in core-collapse supernovae. We derive neutrino currents along magnetic fields and neutrino spin Hall effect induced by temperature and chemical potential gradients of electrons at first order in the Fermi constant $G\_{\rm F}$ for anisotropic neutrino distributions.

2023-08-16, **Galactic and Extragalactic Analysis of the Astrophysical Muon Neutrino Flux with 12.3 years of IceCube Track Data**, Philipp FÃ¼rst et.al., [2308.08233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08233v1)

 The Ice Cube Neutrino Observatory has been measuring an isotropic astrophysical neutrino flux in multiple detection channels for almost a decade. Galactic diffuse emission, which arises from the interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium, is an expected signal in IceCube. The superposition of an extragalactic flux and a galactic flux results in directional structure and variations in the spectrum. In this work, we use 12.3 years of high-purity muon-neutrino induced muon track data to perform a dedicated search for this galactic emission, combined with a spectral measurement of the isotropic astrophysical neutrino flux. To distinguish a galactic component from the dominant atmospheric and isotropic astrophysical components, the precise directional information available for muon tracks is fully utilized in a three-dimensional forward folding likelihood fit. We test a state-of-the-art model prediction of galactic diffuse emission based on recent cosmic ray data (CRINGE). We fit this prediction as a template scaled by a factor $\Psi\_{\mathrm{CRINGE}}$, and find $2.9\pm 1.1 \times \Psi\_{\mathrm{CRINGE}}$ with a significance of $2.7\sigma$ in an energy range between 400 GeV and 60 TeV in the Northern Sky.

2023-08-16, **Effect of Spin-Dependent Short-Range Correlations on Nuclear Matrix Elements for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay of $^{48}$Ca**, S. Sarkar et.al., [2308.08216v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08216v1)

 The neutrinoless double beta decay is a pivotal weak nuclear process that holds the potential to unveil the Majorana nature of neutrinos and predict their absolute masses. In this study, we delve into examining the impact of spin-dependent short-range correlations (SRC) on the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for the light neutrino-exchange mechanism in neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of $^{48}$Ca, employing an extensive interacting nuclear shell model. All computations are performed employing the effective shell model Hamiltonian GXPF1A, encompassing the entire $fp$ model space through the closure approximation. Our investigation examines the NMEs' dependencies on factors such as the number of intermediate states, coupled spin-parity attributes of neutrons and protons, neutrino momentum, inter-nucleon separation, and closure energy. This scrutiny is performed with respect to both the conventional Jastrow-type approach of SRC, employing various parameterizations, and the spin-dependent SRC paradigm. Our findings illuminate a discernible distinction in NMEs induced by spin-dependent SRC, differing by approximately 10-20\% from those computed through the conventional Jastrow-type SRC, incorporating distinct parameterizations.

2023-08-16, **Detecting Ultra-light Dark Matter with Stimulated Annihilation**, Yuanlin Gong et.al., [2308.08477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08477v1)

 Ultra-light Dark Matter (ULDM) is one of the most promising DM candidates. In the presence of background photon radiation, the annihilation rate of the ULDM can be greatly enhanced due to the Bose enhancement. We propose to utilize such stimulated annihilation to probe the ULDM by emitting a beam of radio into the space. This could lead to a distinctive reflected electromagnetic wave with an angular frequency equal to the ULDM mass. We show that low-frequency radio telescopes, such as LOFAR, UTR-2 and ngBOLO, can offer a new avenue of detecting this signal, especially for the Earth halo model. With a power of 50 MW emitter, the expected limits could be several orders of magnitude stronger than that from Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the ULDM mass $m\_\phi$ range, $2.07 \times 10^{-8}\mathrm{~eV} \sim 4.5 \times 10^{-8}\mathrm{~eV}$.

2023-08-16, **Gravitational Wave Emission from a Cosmic String Loop, I: Global Case**, Jorge Baeza-Ballesteros et.al., [2308.08456v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08456v1)

 We study the simultaneous decay of global string loops into scalar particles (massless and massive modes) and gravitational waves (GWs). Using field theory simulations in flat space-time of %isolated loops with initial length $\sim 80-1700$ times their core width, we determine the power emitted by a loop into scalar particles, $P\_{\varphi}$, and GWs, $P\_{\rm GW}$, and characterize the loop-decay timescale as a function of its initial length, energy and angular momentum. We quantify infrared and ultraviolet lattice dependencies of our results. For all type of loops and initial conditions considered, GW emission is always suppressed compared to particles as $P\_{\rm GW}/P\_{\varphi} \approx \mathcal{O}(10)(v/m\_\text{p})^2\ll 1$, where $v$ is the vacuum expectation value associated with string formation. Our results suggest that the GW background from a global string network, such as in dark matter axion scenarios, will be highly suppressed.

2023-08-16, **Galaxy Rotation Curve Fitting Using Machine Learning Tools**, Carlos R. ArgÃ¼elles et.al., [2308.08420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08420v1)

 Galaxy rotation curve (RC) fitting is an important technique which allows the placement of constraints on different kinds of dark matter (DM) halo models. In the case of non-phenomenological DM profiles with no analytic expressions, the art of finding RC best-fits including the full baryonic $+$ DM free parameters can be difficult and time-consuming. In the present work, we use a gradient descent method used in the backpropagation process of training a neural network, to fit the so-called Grand Rotation Curve of the Milky Way (MW) ranging from $\sim$1 pc all the way to $\sim$$10^5$ pc. We model the mass distribution of our Galaxy including a bulge (inner $+$ main), a disk, and a fermionic dark matter (DM) halo known as the Ruffini-Arg\"uelles-Rueda (RAR) model. This is a semi-analytical model built from first-principle physics such as (quantum) statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, whose more general density profile has a dense core -- diluted halo morphology with no analytic expression. As shown recently and further verified here, the dark and compact fermion-core can work as an alternative to the central black hole in SgrA* when including data at milliparsec scales from the S-cluster stars. Thus, we show the ability of this state-of-the-art machine learning tool in providing the best-fit parameters to the overall MW RC in the $10^{-2}$--$10^5$ pc range, in a few hours of CPU time.

2023-08-16, **A radio-frequency WIMP search with the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey**, Natasha Lavis et.al., [2308.08351v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08351v1)

 Radio-frequency, indirect dark matter searches have recently been gaining prevalence, due to the high sensitivity and resolution capabilities of the new generation of radio interferometers. MeerKAT is currently one of the most sensitive instruments of its kind, making it ideal for indirect dark matter searches. By making use of publicly available data from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey we are able to use both the observed diffuse synchrotron emission and non-detections to constrain the WIMP dark matter parameter space. In addition to a subset of generic WIMP annihilation channels, we probe the dark matter candidate within the 2HDM+S particle physics model, which was developed as an explanation for anomalies observed in the Large Hadron Collider data from runs 1 and 2. By undertaking a statistical analysis of the radio flux densities within galaxy clusters we are able to exclude the thermal relic value for WIMP masses $< \, \sim 800 $ GeV for annihilation into bottom quarks. This is competitive with the best constraints in the current literature.

2023-08-16, **First results of the SUPAX Experiment: Probing Dark Photons**, Tim Schneemann et.al., [2308.08337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08337v1)

 We show the first results of a new cavity based haloscope searching for dark photons with masses around $34~\mu\text{eV}$. Dark photons are hypothetical vector particles and a compelling dark matter candidate. Having the same quantum numbers as photons a kinematic mixing between both is expected, leading to conversions from dark photons to standard model photons, where the photon frequency depends on the dark photon mass. For wavelengths in the microwave regime resonators are typically used to enhance the signal. A new experiment is setup at the University of Mainz. In this paper we present the initial results from the new setup searching for dark photons utilising a 8.3 GHz copper cavity at LHe temperatures. Limits on the kinetic mixing parameter $\chi < (6.20 \pm 3.15^\text{(exp.)} \pm 9.65^\text{(SG)}) \cdot 10^{-14}$ at 95\% CL are set at a single frequency as proof of concept. Finally the next steps of the experiment and expected sensitivity are detailed.

2023-08-16, **Electron transfer efficiency in liquid xenon across THGEM holes**, G. MartÃ­nez-Lema et.al., [2308.08314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08314v1)

 Dual-phase liquid-xenon time projection chambers (LXe TPCs) deploying a few tonnes of liquid are presently leading the search for WIMP dark matter. Scaling these detectors to 10-fold larger fiducial masses, while improving their sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs presents difficult challenges in detector design. Several groups are considering a departure from current schemes, towards either single-phase liquid-only TPCs, or dual-phase detectors where the electroluminescence region consists of patterned electrodes. Here, we discuss the possible use of Thick Gaseous Electron Multipliers (THGEMs) coated with a VUV photocathode and immersed in LXe as a building block in such designs. We focus on the transfer efficiencies of ionization electrons and photoelectrons emitted from the photocathode through the electrode holes, and show experimentally that efficiencies approaching 100 % can be achieved with realistic voltage settings. The observed voltage dependence of the transfer efficiencies is consistent with electron transport simulations once diffusion and charging-up effects are included.

2023-08-16, **GRDzhadzha: A code for evolving relativistic matter on analytic metric backgrounds**, Josu C. Aurrekoetxea et.al., [2308.08299v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08299v1)

 GRDzhadzha is an open-source code for relativistic simulations of matter fields on curved spacetimes that admit an analytic description (e.g. stationary black holes). It is based on the publicly available 3+1D numerical relativity code GRChombo. Such a description is valid where the density of the matter is small compared to the curvature scale of the spacetime, which is the case for many physical scenarios - for example, dark matter environments. The approach offers significant savings on memory and speed compared to running full numerical relativity simulations, since the metric variables and their derivatives are calculated analytically, and therefore are not evolved or stored on the grid. This brief paper introduces the code and gives details of some applications for which it has already been used.

2023-08-16, **Hidden Sector Dark Matter Arising from Breaking of $i \leftrightarrow -i$ Symmetry into Higgs Phases with Nonzero and Zero Higgs Vacuum Expectation**, Stephen L. Adler et.al., [2308.08107v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08107v1)

 We propose a scenario, motivated by but not exclusive to trace dynamics, in which emergent quantum theory takes the form of two sectors coupled gravitationally (or very weakly at some high unification scale), one sector with complex unit $i$ and the other sector with complex unit $-i$. I postulate that as a result of symmetries of the pre-quantum theory, in the absence of coupling the two sectors both have Higgs potentials that lie precisely at the boundary between phases with nonzero and zero Higgs vaccum expectation. Turning on the coupling between the two sectors can break the degeneracy, pushing the Higgs potential in one sector into the domain of nonzero Higgs expectation (giving the visible sector), and pushing the Higgs potential in the other sector into the domain of zero Higgs expectation (giving the dark sector). The least massive baryon in the dark sector will then be a candidate self-interacting dark matter particle.

2023-08-16, **Slow diffusion around pulsar $Î³$-ray halos and its impact on cosmic rays propagation**, Xiao-Jun Bi et.al., [2308.08099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08099v1)

 The diffusion coefficients around the pulsar $\gamma$-ray halos are highly suppressed compared with the value in the interstellar medium. It is suggested in the literature that the $\gamma$-ray halos can be explained by a ballistic-diffusive (BD) propagation without slow diffusion. However our calculation shows that the BD propagation can not account for the $\gamma$-ray halo profile well. Furthermore the transfer efficiency of the pulsar spin down energy to the high energy electrons and positrons is even larger than 1 in the BD scenario. Therefore slow diffusion is necessary to account for the pulsar $\gamma$-ray halos. Taking the slow diffusion into account the contribution of positron flux originated from nearby pulsars to the AMS-02 data is reexamined. We may also expect a slow diffusion disk of the Milky Way as many such slow diffusion regions exist. The positron contribution to the AMS-02 data from dark matter annihilation in the new propagation model is also reexamined. We find that the dark matter scenario satisfies all the $\gamma$-ray limits in the new propagation model.

2023-08-16, **Fallback onto Kicked Neutron Stars and its Effect on Spin-Kick Alignment**, B. MÃ¼ller et.al., [2308.08312v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08312v1)

 Fallback in core-collapse supernova explosions is potentially of significant importance for the birth spins of neutron stars and black holes. It has recently been pointed out that the angular momentum imparted onto a compact remnant by fallback material is subtly intertwined with its kick because fallback onto a moving neutron star or black hole will preferentially come for a conical region around its direction of travel. We show that contrary to earlier expectations such one-sided fallback accretion onto a neutron star will tend to produce spin-kick misalignment. Since the baroclinic driving term in the vorticity equation is perpendicular to the nearly radial pressure gradient, convective eddies in the progenitor as well as Rayleigh-Taylor plumes growing during the explosion primarily carry angular momentum perpendicular to the radial direction. Fallback material from the accretion volume of a moving neutron star therefore carries substantial angular momentum perpendicular to the kick velocity. We estimate the seed angular momentum fluctuations from convective motions in core-collapse supernova progenitors and argue that accreted fallback material will almost invariably be accreted with the maximum permissible specific angular momentum for reaching the Alfv\'en radius. This imposes a limit of $\mathord{\sim}10^{-2}M\_\odot$ of fallback accretion for fast-spinning young neutron stars with periods of $\mathord{\sim}20\,\mathrm{ms}$ and less for longer birth spin periods.

2023-08-16, **White Dwarf Mass Growth in Cataclysmic Variables: Roles of Dwarf Novae**, Wei-Min Liu et.al., [2308.08298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08298v1)

 The disc instability mechanism (DIM) is widely accepted to account for the transient behaviour of dwarf novae (DNe), which experience short outbursts separated by long quiescence. The duty cycle (the ratio between the outburst duration and the recurrence time) determines the amount of accreted mass by the white dwarf (WDs) during outbursts, thus playing an important role in the long-term binary evolution. Employing the code of Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we systemically investigate the influence of the duty cycles on the evolution of DNe and the mass growth of accreting carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs. Our calculations show that, while the DIM can considerably influence the accretion process, efficient WD-mass growth requires a particular range of the duty cycle. For WDs with the initial masses of 0.6, 0.7 and 1.1 $M\_\odot$, these duty cycles are 0.006$\,\leq$$d$$\,\leq$0.007, $d$\,=\,0.005 and $d$\,=\,0.003, and the accumulated mass of the WDs can reach 0.1, 0.13 and 0.21 $M\_\odot$, respectively. In all of our simulations, no CO WDs can grow their masses to the explosion mass of Type Ia supernovae of about $1.38~M\_\odot$. Because of a much short timescale of the outburst state, the final donor-star masses and orbital periods are insensitive to the duty cycles. Therefore, we propose that the DIM in DNe could alleviate the WD mass problem to some extent.
