2023-08-31, **Meld: Exploring the Feasibility of a Framework-less Framework**, Kyle J. Knoepfel et.al., [2308.16710v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16710v1)

 HEP data-processing frameworks are essential ingredients in getting from raw data to physics results. But they are often tricky to use well, and they present a significant learning barrier for the beginning HEP physicist. In addition, existing frameworks typically support rigid, collider-based data models, which do not map well to neutrino-physics experiments like DUNE. Neutrino physicists thus expend significant effort working around framework limitations instead of using a framework that directly supports their needs.   Presented here is Meld, a Fermilab R&D project, which intends to address these limitations. By leveraging modern C++ capabilities, state-of-the-art concurrency libraries, and a flexible data model, it is possible for beginning (and seasoned) HEP physicists to execute framework programs easily and efficiently, with minimal coupling to framework-specific constructs. Meld aims to directly support the frameworks needs of neutrino experiments like DUNE as well as the more common collider-based experiments.

2023-08-31, **H.E.S.S. realtime follow-ups of IceCube high-energy neutrino alerts**, Federica Bradascio et.al., [2308.16699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16699v1)

 The evidence for multi-messenger photon and neutrino emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056 has demonstrated the importance of realtime follow-up of neutrino events by various ground- and space-based facilities. The effort of H.E.S.S. and other experiments in coordinating observations to obtain quasi-simultaneous multiwavelength flux and spectrum measurements has been critical in measuring the chance coincidence with the high-energy neutrino event IC-170922A and constraining theoretical models. For about a decade, the H.E.S.S. transient program has included a search for gamma-ray emission associated with high-energy neutrino alerts, looking for gamma-ray activity from known sources and newly detected emitters consistent with the neutrino location. In this contribution, we present an overview of follow-up activities for realtime neutrino alerts with H.E.S.S. in 2021 and 2022. Our analysis includes both public IceCube neutrino alerts and alerts exchanged as part of a joint H.E.S.S.-IceCube program. We focus on interesting coincidences observed with gamma-ray sources, particularly highlighting the significant detection of PKS 0625-35, an AGN previously detected by H.E.S.S., and three IceCube neutrinos.

2023-08-31, **Probing the dipole portal to heavy neutral leptons via meson decays at the high-luminosity LHC**, Daniele Barducci et.al., [2308.16608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16608v1)

 We consider the dipole portal to sterile neutrinos, also called heavy neutral leptons (HNLs). The dipole interaction with the photon leads to HNL production in meson decays, as well as triggers the HNL decay into an active neutrino and a photon. HNLs with masses of order of 0.01-1 GeV are naturally long-lived if the dipole coupling is sufficiently small. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations and derive the sensitivities of the proposed FASER2 and FACET long-lived particle experiments to HNLs produced via the dipole operator in meson decays at the high-luminosity LHC. Our findings show that these future detectors will be complementary to each other, as well as to existing experiments, and will be able to probe new parts of the parameter space, especially in the case of the dipole operator coupled to the tau neutrino.

2023-08-31, **Measurements of the $ν_μ$ and $\barν_μ$-induced Coherent Charged Pion Production Cross Sections on $^{12}C$ by the T2K experiment**, K. Abe et.al., [2308.16606v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16606v1)

 We report an updated measurement of the $\nu\_{\mu}$-induced, and the first measurement of the $\bar{\nu}\_{\mu}$-induced coherent charged pion production cross section on $^{12}C$ nuclei in the T2K experiment. This is measured in a restricted region of the final-state phase space for which $p\_{\mu,\pi} > 0.2$ GeV, $\cos(\theta\_{\mu}) > 0.8$ and $\cos(\theta\_{\pi}) > 0.6$, and at a mean (anti)neutrino energy of 0.85 GeV using the T2K near detector. The measured $\nu\_{\mu}$ CC coherent pion production flux-averaged cross section on $^{12}C$ is $(2.98 \pm 0.37 (stat.) \pm 0.31 (syst.) \substack{ +0.49 \\ -0.00 } \mathrm{ (Q^2\,model)}) \times 10^{-40}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. The new measurement of the $\bar{\nu}\_{\mu}$-induced cross section on $^{12}{C}$ is $(3.05 \pm 0.71 (stat.) \pm 0.39 (syst.) \substack{ +0.74 \\ -0.00 } \mathrm{(Q^2\,model)}) \times 10^{-40}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. The results are compatible with both the NEUT 5.4.0 Berger-Sehgal (2009) and GENIE 2.8.0 Rein-Sehgal (2007) model predictions.

2023-08-31, **Fast neutron star cooling in light of the PREX-2 experiment**, Trisha Sarkar et.al., [2308.16449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16449v1)

 The nuclear symmetry energy and its behaviour with density has been recently evaluated with enhanced value by PREX-2 experiment. This new values enables direct Urca neutrino emission process to be functioning in the dense matter inside neutron stars. With this new outlook we study the cooling rate of canonical mass neutron stars and compare with available observational cooling data. We find most of the isolated neutron star thermal profile is compatible with the cooling of canonical mass star including superfluidity suppression.

2023-08-31, **Search for the gamma-ray spectral lines with the DAMPE and the Fermi-LAT observations**, Ji-Gui Cheng et.al., [2308.16762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16762v1)

 Weakly interacting massive particles, as a major candidate of dark matter (DM), may directly annihilate or decay into high-energy photons, producing monochromatic spectral lines in the gamma-ray band. These spectral lines, if detected, are smoking-gun signatures for the existence of new physics. Using the 5 years of DAMPE and 13 years of Fermi-LAT data, we search for line-like signals in the energy range of 3 GeV to 1 TeV from the Galactic halo. Different regions of interest are considered to accommodate different DM density profiles. We do not find any significant line structure, and the previously reported line-like feature at $\sim$133 GeV is also not detected in our analysis. Adopting a local DM density of $\rho\_{\rm local}=0.4\,{\rm GeV\,cm^{-3}}$, we derive 95% confidence level constraints on the velocity-averaged cross-section of $\langle{\sigma v}\rangle\_{\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and the decay lifetime of $\tau\_{\gamma\nu} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{29}\,{\rm s}$ at 100 GeV, achieving the strongest constraints to date for the line energies of 6-660 GeV. The improvement stems from the longer Fermi-LAT data set used and the inclusion of DAMPE data in the analysis. The simultaneous use of two independent data sets could also reduce the systematic uncertainty of the search.

2023-08-31, **21cm signal sensitivity to dark matter decay**, Gaétan Facchinetti et.al., [2308.16656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16656v1)

 The redshifted 21cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn is expected to provide unprecedented insights into early Universe astrophysics and cosmology. Here we explore how dark matter can heat the intergalactic medium before the first galaxies, leaving a distinctive imprint in the 21cm power spectrum. We provide the first dedicated Fisher matrix forecasts on the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope to dark matter decays. We show that with 1000 hours of observation, HERA has the potential to improve current cosmological constraints on the dark matter decay lifetime by up to three orders of magnitude. Even in extreme scenarios with strong X-ray emission from early-forming, metal-free galaxies, the bounds on the decay lifetime would be improved by up to two orders of magnitude. Overall, HERA shall improve on existing limits for dark matter masses below $2$ GeV$/c^2$ for decays into $e^+e^-$ and below few MeV$/c^2$ for decays into photons.

2023-08-31, **Gravitational Lensing in Modified Gravity: A case study for Fast Radio Bursts**, Surajit Kalita et.al., [2308.16604v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16604v1)

 Over the last few decades, a plethora of modifications to general relativity have been proposed to solve a host of cosmological and astrophysical problems. Many modified gravity models are now ruled out with further astrophysical observations; some theories are still viable, with, at best, bounds on their parameters set by observations to date. More recently, observations of Fast Radio Bursts have proven to be remarkably powerful tools to constrain cosmology and fundamental physics. In this work, we consider a generic modified gravity theory and consider the implications for gravitational lensing with Fast Radio Bursts. We use a set of Fast Radio Burst observations to constrain the fraction of dark matter made up of primordial black holes in such a theory. We further show that modified gravity adds a screening effect on gravitational lensing similar to the case when there is plasma in the path of the light ray acting as a scattering screen.

2023-08-31, **Instantaneous Symmetry Breaking to the Non-observed Dark Matter**, Yaquan Fang et.al., [2308.16412v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16412v1)

 A theory explaining the non-observation of the dark matter and the source of the dark energy is presented in this letter. By integrating the asymmetrical potential and the Higgs potential, we provide a model with instantaneous symmetrical breaking and stable symmetrical breaking, resulting in the non-observed dark matter and observed matter respectively. Two crucial parameters in this model are the frequency and strength of the symmetry breaking from the vacuum: the former helps explain the impact of the effective mass from the dark matter; the latter determines the source of the dark energy. The expected strength in a certain period varies, causing the accelerating or deccelerating expansions of the universe. Considering the expected strength correlated with the vacuum expectation value and basing on the possible variations of the measured masses of the fundamental particles such as Z boson over time, one can perhaps derive the exact stage of the current universe.

2023-08-31, **Dark phase transition from WIMP: complementary tests from gravitational waves and colliders**, Shinya Kanemura et.al., [2308.16390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16390v1)

 A dark sector is an interesting place where a strong first-order phase transition, observable gravitational waves and/or a dark matter candidate could arise. However, the experimental tests for such a dark sector could be ambiguous due to the dark content, largely unconstrained parameter space and the connection to the visible world. We consider a minimal dark scalar-vector boson plasma to realize the three mentioned phenomena, with a unique connection to the Standard Model via the Higgs portal coupling. We discuss the important features of the Higgs portal in such a minimal dark sector, namely the dark thermalization, collider tests, and direct detection of dark matter. We perform numerical analyses of the dark phase transition associated with stochastic gravitational waves and dark matter, discussing the complementarity of collider detection, dark matter direct detection and space-based/terrestrial interferometers as a promising avenue to hear and see the minimal dark sector.

2023-08-31, **Unravelling multi-temperature dust populations in the dwarf galaxy Holmberg II**, Olag Pratim Bordoloi et.al., [2308.16883v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16883v1)

 Holmberg II - a dwarf galaxy in the nearby M81 group - is a very informative source of distribution of gas and dust in the interstellar discs. High-resolution observations in the infrared (IR) allows us to distinguish isolated star-forming regions, photodissociation (PDR) and HII regions, remnants of supernovae (SNe) explosions and, as such, can provide information about more relevant physical processes. In this paper we analyse dust emission in the wavelength range 4.5 to 160 micron using the data from IR space observatories at 27 different locations across the galaxy. We observe that the derived spectra can be represented by multiple dust populations with different temperatures, which are found to be independent of their locations in the galaxy. By comparing the dust temperatures with the far ultraviolet (FUV) intensities observed by the UVIT instrument onboard AstroSat, we find that for locations showing a 100 micron peak, the temperature of cold (20 to 30 K) dust grains show a dependence on the FUV intensities, while such dependence is not observed for the other locations. We believe that the approach described here can be a good tool in revealing different dust populations in other nearby galaxies with available high spatial resolution data.

2023-08-31, **The MPIfR-MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey II. The eccentric double neutron star system PSR J1208-5936 and a neutron star merger rate update**, M. Colom i Bernadich et.al., [2308.16802v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16802v1)

 The MMGPS-L is the most sensitive pulsar survey in the Southern Hemisphere. We present a follow-up study of one of these new discoveries, PSR J1208-5936, a 28.71-ms recycled pulsar in a double neutron star system with an orbital period of Pb=0.632 days and an eccentricity of e=0.348. Through timing of almost one year of observations, we detected the relativistic advance of periastron (0.918(1) deg/yr), resulting in a total system mass of Mt=2.586(5) Mo. We also achieved low-significance constraints on the amplitude of the Einstein delay and Shapiro delay, in turn yielding constraints on the pulsar mass (Mp=1.26(+0.13/-0.25) Mo), the companion mass (Mc=1.32(+0.25/-0.13) Mo, and the inclination angle (i=57(2) degrees). This system is highly eccentric compared to other Galactic field double neutron stars with similar periods, possibly hinting at a larger-than-usual supernova kick during the formation of the second-born neutron star. The binary will merge within 7.2(2) Gyr due to the emission of gravitational waves. With the improved sensitivity of the MMGPS-L, we updated the Milky Way neutron star merger rate to be 25(+19/-9) Myr$^{-1}$ within 90% credible intervals, which is lower than previous studies based on known Galactic binaries owing to the lack of further detections despite the highly sensitive nature of the survey. This implies a local cosmic neutron star merger rate of 293(+222/-103} Gpc/yr, consistent with LIGO and Virgo O3 observations. With this, we predict the observation of 10(+8/-4) neutron star merger events during the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4 run. We predict the uncertainties on the component masses and the inclination angle will be reduced to 5x10$^{-3}$ Mo and 0.4 degrees after two decades of timing, and that in at least a decade from now the detection of the shift in Pb and the sky proper motion will serve to make an independent constraint of the distance to the system.

2023-08-31, **Exploring the Polarization of Axially Symmetric Supernovae with Unsupervised Deep Learning**, J. R. Maund et.al., [2308.16686v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16686v1)

 The measurement of non-zero polarization can be used to infer the presence of departures from spherical symmetry in supernovae (SNe). The origin of the majority of the intrinsic polarization observed in SNe is in electron scattering, which induces a wavelength-independent continuum polarization that is generally observed to be low (<1%) for all SN types. The key indicator of asymmetry in SNe is the polarization observed across spectral lines, in particular the characteristic ``inverse P Cygni'' profile. The results of a suite of 900 Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations are presented here. These simulations cover a range of possible axisymmetric structures (including unipolar, bipolar and equatorial enhancements) for the line forming region of the Ca II infrared triplet. Using a Variational Autoencoder, 7 key latent parameters are learned that describe the relationship between Stokes I and Stokes q, under the assumption of an axially symmetric line forming region and resonant scattering. Likelihood-free inference techniques are used to invert the Stokes I and q line profiles, in the latent space, to derive the underlying geometries. For axially symmetric structures, that yield an observable ``dominant axis'' on the Stokes $q-u$ plane, we propose the existence of a geometry ``conjugate" (which is indistinguishable under a rotation of $\pi /2$). Using this machine learning infrastructure, we attempt to identify possible geometries associated with spectropolarimetric observations of the Type Ib SN 2017gax.

2023-08-31, **The Orion-Taurus ridge: a synchrotron radio loop at the edge of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble**, Andrea Bracco et.al., [2308.16663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16663v1)

 Large-scale synchrotron loops are recognized as the main source of diffuse radio-continuum emission in the Galaxy at intermediate and high Galactic latitudes. Their origin, however, remains rather unexplained. Using a combination of multi-frequency data in the radio band of total and polarized intensities, for the first time in this letter, we associate one arc -- hereafter, the Orion-Taurus ridge -- with the wall of the most prominent stellar-feedback blown shell in the Solar neighborhood, namely the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. We traced the Orion-Taurus ridge using 3D maps of interstellar dust extinction and column-density maps of molecular gas, $N\_{\rm H\_2}$. We found the Orion-Taurus ridge at a distance of 400\,pc, with a plane-of-the-sky extent of $180$\,pc. Its median $N\_{\rm H\_2}$ value is $(1.4^{+2.6}\_{-0.6})\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. Thanks to the broadband observations below 100 MHz of the Long Wavelength Array, we also computed the low-frequency spectral-index map of synchrotron emissivity, $\beta$, in the Orion-Taurus ridge. We found a flat distribution of $\beta$ with a median value of $-2.24^{+0.03}\_{-0.02}$ that we interpreted in terms of depletion of low-energy ($<$ GeV) cosmic-ray electrons in recent supernova remnants ($10^5$ - $10^6$ yrs). Our results are consistent with plane-of-the-sky magnetic-field strengths in the Orion-Taurus ridge larger than a few tens of $\mu$G ($> 30 - 40 \,\mu$G). We report the first detection of diffuse synchrotron emission from cold-neutral, partly molecular, gas in the surroundings of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. This observation opens a new perspective to study the multiphase and magnetized interstellar medium with the advent of future high-sensitivity radio facilities, such as the C-Band All-Sky Survey and the Square Kilometre Array.
