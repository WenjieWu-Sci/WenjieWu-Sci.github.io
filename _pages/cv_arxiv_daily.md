2023-10-24, **Searching for sub-populations within the gamma-ray solar flares catalog: a graph-based clustering analysis**, Jonathan Mauro et.al., [2310.16011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16011v1)

 Solar flares are highly energetic events that happen in the solar atmosphere. They are mostly observed as X-ray or gamma-ray bursts located on the Sun's surface. While they are known to be sites of particle acceleration, the acceleration process(es) responsible for the observed fluxes remain unsure. The diversity in shape and duration of the gamma-ray fluxes suggests the existence of distinct phases of hadronic acceleration. Moreover, different acceleration processes could explain the differences observed among flares. In this work we search for the evidence of sub-populations within the catalog of gamma-ray solar flares observed by Fermi-LAT. We aim at grouping flares with similar physical properties to be able to probe theoretical models for neutrino production within different classes of flares. We use measurements of the X-ray and gamma-ray fluxes, as well as CMEs and SEPs, to cluster the events using a graph-based algorithm. Furthermore, we investigate the most representative features that characterise the identified sub-populations to allow for qualitative analysis and model development.

2023-10-24, **Gravitational production of sterile neutrinos**, Fotis Koutroulis et.al., [2310.15906v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15906v1)

 We consider gravitational production of singlet fermions such as sterile neutrinos during and after inflation. The production efficiency due to classical gravity is suppressed by the fermion mass. Quantum gravitational effects, on the other hand, are expected to break conformal invariance of the fermion sector by the Planck scale-suppressed operators irrespective of the mass. We find that such operators are very efficient in fermion production immediately after inflation, generating a significant background of stable or long-lived feebly interacting particles. This applies, in particular, to sterile neutrinos which can constitute cold non-thermal dark matter for a wide range of masses, including the keV scale.

2023-10-24, **High-energy Neutrino Emission Associated with GWs from Binary Black Hole Mergers in AGN Accretion Discs**, Zi-Hang Zhou et.al., [2310.15832v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15832v1)

 The search for multi-messenger signals of binary black hole (BBH) mergers is crucial to understanding the merger process of BBH and the relative astrophysical environment. Considering BBH mergers occurring in the active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks, we focus on the accompanying high-energy neutrino production from the interaction between the jet launched by the post-merger remnant BH and disk materials. Particles can be accelerated by the shocks generated from the jet-disk interaction and subsequently interact with the disk gas and radiations to produce high-energy neutrinos through hadronic processes. We demonstrate that the identification of the high-energy neutrino signal from BBH merger in AGN disks is feasible. In addition, the joint BBH gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino detection rate is derived, which can be used to constrain the BBH merger rate and the accretion rate of the remnant BH based on the future associated detections of GWs and neutrinos.

2023-10-24, **Results from SND@LHC**, Ettore Zaffaroni et.al., [2310.15791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15791v1)

 SND@LHC is a compact and stand-alone experiment to perform measurements with neutrinos produced at the LHC in a hitherto unexplored pseudo-rapidity region of $7.2 < \eta < 8.4$, complementary to all the other experiments at the LHC. The experiment is located 480 m downstream of IP1 in the unused TI18 tunnel. The detector is composed of a hybrid system based on an 800 kg target mass of tungsten plates, interleaved with emulsion and electronic trackers, followed downstream by a calorimeter and a muon system. The configuration allows efficiently distinguishing between all three neutrino flavours, opening a unique opportunity to probe physics of heavy flavour production at the LHC in the region that is not accessible to ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. SND@LHC has started taking data in 2022 and in this work the direct observation of muon neutrino interaction in the detector is reported.

2023-10-24, **IceCube -- Neutrinos in Deep Ice The Top 3 Solutions from the Public Kaggle Competition**, Habib Bukhari et.al., [2310.15674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15674v1)

 During the public Kaggle competition "IceCube -- Neutrinos in Deep Ice", thousands of reconstruction algorithms were created and submitted, aiming to estimate the direction of neutrino events recorded by the IceCube detector. Here we describe in detail the three ultimate best, award-winning solutions. The data handling, architecture, and training process of each of these machine learning models is laid out, followed up by an in-depth comparison of the performance on the kaggle datatset. We show that on cascade events in IceCube above 10 TeV, the best kaggle solution is able to achieve an angular resolution of better than 5 degrees, and for tracks correspondingly better than 0.5 degrees. These performance measures compare favourably to the current state-of-the-art in the field.

2023-10-24, **Longitudinal kinematic imbalances in (anti-)neutrino interactions for improved measurements of nuclear removal energies and the axial vector form factor**, Nathan Baudis et.al., [2310.15633v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15633v1)

 Current and future accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments require an improved understanding of nuclear effects in neutrino-nucleus interactions. One important systematic uncertainty is given by potential mismodeling of the removal energy, which biases the reconstruction of the neutrino energy. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel observable for accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments, the visible longitudinal momentum imbalance, reconstructed in charged current quasi-elastic interactions from the outgoing charged lepton and nucleon. Minimally dependent on the neutrino energy and directly sensitive to the removal energy distribution, we demonstrate a method to constrain the latter. Further, we show how the use of the longitudinal imbalance in anti-neutrino interactions in a target containing hydrogen allows for an improved, high-purity selection of the interactions on hydrogen. This approach offers the potential for precise measurements of the nuclear axial vector form factor as well as of the anti-neutrino flux.

2023-10-23, **A Global Fit of Non-Relativistic Effective Dark Matter Operators Including Solar Neutrinos**, Neal P. Avis Kozar et.al., [2310.15392v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15392v1)

 We perform a global fit of dark matter interactions with nucleons using a non-relativistic effective operator description, considering both direct detection and neutrino data. We examine the impact of combining the direct detection experiments CDMSlite, CRESST-II, CRESST-III, DarkSide-50, LUX, LZ, PandaX-II, PandaX-4T, PICO-60, SIMPLE, SuperCDMS, XENON100, and XENON1T along with neutrino data from IceCube and ANTARES. While current neutrino telescope data lead to increased sensitivity compared to underground nuclear scattering experiments for dark matter masses above 100 GeV, our future projections show that the next generation of underground experiments will significantly outpace solar searches for most dark matter-nucleon elastic scattering interactions.

2023-10-23, **General Approach to Neutrino Mass Mechanisms with Sterile Neutrinos**, Yale Fan et.al., [2310.15379v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15379v1)

 We present a mathematical framework for constructing the most general neutrino mass matrices that yield the observed spectrum of light active neutrino masses in conjunction with arbitrarily many heavy sterile neutrinos, without the need to assume a hierarchy between Dirac and Majorana mass terms. The seesaw mechanism is a byproduct of the formalism, along with many other possibilities for generating tiny neutrino masses. We comment on phenomenological applications of this approach, in particular deriving a mechanism to address the long-standing $(g-2)\_\mu$ anomaly in the context of the left-right symmetric model.

2023-10-23, **Diffuse supernova neutrino background with up-to-date star formation rate measurements and long-term multi-dimensional supernova simulations**, Nick Ekanger et.al., [2310.15254v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15254v1)

 The sensitivity of current and future neutrino detectors like Super-Kamiokande (SK), JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande (HK), and DUNE is expected to allow for the detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB). However, the DSNB model ingredients like the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) rate, neutrino emission spectra, and the fraction of failed supernovae are not precisely known. We quantify the uncertainty on each of these ingredients by (i) compiling a large database of recent star formation rate density measurements, (ii) combining neutrino emission from long-term axisymmetric CCSNe simulations and strategies for estimating the emission from the protoneutron star cooling phase, and (iii) assuming different models of failed supernovae. Finally, we calculate the fluxes and event rates at multiple experiments and perform a simplified statistical estimate of the time required to significantly detect the DSNB at SK with the gadolinium upgrade and JUNO. Our fiducial model predicts a flux of $5.1\pm0.4^{+0.0+0.5}\_{-2.0-2.7}\,{\rm cm^2~s^{-1}}$ at SK employing Gd-tagging, or $3.6\pm0.3^{+0.0+0.8}\_{-1.6-1.9}$ events per year, where the errors represent our uncertainty from star formation rate density measurements, uncertainty in neutrino emission, and uncertainty in the failed-supernova scenario. In this fiducial calculation, we could see a $3\sigma$ detection by $\sim2030$ with SK-Gd and a $5\sigma$ detection by $\sim2035$ with a joint SK-Gd/JUNO analysis, but background reduction remains crucial.

2023-10-23, **Flavor Anisotropy in the High-Energy Astrophysical Neutrino Sky**, Bernanda Telalovic et.al., [2310.15224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15224v1)

 High-energy astrophysical neutrinos, with TeV--PeV energies, offer unique insight into astrophysics and particle physics. Their incoming directions and flavor composition -- i.e., the proportion of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos in their flux -- are, individually, rewarding observables. Combined, they offer new opportunities, hitherto unexplored, that we expose for the first time. Anisotropy in the arrival directions of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos may reveal multiple populations of neutrino sources, differently distributed in the sky, and test whether neutrinos of different flavor propagate preferentially along certain directions, such as expected from breaking Lorentz invariance. Using 7.5 years of public IceCube High-Energy Starting Events, we make the first measurement of the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, constrain the presence of flavor dipoles and quadrupoles, and improve constraints on "compass asymmetries" introduced by Lorentz invariance violation. In the near future, upcoming neutrino telescopes will improve these measurements across the board.

2023-10-23, **The Interplay between accelerated Protons, X-rays and Neutrinos in the Corona of NGC 1068: Constraints from Kinetic Plasma Simulations**, Rostom Mbarek et.al., [2310.15222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15222v1)

 We examine properties of accelerated protons potentially responsible for the neutrino excess observed in the direction of NGC 1068, using constraints from kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. We find that i) coronal X-rays and Optical/Ultra-Violet light in the inner disk lead to efficient absorption of hadronic $\gamma$-rays within 100 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole; ii) protons accelerated from the coronal thermal pool cannot account for the observed neutrinos; and iii) explaining the observed signal requires an injection of protons with a hard spectrum, peaking at $\gamma\_p\sim 10^4$, into the turbulent magnetically-dominated corona, where they are confined and re-accelerated. The resulting neutrino signal can be consistent with IceCube observations. In our most favorable scenario, the injected protons are pre-accelerated in intermittent current sheets in the vicinity of the black hole, occurring either at the boundary between the disk and the outflow or during magnetic flux eruption events.

2023-10-23, **$B \to K ν\barν$, MiniBooNE and muon $g-2$ anomalies from a dark sector**, Alakabha Datta et.al., [2310.15136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15136v1)

 Belle II has reported the first evidence for $B^+ \to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ with a branching ratio $2.8 \sigma$ higher than the standard model expectation. We explain this, and the MiniBooNE and muon anomalous magnetic moment anomalies in a model with a dark scalar that couples to a slightly heavier sterile Dirac neutrino and that communicates with the visible sector via a Higgs portal. We make predictions for rare kaon and other $B$ meson decays.

2023-10-23, **A 1-D Special Relativistic Shock Tube where Stellar Fluid undergoes Neutrino Heating**, Gregory Mohammed et.al., [2310.14494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14494v1)

 To investigate the physical nature of neutrino-heating on the result of a 1-dimensional core-collapse supernova. Colgate were the first to suggest that neutrinos may play a crucial role in core collapse supernova by taking up gravitational binding energy from the core and depositing it in the rest of the star. The fluid is contained in a shock tube in a region extending from the neutrino-sphere of a star out 1000 km, and irradiated with a neutrino flux emanating from the surface of the neutrino-sphere into the shock tube. Interaction due to electron-neutrino scattering off of fluid nucleons is used to account for neutrino heating of the fluid. The numerical method used is the Godunov method implementing an exact Riemann solver Rezzolla when needed. The simulated core-collapse produces an energy output of up to $10^{36}$J on a timescale of 3.33 s. It was found that the Godunov method performs very well using Sod data, with standard deviations of between $0.22-0.04$%. Thus, there is high confidence that the exact Riemann solver is working correctly and that the Godunov method is also reproducing the exact solutions to the Sod data with high confidence. A runtime of 3.33 s was used. The objective was to determine what would happen to the shock system over longer timescales, but the simulations showed an explosion in a much shorter time frame. It was found that the shock not only continues to move outward, but is also driven by large energy and pressure behind the shock. The density profiles show that fluid mass is pushed outward, but the fluid velocity actually reversed on timescales close to 3.33 s. In this paper, net mass movement occurs at 500-600 km and on a longer timescale of 3.33 s mass has moved out to 700 km. This supports the \emph{delayed post bounce shock mechanism}.

2023-10-24, **Experimental measurement of the quality factor of a Fabry-Pérot open-cavity axion haloscope**, Juan F. Hernández-Cabrera et.al., [2310.16013v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16013v1)

 The axion is a hypothetical boson arising from the most natural solution to the problem of charge and parity symmetry in the strong nuclear force. Moreover, this pseudoscalar emerges as a dark matter candidate in a parameter space extending several decades in mass. The Dark-photons \& Axion-Like particles Interferometer (DALI) is a proposal to search for axion dark matter in a range that remains under-examined. Currently in a design and prototyping phase, this haloscope is a multilayer Fabry-P\'erot interferometer. A proof-of-principle experiment is performed to observe the resonance in a prototype. The test unveils a quality factor per open cavity of a few hundred over a bandwidth of the order of dozens of megahertz. The result elucidates a physics potential to find the, so far elusive, axion, in a sector which can simultaneously solve the symmetry problem in the strong interaction and the enigma of dark matter.

2023-10-24, **Prospects for probing the interaction between dark energy and dark matter using gravitational-wave dark sirens with neutron star tidal deformation**, Tian-Nuo Li et.al., [2310.15879v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15879v1)

 Gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations provide a rather useful tool to explore the evolution of the universe. In this work, we wish to investigate whether the dark sirens with neutron star (NS) deformation from third-generation (3G) GW detectors could help probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We simulate the GW dark sirens of four detection strategies based on the three-year observation and consider four phenomenological interacting dark energy models to perform cosmological analysis. We find that GW dark sirens could provide tight constraints on $\Omega\_{\rm m}$ and $H\_0$ in the four IDE models, but perform not well in constraining the dimensionless coupling parameter $\beta$ with the interaction proportional to the energy density of cold dark matter. Nevertheless, the parameter degeneracy orientations of CMB and GW are almost orthogonal, and thus the combination of them could effectively break cosmological parameter degeneracies, with the constraint errors of $\beta$ being 0.00068-0.018. In addition, we choose three typical equation of states (EoSs) of NS, i.e., SLy, MPA1, and MS1, to investigate the effect of NS's EoS in cosmological analysis. The stiffer EoS could give tighter constraints than the softer EoS. Nonetheless, the combination of CMB and GW dark sirens (using different EoSs of NS) shows basically the same constraint results of cosmological parameters. We conclude that the dark sirens from 3G GW detectors would play a crucial role in helping probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and the CMB+GW results are basically not affected by the EoS of NS.

2023-10-24, **Temperature profiles of galactic dark matter halos**, Andrés Aceña et.al., [2310.15795v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15795v1)

 We present the temperature profiles of galactic dark matter halos by considering that dark matter can be treated as a classical ideal gas, as an ideal Fermi gas, or as an ideal Bose gas. The only free parameter in the matter model is the mass of the dark matter particle. We obtain the temperature profiles by using the rotational velocity profile proposed by Persic, Salucci, and Stel (1996) and assuming that the dark matter halo is a self-gravitating stand-alone structure. From the temperature profiles, we conclude that the classical ideal gas and the ideal Fermi gas are not viable explanations for dark matter, while the ideal Bose gas is if the mass of the particle is low enough. If we take into account the relationship presented by Donato et al. (2009) and Gentile et al. (2009) between central density and core radius then we conclude that the central temperature of dark matter in all galaxies is the same. Also, the dark matter halo is in a state of Bose-Einstein condensation, or at least the central region is. By using fittings of observational data, we can put an upper bound on the dark matter particle mass in the order of $13\,eV/c^2$.

2023-10-24, **The Tully-Fisher relation and the Bosma effect**, Francesco Sylos Labini et.al., [2310.15673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15673v1)

 We show that the rotation curves of 16 nearby disc galaxies in the THINGS sample and the Milky Way can be described by the NFW halo model and by the Bosma effect at approximately the same level of accuracy. The latter effect suggests that the behavior of the rotation curve at large radii is determined by the rescaled gas component and thus that dark matter and gas distributions are tightly correlated. By focusing on galaxies with exponential decay in their gas surface density, we can normalize their rotation curves to match the exponential thin disc model at large enough radii. This normalization assumes that the galaxy mass is estimated consistently within this model, assuming a thin disc structure. We show that this rescaling allows us to derive a new version of the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation, the Bosma TF relation that nicely fit the data. In the framework of this model, the connection between the Bosma Tully-Fisher (TF) relation and the baryonic TF relation can be established by considering an additional empirical relation between the baryonic mass and the total mass of the disc, as measured in the data.

2023-10-24, **Constraining exotic dark matter models with the dark ages 21-cm signal**, Rajesh Mondal et.al., [2310.15530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15530v1)

 The 21-cm signal from the dark ages is a powerful tool for fundamental cosmology and for probing new physics. While it can be used for precision measurements within standard cosmology, here we study two non-standard models: an excess radio background (ERB) model (possibly generated by dark matter decay) and the millicharged dark matter (mDM) model. These models were inspired by the possible EDGES detection of a strong global 21-cm absorption during cosmic dawn, but more generally they provide a way to anticipate the potential discovery space. We find that during the dark ages the 21-cm global signal in the ERB model reaches a saturated form for an amplitude $A\_{\rm r}=0.4$, where $A\_{\rm r}$ is the radio background intensity at cosmic dawn relative to the cosmic microwave background. This amplitude is one fifth of the minimum required to explain the EDGES signal, and corresponds to just 0.1\% of the observed extragalactic background; it would give a signal that can be detected at 5.9$\sigma$ significance (compared to 4.1$\sigma$ for the standard signal) and distinguished from the standard (no ERB) signal at 8.5$\sigma$, all with a 1,000 hour global signal measurement. A lower $A\_{\rm r}=0.039$ could be distinguished at 5$\sigma$. The 21-cm power spectrum has potentially much more information, but far greater resources would be required for comparable constraints on the ERB signal. For the mDM model, over a range of viable parameters, the global signal detection significance would be $4.7-7.2\,\sigma$, and it could be distinguished from standard at $2.2-9.3\,\sigma$. With an array of global signal antennas achieving an effective 100,000 hr integration, the significance would be 10$\times$ better. Our analysis helps motivate the development of lunar and space-based dark ages experiments.

2023-10-23, **Hunting Dark Matter Lines in the Infrared Background with the James Webb Space Telescope**, Ryan Janish et.al., [2310.15395v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15395v1)

 Dark matter particles with a mass around 1 eV can decay into near-infrared photons. Utilising available public blank sky observations from the NIRSpec IFU on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we search for a narrow emission line due to decaying dark matter and derive leading constraints in the mass range 0.8-3 eV on the decay rate to photons, and more specifically, on the axion-photon coupling for the case of axion-like particles. We exclude $\tau < 6.7\cdot 10^{26}$ s at $m\_{\rm DM} \simeq 0.9$ eV and, in the case of axions, $g\_{a \gamma \gamma} > 9.4 \cdot 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m\_a = 2.15$ eV. Our results do not rely on dedicated observations, rather we use blank sky observations intended for sky subtraction, and thus our reach may be automatically strengthened as JWST continues to observe.

2023-10-23, **Topological constraints on general relativistic galaxies: Exploring novel conical singularity networks**, Marco Galoppo et.al., [2310.15382v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15382v1)

 The van Stockum-Bonner class of spacetimes can be interpreted as fully general relativistic models for rigidly rotating disc galaxies. Frame-dragging effects in these geometries demand a recalibration of the dark matter content relative to models based on Newtonian gravity. We investigate the previously overlooked topological structure of these spacetimes, in relation to the viability of fully general relativistic galaxy toy models. We discuss the appropriate boundary conditions for these solutions to model disc galaxies. For this class of spacetimes, we show the existence of a network of quasi-regular singularities along the rotation axis of the galaxies. The existence of such novel conical defect structures further restricts the physical viability of the van Stockum-Bonner class. Unwinding these issues is key to avoiding pathologies in future fully general relativistic modelling of alternative to dark matter.

2023-10-23, **Rydberg-atom-based single-photon detection for haloscope axion searches**, Eleanor Graham et.al., [2310.15352v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15352v1)

 We propose a Rydberg-atom-based single-photon detector for signal readout in dark matter haloscope experiments between 10 GHz and 50 GHz. At these frequencies, standard haloscope readout using linear amplifiers is limited by quantum measurement noise, which can be avoided by using a single-photon detector. Our single-photon detection scheme can offer scan rate enhancements up to a factor of $10^4$ over traditional linear amplifier readout, and is compatible with many different haloscope cavities. We identify multiple haloscope designs that could use our Rydberg-atom-based single-photon detector to search for QCD axions with masses above 40 ${\mu}$eV (10 GHz), currently a minimally explored parameter space.

2023-10-23, **Can prompt cusps of WIMP dark matter be detected as individual gamma-ray sources?**, M. Sten Delos et.al., [2310.15214v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15214v1)

 Prompt $\rho\propto r^{-1.5}$ density cusps are the densest and most abundant dark matter systems. If the dark matter is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP), recent studies have shown that prompt cusps dominate the aggregate dark matter annihilation rate. This article explores whether individual prompt cusps could be detected as gamma-ray sources. At the Fermi telescope's point-source sensitivity, WIMPs with the canonical annihilation cross section could form detectable prompt cusps if the particle mass is of order 10 GeV. These objects could be 10-100 pc away and weigh under a solar mass; they would subtend around 0.1 degrees on the sky. For GeV-scale dark matter particles with below-canonical cross sections, searches for individual prompt cusps can be more sensitive than searches for the annihilation signals from galactic dark matter halos.

2023-10-23, **Anisotropies in Scalar-Induced Gravitational-Wave Background from Inflaton-Curvaton Mixed Scenario with Sound Speed Resonance**, Yan-Heng Yu et.al., [2310.14606v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14606v1)

 We propose a new model to generate large anisotropies in the scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background via sound speed resonance in the inflaton-curvaton mixed scenario. Cosmological curvature perturbations are not only exponentially amplified at a resonant frequency, but also preserve significant non-Gaussianity of local type described by $f\_{\mathrm{nl}}$. Besides a significant enhancement of energy-density fraction spectrum, large anisotropies in SIGWs can be generated, because of super-horizon modulations of the energy density due to existence of primordial non-Gaussianity. A reduced angular power spectrum $\tilde{C}\_{\ell}$ could reach an amplitude of $[\ell(\ell+1)\tilde{C}\_{\ell}]^{1/2} \sim 10^{-2}$, leading to potential measurements via planned gravitational-wave detectors such as DECIGO. The large anisotropies in SIGWs would serve as a powerful probe of the early universe, shedding new light on the inflationary dynamics, primordial non-Gaussianity, and primordial black hole dark matter.

2023-10-24, **Violent mass ejection by the progenitors of the brightest planetary nebulae: supernova progenitors**, Noam Soker et.al., [2310.15785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15785v1)

 I examine the morphologies of the brightest planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Milky Way Galaxy and conclude that violent binary interaction processes eject the main nebulae of the brightest PNe. The typical morphologies of the brightest PNe are multipolar, namely have been shaped by two or more major jet-launching episodes at varying directions, and possess small to medium departures from pure point-symmetry. The departure from pure point-symmetry is generally not large. This suggests that triple-star interaction is not behind the mass ejection process, but rather a violent binary interaction. By violent interaction I refer to two or more energetic jet-launching episodes within a relatively short time (much shorter than the PN formation time). In particular, I suggest that the timescales of some interactions are shorter than the dynamical timescale of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) progenitor. I discuss some possibilities, including a rapid onset of the common envelope evolution (CEE) and the merger of the companion with the AGB core at the termination of the CEE. I suggest that the most likely companions to experience such interactions are white dwarfs (WDs). Some of these might actually be progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), as I suggest for SNR G1.9+0.3, the youngest SN Ia in the Galaxy. I speculate here on a positive correlation (but not one-to-one correspondence) between the brightest PNe and cases of CEE that end with WD-core merger, including progenitors of some SNe Ia.

2023-10-24, **Supernova Ejecta with Crystalline Silicate Dust in the Supernova Remnant MSH 15-52**, Hyun-Jeong Kim et.al., [2310.15733v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15733v1)

 IRAS 15099-5856 in the young supernova remnant (SNR) MSH 15-52 is the first and only SNR-associated object with crystalline silicate dust detected so far, although its nature and the origin of the crystalline silicate are still unclear. In this paper, we present high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) imaging observations of the bright central compact source IRS1 of IRAS 15099-5856 to study the spatial distributions of gas and dust and the analysis of its Spitzer MIR spectrum to explore the origin of IRS1. The MIR images obtained with the T-ReCS attached on the Gemini South telescope show a complicated, inhomogeneous morphology of IRS1 with bright clumps and diffuse emission in [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m and Qa 18.30 $\mu$m, which confirms that IRS1 is an extended source externally heated by the nearby O star Muzzio 10, a candidate for the binary companion of the progenitor star. The Spitzer MIR spectrum reveals several ionic emission lines including a strong [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m line, but no hydrogen line is detected. We model the spectrum using the photoionization code CLOUDY with varying elemental composition. The elemental abundance of IRS1 derived from the model is close to that of SN ejecta with depleted hydrogen and enhanced metals, particularly neon, argon, and iron. Our results imply that IRS1 originates from the SN ejecta and suggest the possibility of the formation of crystalline silicate in newly-formed SN dust.

2023-10-24, **Probing nuclear physics with supernova gravitational waves and machine learning**, Ayan Mitra et.al., [2310.15649v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15649v1)

 Core-collapse supernovae are sources of powerful gravitational waves (GWs). We assess the possibility of extracting information about the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter from the GW signal. We use the bounce and early post-bounce signals of rapidly rotating supernovae. A large set of GW signals is generated using general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations for various EOS models. The uncertainty in the electron capture rate is parametrized by generating signals for six different models. To classify EOSs based on the GW data, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Even with the uncertainty in the electron capture rates, we find that the CNN models can classify the EOSs with an average accuracy of about 87 percent for a set of four distinct EOS models.

 The origin of Galactic cosmic rays (CR) is still a matter of debate. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) applied to supernova remnant (SNR) shocks provides the most reliable explanation. However, within the current understanding of DSA several issues remain unsolved, like the CR maximum energy, the chemical composition and the transition region between Galactic and extra-Galactic CRs. These issues motivate the search for other possible Galactic sources. Recently, several young stellar clusters (YSC) have been detected in gamma rays, suggesting that such objects could be powerful sources of Galactic CRs. The energy input could come from winds of massive stars hosted in the clusters which is a function of the cluster total mass and initial mass function of stars. In this work we evaluate the total CR flux produced by a synthetic population of YSCs assuming that the CR acceleration occurs at the termination shock of the collective wind resulting from the sum of cluster's stellar winds. We show that the spectrum produced by YSC can significantly contribute to energies $\gtrsim 100$ TeV if the diffusion inside the wind-blown bubble is Bohm-like and the spectral slope is harder than the one produced by SNRs.

 We present detailed implementations of (a) binary stellar evolution (using binary\_c) and (b) dust production and destruction into the cosmological semi-analytic galaxy evolution simulation, L-Galaxies. This new version of L-Galaxies is compared to a version assuming only single stars and to global and spatially-resolved observational data across a range of redshifts ($z$). We find that binaries have a negligible impact on the stellar masses, gas masses, and star formation rates of galaxies only if the total mass ejected by massive stars is unchanged. This is because massive stars determine the strength of supernova (SN) feedback, which in turn regulates galaxy growth. Binary effects, such as common envelope ejection and novae, affect carbon and nitrogen enrichment in galaxies, however heavier alpha elements are more affected by the choice of SN and wind yields. Unlike many other simulations, the new L-Galaxies reproduces observed dust-to-metal (DTM) and dust-to-gas (DTG) ratios at $z\sim{}0-4$. This is mainly due to shorter dust accretion timescales in dust-rich environments. However, dust masses are under-predicted at $z>4$, highlighting the need for enhanced dust production at early times in simulations, possibly accompanied by increased star formation. On sub-galactic scales, there is very good agreement between L-Galaxies and observed dust and metal radial profiles at $z=0$. A drop in DTM ratio is also found in diffuse, low-metallicity regions, contradicting the assumption of a universal value. We hope that this work serves as a useful template for binary stellar evolution implementations in other cosmological simulations in future.

2023-10-23, **Exploring the circumstellar environment of Tycho's supernova remnant--I. The hydrodynamic evolution of the shock**, Ryosuke Kobashi et.al., [2310.14841v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14841v1)

 Among Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs), Tycho's SNR has been considered as a typical object from the viewpoints of its spectroscopic, morphological and environmental properties. A recent reanalysis of Chandra data shows that its forward shock is experiencing a substantial deceleration since around 2007, which suggests recent shock interactions with a dense medium as a consequence of the cavity-wall environment inside a molecular cloud. Such a non-uniform environment can be linked back to the nature and activities of its progenitor. In this study, we perform hydrodynamic simulations to characterize Tycho's cavity-wall environment using the latest multi-epoch proper motion measurements of the forward shock. A range of parameters for the environment is explored in the hydrodynamic models to fit with the observation data for each azimuthal region. Our results show that a wind-like cavity with $\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$ reconciles with the latest data better than a uniform medium with a constant density. In addition, our best-fit model favors an anisotropic wind with an azimuthally varying wind parameter. The overall result indicates a mass-loss rate which is unusually high for the conventional single-degenerate explosion scenario.
