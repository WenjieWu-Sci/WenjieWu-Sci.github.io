2023-05-03, **Linear seesaw mechanism from dark sector**, A. E. Cárcamo Hernández et.al., [2305.02273v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02273v1)

 We propose a minimal model where a dark sector seeds neutrino mass generation radiatively within the linear seesaw mechanism. Neutrino masses are calculable, since tree-level contributions are forbidden by symmetry. They are also protected by lepton number symmetry, their smallness arising from small soft breaking terms. Lepton flavour violating processes e.g. $\mu \to e\gamma$ can be sizeable, despite the tiny neutrino masses. We comment also on dark-matter and collider implications.

2023-05-03, **Treating Detector Systematics via a Likelihood Free Inference Method**, Leander Fischer et.al., [2305.02257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02257v1)

 Estimating the impact of systematic uncertainties in particle physics experiments is challenging, especially since the detector response is unknown analytically in most situations and needs to be estimated through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Typically, detector property variations are parameterized in ways that implicitly assume a specific physics model, which can introduce biases on quantities measured by an analysis. In this paper, we present a method to recover a model-independent, event-wise estimation of the detector response variation by applying a likelihood-free inference method to a set of MC simulations representing discrete detector realizations. The method provides a re-weighting scheme for every event, which can be used to apply the effects of detector property variations fully decoupled from the assumed physics model. Using a toy MC example inspired by fixed-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our method. We show that our method fully decouples the modeling of the detector response from the physics parameters one wishes to measure in a MC forward-folding analysis.

 TRIDENT (The tRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope) is a proposed next-generation neutrino telescope to be constructed in the South China Sea. In September 2021, the TRIDENT Pathfinder experiment (TRIDENT EXplorer, T-REX for short) was conducted to evaluate the in-situ optical properties of seawater. The T-REX experiment deployed three digital optical modules at a depth of 3420 meters, including a light emitter module (LEM) and two light receiver modules (LRMs) equipped with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and cameras to detect light signals. The LEM emits light in pulsing and steady modes. It features a fast tunable driver to activate light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that emit nanosecond-width light pulses with tunable intensity. The PMTs in the LRM receive single photo-electron (SPE) signals with an average photon number of approximately 0.3 per 1-microsecond time window, which is used to measure the arrival time distribution of the SPE signals. The fast tunable driver can be remotely controlled in real-time by the data acquisition system onboard the research vessel, allowing for convenient adjustments to the driver's parameters and facilitating the acquisition of high-quality experimental data. This paper describes the requirements, design scheme, and test results of the fast tunable driver, highlighting its successful implementation in the T-REX experiment and its potential for future deep-sea experiments.

2023-05-03, **Gravitational waves from a scotogenic two-loop neutrino mass model**, Cesar Bonilla et.al., [2305.01964v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01964v1)

 We propose a framework to account for neutrino masses at the two-loop level. This mechanism introduces new scalars and Majorana fermions to the Standard Model. It is assumed the existence of a global $\mathrm{U(1)\times \mathcal{Z}\_2}$ symmetry which after partial breaking provides the stability of the dark matter candidates of the theory. The rich structure of the potential allows for the possibility of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early Universe which can lead to the generation of primordial gravitational waves as one of the potentially observable signatures of this model. Taking into account relevant constraints from lepton flavour violation, neutrino physics as well as the trilinear Higgs couplings at next-to-leading order accuracy, we have found a wide range of possible FOPTs which are strong enough to be probed at the proposed gravitational-wave interferometer experiments such as LISA.

2023-05-03, **Constraints on dark matter-neutrino scattering from the Milky-Way satellites and subhalo modeling for dark acoustic oscillations**, Kensuke Akita et.al., [2305.01913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01913v1)

 The elastic scattering between dark matter (DM) and radiation can potentially explain small-scale observations that the cold dark matter faces as a challenge, as damping density fluctuations via dark acoustic oscillations in the early universe erases small-scale structure. We study a semi-analytical subhalo model for interacting dark matter with radiation, based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and subhalos' tidal evolution prescription. We also test the elastic scattering between DM and neutrinos using observations of Milky-Way satellites from the Dark Energy Survey and PanSTARRS1. We conservatively impose strong constraints on the DM-neutrino scattering cross section of $\sigma\_{{\rm DM}\text{-}\nu,n}\propto E\_\nu^n$ $(n=0,2,4)$ at $95\%$ confidence level (CL), $\sigma\_{{\rm DM}\text{-}\nu,0}< 10^{-32}\ {\rm cm^2}\ (m\_{\rm DM}/{\rm GeV})$, $\sigma\_{{\rm DM}\text{-}\nu,2}< 10^{-43}\ {\rm cm^2}\ (m\_{\rm DM}/{\rm GeV})(E\_\nu/E\_{\nu}^0)^2$ and $\sigma\_{{\rm DM}\text{-}\nu,4}< 10^{-54}\ {\rm cm^2}\ (m\_{\rm DM}/{\rm GeV})(E\_\nu/E\_{\nu}^0)^4$, where $E\_\nu^0$ is the average momentum of relic cosmic neutrinos today, $E\_\nu^0 \simeq 3.15 T\_\nu^0 \simeq 6.1\ {\rm K}$. By imposing a satellite forming condition, we obtain the strongest upper bounds on the DM-neutrino cross section at $95\%$ CL, $\sigma\_{{\rm DM}\text{-}\nu,0}< 4\times 10^{-34}\ {\rm cm^2}\ (m\_{\rm DM}/{\rm GeV})$, $\sigma\_{{\rm DM}\text{-}\nu,2}< 10^{-46}\ {\rm cm^2}\ (m\_{\rm DM}/{\rm GeV})(E\_\nu/E\_{\nu}^0)^2$ and $\sigma\_{{\rm DM}\text{-}\nu,4}< 7\times 10^{-59}\ {\rm cm^2}\ (m\_{\rm DM}/{\rm GeV})(E\_\nu/E\_{\nu}^0)^4$.

2023-05-02, **Neutron decay into a Dark Sector via Leptoquarks**, Sara Khatibi et.al., [2305.01727v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01727v1)

 In this paper, we extend the Standard Model (SM) scalar sector with scalar leptoquarks (LQ) as a portal to the dark sector to resolve some observational anomalies simultaneously. We introduce LQ coupling to scalar dark matter (DM) to suggest an exotic decay channel for the neutron into scalar DM and an SM anti-neutrino. If the branching ratio of this new neutron decay channel is $1\%$, a long-standing discrepancy in the measured neutron lifetime between two different experimental methods, bottle and beam experiments, can be solved. The mass of the scalar DM produced from neutron decay should be in a narrow range and as a result, its production in the early universe is challenging. We discuss that the freeze-in mechanism can produce this scalar DM in the early universe with the correct relic abundance. Then we show that the model can explain other SM anomalies like the muon $(g-2)$, $R\_{D^{(*)}}$ anomaly, and the tiny neutrino mass simultaneously.

2023-05-02, **Feebly Interacting Particles: FIPs 2022 workshop report**, C. Antel et.al., [2305.01715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01715v1)

 Particle physics today faces the challenge of explaining the mystery of dark matter, the origin of matter over anti-matter in the Universe, the origin of the neutrino masses, the apparent fine-tuning of the electro-weak scale, and many other aspects of fundamental physics. Perhaps the most striking frontier to emerge in the search for answers involves new physics at mass scales comparable to familiar matter, below the GeV-scale, or even radically below, down to sub-eV scales, and with very feeble interaction strength. New theoretical ideas to address dark matter and other fundamental questions predict such feebly interacting particles (FIPs) at these scales, and indeed, existing data provide numerous hints for such possibility. A vibrant experimental program to discover such physics is under way, guided by a systematic theoretical approach firmly grounded on the underlying principles of the Standard Model. This document represents the report of the FIPs 2022 workshop, held at CERN between the 17 and 21 October 2022 and aims to give an overview of these efforts, their motivations, and the decadal goals that animate the community involved in the search for FIPs.

2023-05-02, **Precision CMB constraints on eV-scale bosons coupled to neutrinos**, Stefan Sandner et.al., [2305.01692v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01692v1)

 The cosmic microwave background (CMB) has proven to be an invaluable tool for studying the properties and interactions of neutrinos, providing insight not only into the sum of neutrino masses but also the free streaming nature of neutrinos prior to recombination. The CMB is a particularly powerful probe of new eV-scale bosons interacting with neutrinos, as these particles can thermalize with neutrinos via the inverse decay process, $\nu\bar{\nu} \rightarrow X$, and suppress neutrino free streaming near recombination -- even for couplings as small as $\lambda\_\nu \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$. Here, we revisit CMB constraints on such bosons, improving upon a number of approximations previously adopted in the literature and generalizing the constraints to a broader class of models. This includes scenarios in which the boson is either spin-$0$ or spin-$1$, the number of interacting neutrinos is either $N\_{\rm int} = 1,2 $ or $3$, and the case in which a primordial abundance of the species is present. We apply these bounds to well-motivated models, such as the singlet majoron model or a light $U(1)\_{L\_\mu-L\_\tau}$ gauge boson, and find that they represent the leading constraints for masses $m\_X\sim 1\, {\rm eV}$. Finally, we revisit the extent to which neutrino-philic bosons can ameliorate the Hubble tension, and find that recent improvements in the understanding of how such bosons damp neutrino free streaming reduces the previously found success of this proposal.

2023-05-02, **Dark linear seesaw mechanism**, A. Batra et.al., [2305.01687v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01687v1)

 We propose a minimal model where a dark sector, odd under a $\mathcal{Z}\_2$ discrete symmetry, is the seed of lepton number violation in the neutrino sector at the loop level, in the context of the linear seesaw mechanism. Neutrino mass suppression stems from a naturally small scalar potential coupling which breaks the lepton number symmetry softly. The fact that we consider (dark) Dirac vector-like neutral leptons, prevents the appearance of other mass terms that could contribute to neutrino masses via alternative mechanisms. We study the dark-matter phenomenology of the model, focusing on the case in which the stable particle is the lightest neutral scalar arising from the dark scalar sector. Prospects for testing our framework with the results of current and future lepton flavour violation searches are also discussed.

2023-05-02, **Extended Analysis of Neutrino-Dark Matter Interactions with Small-Scale CMB Experiments**, Philippe Brax et.al., [2305.01383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01383v1)

 We explore an extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by including an interaction between neutrinos and dark matter, and making use of the ground based telescope data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). An indication for a non-zero coupling between dark matter and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$\sigma$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N\_{\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N\_{\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $\nu$DM (+$N\_{\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $\Lambda$CDM (+$N\_{\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of dark matter's interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.

2023-05-02, **Quantum information and quantum simulation of neutrino physics**, A. B. Balantekin et.al., [2305.01150v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01150v1)

 In extreme astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play a major role in driving various dynamical and microphysical phenomena, such as baryonic matter outflows, the synthesis of heavy elements, and the supernova explosion mechanism itself. The interactions of neutrinos with matter in these environments are flavor-specific, which makes it of paramount importance to understand the flavor evolution of neutrinos. Flavor evolution in these environments can be a highly nontrivial problem thanks to a multitude of collective effects in flavor space, arising due to neutrino-neutrino ($\nu$-$\nu$) interactions in regions with high neutrino densities. A neutrino ensemble undergoing flavor oscillations under the influence of significant $\nu$-$\nu$ interactions is somewhat analogous to a system of coupled spins with long-range interactions among themselves and with an external field ('long-range' in momentum-space in the case of neutrinos). As a result, it becomes pertinent to consider whether these interactions can give rise to significant quantum correlations among the interacting neutrinos, and whether these correlations have any consequences for the flavor evolution of the ensemble. In particular, one may seek to utilize concepts and tools from quantum information science and quantum computing to deepen our understanding of these phenomena. In this article, we attempt to summarize recent work in this field. Furthermore, we also present some new results in a three-flavor setting, considering complex initial states.

2023-05-03, **Analysis of Direct and Indirect Detection of Fermionic Dark Matter of 6-Dimensional Effective Field Theory**, Ayşe Elçiboğa Kuday et.al., [2305.02302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02302v1)

 We present an analysis of fermionic dark matter (DM) in the context of 6 dimensional Effective Field Theory (EFT). We also compared the result generated via the 6-dimensional EFT analysis with the current experimental results for dark matter searches. These experiments are methodically categorised as direct and indirect search and present some constraints on dark matter model parameters of 6-dimensional EFT. We constructed a new set of tools ensuring DM researches in various platforms. The model parameters are presented to guide DM production in colliders by taking account of the upper limits at direct and indirect searches. In this paper we apply our approach for fermionic case to test the verification of the method. There are various type of search methods for DM, each depends on type of interaction of dark matter with SM particles. Finally we analysed fermionic DM candidate of 6-dimensional Effective Field Theory (EFT) at the platforms of DM searches. A new set of numerical tools is specified for 6-dimensional fermionic DM model, and these tools are also tested.

2023-05-03, **Hydrodynamic effects on the filtered dark matter produced by a first-order phase transition**, Siyu Jiang et.al., [2305.02218v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02218v1)

 Motivated by current status of dark matter (DM) search, a new type of DM production mechanism is proposed based on the dynamical process of a strong first-order phase transition in the early universe, namely, the filtered DM mechanism. We study the hydrodynamic effects on the DM relic density. By detailed calculations, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic modes with the corresponding hydrodynamic heating effects play essential roles in determining the DM relic density. The corresponding phase transition gravitational wave could help to probe this new mechanism.

2023-05-03, **Impacts of dark matter interaction on nuclear and neutron star matter within the relativistic mean-field model**, H. C. Das et.al., [2305.02065v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02065v1)

 This thesis explores the effects of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. The effects of DM on NS properties, including the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, are calculated by varying its fraction. The study found that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has marginal effects on nuclear matter properties, except for the EOSs and binding energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated, static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The $f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($\Lambda\_{1.4}$) and we have put a constraint on $f$-mode frequency using GW170817 data. Finally, we have calculated the DM admixed binary NS properties and found that the binary system becomes less deformed and sustains more time in its inspiral phases with the addition of DM. Therefore, we suggest that one can take DM inside the compact objects while modeling the inspiral waveforms for the BNS systems.

2023-05-03, **On underestimation of the inelastic interactions in the direct dark matter search**, Vadim A. Bednyakov et.al., [2305.02050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02050v1)

 In the paper expressions are obtained for the event rates expected in experiments aimed at direct detection of dark matter (DM) particles. These expressions allow one to estimate the rates taking into account simultaneously elastic (coherent) and inelastic (incoherent) channels of DM particle interaction with nuclei. The nonzero nuclear excitation energies are used in the calculation of the inelastic scattering contributions. A strong correlation between the excitation energy and the recoil energy of the excited nucleus limits the possibility of the inelastic channel detection with a number of nuclei. Together with the standard model of the DM distribution in the Galaxy some models are considered, which allow higher speeds of the DM particle. As the nuclear recoil energy, TA, increases, the dominance of the elastic interaction channel is smoothly replaced by the dominance of the inelastic one. Therefore, if a detector is set up to detect only elastic scattering events, it starts to lose capability of seeing anything. The only way to notice the interaction remains the gamma radiation from the deexcitation of the nucleus. In the case of spin-independent DM interaction, as TA increases, the inelastic contribution quickly dominates. If the DM particle interacts only spin-dependently, the detectors focused on registration of the elastic spin-dependent DM signal will see nothing, since the signal goes through the inelastic channel. It looks like the desired DM interaction could have a noticeable intensity, but the DM detector is unable to detect it. Therefore, a setup aimed at the direct DM detection should register two signals. The first is the nuclear recoil energy and the second is the gamma-quanta with a certain energy from the target nucleus deexitation. The experiment will provide the complete information about the DM interaction.

2023-05-03, **The self-confinement of electrons and positrons from dark matter**, Marco Regis et.al., [2305.01999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01999v1)

 Radiative emissions from electrons and positrons generated by dark matter (DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect searches of WIMPs. Ideal targets must have large ratio of DM to baryonic matter. However, such ``dark'' systems have a poorly known level of magnetic turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed, they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed approach can be used to set robust and competitive bounds on WIMP DM.

2023-05-03, **Constraining the dark matter interpretation of the positron excess with $γ$-ray data**, Haoxiang Zhan et.al., [2305.01992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01992v1)

 The particle origin of dark matter (DM) is still one of the main puzzles in modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\bar{b}$ it is required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\langle \sigma v \rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s while for $\tau^+\tau^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\langle \sigma v \rangle = 3\times 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper limits derived with the non-detection of $\gamma$ rays with HESS in the direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into $\mu^+ \mu^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\langle \sigma v \rangle = 4\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper limits found with $\gamma$ rays. As for the $\tau^+ \tau^-$ ($b\bar{b}$) channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\%$ (a few \%) level.

2023-05-02, **The Classical Equations of Motion of Quantized Gauge Theories, Part I: General Relativity**, David E. Kaplan et.al., [2305.01798v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01798v1)

 In this and a companion paper, we show that quantum field theories with gauge symmetries permit a broader class of classical dynamics than typically assumed. In this article, we show that the dynamics extracted from the path integral or Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity allows for classical states that do not satisfy the full set of Einstein's equations. This amounts to loosening the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints that are imposed on the initial state. Nevertheless, the quantum theory permits gauge invariant time evolution of these states. The time evolution of these states is such that at the classical level the full set of Einstein's equations would appear to hold, with the physical effects of these states being attributable to an auxiliary, covariantly conserved energy-momentum tensor with no internal degrees of freedom. We derive the generalized Einstein equations for these states and show that a homogeneous and isotropic initial background state contributes to expansion identical to cold dark matter. The inhomogeneous components of this state could source curvature perturbations that grow linearly at linear order. This auxiliary contribution to Einstein's equations could have either sign and thus provide a trivial way to violate the null energy condition, enabling novel gravitational dynamics such as cosmic bounces and wormholes.

2023-05-02, **What can a GNOME do? Search targets for the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches**, S. Afach et.al., [2305.01785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01785v1)

 Numerous observations suggest that there exist undiscovered beyond-the-Standard-Model particles and fields. Because of their unknown nature, these exotic particles and fields could interact with Standard Model particles in many different ways and assume a variety of possible configurations. Here we present an overview of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), our ongoing experimental program designed to test a wide range of exotic physics scenarios. The GNOME experiment utilizes a worldwide network of shielded atomic magnetometers (and, more recently, comagnetometers) to search for spatially and temporally correlated signals due to torques on atomic spins from exotic fields of astrophysical origin. We survey the temporal characteristics of a variety of possible signals currently under investigation such as those from topological defect dark matter (axion-like particle domain walls), axion-like particle stars, solitons of complex-valued scalar fields (Q-balls), stochastic fluctuations of bosonic dark matter fields, a solar axion-like particle halo, and bursts of ultralight bosonic fields produced by cataclysmic astrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers.

2023-05-02, **Baryons, multi-hadron systems, and composite dark matter in non-relativistic QCD**, Benoît Assi et.al., [2305.01685v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01685v1)

 We provide a formulation of potential non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD) suitable for calculating binding energies and matrix elements of generic hadron and multi-hadron states made of heavy quarks in $SU(N\_c)$ gauge theory using quantum Monte Carlo techniques. We compute masses of quarkonium and triply-heavy baryons in order to study the perturbative convergence of pNRQCD and validate our numerical methods. Further, we study $SU(N\_c)$ models of composite dark matter and provide simple power series fits to our pNRQCD results that can be used to relate dark meson and baryon masses to the fundamental parameters of these models. For many systems comprised entirely of heavy quarks, the quantum Monte Carlo methods employed here are less computationally demanding than lattice field theory methods, although they introduce additional perturbative approximations. The formalism presented here may therefore be particularly useful for predicting composite dark matter properties for a wide range of $N\_c$ and heavy fermion masses.

2023-05-02, **The dust enrichment and detectability of early galaxies in the JWST and ALMA era**, Valentin Mauerhofer et.al., [2305.01681v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01681v1)

 Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are yielding tantalizing hints of an early population of massive, bright galaxies at $z > 10$, with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations indicating significant dust masses in place as early as $z\sim 7$. To understand the implications of these observations, we use the DELPHI semi-analytic model that jointly tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their constituent baryons, including the key processes of dust enrichment. Our model employs only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters that are tuned against all available galaxy data at $z \sim 5-9$ before it is used to make predictions up to $z \sim 20$. Our key results are: (1) the model progressively under-predicts the observed ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) at $z > 12$; observations at $z>16$ lie close to, or even above, a "maximal" model where all available gas is turned into stars; (2) UV selection would miss 34% of the star formation rate density at $z \sim 5$, decreasing to 17% by $z \sim 10$ for bright galaxies with $\rm{M\_{UV}} < -19$; (3) the dust mass ($M\_d$) evolves with the stellar mass ($M\_*$) and redshift as $\log(M\_d) = 1.194\log(M\_*) + 0.0975z - 5.433$; (4) the escape fraction of UV photons ($f\_{\rm esc}^{\rm UV}$) decreases with increasing mass and star formation rate. At $z \sim 7$, $f\_{\rm esc}^{\rm UV} \sim 0.8~(0.1)$ for $M\_* \sim 10^9~ (10^{11}) \, M\_\odot$ galaxies; (5) the dust temperature increases with stellar mass, ranging between $30-33$ K for $M\_* \sim 10^{9-11}M\_\odot$ galaxies at $z \sim 7$. Finally, we predict the far infrared (FIR) LF at $z \sim 5-20$, testable with ALMA observations, and caution that spectroscopic redshifts and dust masses must be pinned down before invoking unphysical extrema in galaxy formation models.

2023-05-02, **The dark matter unitarity bound at NLO**, Salvatore Bottaro et.al., [2305.01680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01680v1)

 We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on dark matter freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect dark matter annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the dark matter mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable relativistic UV completion.

2023-05-02, **i-SPin 2: An integrator for general spin-s Gross-Pitaevskii systems**, Mudit Jain et.al., [2305.01675v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01675v1)

 We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii / non-linear Schr\"odinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the $2s+1$ components of the `spinor' field represent the different spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to quartic order in the Schr\"odinger field (both short and long-range, and spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical systems such as self-interacting bosonic dark matter. As examples, we provide results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of spin-$1$ solitons in dark matter. Our symplectic algorithm is second-order accurate in time, and is extensible to the known higher-order accurate methods.

2023-05-02, **A proof of slow-roll local decay of inflaton fields in cosmology and axion fields in cold dark matter models**, Matías Morales et.al., [2305.01495v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01495v1)

 We consider the long time behavior of solutions to scalar field models appearing in the theory of cosmological inflation (oscillons) and cold dark matter, in presence or absence of the cosmological constant. These models are not included in standard mathematical literature due to their unusual nonlinearities, which model different features to classical ones. Here we prove that these models fit in the theory of dispersive decay by computing new virials adapted to their setting. Several important examples, candidates to model both effects are studied in detail.

 We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early matter dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c\_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to dark matter, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such matter dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.

 The consideration of a 1 + 3 covariant approach to cold dark matter universe with no shear cosmological dust model with irrotational flows is developed in the context of f (G) gravity theory in the present study. This approach reveals the existence of integrability conditions which do not appear in non-covariant treatments. We constructed the integrability conditions in modified Gauss-Bonnet f (G) gravity basing on the constraints and propagation equations. These integrability conditions reveal the linearized silent nature of quasi-Newtonian models in f (G) gravity. Finally, the linear equations for the overdensity and velocity perturbations of the quasi-Newtonian space-time were constructed in the context of modified f (G) gravity. The application of harmonic decomposition and redshift transformation techniques to explore the behaviour of the overdensity and velocity perturbations using f (G) model were made. On the other hand we applied the quasi-static approximation to study the approximated solutions on small scales which helps to get both analytical and numerical results of the perturbation equations. The analysis of the energy overdensity and velocity perturbations for both short and long wavelength modes in a dust-Gauss-Bonnet fluids were done and we see that both energy overdensity and velocity perturbations decay with redshift for both modes. In the limits to {\Lambda}CDM , it means f (G) = G the considered f (G) model results coincide with {\Lambda}CDM .

 We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold dark matter model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying dark matter particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the dark matter distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the dark matter model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the dark matter constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.

2023-05-02, **Influence of the deviation of the matter power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal at cosmic dawn**, Yupeng Yang et.al., [2305.01149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01149v1)

 The matter power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the matter power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of dark matter halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if dark matter is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations. Taking into account the dark matter annihilation, we investigate the impact of the deviation of matter power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal. In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m\_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $\delta T\_{21} \le -50~\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.

2023-05-02, **Bayesian analysis for rotational curves with $\ell$-boson stars as a dark matter component**, Atalia Navarro-Boullosa et.al., [2305.01127v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01127v1)

 Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\ell$-boson stars as a dark matter component. The $\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\ell = 0$, $\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.

 We present gas-phase elemental abundance ratios of 7 local extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) including our new Keck/LRIS spectroscopy determinations together with 33 JWST $z\sim 4-10$ star-forming galaxies in the literature, and compare chemical evolution models. We develop chemical evolution models with the yields of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), Type Ia supernovae, hypernovae (HNe), and pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), and compare the EMPGs and high-$z$ galaxies in conjunction with dust depletion contributions. We find that high Fe/O values of EMPGs can (cannot) be explained by PISN metal enrichments (CCSN/HN enrichments even with the mixing-and-fallback mechanism enhancing iron abundance), while that the observed Ar/O and S/O values are much smaller than the predictions of the PISN models. The abundance ratios of the EMPGs can be explained by the combination of Type Ia SNe and CCSNe/HNe whose inner layers of argon and sulfur mostly fallback, which are comparable with Sculptor stellar chemical abundance distribution, suggesting that early chemical enrichment is taken place in the EMPGs. Comparing our chemical evolution models with the star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 4-10$, we find that the Ar/O and S/O ratios of the high-$z$ galaxies are comparable with those of the CCSNe/HNe models, while majority of the high-$z$ galaxies do not have constraints good enough to rule out contributions from PISNe. The high N/O ratio recently reported in GN-z11 cannot be explained even by rotating PISNe, but could be reproduced by the winds of rotating Wolf Rayet stars that end up as a direct collapse.

2023-05-03, **Semi-Parametric Identification and Estimation of Interaction and Effect Modification in Mixed Exposures using Stochastic Interventions**, David B. McCoy et.al., [2305.01849v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01849v1)

 In many fields, including environmental epidemiology, researchers strive to understand the joint impact of a mixture of exposures. This involves analyzing a vector of exposures rather than a single exposure, with the most significant exposure sets being unknown. Examining every possible interaction or effect modification in a high-dimensional vector of candidates can be challenging or even impossible. To address this challenge, we propose a method for the automatic identification and estimation of exposure sets in a mixture with explanatory power, baseline covariates that modify the impact of an exposure and sets of exposures that have synergistic non-additive relationships. We define these parameters in a realistic nonparametric statistical model and use machine learning methods to identify variables sets and estimate nuisance parameters for our target parameters to avoid model misspecification. We establish a prespecified target parameter applied to variable sets when identified and use cross-validation to train efficient estimators employing targeted maximum likelihood estimation for our target parameter. Our approach applies a shift intervention targeting individual variable importance, interaction, and effect modification based on the data-adaptively determined sets of variables. Our methodology is implemented in the open-source SuperNOVA package in R. We demonstrate the utility of our method through simulations, showing that our estimator is efficient and asymptotically linear under conditions requiring fast convergence of certain regression functions. We apply our method to the National Institute of Environmental Health Science mixtures workshop data, revealing correct identification of antagonistic and agonistic interactions built into the data. Additionally, we investigate the association between exposure to persistent organic pollutants and longer leukocyte telomere length.

2023-05-02, **Cosmic acceleration in entropic cosmology**, Javier Chagoya et.al., [2305.01607v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01607v1)

 In this paper we study the viability of an entropic cosmological model. The effects of entropic gravity are derived from a modified entropy-area relationship with a volumetric entropy term. This model describes a late time limit {cosmic acceleration}, whose origin is related to a volumetric term in the entropy. Moreover, we analyze the phenomenological implications of the entropic model using the Supernovae {\it Pantheon} compilation and the observational Hubble parameter data to find consistency with cosmological observations. Finally, we show the equivalence between the entropic model and a brane world cosmological model, by means of an effective geometrical construction.
