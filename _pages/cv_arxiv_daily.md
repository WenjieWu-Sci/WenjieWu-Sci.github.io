2023-09-25, **Rare tau decays via exchange of on-shell almost degenerate Majorana neutrinos, $τ^{\mp} \to π^{\mp} N_j \to π^{\mp} μ^{\mp} π^{\pm}$ and $τ^{\mp} \to π^{\mp} N_j \to π^{\mp} μ^{\pm} π^{\mp}$**, Gorazd Cvetic et.al., [2309.14281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14281v1)

 We investigate rare decays of tau leptons that occur via exchange of heavy on-shell neutrinos $N\_j$ ($j=1,2$). These neutrinos can be either Dirac or Majorana, and are considered to be almost degenerate in mass. The decays can thus be either lepton number conserving (LNC), $\tau^{\mp} \to \pi^{\mp} N\_j \to \pi^{\mp} \mu^{\mp} \pi^{\pm}$, or lepton number violating (LNV), $\tau^{\mp} \to \pi^{\mp} N\_j \to \pi^{\mp} \mu^{\pm} \pi^{\mp}$. If neutrinos are Dirac, only LNC decays are possible. If they are Majorana, both LNC and LNV are possible. We derive the corresponding expressions for the effective decay widths $\Gamma\_{{\rm eff},\mp}^{\rm (X)}$ (X=LNC, LNV) of these rare decays, where we account for $N\_1$-$N\_2$ overlap and oscillation effects and for the finite detector length effects. We then numerically evaluate these decay widths as well as the related CP violation asymmetry width $\Delta \Gamma\_{\rm CP}^{\rm (X)} = (\Gamma\_{{\rm eff},-}^{\rm (X)} - \Gamma\_{{\rm eff},+}^{\rm (X)})$. We conclude that for certain, presently allowed, ranges of the heavy-light neutrino mixing parameters, such decays and asymmetries could be observed in Belle II experiment.

 I present the production of matter and radiation during reheating after inflation, considering only gravitational interactions between the inflaton background and the other sectors. Processes considered are the following: i) the exchange of a graviton, $h\_{\mu \nu}$, involved in the scattering of the inflaton or particles in the newly created radiation bath; ii) scattering of the inflaton background and particles in the radiation bath including the effects of non-minimal couplings to curvature of the Higgs boson and the inflaton. Requiring the existence of heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHN), I show that a minimal scenario utilizing only these "gravitational portals" is able to generate simultaneously the observed relic density of Dark Matter (DM), the baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis, as well as a sufficiently hot thermal bath after inflation, for generic models of large field inflation.

2023-09-25, **Texture zeros realization in a three-loop radiative neutrino mass model from modular $A_4$ symmetry**, Takaaki Nomura et.al., [2309.13921v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13921v1)

 We derive verifiable two-zero textures in the framework of a three-loop induced neutrino mass model applying a modular $A\_4$ symmetry for the lepton sector. Interestingly, the neutrino mass structure is determined by assignments of the right-handed charged-lepton particles only. We show all the possible texture patterns and demonstrate their analytical and numerical analyses. Finally, we mention a possibility of detection for doubly-charged boson via colliders that decays into specific modes due to the flavor symmetry.

2023-09-25, **Modern Software Development for JUNO offline software**, Tao Lin et.al., [2309.13780v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13780v1)

 The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), under construction in South China, primarily aims to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and to precise measure the neutrino oscillation parameters. The data-taking is expected to start in 2024 and the detector plans to run for more than 20 years. The development of the JUNO offline software (JUNOSW) started in 2012, and it is quite challenging to maintain the JUNOSW for such a long time. In the last ten years, tools such as Subversion, Trac, and CMT had been adopted for software development. However, new stringent requirements came out, such as how to reduce the building time for the whole project, how to deploy offline algorithms to an online environment, and how to improve the code quality with code review and continuous integration. To meet the further requirements of software development, modern development tools are evaluated for JUNOSW, such as Git, GitLab, CMake, Docker, and Kubernetes. This contribution will present the software development system based on these modern tools for JUNOSW and the functionalities achieved: CMake macros are developed to simplify the build instructions for users; CMake generator expressions are used to control the build flags for the online and offline environments; a tool named git-junoenv is developed to help users partially checkout and build the software; a script is used to build and deploy the software on the CVMFS server; a Docker image with CVMFS client installed is created for continuous integration; a GitLab agent is set up to manage GitLab runners in Kubernetes with all the configurations in a GitLab repository.

2023-09-24, **Probing Schwarzschild-like Black Holes in Metric-Affine Bumblebee Gravity with Accretion Disk, Deflection Angle, Greybody Bounds, and Neutrino Propagation**, G. Lambiase et.al., [2309.13594v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13594v1)

 In this paper, we investigate Schwarzschild-like black holes within the framework of metric-affine bumblebee gravity. We explore the implications of such a gravitational setup on various astrophysical phenomena, including the presence of an accretion disk, the deflection angle of light rays, the establishment of greybody bounds, and the propagation of neutrinos. The metric-affine bumblebee gravity theory offers a unique perspective on gravitational interactions by introducing a vector field that couples to spacetime curvature. We analyze the behavior of accretion disks around Schwarzschild-like black holes in this modified gravity scenario, considering the effects of the bumblebee field on the accretion process. Furthermore, we scrutinize the deflection angle of light rays as they traverse the gravitational field, highlighting potential deviations from standard predictions due to the underlying metric-affine structure. Investigating greybody bounds in this context sheds light on the thermal radiation emitted by black holes and how the modified gravity framework influences this phenomenon. Moreover, we explore neutrino propagation around Schwarzschild-like black holes within metric-affine bumblebee gravity, examining alterations in neutrino trajectories and interactions compared to conventional general relativity. By comprehensively probing these aspects, we aim to unravel the distinctive features and consequences of Schwarzschild-like black holes in the context of metric-affine bumblebee gravity, offering new insights into the nature of gravitational interactions and their observable signatures.

 MOND theory has arisen as a promising alternative to dark matter in explaining the collection of discrepancies that constitute the so-called missing mass problem. The MOND paradigm is briefly reviewed. It is shown that MOND theory can be incorporated into the framework of Matrix General Relativity. In particular, we demonstrate that Matrix General Relativity contains MOND as a particular case.

2023-09-25, **Primary scintillation yield in gaseous Xe for electrons and alpha-particles**, C. A. O. Henriques et.al., [2309.14202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14202v1)

 Xenon scintillation has been widely used in rare event detection experiments, such as in neutrinoless double beta decay, double electron capture and dark matter searches. Nonetheless, experimental values for primary scintillation yield in gaseous xenon (GXe) remain scarce and dispersed. The mean energy required to produce a scintillation photon, w\_sc in GXe in the absence of recombination has been measured to be in the range of 34-111 eV. Lower w\_sc-values are often reported for alpha-particles when compared to electrons produced by gamma- or x-rays, being this difference not understood. We carried out a systematic study on the absolute primary scintillation yield in GXe under reduced electric fields in the 70-300 V/cm/bar range and near atmospheric pressure, 1.2 bar, supported by a robust geometrical efficiency simulation model.   Neglecting the 3rd continuum emission, a mean w\_sc-value of 38.7 [+- 0.6 (sta.)] [(- 7.2) (+ 7.7) (sys.)] eV was obtained for x/gamma-rays in the 5.9-60 keV energy range and alpha-particles in the 1.5-2.5 MeV range, no significant dependency neither on radiation type nor on energy has been observed. If the Xe 3rd continuum emission is to be considered, the average energy to produce a 2nd and a 3rd continuum photon was calculated as w\_2nd = 43.5 [+- 0.7 (sta.)][(- 8.1)(+ 8.7) (sys.)] eV and w\_3rd = 483 [+- 7 (sta.)][(- 105)(+ 110) (sys.)] eV, respectively, while the energy to produce either a 3rd or a 2nd continuum photon is w\_(2nd + 3rd) = 39.9 [+- 0.6 (sta.)] [(- 7.4) (+ 8.0) (sys.)] eV.   Our experimental w\_sc-values agree with both state-of-art simulations and literature data obtained for alpha-particles. The discrepancy between our results and the experimental values found in the literature for x/gamma-rays is discussed and attributed to undressed large systematic errors in previous studies.

2023-09-25, **Observational constraints on interactions between dark energy and dark matter with momentum and energy transfers**, Xiaolin Liu et.al., [2309.13946v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13946v1)

 We place observational constraints on a dark energy (DE) model in which a quintessence scalar field $\phi$ is coupled to dark matter (DM) through momentum and energy exchanges. The momentum transfer is weighed by an interaction between the field derivative and DM four velocity with a coupling constant $\beta$, whereas the energy exchange is characterized by an exponential scalar-field coupling to the DM density with a coupling constant $Q$. A positive coupling $\beta$ leads to the suppression for the growth of DM density perturbations at low redshifts, whose property offers a possibility for resolving the $\sigma\_8$ tension problem. A negative coupling $Q$ gives rise to a $\phi$-matter-dominated epoch, whose presence can reduce the sound horizon around the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) decoupling epoch. Using the data of Planck 2018, 12-th Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Phantheon supernovae samples, and 1-year dark energy survey, we find that the two couplings are constrained to be $\beta=0.417^{+1.592}\_{-0.307}$ and $Q =-0.036^{+0.036}\_{-0.010}$ at 68\,\% confidence level (CL). Thus, there is an interesting observational signature of the momentum exchange ($\beta \neq 0$) between DE and DM, with a peak of the probability distribution of the energy transfer coupling at $Q<0$.

2023-09-25, **Radiopurity of NaI(Tl) crystals for PICOLON dark matter experiment**, K. Kotera et.al., [2309.13941v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13941v1)

 The dark matter observation claim by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration has been a long-standing puzzle within the particle physics community. Efforts of other research groups to verify the claim have been insufficient by significant radioactivity of present NaI(Tl) crystals. PICOLON (Pure Inorganic Crystal Observatory for LOw-energy Neut(ra)lino) experiment conducts independent search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) using NaI(Tl) crystals. Our NaI(Tl) crystal manufactured in 2020 (Ingot #85) reached the same purity level as DAMA/LIBRA crystals. In this report, we describe the radiopurity of the new Ingot #94 crystal produced using the same purification technique as Ingot #85. The $\alpha$-ray events were selected by pulse-shape discrimination method. The impurities in the Ingot #94, $^{232}$Th, $^{226}$Ra and $^{210}$Po radioactivity were $4.6\pm 1.2~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, $7.9\pm 4.4~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, and $19\pm 6~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, which are equivalent to those of the DAMA/LIBRA crystals. The background rate in the energy region of 2-6 keV , was 2-5 events/d/kg/keV without applying a veto trigger.

2023-09-25, **Challenges for the directional dark matter direct detection**, Kentaro Miuchi et.al., [2309.13923v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13923v1)

 Directional methods have been considered to provide a solid proof for the direct detection of the dark matter. Gaseous time-projection-chambers (TPCs) are the most mature devices for directional dark matter searches although there still exist several challenges to overcome. This paper reviews the history, current challenges and future prospects of the gaseous TPCs for directional dark matter searches.

2023-09-24, **Charged black holes with dark halos**, Cristian Stelea et.al., [2309.13651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13651v1)

 Recently, Cardoso et al. constructed an exact solution of Einstein's equations that describes a supermassive black hole immersed into a dark matter halo. In this work use a solution-generating technique, which is a direct generalization of some of the Ehlers-Harrison transformation in the Ehlers formalism in order to construct in an exact analytical form the charged version of the Cardoso et al. solution. We describe some of its physical properties and, finally, we also present its magnetized version.

2023-09-24, **R2D2 TPC: first Xenon results**, R. Bouet et.al., [2309.13637v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13637v1)

 Radial time projection chambers (TPC), already employed in the search for rare phenomena such as light Dark Matter candidate, could provide a new detection approach for the search of neutrinoless double beta decay ($\beta\beta0\nu$). The assessment of the performances of such a detector for $\beta\beta0\nu$ search is indeed the goal of the Rare Decays with Radial Detector (R2D2) R\&D. Promising results operating a spherical TPC with argon up to 1~bar have been published in 2021. Supplementary measurements were recently taken extending the gas pressure range up to 3~bar. In addition, a comparison between two detector geometries, namely spherical (SPC for spherical proportional counter) and cylindrical (CPC for cylindrical proportional counter), was performed. Using a relatively simple gas purification system the CPC detector was also operated with xenon at 1~bar: an energy resolution of 1.4\% full-width at half-maximum was achieved for drift distances up to 17~cm. Much lower resolution was observed with the SPC. These results are presented in this article.

2023-09-24, **Multi-stream radial structure of cold dark matter haloes from particle trajectories: deep inside splashback radius**, Yohsuke Enomoto et.al., [2309.13560v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13560v1)

 By tracking trajectories of dark matter (DM) particles accreting onto halos in cosmological $N$-body simulations, we investigate the radial phase-space distribution of cold dark matter (CDM) halos, paying a special attention to their inner regions deep inside the halo boundary called the splashback radius, where the particles undergo multi-stream flows. Extending and improving previous work by Sugiura et al., we classify DM particles inside haloes by the number of apocenter passages, $p$, and succeed to count it up to $p=40$ for each halo over a wide mass range. Quantifying in particular the radial density profile for particles having the same value of $p$, we find that it generally exhibits a double-power law feature, whose indices of inner and outer slopes are well-described by $-1$ and $-8$, respectively. The characteristic density and scale of their double-power law profiles are given as a simple fitting function of $p$, with a weak halo mass dependence. Interestingly, summing up these double-power law functions beyond $p=40$ gives a converged result, which closely matches the total density profile of simulated haloes. The double-power law nature is shown to be persistent and generic not only in mass-selected haloes but also in haloes selected in different criteria. Our results are compared with a class of self-similar solutions that describes the stationary and spherical accretion of DM, and found that even introducing a non-zero angular momentum fails to reproduce the radial multi-stream structure. The analysis with particle trajectories tracing back to higher redshifts suggests that the double-power law nature have been established during an early accretion phase and remain stable.

2023-09-25, **Analyzing a higher order $q(t)$ model and its implications in the late evolution of the Universe using recent observational datasets**, Madhur Khurana et.al., [2309.14222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14222v1)

 In this research paper, we explore a well-motivated parametrization of the time-dependent deceleration parameter, characterized by a cubic form, within the context of late time cosmic acceleration. The current analysis is based on the $f(Q,T)$ gravity theory, by considering the background metric as the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann Lema\^itre Robertson Walker (FLRW) metric. Investigating the model reveals intriguing features of the late universe. To constrain the model, we use the recent observational datasets, including cosmic chronometer (CC), Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB), Gamma Ray Burst (GRB), and Quasar (Q) datasets. The joint analysis of these datasets results in tighter constraints for the model parameters, enabling us to discuss both the physical and geometrical aspects of the model. Moreover, we determine the present values of the deceleration parameter ($q\_0$), the Hubble parameter ($H\_0$), and the transition redshift ($z\_t$) from deceleration to acceleration ensuring consistency with some recent results of Planck 2018. Our statistical analysis yields highly improved results, surpassing those obtained in previous investigations. Overall, this study presents valuable insights into the higher order $q(t)$ model and its implications for late-time cosmic acceleration, shedding light on the nature of the late universe.

2023-09-25, **Numerical studies on the link between radioisotopic signatures on Earth and the formation of the Local Bubble. II. Advanced modeling of interstellar 26Al, 53Mn, 60Fe, and 244Pu influxes as traces of past supernovae in the solar neighborhood**, Michael Mathias Schulreich et.al., [2309.13983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13983v1)

 Measurements of long-lived radioisotopes provide a means, completely independent of other observational channels, to draw conclusions about near-Earth supernovae (SNe) and thus the origin of the Local Bubble (LB). First and foremost in this context is 60Fe, which has already been detected across the Earth and on the Moon. Using Gaia EDR3, we identified 14 SN explosions, with 13 occurring in UCL/LCC, and one in V1062 Sco, all being subgroups of the Sco-Cen OB association. The timing of these explosions was obtained by us through interpolation of rotating stellar evolution tracks via the initial masses of the already exploded massive stars. We further developed a new Monte Carlo-type approach for deriving the trajectories of the SN progenitors. We then performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations based on these initial conditions to explore the evolution of the LB in an inhomogeneous local interstellar medium and the transport of radioisotopes to Earth. The simulations include the stellar winds from the SN progenitors and additional radioisotopes (26Al, 53Mn, and 244Pu) besides 60Fe. We find that (i) our simulations are consistent with measurements of 60Fe, in particular, a peak 2-3 Myr before present, as well as 26Al, 53Mn, and 244Pu data, (ii) stellar winds contribute to the distribution of radioisotopes and also to the dynamics of the LB, (iii) the solar system (SS) entered the LB about 4.6 Myr ago, and (iv) the measured recent influx of 60Fe can be naturally explained by turbulent radioisotopic transport. Our simulations not only support the recent hypothesis that the LB triggered star formation in the solar vicinity through its expansion, but also suggest that the second, separate 60Fe peak measured at 6-9 Myr ago was generated by the passage of the SS through a neighboring superbubble (SB), possibly the Orion-Eridanus SB, prior to its current residence in the LB.

2023-09-25, **Pulsar Scintillation through Thick and Thin: Bow Shocks, Bubbles, and the Broader Interstellar Medium**, S. K. Ocker et.al., [2309.13809v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13809v1)

 Observations of pulsar scintillation are among the few astrophysical probes of very small-scale ($\lesssim$ au) phenomena in the interstellar medium (ISM). In particular, characterization of scintillation arcs, including their curvature and intensity distributions, can be related to interstellar turbulence and potentially over-pressurized plasma in local ISM inhomogeneities, such as supernova remnants, HII regions, and bow shocks. Here we present a survey of eight pulsars conducted at the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), revealing a diverse range of scintillation arc characteristics at high sensitivity. These observations reveal more arcs than measured previously for our sample. At least nine arcs are observed toward B1929$+$10 at screen distances spanning $\sim 90\%$ of the pulsar's $361$ pc path-length to the observer. Four arcs are observed toward B0355$+$54, with one arc yielding a screen distance as close as $\sim10^5$ au ($<1$ pc) from either the pulsar or the observer. Several pulsars show highly truncated, low-curvature arcs that may be attributable to scattering near the pulsar. The scattering screen constraints are synthesized with continuum maps of the local ISM and other well-characterized pulsar scintillation arcs, yielding a three-dimensional view of the scattering media in context.

2023-09-24, **Tests of subgrid models for star formation using simulations of isolated disk galaxies**, Folkert S. J. Nobels et.al., [2309.13750v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13750v1)

 We use smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated Milky Way-mass disk galaxies that include cold, interstellar gas to test subgrid prescriptions for star formation (SF). Our fiducial model combines a Schmidt law with a gravitational instability criterion, but we also test density thresholds and temperature ceilings. While SF histories are insensitive to the prescription for SF, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relations between SF rate and gas surface density can discriminate between models. We show that our fiducial model, with an SF efficiency per free-fall time of 1 per cent, agrees with spatially-resolved and azimuthally-averaged observed KS relations for neutral, atomic and molecular gas. Density thresholds do not perform as well. While temperature ceilings selecting cold, molecular gas can match the data for galaxies with solar metallicity, they are unsuitable for very low-metallicity gas and hence for cosmological simulations. We argue that SF criteria should be applied at the resolution limit rather than at a fixed physical scale, which means that we should aim for numerical convergence of observables rather than of the properties of gas labelled as star-forming. Our fiducial model yields good convergence when the mass resolution is varied by nearly 4 orders of magnitude, with the exception of the spatially-resolved molecular KS relation at low surface densities. For the gravitational instability criterion, we quantify the impact on the KS relations of gravitational softening, the SF efficiency, and the strength of supernova feedback, as well as of observable parameters such as the inclusion of ionized gas, the averaging scale, and the metallicity.

2023-09-24, **Discovery of a one-sided radio filament of PSR J0538+2813 in S147: escape of relativistic PWN leptons into surrounding supernova remnant?**, Ildar Khabibullin et.al., [2309.13670v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13670v1)

 We report the discovery of a faint radio filament near PSR J0538+2813 in the NVSS, CGPS, and the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey data. This pulsar is plausibly associated with the supernova that gave rise to the Spaghetti Nebula (Simeis 147). The structure is one-sided and appears to be almost aligned (within 17 degrees) with the direction of the pulsar's proper motion, but in contrast to the known cases of pulsar radio tails, it is located ahead of the pulsar. At the same time, this direction is also approximately (within 5 degrees) perpendicular to the axis of the extended non-thermal X-ray emission around the pulsar. No X-ray or optical emission is detected from the filament region, although the end point of the radio filament appears to be adjacent to a filament of H$\_\alpha$ emission. We speculate that this structure might represent a filament connecting pulsar wind nebula with the ambient interstellar medium filled with relativistic electrons escaping the pulsar nebula, i.e. a radio analogue of X-ray filaments of Guitar and Lighthouse PWNs and filaments of non-thermal radio emission in the Galactic Center.

2023-09-24, **Determining cosmological-model-independent $H_0$ and post-Newtonian parameter with time-delay lenses and supernovae**, Tonghua Liu et.al., [2309.13608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13608v1)

 Strong gravitational lensing provides a natural opportunity to test General Relativity (GR). We propose a model-independent method for simultaneous constraining on Hubble constant ($H\_0$) and post-Newtonian parameter (${\gamma\_{\rm{PPN}}}$) using strong lensing systems and observational SNe Ia. The time-delay measurements from strong lesning can directly determine the Hubble constant, and the lens distance inferred from the spectroscopic measurement of the stellar kinematics of the deflector galaxy can help us to constrain the post-Newtonian parameter. We seek the Pantheon dataset and reconstruct unanchored distances using Gaussian process regression to achieve the cosmological model-independent GR testing instead of assuming a specific model, which can reduce possible bias on GR testing and measurement of Hubble constant. Combining the reconstructed unanchored distances and the four H0LiCOW lenses datasets, our results are $H\_0=72.9^{+2.0}\_{-2.3} {\mathrm{~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ and ${\gamma\_{\rm{PPN}}}=0.89^{+0.17}\_{-0.15}$. All the lenses show that there is no obvious evidence to support GR deviation within observational uncertainties. In the subsequent analysis, we consider a ratio of distance ${D\_{\Delta t}}/{D^{'}\_{d}}$ method to further avoid the influence of $H\_0$ on GR testing. The results show that, except J1206 within the $\sim1.2\sigma$ observational uncertainty, the remaining 3 lenses support GR holds within the $1\sigma$ observational uncertainties.
