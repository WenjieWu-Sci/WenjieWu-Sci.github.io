2023-05-18, **Cogenesis of matter and dark matter from triplet fermion seesaw**, Satyabrata Mahapatra et.al., [2305.11138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11138v1)

 We propose a simple model in the type-III seesaw framework to explain the recently reported W-mass anomaly by CDF-II collaboration, neutrino mass, asymmetric dark matter, and baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We extend the standard model with a vector-like singlet lepton ($\chi$) and a hypercharge zero scalar triplet ($\Delta$) in addition to three hypercharge zero triplet fermions($\Sigma\_i~,i=1,2,3$). A $Z\_2$ symmetry is imposed under which $\chi$ and $\Delta$ are odd, while all other particles are even. As a result, the lightest $Z\_2$ odd particle $\chi$ behaves as a candidate of dark matter. In the early Universe, the CP-violating out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy triplet fermions to the Standard Model lepton ($L$) and Higgs ($H$) generate a net lepton asymmetry, while that of triplet fermions to $\chi$ and $\Delta$ generate a net asymmetric dark matter. The lepton asymmetry is converted to the required baryon asymmetry of the Universe via the electroweak sphalerons, while the asymmetry in $\chi$ remains as a dark matter relic that we observe today. We introduce a singlet scalar $\phi$, with mass $m\_\phi < m\_\chi$, which not only assists to deplete the symmetric component of $\chi$ through the annihilation process: $\bar{\chi} \chi \to \phi \phi$ but also paves a path to detect dark matter $\chi$ at direct search experiments through $\phi-H$ mixing. The $Z\_2$ symmetry is broken softly resulting in an unstable asymmetric dark matter with mass ranging from a few MeV to a few tens of GeV. The softly broken $Z\_2$ symmetry also induces a vacuum expectation value (vev) of $\Delta$ due to which the asymmetry in $\Delta$ disappears. Moreover, the vev of $\Delta$ enhances the W-boson mass as reported by CDF-II collaboration with $7\sigma$ statistical significance, while keeping the $Z$-boson mass intact.

2023-05-18, **Production of $p$-nuclei from $r$-process seeds: the $νr$-process**, Zewei Xiong et.al., [2305.11050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11050v1)

 We present a new nucleosynthesis process that may take place on neutron-rich ejecta experiencing an intensive neutrino flux. The nucleosynthesis proceeds similarly to the standard $r$-process, a sequence of neutron-captures and beta-decays, however with charged-current neutrino absorption reactions on nuclei operating much faster than beta-decays. Once neutron capture reactions freeze-out the produced $r$-process neutron-rich nuclei undergo a fast conversion of neutrons into protons and are pushed even beyond the $\beta$-stability line producing the neutron-deficient $p$-nuclei. This scenario, which we denote as the $\nu r$-process, provides an alternative channel for the production of $p$-nuclei and the short-lived nucleus $^{92}$Nb. We discuss the necessary conditions posed on the astrophysical site for the $\nu r$-process to be realized in nature. While these conditions are not fulfilled by current neutrino-hydrodynamic models of $r$-process sites, future models, including more complex physics and a larger variety of outflow conditions, may achieve the necessary conditions in some regions of the ejecta.

2023-05-18, **Probing Non-Standard Neutrino Interactions with Interference: Insights from Dark Matter and Neutrino Experiments**, Jong-Chul Park et.al., [2305.10836v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10836v1)

 Neutrino-electron scattering experiments play a crucial role in investigating the non-standard interactions of neutrinos. In certain models, these interactions can include interference terms that may affect measurements. Next-generation direct detection experiments, designed primarily for dark-matter searches, are also getting sensitive to probe the neutrino properties. We utilise the data from XENONnT, a direct detection experiment, and Borexino, a low-energy solar neutrino experiment, to investigate the impact of interference on non-standard interactions. Our study considers models with an additional $U(1)$, including $U(1)\_{B-L}$, $U(1)\_{L\_e-L\_\mu}$, and $U(1)\_{L\_e-L\_\tau}$, to investigate the impact of interference on non-standard neutrino interactions. We demonstrate that this interference can lead to a transition between the considered non-standard interaction models in the energy range relevant to both the XENONnT and Borexino experiments. This transition can be used to distinguish among the considered models if any signals are observed at direct detection or neutrino experiments. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for the interference and incorporating both direct detection and solar neutrino experiments to gain a better understanding of neutrino interactions and properties.

2023-05-18, **Bubble-assisted Leptogenesis**, Eung Jin Chun et.al., [2305.10759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10759v1)

 The typical mass scale of the lightest right-handed neutrino (RHN), in the thermal leptogenesis paradigm, is bounded from below at about $10^{11} \text{ GeV}$ due to a "strong washout" of the final asymmetry without a tuning of parameters. In this work, we explore the possibility of embedding thermal leptogenesis within a first-order phase transition (FOPT) such that RHNs remain massless until a FOPT arises. Their sudden and violent mass gain allows the neutrinos to become thermally decoupled, and the lepton asymmetry generated from their decay can be, in principle, free from the strong wash-out processes that conventional leptogenesis scenarios suffer from, albeit at the cost of new washout channels. We numerically quantify to what extent such a framework can alleviate strong-washout effects and we find the lower bound on the RHN mass, $M\_N \sim 10^{7}\text{ GeV}$, below which bubble-assisted leptogenesis cannot provide an enhancement. We also study the signature possibly observable at GW terrestrial interferometers and conclude that bubble-assisted leptogenesis models with relatively light masses, $M\_N \lesssim 5\times 10^9 \text{ GeV}$ may be probable.

2023-05-18, **Lepto-hadronic interpretation of 2021 RS Ophiuchi nova outburst**, Agnibha De Sarkar et.al., [2305.10735v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10735v1)

 Very high energy (VHE; 100 GeV $<$ E $\leq$ 100 TeV) and high energy (HE; 100 MeV $<$ E $\leq$ 100 GeV) gamma-rays were observed from the symbiotic recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) during its outburst in August 2021, by various observatories such as High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC), and {\it Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT). The models explored so far tend to favor a hadronic scenario of particle acceleration over an alternative leptonic scenario. This paper explores a time-dependent lepto-hadronic scenario to explain the emission from the RS Oph source region. We have used simultaneous low frequency radio data observed by various observatories, along with the data provided by H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and \textit{Fermi}-LAT, to explain the multi-wavelength (MWL) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) corresponding to 4 days after the outburst. Our results show that a lepto-hadronic interpretation of the source not only explains the observed HE-VHE gamma-ray data but the corresponding model synchrotron component is also consistent with the first 4 days of low radio frequency data, indicating the presence of non-thermal radio emission at the initial stage of nova outburst. We have also calculated the expected neutrino flux from the source region and discussed the possibility of detecting neutrinos.

2023-05-18, **Lepton flavor violating decays $l_j\rightarrow l_i γγ$**, Ming-Yue Liu et.al., [2305.10663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10663v1)

 In this paper, we study the lepton flavor violating decays (LFV) of the $l\_j\rightarrow l\_i \gamma\gamma$ (j=2, 3; i=1, 2) processes under the $U(1)\_X$SSM model. The $U(1)\_X$SSM is the addition of three singlet new Higgs superfields and right-handed neutrinos to the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM). Based on the latest experimental constraints of $l\_j\rightarrow l\_i \gamma\gamma$, we analyze the effects of different sensitive parameters on the results and made reasonable predictions for future experimental development. Numerical analysis shows that many parameters have a greater or lesser effect on LFV, but the main sensitive parameters and sources leading to LFV are the non-diagonal elements involving the initial and final leptons. This work could provide a basis for the discovery of the existence of new physics (NP).

2023-05-17, **The LHAASO PeVatron bright sky: what we learned**, Martina Cardillo et.al., [2305.10526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10526v1)

 The recent detection of 12 gamma-ray Galactic sources well above E > 100 TeV by the LHAASO observatory has been a breakthrough in the context of Cosmic Ray (CR) origin search. Although most of these sources are unidentified, they are often spatially correlated with leptonic accelerators, like pulsar and pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). This dramatically affects the paradigm for which a gamma-ray detection at E > 100 TeV implies the presence of a hadronic accelerator of PeV particles (PeVatron). Moreover, the LHAASO results support the idea that sources other than the standard candidates, Supernova Remnants, can accelerate Galactic CRs. In this context, the good angular resolution of future Cherenkov telescopes, such as the ASTRI Mini-Array and CTA, and the higher sensitivity of future neutrino detectors, such as KM3NeT and IceCube-Gen2, will be of crucial importance. In this brief review, we want to summarize the efforts done up to now, from both theoretical and experimental points of view, to fully understand the LHAASO results in the context of the CR acceleration issue.

2023-05-17, **The Photon Content of the Neutron**, Keping Xie et.al., [2305.10497v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10497v1)

 In this work, we complete our CT18qed study with the neutron's photon parton distribution function (PDF), which is essential for the nucleus scattering phenomenology. Two methods, CT18lux and CT18qed, based on the LUXqed formalism and the DGLAP evolution, respectively, to determine the neutron's photon PDF have been presented. Various low-$Q^2$ non-perturbative variations have been carefully examined, which are treated as additional uncertainties on top of those induced by quark and gluon PDFs. The impacts of the momentum sum rule as well as isospin symmetry violation have been explored, and turn out to be negligible. A detailed comparison with other neutron's photon PDF sets has been performed, which shows a great improvement in the precision and a reasonable uncertainty estimation in our results. Finally, two phenomenological implications are demonstrated with photon-initiated processes: neutrino-nucleus $W$-boson production, which is important for the near-future TeV--PeV neutrino observations, and the axion-like particle production at a high-energy muon beam-dump experiment.

2023-05-17, **Atmospheric Neutrino Octant from Flavour Symmetry**, Claudio Coriano et.al., [2305.10463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10463v1)

 The binary tetrahedral group ($T^{'}$) has provided the most successful flavour symmetry in understanding simultaneously the three mixing angles both for quarks in the CKM matrix and for neutrinos in the PMNS matrix. One prediction, invariant under leptonic CP violation, relates the atmospheric and reactor neutrino mixings $\theta\_{23}$ and $\theta\_{13}$ respectively. We study sedulously this relation using the latest neutrino data. It is natural to focus on the frustrating experimental octant ambiguity of $\theta\_{23}$. We conclude that the flavour symmetry requires that $\theta\_{23}$ is in the second octant $\theta > 45^0$, not in the first one $\theta\_{23}<45^0$, and eagerly await experimental confirmation of this prediction.

2023-05-17, **Looking forward to photon-coupled long-lived particles II: dark axion portal**, Krzysztof Jodłowski et.al., [2305.10409v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10409v1)

 The dark axion portal is a dimension-5 coupling between an axion-like particle (ALP), a photon, and a dark photon, which is one of the targets of the intensity frontier searches looking for $\sim\,$sub-GeV long-lived particles (LLPs). In this work, we re-examine the limits set by existing detectors such as CHARM and NuCal, and by future experiments such as FASER2, MATHUSLA, and SHiP. We extend previous works by i) considering several mass regimes of the Dark Sector (DS) particles, leading to an extended lifetime regime of the unstable species, ii) including LLPs production occurring in previously neglected vector meson decays that actually dominate the LLP yield, and iii) by implementing secondary LLP production. It takes place by Primakoff-like upscattering of lighter DS species into LLP on tungsten layers of neutrino emulsion detector FASER$\nu$2. This process will allow FASER2 to cover a significant portion of the $\gamma c\tau \sim 1\,m$ region of the parameter space that is otherwise difficult to cover due to the large ($\sim O(100)\,m$) distance between the primary LLP production point and the decay vessel, where LLP decays take place, which is required in typical beam-dumb experiments for SM background suppression.

2023-05-17, **Effects of Kaluza-Klein Neutrinos on $R_{D}$ and $R_{D^{*}}$**, Janus Capellan Aban et.al., [2305.10305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10305v1)

 Recent measurements of $R\_{D}$ and $R\_{D^{*}}$ by the LHCb collaboration show deviations from their respective Standard Model values. These semileptonic $B$ meson decays, associated with $b\rightarrow c \tau \bar{\nu}$ transition, are pointing toward new physics beyond the Standard Model via leptonic flavor universality violation. In this paper, we show that such anomaly can be resolved by the cummulative Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of singlet right-handed neutrino which propagates in the large extra dimensional space. We found that the number of extra dimension should be 2 to explain $R\_{D}$ and $R\_{D^{*}}$. We show that both $R\_{D}$ and $R\_{D^{*}}$ constraint the energy scale $M\_{F}$ of this extra dimension which are compatible with the limits from lepton flavor violating tau decays. In contrast, our findings are in tension with the limits coming from the neutrino experiments which set the most stringent lower bound on $M\_{F}$. The future measurements of $R\_{D^{(*)}}^{exp}$ with reduced uncertainties will exclude this extra dimensional model with right-handed neutrino propagating in the bulk, if the central values stay.

2023-05-17, **Model of Cosmic Ray Propagation in the Milky Way at the Knee**, G. Giacinti et.al., [2305.10251v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10251v1)

 We present a new model of anisotropic cosmic ray propagation in the Milky Way, where cosmic rays are injected at discrete transient sources in the disc and propagated in the Galactic magnetic field. In the framework of our model, we show that the cosmic ray spectrum is time-dependent and space-dependent around the energy of the knee. It has a major contribution of one or a few nearby recent sources at any given location in the Galaxy, in particular at the position of the Solar system. We find that the distribution of $\sim$ PeV cosmic rays in our Galaxy is significantly clumpy and inhomogeneous, and therefore substantially different from the smoother distribution of GeV cosmic rays. Our findings have important implications for the calculation and future interpretation of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes at very high energies.

2023-05-17, **Physics implication from higher weak isospin decomposition**, Phung Van Dong et.al., [2305.10150v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10150v1)

 The $SU(3)\_L\otimes U(1)\_X$ symmetry actually studied is directly broken to the electroweak symmetry $SU(2)\_L\otimes U(1)\_Y$ by a Higgs triplet, predicting a relevant new physics at TeV scale. This work argues, by contrast, that the higher weak isospin $SU(3)\_L$ might be broken at a high energy scale, much beyond $1$ TeV, by a Higgs octet to an intermediate symmetry $SU(2)\_L\otimes U(1)\_{T\_8}$ at TeV, before the latter $U(1)\_{T\_8}$ recombined with $U(1)\_X$ defines (i.e., broken to) $U(1)\_Y$ by a Higgs singlet. The new physics coupled to $SU(3)\_L$ breaking phase is decoupled, whereas what remains is a novel family-nonuniversal abelian model, $U(1)\_{T\_8}\otimes U(1)\_X$, significantly overhauling the standard model as well as yielding consistent results for neutrino mass, dark matter, $W$-mass anomaly, and FCNC, differently from the usual 3-3-1 model.

2023-05-17, **Study of collision and $γ$-cascade times following neutron-capture processes in cryogenic detectors**, CRAB collaboration et.al., [2305.10139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10139v1)

 The emission of $\gamma$-rays after a neutron capture in a cryogenic detector can generate mono-energetic nuclear recoils in the sub-keV regime, of direct interest for the calibration of Dark Matter and Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering experiments. Here we show that accurate predictions of the nuclear recoil spectra induced by neutron captures require taking into account the interplay between the development in time of the de-excitation $\gamma$-cascade of the target nucleus and that of the associated atomic collisions in matter. We present detailed simulations coupling the FIFRELIN code for the description of the $\gamma$-cascades and the IRADINA code for the modelling of the fast atomic movements in matter. Nuclear recoil spectra are predicted, and made available to the community, for concrete cases of Al$\_2$O$\_3$, Si, Ge and CaWO$\_4$ crystals exposed to a low intensity beam of thermal neutrons. We find that timing effects cause new calibration peaks to emerge in the recoil spectra and also impact the shape of the continuous recoil distribution. We discuss how they could give access to a rich physics program, spanning the accurate study of the response of cryogenic detectors in the sub-keV range, tests of solid state physics simulations and tests of nuclear models.

2023-05-17, **Updated T2K measurements of muon neutrino and antineutrino disappearance using 3.6 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ protons on target**, M. A. Ramírez et.al., [2305.09916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09916v1)

 Muon neutrino and antineutrino disappearance probabilities are identical in the standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework, but CPT violation and non-standard interactions can violate this symmetry. In this work we report the measurements of $\sin^{2} \theta\_{23}$ and $\Delta m\_{32}^2$ independently for neutrinos and antineutrinos. The aforementioned symmetry violation would manifest as an inconsistency in the neutrino and antineutrino oscillation parameters. The analysis discussed here uses a total of 1.97$\times$10$^{21}$ and 1.63$\times$10$^{21}$ protons on target taken with a neutrino and antineutrino beam respectively, and benefits from improved flux and cross-section models, new near detector samples and more than double the data reducing the overall uncertainty of the result. No significant deviation is observed, consistent with the standard neutrino oscillation picture.

2023-05-18, **Cosmology with a supersymmetric local $B-L$ model**, Kwang Sik Jeong et.al., [2305.11143v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11143v1)

 We propose a minimal gauged $U(1)\_{B-L}$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) which resolves the cosmological moduli problem via thermal inflation, and realizes late-time Affleck-Dine leptogensis so as to generate the right amount of baryon asymmetry at the end of thermal inflation. The present relic density of dark matter can be explained by sneutrinos, MSSM neutralinos, axinos, or axions. Cosmic strings from $U(1)\_{B-L}$ breaking are very thick, and so the expected stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic string loops has a spectrum different from the one in the conventional Abelian-Higgs model, as would be distinguishable at least at LISA and DECIGO. The characteristic spectrum is due to a flat potential, and may be regarded as a hint of supersymmetry. Combined with the resolution of moduli problem, the expected signal of gravitational waves constrains the $U(1)\_{B-L}$ breaking scale to be $\mathcal{O}(10^{12-13})\,{\rm GeV}$. Interestingly, our model provides a natural possibility for explaining the observed ultra-high-energy cosmic rays thanks to the fact that the core width of strings in our scenario is very large, allowing a large enhancement of particle emissions from the cusps of string loops. Condensation of $LH\_u$ flat-direction inside of string cores arises inevitably and can also be the main source of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays accompanied by ultra-high-energy lightest supersymmetric particles.

2023-05-18, **Equilibrium dynamical models for the Large Magellanic Cloud**, Nikolay Kacharov et.al., [2305.10980v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10980v1)

 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has a complex dynamics driven by both internal and external processes. The external forces are due to tidal interactions with the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way, while internally its dynamics mainly depends on the stellar, gas, and dark matter mass distributions. Despite the overall complexity of the system, very often simple physical models can give us important insights about the main driving factors. Here we focus on the internal forces and attempt to model the proper motions of $\sim10^6$ stars in the LMC as measured by Gaia Data Release 3 with an axisymmetric dynamical model, based on the Jeans equations. We test both cored and cusped spherical Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halos to fit the LMC gravitational potential. We find that this simple model is very successful at selecting a clean sample of genuine LMC member stars and predicts the geometry and orientation of the LMC with respect to the observer within the constraint of axisymmetry. Our Jeans dynamical models describe well the rotation profile and the velocity dispersion of the LMC stellar disc, however they fail to describe the motions of the LMC bar, which is a non-axisymmetric feature dominating the central region. We plan a triaxial Schwarzschild approach as a next step for the dynamical modelling of the LMC.

2023-05-18, **Dark matter condensates as highly nonlocal solitons: instability in the Schwarzschild metric and laboratory analog**, Ludovica Dieli et.al., [2305.10780v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10780v1)

 Theories on the bosonic nature of dark matter are a promising alternative to the cold dark matter model. Here we consider a dark matter halo in the state of a Bose-Einstein condensate, subject to the gravitation of a black hole. In the low energy limit, we bring together the general relativity in the Schwarzschild metric and the quantum description of the Bose-Einstein condensate. The model is solvable in the Fermi normal coordinates with the so called highly nonlocal approximation and describes tidal deformations in the condensate wave function. The black hole deforms the localized condensate until the attraction of the compact object overcomes the self-gravitation and destabilizes the solitonic dark matter. Moreover, the model can be implemented as a gravitational analog in the laboratory; the time-dependent potential generated by the galactic black hole can be mimicked by an optical trap acting on a conventional condensate. The results open the way to new laboratory simulators for quantum gravitational effects.

2023-05-17, **Relativistic drag forces on black holes from scalar dark matter clouds of all sizes**, Dina Traykova et.al., [2305.10492v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10492v1)

 We use numerical simulations of scalar field dark matter evolving on a moving black hole background to confirm the regime of validity of (semi-)analytic expressions derived from first principles for both dynamical friction and momentum accretion in the relativistic regime. We cover both small and large clouds (relative to the de Broglie wavelength of the scalars), and light and heavy particle masses (relative to the BH size). In the case of a small dark matter cloud, the effect of accretion is a non-negligible contribution to the total force on the black hole, even for small scalar masses. We confirm that this momentum accretion transitions between two regimes (wave- and particle-like) and we identify the mass of the scalar at which the transition between regimes occurs.

2023-05-17, **Field-level Lyman-alpha forest modelling in redshift space via augmented non-local Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation**, Francesco Sinigaglia et.al., [2305.10428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10428v1)

 We present an improved analytical model to predict the Lyman-alpha forest at the field level in redshift space from the dark matter field, expanding upon the widely-used Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation (FGPA). In particular, we introduce the dependence on the cosmic web environment (knots, filaments, sheets, voids) in the model, thereby effectively accounting for non-local bias. Furthermore, we include a detailed treatment of velocity bias in the redshift space distortions modelling, allowing the velocity bias to be cosmic-web dependent. We find evidence for a significant difference of the same model parameters in different environments, suggesting that for the investigated setup the simple standard FGPA is not able to adequately predict the Lyman-alpha forest in the different cosmic web regimes. We reproduce the summary statistics of the reference cosmological hydrodynamic simulation we use for comparison, yielding accurate mean transmitted flux, probability distribution function, 3D power spectrum, and bispectrum. In particular, we achieve maximum deviation and average deviations accuracy in the Lyman-alpha forest 3D power spectrum of $\sim 3\%$ and $\sim 0.1\%$ up to $k\sim 0.4 \, h \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, $\sim 5\%$ and $\sim 1.8\%$ up to $k \sim 1.4 \, h \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our new model outperforms previous analytical efforts to predict the Lyman-alpha forest at the field level in all the probed summary statistics, and has the potential to become instrumental in the generation of fast accurate mocks for covariance matrices estimation in the context of current and forthcoming Lyman-alpha forest surveys.

2023-05-17, **Aspherical ULDM Collapse: Variation in the Core-Halo Mass Relation**, Emily Kendall et.al., [2305.10340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10340v1)

 Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is an interesting alternative to the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. Due to the extremely low mass of the constituent particle ($\sim 10^{-22}$ eV), ULDM can exhibit quantum effects up to kiloparsec scales. In particular, runaway collapse in the centres of ULDM halos is prevented by quantum pressure, providing a possible resolution to the 'core-cusp problem' of CDM. However, the the detailed relationship between the ULDM core mass and that of the overall halo is poorly understood. We simulate the collapse of both spherical and aspherical isolated ULDM overdensities using AxioNyx, finding that the central cores of collapsed halos undergo sustained oscillatory behaviour which affects both their peak density and overall morphology. The variability in core morphology increases with the asphericity of the initial overdensity and remnants of initial asphericity persist long after collapse. Furthermore, the peak central densities are higher in spherical configurations. Consequently, astrophysically realistic halos may exhibit substantial departures from theoretical core-halo profiles and we would expect a significant variance of the properties of halos with the same mass.

2023-05-17, **WIMP decay as a possible Warm Dark Matter model**, Abineet Parichha et.al., [2305.10315v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10315v1)

 The Weakly Interacting Massive Particles(WIMPs) have long been the favored CDM candidate in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. However, owing to great improvement in the experimental sensitivity in the past decade, some parameter space of the SUSY-based WIMP model is ruled out. In addition, WIMP as the CDM particle is also at variance with other astrophysical observables at small scales. We consider a model that addresses both these issues. In the model, the WIMP decays into a massive particle and radiation. We study the background evolution and the first order perturbation theory (coupled Einstein-Boltzmann equations) for this model and show that the dynamics can be captured by a single parameter $r=m\_L/q$, which is the ratio of the lighter mass and the comoving momentum of the decay particle. We incorporate the relevant equations in the existing Boltzmann code CLASS to compute the matter power spectra and CMB angular power spectra. The decaying WIMP model is akin to a non-thermal Warm Dark Matter(WDM) model and suppresses matter power at small scales, which could alleviate several issues that plague the CDM model. We compare the predictions of the model with CMB, galaxy clustering, and high-z HI data. Both these data sets yield $r\gtrsim 10^6$, which can be translated into the bounds on other parameters. In particular, we obtain the following lower bounds on the self-annihilation cross-section of WIMPs $\sigma$, and the lighter mass $m\_L$: $\sigma\gtrsim 5\times 10^{-44}\,\rm cm^2$ and $m\_L\gtrsim 2.4\,\rm keV$. The lower limit on $m\_L$ is comparable to constraints on the mass of thermally-produced WDM particle. The limit on the self-annihilation cross-section greatly expands the available parameter space as compared to the stable WIMP scenario.

2023-05-17, **Exploring dark matter models with global fits**, Tomás E. Gonzalo et.al., [2305.10287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10287v1)

 In this conference paper I present the results from a few global studies of Dark Matter (DM) models, in light of recent constraints from direct detection, indirect detection and collider experiments. I show the most recent analysis of models of singlet Higgs-portal DM, where the DM particle is a scalar, vector, Majorana or Dirac fermion. I also present the results from a global study of an effective field theory of DM, where we find that the model shows a strong preference for a low scale of new physics. For all models I show the prospects for detection or exclusions with future experiments.

2023-05-17, **Bounding the mass of ultralight bosonic Dark Matter particles with the motion of the S2 star around Sgr A***, Riccardo Della Monica et.al., [2305.10242v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10242v1)

 Dark matter is undoubtedly one of the fundamental, albeit unknown, components of the standard cosmological model. The failure to detect WIMPs, the most promising candidate particle for cold dark matter, actually opens the way for the exploration of viable alternatives, of which ultralight bosonic particles with masses $\sim 10^{-21}$ eV represent one of the most encouraging. N-body simulations have shown that such particles form solitonic cores in the innermost parts of virialized galactic halos that are supported by internal quantum pressure on characteristic $\sim$kpc de Broglie scales. In the Galaxy, this halo region can be probed by means of S-stars orbiting the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* to unveil the presence of such a solitonic core and, ultimately, to bound the boson mass $m\_\psi$. Employing a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm, we compare the predicted orbital motion of S2 with publicly available data and set an upper bound $m\_\psi \lesssim 3.2\times 10^{-19}$ eV on the boson mass, at 95% confidence level. When combined with other galactic and cosmological probes, our constraints help to reduce the allowed range of the bosonic mass to $(2.0 \lesssim m\_\psi \lesssim 32.2)\times 10^{-20}$ eV, at the 95% confidence level, which opens the way to precision measurements of the mass of the ultralight bosonic dark matter.

 In this paper we extend the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) to include HI emission. The HI T-RECS model is based on the most recent HI mass function estimates, combined with prescriptions to convert HI mass to total integrated HI flux. It further models source size, morphology and kinematics, including rotational velocity and HI line width. The continuum T-RECS model is updated to improve the agreement with deeper number counts available at 150\,MHz. The model for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is also modified according to the most recent indications of a star formation rate (SFR)--radio luminosity relation, which depends primarily on stellar mass rather than redshift. We further introduce prescriptions to associate an HI mass to the T-RECS radio continuum SFG and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) populations. This gives us a way to meaningfully associate counterparts between HI and continuum catalogues, thus building HI $\times$ continuum simulated observations. Clustering properties of the sources in both HI and continuum are reproduced by associating the galaxies to dark matter haloes of a cosmological simulation. We deliver a set of mock catalogues, as well as the code to produce them, which can be used for simulating observations and predicting results from radio surveys with existing and forthcoming radio facilities, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)

 The Galactic Halo is a key target for indirect dark matter detection. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory is a high-energy (~300 GeV to >100 TeV) gamma-ray detector located in central Mexico. HAWC operates via the water Cherenkov technique and has both a wide field of view of 2 sr and a >95% duty cycle, making it ideal for analyses of highly extended sources. We made use of these properties of HAWC and a new background-estimation technique optimized for extended sources to probe a large region of the Galactic Halo for dark matter signals. With this approach, we set improved constraints on dark matter annihilation and decay between masses of 10 and 100 TeV. Due to the large spatial extent of the HAWC field of view, these constraints are robust against uncertainties in the Galactic dark matter spatial profile.

2023-05-18, **Multiple Peaks and a Long Precursor in the Type IIn Supernova 2021qqp: An Energetic Explosion in a Complex Circumsteller Environment**, Daichi Hiramatsu et.al., [2305.11168v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11168v1)

 We present detailed optical photometry and spectroscopy of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2021qqp. Its unusual light curve is marked by a long gradual brightening (i.e., precursor) for about 300 days, a rapid increase in brightness for about 60 days, and then a sharp increase of about 1.6 mag in only a few days to a first peak of $M\_r\approx -19.5$ mag. The light curve then turns over and declines rapidly, until it re-brightens to a second distinct and sharp peak with $M\_r\approx -17.3$ mag centered at about 335 days after the first peak. The spectra are dominated by Balmer-series lines with a complex morphology that includes a narrow component with a width of $\approx 1300$ km s$^{-1}$ (first peak) and $\approx 2500$ km s$^{-1}$ (second peak) that we associate with the circumstellar medium (CSM), and a P Cygni component with an absorption velocity of $\approx 8500$ km s$^{-1}$ (first peak) and $\approx 5600$ km s$^{-1}$ (second peak) that we associate with the SN-CSM interaction shell. Using the bolometric light curve and velocity evolution, we construct an analytical model to extract the CSM profile and SN properties. We find two significant mass-loss episodes with peak mass loss rates of $\approx 10$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\approx 5$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ about 0.8 and 2 years before explosion, and a total CSM mass of $\approx 2-4\,M\_\odot$. We show that the most recent mass-loss episode can explain the precursor for the year preceding the explosion. The SN ejecta mass is constrained to be $M\_{\rm SN}\approx 5-30\,M\_\odot$ for an explosion energy of $E\_{\rm SN}\approx (3-10)\times10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$. We discuss eruptive massive stars (luminous blue variable, pulsational pair instability) and an extreme stellar merger with a compact object as possible progenitor channels for generating the energetic explosion in the complex CSM environment.

2023-05-17, **White dwarf cooling in $f(R,T)$ gravity**, Snehasish Bhattacharjee et.al., [2305.10144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10144v1)

 In recent times, astounding observations of both over- and under-luminous type Ia supernovae have emerged. These peculiar observations hint not only at surpassing the Chandrasekhar limit but may also suggest potential modifications in the physical attributes of their progenitors, such as their cooling rate. This, in turn, can influence their temporal assessments and provide a compelling explanation for these intriguing observations. In this spirit, we investigate here the cooling process of white dwarfs in $f(R,T)$ gravity with the simplest model $f(R,T) = R + \lambda T$, where $\lambda$ is the model parameter. Our modelling suggests that the cooling timescale of white dwarfs exhibits an inverse relationship with the model parameter $\lambda$, which implies that for identical initial conditions, white dwarfs in $f(R,T)$ gravity cool faster. This further unveils that in the realm of $f(R,T)$ gravity, the energy release rate for white dwarfs increases as $\lambda$ increases. Furthermore, we also report that the luminosity of the white dwarfs also depends on $\lambda$ and an upswing in $\lambda$ leads to an amplification in the luminosity, and consequently a larger white dwarf in general relativity can exhibit comparable luminosity to a smaller white dwarf in $f(R,T)$ gravity.

2023-05-17, **Reducing the uncertainty on the Hubble constant up to 35\% with an improved statistical analysis: different best-fit likelihoods for Supernovae Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Quasars, and Gamma-Ray Bursts**, Maria Giovanna Dainotti et.al., [2305.10030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10030v1)

 Cosmological models and their parameters are widely debated, especially about whether the current discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant, $H\_{0}$, obtained by type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and the Planck data from the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation could be alleviated when alternative cosmological models are considered. Thus, combining high-redshift probes, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and Quasars (QSOs), together with Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and SNe Ia is important to assess the viability of these alternative models and if they can cast further light on the Hubble tension. In this work, for GRBs, we use a 3-dimensional relation between the peak prompt luminosity, the rest-frame time at the end of the X-ray plateau, and its corresponding luminosity in X-rays: the 3D Dainotti fundamental plane relation. Regarding QSOs, we use the Risaliti-Lusso relation among the UV and X-ray luminosities for a sample of 2421 sources. We correct both the QSO and GRB relations by accounting for selection and evolutionary effects with a reliable statistical method. We here use both the traditional Gaussian likelihoods ($\cal L\_G$) and the new best-fit likelihoods ($\cal L\_N$) to infer cosmological parameters of a non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and flat $w$CDM models. We obtain for all the parameters reduced uncertainties, up to $35\%$ for $H\_{0}$, when applying the new $\cal L\_N$ likelihoods in place of the Gaussian ones. Our results remain consistent with a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, although with a shift of the dark energy parameter $w$ toward $w<-1$ and a curvature density parameter toward $\Omega\_k<0$.
