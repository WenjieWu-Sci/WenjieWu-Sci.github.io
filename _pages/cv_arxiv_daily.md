2023-04-04, **Fast flavor evolution in dense neutrino systems, as described in quantum field theory**, R. F. Sawyer et.al., [2304.01987v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01987v1)

 Investigations of dense neutrino cloud evolution through quantum kinetic equations led to the possibility of ``fast flavor" (FF) processes. It is shown here that the usual quantum kinetic equations, while signaling the instabilities that make some instances of FF possible, are being erroneously interpreted. Approaching the subject directly from the quantum field theory that defines the standard model shows the computational structures in most of the recent FF literature to be completely invalid. Our revisions also underlie what could be a treasure trove of new early universe applications and a general result for relic supernova neutrinos that could be tested as a feature of the diffuse neutrino spectrum.

2023-04-04, **Cause of discrepancy problem of calculated running sums to nuclear matrix element of two-neutrino double-$β$ decay**, J. Terasaki et.al., [2304.01719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01719v1)

 A qualitative difference in the running sum to the nuclear matrix element of the two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay of $^{136}$Xe has been found four years ago between QRPA and shell model calculations. The former result has large increase and decrease with respect to the excitation energy of the intermediate state, and the latter one is an almost monotonically and mildly increasing function. My QRPA calculations independent of the above one do not have a remarkable decrease. This discrepancy is a serious problem affecting the reliability of calculations of the neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay, and the cause was unknown. I perform several relevant test calculations and consider analytically to find the cause, which is found to be in the strength of the attractive interactions. The possible major local decrease in the running sum is also explained analytically. The interactions of my QRPA calculation are appropriate in terms of the strength, thus, the almost monotonic behavior is reasonable.

2023-04-03, **Implications of NSI constraints from ANTARES and IceCube on a simplified $Z^\prime$ model**, J. M. Cabarcas et.al., [2304.01388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01388v1)

 Recently the neutrino experiments ANTARES and IceCube have released new constraints to the non-standard neutrino interaction (NSI) parameter $\epsilon^d\_{\mu\tau}$ (flavor off-diagonal). These new constraints are stronger than those obtained from a combination of COHERENT and neutrino oscillation data. In the light of the recent constraints from ANTARES and IceCube data on the NSI parameter $\epsilon^d\_{\mu\tau}$, in this work, we study the new physics implications on the parameter space of a simplified $Z^\prime$ model with lepton flavor violating ($\mu\tau$) couplings. For a $Z^\prime$ boson with a mass heavier than the $\tau$ lepton, our results show that ANTARES and IceCube put strong constraints to such a new physics scenario with $\mu\tau$ couplings. In addition, these neutrino experiments can exclude a similar region than ATLAS experiment, showing the potential to provide complementary information to the one obtained from direct searches at the Large Hadron Collider. The impact of the expected sensitivity reach on $\epsilon^d\_{\mu\tau}$ at DUNE experiment is also studied.

2023-04-03, **IceCat-1: the IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2304.01174v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01174v1)

 We present a catalog of likely astrophysical neutrino track-like events from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. IceCube began reporting likely astrophysical neutrinos in 2016 and this system was updated in 2019. IceCube began reporting likely astrophysical neutrinos in 2016 and this system was updated in 2019. The catalog presented here includes events that were reported in real-time since 2019, as well as events identified in archival data samples starting from 2011. We report 275 neutrino events from two selection channels as the first entries in the catalog, the IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks, which will see ongoing extensions with additional alerts. The gold and bronze alert channels respectively provide neutrino candidates with 50\% and 30\% probability of being astrophysical, on average assuming an astrophysical neutrino power law energy spectral index of 2.19. For each neutrino alert, we provide the reconstructed energy, direction, false alarm rate, probability of being astrophysical in origin, and likelihood contours describing the spatial uncertainty in the alert's reconstructed location. We also investigate a directional correlation of these neutrino events with gamma-ray and X-ray catalogs including 4FGL, 3HWC, TeVCat and Swift-BAT.

2023-04-03, **Invariant mass reconstruction of heavy gauge bosons decaying to $τ$ leptons using machine learning techniques**, Vinaya Krishnan MB et.al., [2304.01126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01126v1)

 Many analyses are performed by the LHC experiments to search for heavy gauge bosons, which appear in several new physics models. The invariant mass reconstruction of heavy gauge bosons is difficult when they decay to $\tau$ leptons due to missing neutrinos in the final state. Machine learning techniques are widely utilized in experimental high-energy physics, in particular in analyzing the large amount of data produced at the LHC. In this paper, we study machine learning techniques such as supervised and unsupervised neural network algorithms to reconstruct the invariant mass of $Z^{\prime}~\rightarrow~\tau\tau$ and $W^{\prime}~\rightarrow~\tau\nu$ decays, which can improve the sensitivity of these searches.

2023-04-03, **Investigating starburst-driven neutrino emission from galaxies in the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey**, Yarno Merckx et.al., [2304.01020v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01020v1)

 We present a phenomenological framework for starburst-driven neutrino production via proton-proton collisions and apply it to (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). The framework relates the infrared luminosity of a GOALS galaxy, derived from consistently available Herschel Space Observatory data, to the expected starburst-driven neutrino flux. The model parameters that define this relation can be estimated from multi-wavelength data. We apply the framework in a case study to the LIRG NGC 3690 (Arp 299, Mrk 171) and compare the obtained neutrino fluxes to the current sensitivity of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Using our framework, we also conclude that the neutrino emission in the LIRG NGC 1068, recently presented as the first steady IceCube neutrino point source, cannot be explained by a starburst-driven scenario and is therefore likely dominated by the active galactic nucleus in this galaxy. In addition to the single-source investigations, we also estimate the diffuse starburst-driven neutrino flux from GOALS galaxies and the total LIRG population over cosmic history.

2023-04-03, **Sterile neutrino searches with reactor antineutrinos using coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments**, S. P. Behera et.al., [2304.00912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00912v1)

 We present an analysis on the sensitivity to the active-sterile neutrino mixing with Germanium (Ge) and Silicon (Si) detectors in the context of proposed coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus experiment in India. The study has been carried out with 3 (active) + 1 (sterile) neutrino oscillation model. It is observed that the measurements that can be carried out with Ge detector give better sensitivity for the active-sterile neutrino mixing as compared to Si detector. Both the detectors are able to exclude most of the anomaly regions observed by the GALLIUM experiment. The Ge detector with mass 10 kg can observe the active sterile neutrino oscillation at 95$\%$ confidence level provided \sin^{2}2\theta\_{14}\geq 0.09 at \Delta m^{2}\_{41} = 1.0 eV^{2} for an exposure of 1-yr. At higher values of \Delta m^{2}\_{41} the better sensitivity is obtained at short baseline. It is also found that the threshold as well as resolution of detectors play a crucial role for measuring the active-sterile neutrino mixing parameters.

2023-04-03, **Constraints on the localization volume of High Energy Neutrinos for galaxy-targetted electromagnetic followups**, Thierry Pradier et.al., [2304.00831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00831v1)

 High Energy Neutrino telescopes such as IceCube or KM3NeT issue public alerts describing the characteristics of possible astrophysical high energy neutrino events. This information, in particular the arrival direction and the associated uncertainty of the neutrino candidates, is used by observatories to search for possible electromagnetic counterparts. Such searches are complicated by the localization areas as high as tens of squared degrees or more and the absence of constraints on the distance or nature of the source, contrarily to gravitational wave alerts issued by instruments such as LIGO/Virgo. A method to derive a probable distance for the astrophysical source possibly associated to a HEN event is described, which can be used in a cross-match with galaxy catalogues to search for possible electromagnetic counterparts. This is intended as a guide for high energy neutrino followup campaigns.

2023-04-04, **Kinetic relaxation and Bose-star formation in multicomponent dark matter- I**, Mudit Jain et.al., [2304.01985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01985v1)

 Using wave kinetics, we estimate the emergence time-scale of gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates/Bose stars in the kinetic regime for a general multicomponent Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson (SP) system. We identify some effects of the diffusion and friction pieces in the wave-kinetic Boltzmann equation (at leading order in perturbation theory) and provide estimates for the kinetic nucleation rate of condensates. We test our analysis using full $3+1$ dimensional simulations of multicomponent SP system. With an eye towards applications to multicomponent dark matter, we investigate two general cases in detail. First is a massive spin-$s$ field with $N=2s+1$ components (scalar $s=0$, vector $s=1$ and tensor $s=2$). We find that for a democratic population of different components, the condensation time-scale is $\tau\_{(s)}\approx \tau\_0\times N$, where $\tau\_0$ is the condensation time scale for the scalar case. Second is the case of two scalars with different boson masses. In this case, we map-out how the condensation time depends on the ratios of their average mass densities and boson masses, revealing competition and assistance between components, and a guide towards which component condenses first. For instance, with $m\_1 < m\_2$ and not too disparate mass densities, we verify that the time scale of condensation of the first species quickly becomes independent of $m\_2/m\_1$, whereas for equal average number densities, the emergence time scale decreases with increasing $m\_2/m\_1$.

2023-04-04, **Gravitational Bose-Einstein Condensation of Vector/Hidden Photon Dark Matter**, Jiajun Chen et.al., [2304.01965v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01965v1)

 We study the gravitational Bose-Einstein condensation of a massive vector field in the kinetic regime and the non-relativistic limit using non-linear dynamical numerical methods. Gravitational condensation leads to the spontaneous formation of solitons. We measure the condensation time and growth rate, and compare to analytical models in analogy to the scalar case. We find that the condensation time of the vector field depends on the correlation between its different components. For fully correlated configurations, the condensation time is the same as that for a scalar field. On the other hand, uncorrelated or partially correlated configurations condense slower than the scalar case. As the vector soliton grows, it acquires a net spin angular momentum even if the total spin angular momentum of the initial conditions is zero.

2023-04-04, **Growth of Perturbations in Energy-Momentum-Squared Gravity**, Bita Farsi et.al., [2304.01571v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01571v1)

 Employing the spherical collapse (SC) formalism, we investigate the linear evolution of the matter overdensity for energy-momentum-squared gravity (EMSG) which in practical phenomenological terms, one may imagine as an extension of \LambdaCDM model of cosmology. The underlying model while still having a cosmological constant, is a nonlinear matter extension of the general theory of relativity and includes modification terms dominating in the high energy regimes i.e., early universe. Considering the Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background in the presence of a cosmological constant, we find the effects of the modifications arising from EMSG on the growth of perturbations at the early stages of the universe. By taking into account both possible negative, and positive values of the model parameter of EMSG, we discuss its role in the evolution of the matter density contrast and growth function in the level of linear perturbations. While EMSG leaves imprints distinguishable from \LambdaCDM, we find that the negative range of the ESMG model parameter is not well-behaved indicating an anomaly in the parameter space of the model. In this regard, for the evaluation of the galaxy cluster number count in the framework of EMSG, we equivalently provide an analysis of the number count of the gravitationally collapsed objects (or the dark matter halos). We show that the galaxy cluster number count decreases compared to the \LambdaCDM model. In agreement with the hierarchical model of structure formation, in EMSG cosmology also the more massive structures are less abundant, meaning that form at later times.

2023-04-04, **Search for bosonic super-weakly interacting massive particles at COSINE-100**, G. Adhikari et.al., [2304.01460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01460v1)

 We present results of a search for bosonic super-weakly interacting massive particles (BSW) as keV scale dark matter candidates that is based on an exposure of 97.7 kg$\cdot$year from the COSINE experiment. In this search, we employ, for the first time, Compton-like as well as absorption processes for pseudoscalar and vector BSWs. No evidence for BSWs is found in the mass range from 10 $\mathrm{keV/c}^2$ to 1 $\mathrm{MeV/c}^2$, and we present the exclusion limits on the dimensionless coupling constants to electrons $g\_{ae}$ for pseudoscalar and $\kappa$ for vector BSWs at 90% confidence level. Our results show that these limits are improved by including the Compton-like process in masses of BSW, above $\mathcal{O}(100\,\mathrm{keV/c}^2)$.

2023-04-03, **Probing compact dark matter objects with microlensing in gravitationally lensed quasars**, Petra Awad et.al., [2304.01320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01320v1)

 The microlensing signal in the light curves of gravitationally lensed quasars can shed light on the dark matter (DM) composition in their lensing galaxies. Here, we investigate a sample of six lensed quasars from the most recent and best COSMOGRAIL observations: HE~1104$-$1805, HE~0435$-$1223, RX~J1131$-$1231, WFI~2033$-$4723, PG~1115$+$080, and J1206$+$4332, yielding a total of eight microlensing light curves, when combining independent image pairs and typically spanning ten years. We explore the microlensing signals to determine whether the standard assumptions on the stellar populations are sufficient to account for the amplitudes of the measured signals. We use the most detailed lens models to date from the H0LiCOW/TDCOSMO collaboration to generate simulated microlensing light curves. Finally, we propose a methodology based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to verify whether the observed microlensing amplitudes in our data are compatible with the most standard scenario, whereby galaxies are composed of stars as compact bodies and smoothly distributed DM. Given our current sample, we show that the standard scenario cannot be rejected, in contrast with previous results by Hawkins (2020a), claiming that a population of stellar mass primordial black holes (PBHs) is necessary to explain the amplitude of the microlensing signals in lensed quasar light curves. We further estimate the number of microlensing light curves needed to distinguish between the standard scenario with stellar microlensing and a scenario that describes all the DM contained in galaxies in the form of compact objects such as PBHs, with a mean mass of $0.2M\_{\odot}$. We find that about 900 microlensing curves from the Rubin Observatory will be sufficient to discriminate between the two extreme scenarios at a 95\% confidence level.

2023-04-03, **Black hole superradiant instability for massive spin-2 fields**, Oscar J. C. Dias et.al., [2304.01265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01265v1)

 Due to coherent superradiant amplification, massive bosonic fields can trigger an instability in spinning black holes, tapping their energy and angular momentum and forming macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensates around them. This phenomenon produces gaps in the mass-spin distribution of astrophysical black holes, a continuous gravitational-wave signal emitted by the condensate, and several environmental effects relevant for gravitational-wave astronomy and radio images of black holes. While the spectrum of superradiantly unstable mode is known in great detail for massive scalar (spin-0) and vector (spin-1) perturbations, so far only approximated results were derived for the case of massive tensor (spin-2) fields, due to the nonseparability of the field equations. Here, solving a system of ten elliptic partial differential equations, we close this program and compute the spectrum of the most unstable modes of a massive spin-2 field for generic black-hole spin and boson mass, beyond the hydrogenic approximation and including the unique dipole mode that dominates the instability in the spin-2 case. We find that the instability timescale for this mode is orders of magnitude shorter than for any other superradiant mode, yielding much stronger constraints on massive spin-2 fields. These results pave the way for phenomenological studies aimed at constraining beyond Standard Model scenarios, ultralight dark matter candidates, and extensions to General Relativity using gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations, and have implications for the phase diagram of vacuum solutions of higher-dimensional gravity.

2023-04-03, **On the primordial black hole formation in hybrid inflation**, Yuichiro Tada et.al., [2304.01249v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01249v1)

 We revisit the scenario of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in hybrid inflation models. In a minimal setup considered in the literature, the mass and abundance of PBHs are correlated and astrophysical size PBHs tend to be overproduced. This is because a longer length scale for curvature perturbations (or a larger PBH mass) requires a longer waterfall regime with a flatter potential, which results in overproduction of curvature perturbations. However, in this paper, we discuss that the higher-dimensional terms for the inflaton potential affect the dynamics during the waterfall phase transition and show that astrophysical size PHBs of order $10^{17\text{--}23} \, {\rm g}$ (which can explain the whole dark matter) can form in some parameter space consistently with any existing constraints. The scenario can be tested by observing the induced gravitational waves from scalar perturbations by future gravitational wave experiments, such as LISA.

2023-04-03, **Supermassive Dark Star candidates seen by JWST?**, Cosmin Ilie et.al., [2304.01173v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01173v1)

 The first generation of stars in the Universe is yet to be observed. There are two leading theories for those objects that mark the beginning of the cosmic dawn: hydrogen burning Population~III stars and Dark Stars, made of hydrogen and helium but powered by Dark Matter heating. The latter can grow to become supermassive ($M\_\star\sim 10^6\Msun$) and extremely bright ($L\sim 10^9L\_\odot$). We show that each of the following three objects: JADES-GS-z13-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z11-0 (at redshifts $z\in[11,14]$) are consistent with a Supermassive Dark Star interpretation, thus identifying, for the first time, Dark Star candidates.

2023-04-03, **Investigating the GmSUGRA in the MSSM through the long-lived bino NLSP at the HL-LHC**, Wenxing Zhang et.al., [2304.01082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01082v1)

 The axino, the supersymmetric partner of axion, is a well-motivated warm/hot dark matter candidate, and provides a natural solution to the relic density problem for the bino-like neutralino if it is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). With the Generalized Minimal Supergravity, we study such kind of the viable parameter space where the bino-like neutralino is the next-to-LSP (NLSP) and the axino is the LSP. In addition, we consider a scenario where the bino is a long-lived NLSP with the lifetime varying from $10^{-6}$s to $10^{-4}$s, and then propose a new signal searching scheme involving one displaced photon together with the large missing transverse momentum at the HL-LHC. The bino-like lightest neutralino lies under or around 100 GeV and is produced as a decay product of the right-handed sleptons.The relevant axion coupling $f\_a$ can be probed up to $\mathcal{O}(10^9)$ GeV at 2$\sigma$ level for the right-handed slepton mass under 300 GeV and the lightest neutralino mass under 100 GeV.

2023-04-03, **$Sp(2N)$ Lattice Gauge Theories and Extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics**, Ed Bennett et.al., [2304.01070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01070v1)

 We review the current status of the long-term programme of numerical investigation of $Sp(2N)$ gauge theories with and without fermionic matter content. We start by introducing the phenomenological as well as theoretical motivations for this research programme, which are related to composite Higgs models, models of partial top compositeness, dark matter models, and in general to the physics of strongly coupled theories and their approach to the large-N limit. We summarise the results of lattice studies conducted so far in the $Sp(2N)$ Yang-Mills theories, measuring the string tension, the mass spectrum of glueballs and the topological susceptibility, and discuss their large-N extrapolation. We then focus our discussion on $Sp(4)$, and summarise numerical measurements of mass and decay constant of mesons in the theories with fermion matter in either the fundamental or the antisymmetric representation, first in the quenched approximation, and then with dynamical fermions. We finally discuss the case of dynamical fermions in mixed representations, and exotic composite fermion states such as the chimera baryons. We conclude by sketching the future stages of the programme. And we describe our approach to open access.

2023-04-03, **Solar radio emissions and ultralight dark matter**, Haipeng An et.al., [2304.01056v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01056v1)

 Ultralight axions and dark photons are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Inside the plasma, once the mass of ultralight dark matter candidates equals the plasma frequency, they can resonantly convert into electromagnetic waves, due to the coupling between the ultralight dark matter particles and the standard model photons. The converted electromagnetic waves are monochromatic. In this article, we review the development of using radio detectors to search for ultralight dark matter conversions in the solar corona and solar wind plasma.

2023-04-03, **Freeze-in of WIMP dark matter**, Xiaorui Wong et.al., [2304.00908v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00908v1)

 We propose a novel scenario for dark matter (DM) in which weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can freeze-in due to a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the early Universe. The FOPT dilutes the preexisting DM density to zero, and leads to a sudden change in DM mass that prevents WIMPs from re-equilibrating due to their large mass-to-temperature ratio. Following the FOPT, WIMPs are produced via a freeze-in process, even though their interactions are NOT feeble. We demonstrate this concept using a simplified model and then realize the scenario in a realistic model with a delayed electroweak phase transition. Our work extends the category of WIMP DM and opens up a new direction for the freeze-in mechanism.

2023-04-03, **Reanalysis of the Systematic Uncertainties in Cosmic-Ray Antiproton Flux**, Xing-Jian Lv et.al., [2304.00760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00760v1)

 Recent studies on cosmic rays (CRs) have reported the possibility of an excess in the antiproton flux around $10-20$ GeV. However, the associated systematic uncertainties have impeded the interpretation of these findings. In this study, we conduct a global Bayesian analysis to constrain the propagation parameters and evaluate the CR antiproton spectrum, while comprehensively accounting for uncertainties associated with interstellar CR propagation, production cross sections for antiprotons and other secondaries, and the charge and energy dependent effects of solar modulation. We establish that the most recent AMS-02 $\bar{p}$ spectrum is in agreement with a pure secondary origin. Based on this, we establish upper limits on dark matter (DM) annihilation. We also determine that the AMS-02 data favors the empirical hadronic interaction models over phenomenological ones. Finally, we find that the latest AMS-02 antiproton data from 2011 to 2018 disfavors the antiproton excess at $\mathcal{O}$(10) GeV and the corresponding DM interpretation that can simultaneously account for the Galactic Center excess in the gamma-ray observation.

2023-04-03, **Modelling Dark Matter Halo Spin using Observations and Simulations: application to UGC 5288**, Sioree Ansar et.al., [2304.00724v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00724v1)

 Dark matter (DM) halo properties are extensively studied in cosmological simulations but are very challenging to estimate from observations. The DM halo density profile of observed galaxies is modelled using multiple probes that trace the dark matter potential. However, the angular momentum distribution of DM halos is still a subject of debate. In this study we investigate a method for estimating the halo spin and halo concentration of low surface brightness (LSB), gas-rich dwarf barred galaxy UGC 5288, by forward modelling disk properties derived from observations - stellar and gas surface densities, disk scale length, HI rotation curve, bar length and bar ellipticity. We combine semi-analytical techniques, N-body/SPH and cosmological simulations to model the DM halo of UGC 5288 with both a cuspy Hernquist profile and a flat-core pseudo-isothermal profile. We find that the best match with observations is a pseudo-isothermal halo model with a core radius of $r\_{c} = 0.23$ kpc, and halo spin of $\lambda$= 0.08 at the virial radius. Although our findings are consistent with previous core radius estimates of the halo density profile of UGC 5288, as well as with the halo spin profiles of similar mass analogues of UGC5288 in the high-resolution cosmological-magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, there still remain some uncertainties as we are limited in our knowledge of the formation history of the galaxy. Additionally, we find that the inner halo spin ($ r< 10$ kpc) in barred galaxies is different from the unbarred ones, and the halo spin shows weak correlations with bar properties.

2023-04-03, **Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 Results: Cosmology from Cosmic Shear Two-point Correlation Functions**, Xiangchong Li et.al., [2304.00702v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00702v2)

 We perform a blinded cosmology analysis with cosmic shear two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) measured from more than 25 million galaxies in the Hyper Suprime-Cam three-year shear catalog in four tomographic redshift bins ranging from 0.3 to 1.5. After conservative masking and galaxy selection, the survey covers 416 deg$^2$ of the northern sky with an effective galaxy number density of 15 arcmin$^{-2}$ over the four redshift bins. The 2PCFs adopted for cosmology analysis are measured in the angular range: $7.1 < \theta/{\rm arcmin} < 56.6$ for $\xi\_+$ and $31.2 <\theta/{\rm arcmin} < 248$ for $\xi\_-$, with a total signal-to-noise ratio of 26.6. We apply a conservative, wide, flat prior on the photometric redshift errors on the last two tomographic bins, and the relative magnitudes of the cosmic shear amplitude across four redshift bins allow us to calibrate the photometric redshift errors. With this flat prior on redshift errors, we find $\Omega\_{\rm m}=0.256\_{-0.044}^{+0.056}$ and $S\_8\equiv \sigma\_8 \sqrt{\Omega\_{\rm m}/0.3}=0.769\_{-0.034}^{+0.031}$ (both 68\% CI) for a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology. We find, after unblinding, that our constraint on $S\_8$ is consistent with the Fourier space cosmic shear and the 3$\times$2pt analyses on the same HSC dataset. We carefully study the potential systematics from astrophysical and systematic model uncertainties in our fiducial analysis using synthetic data, and report no biases (including projection bias in the posterior space) greater than $0.5\sigma$ in the estimation of $S\_8$. Our analysis hints that the mean redshifts of the two highest tomographic bins are higher than initially estimated. In addition, a number of consistency tests are conducted to assess the robustness of our analysis. Comparing our result with Planck-2018 cosmic microwave background observations, we find a ~$2\sigma$ tension for the $\Lambda$CDM model.

2023-04-04, **The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: Corrections on photometry due to wavelength-dependent atmospheric effects**, J. Lee et.al., [2304.01858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01858v1)

 Wavelength-dependent atmospheric effects impact photometric supernova flux measurements for ground-based observations. We present corrections on supernova flux measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program's 5YR sample (DES-SN5YR) for differential chromatic refraction (DCR) and wavelength-dependent seeing, and we show their impact on the cosmological parameters $w$ and $\Omega\_m$. We use $g-i$ colors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to quantify astrometric offsets caused by DCR and simulate point spread functions (PSFs) using the GalSIM package to predict the shapes of the PSFs with DCR and wavelength-dependent seeing. We calculate the magnitude corrections and apply them to the magnitudes computed by the DES-SN5YR photometric pipeline. We find that for the DES-SN5YR analysis, not accounting for the astrometric offsets and changes in the PSF shape cause an average bias of $+0.2$ mmag and $-0.3$ mmag respectively, with standard deviations of $0.7$ mmag and $2.7$ mmag across all DES observing bands (\textit{griz}) throughout all redshifts. When the DCR and seeing effects are not accounted for, we find that $w$ and $\Omega\_m$ are lower by less than $0.004\pm0.02$ and $0.001\pm0.01$ respectively, with $0.02$ and $0.01$ being the $1\sigma$ statistical uncertainties. Although we find that these biases do not limit the constraints of the DES-SN5YR sample, future surveys with much higher statistics, lower systematics, and especially those that observe in the $u$ band will require these corrections as wavelength-dependent atmospheric effects are larger at shorter wavelengths. We also discuss limitations of our method and how they can be better accounted for in future surveys.

2023-04-04, **Sibling Rivalry: SNeIa Diversity and the Hubble Tension**, Richard S. Miller et.al., [2304.01831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01831v1)

 Thermonuclear supernovae, or Type-Ia supernovae (SNeIa), are an essential tool of cosmology. Precise cosmological constraints are extracted from a Hubble diagram defined by homogeneous distance indicators, but supernova homogeneity is not guaranteed. The degree of heterogeneity within the SNeIa parent population is unknown. In addition, event selections and standardization procedures are based on empirical, optically-measured observables rather than fundamental thermonuclear properties. Systematics are a natural consequence of event selection from a diverse parent population. Quantifying the impact of diversity-driven systematics is crucial to optimizing SNeIa as cosmic probes. In this work, the empirical observables are used to calibrate previously unidentified diversity-driven systematic uncertainties. The foundation of this approach is the concept of "supernova siblings'', two or more supernovae hosted by the same parent galaxy. Sibling-based calibrations isolate intrinsic differences between supernovae; they control for source distance and host galaxy dependencies that can conceal systematics or lead to their underestimation. Newly calibrated distance modulus uncertainties are approximately an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. The physical origin of these uncertainties is plausibly attributed to the diverse thermonuclear scenarios responsible for SNeIa and the inhomogeneous apparent magnitudes induced by this diversity. Systematics mitigation strategies are discussed. Cosmological parameter constraints extracted from a re-analysis of the Pantheon+ SNeIa dataset are weaker than previously reported. Agreement with early-Universe parameter estimates is achieved for a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, including a reduction of the Hubble Tension from $\sim$5$\sigma$ to <1$\sigma$.

 In this work, we obtain the error estimate of the rotation parameter $\beta$ from the core bounce phase of the characteristic gravitational wave signal of a rapidly rotating core collapse supernova (CCSN). We quantify the error with asymptotic expansions of the covariance of a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) in terms of inverse powers of Signal-Noise Ratio (SNR), this method has been previously applied to parameter estimation for compact binary coalescences. When the second order of this expansion is negligible, it indicates that the first order is a good approximation of the error that will have a matching filter approach when estimating $\beta$. The analysis indicates that we should be able to resolve the presence of rotation for the galactic and nearby extragalactic progenitors. We show that the estimation error $\Delta \beta$ can be as small as a few percent and is larger for small values of $\beta$.

 Aims. The treatment of astronomical image time series has won increasing attention in recent years. Indeed, numerous surveys following up on transient objects are in progress or under construction, such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey for Space and Time (LSST), which is poised to produce huge amounts of these time series. The associated scientific topics are extensive, ranging from the study of objects in our galaxy to the observation of the most distant supernovae for measuring the expansion of the universe. With such a large amount of data available, the need for robust automatic tools to detect and classify celestial objects is growing steadily. Methods. This study is based on the assumption that astronomical images contain more information than light curves. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on deep learning for classifying different types of space objects directly using images. We named our approach ConvEntion, which stands for CONVolutional attENTION. It is based on convolutions and transformers, which are new approaches for the treatment of astronomical image time series. Our solution integrates spatio-temporal features and can be applied to various types of image datasets with any number of bands. Results. In this work, we solved various problems the datasets tend to suffer from and we present new results for classifications using astronomical image time series with an increase in accuracy of 13%, compared to state-of-the-art approaches that use image time series, and a 12% increase, compared to approaches that use light curves.

2023-04-03, **Constraints on the frequency and mass content of r-process events derived from turbulent mixing in galactic disks**, A. N. Kolborg et.al., [2304.01144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01144v1)

 Metal-poor stars in the Milky Way (MW) halo display large star-to-star dispersion in their r-process abundance relative to lighter elements. This suggests a chemically diverse and unmixed interstellar medium (ISM) in the early Universe. This study aims to help shed light on the impact of turbulent mixing, driven by core collapse supernovae (cc-SNe), on the r-process abundance dispersal in galactic disks. To this end, we conduct a series of simulations of small-scale galaxy patches which resolve metal mixing mechanisms at parsec scales. Our set-up includes cc-SNe feedback and enrichment from r-process sources. We find that the relative rate of the r-process events to cc-SNe is directly imprinted on the shape of the r-process distribution in the ISM with more frequent events causing more centrally peaked distributions. We consider also the fraction of metals that is lost on galactic winds and find that cc-SNe are able to efficiently launch highly enriched winds, especially in smaller galaxy models. This result suggests that smaller systems, e.g. dwarf galaxies, may require higher levels of enrichment in order to achieve similar mean r-process abundances as MW-like progenitors systems. Finally, we are able to place novel constraints on the production rate of r-process elements in the MW, $6 \times 10^{-7} {M\_\odot / \rm yr} \lesssim \dot{m}\_{\rm rp} \ll 4.7 \times 10^{-4} {M\_\odot / \rm yr} $, imposed by accurately reproducing the mean and dispersion of [Eu/Fe] in metal-poor stars. Our results are consistent with independent estimates from alternate methods and constitute a significant reduction in the permitted parameter space.

2023-04-03, **Investigating the gamma-ray burst from decaying MeV-scale axion-like particles produced in supernova explosions**, Eike Müller et.al., [2304.01060v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01060v1)

 We investigate the characteristics of the gamma-ray signal following the decay of MeV-scale Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) coupled to photons which are produced in a Supernova (SN) explosion. This analysis is the first to include the production of heavier ALPs through the photon coalescence process, enlarging the mass range of ALPs that could be observed in this way and giving a stronger bound from the observation of SN 1987A. Furthermore, we present a new analytical method for calculating the predicted gamma-ray signal from ALP decays. With this method we can rigorously prove the validity of an approximation that has been used in some of the previous literature, which we show here to be valid only if all gamma rays arrive under extremely small observation angles (i.e. very close to the line of sight to the SN). However, it also shows where the approximation is not valid, and offers an efficient alternative to calculate the ALP-induced gamma-ray flux in a general setting when the observation angles are not guaranteed to be small. We also estimate the sensitivity of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) to this gamma-ray signal from a future nearby SN and show that in the case of a non-observation the current bounds on the ALP-photon coupling $ g\_{a\gamma} $ are strengthened by about an order of magnitude. In the case of an observation, we show that it may be possible to reconstruct the product $ g\_{a\gamma}^2 m\_a $, with $ m\_a $ the mass of the ALP.
