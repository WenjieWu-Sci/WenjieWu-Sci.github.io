2024-06-04, **Non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry**, Bu-Yao Qu et.al., [2406.02527v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02527v1)

 The formalism of non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry is developed, and the Yukawa couplings are level $N$ polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms satisfying the Laplacian condition. We find that the integer (even) weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms of level $N$ can be decomposed into multiplets of the finite modular group $\Gamma'\_N$ ($\Gamma\_N$). The original modular invariance approach is extended by the presence of negative weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms. The non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry can be consistently combined with the generalized CP symmetry. We present three example models for lepton sector based on the $\Gamma\_3\cong A\_4$ modular symmetry, the charged lepton masses and the neutrino oscillation data can be accommodated very well, and the predictions for the leptonic CP violation phases and the effective Majorana neutrino mass are studied.

2024-06-04, **First demonstration of a TES based cryogenic Li$_2$MoO$_4$detector for neutrinoless double beta decay search**, G. Bratrud et.al., [2406.02025v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02025v1)

 Cryogenic calorimetric experiments to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) are highly competitive, scalable and versatile in isotope. The largest planned detector array, CUPID, is comprised of about 1500 individual Li$\_2^{100}$MoO$\_{4}$ detector modules with a further scale up envisioned for a follow up experiment (CUPID-1T). In this article, we present a novel detector concept targeting this second stage with a low impedance TES based readout for the Li$\_2$MoO$\_{4}$ absorber that is easily mass-produced and lends itself to a multiplexed readout. We present the detector design and results from a first prototype detector operated at the NEXUS shallow underground facility at Fermilab. The detector is a 2-cm-side cube with 21$\,$g mass that is strongly thermally coupled to its readout chip to allow rise-times of $\sim$0.5$\,$ms. This design is more than one order of magnitude faster than present NTD based detectors and is hence expected to effectively mitigate backgrounds generated through the pile-up of two independent two neutrino decay events coinciding close in time. Together with a baseline resolution of 1.95$\,$keV (FWHM) these performance parameters extrapolate to a background index from pile-up as low as $5\cdot 10^{-6}\,$counts/keV/kg/yr in CUPID size crystals. The detector was calibrated up to the MeV region showing sufficient dynamic range for $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches. In combination with a SuperCDMS HVeV detector this setup also allowed us to perform a precision measurement of the scintillation time constants of Li$\_2$MoO$\_{4}$. The crystal showed a significant fast scintillation emission with O(10$\,\mu$s) time-scale, more than an order below the detector response of presently considered light detectors suggesting the possibility of further progress in pile-up rejection through better light detectors in the future.

2024-06-03, **Managing the Growing Complexity of Multi-Messenger Transient Events with Astro-COLIBRI**, Fabian Schüssler et.al., [2406.01817v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01817v1)

 Observations of transient phenomena, such as GRBs, FRBs, novae/supernovae explosions, coupled with the detection of cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves, have transformed astrophysics. Maximizing the discovery potential necessitates tools for swiftly acquiring an overview of the most relevant information for each new detection. Introducing Astro-COLIBRI, a comprehensive platform designed to meet this challenge. Astro-COLIBRI features a public API, real-time databases and alert systems, a discussion forum, and a website and iOS/Android apps as user clients. In real time, it evaluates incoming astronomical observation messages from all available alert streams, filters them based on user-defined criteria, and contextualizes them in the multi-wavelength (MWL) and multi-messenger (MM) context. User clients offer a graphical representation, providing a succinct summary for quick identification of interesting phenomena and assessing observing conditions globally.

2024-06-03, **SIREN: An Open Source Neutrino Injection Toolkit**, Austin Schneider et.al., [2406.01745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01745v1)

 Modeling of rare neutrino processes often relies on either simple approximations or expensive detector simulations. The former is often not sufficient for interactions with complex morphologies, while the latter is too time-intensive for phenomenological studies. We present SIREN (Sampling and Injection for Rare EveNts), a new tool for neutrino phenomenology and experimental searches alike that enables accurate interaction and detector geometry modeling without the overhead of detailed detector response simulations. SIREN handles the injection of rare process final states and the associated weighting calculations with the speed needed for phenomenological investigations and the detail necessary for dedicated experimental searches. The extensible design of SIREN allows it to support a wide range of experimental designs and Beyond-Standard-Model neutrino interactions. Users need only specify the physical process, detector geometry, and initial neutrino flux under consideration before they can accurately simulate a model in their detector of choice. We demonstrate the capability of SIREN through two examples: (1) Standard Model $\nu\_\mu$ deep inelastic scattering in IceCube, DUNE, and ATLAS; and (2) heavy neutral lepton interactions in MiniBooNE, MINER$\nu$A, CCM. A variety of detector geometry descriptions, interaction cross sections, and neutrino fluxes are also provided for users to get started with immediately.

2024-06-03, **Neutrino Anarchy from Flavor Deconstruction**, Admir Greljo et.al., [2406.01696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01696v1)

 Flavor deconstruction refers to non-universal gauge extensions where the original gauge symmetry is deconstructed into separate copies, one for each family. A hierarchical chain of symmetry breaking provides an attractive low-scale solution to the flavor puzzle, consistent with flavor-changing neutral currents and finite naturalness. Although successful in explaining the origin of flavor hierarchies in the quark and charged lepton sectors, existing models have struggled with the large and seemingly anarchic mixing observed in neutrino oscillations. This letter identifies conditions under which neutrino anarchy may arise from flavor deconstruction in generic models with right-handed neutrinos. When deconstruction is applied to carefully chosen subgroups of the extended gauge symmetry, hierarchies in the seesaw formula cancel out.

2024-06-03, **Effects of Neutrino-Ultralight Dark Matter Interaction on the Cosmic Neutrino Background**, Pablo Martínez-Miravé et.al., [2406.01682v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01682v1)

 Ultralight dark matter interacting with sterile neutrinos would modify the evolution and properties of the cosmic neutrino background through active-sterile neutrino mixing. We investigate how such an interaction would induce a redshift dependence in neutrino masses. We highlight that cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses would require reinterpretation due to the effective mass generated by neutrino-dark matter interactions. Furthermore, we present an example where such interactions can alter the mass ordering of neutrinos in the early Universe, compared to what we expect today. We also address the expected changes in the event rates in a PTOLEMY-like experiment, which aims to detect the cosmic neutrino background via neutrino capture, and discuss projected constraints.

2024-06-03, **Searching for heavy millicharged particles from the atmosphere**, Han Wu et.al., [2406.01668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01668v1)

 If millicharged particles (MCPs) exist they can be created in the atmosphere when high energy cosmic rays collide with nuclei and could subsequently be detected at neutrino experiments. We extend previous work, which considered MCPs from decays of light mesons and proton bremsstrahlung, by including production from $\Upsilon$ meson decays and the Drell-Yan process. MCPs with masses below a GeV primarily arise from proton bremsstrahlung, while heavier MCPs predominantly originate from heavy meson decays and Drell-Yan. We analyse the resulting single scatter and multiple scatter signals at SuperK and JUNO. Searches for low energy coincident signals at JUNO will be sensitive to MCPs with milli-charges up to an order of magnitude beyond current constraints for MCP masses between 2 GeV and 10 GeV.

2024-06-03, **Weyl Fermion Creation by Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background at 1-loop**, Azadeh Maleknejad et.al., [2406.01534v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01534v1)

 Weyl fermions of spin $\frac12$ minimally coupled to Einstein's gravity in 4 dimensions cannot be produced purely gravitationally in an expanding Universe at tree level. Surprisingly, as we showed in a recent letter [1], this changes at gravitational 1-loop when cosmic perturbations, like a gravitational wave background, are present. Such a background introduces a new scale, thereby breaking the fermions' conformal invariance. This leads to a non-vanishing gravitational self-energy for Weyl fermions at 1-loop and induces their production. In this paper, we present an extended study of this new mechanism, explicitly computing this effect using the in-in formalism. We work in an expanding Universe in the radiation-dominated era as a fixed background. Gravitational wave-induced fermion production has rich phenomenological consequences. Notably, if Weyl fermions eventually acquire mass, and assuming realistic - and potentially detectable - gravitational wave backgrounds, the mechanism can explain the abundance of dark matter in the Universe. More generally, gravitational-wave induced freeze-in is a new purely gravitational mechanism for generating other feebly interacting fermions, e.g. right-handed neutrinos. We show that this loop level effect can dominate over the conventional - tree-level - gravitational production of superheavy fermions in a sizable part of the parameter space.

2024-06-03, **Relic neutrino decay: a solution to the excess radio background**, Rishav Roshan et.al., [2406.01415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01415v1)

 The detection of excess radio background detected by ARCADE 2 suggests the presence of new physics as there exists no clear astrophysical solution. We find that the radiative decay of a relic neutrino into a sterile neutrino, assumed to be quasi-degenerate, provides a very good fit to ARCADE 2 data. The solution also predicts a stronger 21 cm absorption global signal than the predicted one from the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a contrast brightness temperature. The solution obtained is in mild tension with a much stronger signal claimed by the EDGES collaboration.

2024-06-03, **Probing flavored regimes of leptogenesis with gravitational waves from cosmic strings**, Marco Chianese et.al., [2406.01231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01231v1)

 Cosmic strings radiate detectable gravitational waves in models featuring high-scale symmetry breaking, e.g., high-scale leptogenesis. In this Letter, for the first time, we show that different flavored regimes of high-scale leptogenesis can be tested distinctly with the spectral features in cosmic string-radiated gravitational waves. This is possible if the scalar field that makes right-handed neutrinos massive is feebly coupled to the Standard Model Higgs. Each flavored regime, sensitive to low-energy neutrino experiments, leaves a marked imprint on the gravitational waves spectrum. A three-flavor and a two-flavor regime could be probed by a characteristic fall-off of the gravitational wave spectrum at the LISA-DECIGO-ET frequency bands with preceding scale-invariant amplitudes bounded from above and below. We present Gravitational Waves windows for Flavored Regimes of Leptogenesis (GWFRL) falsifiable in the upcoming experiments.

2024-06-03, **Mapping the sources of CP violation in neutrino oscillations from the seesaw mechanism**, Zhi-zhong Xing et.al., [2406.01142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01142v1)

 We present the first complete calculation of the Jarlskog invariant, a working measure of the strength of CP violation in the flavor oscillations of three light neutrino species, with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the flavor structure in the canonical seesaw mechanism. We find that this invariant depends on 240 linear combinations of the 6 original phase parameters that are responsible for CP violation in the decays of three heavy Majorana neutrinos in 27 linear combinations as a whole, and thus provides the first model-independent connection between the microscopic and macroscopic matter-antimatter asymmetries.

2024-06-03, **Neutrino observables in gauged $U(1)_{L_α-L_β}$ models with two Higgs doublet and one singlet scalars**, Yuanchao Lou et.al., [2406.01030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01030v1)

 We discuss neutrino sector in models with two Higgs doublet and one singlet scalar fields under local $U(1)\_{L\_\alpha- L\_\beta}$ symmetry. A neutrino mass matrix is formulated for these models where the matrix is generated via type-I seesaw mechanism introducing right-handed neutrinos. The neutrino mass matrix has more degrees of freedom compared to minimal scenarios which have only one new scalar field, but its structure is still restricted by the symmetry. Then it is find that sum of neutrino mass can be lower than minimal scenarios and it is easier to satisfy observed constraints. In addition, we can fit neutrino data for $U(1)\_{L\_e - L\_{\mu(\tau)}}$ cases which are disfavored in minimal models. Furthermore, some correlations among sum of neutrino mass and CP violating phases are still found although we have more free parameters.

2024-06-03, **Measurement of Electron Antineutrino Oscillation Amplitude and Frequency via Neutron Capture on Hydrogen at Daya Bay**, Daya Bay collaboration et.al., [2406.01007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01007v1)

 This Letter reports the first measurement of the oscillation amplitude and frequency of reactor antineutrinos at Daya Bay via neutron capture on hydrogen using 1958 days of data. With over 3.6 million signal candidates, an optimized candidate selection, improved treatment of backgrounds and efficiencies, refined energy calibration, and an energy response model for the capture-on-hydrogen sensitive region, the relative $\overline{\nu}\_{e}$ rates and energy spectra variation among the near and far detectors gives $\mathrm{sin}^22\theta\_{13} = 0.0759\_{-0.0049}^{+0.0050}$ and $\Delta m^2\_{32} = (2.72^{+0.14}\_{-0.15})\times10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ assuming the normal neutrino mass ordering, and $\Delta m^2\_{32} = (-2.83^{+0.15}\_{-0.14})\times10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ for the inverted neutrino mass ordering. This estimate of $\sin^2 2\theta\_{13}$ is consistent with and essentially independent from the one obtained using the capture-on-gadolinium sample at Daya Bay. The combination of these two results yields $\mathrm{sin}^22\theta\_{13}= 0.0833\pm0.0022$, which represents an 8% relative improvement in precision regarding the Daya Bay full 3158-day capture-on-gadolinium result.

2024-06-03, **Exploration of mass splitting and muon/tau mixing parameters for an eV-scale sterile neutrino with IceCube**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2406.00905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00905v1)

 We present the first three-parameter fit to a 3+1 sterile neutrino model using 7.634 years of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory on $\nu\_\mu+\overline{\nu}\_\mu$ charged-current interactions in the energy range 500-9976 GeV. Our analysis is sensitive to the mass-squared splitting between the heaviest and lightest mass state ($\Delta m\_{41}^2$), the mixing matrix element connecting muon flavor to the fourth mass state ($\|U\_{\mu4}\|^2$), and the element connecting tau flavor to the fourth mass state ($\|U\_{\tau4}\|^2$). Predicted propagation effects in matter enhance the signature through a resonance as atmospheric neutrinos from the Northern Hemisphere traverse the Earth to the IceCube detector at the South Pole. The result is consistent with the no-sterile neutrino hypothesis with a probability of 4.3 %. Profiling the likelihood of each parameter yields the 90 % confidence levels: $ 2.4\,\mathrm{eV}^{2} < \Delta m\_{41}^2 <9.6\,\mathrm{eV}^{2} $ , $0.0081 < \|U\_{\mu4}\|^2 < 0.10$ , and $\|U\_{\tau4}\|^2< 0.035$, which narrows the allowed parameter-space for $\|U\_{\tau4}\|^2$. However, the primary result of this analysis is the first map of the 3+1 parameter space exploring the interdependence of $\Delta m\_{41}^2$, $\|U\_{\mu4}\|^2$, and $\|U\_{\tau4}\|^2$.

2024-06-04, **Probing the Scalar WIMP-Pion Coupling with the first LUX-ZEPLIN data**, J. Aalbers et.al., [2406.02441v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02441v1)

 Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) may interact with a virtual pion that is exchanged between nucleons. This interaction channel is important to consider in models where the spin-independent isoscalar channel is suppressed. Using data from the first science run of the LUX-ZEPLIN dark matter experiment, containing 60 live days of data in a 5.5~tonne fiducial mass of liquid xenon, we report the results on a search for WIMP-pion interactions. We observe no significant excess and set an upper limit of $1.5\times10^{-46}$~cm$^2$ at a 90\% confidence level for a WIMP mass of 33~GeV/c$^2$ for this interaction.

2024-06-04, **Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter**, Lorenz Zwick et.al., [2406.02306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02306v1)

 With the recent announcement by NASA's Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. By employing a methodology to stack tracking data in combination with Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain parameter recovery tests, we show that the mission will be sensitive to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-1}$ Hz, provided that tracking data is taken consistently over a large fraction of the cruise duration. Thus, the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. Within this assumption, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(1 - 100)$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.

2024-06-04, **Constrained cosmological simulations of the Local Group using Bayesian hierarchical field-level inference**, Ewoud Wempe et.al., [2406.02228v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02228v1)

 We present a novel approach based on Bayesian field-level inference capable of resolving individual galaxies within the Local Group (LG), enabling detailed studies of its structure and formation via posterior simulations. We extend the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm with a multi-resolution approach, allowing us to reach smaller mass scales and apply observational constraints based on LG galaxies. Our updated data model simultaneously accounts for observations of mass tracers within the dark haloes of the Milky Way (MW) and M31, their observed separation and relative velocity, and the quiet surrounding Hubble flow represented through the positions and velocities of galaxies at distances from one to four Mpc. Our approach delivers representative posterior samples of $\Lambda$CDM realisations that are statistically and simultaneously consistent with all these observations, leading to significantly tighter mass constraints than found if the individual datasets are considered separately. In particular, we estimate the virial masses of the MW and M31 to be $\log\_{10}(M\_{200c}/M\_\odot) = 12.07\pm0.08$ and $12.33\pm0.10$, respectively, their sum to be $\log\_{10}(\Sigma M\_{200c}/M\_\odot)= 12.52\pm0.07$, and the enclosed mass within spheres of radius $R$ to be $\log\_{10}(M(R)/M\_\odot)= 12.71\pm0.06$ and $12.96\pm0.08$ for $R=1$ Mpc and 3 Mpc, respectively. The M31-MW orbit is nearly radial for most of our $\Lambda$CDM LG's, and most lie in a dark matter sheet that aligns approximately with the Supergalactic Plane, even though the surrounding density field was not used explicitly as a constraint. The approximate simulations employed in our inference are accurately reproduced by high-fidelity structure formation simulations, demonstrating the potential for future high-resolution, full-physics $\Lambda$CDM posterior simulations of LG look-alikes.

2024-06-04, **Quantum Statistical Effects on Warm Dark Matter and the Mass Constraint from the Cosmic Large Scale Structure**, Zhijian Zhang et.al., [2406.02159v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02159v1)

 The suppression of small-scale matter power spectrum is a distinct feature of Warm Dark Matter (WDM), which permits a constraint on the WDM mass from galaxy surveys. In the thermal relic WDM scenario, quantum statistical effects are not manifest. In a unified framework, we investigate the quantum statistical effects for a fermion case with a degenerate pressure and a boson case with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Compared to the thermal relic case, the degenerate fermion case only slightly lowers the mass bound while the boson case with a high initial BEC fraction ($\gtrsim90\%$) significantly lowers it. On the other hand, the BEC fraction drops during the relativistic-to-nonrelativistic transition and completely disappears if the initial fraction is below $\sim64\%$. Given the rising interest in resolving the late-time galaxy-scale problems with boson condensation, a question is posed on how a high initial BEC fraction can be dynamically created so that a DM condensed component remains today.

2024-06-04, **Euler-Heisenberg black hole surrounded by quintessence in the background of perfect fluid dark matter: Thermodynamics, Shadows and Quasinormal modes**, B. Hamil et.al., [2406.02109v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02109v1)

 Current observations show that a significant fraction of the Universe is composed of dark energy and dark matter. In this paper, we investigate the simultaneous effects of these dark sectors on the Euler-Heisenberg black hole, using the quintessence matter field and perfect fluid to model them. In particular, we study the black hole's thermodynamics, shadows, and quasinormal modes, and discuss in detail how these properties change with relatively large or small dark sector components.

2024-06-04, **Cosmological dynamics of interacting dark energy and dark matter in $f(Q)$ gravity**, Gaurav N. Gadbail et.al., [2406.02026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02026v1)

 In this work, we explore the behavior of interacting dark energy and dark matter within a model of $f(Q)$ gravity, employing a standard framework of dynamical system analysis. We consider the power-law $f(Q)$ model incorporating with two different forms of interacting dark energy and dark matter: $3\alpha H\rho\_m$ and $\frac{\alpha}{3H}\rho\_m \rho\_{DE}$. The evolution of $\Omega\_m, \Omega\_r, \Omega\_{DE}, q$, and $\omega$ for different values of the model parameter $n$ and the interaction parameter $\alpha$ has been examined. Our results show that the universe was dominated by matter in the early stages and will be dominated by dark energy in later stages. Using the observational data, the fixed points are found to be stable and can be represented the de Sitter and quintessence acceleration solutions. We discover that the dynamical profiles of the universe in $f(Q)$ dark energy models are influenced by both the interaction term and the relevant model parameters.

2024-06-03, **Reopening the Z portal with semi-annihilations**, María J. Domínguez et.al., [2406.01729v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01729v1)

 In one-component dark matter (DM) scenarios is commonly assumed that a scalar WIMP must either be part of an $SU(2)\_L$ multiplet with zero hypercharge or have suppressed vector interactions with the $Z$ gauge boson to circumvent stringent direct detection (DD) bounds. In this work, we demonstrate that multi-component scenarios with a dark scalar doublet exhibiting vector-like interactions with the $Z$ boson are also compatible with bounds arising from DD searches. Specifically, we consider a simple extension of the Standard Model wherein the dark sector comprises a doublet and a complex singlet $\phi$, both charged under a $Z\_6$ symmetry. We find that semi-annihilation processes drastically reduce the relic abundance of the neutral component of the doublet, $H^0$, sufficiently attenuating the effects of its large $Z$-mediated elastic scattering cross-section with nucleons to satisfy the DD constraints. Although the contribution of $H^0$ to the total relic abundance is nearly negligible, with $\phi$ dominating, both dark matter components are expected to be detectable in ongoing and future DD experiments. The viability of the model is tested against several theoretical and experimental constraints, resulting in a parameter space featuring a non-degenerate mass spectrum at the electroweak scale.

2024-06-03, **Dark Matter**, Marco Cirelli et.al., [2406.01705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01705v1)

 We review observational, experimental and theoretical results related to Dark Matter.

2024-06-03, **Baryonification extended to thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich**, Giovanni Aricò et.al., [2406.01672v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01672v1)

 Baryonification algorithms model the impact of galaxy formation and feedback on the matter field in gravity-only simulations by adopting physically motivated parametric prescriptions. In this paper, we extend these models to describe gas temperature and pressure, allowing for a self-consistent modelling of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, weak gravitational lensing, and their cross-correlation, down to small scales. We validate our approach by showing that it can simultaneously reproduce the electron pressure, gas, stellar, and dark matter power spectra as measured in all BAHAMAS hydrodynamical simulations. Specifically, with only two additional free parameters, we can fit the electron pressure auto- and cross-power spectra at 10% while reproducing the suppression in the matter power spectrum induced by baryons at the per cent level, for different AGN feedback strengths in BAHAMAS. Furthermore, we reproduce BAHAMAS convergence and thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich angular power spectra within 1% and 10% accuracy, respectively, down to l = 5000. When used jointly with cosmological rescaling algorithms, the baryonification presented here will allow a fast and accurate exploration of cosmological and astrophysical scenarios. Therefore, it can be employed to create mock catalogues, lightcones, and large training sets for emulators aimed at interpreting forthcoming multi-wavelength observations of the large-scale structure of the Universe.

2024-06-03, **Positive-Energy Dirac Particles and Dark Matter**, Eugene Bogomolny et.al., [2406.01654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01654v1)

 The relativistic positive-energy wave equation proposed by P. Dirac in 1971 is an old but largely forgotten subject. The purpose of this note is to speculate that particles described by this equation (called here Dirac particles) are natural candidates for the dark matter. The reasoning is based on a fact that the internal structure of such particles simply prohibits their interaction with electromagnetic fields (at least with the minimal coupling) which is exactly what is required for dark matter. Dirac particles have quite unusual properties. In particular, they are transformed by an infinite-dimensional representation of the homogeneous Lorentz group, which clearly distinguishes them from all known elementary particles described by finite-dimensional representations and hints to a physics beyond the Standard Model. To clarify the topic, a brief review of the main features of {the above-mentioned} Dirac equation is given.

2024-06-03, **Observational tests in scale invariance III: wide binary stars**, Andre Maeder et.al., [2406.01536v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01536v1)

 Recent studies of wide binary stars based on Gaia DR3 suggest that the relative orbital velocities of objects with separations s > 3'000 astronomical units are statistically larger than the standard Newtonian predictions. Obviously there is no Dark Matter halo arround binary stars that could be invoked to explain these high velocities. However, we explore the properties of two-body systems in the framework of scale invariant vacuum theory, focusing on the case of objects with extreme separations. In this regime, the additional acceleration term present in the modified Newton equation with scale invariance becomes important, and may even dominate the dynamical evolution at very low gravities. Comparisons with Gaia DR3 observations of wide binaries are performed and suggest that binaries with separations s > 3'000 astronomical units have experienced such an evolution for a few Gyr, accounting well for the observed velocity excesses.

2024-06-03, **Search for new particles in events with a hadronically decaying W or Z boson and large missing transverse momentum at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using the ATLAS detector**, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., [2406.01272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01272v1)

 A search is presented for new particles produced in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV that result in final states comprising a massive vector (W or Z) boson that decays hadronically and large missing transverse momentum. The data sample was collected with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider from 2015 to 2018 and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. No significant excess over the Standard Model expectation is observed. Model-independent 95% confidence-level limits on the visible cross-section that range from 0.3 fb to 79.5 fb are obtained for non-Standard-Model processes. Exclusion limits are also presented for models with axion-like particles, for two-Higgs-doublet models with a pseudo-scalar mediator between the Standard Model and the dark sector, for the invisible decay of the Higgs boson and for pair-produced weakly interacting dark matter candidates.

2024-06-04, **The story of SN 2021aatd -- a peculiar 1987A-like supernova with an early-phase luminosity excess**, T. Szalai et.al., [2406.02498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02498v1)

 There is a growing number of peculiar events that cannot be assigned to any of the main supernova (SN) classes. SN 1987A and a handful of similar objects, thought to be explosive outcomes of blue supergiant stars, belong to them: while their spectra closely resemble those of H-rich (IIP) SNe, their light-curve (LC) evolution is very different. Here we present the detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of SN 2021aatd, a peculiar Type II explosion: while its early-time evolution resembles that of the slowly evolving, double-peaked SN 2020faa (however, at a lower luminosity scale), after $\sim$40 days, its LC shape becomes similar to that of SN 1987A-like explosions. Beyond comparing LCs, color curves, and spectra of SN 2021aatd to that of SNe 2020faa, 1987A, and of other objects, we compare the observed spectra with our own SYN++ models and with the outputs of published radiative transfer models. We also modeled the pseudo-bolometric LCs of SNe 2021aatd and 1987A assuming a two-component (core+shell) ejecta, and involving the rotational energy of a newborn magnetar in addition to radioactive decay. We find that both the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2021aatd can be well described with the explosion of a $\sim$15 $M\_\odot$ blue supergiant star. Nevertheless, SN 2021aatd shows higher temperatures and weaker Na ID and Ba II 6142 A lines than SN 1987A, which is reminiscent of rather to IIP-like atmospheres. With the applied two-component ejecta model (counting with both decay and magnetar energy), we can successfully describe the bolometric LC of SN 2021aatd, including the first $\sim$40-day long phase showing an excess compared to 87A-like SNe but being strikingly similar to that of the long-lived SN 2020faa. Nevertheless, finding a unified model that also explains the LCs of more luminous events (like SN 2020faa) is still a matter of concern.

 Asteroseismology gives us the opportunity to look inside stars and determine their internal properties. Based on these observations, estimations can be made for the amount of the convective boundary mixing and envelope mixing of such stars, and the shape of the mixing profile in the envelope. However, these results are not typically included in stellar evolution models. We aim to investigate the impact of varying convective boundary mixing and envelope mixing in a range based on asteroseismic modelling in stellar models, both for the stellar structure and for the nucleosynthetic yields. In this first study, we focus on the pre-explosive evolution of a 20Msun star and evolve the models to the final phases of carbon burning. We vary the convective boundary mixing, implemented as step-overshoot, with the overshoot parameter in the range 0.05-0.4 and the amount of envelope mixing in the range 1-10$^{6}$ with a mixing profile based on internal gravity waves. We use a large nuclear network of 212 isotopes to study the nucleosynthesis. We find that enhanced mixing according to asteroseismology of main-sequence stars, both at the convective core boundary and in the envelope, has significant effects on the nucleosynthetic wind yields. Our evolutionary models beyond the main sequence diverge in yields from models based on rotational mixing, having longer helium burning lifetimes and lighter helium-depleted cores. We find that the asteroseismic ranges of internal mixing calibrated from core hydrogen burning stars lead to similar wind yields as those resulting from the theory of rotational mixing. Adopting the seismic mixing levels beyond the main sequence, we find earlier transitions to radiative carbon burning compared to models based on rotational mixing. This influences the compactness and the occurrence of shell-mergers, which may affect the supernova properties and explosive nucleosynthesis.

2024-06-04, **ZTF SN Ia DR2: Study of Type Ia Supernova lightcurve fits**, M. Rigault et.al., [2406.02073v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02073v1)

 Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology relies on the estimation of lightcurve parameters to derive precision distances that leads to the estimation of cosmological parameters. The empirical SALT2 lightcurve modeling that relies on only two parameters, a stretch x1, and a color c, has been used by the community for almost two decades. In this paper we study the ability of the SALT2 model to fit the nearly 3000 cosmology-grade SN Ia lightcurves from the second release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) cosmology science working group. While the ZTF data was not used to train SALT2, the algorithm is modeling the ZTF SN Ia optical lightcurves remarkably well, except for lightcurve points prior to -10 d from maximum, where the training critically lacks statistics. We find that the lightcurve fitting is robust against the considered choice of phase-range, but we show the [-10; +40] d range to be optimal in terms of statistics and accuracy. We do not detect any significant features in the lightcurve fit residuals that could be connected to the host environment. Potential systematic population differences related to the SN Ia host properties might thus not be accountable for by the addition of extra lightcurve parameters. However, a small but significant inconsistency between residuals of blue- and red-SN Ia strongly suggests the existence of a phase-dependent color term, with potential implications for the use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We thus encourage modellers to explore this avenue and we emphasize the importance that SN Ia cosmology must include a SALT2 retraining to accurately model the lightcurves and avoid biasing the derivation of cosmological parameters.

2024-06-04, **ZTF SN Ia DR2: Colour standardisation of Type Ia Supernovae and its dependence on environment**, M. Ginolin et.al., [2406.02072v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02072v1)

 As Type Ia supernova cosmology transitions from a statistics dominated to a systematics dominated era, it is crucial to understand leftover unexplained uncertainties affecting their luminosity, such as the ones stemming from astrophysical biases. Indeed, SNe Ia are standardisable candles, whose absolute magnitude reach a 0.15~mag scatter once empirical correlations with their lightcurve stretch and colour and with their environment are accounted for. In this paper, we investigate how the standardisation process of SNe Ia depends on environment, to ultimately reduce their scatter in magnitude, focusing on colour standardisation. We use the volume-limited ZTF SN Ia DR2 sample, which offers unprecedented statistics for the low redshift ($z<0.06$) range. We first study the colour distribution, focusing on the effects of dust, to then select a dustless subsample of objects from low stellar mass environments and from the outskirts of their host galaxies. We then look at the colour-residuals relation and its associated parameter $\beta$. Finally, we investigate the colour dependency of the environment-dependent magnitude offsets (steps), to try to disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic colour origin. Our sample probes well the red tail of the colour distribution, up to $c=0.8$. The dustless sample exhibits a significantly lower red tail ($4.6\sigma$) in comparison to the whole sample. This suggests that reddening above $c\geq0.2$ is dominated by host interstellar dust absorption. Looking at the colour-residuals relation, we find it to be linear with lightcurve colour. We show hints of a potential evolution of $\beta$ with host stellar mass at a $2.5\sigma$ level. Finally, unlike recent claims from the literature, we see no evolution of steps as a function of lightcurve colour, suggesting that dust may not be the dominating mechanism responsible for the environmental dependency of SNe Ia magnitude.

2024-06-03, **Dependence of the Reconstructed Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational Wave High-Frequency Feature on the Nuclear Equation of State, in Real Interferometric Data**, R. Daniel Murphy et.al., [2406.01784v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01784v1)

 We present an analysis of gravitational wave (GW) predictions from five two-dimensional Core Collapse Supernova (CCSN) simulations that varied only in the Equation of State (EOS) implemented. The GW signals from these simulations are used to produce spectrograms in the absence of noise, and the emergent high-frequency feature (HFF) is found to differ quantitatively between simulations. Below 1 kHz, the HFF is well approximated by a first-order polynomial in time. The resulting slope was found to vary between 10-50% across all models. Further, using real interferometric noise we investigated the current capabilities of GW detectors to resolve these differences in HFF slope for a Galactic CCSN. We find that for distances up to 1 kpc, current detectors can resolve HFF slopes that vary by at least 30%. For further Galactic distances, current detectors are capable of distinguishing the upper and lower bounds of the HFF slope for groupings of our models that varied in EOS. With the higher sensitivity of future GW detectors, and with improved analysis of the HFF, our ability to resolve properties of the HFF will improve for all Galactic distances. This study shows the potential of using the HFF of CCSN produced GWs to provide insight into the physical processes occurring deep within CCSN during collapse, and in particular its potential to further constrain the EOS through GW detection.

2024-06-03, **ZTF SN~Ia DR2: Cosmology-independent constraints on Type Ia supernova standardisation from supernova siblings**, S. Dhawan et.al., [2406.01434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01434v1)

 Understanding Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) and the empirical standardisation relations that make them excellent distance indicators is vital to improving cosmological constraints. SN~Ia ``siblings", i.e. two or more SNe~Ia in the same host or parent galaxy offer a unique way to infer the standardisation relations and their diversity across the population. We analyse a sample of 25 SN~Ia pairs, observed homogeneously by the Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF) to infer the SNe~Ia light curve width-luminosity and colour-luminosity parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Using the pairwise constraints from siblings, allowing for a diversity in the standardisation relations, we find $\alpha = 0.218 \pm 0.055 $ and $\beta = 3.084 \pm 0.312$, respectively, with a dispersion in $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of $\leq 0.195$ and $\leq 0.923$, respectively, at 95$\%$ C.L. While the median dispersion is large, the values within $\sim 1 \sigma$ are consistent with no dispersion. Hence, fitting for a single global standardisation relation, we find $\alpha = 0.228 \pm 0.029 $ and $\beta = 3.160 \pm 0.191$. We find a very small intrinsic scatter of the siblings sample $\sigma\_{\rm int} \leq 0.10$ at 95\% C.L. compared to $\sigma\_{\rm int} = 0.22 \pm 0.04$ when computing the scatter using the Hubble residuals without comparing them as siblings. Splitting the sample based on host galaxy stellar mass, we find that SNe~Ia in both subsamples have consistent $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The $\beta$ value is consistent with the value for the cosmological sample. However, we find a higher $\alpha$ by $\sim 2.5 - 3.5 \sigma$. The high $\alpha$ is driven by low $x\_1$ pairs, potentially suggesting that the slow and fast declining SN~Ia have different slopes of the width-luminosity relation. We can confirm or refute this with increased statistics from near future time-domain surveys. (abridged)

2024-06-03, **Exploring Origin of Ultra-Long Gamma-ray Bursts: Lessons from GRB 221009A**, Amit Kumar Ror et.al., [2406.01220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01220v1)

 The brightest Gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever, GRB 221009A, displays ultra-long GRB (ULGRB) characteristics, with a prompt emission duration exceeding 1000 s. To constrain the origin and central engine of this unique burst, we analyze its prompt and afterglow characteristics and compare them to the established set of similar GRBs. To achieve this, we statistically examine a nearly complete sample of Swift-detected GRBs with measured redshifts. Categorizing the sample to Bronze, Silver, and Gold by fitting a Gaussian function to the log-normal of T$\_{90}$ duration distribution and considering three sub-samples respectively to 1, 2, and 3 times of the standard deviation to the mean value. GRB 221009A falls into the Gold sub-sample. Our analysis of prompt emission and afterglow characteristics aims to identify trends between the three burst groups. Notably, the Gold sub-sample (a higher likelihood of being ULGRB candidates) suggests a collapsar scenario with a hyper-accreting black hole as a potential central engine, while a few GRBs (GRB 060218, GRB 091024A, and GRB 100316D) in our Gold sub-sample favor a magnetar. Late-time near-IR (NIR) observations from 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) rule out the presence of any bright supernova associated with GRB 221009A in the Gold sub-sample. To further constrain the physical properties of ULGRB progenitors, we employ the tool MESA to simulate the evolution of low-metallicity massive stars with different initial rotations. The outcomes suggest that rotating ($\Omega \geq 0.2\,\Omega\_{\rm c}$) massive stars could potentially be the progenitors of ULGRBs within the considered parameters and initial inputs to MESA.

2024-06-03, **ZTF SN Ia DR2: Impact of the galaxy cluster environment on the stretch distribution of Type Ia supernovae**, F. Ruppin et.al., [2406.01108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01108v1)

 Understanding the impact of the astrophysical environment on Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) properties is crucial to minimize systematic uncertainties in cosmological analyses based on this probe. We investigate the dependence of the SN Ia SALT2.4 light-curve stretch on the distance from their nearest galaxy cluster to study a potential effect of the intracluster medium (ICM) environment on SN Ia intrinsic properties. We use the largest SN Ia sample to date and cross-match it with existing X-ray, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich, and optical cluster catalogs in order to study the dependence between stretch and distance to the nearest detected cluster from each SN Ia. We model the underlying stretch distribution with a Gaussian mixture with relative amplitudes that depend on redshift and cluster-centric distance. We find a significant improvement of the fit quality of the stretch distribution if we include the distance-dependant term in the model with a variation of the Akaike information criterion $\rm{\Delta AIC} = -10.2$. Because of the known correlation between galaxy age and distance from cluster center, this supports previous evidence that the age of the stellar population is the underlying driver of the bimodial shape of the SN Ia stretch distribution. We further compute the evolution of the fraction of quenched galaxies as a function of distance with respect to cluster center from our best-fit model of the SNe Ia stretch distribution and compare it to previous results obtained from $H\alpha$ line measurements, optical broadband photometry, and simulations. We find our estimate to be compatible with these results. The results of this work indicate that SNe Ia searches at high redshift targeted towards clusters to maximize detection probability should be considered with caution as the stretch distribution of the detected sample would be strongly biased towards the old sub-population of SNe Ia.

2024-06-03, **Progenitor and explosion properties of SN 2023ixf estimated based on a light-curve model grid of Type II supernovae**, Takashi J. Moriya et.al., [2406.00928v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00928v1)

 We estimate the progenitor and explosion properties of the nearby Type II SN 2023ixf using a synthetic model grid of Type II supernova light curves. By comparing the light curves of SN 2023ixf with the pre-existing grid of Type II supernovae containing about 228,000 models with different combinations of the progenitor and explosion properties, we obtain the chi2 value for every model and evaluate the properties of the models providing small values of chi2. We found that the light-curve models with the progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass of 10 Msun, the explosion energy of (2-3)e51 erg, the 56Ni mass of 0.04-0.06 Msun, the mass-loss rate of 1e-3 - 1e-2 Msun/yr with a wind velocity of 10 km/s, and the dense, confined circumstellar matter radius of (6-10)e14 cm match well to the observed light curves of SN 2023ixf. The photospheric velocity evolution of these models is also consistent with the observed velocity evolution. Although our parameter estimation is based on a pre-existing model grid and we do not perform any additional computations, the estimated parameters are consistent with those obtained by the detailed modeling of SN 2023ixf previously reported. This result shows that comparing the pre-existing model grid is a reasonable way to obtain a rough estimate for the properties of Type II supernovae. This simple way to estimate the properties of Type II supernovae will be essential in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) era when thousands of Type II supernovae are expected to be discovered yearly.

2024-06-03, **Revisiting Gamma-Ray Emission of the Supernova Remnant RCW 103**, Yi Xing et.al., [2406.00903v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00903v1)

 We analyze more than 15 years of the \gr\ data, obtained with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}, for the region of the young supernova remnant (SNR) RCW~103, since the nearby source 4FGL J1616.2$-$5054e, counterpart to HESS~J1616$-$518 and $\simeq$13\,arcmin away from the SNR, is determined to be extended in the more recent Fermi-LAT source catalog. Different templates for 4FGL J1616.2$-$5054e and RCW~103 are tested, and we find that a point source with a power-law (PL) spectrum at the southern limb of the SNR best describes the detected gamma-ray emission. The photon index of the PL emission is $\Gamma\simeq 2.31$, softer than the previously reported $\Gamma\simeq 2.0$ when the counterpart to HESS~J1616$-$518 was considered to be a point source (which likely caused mis-identification of extended emission at RCW~103). In order to produce the \gr\ emission in a hadronic scenario, we estimate that protons with an index$\sim$2.4 PL energy distribution are needed. These results fit with those from multi-wavelength observations that have indicated the remnant at the southern limb is interacting with a molecular cloud.
