2026-02-16, **Dominant One-Loop Seesaw Contribution Induced by Non-Invertible Fusion Algebra**, Monal Kashav et.al., [2602.14644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14644v1)

 The topological classification of the one-loop Weinberg operator at dimension-5 enables a systematic categorization of radiative neutrino mass models. Among these, the category consisting loop-extended seesaw frameworks is theoretically appealing but conventional discrete or continuous symmetries (\emph{e.g.}, $U(1)$ or $\mathbb{Z}\_M$) cannot genuinely forbid the corresponding tree-level contributions, making loop dominance difficult to realize. We show that \textit{non-invertible selection rules} (NISRs) naturally enforce the absence of tree-level terms while ensuring a dominant one-loop contribution. Intriguingly, the same non-invertible structure also stabilizes the dark matter candidate, providing a unified radiative origin of neutrino mass and dark sector stability. In particular, we focus on the T4-2-$i$ topology which embodies a type-II one-loop seesaw and demonstrate its natural realization from $Z\_{7}$ Tambara--Yamagami (TY) fusion algebra.

2026-02-16, **Rephasing invariant structure of CP phase for simplified mixing matrices in Fritzsch--Xing parametrization**, Masaki J. S. Yang et.al., [2602.14513v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14513v1)

 In this paper, we construct an explicit rephasing transformation that converts an arbitrary unitary mixing matrix into the Fritzsch--Xing (FX) parametrization, which is obtained by trivializing arguments of the matrix elements in the third row and third column. We further analyzed the rephasing invariant structure of the FX phase $δ\_{\rm FX}$ under the approximation where the 1-3 element of the diagonalization matrix of charged leptons $U^{e}$ is neglected, $U\_{13}^{e} = 0$. As a result, in the limit where the 1-3 element of diagonalization of neutrinos $U^ν$ is also neglected,   we obtained a compact expression for the FX phase $δ\_{\rm FX} = \arg [ { U^{e}\_{11} U^{e}\_{12} U^{e}\_{33} } { U^{ν*}\_{11} U^{ν*}\_{12} U^{ν*}\_{33} / \det U^{e} \det U^{ν*} } ] - \arg [ 1 + ({U^{e *}\_{23} U^ν\_{23} / U^{e *}\_{33} U^ν\_{33}} ) ] $. In this limit, the FX phase is controlled by two independent relative phases between $U^{ν, e}$, and the FX phase for finite $U\_{13}^ν$ is understood as a generalization to the compact expression.

2026-02-16, **Search for Cosmic-Ray Produced Dark Meson via the $U(1)_\text{D}$ Portal at JUNO**, Zirong Chen et.al., [2602.14355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14355v1)

 We investigate the atmospheric production and subsequent detection of sub-GeV dark mesons within the framework of a confining dark sector coupled to the Standard Model (SM) via a $U(1)\_{\text{D}}$ vector portal. High-energy cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere produce dark quarks through proton bremsstrahlung, rare decay of Standard Model mesons, and Drell-Yan processes, which subsequently hadronize into dark mesons. We adopt a modified Quark Combination Model to describe the non-perturbative dark hadronization process, allowing for a detailed event-level characterization of the dark meson flux. We simulate the flux and the interaction of these relativistic dark mesons in the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) using the GENIE generator, considering both elastic scattering off nuclei and deep inelastic scattering channels. Based on the projected 20 kton$\cdot$year exposure, we derive sensitivity limits on the coupling strength between the dark gauge boson and the SM sector. Our results demonstrate that JUNO can probe substantial unexplored parameter space, particularly for light mediators ($m\_{Z^\prime} \lesssim 10$ MeV), where it achieves sensitivities to the portal interaction as low as $2.4 \times 10^{-4}$.

2026-02-15, **Measuring neutrino mixing above 1 TeV with astrophysical neutrinos**, Mauricio Bustamante et.al., [2602.14308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14308v1)

 We assess the potential for measuring neutrino mixing parameters at energies above 1~TeV, for the first time, using the flavor composition of TeV--PeV astrophysical neutrinos, i.e., the proportion of $ν\_e$, $ν\_μ$, and $ν\_τ$. Today, flavor measurements inferred from the 11.4-year IceCube Medium Energy Starting Events sample are insufficient to constrain the mixing parameters due to limited statistics, challenges in flavor identification, and uncertainty in neutrino production. Yet, upcoming multi-neutrino-telescope observations -- even using only existing telescopes -- may achieve sensitivity to $θ\_{23}$ and $θ\_{13}$ when combined with traditional oscillation experiments. We establish the current status and future prospects for testing the three-flavor mixing framework in the previously unexplored TeV--PeV regime and quantify the minimum detectable size of flavor-modifying beyond-Standard-Model effects, providing a roadmap for high-energy neutrino mixing measurements.

2026-02-15, **PeV neutrons as origin of separated SS433 TeV signals**, D. Fargion et.al., [2602.14212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14212v1)

 The SS433, a well-known binary system with an internal black hole, have shown since half a century, an inner (a few year light distances) twin precessing jets spirals. These beams are made by tidal forces while stripping mass from large stellar companion feeding an inner BH accretion disk and an orthogonal accelerating twin jet. From it, the radio, X gamma jet emission. A couple of years ago H.E.S.S telescope as well as HAWC and LHAASO array detectors, discovered also the surprising signature of an unexpected far twin separated gamma beam at tens TeV energy. At a hundred light years distances from its central source. We suggest that it is the legacy of a past rare eruption, a century ago, of tens PeV (10^16 eV) relativistic twin neutron beams. Their beta decay in flight at far distances, into proton, neutrino and in particular into tens TeV electrons, could feed the observed TeV gamma traces. They are originated by the same secondary tens TeV electrons emitting hard gamma, by Inverse Compton Scattering onto interstellar infrared photons.

2026-02-15, **Scale invariant radiative neutrino mass model**, Daijiro Suematsu et.al., [2602.14115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14115v1)

 We propose a scale invariant radiative neutrino mass model with custodial symmetry. Masses of an inert doublet scalar and right-handed neutrinos are induced by a vacuum expectation value (VEV) of a singlet scalar caused through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. It violates spontaneously both the custodial symmetry and the scale invariance. The weak scale can take a suppressed value compared with the singlet scalar VEV because of the custodial symmetry. In this framework we study phenomenological consequences for neutrino mass, dark matter and baryon number asymmetry. Since the required dark matter abundance cannot be explained by a neutral component of the inert doublet scalar, the lightest right-handed neutrino should be dark matter. Mass of the dark matter is predicted to be less than $O(1)$ MeV and baryon number asymmetry could be explained through resonant leptogenesis.

2026-02-16, **Prospects of Indirect Detection of Dark Matter via Primordial Black Hole Induced Gravitational Waves**, Debarun Paul et.al., [2602.15026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15026v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs), produced in the early Universe, can source a stochastic background of induced gravitational waves (GWs) and provide a non-thermal origin for dark matter (DM). We investigate DM production in a PBH-dominated cosmological framework, including contributions from PBH evaporation, gravitational production, and thermal freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms, and determine the regions consistent with the observed DM relic abundance. We find that thermal freeze-in can compensate for the underabundance of PBH-sourced DM, while indirect detection remains largely insensitive due to the feeble interaction strength, making future GW observatories such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope (ET) unique probes of this scenario. For freeze-out DM, indirect detection experiments constrain regions with relatively large annihilation cross-sections, whereas GW observations probe complementary regions with heavier DM masses and smaller interaction strengths. Consequently, the same DM parameter space cannot be simultaneously probed by both indirect detection searches and GW missions. These results establish GW observations as a powerful and independent probe of DM production in PBH-dominated cosmologies, opening a new observational window into DM properties and the thermal history of the pre-BBN Universe.

2026-02-16, **Gauge-independent gravitational waves from a minimal dark $U(1)$ sector with viable dark matter candidates**, Wan-Zhe Feng et.al., [2602.14866v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14866v1)

 Searches for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds from first-order phase transitions offer a powerful probe of hidden sectors, but quantitative predictions in gauge theories are obstructed by the gauge dependence of the finite-temperature effective potential and the associated tunneling action. We study a minimal gauged $U(1)$ dark sector containing a dark Higgs and a dark photon, optionally supplemented by a vectorlike dark fermion, coupled to the Standard Model through Higgs portal or kinetic mixing. Using the Nielsen identity together with a controlled derivative expansion and power counting, we construct a gauge-independent effective action in the high- and low-temperature limits, enabling model-intrinsic nucleation dynamics and robust gravitational wave predictions. We perform dedicated Monte Carlo scans in both limits and map viable microscopic parameters to detector-facing peak frequencies and amplitudes, spanning bands relevant to pulsar timing arrays and planned space-based interferometers. In our scans, supercooled transitions typically produce the strongest signals, whereas parametrically high-temperature transitions are comparatively rare and tend to be weak. We further connect the phase transition phenomenology to viable dark matter candidates within the same minimal field content, providing benchmark targets for dark photon dark matter and dark fermion dark matter, and highlighting their complementarity with gravitational wave observables. Overall, our results provide an end-to-end, gauge-independent pipeline from a minimal hidden sector Lagrangian to gravitational wave spectra and cosmologically viable dark matter benchmarks, yielding the most reliable and concrete predictions to date for a minimal gauged $U(1)$ dark sector.

2026-02-16, **Exploring Non-minimal coupling using ultra-diffuse galaxies**, Saboura Zamani et.al., [2602.14747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14747v1)

 We investigate whether a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can influence the internal dynamics of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Within this framework, the gravitational potential is modified by an additional term that captures the interaction between spacetime curvature and the dark matter with a coupling constant determined by a length scale $L$. Using spherical Jeans modeling, we analyze the kinematic data of three ultra-diffuse galaxies namely: NGC\;1052-DF2, NGC\;1052-DF4, and Dragonfly\;44, which span the observational extremes from dark matter deficient to dark matter dominated systems. For each galaxy we explore several dark matter halo profiles, two orbital anisotropy models, and both with and without Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation scenarios, and we perform a Bayesian parameter inference. Our results show that across all the considered configurations, the constrained astrophysical parameters are consistent with standard ones from General Relativity. The posterior distributions of $L$ show no preference for non-zero values and result only in upper limits, suggesting that any non-minimal coupling contribution must be small and perturbative on this scales. Future high precision velocity measurements will be essential to determine whether non-minimal coupling effects can become observationally distinguishable in low-acceleration systems.

2026-02-16, **Characterization of argon recoils at the keV scale with ReD and ReD+**, L. Pandola et.al., [2602.14538v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14538v1)

 The ReD experiment measured the ionization yield Qy of argon for nuclear recoils in the 2-10 keV range using a dual-phase Time Projection Chamber irradiated with neutrons from a Cf-252 fission source. The measurement extends coverage below 7 keV, confirms consistency with previous data above 7 keV, and indicates a higher Qy at lower energies. These results are relevant for argon-based experiments searching for dark matter in the form of low-mass Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, which are very sensitive to the modeling of the detector response in this energy range.

2026-02-16, **Back to Normal Again: Possible Destinies of JWST overmassive SMBHs and "Little Red Dots" in the View of Shin-Uchuu Simulation**, Haojie Hu et.al., [2602.14496v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14496v1)

 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the discovery of hundreds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $z\gtrsim 4-7$. A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M\_{\rm BH}/M\_\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these ``overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered ``overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M\_{\rm BH}/M\_\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M\_{\rm BH}/M\_\star \sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M\_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8~M\_\odot$ with $M\_{\rm BH}/M\_\star \sim 0.01$. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations. This suggests that the global feedback mechanisms regulating the coevolution of $M\_{\rm BH}/M\_\star$ ratios are implicitly encoded in local relations in terms of star-formation rate distribution, black hole accretion rate distribution and their active (quiescent) fractions.

2026-02-15, **$Λ(t)$CDM Model: Cosmological Implications and Dynamical System Analysis**, Himanshu Chaudhary et.al., [2602.14269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14269v1)

 We investigated a time-varying cosmological constant model using recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, combined with Type Ia supernova samples (Pantheon$^{+}$, DES-Dovekie, and Union3) and CMB shift parameters, to constrain the $Λ(t)$CDM model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. We find that the interaction term $Q(z)$ shows a sign change for all dataset combinations by crossing $Q(z)=0$, depending on the choice of the dataset: at low redshift $Q(z)<0$, indicating vacuum energy decaying into dark matter, while at high redshift $Q(z)>0$, corresponding to dark matter decaying into vacuum energy. The dynamical system analysis found three critical points, namely $P\_1,P\_2$, and $P\_3$ respectively. The resulting critical points, determined by the underlying cosmological parameters, correspond to distinct epochs in cosmic evolution. Depending on the parameter combinations, these points characterize various cosmological phases, ranging from an accelerated stiff matter-dominated era to late-time accelerated expansion. The stability of each critical point is analyzed using linear stability theory, with the relevant physical constraints on the cosmological parameters duly incorporated throughout the analysis. For each dataset combinations, the $Λ(t)$CDM model predicts that $ω\_0 > -1$, showing a preference for dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant scenario with $ω\_0 = -1$. Consequently, the model exhibits a transition phase in the range $N \equiv \log a(t) \approx -0.51$ to $-0.48$ and predicts $q\_0$ in the range $-0.54$ to $-0.52$, with the precise transition point depending on the choice of dataset. Finally, the Bayesian evidence shows strong support for the $Λ(t)$CDM model over $Λ$CDM

2026-02-15, **LIGHTS. The Thin Encircling Stellar Stream of NGC 3938**, Dennis Zaritsky et.al., [2602.14192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14192v1)

 We present a stellar stream found in images of the nearby, nearly face-on, late-type galaxy, NGC 3938 obtained for the LBT Imaging of Galactic Halos and Tidal Structures (LIGHTS) survey that is thin, has very low mean surface brightness ($\langleμ\_g\rangle \approx$ 28.7 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $\langleμ\_r\rangle \approx$ 28.1 mag arcsec$^{-2}$), appears to lie nearly on the plane of the sky, and wraps more than half way around a host galaxy that is otherwise apparently isolated. We estimate that the progenitor had a stellar mass of $\sim 3.7\times 10^7$ M$\_\odot$. Despite an intriguing apparent offset between the centroid of the host galaxy and the apparent center of the stream orbit, we find that we can reproduce the morphology, including this apparent off-centering, with simple models and standard assumptions about the host (thin disk centered within a canonical spherical dark matter halo) and the progenitor satellite orbit. We identify a number of detailed features of the stream, such as changes in curvature and density, that will require more complex models to reproduce. Even this rather simple system provides a rich set of constraints with which to explore the accretion history and gravitational potential of an otherwise unremarkable late-type galaxy. Given the depth of the LIGHTS images, this system is an example of the types of stellar stream that could be found in a majority of nearby giant galaxies with the 10-year stack of Rubin/LSST data.

2026-02-15, **Current status and prospects of light bino-higgsino dark matter in natural SUSY**, XinTian Wang et.al., [2602.14088v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14088v1)

 Given recent advancements in dark matter (DM) search experiments, particularly the latest LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) direct detection (DD) results, we systematically investigate the light bino-higgsino DM scenario within the natural supersymmetric framework. Requiring the electroweak fine-tuning parameter $Δ\_{\text{EW}} < 30$ fixes the higgsino mass parameter in the range $\|μ\| \in [100, 350]$ GeV, while we extend the bino mass to $M\_1 \in [10, 350]$ GeV. Incorporating constraints from Higgs physics, rare $B$ decays, LEP limits, and DD experiments, we find that part of the parameter space remains viable. However, the relic density of neutralino DM necessarily lies below the observed Planck value, contributing at most $\sim 2\%$ of the total DM abundance. Some of the surviving parameter space is already excluded by current 13 TeV LHC searches, while the future 14 TeV HL-LHC with 3000 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity will probe the remaining region.

2026-02-15, **The Theoretical Landscape of Mimetic Gravity: A Comprehensive Review**, O. Malaeb et.al., [2602.14082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14082v1)

 Mimetic gravity has emerged as a compelling extension of General Relativity (GR), originally motivated by the attempt to isolate the conformal degree of freedom of the gravitational field. By reparametrizing the physical metric in terms of an auxiliary metric and a scalar field, the theory naturally gives rise to a longitudinal degree of freedom that mimics the behavior of cold dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the theoretical landscape of mimetic gravity and its multifaceted applications to cosmology and high-energy physics. We begin by examining the original formulation and addressing the fundamental question of its equivalence to GR, highlighting how a singular disformal transformation introduces new physical degrees of freedom. We then explore minimal generalizations that lead to unified cosmological models, including mimetic matter scenarios and extensions into $f(R, φ)$ gravity, which allow for the reconstruction of any desired expansion history. Significant attention is given to the ``limiting curvature'' hypothesis through $f(\Box φ)$ modifications, providing a classical mechanism for resolving cosmological and black hole singularities. We critically assess the challenges facing the theory, specifically the gradient and ghost instabilities identified in cosmological perturbations, and discuss modern resolutions such as ghost-free mimetic massive gravity and covariant formulations of Hořava gravity. Finally, we discuss the role of the mimetic field in the early universe, specifically in the context of asymptotically free gravity and the resolution of the self-reproduction problem in inflation.

2026-02-16, **Exploring the magnetic field of the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar NGC 4631 X-8**, Amar Deo Chandra et.al., [2602.14876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14876v1)

 NGC 4631 X-8 is an ultraluminous X-ray pulsar (ULXP) having a spin period of about 9.7 s, discovered using XMM-Newton observations in 2025. The pulsar is known to show one of the largest spin-up rates ($\sim 9.6 \times 10^{-8}$ s s$^{-1}$) among the ULXP population. We explore the surface magnetic field of the neutron star in this source using different models, and find that the inferred magnetic field lies in the range of about $0.3-2 \times 10^{14}$G. We study the long-term magnetic field and spin period evolution of the pulsar assuming steady accretion using prevalent theoretical mechanisms and find that the pulsar will evolve to become a millisecond pulsar having decayed magnetic field of about $\sim 10^{9}$G in about a million years. The scenario of the formation of a millisecond pulsar is also probed using an estimate of the super-Eddington duty cycle of about 14% from the literature, which suggests that the neutron star would accrete sufficient matter to become a recycled millisecond pulsar. Exploring the magnetic field as well as the spin period evolution properties of ULXPs may enable us to understand the poorly understood evolutionary features of ULXPs, shed light on one of the pathways of millisecond pulsar formation and also help us to understand transient super-Eddington accretion phases in newborn magnetars, which are believed to power energetic events such as long gamma-ray bursts and Type I superluminous supernovae.

2026-02-16, **Evidence for the merger hypothesis in V4332 Sgr: a low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio and multiple outbursts**, D. P. K. Banerjee et.al., [2602.14781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14781v1)

 Following the detections of the first extragalactic ``Luminous Red Nova'' (LRN) M31 RV in 1989, and its first Galactic counterpart V4332~Sgr in 1994, there have been many discoveries of similar, or closely related, objects. They are important because they bridge the luminosity gap between the brightest novae and supernovae, a largely unexplored parameter space. The cause of eruptions in LRNe is still unclear, a stellar merger being the most favored mechanism. However, barring V1309~Sco, there has been no direct evidence for a merger in the other objects. Here we present strong evidence that V4332~Sgr was a merger event. High resolution infrared observations of the CO fundamental band show an unusually small $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $3.5\pm1$. This indicates that a violent event had occurred, whose effects penetrated deep enough to allow CNO cycle processed $^{13}$C in the inner H burning shell to be brought to the surface. We rule out planetary ingestion, and propose that the eruption was due to a merger between V4332~Sgr and a companion star. It is shown that V4332~Sgr was likely surrounded by an edge-on disk before its eruption. If this disk was a flattened common envelope containing V4332~Sgr and a companion star, then a merger scenario would not be inconsistent. Furthermore, V4332~Sgr had multiple outbursts, previously unreported but an important piece of information, since multiple outbursts are a trait shared by many LRNe.

2026-02-16, **H.E.S.S. detection of the PSR J0855-4644 nebula**, F. Aharonian et.al., [2602.14640v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14640v1)

 HESS J0852-463 is a TeV γ-ray source located in the Galactic plane. The region consists of a supernova remnant (SNR, RX J0852.0-4622) with a shell-like morphology, commonly referred to as Vela Junior, and a pulsar denoted PSR J0855-4644. Pulsars are among the most efficient leptonic accelerators in our Galaxy, making this region particularly interesting to study. We utilise the most recent data taken by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), to investigate any γ-ray emission associated with the pulsar in this region, PSR J0855-4644. We applied a full forward folding method on the H.E.S.S. data. Utilising 3D modelling techniques, we evaluated the TeV γ-ray emission towards the various components of this complex system. The distinct energy-dependent morphology observed in our data motivates further investigation of this source. We resolved the emission in the Vela Junior region into various components, several of which correspond to the SNR itself. In particular, we find a new extended component which is coincident with the position of PSR J0855-4644. The spectrum follows a power-law distribution with a best-fit index of ΓE = 1.81 \pm 0.07stat which differs from the properties of the surrounding γ-ray emission of the Vela Junior SNR. A one-zone leptonic joint fit between the X-rays (from XMM-Newton) and γ-rays (from H.E.S.S.) leads to a lower limit on the magnetic field of 1.6μG and a spectral index of α = 1.88 \pm 0.01, in line with expectations of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). In this paper, we report the first detection of the PWN of PSR J0855-4644 at TeV energies with the H.E.S.S. experiment at a significance of 12.2σ. This is attributed to the advanced techniques of the 3D analysis. Based on the pulsar's characteristics, its PWN is consistent with the known TeV PWNe population in the Galaxy.

2026-02-16, **The Physical Properties of PS1-12sk and the Implications to Its Progenitor System**, Kai-Li Mi et.al., [2602.14427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14427v1)

 PS1-12sk is a type Ibn supernova (SN) found at the host environment showing no obvious ongoing star formation, which challenges the massive star explosion scenario. We use the ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction (CSI) and the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni models in the context of double white dwarf (WD) merger to fit the bolometric light curve (LC) of PS1-12sk, since the He emission lines at the photospheric phases indicated the interaction between the SN ejecta and He-rich CSM. We find that the CSI model failed to explain the LC, but the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni model can account for the bolometric LC. The derived masses of the two WDs and $^{56}$Ni are $\sim 0.70 M\_\odot$, $\sim 0.40 M\_\odot$, and $\sim 0.09\,M\_\odot$, respectively. The facts that the ejecta mass ($\sim 0.984 M\_\odot$) is well below the Chandrasekhar limit ($\sim 1.4 M\_\odot$) and that the $^{56}$Ni mass is comparable to the $^{56}$Ni yields of the explosions of some sub-Chandrasekhar explosion models support the scenario that PS1-12sk might be from a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion induced by the merger of two low-mass WDs. The derived innermost radius ($\sim 13.81 \times 10^{12}$ cm) and the mass of the CSM ($\sim 0.116 M\_\odot$) disfavor the possibility that the CSM was formed in the merger phase. We suggest that the flybys before the merger can account for the position and mass of the CSM.

 We investigated a time-varying cosmological constant model using recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, combined with Type Ia supernova samples (Pantheon$^{+}$, DES-Dovekie, and Union3) and CMB shift parameters, to constrain the $Λ(t)$CDM model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. We find that the interaction term $Q(z)$ shows a sign change for all dataset combinations by crossing $Q(z)=0$, depending on the choice of the dataset: at low redshift $Q(z)<0$, indicating vacuum energy decaying into dark matter, while at high redshift $Q(z)>0$, corresponding to dark matter decaying into vacuum energy. The dynamical system analysis found three critical points, namely $P\_1,P\_2$, and $P\_3$ respectively. The resulting critical points, determined by the underlying cosmological parameters, correspond to distinct epochs in cosmic evolution. Depending on the parameter combinations, these points characterize various cosmological phases, ranging from an accelerated stiff matter-dominated era to late-time accelerated expansion. The stability of each critical point is analyzed using linear stability theory, with the relevant physical constraints on the cosmological parameters duly incorporated throughout the analysis. For each dataset combinations, the $Λ(t)$CDM model predicts that $ω\_0 > -1$, showing a preference for dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant scenario with $ω\_0 = -1$. Consequently, the model exhibits a transition phase in the range $N \equiv \log a(t) \approx -0.51$ to $-0.48$ and predicts $q\_0$ in the range $-0.54$ to $-0.52$, with the precise transition point depending on the choice of dataset. Finally, the Bayesian evidence shows strong support for the $Λ(t)$CDM model over $Λ$CDM

2026-02-15, **Nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration with upstream escape reproduces DAMPE observations**, Han-Xiang Hu et.al., [2602.14196v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14196v1)

 We develop a self-consistent nonlinear extension of diffusive shock acceleration that incorporates cosmic ray (CR) backreaction on the shock precursor together with a physically motivated upstream-escape mechanism that produces an exponential high energy cutoff. The CR pressure gradient decelerates the upstream flow facing the shock wave, generating an extended precursor in which higher rigidity particles sample a larger cumulative velocity gradient and thereby acquire a progressively harder spectrum. Finite-size/escape effects are modeled by a momentum-dependent loss term, which naturally terminates acceleration and steepens the spectrum near the cutoff. The precursor compression ratio is not imposed as a closure condition but is determined dynamically by requiring consistency between the injection rate inferred from thermal leakage at the subshock and the injection strength demanded by the nonlinear shock modification, with CR-driven wave heating providing stabilizing negative feedback. Applying the model to young supernova-remnant-like parameters and standard one-zone Galactic diffusion, we reproduce the main features of the latest DAMPE proton spectrum: gradual hardening from hundreds of GeV to multi-TeV energies and a subsequent exponential cutoff at tens of TeV. The resulting spectral evolution follows directly from the competition between precursor-mediated nonlinear feedback and upstream escape.

 We present a parametric strong-lensing model for the galaxy cluster MACS J1931.8-2635 ($z\_l = 0.35$), accompanying the detection of the spectroscopically confirmed SN Eos at $z = 5.13$ (Coulter et al. 2026). We identify 10 new multiple-image systems in recent VENUS JWST/NIRCam imaging, so that the model is constrained with a total of 19 robust multiple-image systems -- nine of which also have a spectroscopic redshift. For the point-like source corresponding to SN Eos, our model predicts a total of five images, with the observed radial image pair having a similar magnification of $μ\simeq 25 - 30$ and a small time delay of $< 5$ days, in agreement with their simultaneous observation. According to the model, the other three predicted images arrived earlier, with time delays of $3.7 \pm 0.7$, $3.5 \pm 0.7$ and $54.0 \pm 10.8$ years prior to the two observed images, and with magnifications of $12.9 \pm 2.6$, $13.0 \pm 2.9$ and $2.2 \pm 0.4$, respectively. The absence of detections at the predicted positions, where the host galaxy's images are also visible, confirms the transient nature of the source. SN Eos and its host galaxy are studied in separate articles, and we here focus on the lens model. The final model reaches a very good $r.m.s.$ distance between model and observations of $0.44''$. We present the lens-modeling results, including newly identified systems such as a triply imaged, grand-design spiral galaxy candidate at $z \simeq 3.65\_{-0.09}^{+0.04}$, and briefly discuss the potential of using high-redshift lensed SNe for cosmography.
