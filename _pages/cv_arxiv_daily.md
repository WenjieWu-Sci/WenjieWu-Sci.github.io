2025-01-16, **Constraints on Cosmic Rays Acceleration in Bright Gamma-ray Bursts with Observations of Fermi**, Xing-Fu Zhang et.al., [2501.09594v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09594v1)

 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are widely suggested as potential sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). The kinetic energy of the jets dissipates, leading to the production of an enormous amount of $\gamma$-ray photons and possibly also the acceleration of protons. The accelerated protons will interact with the radiation of the GRB via the photomeson and Bethe-Heitler processes, which can initiate electromagnetic cascades. This process can give rise to broadband radiation up to the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray regime. The expected $\gamma$-ray flux from cascades depends on properties of the GRB jet, such as the dissipation radius $R\_{\rm diss}$, the bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$, and the baryon loading factor $\eta\_p$. Therefore, observations of Fermi-LAT can impose constraints on these important parameters. In this study, we select 12 GRBs of high keV-MeV fluence and constrain the baryon loading factor, under different combinations of the bulk Lorentz factor and the dissipation radius based on Fermi-LAT's measurements. Our findings indicate a strong constraint of $\eta\_p<10$ for most selected GRBs over a large parameter space except for large dissipation radii ($\gtrsim 10^{15}\rm cm$) and high bulk Lorentz factors ($\gtrsim 600$). The constraint is comparable to, and in some GRBs even stronger than, that from high-energy neutrinos for stacked GRBs. Our results suggest that for typical bulk Lorentz factor of several hundreds, the dissipation radii of GRBs need be large to avoid overshooting the GeV gamma-ray flux during the prompt emission phase of GRBs, which can be used to constrain GRBs.

2025-01-16, **Void spin distribution as a powerful probe of $Ïƒ_{8}$**, Geonwoo Kang et.al., [2501.09476v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09476v1)

 We present a numerical proof of the concept that the void spin distributions can in principle provide a tight constraint on the amplitude of matter density fluctuation on the scale of $8\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ ($\sigma\_{8}$) without being severely deteriorated by the degeneracies of $\sigma\_{8}$ with cold dark matter density parameter multiplied by the dimensionless Hubble parameter square ($\Omega\_{\rm cdm}h^{2}$), total neutrino mass ($M\_{\nu}$) and dark energy equation of state ($w$). Applying the Void-Finder algorithm to a total of $15$ AbacusSummit $N$-body simulations of $15$ different cosmological models, we identify the giant voids to measure their spins, defined as the magnitudes of rescaled specific angular momenta of void halos. The $15$ cosmologies include the Planck $\Lambda$CDM and $14$ non-Planck models, each of which differs among one another only in one of $\{\sigma\_{8},\ \Omega\_{\rm cdm}h^{2},\ M\_{\nu},\ w\}$. The probability density distribution of void spins is determined for each model and found to be well approximated by the generalized Gamma distribution with two characteristic parameters, $k$ and $\theta$. It turns out that the best-fit values of $k$ and $\theta$ exhibit very sensitive dependences only on $\sigma\_{8}$, being almost insensitive to $\Omega\_{\rm cdm}h^{2}$, $M\_{\nu}$, $w$. This exclusive $\sigma\_{8}$-dependence of the void spin distributions is confirmed to be robust against the variation of the mass and number cuts of void halos. We also test an observational feasibility of estimating the void spins from real data on the galaxy redshifts.

2025-01-16, **The flux of electron antineutrinos from supernova SN1987A data**, Riccardo Maria Bozza et.al., [2501.09445v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09445v1)

 By adopting a state-of-the-art parameterized model of electron antineutrino emission, we have made some steps forward in the analysis of the thermodynamical properties and temporal structure of neutrino emission from core collapse SN1987A. Our analysis, unlike similar previous ones, takes into account the times, energies and angles of arrival of the detected events in a reliable framework which includes a finite ramp in the initial stage of the neutrino emission. The existence of the accretion phase is confirmed with a confidence level of about 99%, and the neutrons involved in the emission during accretion, for the first time, do not show significant tensions with expectations, being about 0.02 $M\_\odot$. We determine the parameters of the cooling emission and discuss its duration, that compares well with theoretical expectations. We estimate the delay times between the first neutrino and the first event in the detectors. The goodness of fit checks, performed on the temporal, energy and angular distributions, show that the flux resulting from the best-fit analysis is compatible with the observed data.

2025-01-16, **Exploring the Neutrino Mass Hierarchy from Isotopic Ratios of Supernova Nucleosynthesis Products in Presolar Grains**, Xingqun Yao et.al., [2501.09329v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09329v1)

 We study the nucleosynthesis in a core-collapse supernova model including newly calculated neutrino-induced reaction rates with both collective and Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) neutrino-flavor oscillations considered. We show that the measurement of a pair of $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B and $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La or $^6$Li/$^7$Li and $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La in presolar grains that are inferred to have originated from core-collapse supernovae could constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy. The new shell-model and the model of quasi-particle random phase approximation in the estimate of three important neutrino-induced reactions, $\nu+^{16}$O, $\nu+^{20}$Ne, and $\nu+^{138}$Ba are applied in our reaction network. The new rates decrease the calculated $^{7}$Li/$^{6}$Li ratio by a factor of five compared with the previous study. More interestingly, these new rates result in a clear separation of the isotopic ratio of $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B between normal and inverted mass hierarchies in the O/Ne, O/C, and C/He layers where $^{138}$La abundance depends strongly on the mass hierarchy. In these layers, the sensitivity of the calculated abundances of $^{10,11}$B and $^{6,7}$Li to the nuclear reaction uncertainties is also tiny. Therefore, we propose that the $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B vs. $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La and $^6$Li/$^7$Li vs. $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La in type X silicon carbide grains sampled material from C/He layer can be used as a new probe to constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy.

2025-01-16, **Search for neutrino doublets and triplets using 11.4 years of IceCube data**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2501.09276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09276v1)

 We report a search for high-energy astrophysical neutrino multiplets, detections of multiple neutrino clusters in the same direction within 30 days, based on an analysis of 11.4 years of IceCube data. A new search method optimized for transient neutrino emission with a monthly time scale is employed, providing a higher sensitivity to neutrino fluxes. This result is sensitive to neutrino transient emission, reaching per-flavor flux of approximately $10^{-10}\ {\rm erg}\ {\rm cm}^{-2}\ {\rm sec}^{-1}$ from the Northern sky in the energy range $E\gtrsim 50$~TeV. The number of doublets and triplets identified in this search is compatible with the atmospheric background hypothesis, which leads us to set limits on the nature of neutrino transient sources with emission timescales of one month.

2025-01-16, **Constraining the Secluded and Catalyzed Annihilation Dark Matter with Fermi-LAT and Planck Data**, Yu-Hang Su et.al., [2501.09647v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09647v1)

 We propose a dark matter (DM) model with a complex scalar charged under a hidden gauge symmetry, denoted as $U(1)\_D$. The scalar field is the DM candidate while the $U(1)\_D$ gauge field $A'$ plays the role of a mediator, which connects the dark sector to the standard model (SM) sector via a tiny kinetic mixing. We find that both the secluded and catalyzed annihilation scenarios can be realized in this model. The phenomenology of DM, including relic density, indirect detection (Fermi-LAT), and CMB (Planck) constraints, is discussed. We also extend our discussion to DM with other spins, including Dirac fermion and vector boson. Our analysis is carried out in two models, denoted as $U(1)\_D \times U(1)\_Y$ and $U(1)\_D \times U(1)\_{L\_\mu-L\_\tau}$, with the former corresponding to $A'$ kinetically mixing with the $U(1)\_Y$ gauge field $B$ and the latter corresponding to $A'$ mixing with the $U(1)\_{L\_\mu-L\_\tau}$ gauge field $Z'$. We find that, in previous studies, the indirect detection limits were overly restrictive because they only considered the simplified $2\mathrm{DM} \to 2\mathrm{SM}$ annihilation channel. In contrast, by performing a complete calculation of the gamma-ray and CMB constraints from the process $2\mathrm{DM} \to 2A' \to 4\mathrm{SM}$ in the models we consider, we observe weaker constraints in both the $U(1)\_D \times U(1)\_Y$ and $U(1)\_D \times U(1)\_{L\_\mu-L\_\tau}$ models, with the $U(1)\_D \times U(1)\_{L\_\mu-L\_\tau}$ model being subject to the weakest constraints overall since it involves less hadronic decay processes.

2025-01-16, **Scattering meets absorption in dark matter detection**, Pieter Braat et.al., [2501.09642v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09642v1)

 Direct detection experiments have started to explore dark matter scattering off electrons and nucleons through light mediators. Mediators with sub-keV masses are efficiently produced in the Sun and can be absorbed in the same detectors that probe dark matter scattering. We investigate the interplay of dark matter scattering and mediator absorption for two models with a dark photon as mediator. For Dirac dark matter, we find that scattering and absorption can be simultaneously observed at direct detection experiments in the near future. For atomic dark matter, we predict additional signals due to scattering of both dark atoms and constituents from ionized dark atoms. In both models, we determine the parameter space that respects bounds from cosmology and astrophysics, where the strongest constraints come from dark matter self-interactions. In this way, we identify viable targets for dark matter with light mediators at upcoming direct detection experiments. Distinguishing between the various signals, for instance by measuring energy distributions, will be crucial to reveal the underlying model in case of a discovery.

2025-01-16, **Gravitational waves and dark matter with Witten effect**, Ruiyu Zhou et.al., [2501.09596v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09596v1)

 We investigate the breaking of dark $SU(2)\_d$ symmetry at different temperature scales, occurring after Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking or following QCD symmetry breaking. We focus on assessing the potential of the hidden monopoles generated during this process to serve as dark matter candidate. Additionally, we examine the impact of axion-monopole interactions on the axion mass. When the phase transition occurs at extremely high temperature ($\sim 10^8 \mathrm{GeV}$), the contribution of monopoles to the axion mass through witten effect becomes non-negligible, playing a crucial role in accurately determining the axion relic density. Moreover, the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by dark phase transition and axionic domain wall collapse may offer a potential explanation for the low-frequency gravitational wave signals observed in PTA experiments.

2025-01-16, **Velocity fields and turbulence from cosmic filaments to galaxy clusters**, ThÃ©o Lebeau et.al., [2501.09573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09573v1)

 Galaxy clusters are currently the endpoint of the hierarchical structure formation; they form via the accretion of dark matter and cosmic gas from their local environment. In particular, filaments contribute grandly by accreting gas from cosmic matter sheets and underdense regions and feeding it to the galaxy clusters. Along the way, the gas in filaments is shocked and heated, which, together with the velocity structure within the filament, induces swirling and, thus, turbulence. In this work, we study a constrained hydrodynamical simulation replica of the Virgo cluster to characterise the velocity field in the two cosmic filaments connected to the cluster with unprecedented high resolution. First, we conduct a qualitative examination of slices extracted from the simulation. We study the temperature, the velocity field, and derived quantities in longitudinal cuts to study the general structure of the filaments and in transverse cuts to study their inner organisation and connection to cosmic matter sheets and underdense regions. Then, we conduct a quantitative study of velocities in Virgo's filaments by computing the 2D energy spectrum from 1 and 5~Mpc square maps extracted from the slices and centred on the core of the filaments. We show that the velocity field goes from mostly compressive far in the filaments to mostly solenoidal in Virgo's core. Moreover, we observe that the total energy spectrum in the filaments gains in amplitude and steepens towards Virgo.

2025-01-16, **Observable Signatures of RN Black Holes with Dark Matter Halos via Strong Gravitational Lensing and Constraints from EHT Observations**, Niyaz Uddin Molla et.al., [2501.09439v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09439v1)

 We investigate the impact of dark matter halos on the gravitational lensing produced by electrically charged, spherically symmetric black holes in the strong-field regime. The study focuses on two dark matter models: the Universal Rotation Curve Model and the cold dark matter model. We derive the coefficients for the strong deflection limit and numerically analyze the deflection angle variations. Graphical representations of the results show that the strong deflection angle, $\alpha\_D$ , increases with the charge parameter $Q$ in the presence of a dark matter halo. We explore the astrophysical consequences for the supermassive black holes $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ , comparing the results with standard Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Schwarzschild black holes via strong gravitational lensing observations. Our findings suggest that charged black holes with dark matter halos can be differentiated from standard black holes. We constrain the charge parameter $Q$ using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. For $M87^*$ , we find $0 \leq \|Q\| \leq 0.366M$ with the Universal Rotation Curve model and $0 \leq \|Q\| \leq 0.364M$ with the cold dark matter model. For $SgrA^*$ , the constraints are $0 \leq \|Q\| \leq 0.586M$ and $0 \leq \|Q\| \leq 0.584M$, respectively. These results suggest that charged black holes with dark matter halos satisfy the Event Horizon Telescope constraints, offering potential for future identification in observational campaigns.

2025-01-16, **Probing Cosmology with 92 Localized Fast Radio Bursts and DESI BAO**, Yi-Ying Wang et.al., [2501.09260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09260v1)

 Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, combined with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) with $w\_0>-1$ and $w\_a<0$. Given the cosmological origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), the combination of their dispersion measures and host galaxy redshifts makes localized FRBs a valuable tool for probing cosmology. Using an updated sample of 92 localized FRBs, along with DESI BAO, PlantheonPlus and CMB data, we constrain the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) under the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We find that even without incorporating CMB data, DDE remains preferred with $w\_0 = -0.855 ^{+0.084}\_{-0.084}$ and $w\_a = -1.174^{+0.462}\_{-0.491}$ at a confidence level of $\sim2.5 \sigma$. A joint analysis constrains these to be $w\_0 = -0.784^{+0.064}\_{-0.064}$ and $w\_a = -0.872^{+0.269}\_{-0.278}$, showing a discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM at a $\sim3.1\sigma$ level. Furthermore, using localized FRBs alone, we estimate the Hubble constant $H\_0$ to be $69.04^{+2.30}\_{-2.07}$ and $75.61^{+2.23}\_{-2.07} \, \rm km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$, assuming the Galactic electron density models to be NE2001 (Cordes \& Lazio) and YMW16 (Yao et al.), respectively. Thus, accurate accounting of the Galactic dispersion measure is crucial for resolving the Hubble tension with FRBs. Future BAO measurements, next-generation CMB experiments, and more localized FRBs will further constrain the DE EoS and the cosmological parameters.
