2025-12-24, **Can Randomness lead to non-anarchical mixing angles ?**, Aadarsh Singh Sudhir K Vempati et.al., [2512.21202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21202v1)

 We revisit the proposal of Craig and Sutherland that Anderson localization in a disordered fermion theory space can generate small neutrino masses from TeV scale physics \citecraig2018exponential}. Building on this idea, we ask a broader question: can randomness in fermion mass parameters also give rise to nonanarchical neutrino mixing angles, and how does the answer depend on the geometry of the mass graph? To explore this, we analyse three representative geometries a nearest neighbour chain, a fully connected non local model, and the Petersen graph in both Dirac and Majorana neutrino realisations. In the regime of strong diagonal disorder, all geometries display robust localization and naturally generate the observed neutrino mass scale, with the corresponding flavour mixing angles reflecting the random localization centres and thus taking an anarchical form. In the regime of weak disorder, where localization is milder, and eigenmodes can exhibit quasidegeneracies, light neutrino masses can emerge through GIM-mechanismlike cancellations among the heavy states. The weak disorder with geometry dependent weak localization constitutes a distinct pathway to structured mixings within disordered theory spaces. Overall, our results delineate the regimes in which disorder driven mechanisms produce hierarchical masses and identify the conditions under which structured flavour mixing can arise.

2025-12-24, **Optimizing Sterile Neutrino Searches: Impact of Position Resolution in Short-Baseline Reactor Experiments**, Young Ju Ko et.al., [2512.20952v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20952v1)

 The impact of position resolution on the sensitivity of short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments searching for light sterile neutrinos is investigated. Detailed simulations are conducted to evaluate two detector configurations: a segmented detector and an opaque liquid scintillator (OLS) detector, each positioned at two candidate research reactor sites, HANARO and Kijang. For both detector types, pseudo-data are generated under realistic assumptions regarding neutrino flux, detector response, and background levels. Oscillation analyses are performed to estimate detector sensitivity, incorporating both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The results indicate that the OLS detector, owing to its superior position resolution, achieves leading sensitivity across a wide range of oscillation parameters, even under conservative experimental conditions. These findings underscore the potential of OLS technology as a highly effective approach for future sterile neutrino searches.

2025-12-24, **A novel realization of linear seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule with the assistance of $\mathbb Z_3$ symmetry**, Hiroshi Okada et.al., [2512.20891v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20891v1)

 We propose a novel realization of linear seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule with the assistance of $\mathbb Z\_3$ symmetry. In our framework, Dirac mass matrices are generated at one-loop level, dynamically breaking the non-invertible symmetry while the symmetry is invariant under the tree-level. In addition to the active neutrino masses, the model exhibits rich and testable phenomenology such as non-unitarity bound, lepton flavor violations, lepton anomalous magnetic moment, and dark matter candidate. After describing our model, we carry out numerical analysis and show some results for our physical parameters.

2025-12-24, **Search for Light Dark Matter in Rare Meson Decays**, Ze-Kun Liu et.al., [2512.21191v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21191v1)

 Current dark matter direct detection experiments have low sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter. In this work, we demonstrate that rare $B$ and $K$ meson decays with missing energy in the final state can serve as efficient probes in this mass range. We analyze a generic $Z^{\prime}$ portal dark matter model and derive upper limits on its parameters from experimental bounds on the rare $B$ and $K$ meson decays. Our results show that such meson decay processes provide complementary constraints to current direct detection experiments for sub-GeV dark matter, particularly for interaction forms mediated by dark matter momentum dependent operators.

2025-12-24, **Preliminary forecasting constraint on scalar charge with LISA in non-vacuum environments**, Tieguang Zi et.al., [2512.21186v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21186v1)

 We compute the gravitational wave signal from eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded within beyond-vacuum environments, where the secondary object carries a scalar charge and evolves in the presence of both an accretion disk and a dark matter halo. The waveform modification is derived by incorporating the scalar charge correcting the fluxes and orbital trajectories of the secondary. Our results indicate that, under suitable parameter configurations, the influence of the scalar charge on EMRIs waveform in such environments can be distinguished from that in vacuum spacetime. For the EMRIs signal modified by the astrophysical environments, the future space-borne detector can determine the relative error of scalar charge constrained by LISA at the level of $\sim0.1$, providing a preliminary prediction of detecting scalar charge in the beyond-vacuum spacetime.

2025-12-24, **The throttling refrigeration system for the large cooling power recovery of the PandaX-xT cryogenic distillation system for radon removal**, Shunyu Yao et.al., [2512.20947v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20947v1)

 In order to solve the continuous large cooling power supply problem (20 kW) for the radon-removal cryogenic distillation system, which operates at high liquid ffow rate of 856 kg/h (5 LPM) for the dark matter detector PandaX-xT of the next-generation, a throttling refrigeration system based on carbon tetraffuoride (R14) refrigerant for cooling power recovery is designed and developed. According to this system, the cooling power of the liquid xenon in the reboiler of 178K could be transferred to the product xenon cryostat to liquefy the gaseous product xenon by the R14 circulation, thus the liqueffed xenon could return to the detector with the same condition of which extracted from the detector to form a stable cooling cycle and prevent the instability of the detector. A research and development experiment is implemented to validate the feasibility of this large cooling recovery system, using the ethanol to simulate the liquid xenon. Experimental results show that the cooling power recovery of this system could achieve 17 kW with the efffciency of 76.5%, and the R14 ffow rate is 0.16 kg/s. This study realizes the online radon removal distillation with large ffow rate while eliminating the dependence of liquid nitrogen or cryocoolers, which means saving 2414 m3 liquid nitrogen per year or the power consumption of 230 kW. Furthermore, process simulation and optimization of the throttling refrigeration cycle is studied using Aspen Hysys to reveal the inffuences of the key parameters to the system, and the deviation between the simulation and experimental results is < 2.52%.

2025-12-24, **Spectroscopy of VUV luminescence in dual-phase xenon detectors**, K. C. Oliver-Mallory et.al., [2512.20935v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20935v1)

 We present spectroscopic measurements of xenon luminescence in a time projection chamber operated in a dual-phase (liquid-gas) configuration. Thorium-228 $α$ decays excited the liquid, resulting in the formation of singlet and triplet excimers that emit vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) scintillation. Ionisation electrons were drifted to the liquid surface and extracted into the vapour, where they produced VUV electroluminescence. A time-resolved photon-counting technique was used to obtain the scintillation spectrum in the liquid, which exhibited a peak wavelength of $177.1\pm0.1\_\mathrm{stat} \pm0.1\_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$ and a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $11.3\pm0.2\_\mathrm{stat} \pm0.0\_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$. The data were also used to obtain distinct singlet and triplet emission models, with the singlet emission peaking $1.8\pm0.3\_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm 0.3\_{\mathrm{sys}}\,\textrm{nm}$ shorter than the triplet. The gas electroluminescence spectrum was obtained simultaneously, while under conditions of thermal equilibrium. It remained consistent across vapour pressures of $1.3$-$2.2\,\textrm{bar}$, with a peak of $173.28\pm0.02\_\mathrm{stat} {\_{-0.1}^{+0.2}}{}\_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$, a FWHM of $10.59\pm0.03\_\mathrm{stat} {\_{-0.2}^{+0.0}}{}\_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$, and a small short-wavelength tail that constitutes $(0.6\pm0.1)$% of the total spectrum. These are the only spectroscopic measurements of liquid scintillation and gas electroluminescence acquired simultaneously to date, and the first such measurements of singlet and triplet emission in the liquid phase. They are important for precisely characterising dual-phase xenon detectors used to search for dark matter particle interactions and other rare events.

2025-12-24, **ZTF SN Ia DR2 follow-up: Characterization of subluminous Type Ia supernovae in the ZTF DR2 full sample**, Alaa Alburai et.al., [2512.21256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21256v1)

 The Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 2 (ZTF DR2) includes a total of 3,628 Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), providing the largest and most complete sample of spectroscopically confirmed SNe~Ia at low redshift to date. In this paper, we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 124 subluminous SNe~Ia, the largest sample of spectroscopically classified subluminous SNe~Ia observed with a single instrument, comprising 87 91bg-like, 12 86G-like, 18 04gs-like, and 7 02es-like events. We complement the published DR2 SALT2 light-curve parameters with new parameters obtained using template-based fits from SNooPy. Expansion velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths pEW of key spectral features are measured using Spextractor, and spectral averages are constructed for each subluminous subtype, binned by phase. We also analyze the host galaxy environments, both global and local, in terms of $g - z$ color, stellar mass, and directional light radius $d\_{DLR}$. We find that all subluminous SNe~Ia (except the 02es-like subtype) are intrinsically red. This is evident by separating extrinsic from intrinsic color components. Since SALT2 is not trained on subluminous SNe~Ia, it compensates for their redder colors by inflating the $c$ parameter, thus extending the luminosity-width relation to negative values of x1. As expected, all subluminous SNe~Ia fall within the Cool region of the Branch et al. (2006) diagram, with the exception of 02es-like events, which show lower Si II 5972 pEW values. All subluminous subtypes tend to occur in more massive, redder host galaxies, and in the reddest local environments. Notably, 91bg- and 86G-like SNe~Ia explode at significantly larger normalized galactocentric distances. Finally, we identify the $pEW$ of the blended Ti II+Si II+Mg II absorption feature at 4300~A, along with s\_BV, as robust and sufficient indicators for subclassifying subluminous SNe~Ia.

2025-12-24, **Considering lensing effect on gravitational wave signals from black holes in mass gap**, Qiyuan Yang et.al., [2512.20890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20890v1)

 The pair-instability supernova (PISN) mechanism predicts a mass gap in the black hole population, where no stellar-origin black holes are expected to form. However, the binary black hole merger events GW190521 and GW231123 appear unusual, as current analyses place their component masses within the PISN mass gap. In this work, we investigate the relationship between different lensing magnifications and the inferred source-frame black hole masses for these two events. If the gravitational wave source is lensed, neglecting lensing effect can bias the inferred luminosity distance and hence the redshift, leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance and consequently an overestimation of the source-frame masses, potentially placing them in the mass-gap region. For the two events in mass gap, when adopting a lower bound of $60 M\_{\odot}$ for the mass gap, the minimum magnifications required to shift the inferred source-frame masses below this gap boundary are found to be $μ=12.2$ for GW190521 and $μ=320.1$ for GW231123, corresponding to lensing-corrected luminosity distances of $11155\, \mathrm{Mpc}$ and $15207\, \mathrm{Mpc}$, respectively. These results provide a quantitative reference for assessing the lensing hypothesis as a possible explanation for the existence of black holes in the PISN mass gap.
