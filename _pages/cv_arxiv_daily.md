2024-05-21, **Impact of inhomogeneous diffusion on secondary cosmic ray and antiproton local spectra**, √Ålvaro Tovar-Pardo et.al., [2405.12918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12918v1)

 Recent $\gamma$-ray and neutrino observations seem to favor the consideration of non-uniform diffusion of cosmic rays (CRs) throughout the Galaxy. In this study, we investigate the consequences of spatially-dependent inhomogeneous propagation of CRs on the fluxes of secondary CRs and antiprotons detected at Earth. A comparison is made among different scenarios in search of potential features that may guide us toward favoring one over another in the near future. We also examine both the influence of inhomogeneous propagation in the production of secondary CRs from interactions with the gas, and the effects of this scenario on the local fluxes of antiprotons and light antinuclei produced as final products of dark matter annihilation. Our results indicate that the consideration of an inhomogeneous diffusion model could improve the compatibility of the predicted local antiproton flux with that of B, Be and Li, assuming only secondary origin of these particles. In addition, our model predicts a slightly harder local antiproton spectrum, making it more compatible with the high energy measurements of AMS-02. Finally, no significant changes are expected in the predicted local flux of antiprotons and antinuclei produced from dark matter among the different considered propagation scenarios.

2024-05-21, **Investigation of Electron Backscattering on Silicon Drift Detectors for the Sterile Neutrino Search with TRISTAN**, Daniela Spreng et.al., [2405.12776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12776v1)

 Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles in the minimal extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. They could be viable dark matter candidates if they have a mass in the keV range. The Karlsruhe tritium neutrino (KATRIN) experiment, extended with a silicon drift detector focal plane array (TRISTAN), has the potential to search for keV-scale sterile neutrinos by measuring the kinematics of the tritium $\beta$-decay. The collaboration targets a sensitivity of $10^{-6}$ on the mixing amplitude $\sin^2{\Theta}$. For this challenging target, a precise understanding of the detector response is necessary. In this work, we report on the characterization of electron backscattering from the detector surface, which is one of the main effects that influence the shape of the observed energy spectrum. Measurements were performed with a tandem silicon drift detector system and a custom-designed electron source. The measured detector response and backscattering probability are in good agreement with dedicated backscattering simulations using the Geant4 simulation toolkit.

2024-05-21, **Dimuons from neutrino-nucleus collisions in the semi-inclusive DIS approach**, Ilkka Helenius et.al., [2405.12677v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12677v1)

 We present a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation of dimuon production in neutrino-nucleus collisions. This process is typically calculated by assuming it to be proportional to inclusive charm production, which requires an effective acceptance correction to take the experimental cuts on the decay-muon kinematics into account. Here, we instead compute the dimuon production cross section directly as a convolution of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering to produce charmed hadrons, and a decay function fitted to $e^+e^-$ data to produce a muon from the charmed hadrons. The presented approach is in a good agreement with available experimental data and will serve as a starting point for higher-order QCD calculations without an external acceptance correction. The uncertainties arising from the decay function and scale dependence are sizeably smaller than those from the nuclear parton distribution functions. We also calculate the effective acceptances within our approach and compare them to those usually used in global fits of parton distribution functions, finding differences of the order of $10\,\%$, depending on the kinematics, perturbative order, and applied parton distributions.

2024-05-21, **First joint oscillation analysis of Super-Kamiokande atmospheric and T2K accelerator neutrino data**, Super-Kamiokande et.al., [2405.12488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12488v1)

 The Super-Kamiokande and T2K collaborations present a joint measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters from their atmospheric and beam neutrino data. It uses a common interaction model for events overlapping in neutrino energy and correlated detector systematic uncertainties between the two datasets, which are found to be compatible. Using 3244.4 days of atmospheric data and a beam exposure of $19.7(16.3) \times 10^{20}$ protons on target in (anti)neutrino mode, the analysis finds a 1.9$\sigma$ exclusion of CP-conservation (defined as $J\_{CP}=0$) and a preference for the normal mass ordering.

2024-05-20, **The Significance of Void Shape: Neutrino Mass from Voronoi Void-Halos?**, Adrian E. Bayer et.al., [2405.12302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12302v1)

 Massive neutrinos suppress the growth of cosmic structure on nonlinear scales, motivating the use of information beyond the power spectrum to tighten constraints on the neutrino mass, for example by considering cosmic voids. It was recently proposed that constraints on neutrino mass from the halo mass function (HMF) can be improved by considering only the halos that reside within voids -- the void-halo mass function (VHMF). We extend this analysis, which made spherical assumptions about the shape of voids, to take into account the non-spherical nature of voids as defined by the Voronoi-tessellation-based void finder, VIDE. In turn, after accounting for one spurious non-spherical void, we find no evidence that the VHMF contains information beyond the HMF. Given this finding, we then introduce a novel summary statistic by splitting halos according to the emptiness of their individual environments, defined by the Voronoi cell volume each halo resides in, and combining the mass functions from each split. We name the corresponding statistic the VorHMF and find that it could provide information regarding neutrino mass beyond the HMF. Our work thus motivates the importance of accounting for the full shape of voids in future analyses, both in terms of removing outliers to achieve robust results and as an additional source of cosmological information.

2024-05-20, **Left-Right model with radiative double seesaw mechanism**, Paulo Areyuna C. et.al., [2405.12283v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12283v1)

 We propose an extended Left-Right symmetric model with an additional global symmetry $U(1)\_X$, which after spontaneous symmetry breaking collapses to a residual subgroup $\mathbb{Z}\_2$, which guarantees that the light active neutrino masses are generated via a double seesaw mechanism at three loop level, with the Dirac submatrix arising at one loop. It also ensures one loop level masses for the SM charged fermions lighter than the top quark and protects Dark Matter (DM) candidates of the model. To the best of our knowledge our model has the first implementation of the radiative double seesaw mechanism with the Dirac submatrix generated at one loop level. We show that the model can successfully accommodate the observed pattern of SM fermion masses as well as mixing and is compatible with the constraints arising from the muon $g-2$ anomaly, neutrinoless double beta decay and DM.

2024-05-20, **DESI Dark Energy Time Evolution is Recovered by Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes**, Kevin S. Croker et.al., [2405.12282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12282v1)

 Recent results from baryon acoustic oscillation measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have found preliminary evidence that dark energy (DE) evolves with time, as parameterized by a $w\_0 w\_a$ equation of state. In this study, we point out that the DESI-preferred $w\_0w\_a$ models are recovered when a $w\_0w\_a$ model is fit to DE produced by baryon conversion in cosmologically coupled black holes (BHs). This recovery does not require any \emph{ad hoc} parameter adjustments; it solely depends on the independently measured cosmic star formation rate density. We discuss our result in the context of the missing baryon problem and the anomalously low sum of neutrino masses preferred by DESI. The global evolution of DE is an orthogonal probe of cosmological coupling, complementing constraints on BH mass growth from elliptical galaxies, stellar binaries, globular clusters, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA merging population, and X-ray binaries. A DE density that correlates with star formation is a natural outcome of cosmological coupling in BH populations.

2024-05-20, **Axion baryogenesis puts a new spin on the Hubble tension**, Raymond T. Co et.al., [2405.12268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12268v1)

 We show that a rotating axion field that makes a transition from a matter-like equation of state to a kination-like equation of state around the epoch of recombination can significantly ameliorate the Hubble tension, i.e., the discrepancy between the determinations of the present-day expansion rate $H\_0$ from observations of the cosmic microwave background on one hand and Type Ia supernovae on the other. We consider a specific, UV-complete model of such a rotating axion and find that it can relax the Hubble tension without exacerbating tensions in determinations of other cosmological parameters, in particular the amplitude of matter fluctuations $S\_8$. We subsequently demonstrate how this rotating axion model can also generate the baryon asymmetry of our universe, by introducing a coupling of the axion field to right-handed neutrinos. This baryogenesis model predicts heavy neutral leptons that are most naturally within reach of future lepton colliders, but in finely-tuned regions of parameter space may also be accessible at the high-luminosity LHC and the beam dump experiment SHiP.

2024-05-20, **Resonant Neutrino Flavor Conversion in the Atmosphere**, Connor Sponsler et.al., [2405.12140v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12140v1)

 Neutrinos produced in the atmosphere traverse a column density of air before being detected at neutrino observatories like IceCube or KM3NeT. In this work, we extend the neutrino flavor evolution in the {nuSQuIDS} code accounting for the varying height of neutrino production and the variable air density in the atmosphere. These effects can lead to sizeable spectral distortions in standard neutrino oscillations and are crucial to accurately describe some new physics scenarios. As an example, we study a model of quasi-sterile neutrinos that induce resonant flavor conversions at neutrino energies of ${O}(300)\text{ MeV}$ in matter densities of $1 \text{ g/cm}^3$. In atmospheric air densities, the same resonance is then realized at neutrino energies of ${O}(300- 700)$~GeV. We find that the new resonance can deplete the $\nu\_\mu + \overline{\nu}\_\mu$ flux at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory by as much as $10\%$ in the direction of the horizon.

2024-05-20, **Measurement of the absolute efficiency of the X-ARAPUCA photon detector for the DUNE Far Detector 1**, R. √Ålvarez-Garrote et.al., [2405.12014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12014v1)

 The Photon Detection System (PDS) of the first DUNE far detector (FD1) is composed of 6000 photon detection units, named X-ARAPUCA. The detection of the prompt light pulse generated by the particle energy release in liquid argon (LAr) will complement and boost the DUNE Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC). It will improve the non-beam events tagging and enable at low energies the trigger and the calorimetry of the supernova neutrinos. The X-ARAPUCA unit is an assembly of several components. Its Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) depends both on the design of the assembly, on the grade of the individual components and finally on their coupling. The X-ARAPUCA PDE is one of the leading parameters for the Photon Detection System sensitivity, that in turn determines the sensitivity of the DUNE for the detection of core-collapse supernova within the galaxy and for nucleon decay searches. In this work we present the final assessment of the absolute PDE of the FD1 X-ARAPUCA baseline design, measured in two laboratories with independent methods and setups. One hundred sixty units of these X-ARAPUCA devices have been deployed in the NP04 facility at the CERN Neutrino Platform, the 1:20 scale FD1 prototype, and will be operated during the year 2024. The assessed value of the PDE is a key parameter both in the NP04 and in the DUNE analysis and reconstruction studies.

2024-05-20, **Binary neutron star mergers as the source of the highest energy cosmic rays**, Glennys R. Farrar et.al., [2405.12004v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12004v1)

 We propose that ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are produced in binary neutron star mergers. Interpreting the highest energy events as r-process nuclei eliminates the need for exotic sources, while the observed near-universal maximum rigidity of ultrahigh energy sources can be understood as due to the uniformity of jets generated by the gravitationally-driven dynamo, given the narrow range of total binary neutron star masses. We discuss evidence for this scenario, and its prediction of coincidences between neutrinos above 10 PeV and gravitational waves.

2024-05-20, **Testing neutrino mass hierarchy under type-II seesaw scenario in $U(1)_X$ at colliders**, Arindam Das et.al., [2405.11820v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11820v1)

 The origin of tiny neutrino mass is a long standing unsolved puzzle of the Standard Model (SM) which allows us to consider scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) in a variety of ways. One of them being the gauge extension of the SM could be realized as in the form of an anomaly free, general $U(1)\_X$ extension of the SM where an $SU(2)\_L$ triplet scalar being charged under $U(1)\_X$ gauge group is introduced through a Dirac Yukawa coupling with the SM lepton doublet. Once the triplet scalar generates VEV, light neutrinos could acquire tiny Majorana mass and hence affecting the decay modes of the triplet scalar involving the neutrino oscillation data for different neutrino mass hierarchies. After the breaking of $U(1)\_X$ scenarios, a neutral BSM, neutral gauge boson $(Z^\prime)$ acquires mass which interact differently with the left and right handed fermions. Satisfying the recent LHC bounds on the triplet scalar and $Z^\prime$ production, we study the pair production of the triplet scalar at LHC, $e^-e^+$ and $\mu^-\mu^+$ colliders followed by its decay into dominant mode depending on the neutrino mass hierarchy. Generating the SM generic backgrounds, we study the possible signal significance of four lepton final states. We also compare our results with the purely SM gauge mediated triplet scalar pair production followed by four lepton final states which could be significant only in $\mu^- \mu^+$ collider.

2024-05-21, **Cosmic rays from annihilation of heavy dark matter particles**, E. V. Arbuzova et.al., [2405.12560v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12560v1)

 The origin of the ultra high energy cosmic rays via annihilation of heavy stable, fermions "f", of the cosmological dark matter (DM) is studied. The particles in question are supposed to be created by the scalaron decays in $R^2$ modified gravity. Novel part of our approach is the assumption that the mass of these carriers of DM is slightly below than a half of the scalaron mass. In such a case the phase space volume becomes tiny. It leads to sufficiently low probability of "f" production, so their average cosmological energy density could be equal to the observed energy density of dark matter. Several regions of the universe, where the annihilation could take place, are studied. They include the whole universe under assumption of homogeneous energy density, the high density DM clump in the galactic centre, the cloud of DM in the Galaxy with realistic density distribution, and high density clusters of DM in the Galaxy. Possible resonance annihilation of $f \bar f$ into energetic light particle is considered. We have shown that the proposed scenario can successfully explain the origin of the ultrahigh energy flux of cosmic rays where the canonical astrophysical mechanisms are not operative.

 A Planck scale inflationary era -- in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale -- produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.

2024-05-20, **In-situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window**, Haipeng An et.al., [2405.12285v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12285v1)

 Dark photon dark matter emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits established in the early universe.

2024-05-20, **Beyond the surface: hydrodynamical N-body simulations of the interacting dwarf galaxies NGC 5238 and UGC 8760**, R. Pascale et.al., [2405.12284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12284v1)

 From deep imaging data obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope as part of the Smallest Scale of Hierarchy Survey (SSH), we have discovered low-surface brightness tidal features around NGC 5238 and UGC 8760, two nearby and relatively isolated dwarf galaxies with stellar masses of approximately $10^8 M\_\odot$ and $2\times10^7 M\_\odot$, respectively. In this study, we present detailed hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations that explain the observed faint substructures as the outcome of interactions between the dwarf galaxies and smaller satellite systems. We show that the asymmetric stellar distribution of NGC 5238 and the low-luminosity substructures observed to the northeast of UGC 8760 can be well attributed to recent interactions with smaller galaxies, each with a stellar mass roughly a few $10^5 M\_\odot$, 50 times less massive than their respective hosts. In the simulations, these satellites have stellar and dark-matter masses consistent with the ones predicted by $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and share properties similar to those of local dwarf galaxies with similar stellar masses. The satellite-to-main galaxy mass ratio is approximately 1:10 in both cases. This satellite population aligns closely with predictions from cosmological simulations in terms of the number and mass relative to the host galaxy mass.

2024-05-20, **Cosmology of self-replicating universes in black holes formed by dark matter-seeded stellar collapse**, Joseph Bramante et.al., [2405.12277v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12277v1)

 We show that dark matter with certain minimal properties can convert the majority of baryons in galaxies to black holes over hundred trillion year timescales. We argue that this has implications for cosmologies which propose that new universes are created in black hole interiors. We focus on the paradigm of cosmological natural selection, which connects black hole production to a universe's likelihood for existing. Further, we propose that the universe's timescale for entropy production could be dynamically linked to black hole production in a naturally selected universe. Our universe would fit this scenario for models of particle dark matter that convert helium white dwarfs to black holes in around a hundred trillion years, where the dominant source of entropy in our universe are the helium white dwarfs' stellar progenitors, which cease forming and burning also in around a hundred trillion years. Much of this dark matter could be discovered at ongoing experiments.

2024-05-20, **Dark Branches of Immortal Stars at the Galactic Center**, Isabelle John et.al., [2405.12267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12267v1)

 We show that stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way can be significantly affected by dark matter annihilation, producing population-level effects that are visible in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. We establish the dark HR diagram, where stars lie on a new stable $\textit{dark main sequence}$ with similar luminosities, but lower temperatures, than the standard main sequence. The dark matter density in these stars continuously replenishes, granting these stars immortality and solving multiple stellar anomalies. Upcoming telescopes could detect the dark main sequence, offering a new dark matter discovery avenue.

2024-05-20, **CMB-HD as a Probe of Dark Matter on Sub-Galactic Scales**, Amanda MacInnis et.al., [2405.12220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12220v1)

 We show for the first time that high-resolution CMB lensing observations can probe structure on sub-galactic scales. In particular, a CMB-HD experiment can probe out to k ~ 55 h/Mpc, corresponding to halo masses of about $10^8 M\_{\odot}$. Over the range 0.005 h/Mpc < k < 55 h/Mpc, spanning four orders of magnitude, the total lensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the temperature, polarization, and lensing power spectra is greater than 1900. CMB-HD gains most of the lensing SNR at small scales from the temperature power spectrum, as opposed to the lensing spectrum. These lensing measurements allow CMB-HD to distinguish between cold dark matter (CDM) and non-CDM models that change the matter power spectrum on sub-galactic scales. We also find that CMB-HD can distinguish between baryonic feedback effects and non-CDM models due to the different way each impacts the lensing signal. The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) power spectrum further constrains non-CDM models that deviate from CDM on the smallest scales CMB-HD measures. For example, CMB-HD can detect 1 keV warm dark matter (WDM) at 30$\sigma$, or rule out about 7 keV WDM at 95% CL, in a $\Lambda$WDM + $N\_{\rm{eff}} + \sum m\_\nu + m\_{\rm{WDM}} + \log\_{10}T\_{\rm{AGN}} + A\_{\rm{kSZ}} + n\_{\rm{kSZ}}$ model; here $T\_{\rm{AGN}}$ characterizes the strength of the feedback, and $A\_{\rm{kSZ}}$ and $n\_{\rm{kSZ}}$ allow freedom in the amplitude and slope of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum. We make the CMB-HD Fisher code used here publicly available, and note that it can be modified to use any non-CDM model that changes the matter power spectrum.

2024-05-21, **Revisiting short-plateau SN 2018gj**, V. P. Utrobin et.al., [2405.12867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12867v1)

 We present an alternative model of unusual type-IIP SN 2018gj. Despite the short plateau and early gamma-rays escape seeming to favor low-mass ejecta, our hydrodynamic model requires a large ejected mass (about 23 Msun). The high ejecta velocity, we find from hydrogen lines in early spectra, is among crucial constraints on the hydrodynamic model. We recover the wind density that rules out a notable contribution of the circumstellar interaction to the bolometric luminosity. The early radioactive gamma-rays escape is found to be due to the high velocity of Ni-56, whereas the asymmetry of the H-alpha emission is attributed to the asymmetry of the Ni-56 ejecta. The available sample of type-IIP supernovae studied hydrodynamically in a uniform way indicates that the asymmetry of the Ni-56 ejecta is probably their intrinsic property. Hydrogen lines in the early spectra of SN 2018gi and SN 2020jfo are found to imply a clumpy structure of the outer ejecta. With two already known similar cases of SN 2008in and SN 2012A we speculate that the clumpiness of the outer ejecta is inherent to type-IIP supernovae related to the red supergiant explosion.

2024-05-21, **Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge with different stellar populations**, M. Molero et.al., [2405.12585v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12585v1)

 The metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the Galactic bulge features a multi-peak shape, with a metal-poor peak at [Fe/H]=-0.3 dex and a metal-rich peak at [Fe/H]=+0.3 dex. This bimodality is also seen in [alpha/Fe] versus [Fe/H] ratios, indicating different stellar populations in the bulge. We aim to replicate the observed MDF by proposing a scenario where the metal-poor bulge stars formed in situ during an intense star formation burst, while the metal-rich stars formed during a second burst and/or were accreted from the inner Galactic disk due to a growing bar. We used a chemical evolution model that tracks various chemical species with detailed nucleosynthesis, focusing on Fe production from both Type Ia supernovae and massive stars, including rotating massive stars with varying velocities. Our model also accounts for gas infall, outflow, and the effect of stellar migration. Results are compared to 13,000 stars from the SDSS/APOGEE survey within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic center. Our model successfully reproduces the double-peak shape of the bulge MDF and the alpha-element abundance trends relative to Fe by assuming (i) a multi-burst star formation history with a 250 Myr quenching of the first burst and (ii) stellar migration from the inner disk due to a growing bar. We estimate that about 40% of the bulge-bar's stellar mass originates from the inner disk. Nucleosynthesis models that assume either no rotation for massive stars or a rotational velocity distribution favoring slow rotation at high metallicities best match the observed MDF and [alpha/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance patterns.

2024-05-21, **SN 2019tua : A Type IIb Supernova with Multiple Bumps in the Light Curves**, Xin-Bo Huang et.al., [2405.12504v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12504v1)

 We present photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of the type IIb supernova (SN) SN 2019tua, which exhibits multiple bumps in its declining light curves between 40 and 65 days after discovery. SN 2019tua shows a time to peak of about 25 days similar to other type IIb SNe. Our observations indicate a decrease in its brightness of about 1 magnitude in the 60 days after the peak. At about days 50, and 60, its multiband light curves exhibit bumpy behavior. The complex luminosity evolution of SN 2019tua could not be well modeled with a single currently popular energy source model, e.g., radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, magnetar, interaction between the ejecta and a circumstellar shell. Even though the magnetar model has a smaller \( \chi^2 / \text{dof} \) value, the complex changes in SN 2019tua's brightness suggest that more than one physical process might be involved. We propose a hybrid CSM interaction plus $^{56}$Ni model to explain the bolometric light curve (LC) of SN 2019tua. The fitting results show that the ejecta mass $M\_{\rm ej} \approx 2.4~M\_\odot$, the total CSM mass $M\_{\rm CSM} \approx 1.0~M\_\odot$, and the $^{56}$Ni mass $M\_{\rm Ni} \approx 0.4~M\_\odot$. The total kinetic energy of the ejecta is $E\_k\approx 0.5 \times 10^{51}\rm~erg$. Pre-existing multiple shells suggest that the progenitor of SN 2019tua experienced mass ejections within approximately $\sim6 - 44$ years prior to the explosion.

2024-05-21, **Model independent calibration for sound horizon combining observations of supernovae and transversal BAO measurements**, Tonghua Liu et.al., [2405.12498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12498v1)

 The sound horizon is a key theoretical prediction of the cosmological model that depends on the speed of sound and the rate of expansion in the early universe, before matter and radiation decoupled. The standard ruler for low redshift calibration of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) is a direct measurement that would exist even if the standard cosmological model and the standard assumptions of early physics did not. We propose a new model-independent method to calibrate sound horizon $r^h\_s$ (relative standard ruler) by using the latest observations of SNe Ia and transversal BAO measurements. The final result reports $r\_s^{h}=107.10^{+1.36}\_{-1.32}$ $Mpc/h$ in the framework of the Pantheon dataset. This result changes to $r\_s^{h}=105.63^{+1.33}\_{-1.31}$ $Mpc/h$ when uses Pantheon+ dataset. Note that even without an estimate of dimensionless Hubble constant $h$, the combination of BAO and SNe Ia datasets already constrain the low-redshift standard ruler scale $r\_s^{h}$ at the $\sim1.26\%$ level. More importantly, it is interesting to find that most of the $r\_s^{h}$ obtained at high redshifts have a larger value (9 out of 15 results are larger than the result obtained by combining all BAOs). This finding may give us a better understanding of the discordance between the data sets or Hubble tension or reveal new physics beyond the standard model.

2024-05-20, **Improved model of the Supernova Refsdal cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 thanks to VLT/MUSE**, S. Schuldt et.al., [2405.12287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12287v1)

 We present new VLT/MUSE observations of the Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223, lensing the well-known supernova "Refsdal" into multiple images, which enabled the first cosmological applications with a strongly lensed supernova. Thanks to these data, targeting a northern region of the cluster and thus complementing our previous MUSE program on the cluster core, we release a new catalog containing 162 secure spectroscopic redshifts. We confirm 22 cluster members, which were previously only photometrically selected, and detect ten additional ones, resulting in a total of 308 secure members, of which 63% are spectroscopically confirmed. We further identify 17 new spectroscopic multiple images belonging to 6 different background sources. By exploiting MUSE data, in combination with the deep HFF images, we develop an improved total mass model of MACS J1149.5+2223. This model includes 308 total mass components for the member galaxies and requires four additional mass profiles, one of which is associated with a cluster galaxy overdensity identified in the North, representing the DM mass distribution on larger scales. The values of the resulting 34 free parameters are optimized based on the observed positions of 106 multiple images from 34 different families, that cover the redshift range between 1.240 and 5.983. Our final model has a multiple image position rms value of 0.39", which is well in agreement with that of other cluster lens models. With this refined mass model, we pave the way towards even better strong-lensing analyses that will exploit the deep and high resolution observations with HST and JWST on a pixel level in the region of the supernova Refsdal host. This will increase the number of observables by around two orders of magnitudes, thus offering us the opportunity of carrying out more precise and accurate cosmographic measurements.

 Two main mechanisms have classically been proposed for the formation of runaway stars. The binary supernova scenario (BSS) suggests that a massive star in a binary explodes as a supernova, ejecting its companion. The dynamical ejection scenario suggests that a star is ejected through a strong dynamical encounter between multiple stars. We propose a third mechanism for the formation of runaway stars: the sub-cluster ejection scenario (SCES), where an infalling sub-cluster of stars is ejected out of the cluster by a slingshot interaction with the contracting gravitational potential of the assembling cluster. We demonstrate the SCES in a star-by-star simulation of a young massive cluster forming from a $10^6\rm~M\_\odot$ gas cloud using the Torch framework. This star cluster forms hierarchically through a sequence of sub-cluster mergers, determined by the initial turbulent, spherical initial conditions of the gas. We find that these mergers drive the formation of runaway stars in our model. Late-forming sub-clusters fall into the central potential, where they are ejected on a slingshot trajectory, forming groups of runaway stars that are distributed highly anisotropically. Runaways formed by the same SCES share similar ages, velocities, and ejection directions. Surveying observations, we identify several SCES candidate groups with anisotropic ejection directions. The SCES is capable of producing runaway binaries: two wide dynamical binaries in infalling sub-clusters were tightened through ejection. This allows for another velocity kick via subsequent BSS, which is a promising avenue for producing hypervelocity stars unbound to the Galaxy. The SCES occurs when sub-cluster formation is resolved. We expect non-spherical initial gas distributions to increase runaway star numbers. The observation of groups of runaway stars formed via SCES thus reveals the assembly history of their natal clusters.

2024-05-20, **Revisiting the Tertiary-induced Binary Black Hole Mergers: the Role of Superthermal Wide Tertiary Eccentricity Distributions**, Yubo Su et.al., [2405.12270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12270v1)

 Recent studies show that the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries (semimajor axis $\gtrsim10^3\;\mathrm{AU}$) observed by \emph{Gaia} tends to favor large eccentricities more strongly than the canonical thermal distribution ($P(e) \propto e$) -- such distributions are termed ``superthermal''. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the formation channel of black hole (BH) binary mergers in triple stellar systems and study the impact of superthermal eccentricity distributions in the outer binaries. We explore the persistence of the highly eccentric outer orbits after each component in a stellar triple has undergone mass loss due to supernova explosions. We find that the outer eccentricity distribution can remain significantly superthermal for modestly hierarchical BH triples satisfying $a\_{\rm in}/a\_{\rm out}\gtrsim 0.005$ (where $a\_{\rm in}$ and $a\_{\rm out}$ are the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits), and are otherwise shaped by mass-loss induced kicks and dynamical instability. We then study the impact of these different outer eccentricity distributions of the remaining BH triples on mergers via the tertiary-induced channel. Of interest, we find that mergers can sometimes be produced even when the initial stellar orbits are near alignment (not subject to the von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effect; ZLK effect) as long as the system is sufficiently hierarchical. On the other hand, although the impact of the octupole-order ZLK effect is much greater when the outer binary is more eccentric, we find that the merger fraction only changes modestly for extreme outer eccentricity distributions, as the largest eccentricities tend to lead to dynamical instability.

 The sensitivity of the MeerKAT radio interferometer is an opportunity to probe deeper into the population of rare and faint extragalactic pulsars. The TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with MeerKAT) collaboration has conducted a radio-domain search for accelerated pulsars and transients in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). This partially targeted survey, performed at L-band (856-1712 MHz) with the core array of the MeerKAT telescope in 2-h integrations, is twice as sensitive as the latest SMC radio pulsar survey. We report the discovery of seven new SMC pulsars, doubling this galaxy's radio pulsar population and increasing the total extragalactic population by nearly a quarter. We also carried out a search for accelerated millisecond pulsars in the SMC Globular Cluster NGC 121 using the full array of MeerKAT. This improved the previous upper limit on pulsed radio emission from this cluster by a factor of six. Our discoveries reveal the first radio pulsar-PWN systems in the SMC, with only one such system previously known outside our galaxy (the "Crab pulsar twin" in the Large Magellanic Cloud, PSR J0540$-$6919). We associate the 59 ms pulsar discovery PSR J0040$-$7337, now the fastest spinning radio pulsar in the SMC, with the bow-shock Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) of Supernova Remnant DEM S5. We also present a new young pulsar with a 79 ms period, PSR J0048$-$7317, in a PWN recently discovered in a MeerKAT radio continuum image. Using the multi-beam capability of MeerKAT, we localised our pulsar discoveries, and two previous Murriyang discoveries, to a positional uncertainty of a few arcseconds.

 We present the description and initial results of the TRAPUM (TRAnsients And PUlsars with MeerKAT) search for pulsars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs), pulsar wind nebulae and unidentified TeV emission. The list of sources to be targeted includes a large number of well-known candidate pulsar locations but also new candidate SNRs identified using a range of criteria. Using the 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope, we use an interferometric beamforming technique to tile the potential pulsar locations with coherent beams which we search for radio pulsations, above a signal-to-noise of 9, down to an average flux density upper limit of 30 $\mu$Jy. This limit is target-dependent due to the contribution of the sky and nebula to the system temperature. Coherent beams are arranged to overlap at their 50 per cent power radius, so the sensitivity to pulsars is not degraded by more than this amount, though realistically averages around 65 per cent if every location in the beam is considered. We report the discovery of two new pulsars; PSR J1831$-$0941 is an adolescent pulsar likely to be the plerionic engine of the candidate PWN G20.0+0.0, and PSR J1818$-$1502 appears to be an old and faint pulsar that we serendipitously discovered near the centre of a SNR already hosting a compact central object. The survey holds importance for better understanding of neutron star birth rates and the energetics of young pulsars.

 Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) is one of the important standard ruler in cosmology. The results of the latest BAO measurements by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey has been reported. Cosmology with the varying electron mass model and the early dark energy (EDE) models are regraded as interesting models to resolve the Hubble tension. We present constraints on the varying electron mass model and EDE models by including new DESI data as well as cosmic microwave background by Planck and the conventional BAO data from 6dF, MGS, and DR12 and supernovae light curve data into analysis. Since new DESI BAO data indicates slightly longer sound horizon $r\_dh$ than the other BAO observations, for the varying electron mass model, the larger $H\_0 =69.44\pm 0.84 $ km$/$s$/$Mpc is indicated.

2024-05-20, **Growth of cosmic perturbations in the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity**, Mahnaz Asghari et.al., [2405.11840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11840v1)

 We explore the generalized $f(R,T)$ modified theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We derive modified field equations to the linear order of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ model. We then investigate the growth of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. Primary numerical investigations based on matter power spectra diagrams indicates a structure growth suppression in $f(R,T)$ gravity, which exhibits consistency with local measurements. Also, we notice that matter-geometry interaction in $f(R,T)$ model would results in the specific feature named as "matter acoustic oscillations" appeared in matter power spectra diagrams. Moreover, we put constraints on the cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$ model, utilizing current observations, chiefly cosmic microwave background (CMB), weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and redshift-space distortions (RSD) data. Numerical results based on MCMC calculations imply that $f(R,T)$ is a qualified theory of modified gravity in reconciling Planck CMB data with local probes of large scale structures, by reporting lower values for the structure growth parameter $\sigma\_8$ compared to the standard model of cosmology.

2024-05-20, **The Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Reverberation Mapping Project: Initial Results for a candidate IMBH in a nearby Seyfert 1 Galaxy**, Wenwen Zuo et.al., [2405.11750v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11750v1)

 To investigate the short-term variability and determine the size of the optical continuum emitting size of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), we carried out high-cadence, multi-band photometric monitoring of a Seyfert 1 galaxy J0249-0815 across two nights, together with a one-night single-band preliminary test. The presence of the broad Ha component in our target was confirmed by recent Palomar/P200 spectroscopic observations, 23 years after Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ruling out the supernovae origin of the broad Ha line. The photometric experiment was primarily conducted utilizing four-channel imagers MuSCAT 3 & 4 mounted on 2-meter telescopes within the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Despite the expectation of variability, we observed no significant variation (<1.4%) on timescales of 6-10 hours. This non-detection is likely due to substantial host galaxy light diluting the subtle AGN variability. Dual-band preliminary tests and tailored simulations may enhance the possibility of detecting variability and lag in future IMBH reverberation campaigns.
