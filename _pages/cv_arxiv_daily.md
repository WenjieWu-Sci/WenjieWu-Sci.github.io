2023-04-06, **Mitigating Green's function Monte Carlo signal-to-noise problems using contour deformations**, Gurtej Kanwar et.al., [2304.03229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03229v1)

 The Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) method provides accurate solutions to the nuclear many-body problem and predicts properties of light nuclei starting from realistic two- and three-body interactions. Controlling the GFMC fermion-sign problem is crucial, as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases exponentially with Euclidean time, requiring significant computing resources. Inspired by similar scenarios in lattice quantum field theory and spin systems, in this work, we employ integration contour deformations to improve the GFMC signal-to-noise ratio. Machine learning techniques are used to select optimal contours with minimal variance from parameterized families of deformations. As a proof of principle, we consider the deuteron binding energies and Euclidean density response functions. We only observe mild signal-to-noise improvement for the binding energy case. On the other hand, we achieve an order of magnitude reduction of the variance for Euclidean density response functions, paving the way for computing electron- and neutrino-nucleus cross-sections of larger nuclei.

2023-04-06, **Right-Handed Neutrino Dark Matter with Forbidden Annihilation**, Yu Cheng et.al., [2304.02997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02997v1)

 The seesaw mechanism with three right-handed neutrinos has one as a well-motivated dark matter candidate if stable and the other two can explain baryon asymmetry via the thermal leptogenesis scenario. We explore the possibility of introducing additional particles to make the right-handed neutrino dark matter in thermal equilibrium and freeze out through a forbidden annihilation channel. Nowadays in the Universe, this forbidden channel can be reactivated by a strong gravitational potential such as the supermassive black hole in our galaxy center. The Fermi-LAT gamma ray data and dark matter relic density require this right-handed neutrino dark matter to have mass below $100\,$GeV and the existence of an additional boson $\phi$ that can be tested at future lepton colliders.

2023-04-05, **The indication for $^{40}$K geo-antineutrino flux with Borexino phase-III data**, L. B. Bezrukov et.al., [2304.02747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02747v1)

 We provide the indication of high flux of $^{40}$K geo-antineutrino and geo-neutrino ($^{40}$K-geo-($\bar{\nu} + \nu$)) with Borexino Phase III data. This result was obtained by introducing a new source of single events, namely $^{40}$K-geo-($\bar{\nu} + \nu$) scattering on electrons, in multivariate fit analysis of Borexino Phase III data. Simultaneously we obtained the count rates of events from $^7$Be, $pep$ and CNO solar neutrinos. These count rates are consistent with the prediction of the Low metallicity Sun model SSM B16-AGSS09. MC pseudo-experiments showed that the case of High metallicity Sun and absence of $^{40}$K-geo-($\bar{\nu} + \nu$) can not imitate the result of multivariate fit analysis of Borexino Phase III data with introducing $^{40}$K-geo-($\bar{\nu} + \nu$) events. We also provide arguments for the high abundance of potassium in the Earth.

2023-04-05, **Primordial Black Hole Leptogenesis in Supersymmetry**, Suhail Khan et.al., [2304.02604v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02604v1)

 We have studied the role of Hawking evaporation of primordial black hole in the production of the supersymmetric particles like sneutrinos - the super-partner of heavy right handed neutrinos. Considering lepton number violating decays of such particles and $CP$ violating phases due to soft supersymmetry breaking terms, we have obtained the baryonic asymmetry of the universe which depends on the mass of primordial black holes. Apart from CMB and BBN constraints on such mass, we have shown more stringent upper bound on this mass from the requirement of black hole evaporation temperature to be above the temperature required for almost first order phase transition so that leptogenesis could create the observed baryonic asymmetry. We have shown how the primordial black hole mass, heavy right handed neutrino mass and soft supersymmetry breaking parameters are related from the requirement of successful leptogenesis and the allowed parameter space to avoid gravitino problem. Considering experimental constraint on branching ratio of $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma $, we have shown the connection of right handed neutrino mass scale with the lower bound of the typical mass scale of supersymmetric particles.

2023-04-05, **Robust and efficient CMB lensing power spectrum from polarization surveys**, Louis Legrand et.al., [2304.02584v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02584v1)

 Deep surveys of the CMB polarization have more information on the lensing signal than the quadratic estimators (QE) can capture. We showed in a recent work that a CMB lensing power spectrum built from a single optimized CMB lensing mass map, working in close analogy to state-of-the-art QE techniques, can result in an essentially optimal spectrum estimator at reasonable numerical cost. We extend this analysis here to account for real-life non-idealities including masking and realistic instrumental noise maps. As in the QE case, it is necessary to include small corrections to account for the estimator response to these anisotropies, which we demonstrate can be estimated easily from simulations. The realization-dependent debiasing of the spectrum remains robust, allowing unbiased recovery of the band powers even in cases where the statistical model used for the lensing map reconstruction is grossly wrong. This allows now robust and at the same time optimal CMB lensing constraints from CMB data, on all scales relevant for the inference of the neutrino mass, or other parameters of our cosmological model.

2023-04-05, **Testing generalized neutrino interactions with PTOLEMY**, Indra Kumar Banerjee et.al., [2304.02505v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02505v1)

 There are several unanswered questions regarding neutrinos which pave the way for physics beyond the standard model (SM) of particle physics. Generalized interactions of neutrinos provide a way to characterize these effects in a manner which is even more general than the oft-studied non-standard neutrino interactions. These interactions are described by higher dimensional operators maintaining the SM gauge symmetries. On the other hand cosmic neutrino background, although yet to be detected directly, is a robust prediction of the SM and the standard cosmology. We perform a global analysis of the relevant generalized neutrino interactions which are expressly relevant for the proposed cosmic neutrino detector PTOLEMY. The electron spectrum due to the capture of cosmic neutrinos on radioactive tritium gets modified due to the presence of these generalized interactions. We also show how the differential electron spectrum is sensitive to the finite experimental resolution, mass of the lightest neutrino eigenstate, the strength of these interactions and the ordering of neutrino mass.

2023-04-05, **Quantum mismatch: a powerful measure of "quantumness" in neutrino oscillations**, Dibya S. Chattopadhyay et.al., [2304.02475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02475v1)

 The quantum nature of neutrino oscillations would be reflected in the mismatch between the neutrino survival probabilities with and without an intermediate observation. We propose this ``quantum mismatch'' as a measure of quantumness in neutrino oscillations, which precisely extracts the interference term in the two-flavor limit. In the full three-flavor scenario, we provide modified definitions of the Leggett-Garg and quantum mismatch measures. These are applicable for long-baseline and reactor neutrino experiments that measure neutrino survival probabilities with negligible matter effects.

2023-04-05, **Gravitational echoes of lepton number symmetry breaking with light and ultralight Majorons**, Andrea Addazi et.al., [2304.02399v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02399v1)

 We formulate a version of the low-scale Majoron model equipped with an inverse seesaw mechanism featuring lepton-number preserving dimension-6 operators in the scalar potential. Contrary to its dimension-4 counterpart, we find that the model can simultaneously provide light and ultralight Majorons, neutrino masses and their mixing, while featuring strong first-order cosmological phase transitions associated to the spontaneous breaking of the lepton number and the electroweak symmetries in the early Universe. We show by a detailed numerical analysis that under certain conditions on the parameter space accounted for in collider physics, the model can be probed via the primordial gravitational wave spectrum potentially observable at LISA and other planned facilities.

2023-04-06, **Searching for Primordial Black Holes with the Einstein Telescope: impact of design and systematics**, G. Franciolini et.al., [2304.03160v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03160v1)

 Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) have recently attracted much attention as they may explain some of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observations and significantly contribute to the dark matter in our universe. The next generation of Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors will have the unique opportunity to set stringent bounds on this putative population of objects. Focusing on the Einstein Telescope (ET), in this paper we analyse in detail the impact of systematics and different detector designs on our future capability of observing key quantities that would allow us to discover and/or constrain a population of PBH mergers. We also perform a population analysis, with a mass and redshift distribution compatible with the current observational bounds. Our results indicate that ET alone can reach an exquisite level of accuracy on the key observables considered, as well as detect up to tens of thousands of PBH binaries per year, but for some key signatures (in particular high--redshift sources) the cryogenic instrument optimised for low frequencies turns out to be crucial, both for the number of observations and the error on the parameters reconstruction. As far as the detector geometry is concerned, we find that a network consisting of two separated L--shaped interferometers of 15 (20)~km arm length, oriented at $45^{\circ}$ with respect to each other performs better than a single triangular shaped instrument of 10 (15)~km arm length, for all the metrics considered.

2023-04-06, **Minihalos as probes of the inflationary spectrum: accurate boost factor calculation and new CMB constraints**, Guillermo Franco Abellán et.al., [2304.02996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02996v1)

 Although the spectrum of primordial fluctuations has been accurately measured on scales above $\sim 0.1~\rm{Mpc}$, only upper limits exist on smaller scales. In this study, we investigate generic monochromatic enhancements to the $\Lambda$CDM spectrum that trigger the collapse of ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs) well before standard structure formation. We refine previous treatments by considering a mixed population of halos with different density profiles, that should realistically arise as a consequence of late-time accretion and mergers. Assuming that dark matter (DM) can self-annihilate, we find, as expected, that UCMHs can greatly enhance the annihilation rate around recombination, significantly imprinting the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. However, we provide additional insight on the theoretical uncertainties that currently impact that boost and which may affect late-time probes such as the 21 cm line or $\gamma$-ray signals. We derive constraints on the primordial power spectrum on small scales using the ExoCLASS/HYREC codes and the Planck legacy data. We account for the velocity dependence of the DM annihilation cross-section ($s$- or $p$-wave), annihilation channel, the DM particle mass and the inclusion of late-time halo mergers. Our $s$-wave constraints are competitive with previous literature, excluding primordial amplitudes $A\_{\star} \gtrsim 10^{-6.5}$ at wavenumbers $k \sim 10^4-10^7 \ \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. For the first time, we highlight that even $p$-wave processes have constraining power on the primordial spectrum for cross-sections still allowed by currently the strongest astrophysical constraints. Finally, we provide an up-to-date compilation of the most stringent limits on the primordial power spectrum across a wide range of scales.

2023-04-06, **Phase-space analysis of a novel cosmological model in $f(Q)$ theory**, Hamid Shabani et.al., [2304.02949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02949v1)

 The coincident gauges have been used solely while adopting the modified $f(Q)$ gravity theory to the cosmology. Consequently, researchers could not get beyond what is already known in $f(T)$ theory earlier. To alleviate this problem, in the present manuscript we investigate a novel construction of $f(Q)$ theory using non-vanishing affine connection in the spatially flat FLRW spacetime. We then investigate the cosmological solutions of $f(Q)$ theory for a perfect fluid through the phase space analysis. We introduce few variables and dimensionless parameters to construct the corresponding equations suitable for the dynamical system approach. The conservation of the energy-momentum tensor leads to a constraint equation that relates the dynamical variables. Briefly, there is a stable de Sitter solution which appears as either a point or a curve of equilibrium in the phase space. Also, unstable points corresponding to the matter dominated and radiation dominated eras have been found which do exist for every $f(Q)$ function. As a result, the present discussion shows that $f(Q)$ gravity endowed by non-vanishing affine connections is capable of explaining a true radiation-dark matter-accelerated expansion sequence.

2023-04-06, **Non-thermal Dark Matter via Lepton Portal: Hubble Tension and Stellar Cooling**, Zixuan Xu et.al., [2304.02904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02904v1)

 We propose a new non-thermal dark matter which feebly couples to the standard model charged leptons.The feeble interactions allow it $(1)$ to freeze-in from standard model thermal bath with its relic density being a partial or a whole of the observed dark matter density and $(2)$ to radiatively decay to two photons in the dark matter mass ranges of order keV scale with lifetime larger than the age of Universe.These features make this non-thermal dark matter a realistic realization of dark matter with late-time decay as a solution to Hubble tension.We show that the $68\%$ CL best fit value of $H\_{0}=68.3~(69.6)$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ compared to CMB+BAO (+LSS) data sets.We then use complimentary stellar cooling data to place stringent constraints on the parameter space.While the universal coupling scenario is excluded, the hierarchical coupling scenario can be tested by future observations on white dwarfs after a careful look into photon annihilation, Primakoff and Bremsstrahlung emission of the dark matter in various stellar systems.The viable parameter space may be linked to anomalies in future X-ray telescopes.

2023-04-05, **A Quantum Perspective on Oscillation Frequencies in Axion Dark Matter Experiments**, Joerg Jaeckel et.al., [2304.02523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02523v1)

 In this note we look at the time evolution of signals in axion dark matter experiments from a quantum perspective. Our aim is not to contribute new results to the general discussion of the quantum/classical connection (which we do not) but rather to slightly illuminate the specific case of axion experiments. From the classical perspective one expects a signal oscillating with a frequency equal to the axion mass whose amplitude is slowly rising due to the tiny interaction of the axions with ordinary matter. In the quantum picture the latter, slow time-scale arises from the small splitting in the energy levels induced by the interaction between the axions and the experiment, and it is always present in suitable, sensitive experiments. Signals that oscillate with a frequency equal to the axion mass, however, arise from processes changing the axion number. Yet, depending on the chosen observable, such oscillations may be absent for certain special initial quantum states of the axions. However, we show by example that, using an appropriate experimental procedure, these special states can be modified by the experiment in such a way that a signal oscillating with the axion mass re-appears. In addition, we discuss the measurement of suitable correlators that feature an oscillation with the axion mass. We also comment on the connection to the classical treatment. The explicit experiment we look at is an oscillating EDM experiment such as CASPEr but we expect our results to be easily adaptable to other types of axion dark matter experiments.

2023-04-05, **Gravitational waves from cosmic strings associated with pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter**, Ze-Yu Qiu et.al., [2304.02506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02506v1)

 We study stochastic gravitational waves from cosmic strings generated in an ultraviolet-complete model for pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter with a hidden $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge symmetry. The dark matter candidate in this model can naturally evade direct detection bounds and easily satisfy other phenomenological constraints. The bound on the dark matter lifetime implies an ultraviolet scale higher than $10^9~\mathrm{GeV}$. The spontaneous $\mathrm{U(1)}$ symmetry breaking at such a high scale would induce cosmic strings with high tension, resulting in a stochastic gravitational wave background with a high energy density. We investigate the constraints from current gravitational wave experiments as well as the future sensitivity. We find that most of the viable parameter points could be well studied in future gravitational wave experiments.

2023-04-05, **Anisotropic Hubble Expansion in Pantheon+ Supernovae**, Ruairí McConville et.al., [2304.02718v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02718v1)

 We decompose the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) sample in hemispheres on the sky finding angular variations up to $4$ km/s/Mpc in the Hubble constant $H\_0$ both in the SH0ES redshift range $0.0233 < z < 0.15$ and in the extended redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.7$. We assume the $\Lambda$CDM model, so our findings become model dependent in extended redshift ranges. $H\_0$ is larger in a hemisphere encompassing the CMB dipole direction. The variations we see exceed the errors on the recent SH0ES determination, $H\_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04$ km/s/Mpc, but are not large enough to explain early versus late Universe discrepancies in the Hubble constant. The removal of low redshift SN leads to a weakening of angular $H\_0$ variations, but we confirm that they persist beyond the influence of the Shapley supercluster $z > 0.06$

2023-04-05, **Exploring the Observability of Surviving Companions of Stripped-Envelope Supernovae: A Case Study of Type Ic SN 2020oi**, Hsin-Pei Chen et.al., [2304.02662v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02662v1)

 Stripped-envelope supernovae (SE SNe) were considered as the explosions of single massive stars with strong stellar winds, while later observations favor binary origins. One direct evidence to support the binary origins is to find the surviving companions of SE SNe since previous numerical studies suggested that the binary companion should survive the supernova impact and could be detectable. Recently, Gagliano et al. (2022) reported that the nearby Type Ic SN 2020oi in M100 (~17.1 Mpc) resulted from a binary system based on the HST photometric and spectroscopic observation. Based on the suggested binary properties of SN 2020oi, we conduct two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations of supernova-companion interactions and the subsequent post-impact evolution of the companion. Our results suggest that a surviving companion becomes brighter in two orders of magnitude and temporarily redder after the SN impact. The companion might be detectable with the JWST NIRCam short wavelength channel in a few years. Furthermore, the predicted magnitudes of surviving companions show a significant magnitude gradient around the peak. This could be another indicator to identify the surviving companion from a SE SN.

2023-04-05, **Searching for ejected supernova companions in the era of precise proper motion and radial velocity measurements**, A. A. Chrimes et.al., [2304.02542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02542v1)

 The majority of massive stars are born in binaries, and most unbind upon the first supernova. With precise proper motion surveys such as Gaia, it is possible to trace back the motion of stars in the vicinity of young remnants to search for ejected companions. Establishing the fraction of remnants with an ejected companion, and the photometric and kinematic properties of these stars, offers unique insight into supernova progenitor systems. In this paper, we employ binary population synthesis to produce kinematic and photometric predictions for ejected secondary stars. We demonstrate that the unbound neutron star velocity distribution from supernovae in binaries closely traces the input kicks. Therefore, the observed distribution of neutron star velocities should be representative of their natal kicks. We evaluate the probability for any given filter, magnitude limit, minimum measurable proper motion (as a function of magnitude), temporal baseline, distance and extinction that an unbound companion can be associated with a remnant. We compare our predictions with results from previous companion searches, and demonstrate that the current sample of stars ejected by the supernova of their companion can be increased by a factor of 5-10 with Gaia data release 3. Further progress in this area is achievable by leveraging the absolute astrometric precision of Gaia, and by obtaining multiple epochs of deep, high resolution near-infrared imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST and next-generation wide-field near-infrared observatories such as Euclid or the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.
