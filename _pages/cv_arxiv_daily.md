2025-09-22, **Cosmic inventory of the background fields of relativistic particles in the Universe**, Jonathan Biteau et.al., [2509.17954v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17954v1)

 The extragalactic background is composed of the emission from all astrophysical sources, both resolved and unresolved, in addition to any diffuse components. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the cosmic history of extragalactic emissions associated with stellar evolution and accretion onto supermassive black holes, largely enabled by the extensive body of multi-wavelength data. The brightness of the extragalactic sky is now measured in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, using observatories on the ground, in the sea, and in the ice, satellites in Earth orbit, and probes at the edge of the solar system. This wealth of disparate data is essential to unraveling the mysteries of the source populations that contribute to the extragalactic background.   In this contribution, we present an open database containing the most comprehensive collection of measurements of the extragalactic background spectrum to date. The combination of multi-messenger measurements over 27 frequency decades allows us to estimate the energy density of most extragalactic background components with an uncertainty of less than 30%. We explore the consistency of this cosmic inventory of the observed fields of relativistic particles populating the Universe with the cosmic history of star formation and accretion around supermassive black holes. Models incorporating these cosmic histories, as well as the redshift-dependent luminosity functions of extragalactic sources, currently match the electromagnetic component of the extragalactic background spectrum over 14 frequency decades, from the near UV to sub-TeV gamma rays. The knowledge gained from synthetic population models in the electromagnetic bands may become a crucial tool for understanding the origin of the most energetic extragalactic messengers, neutrinos and ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.

2025-09-22, **Improving Neutrino-Nuclei Interaction Models: Recommendations and Case Studies on Peelle's Pertinent Puzzle**, S. Abe et.al., [2509.17945v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17945v1)

 Improving the modeling of neutrino-nuclei interactions using data-driven methods is crucial for high-precision neutrino oscillation experiments. This paper investigates Peelle's Pertinent Puzzle (PPP) in the context of neutrino measurements, a longstanding challenge to fitting theoretical models to experimental data. Inconsistencies in data-model comparisons hinder efforts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of model predictions. We analyze various sources contributing to these inconsistencies and propose strategies to address them, supported by practical case studies. We advocate for incorporating model fitting exercises as a standard practice in cross section publications to enhance the robustness of results. We use a common analysis framework to explore PPP-related challenges with MicroBooNE and T2K data in an unified manner. Our findings offer valuable insights for improving the accuracy and reliability of neutrino-nuclei interaction models, particularly by systematically tuning models using data.

2025-09-22, **Modeling Scintillation Photon Transport and Reconstruction Algorithms for the Time-of-Flight Detector in the T2K Neutrino Experiment**, C. Alt et.al., [2509.17860v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17860v1)

 The T2K ND280 upgrade aims to reduce the systematic uncertainty of the CP-violating phase, $\delta\_{CP}$, to reject non-CP violation hypothesis at $3\sigma$ confidence level. A crucial component of the ND280 upgrade, alongside the Super Fine Grained Detector (SuperFGD) and two High-Angle Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), is the Time-of-Flight (ToF) detector, which significantly enhances background rejection and particle identification capabilities. The ToF detector features six modules in a cube configuration, each with 20 plastic scintillator bars measuring $\text{220}\times\text{12}\times\text{1}\,\text{cm}^3$ and is equipped with Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays at both ends to capture scintillation light. This letter outlines the modelling of the detector response and the signal reconstruction process.

2025-09-22, **Monte Carlo parameter study for Seyfert AGN-starburst composite galaxies NGC1068 and NGC7469**, Silvia Salvatore et.al., [2509.17751v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17751v1)

 Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies host two promising phenomena of non-thermal high-energy radiation. In this regard the IceCube observation of high-energy neutrinos from the direction of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy NGC 1068 is not surprising. More recently, another Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy, NGC 7469, has shown hints for neutrino emission at even higher energies. Theoretical investigations could clarify that their so-called AGN corona is the most-likely origin of these neutrinos due to the need of being partially $\gamma$-ray opaque. In this work, we present an updated version of our Seyfert-starburst composite model from 2022, that accounts for a proper treatment of the stochastic acceleration processes in the AGN corona and the secondary electrons and positrons from leptonic radiation processes. Moreover, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to study the parameter space of these two potential high-energy neutrino sources under consideration of the given prior knowledge. In the case of NGC 1068, we can successfully explain its non-thermal observational features, where both its AGN corona and starburst ring are needed to account for the observations at high- energies. In the case of NGC 7469, the high-energy signatures can only be explained assuming a small coronal radius and the including external $\gamma\gamma$-pair attenuation. In general, both sources exhibit a strong influence of the $\gamma$-ray opaqueness on the results, highlighting the need for an accurate treatment of the intrinsic coronal X-ray field and the spatial extent of the $\gamma$-ray production site.

2025-09-22, **Ultra-high-energy neutrino detection with radio antennas in the ground-based observatory**, Baobiao Yue et.al., [2509.17575v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17575v1)

 Ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos are unique cosmic messengers that can traverse cosmological distances unattenuated, offering direct insight into the most energetic processes in the universe. Radio detection promises significant advantages for detecting highly inclined air showers induced by UHE neutrinos, including a larger exposure range compared to particle detectors, which is due to minimal atmospheric attenuation of radio signals combined with good reconstruction precision. Furthermore, this technique improves the air shower longitudinal reconstruction, which can be used to identify neutrinos with their first interaction far below the top of the atmosphere. In this work, we present a method for identifying UHE neutrinos using radio antennas deployed in ground-based observatories. We introduce a reconstruction algorithm based on the radio emission maximum ($X^{\text{radio}}\_{\text{max}}$) and demonstrate its power in distinguishing deeply developing neutrino-induced showers from background cosmic rays. Using the Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study, we use the simulations of $\nu\_e$-CC-induced air showers and evaluate the trigger efficiency, reconstruction performance, and resulting effective area. Our results show that radio detection significantly enhances the sensitivity to very inclined showers above 1~EeV, complementing traditional surface detectors. This technique is highly scalable and applicable to future radio observatories such as GRAND. The proposed reconstruction and identification strategy provides a pathway toward achieving the sensitivity needed to detect UHE neutrinos.

2025-09-22, **Enhanced Gravitational Effects of Radiation and Cosmological Implications**, Hemza Azri et.al., [2509.17384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17384v1)

 In the momentarily comoving frame of a cosmological fluid, the determinant of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) is highly sensitive to its pressure. This component is significant during radiation-dominated epochs, and becomes naturally negligible as the universe transitions to the matter-dominated era. Here, we investigate the cosmological consequences of gravity sourced by the determinant of the EMT. Unlike Azri and Nasri, Phys. Lett. B 836, 137626 (2023), we consider the most general case in which the second derivative of the perfect-fluid Lagrangian does not vanish. We derive the gravitational field equations for the general power-law case and examine the cosmological implications of the scale-independent model characterized by dimensionless couplings to photons and neutrinos. We show that, unlike various theories based on the EMT, the present setup, which leads to an enhanced gravitational effects of radiation, does not alter the time evolution of the energy density of particle species. Furthermore, we confront the model with the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis, and discuss its potential to alleviate the Hubble tension by reducing the sound horizon. The radiation-gravity couplings we propose here are expected to yield testable cosmological and astrophysical signatures, probing whether gravity distinguishes between relativistic and nonrelativistic species in the early universe.

2025-09-21, **The changing look of the neutrino-emitter blazar candidate 5BZQ J1243+4043**, Alessandra Azzollini et.al., [2509.17211v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17211v1)

 Context. In recent years, changing-look blazars have put into question the traditional BL Lacs-flat spectrum radio quasars empirical classification of blazars based on the intensity of optical spectral lines, as they appear to transition between the two classes over time. Aims. We focus on the blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043, recently proposed as a promising candidate for the emission of high-energy neutrinos observed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and reported as a changing look in the literature. We study the spectral properties of this blazar, inferring its radiation field and accretion regime properties among different epochs. Methods. This study presents new optical spectroscopy observations of 5BZQ J1243+4043 taken with the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We use this new dataset and two optical spectra available from the literature to investigate the continuum and line emissions and pinpoint the physical properties of the source. Results. The newly collected data for 5BZQ J1243+4043 shows broad emission lines, consistent with the spectrum of the first epoch and the redshift $z = 1.5181\pm0.0002$ known from the literature. For the second epoch, the spectrum appears featureless, and we place limits on the emission lines and related physical properties. We observe spectral variability for both the continuum and line emissions among the three spectra. Despite this, the accretion properties of the blazar remain, overall, unvaried, indicating that the intrinsic physics remains the same across the three epochs. In the broader multi-messenger context, this suggests that, despite the changing look in the optical band, the candidate neutrino-emitter blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043 remains characterized by the presence of intense external radiation fields and radiatively efficient accretion, typical of high-excitation radio galaxies, that may foster neutrino production.

2025-09-21, **Probing hadronic interactions with high-energy and low-energy muons in extensive air showers**, Lilly Pyras et.al., [2509.17150v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17150v1)

 High-energy cosmic rays are observed indirectly by detecting the extensive air showers initiated in Earth's atmosphere. The interpretation of experimental data relies on accurate modeling of the air shower development. Simulations based on current hadronic interaction models show significant discrepancies with measurements of the muon content in air showers, commonly referred to as the Muon Puzzle, indicating severe shortcomings in the understanding of particle physics. A hybrid detector design with a surface array and deep underground detector, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, allows simultaneous measurements of muons at two vastly different energies: at GeV energies and above a few 100GeV. We present phenomenological studies of low-energy and high-energy muons in simulated air showers, and discuss how hybrid measurements can provide constraints on multi-particle production in hadronic interaction models.

2025-09-21, **Decaying vector dark matter with low reheating temperature for KM3NeT signal and its impact on gravitational waves**, Sarif Khan et.al., [2509.17129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17129v1)

 We propose a new model to explain the KM3NeT neutrino event through a low reheating scenario with a suppression in the GW spectrum originating from cosmic string networks. To achieve this, we extend the SM gauge sector by an abelian gauge symmetry and a singlet scalar. Once the abelian gauge symmetry spontaneously breaks, the extra gauge boson acquires mass and becomes a suitable Dark Matter (DM) candidate. Due to the kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge group, DM can decay into SM particles. To explain the KM3NeT signal, we need $\mathcal{O}(100)$ PeV DM, which can be produced in the correct order of DM density in a low reheating scenario. In this scenario, the overabundance issue of heavy DM can be tackled by diluting its abundance through the continuous injection of entropy when the matter-like inflaton decays into the SM bath. Using the low reheating scenario, we can obtain the correct value of DM density both for freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms for super-heavy DM. Moreover, we have studied the Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced from cosmic strings, which fall within the detectable range of future proposed GW experiments. Additionally, the dominance of a quadratic inflaton potential before the reheating temperature changes the temperature-scale factor relation, which suppresses the GW spectrum at higher frequencies. Choosing an arbitrarily low reheating temperature provides only a tiny fraction of the DM density due to dilution from entropy injection. This fraction of the vector DM suggests that only the extragalactic contribution is relevant in the KM3NeT event because DM lifetime is shorter than the age of the Universe.

2025-09-21, **Facilitating neutron and energy reconstruction in neutrino events using the direction of tagged neutrons**, Steven Manly et.al., [2509.17123v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17123v1)

 To date, accelerator neutrino experiments have had only limited success including neutrons in the neutrino event reconstruction event by event. Produced neutrons often interact in a detector leaving an energy deposition that does not correlate strongly with the kinetic energy of the neutron. This work explores the inclusion of the direction of a neutron tagged by such an energy deposition in concert with the missing transverse momentum of the reconstructed particles to determine the approximate kinetic energy of the neutron and modify the reconstruction of the energy of the incoming neutrino. The technique significantly increases the neutron kinetic energy estimation relative to one that assigns the neutron kinetic energy by enforcing transverse momentum balance alone. When included in the neutrino energy calculation, the neutrino energy resolution is improved and the reconstructed energy is distributed more symmetrically around the true value. The technique shows promise and might be used to good effect to analyze data taken with experiments able to tag neutron energy deposits with good neutron direction resolution such as the T2K near detector and the liquid argon detectors in the SBN program and DUNE.

2025-09-21, **The Impact of ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(α, γ)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ Reaction on the Evolution of He Stars**, Gang Long et.al., [2509.16948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16948v1)

 The ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction is one of the most important reactions in the evolution of massive stars, yet its rate is still highly uncertain. In this work, we investigated how variations in the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction rate affect the evolution of a 14 $\rm M\_{\odot}$ He star using the MESA code. Our simulations indicate that the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction rate determines the conditions for C burning, affecting its explodability. As the reaction rate increases, central C-burning becomes neutrino-dominated, transitioning from the convective to the radiative regime. This leads to higher compactness and a larger iron core, indicating a more compact pre-SN core structure that is difficult to explode. Conversely, lower reaction rates shorten the C-burning lifetime and trigger earlier central Ne ignition, which counteracts core contraction. This results in reduced compactness and iron core mass. We also found that variations in reaction rates shift the location of the last C-burning shell. When this shell exceeds the mass coordinate used for compactness evaluation, the overall compactness increases significantly. Although the Si- and O-burning convective shells decrease compactness, the overall increase remains unaffected. This work suggests that the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction play an important role in the pre-SN core structure and potentially impact the explodability of massive He stars.

 We present integral field spectroscopic observations of 75 strong gravitational lens candidates identified with a residual neural network in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the ESO's Very Large Telescope. These observations are part of an ongoing effort to build a large, spectroscopically confirmed sample of strong lensing systems for studies on dark matter, galaxy structure, and cosmology. Our MUSE program targets both lens and source redshifts, with particular emphasis on southern hemisphere systems. MUSE's wide spectral coverage and integral field capability allow for efficient identification of multiple sources, lens environments, and weak spectral features. Redshifts for lenses and sources were obtained via manual identification of spectral features in extracted 1D spectra. Our dataset includes systems with complex configurations, such as multiple source planes and group or cluster-scale environments. We extracted and analyzed 185 spectra, successfully determining both the lens and the source redshifts for 48 gravitational lens systems. For an additional 21 targets, we measured the redshifts of the lenses but were unable to determine the redshifts of the background sources. Six targets were confirmed to not be gravitational lenses. The results presented here complement space-based imaging from our HST SNAPshot program and spectroscopic follow-up with DESI and Keck, and have lasting legacy value for identifying interesting high-redshift sources and complex lensing configurations.

2025-09-22, **Molecular clouds as a tool to constraint sub-GeV dark matter and primordial black holes**, A. Salces et.al., [2509.17692v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17692v1)

 Despite decades of direct and indirect searches within the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) framework, no conclusive results have been found in the GeV--TeV range. This has motivated exploring alternatives, including new particles and macroscopic objects. Two well-motivated scenarios are sub-GeV DM and Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Molecular clouds (MCs), typically studied as star-forming sites, can serve as astrophysical laboratories to probe these candidates via their ionization rates. Observations show ionization levels exceeding expectations from known CR fluxes, pointing to an additional ionizing component. Here, we consider electrons and positrons from annihilating and decaying MeV DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from evaporating PBHs, as possible contributors. We model transport driven by energy losses within the clouds. By comparing predicted ionization rates with observations, conservative constraints are set on the thermally averaged cross section $\langle\sigma v\rangle$, decay lifetime $\tau$ and PBH abundances $f\_{PBH}$. The analysis assumes all the observed ionization comes from DM and adopts a 95% confidence level. Results show that, even in the most conservative case of local MCs such as L1551, these constraints are very close to the most competitive bounds from X-ray observations, while inner-Galaxy clouds like DRAGON or G1.4--1.8+87 provide stronger limits, sometimes improving X-ray and cosmological constraints. For sub-GeV DM, MCs exclude parameter space competitive with the one tested by NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, or Voyager, especially below $\sim$30 MeV. In the PBH case, asteroid-mass black holes are restricted to a low fraction of DM, with optimistic scenarios getting close to the strongest limits. This demonstrates the potential of MCs as a novel probe in indirect DM searches.

2025-09-22, **The Hubble Tension resolved by the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations Measurements**, X. D. Jia et.al., [2509.17454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17454v1)

 The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations. However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H\_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H\_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.

2025-09-21, **Multifield Cosmology and the Dark Universe**, Lilia Anguelova et.al., [2509.17179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17179v1)

 Multifield models, arising from multiple scalars interacting with gravity, provide a rich theoretical framework for addressing fundamental problems in modern cosmology. A key role in this regard is played by the so called rapid turn regime, which is characterized by background solutions with strongly non-geodesic field-space trajectories. We review the implications of this regime for a number of problems relevant for cosmological inflation, dark matter and dark energy. We focus, in more detail, on a class of exact rapid-turn solutions that give a model of dynamical dark energy. In this model, the sound speed of the dark energy perturbations is reduced compared to the speed of light, which leads to observational differences from a cosmological constant even for an equation-of-state parameter very close to -1. Furthermore, this model holds promise for the simultaneous alleviation of two prominent cosmological tensions.

 The functionalization of quantum devices to increase their performance and extend their fields of application is an extremely active research area. One of the most promising approaches is to replace aluminum with more performant materials. Within this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials are ideal candidates since they would allow to embed their unique properties into qubits. However, the realization of qubits based on vdW materials other than graphene is yet to be achieved. In this work we present a weakly anharmonic NbSe2 qubit. Our device exhibits a relaxation time T1 = 6.5 +\- 0.4 us which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude larger of other vdW qubits in addition to robustness to photon noise up to 5-10 thermal photons. Our work serves as a demonstrator of the advantage of integration of vdW materials into quantum technologies as well as serving as the first step toward the application of quantum non demolition photon detection protocols in the challenging field of dark matter search.

 Wide-separation lensed quasars (WSLQs) are a rare subclass of strongly lensed quasars produced by massive galaxy clusters. They provide valuable probes of dark-matter halos and quasar host galaxies. However, only about ten WSLQ systems are currently known, which limits further studies. To enlarge the sample from wide-area surveys, we developed a catalog-based pipeline and applied it to the CatNorth database, a catalog of quasar candidates constructed from Gaia DR3. CatNorth contains 1,545,514 quasar candidates with about 90% purity and a Gaia G-band limiting magnitude of roughly 21. The pipeline has three stages. First, we identify groups with separations between 10 and 72 arcsec using a HEALPix grid with 25.6 arcsec spacing and a friends-of-friends search. We then filter by intra-group color and spectral similarity, reducing the 1,545,514 sources to 14,244 groups while retaining all known, discoverable WSLQs. Finally, a visual check, guided by image geometry and the presence of likely foreground lenses, yields the candidate list with quality labels. We identify 333 new WSLQ candidates with separations from 10 to 56.8 arcsec. Using available SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 spectroscopy, we uncover two new candidate systems; the remaining 331 candidates lack sufficient spectra and are labeled as 45 grade A, 98 grade B, and 188 grade C. We also compile 29 confirmed dual quasars as a by-product. When feasible, we plan follow-up spectroscopy and deeper imaging to confirm WSLQs among these candidates and enable the related science.

2025-09-21, **Axions as Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Dark Radiation**, Luca Visinelli et.al., [2509.17059v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17059v1)

 Axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous in extensions of the Standard Model and offer a unifying perspective on open problems in cosmology. Depending on their mass and interactions, axions can act as dark matter, drive cosmic acceleration as dark energy, or contribute to the relativistic background as dark radiation. Motivated by the plenary talk at TAUP 2025, this proceeding reviews the phenomenology of light bosons in the early and late Universe, with a focus on the theoretical foundations, observational signatures, and experimental prospects.

2025-09-21, **Gravitational properties of Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter halos**, Francisco S. N. Lobo et.al., [2509.17033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17033v1)

 Recent studies suggest that dark matter could take the form of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a possibility motivated by anomalies in galactic rotation curves and the missing mass problem in galaxy clusters. We investigate the astrophysical properties of BEC dark matter halos and their potential observational signatures distinguishing them from alternative models. In this framework, dark matter behaves as a self-gravitating Newtonian fluid with a polytropic equation of state of index $n=1$. We derive analytic expressions for the mass distribution, gravitational potential, and dynamical profiles such as the density slope and tangential velocity. The lensing behavior of BEC halos is analyzed, yielding a general series representation of the projected surface density that enables precise predictions for deflection angles, lensing potentials, and magnifications. Finally, halo equilibrium and stability are examined via the scalar and tensor virial theorems, leading to perturbation equations that describe their response to small disturbances. Together, these results provide a unified framework linking the microscopic physics of condensate dark matter to macroscopic halo observables.

2025-09-21, **Exact quasinormal modes in Grumiller spacetime**, Li-Qin Mi et.al., [2509.16991v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16991v1)

 The Grumiller metric is an effective model for gravity at large distances and plays a significant role in constructing galactic models and explaining dark matter. Here, in Grumiller spacetime, we analytically compute the quasinormal-mode frequencies and wave functions for massless particles with spin $\leq 2$ by introducing a new transformation relation. We find that the quasinormal-mode frequencies are identical for different bosons sharing the same quantum number $N$, and similarly for different fermions. However, the frequencies of bosons and fermions never coincide. Moreover, for a given spin state, the corresponding particles exhibit an $(n + 1)$-fold degeneracy. These results provide a theoretical basis for simulating particle waves with identical statistical properties.

2025-09-21, **Investigation of hadronic cross sections of cosmic ray carbon and oxygen on BGO from 200 GeV to 10 TeV energy at the DAMPE experiment**, F. Alemanno et.al., [2509.16943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16943v1)

 The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) has made significant progress in measuring the fluxes of cosmic rays. These new measurements are pivotal in advancing our understanding of the origins and propagation mechanisms of cosmic rays. The bismuth germanium oxide (BGO) calorimeter plays a crucial role in these measurements, particularly in the precise determination of cosmic ray fluxes. However, for a calorimetric experiment like DAMPE, uncertainties in hadronic models persist as a major barrier in achieving more accurate measurements of fluxes of cosmic ray nuclei. This study centers on the measurement of the inelastic hadronic cross sections of carbon and oxygen nuclei interacting with BGO crystals target over an extensive energy range, spanning from 200 GeV to 10 TeV. For carbon nuclei interacting with the BGO target, the measurements of the cross sections have achieved a total relative uncertainty of less than 10% below 8 TeV for carbon, and below 3 TeV for oxygen. For oxygen nuclei, the same level of precision was attained below 3 TeV. Additionally, we compare the experimental results with Geant4 and FLUKA simulations to validate the accuracy and consistency of these simulation tools. Through comprehensive analysis of the inelastic hadronic interaction cross sections, this research provides validation for the hadronic interaction models used in DAMPE's cosmic-ray flux measurements.

2025-09-22, **JADES: the chemical enrichment pattern of distant galaxies - silicon depletion and iron enhancement**, Yuki Isobe et.al., [2509.18055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18055v1)

 We present gas-phase abundances of carbon (C), $\alpha$-elements (O, Ne, Si, and Ar) and iron (Fe) obtained from stacked spectra of high-$z$ star-forming galaxies with the deep Near Infrared Spectrograph medium-resolution data from the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. Our 564 sources at $z=4$--7 have a median stellar mass of $\log(M\_{*}/M\_{\odot})=8.46$ and a median star-formation rate of $\log(\mathrm{SFR}/M\_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}})=0.30$, placing them close to the star-formation main sequence. We find that the stacked spectrum of all our 564 sources has relatively low [C/O]$=-0.70$, moderate [Ne/O]$=-0.09$, and low [Ar/O]$=-0.28$ values at a low gas-phase metallicity of $12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.71$ ($Z\sim 0.1~Z\_\odot$), suggesting dominant yields of core-collapse supernovae evolved from massive stars. The detection of a weak SiIII] emission line in our stacked spectrum provides a silicon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of [Si/O]$=-0.63$, which is lower than that of stars in the Milky Way disc and lower than expected by chemical evolution models, suggesting silicon depletion onto dust grains. Likewise, this Si/O value is lower than that we newly derive for two individual $z>6$ galaxies (GN-z11 and RXCJ2248) with negligible dust attenuation. By performing spectral stacking in bins of $M\_{*}$, SFR, specific SFR (sSFR), and ultra-violet (UV) continuum slope $\beta\_{\mathrm{UV}}$, we identify [FeIII] line detections in the high-sSFR bin and the blue-$\beta\_{\mathrm{UV}}$ bin, both of which exhibit supersolar Fe/O ratios, while their C/O, Ar/O, and Si/O ratios are comparable to those of the all-sources stack. Our findings support a chemically young gas composition with rapid dust depletion in the general population of high-$z$ star-forming galaxies, while raising the possibility of anomalous, selective Fe/O enhancement at the very early epoch of star formation.

2025-09-22, **Late-Time Cosmological Constraints on Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy**, Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano et.al., [2509.17527v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17527v1)

 Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy is a one-parameter extension of the standard HDE framework, in which the horizon entropy is reformulated using Kaniadakis entropy. At the cosmological level, it has been shown to give rise to modified Friedmann equations, leading to a richer phenomenology compared to $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we test the Kanadiakis holography model against multiple late-time observational probes, including Type Ia supernovae from PantheonPlus and Union3, Cosmic Chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Using a Bayesian inference approach with MCMC methods, we constrain the cosmological parameters of the model and evaluate its performance against $\Lambda$CDM through the Akaike Information Criterion. We find that Kaniadakis holography can provide a better fit for some data combinations, although $\Lambda$CDM remains slightly statistically favored overall. These results highlight Kaniadakis holography as a competitive alternative to the standard cosmological model, offering valuable insights into the role of generalized entropy in dark energy dynamics.

 The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations. However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H\_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H\_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.

 We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy challenging the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy models are explored, including $\omega\_0\omega\_a$CDM, logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, and BA, along with non-flat cosmologies accounting for potential spatial curvature. Our analysis supports a flat Universe ($\Omega\_k \approx 0$). Using the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, we analyze data from BAO of DESI DR2, Type Ia Supernovae, and CMB to constrain model parameters. We find strong evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, with deviations from $\Lambda$CDM favoring dynamical dark energy consistent with the Quintom-B scenario ($\omega\_0 > -1$, $\omega\_a < 0$, and $\omega\_0 + \omega\_a < -1$). We also derive upper bounds on $\sum m\_\nu$ from CMB + DESI DR2. For $\Lambda$CDM we find $\sum m\_\nu < 0.066~\text{eV}$, while for $\omega$CDM it is $\sum m\_\nu < 0.075~\text{eV}$. In o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM the limits are $\sum m\_\nu < 0.263~\text{eV}$ and $\sum m\_\nu < 0.520~\text{eV}$, respectively. For other models, including $\omega\_0\omega\_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE, the upper limits range from $< 0.043~\text{eV}$ to $< 0.127~\text{eV}$. Constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N\_{\text{eff}}$, remain consistent with the standard value $N\_{\text{eff}} = 3.044$ for all models. Bayesian evidence shows that combining DES-SN5Y and Union3 SNe Ia with CMB + DESI DR2 reveals deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, while no model reaches the $5\sigma$ threshold, some show $> 3\sigma$ tensions with DES-SN5YR or Union3, hinting at cracks in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.

 The $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction governs the carbon-to-oxygen ratio set during helium burning, shaping white-dwarf structure and Type~Ia supernova yields. At the astrophysical energy $E \approx 300~\mathrm{keV}$, the cross section is controlled by the subthreshold $1^{-}$ (7.12~MeV) and $2^{+}$ (6.92~MeV) states, whose contributions depend on their asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) $C\_{1}$ and $C\_{2}$, respectively. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the $S\_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ and $S\_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ factors using calibrated $R$-matrix mappings and experimental ANC constraints for the $1^{-}$, $2^{+}$, and $0^{+}$ ground state. For $S\_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, flat prior on the $1^{-}$ ANC lead to broad posterior with $68\%$ credible interval spanning $ [71.4,\,93.4]$~keV\,b, while Gaussian priors concentrate weight near the reported ANC values and yield narrower posteriors. For $S\_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, the analysis includes the interference of the radiative transition through the subthreshold resonance with the direct capture to the ground-state, which depends on the ground-state ANC $C\_{0}$, giving broad posterior with $68\%$ credible interval spanning $[30.7,\,50.5]$~keV\,b. The Gaussian priors centered near anchor values. The resulting posteriors quantify both correlations and uncertainties: despite incorporating the published ANC constraints, the $68\%$ intervals remain broad, showing that present ANC determinations do not yet reduce the astrophysical uncertainty. Overall, the Bayesian framework provides statistically robust posteriors for $S\_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ and $S\_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, improving the reliability of extrapolations for stellar modeling and nucleosynthesis.

2025-09-21, **On Atomic Line Opacities for Modeling Astrophysical Radiative Transfer**, Jonathan Morag et.al., [2509.17003v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17003v1)

 In astrophysics, line opacity is a primary source of uncertainty in theoretical calculations of radiative transfer. Much of this uncertainty is dominated by the inability to resolve the width and separation in frequency of sharp atomic transition lines, leading to the common use of approximate frequency-averaged treatments for the lines. In a previous paper, we calculated shock-cooling emission following explosions in core-collapse supernovae using a mult-group radiative transfer code, and compared the results to those of the similar and often used STELLA code from the literature. We found important differences in the spectral energy distribution (SED) resulting from different choices of line opacity treatment. In our code, we used in the emissivity a frequency-binned average of a high-resolution opacity, while in STELLA the often-used Eastman Pinto 1993 (EP93) prescription was employed. In this short letter we revisit this comparison, essentially reproducing STELLA bound-free (photoionization) and bound-bound (line transition) opacities. We show the importance of introducing micro-plasma electron excitation level cutoffs in the equation of state (EOS). We also argue that EP93 is useful for estimating photon mean free-path in the presence of a forest of lines, but that it can underestimate photon production and reprocessing rates (emissivity) by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, no fully-consistent coarse-frequency solution currently exists for line modeling in these systems. Finally, we describe new features in our updated publicly available high-resolution frequency-dependent opacity table.

2025-09-21, **Radiation Mediated Shock and Planar Shock Breakout in the Presence of Atomic Transition Lines**, Jonathan Morag et.al., [2509.16996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16996v1)

 We numerically study fast Newtonian radiation mediated shocks (RMS - v/c~0.2) in two simplified problems in the context of supernova shock breakout; (1) An RMS traveling in a uniform medium, and (2) an RMS escaping a powerlaw density profile in planar geometry (\rho~x^n). Both problems were previously solved in the literature assuming a fully ionized plasma medium emitting Bremstrahllung. It was shown that at high shock velocities photons can deviate from local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and reach distributions peaked at many keV.   In this study we incorporate, for the first time, opacity from bound species of heavy elements (solar-like composition) into these two problems, at times drastically augmenting the photon production due to bound-free and bound-bound radiative processes. We use a previously developed hydrodynamically coupled multi-group radiative diffusion code, including inelastic Compton scattering and frequency-dependent opacity from the publicly available TOPS table. Adding a more realistic opacity leads the radiation to maintain LTE at higher velocities in comparison to the fully ionized problem.   In the planar SBO problem this opacity can reduce the emission temperature by half and even an order of magnitude. This result is important for the observation of supernova shock breakout emission. The SED of SN envelope breakout will very likely remain in LTE for explosions in red super giant stars without stellar wind (and part of blue super giant star explosions), making X-Ray observations less likely in these cases by orders of magnitude relative to previous predictions. We provide a semi-analytic description for the SED in the case where LTE is maintained. A correct shock-breakout calculation requires opacity tables that include bound yet highly ionized species, ruling out the use of certain line tables (such as the commonly used Kurucz table).
