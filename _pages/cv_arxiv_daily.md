2023-06-22, **Disentangle Neutrino Electromagnetic Properties with Atomic Radiative Pair Emission**, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., [2306.12953v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12953v1)

 We elaborate the possibility of using the atomic radiative emission of neutrino pair (RENP) to probe the neutrino electromagnetic properties, including magnetic and electric dipole moments, charge radius, and anapole. With the typical O(eV) momentum transfer, the atomic RENP is sensitive to not just the tiny neutrino masses but also very light mediators to which the massless photon belongs. The neutrino EM properties introduce extra contribution besides the SM one induced by the heavy W/Z gauge bosons. Since the associated photon spectrum is divided into several sections whose boundaries are determined by the final-state neutrino masses, it is possible to identify the individual neutrino EM form factor elements. Most importantly, scanning the photon spectrum inside the particular section with deviation from the SM prediction once observed allows identification of the neutrino EM form factor type. The RENP provides an ultimate way of disentangling the neutrino EM properties to go beyond the current experimental searches or observations.

2023-06-22, **Possible contribution of X-ray binary jets to the Galactic cosmic ray and neutrino flux**, Dimitrios Kantzas et.al., [2306.12715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12715v1)

 For over a century, the identification of high-energy cosmic ray (CR) sources remains an open question. For Galactic CRs with energy up to $10^{15}$ eV, supernova remnants (SNRs) have traditionally been thought the main candidate source. However, recent TeV gamma-ray observations have questioned the SNR paradigm. Propagating CRs are deflected by the Galactic magnetic field, hence, gamma-rays and neutrinos produced via inelastic hadronic interactions are the only means for unveiling the CR sources. In this work, we study the gamma-ray and neutrino emission produced by CRs accelerated inside Galactic jets of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries (BHXBs). We calculate the intrinsic neutrino emission of two prototypical BHXBs, Cygnus X-1 and GX 339-4, for which we have high-quality, quasi-simultaneous multiwavelength spectra. Based on these prototypical sources, we discuss the likelihood of the 35 known Galactic BHXBs to be efficient CR accelerators. Moreover, we estimate the potential contribution to the CR spectrum of a viable population of BHXBs that reside in the Galactic plane. When these BHXBs go into outburst, they may accelerate particles up to 100s of TeV that contribute to the diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino spectra while propagating in the Galactic medium. Using HERMES, an open-source code that calculates the hadronic processes along the line of sight, we discuss the contribution of BHXBs to the diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, and compare these to their intrinsic gamma-ray and neutrino emissions. Finally, we discuss the contribution of BHXBs to the observed spectrum of Galactic CRs.

2023-06-22, **Freeze-in at stronger coupling**, Catarina Cosme et.al., [2306.13061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13061v1)

 Predictivity of many non-thermal dark matter (DM) models is marred by the gravitational production background. This problem is ameliorated in models with lower reheating temperature $T\_R$, which allows for dilution of gravitationally produced relics. We study the freeze-in dark matter production mechanism in the thermal bath with the electroweak scale temperature. The process is Boltzmann-suppressed if the dark matter mass is above $T\_R$. In this case, the coupling to the thermal bath has to be significant to account for the observed dark matter relic density. As a result, the direct DM detection experiments already probe such freeze-in models, excluding significant parts of parameter space. The forthcoming experiments will explore this framework further, extending to lower couplings and higher reheating temperatures.

2023-06-22, **Methodological Reflections on the MOND/Dark Matter Debate**, Patrick M. Duerr et.al., [2306.13026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13026v1)

 The paper re-examines the principal methodological questions, arising in the debate over the cosmological standard model's postulate of Dark Matter vs. rivalling proposals that modify standard (Newtonian and general-relativistic) gravitational theory, the so-called Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and its subsequent extensions. What to make of such seemingly radical challenges of cosmological orthodoxy? In the first part of our paper, we assess MONDian theories through the lens of key ideas of major 20th century philosophers of science (Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos, and Laudan), thereby rectifying widespread misconceptions and misapplications of these ideas common in the pertinent MOND-related literature. None of these classical methodological frameworks, which render precise and systematise the more intuitive judgements prevalent in the scientific community, yields a favourable verdict on MOND and its successors -- contrary to claims in the MOND-related literature by some of these theories' advocates; the respective theory appraisals are largely damning. Drawing on these insights, the paper's second part zooms in on the most common complaint about MONDian theories, their ad-hocness. We demonstrate how the recent coherentist model of ad-hocness captures, and fleshes out, the underlying -- but too often insufficiently articulated -- hunches underlying this critique. MONDian theories indeed come out as severely ad hoc: they do not cohere well with either theoretical or empirical-factual background knowledge. In fact, as our complementary comparison with the cosmological standard model's Dark Matter postulate shows, with respect to ad-hocness, MONDian theories fare worse than the cosmological standard model.

2023-06-22, **Collider Signatures of Near-Continuum Dark Matter**, Steven Ferrante et.al., [2306.13009v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13009v1)

 In this paper we study a near-continuum dark matter model, in which dark sector consists of a tower of closely spaced states with weak-scale masses. We construct a five-dimensional model which naturally realizes this spectrum. The dark matter is described by a bulk field, which interacts with the brane-localized Standard Model sector via a Z portal. We then study collider signatures of this model. Near-continuum dark matter states produced in a collider undergo cascade decays, resulting in events with high multiplicity of jets and leptons, large missing energy, and displaced vertices. A custom-built Monte Carlo tool described in this paper allows for detailed simulation of the signal events. We present results of such simulations for the case of electron-positron collisions.

2023-06-22, **Reviving sub-TeV $SU(2)_L$ lepton doublet Dark Matter**, Purusottam Ghosh et.al., [2306.12906v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12906v1)

 In this work we study the hybrid kind of dark matter(DM) production mechanism where both thermal and non-thermal contribution at two different epochs set the DM relic abundance. This hybrid set up in turn shifts the parameter space of DM in contrast to pure thermal DM scenario. We review such production mechanism in the context of the $SU(2)\_L$ lepton doublet dark matter ($\Psi$) augmented with an additional singlet dark scalar ($S$). The neutral component of the dark doublet can serve as a stable DM candidate and in pure thermal scenario, it is under-abundant as well as excluded from direct detection constraints due to its strong gauge interactions in the sub-TeV mass regime. However, in addition to the thermal contribution, the late time non-thermal DM production from the decay of the long-lived dark scalar $S$ helps to fulfill the deficit in DM abundance. On the other hand, the strong gauge mediated direct detection constraint can be evaded with the help of a $SU(2)\_L$ triplet scalar(with $Y=2$), resulting a pseudo-Dirac DM. To realize our proposed scenario we impose a discrete $\mathcal{Z}\_2$ symmetry under which both $\Psi$ and $S$ are odd while rest of the fields are even. We find the lepton doublet pseudo-Dirac DM with mass $\sim 550-1200$ GeV, compatible with the observed relic density, direct, indirect, and existing collider search constraints.

2023-06-22, **Searching for dark matter substructure: a deeper wide-area community survey for Roman**, Tansu Daylan et.al., [2306.12864v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12864v1)

 We recommend a deeper extension to the High-Latitute Wide Area Survey planned to be conducted by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (\emph{Roman}). While this deeper-tier survey extension can support a range of astrophysical investigations, it is particularly well suited to characterize the dark matter substructure in galactic halos and reveal the microphysics of dark matter through gravitational lensing. We quantify the expected yield of \emph{Roman} for finding galaxy-galaxy-type gravitational lenses and motivate observational choices to optimize the \emph{Roman} core community surveys for studying dark matter substructure. In the proposed survey, we expect to find, on average, one strong lens with a characterizable substructure per \emph{Roman} tile (0.28 squared degrees), yielding approximately 500 such high-quality lenses. With such a deeper legacy survey, \emph{Roman} will outperform any current and planned telescope within the next decade in its potential to characterize the concentration and abundance of dark matter subhalos in the mass range 10$^7$-10$^{11}$\,M$\_{\odot}$.

2023-06-22, **Extragalactic Star Cluster Science with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's High Latitude Wide Area Survey and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory**, Kristen C. Dage et.al., [2306.12620v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12620v1)

 The Nancy Grace Roman Telescope's High Latitude Wide Area Survey will have a number of synergies with the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), particularly for extragalactic star clusters. Understanding the nature of star clusters and star cluster systems are key topics in many areas of astronomy, chief among them stellar evolution, high energy astrophysics, galaxy assembly/dark matter, the extragalactic distance scale, and cosmology. One of the challenges will be disentangling the age/metallicity degeneracy because young ($\sim$Myr) metal-rich clusters have similar SEDs to old ($\sim$Gyr) metal-poor clusters. Rubin will provide homogeneous, $ugrizy$ photometric coverage, and measurements in the red Roman filters will help break the age-metallicity and age-extinction degeneracies, providing the first globular cluster samples that cover wide areas while essentially free of contamination from Milky Way stars. Roman's excellent spatial resolution will also allow measurements of cluster sizes. We advocate for observations of a large sample of galaxies with a range of properties and morphologies in the Rubin/LSST footprint matching the depth of the LSST Wide-Fast-Deep field $i$ band limit (26.3 mag), and recommend adding the F213 filter to the survey.

2023-06-22, **Shock cooling of a red-supergiant supernova at redshift 3 in lensed images**, Wenlei Chen et.al., [2306.12985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12985v1)

 The core-collapse supernova of a massive star rapidly brightens when a shock, produced following the collapse of its core, reaches the stellar surface. As the shock-heated star subsequently expands and cools, its early-time light curve should have a simple dependence on the progenitor's size and therefore final evolutionary state. Measurements of the progenitor's radius from early light curves exist for only a small sample of nearby supernovae, and almost all lack constraining ultraviolet observations within a day of explosion. The several-day time delays and magnifying ability of galaxy-scale gravitational lenses, however, should provide a powerful tool for measuring the early light curves of distant supernovae, and thereby studying massive stellar populations at high redshift. Here we analyse individual rest-frame ultraviolet-through-optical exposures taken with the Hubble Space Telescope that simultaneously capture, in three separate gravitationally lensed images, the early phases of a supernova at redshift $z \approx 3$ beginning within $5.8\pm 3.1$ hr of explosion. The supernova, seen at a lookback time of $\sim11.5$ billion years, is strongly lensed by an early-type galaxy in the Abell 370 cluster. We constrain the pre-explosion radius to be $533^{+154}\_{-119}$ solar radii, consistent with a red supergiant. Highly confined and massive circumstellar material at the same radius can also reproduce the light curve, but is unlikely since no similar low-redshift examples are known.

2023-06-22, **Type Ia Supernova Nucleosynthesis: Metallicity-Dependent Yields**, James D Keegans et.al., [2306.12885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12885v1)

 Type Ia supernova explosions (SNIa) are fundamental sources of elements for the chemical evolution of galaxies. They efficiently produce intermediate-mass (with Z between 11 and 20) and iron group elements - for example, about 70% of the solar iron is expected to be made by SNIa. In this work, we calculate complete abundance yields for 39 models of SNIa explosions, based on three progenitors - a 1.4M deflagration detonation model, a 1.0 double detonation model and a 0.8 M double detonation model - and 13 metallicities, with 22Ne mass fractions of 0, 1x10-7, 1x10-6, 1x10-5, 1x10-4, 1x10-3, 2x10-3, 5x10-3, 1x10-2, 1.4x10-2, 5x10-2, and 0.1 respectively. Nucleosynthesis calculations are done using the NuGrid suite of codes, using a consistent nuclear reaction network between the models. Complete tables with yields and production factors are provided online at Zenodo: Yields. We discuss the main properties of our yields in the light of the present understanding of SNIa nucleosynthesis, depending on different progenitor mass and composition. Finally, we compare our results with a number of relevant models from the literature.

2023-06-22, **No plateau observed in late-time near-infrared observations of the underluminous Type Ia supernova 2021qvv**, O. Graur et.al., [2306.12858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12858v1)

 Near-infrared (NIR) observations of normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained between 150 to 500 d past maximum light reveal the existence of an extended plateau. Here, we present observations of the underluminous, 1991bg-like SN 2021qvv. Early, ground-based optical and NIR observations show that SN 2021qvv is similar to SN 2006mr, making it one of the dimmest, fastest-evolving 1991bg-like SNe to date. Late-time (170-250 d) Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN 2021qvv reveal no sign of a plateau. An extrapolation of these observations backwards to earlier-phase NIR observations of SN 2006mr suggests the complete absence of a NIR plateau, at least out to 250 d. This absence may be due to the lower temperatures of the ejecta of 1991bg-like SNe, relative to normal SNe Ia, which might preclude their becoming fluorescent and shifting ultraviolet light into the NIR. This suggestion can be tested by acquiring NIR imaging of a sample of 1991bg-like SNe that covers the entire range from slowly-evolving to fast-evolving events ($0.2 \lesssim s\_\mathrm{BV} \lesssim 0.6$). A detection of the NIR plateau in slower-evolving, hotter 1991bg-like SNe would provide further evidence that these SNe exist along a continuum with normal SNe Ia. Theoretical progenitor and explosion scenarios would then have to match the observed properties of both SN Ia subtypes.

2023-06-22, **Constraints on the cosmological parameters with three-parameter correlation of Gamma-ray bursts**, Jia-Lun Li et.al., [2306.12840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12840v1)

 As one of the most energetic and brightest events, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be treated as a promising probe of the high-redshift universe. Similar to type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), GRBs with same physical origin could be treated as standard candles. We select GRB samples with the same physical origin, which are divided into two groups. One group is consisted of 31 GRBs with a plateau phase feature of a constant luminosity followed by a decay index of about -2 in the X-ray afterglow light curves, and the other has 50 GRBs with a shallow decay phase in the optical light curves. For the selected GRB samples, we confirm that there is a tight correlation between the plateau luminosity $L\_0$, the end time of plateau $t\_b$ and the isotropic energy release $E\_{\gamma,iso}$. We also find that the $L\_0-t\_b-E\_{\gamma,iso}$ correlation is insensitive to the cosmological parameters and no valid limitations on the cosmological parameters can be obtained using this correlation. We explore a new three-parameter correlation $L\_0$, $t\_b$, and the spectral peak energy in the rest frame $E\_{p,i}$ ($L\_0-t\_b-E\_{p,i}$), and find that this correlation can be used as a standard candle to constrain the cosmological parameters. By employing the optical sample only, we find the constraints of $\Omega\_m = 0.697\_{-0.278}^{+0.402}(1\sigma)$ for a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. For the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model, the best-fitting results are $\Omega\_m = 0.713\_{-0.278}^{+0.346}$, $\Omega\_{\Lambda} = 0.981\_{-0.580}^{+0.379}(1\sigma)$. For the combination of the X-ray and optical smaples, we find $\Omega\_m = 0.313\_{-0.125}^{+0.179}(1\sigma)$ for a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $\Omega\_m = 0.344\_{-0.112}^{+0.176}$, $\Omega\_{\Lambda} = 0.770\_{-0.416}^{+0.366}(1\sigma)$ for a non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model.

2023-06-22, **Condensation Calculations in Planetary Science and Cosmochemistry**, Denton S. Ebel et.al., [2306.12645v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12645v1)

 Cool a piece of the Sun to 1000 K at one millibar pressure to yield a mineral assemblage consistent with those found in the most primitive meteorites. This is an equilibrium or fractional condensation experiment simulated by calculations using equations of state for hundreds of gaseous molecules, condensed mineral solids, and silicate liquids, the products of a century of experimental measurements and theoretical studies. Such calculations have revolutionized our understanding of the chemistry of the cosmos.   The mid-20th Century realization that meteorites are fossil records of the early Solar System made chemistry central to understanding planetary origins. Thus "condensation", the distribution of elements and isotopes between vapor and condensed solids and/or liquids at or approaching chemical equilibrium, deeply informs discussion of how meteor/comet compositions bear on planets.   Condensation calculations have been applied to disks around young stars, to the mineral "rain" of mineral grains expected to form in cool dwarf star atmospheres, to the expanding envelopes of giant stars, to the vapor plumes that form in planetary impacts, and to the chemically and isotopically distinct "shells" computed and observed to exist in supernovae. As with all sophisticated calculations, there are inherent caveats, subtleties, and computational difficulties.   Local chemistry has yet to be consistently integrated into dynamical astrophysical simulations so that effects like the blocking of radiation by grains, absorption and reemission of light by grains, and buffering of heat by grain evaporation/condensation feed back into the physics at each node of a gridded calculation over time. A deeper integration of thermochemistry with physical models makes the prospect of a general protoplanetary disk model as hopeful now as a general circulation model for global climate was in the early 1970's.
