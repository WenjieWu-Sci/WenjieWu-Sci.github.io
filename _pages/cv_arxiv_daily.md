2025-06-26, **3C 403: a candidate neutrino-emitting radio galaxy**, Gabriele Bruni et.al., [2506.21403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21403v1)

 3C 403 is a well known FRII radio galaxy, whose jets extend up to the kpc scale. In this letter, we present its identification as the second most significant source among the more than 150 inspected using the 15-year neutrino dataset of the ANTARES Collaboration, possibly making it the first radio galaxy with neutrino emission. Following the previous association of blazars with netrinos events, we aimed at studying the jet properties and its possible role in neutrino production. We collected multi-scale radio observations to assess the properties of the jet from the kpc to pc scale. Moreover, the high-energy properties of its AGN were inspected. Through the analysis of the jet orientation on the different scales, we verified that neither the inner nor the extended jet seems to have a viewing angle close to the line of sight. Instead, the jet seems to lie on the plane of the sky. In addition, we tested the recently proposed scaling relation between neutrino and hard X-rays fluxes, identified for blazars and Seyfert galaxies, against the measured fluxes for 3C 304. We found that the source lies in the region between blazars and Seyferts, altough the current upper limit on neutrino flux does not allow us to be conclusive on the correlation. In these regards, 3C 403 is an intermediate case between the previous cases of neutrino associations, providing a useful test case for future models.

2025-06-26, **Proto-neutron Stars with Dark Matter Admixture: A Single-Fluid Approach**, Adamu Issifu et.al., [2506.21378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21378v1)

 This work investigates the impact of dark matter (DM) on the microscopic and macroscopic properties of proto-neutron stars (PNSs). We employ a single-fluid framework in which DM interacts with ordinary matter (OM) via the Higgs portal and remains in thermal equilibrium through non-gravitational interactions. Using a quasi-static approximation, we analyze the evolution of PNSs during the Kelvin--Helmholtz phase by varying the DM mass while keeping the entropy per baryon and lepton fraction fixed. Our results show that DM absorbs thermal energy from the stellar medium without efficient re-emission, thereby altering neutrino emission and affecting the star's thermal evolution history. Furthermore, neutrinos contribute significantly to pressure support in the PNS phase, inhibiting DM mass accretion during neutrino-trapped stages. Based on the requirement to satisfy the observed $2\,\rm M\_\odot$ neutron star mass constraint and to maintain consistency with supernova remnant data, we suggest an upper limit of $m\_\chi \leq 0.62\,\rm GeV$ for the DM mass that can accrete in evolving PNSs. In contrast, we established that cold neutron stars (NSs) can support higher DM masses without compromising equilibrium stability, owing to increased central density, enhanced gravitational binding energy, and reduced thermal pressure.

2025-06-26, **JUNO 20-inch PMT and electronics system characterization using large pulses of PMT dark counts at the Pan-Asia testing platform**, Caimei Liu et.al., [2506.21179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21179v1)

 The main goal of the JUNO experiment is to determine the neutrino mass ordering with a 20kt liquid-scintillator detector. The 20-inch PMT and its 1F3 (one for three) electronics are crucial to realize the excellent energy resolution of at least 3% at 1MeV. The knowledge on the PMT and 1F3 electronics response is critical for detector performance understanding. A study of the JUNO 20-inch PMT and 1F3 electronics system characterization is presented using large pulses of PMT dark count at the Pan-Asia testing platform in China. Thanks to its broad amplitude range and high rate, the large pulse signals are also used to investigate the PMT after pulse response.

2025-06-26, **An Accretion Flare Interpretation for the UHE Neutrino Event KM3-230213A**, Chengchao Yuan et.al., [2506.21111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21111v1)

 We study the origin of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) astrophysical neutrino event KM3-230213A detected by KM3NeT, focusing on MRC 0614-083 which has been pinpointed as the closest blazar to the neutrino localization. A joint interpretation of the optical, infrared, and X-ray light curves suggests that MRC 0614-083 has undergone a super-Eddington accretion flare accompanied by efficient proton acceleration. That flare has initiated a delayed infrared echo within the surrounding dust torus, which serves as a target for photomeson ($p\gamma$) interactions such that a self-consistent picture emerges: the predicted UHE neutrino flux is at the level expected from joint $E^{-2}$ fit with the IceCube measurements at lower energies, the variable nature of the event alleviates the tension with IceCube limits, and the accompanying electromagnetic cascade describes the X-ray flare around the neutrino detection time. Since a key remaining uncertainty is the unknown redshift of the source, we strongly encourage optical/ultraviolet spectroscopic measurements to determine its redshift.

2025-06-25, **Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics at Colliders**, Pedro Machado et.al., [2506.20855v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20855v1)

 Nonzero neutrino masses guarantee new physics and neutrinos are excellent probes of extreme environments in the Universe. The recent collider neutrino experimental program, including FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC, along with the planned Forward Physics Facility at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, is opening a new window into neutrino physics and astrophysics. In this article, we review recent achievements and prospects of collider neutrino experiments, including key achievements such as the first measurements of collider neutrino interactions at unprecedented energies and the exploration of new physics scenarios, like dark matter candidates, sterile neutrinos, and non-standard neutrino interactions. For concreteness, we will focus on the significant scientific opportunities presented by the Forward Physics Facility, which will enable precision measurements of neutrino cross sections and proton structure at low parton momentum fraction. Furthermore, collider neutrino studies will substantially reduce systematic uncertainties in calculating atmospheric neutrino fluxes, thereby improving astrophysical neutrino observations as well as advancing our understanding of cosmic-ray interactions.

2025-06-25, **A Black Hole is Born: 3D GRMHD Simulation of Black Hole Formation from Core-Collapse**, Goni Halevi et.al., [2506.20837v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20837v1)

 We present the first three-dimensional, fully general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulation of a black hole (BH) formed from the collapsed core of a massive star. The ability to self-consistently capture the birth of a compact remnant in 3D is crucial for modeling natal BH properties (including masses, spins, and kicks), which are of particular interest in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. However, such simulations have remained elusive due to extreme computational challenges and demands. We employ the GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code GRaM-X to follow the collapse, core-bounce, shock propagation, and eventual BH formation of a massive stellar progenitor in full 3D. We initialize our simulation by mapping a one-dimensional (1D) model of a star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass of $45 M\_\odot$ to 3D. We use moderate rotation (consistent with expectations from stellar evolution modeling) and a relatively weak dipolar magnetic field. The collapsing core drives a shock that reaches a maximum radius of roughly 170 km before stalling and does not lead to a successful explosion. The proto-neutron star accretes matter before collapsing to form a BH $t\_{BH} \approx 325$ ms after core-bounce. The time of BH formation and initial BH mass are remarkably similar to those obtained with GR1D, a 1D general-relativistic neutrino-hydrodynamics code, to which we compare our results. We track the horizon of the newborn BH after formation and calculate a steady kick velocity of $v\_{kick} \approx 72$ km/s and a mass of $M\_{BH} \approx 2.62 M\_\odot$, which is still rising at the end of the simulation.

2025-06-25, **Diagnosing electron-neutrino lepton number crossings in core-collapse supernovae: a comparison of methods**, Marie Cornelius et.al., [2506.20723v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20723v1)

 Fast neutrino flavor conversion may impact the explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae. A necessary condition for fast flavor conversion is the presence of crossings in the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN crossing). Because of the computational costs, flavor-dependent angular distributions are not computed by the vast majority of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations; instead, angular distributions are reconstructed employing approximate methods in post-processing. In this work, we evaluate the performance of four methods adopted to diagnose the existence of ELN crossings. For selected post-bounce times, we extract the fluid and thermodynamic properties from spherically symmetric supernova simulations for an $18.6 M\_\odot$ progenitor, testing cases with and without muons as well as with and without mixing-length treatment of proto-neutron star convection. We compare the occurrence of crossings in the angular distributions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations with those in distributions reconstructed from angular moments of our Boltzmann solutions by using the maximum entropy and Minerbo schemes, and also with crossings identified via a polynomial weighting function applied to the angular moments. Our results show that the polynomial method and the Minerbo closure scheme have severe limitations. The maximum entropy approach captures most of the forward crossings, although it fails to reproduce or misidentifies crossings in a subset of our models. These findings highlight the need for robust modeling of the neutrino angular properties in order to assess the impact of flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism.

2025-06-25, **A Flavor of SO(10) Unification with a Spinor Higgs**, Juanca Carrasco-Martinez et.al., [2506.20708v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20708v1)

 We investigate Higgs Parity Unification-a realization of $SO(10)$ grand unification based on the Higgs Parity mechanism in which the Standard Model (SM) Higgs resides in a spinor representation. The theory has an intermediate left-right symmetric stage where the $SU(2)\_R$ symmetry breaking scale is fixed by the vanishing of the SM Higgs quartic coupling. The strong $CP$ problem is solved by parity. Gauge coupling unification successfully predicts $\alpha\_s(M\_Z)$ to within 1%. The spinor Higgs naturally leads to a seesaw origin for SM flavor observables. We identify a novel mechanism where large mixing of third generation fermions with additional heavy vector-like fermions accounts for the anarchical nature of the PMNS matrix and the lack of hierarchy in the neutrino mass spectrum, relative to the up-quarks. A fit to quark and lepton masses and mixings, with a minimal parameter set, predicts 1) A testable relation between the top quark mass and $\alpha\_s(M\_Z)$ which is about $(1-2)\sigma$ from current best fit values, 2) The order of magnitude of the baryon asymmetry of the universe, via leptogenesis from second-generation right-handed neutrino decays. 3) The proton decay and the neutron EDM are likely observable in next generation experiments, and 4) A normal ordered neutrino mass spectrum where $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay and the mass of the lightest neutrino are out of reach of next generation experiments.

2025-06-25, **SuperSONIC: Cloud-Native Infrastructure for ML Inferencing**, Dmitry Kondratyev et.al., [2506.20657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20657v1)

 The increasing computational demand from growing data rates and complex machine learning (ML) algorithms in large-scale scientific experiments has driven the adoption of the Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors (SONIC) approach. SONIC accelerates ML inference by offloading it to local or remote coprocessors to optimize resource utilization. Leveraging its portability to different types of coprocessors, SONIC enhances data processing and model deployment efficiency for cutting-edge research in high energy physics (HEP) and multi-messenger astrophysics (MMA). We developed the SuperSONIC project, a scalable server infrastructure for SONIC, enabling the deployment of computationally intensive tasks to Kubernetes clusters equipped with graphics processing units (GPUs). Using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, SuperSONIC decouples client workflows from server infrastructure, standardizing communication, optimizing throughput, load balancing, and monitoring. SuperSONIC has been successfully deployed for the CMS and ATLAS experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (IceCube), and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and tested on Kubernetes clusters at Purdue University, the National Research Platform (NRP), and the University of Chicago. SuperSONIC addresses the challenges of the Cloud-native era by providing a reusable, configurable framework that enhances the efficiency of accelerator-based inference deployment across diverse scientific domains and industries.

2025-06-25, **Excitation of the non-resonant streaming instability around sources of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays**, Alessandro Cermenati et.al., [2506.20646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20646v1)

 The interpretation of the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray spectrum (UHECRs) and composition suggests a suppression of the flux below $\sim$1 EeV, as observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array. A natural explanation for this phenomenon involves magnetic confinement effects. We investigate the possibility that UHECRs self-generate the magnetic turbulence necessary for such confinement via current-driven plasma instabilities. Specifically, we show that the electric current produced by escaping UHECRs can excite a non-resonant streaming instability in the surrounding plasma. This instability reduces the diffusion coefficient in the source environment, effectively trapping particles with energies $E \lesssim 0.6$ EeV $\mathcal{L}\_{45}^{1/2} R\_{\text{Mpc}}^{-1} \lambda\_{10}^{2}$ for times exceeding the age of the Universe. Here, $\mathcal{L}\_{45}$ is the source luminosity in units of $10^{45}$ erg/s, $R\_{\text{Mpc}}$ is the radial size in Mpc, and $\lambda\_{10}$ is the intergalactic magnetic field coherence length in units of 10 Mpc. We discuss in detail the conditions, in terms of source luminosity, initial magnetic field, and the environment in which this phenomenon occurs, that need to be fulfilled in order for self-confinement to take place near a source of UHECRs. By modeling a population of UHECR sources with a luminosity function typical of extragalactic gamma-ray sources, we connect the spectrum of escaping particles to the luminosity distribution. Furthermore, we calculate the contribution of these confined particles to cosmogenic neutrino production, finding consistency with current observational constraints. Our results suggest that self-induced turbulence may play an important role in shaping the UHECR spectrum and, in particular, may account for the flux suppression near their sources, offering a promising framework for interpreting current observations.

2025-06-25, **Analytic formulation of Leptogenesis with neutrino oscillation data employing the general parametrization for neutrino mass matrix**, Nobuchika Okada et.al., [2506.20580v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20580v1)

 The observed neutrino oscillations and baryon asymmetry, unexplained by the Standard Model (SM), can both be accounted for by extending the SM to include Majorana right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). Tiny neutrino masses naturally arise through the Type-I seesaw mechanism, which involves lepton number violation. Meanwhile, the baryon asymmetry can be generated via leptogenesis, where the out-of-equilibrium decay of RHNs produces a lepton asymmetry that is partially converted into a baryon asymmetry through sphaleron processes. The Dirac Yukawa couplings play the crucial role for both Type-I seesaw and leptogenesis. In this work, we derive an analytic expression for the CP asymmetry parameter in a general parametrization. Focusing on a hierarchical RHN mass spectrum, we evaluate the lowest mass of the lightest RHN that reproduce both neutrino oscillation data and the observed baryon asymmetry. We study the case with two and three generations of RHNs for both thermal and non-thermal leptogenesis scenarios. Besides the standard Type-I seesaw involving SM Higgs doublet, we also examine the Type-I seesaw with a new neutrinophillic Higgs doublet. In this case for non-thermal leptogenesis, the minimum value for the lightest RHN mass can be as low as sphaleron decoupling temperature.

2025-06-25, **Operation of the Trigger System for the ICARUS Detector at Fermilab**, ICARUS collaboration et.al., [2506.20137v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20137v1)

 The ICARUS liquid argon TPC detector is taking data on the Booster (BNB) and Main Injector (NuMI) Neutrino beam lines at Fermilab with a trigger system based on the scintillation light produced by charged particles in coincidence with the proton beam extraction from the accelerators. The architecture and the deployment of the trigger system in the first two runs for physics are presented, as well as the triggered event rates. The event recognition efficiency has been evaluated as a function of the deposited energy and the position of cosmic muons stopping inside the detector.

2025-06-26, **The Kaleidoscope Survey: Strong Gravitational Lensing in Galaxy Clusters with Radial Arcs**, Catherine Cerny et.al., [2506.21531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21531v1)

 We measure the dark matter density profiles of six galaxy clusters: A383, MS 2137-23, MACS J0326.8-0043, MACS J1427.6-2521, MACS J0417.5-1154, and MACS J0949.8+1708. Each cluster contains at least one radial arc, a unique physical feature that allows for more precise measurements of the inner mass profile (R < 50 kpc) from strong lensing. We present the first strong lensing analysis for MACS J0326 and MACS J1427. We use a combination of HST imaging and VLT/MUSE observations from the ESO Kaleidoscope Clusters Survey, a large `filler' program, to identify and measure redshifts for multiply-imaged systems and obtain the 2-D stellar velocity dispersion for each centrally-located brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). The BCG kinematics are used to subtract the baryonic mass component from the inner mass profile. We find total mass density profiles consistent with previous works using a combination of strong lensing and BCG kinematics. The overall shape of these profiles appears core-like, with an average dark matter slope measurement of $\gamma$~0.66. These results demonstrate the ongoing need for the construction of observational models for galaxy clusters, and show how galaxy-scale kinematics can be used to disentangle baryonic and dark matter concentrations in cluster cores.

2025-06-26, **Quasar cosmology II: joint analyses with Cosmic Microwave Background**, M. Benetti et.al., [2506.21477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21477v1)

 Currently, the increasing availability of accurate cosmological probes leads to the emergence of tensions between data on the one hand and between theoretical predictions and direct observations on the other. Moreover, after 25 years since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has elected the $\Lambda$CDM model as the reference model, resolving shortcomings of the standard cosmological model seems to be an unpostponed priority. Hence, it is key to test alternative models and investigate new cosmological probes at distances that range from the late to the early Universe, namely between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) data. Bargiacchi et al. (2022) for the first time analysed dark energy (DE) models using quasars (QSOs) while also testing their consistency with BAO. Here, we carry on by exploring the compatibility of QSOs with both CMB data and dark energy survey measurements against the standard cosmological model and some DE extensions, such as the $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisations. We also consider an interacting dark matter and vacuum energy scenario, where vacuum energy perturbations affect the evolution of the matter growth rate in a decomposed Chaplygin gas model. We implement the QSO probe in Cobaya Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, using Botzmann solver codes as Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) for the theory predictions. Our work shows that simple DE deviations from $\Lambda$CDM model do not reconcile the data and that only more complex models of interaction in the dark sector can succeed in solving the discrepancies of probes at all scales.

2025-06-26, **Constraint on Momentum-coupled Dark Energy using DESI DR2**, Prasanta Sahoo et.al., [2506.21295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21295v1)

 In this work, we study two scalar field driven dark energy models characterized by the axion potential and the inverse power law potential, each coupled to dark matter through a momentum exchange interaction. By formulating the dynamics as an autonomous system, we identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. To constrain these models, we utilize observational data from Pantheon Plus Type Ia Supernovae, DES Y5, DESI DR2 BAO, and Planck 2018 CMB compressed likelihood, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both potentials exhibit weak to strong preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a particularly strong preference for the momentum-coupled scenario when Supernova data are included in the analysis. Furthermore, we find the coupling parameter to be negative, with no lower bound, for both potentials. This suggests that momentum-exchange coupling between the dark sectors cannot be ruled out. From the stability analysis, we observe that for both potentials, the late-time attractor corresponds to a dark energy dominated phase, and the scalar field can behave as a stiff fluid during the early epoch.

2025-06-26, **On the Dark-Energy Enigma**, Ali H. Chamseddine et.al., [2506.21099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21099v1)

 We present a model that offers an explanation for the presence of (Dark Matter and) Dark Energy in the universe. A key idea is to express the volume form of the Lorentzian metric on space-time in terms of a positive function of a new scalar field multiplying a certain four-form given by the wedge product of the differential of the mimetic scalar field and a certain closed three-form. An ansatz for this three-form related to one commonly used to determine the winding number of a map from a three-dimensional hypersurface to a three-sphere is discussed. An action functional depending on the space-time metric, the new scalar field, the mimetic scalar and the three-form is proposed, and the field equations are derived. Special solutions of these equations for a Friedmann-Lema\^itre universe are presented.

2025-06-26, **Statistical Strong Lensing as a Test of Conformal Gravity**, Li-Xue Yue et.al., [2506.21019v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21019v1)

 As an alternative gravitational theory to General Relativity (GR), Conformal Gravity (CG) can be verified through astronomical observations. Currently, Mannheim and Kazanas have provided vacuum solutions for cosmological and local gravitational systems, and these solutions may resolve the dark matter and dark energy issues encountered in GR, making them particularly valuable. For static, spherically symmetric systems, CG predicts an additional linear potential generated by luminous matter in addition to the conventional Newtonian potential. This extra potential is expected to account for the observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters without the need of dark matter. It is characterized by the parameter $\gamma^*$, which corresponds to the linear potential generated by the unit of the solar mass, and it is thus a universal constant. The value of $\gamma^\ast$ was determined by fitting the rotation curve data of spiral galaxies. These predictions of CG should also be verified by the observations of strong gravitational lensing. In this study, building upon the previous research, we tested CG via strong lensing statistics. We used a well-defined sample that consisted of both galaxies and galaxy clusters. This allowed us to test CG through statistical strong lensing in a way similar to the conventional approach in GR. As anticipated, our results were consistent with previous studies, namely that the fitted $\gamma^*$ is much larger than that from rotation curves. Intriguingly, we further discovered that, in order to fit the strong lensing data of another sample, the value of $\gamma^*$ cannot be a constant, as is required in CG. Instead, we derived a formula for $\gamma^*$ as a function of the stellar mass $M\_*$ of the galaxies or galaxy clusters. It was found that $\gamma^*$ decreases as $M\_*$ increases.

2025-06-25, **Dynamical friction and massive black hole orbits: analytical predictions and numerical solutions**, Alice Damiano et.al., [2506.20740v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20740v1)

 We investigate the orbital decay of a massive BH embedded in a dark matter halo and a stellar bulge, using both analytical and numerical simulations with the aim of developing and validating a reliable dynamical friction (DF) correction across simulation resolutions. We develop a Python-based library to solve the equations of motion of the BH and provide an analytical framework for the numerical results. Then, we carry out simulations at different resolutions and for different softening choices using the Tree-PM code OpenGADGET3, where we implement an improved DF correction based on a kernel-weighted local density estimation. Our results demonstrate that the DF correction significantly accelerates BH sinking and ensures convergence with increasing resolution, closely matching analytical predictions. We find that in low-resolution regimes - particularly when the BH mass is smaller than that of the background particles - our DF model still effectively controls BH dynamics. Contrary to expectations, the inclusion of a stellar bulge can delay sinking due to numerical heating, an effect partially mitigated by the DF correction. We conclude that our refined DF implementation provides a robust framework for modeling BH dynamics both in controlled simulation setups of galaxies and in large-scale cosmological simulations. This will be crucial for future simulation campaigns, to enable more accurate predictions of AGN accretion and feedback, and to estimate gravitational-wave event rates.

2025-06-25, **Exploring Fermionic Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars in the Light of Astrophysical Observations**, Payaswinee Arvikar et.al., [2506.20736v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20736v1)

 We studied the properties of dark matter admixed-neutron stars (DMANS), considering fermionic dark matter (DM) that interacts gravitationally with hadronic matter (HM). Using relativistic mean-field equations of state (EoSs) for both components, we solved the two-fluid Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) equations to determine neutron star (NS) properties assuming that DM is confined within the stellar core. For hadronic matter, we employed realistic EoSs derived from low energy nuclear physics experiments, heavy-ion collision data, and NS observations. To constrain key dark matter parameters such as particle mass, mass fraction, and the coupling to mass ratio, we applied Bayesian inference, incorporating various astrophysical data including mass, radii, and NICER mass-radius distributions for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451. Additionally, we explored the influence of high-density HM EoSs and examined the impact of stiffer hadronic EoSs, excluding the vector meson self-interaction term. Our findings indicate that current astrophysical observations primarily constrain the dark matter fraction, while providing limited constraints on the particle mass or coupling. However, the dark matter fraction is largely insensitive to how astrophysical observations or uncertainties in the high-density EoS are incorporated. Instead, it is predominantly determined by the stiffness of the hadronic EoS at high densities, with stiffer hadronic EoSs yielding a higher dark matter mass fraction. Therefore, we conclude that the dark matter fraction plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of DMANS. Future investigations incorporating more realistic EoSs and astrophysical observations of other compact objects may provide deeper insights into dark matter.

2025-06-25, **Dark Classification Matters: Searching for Primordial Black Holes with LSST**, Miguel Crispim Romao et.al., [2506.20709v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20709v1)

 We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.

2025-06-25, **Updated constraints on the primordial power spectrum at sub-Mpc scales**, Torsten Bringmann et.al., [2506.20704v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20704v1)

 The primordial power spectrum of matter density perturbations contains highly valuable information about new fundamental physics, in particular cosmological inflation, but is only very weakly constrained observationally for small cosmological scales $k\gtrsim 3\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We derive novel constraints, $\mathcal{P}\_\mathcal{R}(k)\lesssim 5\cdot10^{-6}$ over a large range of such scales, from the formation of ultracompact minihalos in the early universe. Unlike most existing constraints of this type, our results do not rest on the assumption that dark matter can annihilate into ordinary matter.

2025-06-25, **Cosmological bounds on dark matter annihilation using dark ages 21-cm signal**, Vivekanand Mohapatra et.al., [2506.20648v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20648v1)

 We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on the global 21-cm signal during the dark ages and cosmic dawn eras. The 21-cm line provides a complementary probe for studying the nature of dark matter beyond standard cosmological observables. In the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the expected absorption amplitude of the dark ages global 21-cm signal is approximately $-42\, \rm mK$. However, energy injection from DM annihilation can significantly heat and ionize the intergalactic medium, potentially altering or even erasing this absorption feature. We evaluate the thermal and ionization history of the gas to derive an upper bound on $f\_\chi^2 \langle \sigma v \rangle / M\_\chi$ using the dark ages signal, which is free from astrophysical uncertainties. After incorporating observational and theoretical uncertainties arising from future lunar-based experiments and variations in cosmological parameters, respectively -- we obtain a conservative upper limit of $f\_\chi^2\langle\sigma v\rangle/M\_\chi \lesssim 10^{-28}~\rm cm^3\,s^{-1}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. This constraint is nearly an order of magnitude stronger than the bounds derived from Planck 2018 data.

2025-06-25, **Cosmological abundance of primordial black holes in mixed dark matter scenarios incorporating Kaluza-Klein dark matter**, Yupeng Yang et.al., [2506.20391v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20391v1)

 The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m\_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M\_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M\_{\odot}$, are $f\_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.

 We investigate the production of dark matter in association with a Higgs boson at the LHC within the singlet fermionic dark matter model. We focus on final states featuring a Higgs boson accompanied by large missing transverse momentum ($E^{\textrm{miss}}\_{\textrm{T}}$), where the Higgs decays into a $b \bar{b}$ pair in the ATLAS analysis and into a $ZZ$ pair in the CMS analysis. Assuming light dark matter fermions with a mass of approximately 1 GeV, we find that the predicted production yields in this model are compatible with, or even exceed, those of the benchmark scenarios studied in the recent experimental analyses, particularly in the low $E^{\textrm{miss}}\_{\textrm{T}}$ region, under parameter sets allowed by current collider bounds and dark matter constraints. Therefore, we expect that some exclusion limits on the model parameters introduced in this work may be derived from existing ATLAS and CMS mono-Higgs search results, and that the mono-Higgs production in this model can be directly probed at the future High-Luminosity phase of the LHC.

 We revisit the Standard Model fit to electroweak precision observables in using the latest data and the Particle Data Group (PDG) measurement of the W boson mass. The analysis is then repeated in light of the new W boson mass measurement from the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) collaboration. We then introduce a dark photon to the model, placing constraints on the parameter space arising from these electroweak precision observables, both for the PDG and CDF values for the W boson mass. We also extend previous work by placing the first electroweak precision observable constraints on the coupling of dark photons to the fermionic dark matter sector.

 The lifetime of primordial black holes (PBHs), which were formed in the early universe, can be extended by the memory burden effect. Light PBHs may be in existence today and become a candidate for dark matter (DM). We assume that DM is made of thermally produced weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), WIMPs produced via Hawking radiation of PBHs, and survived PBHs via the memory burden effect. In addition, feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) are considered as an alternative to WIMPs. Various similar studies have been conducted either with or without considering the memory burden effect. In this study, we simultaneously account for thermally produced WIMPs or FIMPs and the memory burden effect of PBHs to explain the relic abundance of DM. We show that this abundance is highly sensitive to the memory burden effect in PBHs.

 We analyze the bipolar morphology of the jet-shaped core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) S147 and its neutron star (NS) kick velocity, and suggest that two pairs of unequal, opposite jets contributed to the NS kick velocity. This kick by early asymmetrical pairs (kick-BEAP) of jets mechanism operates within the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We examine the prominent pair of large ears and, based on their flat structure rather than the more common conical structure of ears, conclude that two pairs of jets close in angle inflated the two opposite ears. We connect two opposite X-ray bright zones by an additional axis to create the full point-symmetric morphology of CCSNR S147. We propose that the two unequal jets that formed the X-ray bright zones imparted the first kick-BEAP, while the two pairs of jets that formed the ears imparted the second kick-BEAP. The two kick velocities are of about equal magnitude of ~450 km/s, which implies very energetic jets. Such jets can excite gravitational waves that present detectors can detect from the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. We use the morphology we identify to estimate the CCSNR age at 23,000 yr. Our results strengthen the JJEM.

2025-06-26, **Quintessence and phantoms in light of DESI 2025**, Ioannis D. Gialamas et.al., [2506.21542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21542v1)

 We analyse DESI BAO, CMB, and supernova data to explore the physical origin of the DESI indication for dynamical dark energy. Beyond the standard CPL parametrization, we explore truncated alternatives and quintessence models. We conclude that there is compelling evidence for dark energy to be decaying in the late universe, but the evidence for a phantom behaviour is less significant. Models without phantom behaviour are compatible with the data at the $2\sigma$ CL. Furthermore, we examine a concrete quintessence scenario with a Higgs-like potential, allowing for a direct comparison with parametrized approaches and testing its consistency with current observations. This framework enables a broader investigation of late-time cosmic evolution and reveals a $93.8\%$ preference for a future transition into an anti-de Sitter space, which may ultimately lead to a cosmological collapse of our Universe.

 Currently, the increasing availability of accurate cosmological probes leads to the emergence of tensions between data on the one hand and between theoretical predictions and direct observations on the other. Moreover, after 25 years since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has elected the $\Lambda$CDM model as the reference model, resolving shortcomings of the standard cosmological model seems to be an unpostponed priority. Hence, it is key to test alternative models and investigate new cosmological probes at distances that range from the late to the early Universe, namely between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) data. Bargiacchi et al. (2022) for the first time analysed dark energy (DE) models using quasars (QSOs) while also testing their consistency with BAO. Here, we carry on by exploring the compatibility of QSOs with both CMB data and dark energy survey measurements against the standard cosmological model and some DE extensions, such as the $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisations. We also consider an interacting dark matter and vacuum energy scenario, where vacuum energy perturbations affect the evolution of the matter growth rate in a decomposed Chaplygin gas model. We implement the QSO probe in Cobaya Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, using Botzmann solver codes as Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) for the theory predictions. Our work shows that simple DE deviations from $\Lambda$CDM model do not reconcile the data and that only more complex models of interaction in the dark sector can succeed in solving the discrepancies of probes at all scales.

 An element's astrophysical origin should be reflected in the spatial distribution of its abundance, yielding measurably different spatial distributions for elements with different nucleosynthetic sites. However, most extragalactic multi-element analyses of gas-phase abundances to date have been limited to small numbers of sightlines, making statistical characterization of differences in spatial distributions of elements impossible. Here we use integrated field spectroscopic data covering the full face of the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 sampled at 3.5-pc resolution to produce maps of the abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur using independent direct methods. We find strong evidence for differences in the elements' spatial statistics that mirror their predicted nucleosynthetic origins: the spatial distributions of oxygen and sulfur, both predominantly produced in core-collapse supernovae, indicate that initial injection occurs on larger scales than for nitrogen, which is predominantly produced by asymptotic giant branch stars. All elements are well-correlated but oxygen and sulfur are much better correlated with each other than with nitrogen, consistent with recent results for stellar abundances in the Milky Way. These findings both open a new avenue to test nucleosynthetic models, and make predictions for the structure of stellar chemical abundance distributions.

2025-06-26, **Constraint on Momentum-coupled Dark Energy using DESI DR2**, Prasanta Sahoo et.al., [2506.21295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21295v1)

 In this work, we study two scalar field driven dark energy models characterized by the axion potential and the inverse power law potential, each coupled to dark matter through a momentum exchange interaction. By formulating the dynamics as an autonomous system, we identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. To constrain these models, we utilize observational data from Pantheon Plus Type Ia Supernovae, DES Y5, DESI DR2 BAO, and Planck 2018 CMB compressed likelihood, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both potentials exhibit weak to strong preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a particularly strong preference for the momentum-coupled scenario when Supernova data are included in the analysis. Furthermore, we find the coupling parameter to be negative, with no lower bound, for both potentials. This suggests that momentum-exchange coupling between the dark sectors cannot be ruled out. From the stability analysis, we observe that for both potentials, the late-time attractor corresponds to a dark energy dominated phase, and the scalar field can behave as a stiff fluid during the early epoch.

 In this study, we investigate the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of non-minimally coupled $f(Q,L\_m)$ gravity, where $Q$ is the non-metricity scalar and $L\_m$ is the matter Lagrangian. We derive modified Friedmann equations in a flat FLRW background and employ the \textit{Gong-Zhang} parameterization for the DE equation of state (EoS), allowing an analytical form of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. The model parameters are constrained using recent Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Pantheon+SH0ES Type Ia supernova datasets through MCMC-based chi-squared minimization. We analyze various cosmological quantities including the deceleration parameter, EoS, jerk, snap, lerk, and diagnostic tools such as $Om(z)$ and the statefinder pair $(r,s)$. Our findings indicate a viable transition from deceleration to acceleration and reveal a quintessence-to-phantom-like evolution of dark energy. Furthermore, energy conditions are examined, showing a violation of the strong energy condition, consistent with current cosmic acceleration. The results establish that the $f(Q,L\_m) $ framework with non-minimal coupling and parameterized EoS provides a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration.

2025-06-25, **The Importance of the Population III Initial Mass Function in Determining the Characteristics of the Earliest Galaxies**, Richard Sarmento et.al., [2506.20767v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20767v1)

 We use large-scale cosmological simulations to study the prospect of observing Population III (Pop III) bright galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). To quantify the impact of radiative transfer (RT), we compare a simulation that includes moment-based RT with one in which RT is handled approximately. Both simulations include a subgrid model of turbulent mixing, which is essential in tracking the formation of Pop III stars. We find that RT has a minor impact on our results and that the overall star formation rate densities for both simulations are in fair agreement with observations and other simulations. While our overall galaxy luminosity functions are consistent with current high-redshift observations, we predict a drop of a factor of at least 6 in detectable galaxy counts at $z = 14$ as compared to $z = 12$ at $M\_{ab}$ $\le$ -16. Modeling Pop III stars according to a lognormal, top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), we find that these stars contribute no more than about 1 percent of the flux of potentially detectable lensed galaxies at $z = 12$-14 with $M\_{ab} \le -15$. This is because a top-heavy Pop III IMF results in 99 percent of Pop III stellar mass being recycled within 10 Myr, well before the approx. 30 Myr timescale on which galaxies recover from supernova feedback and heating. These effects conspire to quickly extinguish Pop III star formation, making their detection difficult even for JWST.

2025-06-25, **Outflows from Star-Forming Galaxies in the Early Universe: Evolution from Double- to Single-Peaked Lyman-$ α$ Profiles Following Delayed Supernova Feedback**, James Nianias et.al., [2506.20422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20422v1)

 Lyman-$ \alpha $ emission, which owing to its resonant nature strongly couples the emergent line profile to gas kinematics, has become a key observable for probing outflows from star-forming galaxies in the early universe. Typically, Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles are explained in terms of idealised expanding shell models, while empirically-motivated interpretations of Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles that make use of comparisons with kinematics revealed by other spectral features (e.g. metal emission and absorption lines) are limited. Here, we analyse the kinematics of emission/absorption lines in the spectra of 338 gravitationally-lensed Lyman-$ \alpha $ sources revealed via blind spectroscopy of galaxy clusters with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Using metal emission lines to measure systemic redshifts, we confirm that the Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles are consistent with outflowing gas. In cases where interstellar metal absorption lines are detected, we find their kinematics and line ratios to be indicative of clumpy outflows. We investigate the differences between sources with single- and double-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles, finding the latter to drive weaker outflows yet show spectral signatures suggestive of younger stellar ages ($ < 4\,$Myr compared with $ > 20\,$Myr for sources with single-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles). We argue that double-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles may reflect weaker feedback in extremely young starbursts due to the delayed onset of supernova explosions. We also investigate whether outflow properties can be reliably inferred by fitting simple expanding shell models. We find that these models yield unphysical parameters in many cases even when they can reproduce the Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles to high precision, and urge caution when inferring outflow properties from such models.

2025-06-25, **Framework for phase transitions between the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions at finite temperature**, Constantinos Constantinou et.al., [2506.20418v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20418v1)

 The characteristics of the hadron-to-quark first-order phase transition differ depending on whether charge neutrality is locally or globally fulfilled. In $\beta$-equilibrated matter, these two possibilities correspond to the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions. Recently, we presented a new framework in which a continuously-varying parameter allows one to describe a first-order phase transition in intermediate scenarios to the two extremes of fully local and fully global charge neutrality. In this work, we extend the previous framework to finite temperatures and out-of-$\beta$ equilibrium conditions, making it available for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. We investigate its impact on key thermodynamic quantities across a range of baryon densities, temperatures, and electron fractions. We find that when matter is not in $\beta$-equilibrium, the pressure in the mixed phase is not constant even for the case of fully-local charge neutrality. Moreover, we compute the thermal index using three different approaches, demonstrating that the finite-temperature extension of an equation of state using a constant thermal index can be ill-defined when applied to the mixed phase.

2025-06-25, **Fine-Tuned Supernova or Failed Explosion? Decoding the Origins of the G3425 Binary**, Zsolt Regaly et.al., [2506.20386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20386v1)

 A binary system (G3425) consisting of a massive unseen component and a red giant star on a nearly circular orbit was recently discovered. The formation of such a system is puzzling because orbital stability generally breaks down due to the large mass loss from the system caused by the SN explosion while forming the unseen component. Analytical solutions of the variable-mass two-body problem suggest that the explosion should have occurred when the component was close to its apocenter to explain the near-circular remnant system. This provides a strong constraint on the total mass and orbital configuration of the progenitor system. The nearly circular orbit of G3425 rules out type II SN scenarios and allows only for a fine-tuned SN~Ib/c explosion to occur when the secondary was close to its apocenter. Such a scenario, although possible, is highly unlikely. However, the most likely scenario is a failed SN that produced a black hole, for which no additional constraints on the position of the secondary are needed. We propose that the unseen component of G3425 is a mass-gap black hole with a mass constrained between the theoretical minimum for failed supernova progenitors (4 MSun) and the observed upper limit (4.4 MSun). Our analysis can be applied to any wide binary system containing an unseen component on a nearly circular orbit.

 The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), as a pathfinder of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, is the first lobster-eye focusing X-ray telescope with a considerably large field-of-view (FoV) ever flown. During the two and half years of operations, a series of calibration observations were performed, to fully characterize its performance and calibrate the instrumental properties. In this paper, we present the results of the in-flight calibration campaign of LEIA, focusing on the properties of the PSF, source positional accuracy, effective area, energy response and the instrumental background. The calibration sources used are the Crab nebula, Sco X-1 and Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Specifically, it is found that the spatial resolution remains almost unchanged compared to the pre-launch values, ranging from 3.6'-9.3' with a median of 5.9'. The post-calibration source positional accuracy is found to be ~2' (at the 90% C.L.). The Crab spectra can be well reproduced by the absorbed power-law model with the best-fit parameters in large agreement with the literature values, indicating that the in-orbit effective area is overall consistent with the model predictions and ground measurements. The effective area exhibits a systematic of $\lesssim10\%$ (at the 68% C.L.), and a mild deterioration of ~15% at the lower energy end after one year of operation. The Cas A spectral analysis shows that the energy scale and spectral resolution of the detectors are generally consistent with ground values. The instrumental background is found to be largely consistent among the four detectors, with strong modulations by the geomagnetic activity and the spectrum qualitatively consistent with our previous simulations. These instrumental performances well meet the design requirements. This work paves the way for the in-orbit calibration of the EP-WXT.

2025-06-25, **Microquasar jet-cocoon systems as PeVatrons**, B. Theodore Zhang et.al., [2506.20193v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20193v1)

 The origin of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), particularly around the knee region ($\sim$3 PeV), remains a major unsolved question. Recent observations by LHAAASO suggest that the knee is shaped mainly by protons, with a transition to heavier elements at higher energies. Microquasars -- compact jet-emitting sources -- have emerged as possible PeV CR accelerators, especially after detections of ultrahigh-energy gamma rays from these systems. We propose that the observed proton spectrum (hard below a few PeV, steep beyond) arises from the reacceleration of sub-TeV Galactic CRs via shear acceleration in large-scale microquasar jet-cocoon structures. Our model also naturally explains the observed spectrum of energies around a few tens of PeV by summing up heavier nuclei contributions. Additionally, similar reacceleration processes in radio galaxies can contribute to ultrahigh-energy CRs, bridging Galactic and extragalactic origins. Combined with low-energy CRs from supernova remnants and galaxy clusters around the second knee region, this scenario could provide a unified explanation for CRs across the entire energy spectrum.

2025-06-25, **Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe. II: Lightcurve Analysis**, Kaustav K. Das et.al., [2506.20068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20068v1)

 The Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey yielded a sample of 330 Type IIP supernovae (SNe) with well-constrained peak luminosities. In paper I (arXiv:2502.19493), we measured their luminosity function and volumetric rate. Here (paper II), we present the largest systematic study of lightcurve properties for Type IIP SNe from a volume-limited survey, analyzing a selected subset of 129 events, including 16 low-luminosity Type IIP (LLIIP) SNe with M${r,peak} \geq -16$ mag. We find that plateau slope correlates with peak brightness, with many LLIIP SNe showing positive slopes--suggesting smaller progenitor radii and distinct density profiles compared to brighter Type IIP SNe. The plateau duration shows only a weak dependence on peak brightness, likely suggesting binary interaction. One SN exhibits a plateau-to-tail drop of >3.5 mag, consistent with an electron-capture or failed SN with very low or zero nickel mass. We derive explosion and progenitor parameters of the entire Type IIP SN sample using semi-analytical and radiation-hydrodynamical models. Based on radiation-hydrodynamical model fitting, LLIIP SNe are characterized by low nickel masses (0.001-0.025 $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$), low explosion energies (0.1-0.28 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), low ejecta masses ($8.1^{+0.8}\_{-1.7}$ $\mathrm{M\odot}$), and ZAMS masses below 11 $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$. In comparison, the full Type IIP SN sample spans a wider range with nickel masses (0.001-0.222 $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$), explosion energies (0.10-4.43 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), ejecta masses (5.4-24.8 $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$), and ZAMS masses (9.3-16.7 $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$). We find strong correlations between peak brightness, explosion energy, and nickel mass that extend to the low-luminosity end. We conclude that LLIIP SNe represent the faint, low-energy end of the Type IIP population and originate from the lowest-mass core-collapse progenitors.
