2024-06-13, **Final-state interactions in neutrino-induced proton knockout from argon in MicroBooNE**, A. Nikolakopoulos et.al., [2406.09244v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09244v1)

 Neutrino event generators make use of intranuclear cascade models (INCs), to predict the kinematics of hadrons produced in neutrino-nucleus interactions. We perform a consistent comparison of different INCs, by using the same set of events as input to the NEUT, NuWro, Achilles and INCL INCs. The inputs correspond to calculations of the fully differential single-proton knockout cross section, either in the distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA) or plane-wave impulse approximation (PWIA), both including realistic nuclear hole spectral functions. We compare the INC results to DWIA calculations with an optical potential, used extensively in the analysis of (e,e'p) experiments. We point out a systematic discrepancy between both approaches. We apply the INC results to recent MicroBooNE data. We assess the influence of the choice of spectral function, finding that large variations in realistic spectral functions are indistinguishable with present data. The data is underpredicted, with strength missing in the region where two-nucleon knockout and resonance production contribute. However, the data is underpredicted also in regions of low transverse missing momentum, where one-nucleon knockout dominates. The inclusion of the interference with two-body currents could lead to additional strength in this region.

2024-06-13, **MURCA driven Bulk viscosity in neutrino trapped baryonic matter**, Sreemoyee Sarkar et.al., [2406.08978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08978v1)

 We examine bulk viscosity, taking into account trapped neutrinos in baryonic matter, in the context of binary neutron star mergers. Following the merging event, the binary star can yield a remnant compact object with densities up to $5$ nuclear saturation density and temperature upto $50$ MeV resulting in the retention of neutrinos. We employ two relativistic mean field models, NL3 and DDME2, to describe the neutrino-trapped baryonic matter. The dissipation coefficient is determined by evaluating the Modified URCA interaction rate in the dense baryonic medium, and accounting for perturbations caused by density oscillations. We observe the resonant behavior of bulk viscosity as it varies with the temperature of the medium. The bulk viscosity peak remains within the temperature range of $\sim 13-50$ MeV, depending upon the underlying equation of states and lepton fractions. This temperature range corresponds to the relevant domain of binary neutron star mergers. We also note that in presence of neutrinos in the medium the bulk viscosity peak shifts towards higher temperature and the peak value of bulk viscosity also changes. The time scale of viscous dissipation is dictated by the beta-off-equilibrium susceptibilities derived from the nuclear equation of state. The resulting viscous decay time scale ranges from $32-100$ milliseconds, which aligns with the order of magnitude of the post-merger object's survival time in some specific scenarios.

2024-06-13, **Scotogenic gauge mechanism for neutrino mass and dark matter**, Phung Van Dong et.al., [2406.08752v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08752v1)

 Scotogenic is a scheme for neutrino mass generation through the one-loop contribution of an inert scalar doublet and three sterile neutrinos. This work argues that such inert scalar doublet is a Goldstone boson mode associated with a gauge symmetry breaking. Hence, the resultant scotogenic gauge mechanism is very predictive, generating neutrino mass as contributed by a new gauge boson doublet that eats such Goldstone bosons. The dark matter stability is manifestly ensured by a matter parity as residual gauge symmetry for which a vector dark matter candidate is hinted.

2024-06-13, **CMB bounds on primordial black holes with dark matter mini-halos: the role of radiative feedback**, Francesca Scarcella et.al., [2406.09269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09269v1)

 Observations of the cosmic microwave background constrain the abundance of primordial black holes, as these would accrete gas and inject energy into the cosmological medium. We have revisited these constraints, taking into account the local heating and ionisation of the gas around the black holes. While constraints for \textit{naked} black holes are not significantly affected, bounds including dark matter mini-halos are drastically relaxed. This result suggests that previous analysis may have significantly overestimated the role of dark matter mini-halos in boosting the accretion rates.

2024-06-13, **Acceleration of the Universe without the Hubble tension with Kaniadakis holographic dark energy using the Hubble horizon as the IR cut-off**, Wei Fang et.al., [2406.09209v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09209v1)

 We introduce a holographic dark energy model that incorporates the first-order approximate Kaniadaski entropy, utilizing the Hubble horizon, $1/H$, as the infrared cutoff. We investigate the cosmological evolution within this framework. The model introduces an extra parameter relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model. It posits a Universe that is initially dominated by dark matter, which then evolves to a phase where dark energy becomes the predominant component, with this transition occurring at a redshift of approximately $z \sim 0.419$. The energy density of dark energy is ultimately expected to become constant, thereby circumventing the potential issue of a "big rip". Employing the most recent Type Ia supernova and Hubble parameter data, we constrain the model's parameters and find a Hubble constant of $H\_0=72.8$ km/s/Mpc, thereby resolving the Hubble tension issue. The estimated age of the Universe, based on the best-fit parameter values, is $14.2$ Gyr. Furthermore, we predict the number of strong gravitational lenses and conduct statefinder and $Om$ diagnostic analyses to validate and characterize the model.

2024-06-13, **AuriDESI: Mock Catalogues for the DESI Milky Way Survey**, Namitha Kizhuprakkat et.al., [2406.08921v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08921v1)

 The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Milky Way Survey (DESI MWS) will explore the assembly history of the Milky Way by characterising remnants of ancient dwarf galaxy accretion events and improving constraints on the distribution of dark matter in the outer halo. We present mock catalogues that reproduce the selection criteria of MWS and the format of the final MWS data set. These catalogues can be used to test methods for quantifying the properties of stellar halo substructure and reconstructing the Milky Way's accretion history with the MWS data, including the effects of halo-to-halo variance. The mock catalogues are based on a phase-space kernel expansion technique applied to star particles in the Auriga suite of six high-resolution $\Lambda$CDM magneto-hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations. They include photometric properties (and associated errors) used in DESI target selection and the outputs of the MWS spectral analysis pipeline (radial velocity, metallicity, surface gravity, and temperature). They also include information from the underlying simulation, such as the total gravitational potential and information on the progenitors of accreted halo stars. We discuss how the subset of halo stars observable by MWS in these simulations corresponds to their true content and properties. These mock Milky Ways have rich accretion histories, resulting in a large number of substructures that span the whole stellar halo out to large distances and have substantial overlap in the space of orbital energy and angular momentum.

2024-06-13, **Testing MOND using the dynamics of nearby stellar streams**, Orlin Koop et.al., [2406.08872v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08872v1)

 The stellar halo of the Milky Way is built up, at least in part, from debris from past mergers. Stars from such merger events define substructures in phase-space, for example in the form of streams, which are groups of stars moving on similar trajectories. The nearby Helmi streams discovered more than two decades ago are a well-known example. Using 6D phase-space information from the Gaia space mission, Dodd et al. (2022) have recently reported that the Helmi streams are split into two clumps in angular momentum space. Such substructure can be explained and sustained in time if the dark matter halo of the Milky Way takes a prolate shape in the region probed by the orbits of the stars in the streams. Here, we explore the behaviour of the two clumps identified in the Helmi streams in a Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) framework to test this alternative model of gravity. We perform orbit integrations of Helmi streams member stars in a simplified MOND model of the Milky Way and using the more sophisticated Phantom of RAMSES simulation framework. We find with both approaches that the two Helmi streams clumps do not retain their identity and dissolve after merely 100 Myr. This extremely short timescale would render the detection of two separate clumps as very unlikely in MONDian gravity. The observational constraints provided by the streams, which MOND fails to reproduce in its current formulation, could potentially also be used to test other alternative gravity models.

2024-06-13, **Exponential gravity with logarithmic corrections in the presence of axion dark matter**, Sergei D. Odintsov et.al., [2406.08831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08831v1)

 An exponential modified gravity with additional logarithmic corrections is considered with the presence of an axion-like scalar field in the role of dark matter. Axion fields are thought to become important at late-times when the axion-like scalar field oscillates around its vacuum expectation value, mimicking dark matter behaviour. The model is compared with the usual pressureless fluid description of dark matter. Both models are tested with observational data including some of the latest sources, providing similar fits in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Despite results are not statistically relevant to rule out any model, the number of free parameters still favours $\Lambda$CDM model, as shown by computing the goodness of the fits.

2024-06-13, **Primordial magnetic relics and their signatures**, Arka Banerjee et.al., [2406.08728v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08728v1)

 Primordial black holes bearing magnetic charges may bypass the constraints imposed by Hawking radiation, thereby enabling reasonable present-day populations, even for masses below $10^{15}\,\text{g}$ -- a range previously considered improbable. They could, therefore, conceivably contribute to a component of dark matter. We investigate novel Faraday rotation signatures exhibited by primordial magnetic black holes while also establishing new Parker-type bounds on their populations. For the latter, we bound the dark matter fraction from intergalactic magnetic fields in cosmic voids $\left(f\_{\text{DM}} \lesssim 10^{-8}\right)$ and cosmic web filaments $\left(f\_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-4}\right)$, notably eclipsing previous bounds. Exploring Faraday rotation effects, we discern a pronounced rotation of the polarization angle and the rotation measure values for extremal primordial magnetic black holes with masses $M^{\text{ ex.}}\_{\text{ BH}}\gtrsim 10^{-6}~ \text{M}\_\odot$. This makes them potentially detectable in current observations. A comparative investigation finds that the effects are notably greater than for a neutron star, like a Magnetar, with a similar magnetic field at the surface. Moreover, the polarization angle maps for primordial magnetic black holes exhibit unique features, notably absent in other astrophysical magnetic configurations. In this context, we also introduce a simple integral measure, offering a quantitative measure for their discrimination in many scenarios. These traits potentially suggest a robust avenue for their observational detection and differentiation.

2024-06-13, **QCD constraints on isospin-dense matter and the nuclear equation of state**, Ryan Abbott et.al., [2406.09273v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09273v1)

 Understanding the behavior of dense hadronic matter is a central goal in nuclear physics as it governs the nature and dynamics of astrophysical objects such as supernovae and neutron stars. Because of the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), little is known rigorously about hadronic matter in these extreme conditions. Here, lattice QCD calculations are used to compute thermodynamic quantities and the equation of state of QCD over a wide range of isospin chemical potentials. Agreement is seen with chiral perturbation theory predictions when the chemical potential is small. Comparison to perturbative QCD calculations at large chemical potential allows for an estimate of the gap in the superconducting phase, and this quantity is seen to agree with perturbative determinations. Since the partition function for an isospin chemical potential, $\mu\_I$, bounds the partition function for a baryon chemical potential $\mu\_B=3/2\mu\_I$, these calculations also provide rigorous non-perturbative QCD bounds on the nuclear equation of state over a wide range of baryon densities for the first time.

2024-06-13, **Discovery and Extensive Follow-Up of SN 2024ggi, a nearby type IIP supernova in NGC 3621**, Ting-Wan Chen et.al., [2406.09270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09270v1)

 We present the discovery and early observations of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi in NGC 3621 at 6.64 +/- 0.3 Mpc. The SN was caught 5.8 (+1.9 -2.9) hours after its explosion by the ATLAS survey. Early-phase, high-cadence, and multi-band photometric follow-up was performed by the Kinder (Kilonova Finder) project, collecting over 1000 photometric data points within a week. The combined o- and r-band light curves show a rapid rise of 3.3 magnitudes in 13.7 hours, much faster than SN 2023ixf (another recent, nearby, and well-observed SN II). Between 13.8 and 18.8 hours after explosion SN 2024ggi became bluer, with u-g colour dropping from 0.53 to 0.15 mag. The rapid blueward evolution indicates a wind shock breakout (SBO) scenario. No hour-long brightening expected for the SBO from a bare stellar surface was detected during our observations. The classification spectrum, taken 17 hours after the SN explosion, shows flash features of high-ionization species such as Balmer lines, He I, C III, and N III. Detailed light curve modeling reveals critical insights into the properties of the circumstellar material (CSM). Our favoured model has an explosion energy of 2 x 10^51 erg, a mass-loss rate of 10^-3 solar\_mass/yr (with an assumed 10 km/s wind), and a confined CSM radius of 6 x 10^14 cm. The corresponding CSM mass is 0.4 solar\_mass. Comparisons with SN 2023ixf highlight that SN 2024ggi has a smaller CSM density, resulting in a faster rise and fainter UV flux. The extensive dataset and the involvement of citizen astronomers underscore that a collaborative network is essential for SBO searches, leading to more precise and comprehensive SN characterizations.

2024-06-13, **Strong gravitational lenses from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory**, Anowar J. Shajib et.al., [2406.08919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08919v1)

 Like many areas of astrophysics and cosmology, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be transformational for almost all the applications of strong lensing, thanks to the dramatic increase in the number of known strong lenses by two orders of magnitude or more and the readily available time-domain data for the lenses with transient sources. In this article, we provide an overview of the forecasted number of discovered lenses of different types and describe the primary science cases these large lens samples will enable. We provide an updated forecast on the joint constraint for the dark energy equation-of-state parameters, $w\_0$ and $w\_a$, from combining all strong lensing probes of dark energy. We update the previous forecast from the Rubin Observatory Dark Energy Science Collaboration's Science Review Document by adding two new crucial strong lensing samples: lensed Type Ia supernovae and single-deflector lenses with measured stellar kinematics. Finally, we describe the current and near-future activities and collaborative efforts within the strong lensing community in preparation for the arrival of the first real dataset from Rubin in early 2026.
