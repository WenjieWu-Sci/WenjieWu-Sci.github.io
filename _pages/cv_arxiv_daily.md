2024-04-15, **Neutrino dipole portal at a high energy $Î¼-$collider**, Daniele Barducci et.al., [2404.09609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09609v1)

 We study the phenomenology of $d=6$ dipole portal operators connecting active and sterile neutrinos at a futuristic muon collider. These operators can be the dominant portal between the Standard Model and the New Physics sector in scenarios in which the active-sterile mixing is suppressed. We identify two production modes for sterile neutrinos: one proceeding through the exchange of an $s-$channel electroweak boson and one arising from the fusion of an electroweak boson with a Standard Model lepton. We study the expected reach on the operators suppression scale for these different production mechanisms, showing that the latter offers the best sensitivity and allowing to test a New Physics scale in the $\sim 10\;$TeV range.

2024-04-15, **Deep Learning for Cosmological Parameter Inference from Dark Matter Halo Density Field**, Zhiwei Min et.al., [2404.09483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09483v1)

 We propose a lightweight deep convolutional neural network (lCNN) to estimate cosmological parameters from simulated three-dimensional DM halo distributions and associated statistics. The training dataset comprises 2000 realizations of a cubic box with a side length of 1000 $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, and interpolated over a cubic grid of $300^3$ voxels, with each simulation produced using $512^3$ DM particles and $512^3$ neutrinos . Under the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, simulations vary standard six cosmological parameters including $\Omega\_m$, $\Omega\_b$, $h$, $n\_s$, $\sigma\_8$, $w$, along with the neutrino mass sum, $M\_\nu$. We find that: 1) within the framework of lCNN, extracting large-scale structure information is more efficient from the halo density field compared to relying on the statistical quantities including the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, and the coefficients from wavelet scattering transform; 2) combining the halo density field with its Fourier transformed counterpart enhances predictions, while augmenting the training dataset with measured statistics further improves performance; 3) achieving high accuracy in inferring $\Omega\_m$, $h$, $n\_s$, and $\sigma\_8$ by the neural network model, while being inefficient in predicting $\Omega\_b$,$M\_\nu$ and $w$; 4) compared to the simple random forest network trained with three statistical quantities, lCNN yields unbiased estimations with reduced statistical errors: approximately 33.3\% for $\Omega\_m$, 20.0\% for $h$, 8.3\% for $n\_s$, and 40.0\% for $\sigma\_8$. Our study emphasizes this lCNN-based novel approach in extracting large-scale structure information and estimating cosmological parameters.

2024-04-15, **Using Micromegas detectors for direct dark matter searches: challenges and perspectives**, K. Altenmueller et.al., [2404.09727v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09727v1)

 Gas time projection chambers (TPCs) with Micromegas pixelated readouts are being used in dark matter searches and other rare event searches, due to their potential in terms of low background levels, energy and spatial resolution, gain, and operational stability. Moreover, these detectors can provide precious features,such as topological information, allowing for event directionality and powerful signal-background discrimination. The Micromegas technology of the microbulk type is particularly suited to low-background applications and is being exploited by detectors for CAST and IAXO (solar axions) and TREX-DM (low-mass WIMPs) experiments. Challenges for the future include reducing intrinsic background levels, reaching lower energy detection levels, and technical issues such as robustness of detector, new design choices, novel gas mixtures and operation points, scaling up to larger detector sizes, handling large readout granularity, etc. We report on the status and prospects of the development ongoing in the context of IAXO and TREX-DM experiments, pointing to promising perspectives for the use of Micromegas detectors in directdark matter searches

2024-04-15, **Astrochemistry of the molecular gas in Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies at the Cosmic Noon**, Francesca Perrotta et.al., [2404.09673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09673v1)

 FIR and submm observations have established the fundamental role of dust-obscured star formation in the assembly of stellar mass over the past 12 billion years. At z between 2 and 4, the bulk of star formation is enshrouded in dust, and dusty star forming galaxies (DSFGs) contain about half of the total stellar mass density. Star formation develops in dense molecular clouds, and is regulated by a complex interplay between all the ISM components that contribute to the energy budget of a galaxy: gas, dust, cosmic rays, interstellar electromagnetic fields, gravitational field, dark matter. Molecular gas is the actual link between star forming gas and its complex environment, providing by far the richest amount of information about the star formation process. However, molecular lines interpretation requires complex modeling of astrochemical networks, which regulate the molecular formation and establishes molecular abundances in a cloud, and a modeling of the physical conditions of the gas in which molecular energy levels become populated. This paper critically reviews the main astrochemical parameters needed to get predictions about molecular signals in DSFGs. We review the current knowledge and the open questions about the interstellar medium of DSFGs, outlying the key role of molecular gas as a tracer and shaper of the star formation process.

2024-04-15, **Millimeter-wave CO and SiO Observations toward the Broad-velocity-width Molecular Feature CO 16.134-0.553: a Smith cloud scenario?**, Hiroki Yokozuka et.al., [2404.09670v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09670v1)

 We report the results of the CO $\textit J$=1-0 and SiO $\textit J$=2-1 mapping observations towards the broad-velocity-width molecular feature CO 16.134-0.553 with the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m telescope. The high quality CO map shows that the 5-pc size broad-velocity-width feature bridges two separate velocity components at $\textit V\_{\rm{LSR}}$$\quad$$\simeq$ 40 km s$^{-1}$ and 65 km s$^{-1}$ in the position-velocity space. The kinetic power of CO 16.134-0.553 amounts to $7.8\times10^2$ $\textit L$$\_\odot$ whereas no apparent driving sources were identified. Prominent SiO emission was detected from the broad-velocity-width feature and its root in the $\textit V\_{\rm{LSR}}$$\quad$$\simeq$ 40 km s$^{-1}$ component. In the CO Galactic plane survey data, CO 16.134-0.553 appears to correspond to the Galactic eastern rim of a 15-pc diameter expanding CO shell. An $1\deg$-diameter H I emission void and $4\deg$-long vertical H I filament were also found above and below the CO shell, respectively. We propose that the high-velocity plunge of a dark matter subhalo with a clump of baryonic matter was responsible for the formation of the H I void, CO 16.134-0.553/CO shell, and the H I filament.

2024-04-14, **Disentangling modified gravity from a dark force with gravitational redshift**, Sveva Castello et.al., [2404.09379v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09379v1)

 The standard approach to test for deviations from General Relativity on cosmological scales is to combine measurements of the growth rate of structure with gravitational lensing. In this study, we show that this method suffers from an important limitation with regard to these two probes: models of dark matter with additional interactions can lead to the very same observational signatures found in modified gravity (and viceversa). Using synthetic data of redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background, we demonstrate that this degeneracy is inevitable between modifications of gravity and a dark fifth force. We then show that the coming generation of surveys, in particular the Square Kilometer Array, will allow us to break the degeneracy between such models through measurements of gravitational redshift. Performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the synthetic data set, we quantify the extent to which gravitational redshift can distinguish between two representative classes of models, Generalized Brans-Dicke (modified gravity) and Coupled Quintessence (fifth force).

2024-04-15, **The "C": The large Chameleon-Musca-Coalsack cloud**, Gordian Edenhofer et.al., [2404.09592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09592v1)

 Recent advancements in 3D dust mapping have transformed our understanding of the Milky Way's local interstellar medium (ISM), enabling us to explore its structure in three spatial dimensions for the first time. In this letter, we use the Edenhofer et al. (2023) 3D dust map to study the well-known Chameleon, Musca, and Coalsack cloud complexes, located about 200 pc from the Sun. We find that these three complexes are not isolated but rather connect to form a surprisingly well-defined half-ring, constituting a single "C"-shaped cloud with a radius of about 50 pc, a thickness of about 45 pc, and a total mass of about $9 \times 10^{4}~\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$. Despite the absence of an evident feedback source at its center, the dynamics of young stellar clusters associated with the "C" structure suggest that a single supernova explosion about 4 Myr to 10 Myr ago likely shaped this structure. Our findings support a single origin story for these cloud complexes, suggesting that they were formed by feedback-driven gas compression. This interpretation challenges scenarios in which magnetic fields are the primary drivers behind the formation of star-forming molecular clouds in this region, offering new insights into the processes that govern the birth of star-forming clouds in feedback-dominated regions, such as Sco-Cen.

2024-04-14, **The Timescales of Star Cluster Emergence: The Case of NGC 4449**, Timothy McQuaid et.al., [2404.09112v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09112v1)

 We survey the young star cluster population in the dwarf galaxy NGC4449 with the goal of investigating how stellar feedback may depend on the clusters' properties. Using Ultraviolet(UV)-optical-NearIR(NIR) photometry obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have recovered 99 compact sources exhibiting emission in the Pa$\beta$ hydrogen recombination line. Our analysis reveals these sources possess masses $10^{2}<M\_{\odot}<10^{5}$, ages 1-20 Myr, and color excess E(B - V) in the range 0-1.4. After selecting clusters with mass above 3,000M$\_{\odot}$ to mitigate stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function, we find that our IR-selected clusters have a median mass of $\sim$7$\times{10^{3}\text{ M}\_{\odot}}$ and remain embedded in their surrounding gas and dust for 5-6 Myr. In contrast, line-emitting sources selected from existing UV/optically catalogs have a median mass of $\sim$3.5$\times{10^{4}\text{ M}\_{\odot}}$ and have cleared their surroundings by 4 Myr. We further find that the environment in NGC4449 is too low pressure to drive these differences. We interpret these findings as evidence that the clearing timescale from pre-supernova and supernova feedback is cluster mass-dependent. Even in clusters with mass$\sim$7,000~M$\_{\odot}$, stochastic sampling of the upper end of the stellar initial mass function is present, randomly decreasing the number of massive stars available to inject energy and momentum into the surrounding medium. This effect may increase the clearing timescales in these clusters by decreasing the effectiveness of both pre-supernova and supernova feedback; neither models nor observations have so far explored such dependence explicitly. Future studies and observations with, e.g., the JWST, will fill this gap.
