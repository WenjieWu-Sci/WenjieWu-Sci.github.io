2025-11-05, **X-Ray Observations of Old Nearby Supernovae: Constraints on Compact Object Populations and Late Interaction**, Julia Ahlvind et.al., [2511.03539v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03539v1)

 The properties of the population of compact objects created in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are uncertain. X-ray observations years to decades after the explosions offer a way to gain insight into this, as hard X-ray emission from the central regions will emerge as the ejecta absorption decreases. Here we analyze and place upper limits on late-time X-ray emission in 242 nearby SNe, using 607 observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR. We use absorption models based on 3D simulations of neutrino-driven explosions to account for absorption of emission from the compact objects by the asymmetric ejecta. We detect X-ray emission from 12 SNe, including four for the first time (SN 1982R, SN 1984J, SN 1992bu, and SN 2003gk), and several of the others at later epochs than before. The X-ray spectra of these SNe are consistent with interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM), with the possible exception of SN 1979C, which shows an additional hard component, as also noted in previous studies at earlier epochs. This emission may be due to a pulsar wind nebula. Using the upper limits in the full sample, we also perform a population synthesis to constrain the fraction of SNe that produce pulsars and the properties of the pulsars themselves. We find that pulsar populations with mean initial spin periods $\gtrsim100\rm~ ms$ are favored. Finally, we note that the high luminosities of several of the SNe with CSM interaction imply interactions with dense shells.

2025-11-05, **First Associated Neutrino Search for a Failed Supernova Candidate with Super-Kamiokande**, F. Nakanishi et.al., [2511.03470v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03470v2)

 In 2024, a failed supernova candidate, M31-2014-DS1, was reported in the Andromeda galaxy (M31), located at a distance of approximately 770 kpc. In this paper, we search for neutrinos from this failed supernova using data from Super-Kamiokande (SK). Based on the estimated time of black hole formation inferred from optical and infrared observations, we define a search window for neutrino events in the SK data. Using this window, we develop a dedicated analysis method for failed supernovae and apply it to M31-2014-DS1, by conducting a cluster search using the timing and energy information of candidate events. No significant neutrino excess is observed within the search region. Consequently, we place an upper limit on the electron antineutrino luminosity from M31-2014-DS1 and discuss its implications for various failed SN models and their neutrino emission characteristics. Despite the 18 MeV threshold adopted to suppress backgrounds, the search remains sufficiently sensitive to constrain the Shen-TM1 EOS, yielding a 90% confidence level upper limit of 1.76 \times 10^{53} erg on the electron antineutrino luminosity, slightly above the expected value of 1.35 \times 10^{53} erg.

2025-11-05, **Deflection of Massive Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Particles around Kerr Black Hole**, Haida Li et.al., [2511.03451v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03451v1)

 The exact measurement of neutrino mass remains a longstanding issue. So far, there has been much success in providing an upper bound for the neutrino rest mass, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, by exploring the critical radius of a beam of polarized quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle deflecting around a classical Kerr black hole, we attempt to provide an additional testing ground for neutrino mass, as well as the mass of other proposed ultra-light particles yet to be determined. Notably, the quantum Dirac equation is used to derive a MPD-like equation satisfied by the polarized beam of massive spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles and identify the effective spin in the spin tensor with the particle's intrinsic quantum spin, confirming the previous theoretical result that the MPD equation can be in fact applied to particles' intrinsic spin. The result of this work shows that corrections of relative magnitude $>10^{-12}$ can be achieved for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles with rest mass equal to $1 eV/c^2$ deflecting around a solar mass Kerr black hole. Although highly theoretical, a new method of extracting the lower bound for the neutrino mass individually is also proposed due to the behavior of the quantum spin correction.

2025-11-05, **CP asymmetry factor in decays at finite temperature**, Károly Seller et.al., [2511.03445v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03445v1)

 We present in the conventional equilibrium approach to leptogenesis the complete leading order prediction for the CP asymmetry factor in finite-temperature decays involving Majorana neutrinos. As thermal effects are generally not negligible, the knowledge of the high temperature behavior of the underlying particle physics model, in particular that of mass generation, is required for reliable estimates of matter-antimatter asymmetry through the mechanism of leptogenesis. We present all necessary information needed to obtain the full one-loop evaluation for the thermal CP asymmetry factors for the processes $N\_i\to \phi + L$ and $\phi \to N\_i+L$ at temperatures where they are kinematically allowed. We present a numerical comparison with previous formulae given in the literature.

2025-11-05, **Design and Implementation of the Fast Data Processing System for the Baikal-GVD Neutrino Telescope**, V. A. Allakhverdyan et.al., [2511.03438v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03438v1)

 We present a fast data processing system for the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope, designed for rapid identification of astrophysical neutrino events. Leveraging Baikal-GVD's modular cluster architecture, the system implements parallelized file processing where raw data files undergo concurrent analysis across dedicated virtual machines. The system implements two pipelines: a fast per-file processing and a fully fledged (per-run) processing, which integrates dynamic detector geometry determined from acoustic and inertial positioning systems and data quality monitoring with a latency of about 27 hr. The fast processing pipeline delivers a total latency of about 1.5-18 minutes from event detection to reconstructed data availability, depending on water luminescence levels. This enables fast follow-up observations of transient astrophysical sources, fulfilling Baikal-GVD's role in multi-messenger networks. The article also highlights key features of the data acquisition system, the integration of advanced synchronization systems and a robust infrastructure for data handling and storage, ensuring efficient and reliable operation of the Baikal-GVD telescope.

2025-11-05, **Design and development of optical modules for the BUTTON-30 detector**, D. S. Bhattacharya et.al., [2511.03417v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03417v1)

 BUTTON-30 is a neutrino detector demonstrator located in the STFC Boulby underground facility in the north-east of England. The main goal of the project is to deploy and test the performance of the gadolinium-loaded water-based liquid scintillator for neutrino detection in an underground environment. This will pave the way for a future large-volume neutrino observatory that can also perform remote monitoring of nuclear reactors for nonproliferation. This paper describes the design and construction of the watertight optical modules of the experiment.

2025-11-05, **Test of the GENIE neutrino event generator against ${}^{16}$O $(e,e'p)$ data: Reduced cross section**, A. V. Butkevich et.al., [2511.03274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03274v1)

 The reduced cross section of the semiexclusive $(l,l'p)$ lepton scat tering process irrespective of the type of interaction is determined mainly by bound nucleon momentum distribution in target and nucleon final state interaction with residual nucleus. These cross sections can be identified with distorted nuclear spectral functions and therefore are similar up to Coulomb c orrections for neutrino and electron scattering on nuclei. In this article we exploit this similarity and use data with precise kinematics and large statistics for semiexclusive electron scattering on oxygen target to test models employed in the GENIE neutrino event generator. We find that these models can not reproduce well the measured reduced cross sections in all allowed kinematic region and the GENIE event generator needs to better describe both the nuclear ground states and nucleon final state interaction. The approach presented in this paper provides a great opportunity to test better the accuracy of nuclear models of quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, employed in neutrino event generators.

2025-11-05, **Development of a Hermetic Gaseous Xenon Detector for Suppressing External Radon Background**, Ryuta Miyata et.al., [2511.03250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03250v1)

 Radon-induced backgrounds, particularly from $^{222}$Rn and its beta-emitting progeny, present a critical challenge for next-generation liquid xenon (LXe) detectors aimed at probing dark matter down to the neutrino fog. To address this, we developed a compact hermetic gaseous xenon (GXe) detector. This device physically isolates the active volume from external radon sources by using a PTFE vessel sealed between two quartz flanges with mechanically compressed ePTFE gaskets. To quantify radon sealing performance, we implemented a dual-loop GXe circulation system and conducted a 670-hour radon-injection measurement campaign. Radon ingress into the hermetic detector was monitored using electrostatic radon detectors and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). From these two independent measurements, the steady-state ratios of the radon concentrations inside the hermetic detector to those outside were estimated to be $ (1.1 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{-2} $ and $ (1.1 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-2} $, corresponding to radon-leakage flows of $ (2.9 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-11} $ and $ (2.6 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-11} $ $ \thinspace $m$^{3}$ $ \thinspace $ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, respectively. An extrapolation to a 60-tonne LXe TPC such as XLZD suggests that the radon leakage could amount to $ 1.2 \times 10^{-2} $ $ \thinspace $mBq, which is negligible compared to the expected natural radon emanation inside the detector, typically 3$ \thinspace $mBq. These results demonstrate that flange-based mechanical sealing provides an effective solution for realizing radon-isolated inner detectors in large-scale LXe experiments.

2025-11-05, **Stellar Bounds on Light Spin-2 Particles in Bimetric Theories**, Camilo García-Cely et.al., [2511.03707v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03707v1)

 Using the bimetric formalism, we compute the production and emission rates of light spin-2 particles in non-degenerate stellar interiors through photoproduction and bremsstrahlung processes, including the effects of plasma screening. By comparing the resulting energy-loss rates with observational limits on stellar cooling, we derive bounds on the coupling strength and mass of the spin-2 particle. Assuming these particles are the dark matter of the Universe, the obtained constraints are competitive with existing astrophysical and cosmological limits, excluding a wide region of parameter space in the mass range 5-30 eV.

2025-11-05, **Two-loop form factors for Dark Matter annihilation to colored Standard Model particles**, Warsimakram Katapur et.al., [2511.03701v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03701v1)

 We investigate a UV-complete model in which the dark matter (DM) particle interacts with gluons through a colored scalar mediator. This framework provides a phenomenologically viable scenario testable at hadron colliders. While mono-jet signatures are relevant for collider searches, zero-jet processes correspond to complete annihilation of Standard Model (SM) particles into DM, contributing to the relic density. In this work, we study dark matter annihilation into SM colored particles, which in our model arises at leading order from loop-induced processes. We compute the relevant two-loop QCD amplitudes for both gluon and quark channels in dark matter production or annihilation. The amplitudes are decomposed into scalar form factors using the projector technique. Using integration-by-parts (IBP) identities, we obtain analytical expressions for the form factors in terms of master integrals. Ultraviolet divergences are removed via counterterm renormalization, yielding UV-finite results. These results would enable predictions for dark matter production or annihilation into SM colored particles at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD.

2025-11-05, **Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo I:Existence of Homoclinic Orbit and Near-Horizon Chaos**, Surajit Das et.al., [2511.03657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03657v1)

 We study the existence of homoclinic orbit and the onset of chaotic motion for a massive particle moving around a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) type dark matter halo, within the extreme-mass-ratio limit q = m/M << 1, where m and M are the masses of the particle and the central black hole, respectively. The presence of the halo modifies the spacetime curvature and consequently deforms the effective potential governing the particle's motion. Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the conditions under which unstable circular orbit and the associated homoclinic trajectory arise, marking the separatrix between bound and plunging motion. By analyzing the effective potential and the corresponding phase-space structure, we identify the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the near-horizon region. Numerical analyses through Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents calculations demonstrate that increasing the halo density, scale radius along with energy amplifies nonlinear effects which leads to chaos eventually. We demonstrate that within a dark matter halo environment, the dynamical stability of particle motion can be significantly altered without violating the universal surface gravity bound on chaos. This work provides a deeper understanding of horizon-induced chaos in astrophysically realistic environments and serves as a theoretical basis for exploring its possible imprints on gravitational wave signals in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals system.

2025-11-05, **High-Q Superconducting Lumped-Element Resonators for Low-Mass Axion Searches**, Roman Kolevatov et.al., [2511.03639v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03639v1)

 Low-frequency superconducting lumped-element resonators have recently attracted significant attention in the context of axion dark matter searches. Here we present the design and implementation of a fixed-frequency superconducting resonator operating near $250~\mathrm{kHz}$, possessing an inductor volume of $\sim 1$ liter and achieving an unloaded quality factor $Q \approx 2.1\times10^{6}$. This resonator represents a significant improvement over the state of the art and informs the design of searches for low-mass axions.

2025-11-05, **Living on the edge. A quantitative warning on boundary artifacts in the IllustrisTNG**, Ana Mitrašinović et.al., [2511.03562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03562v1)

 Periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are a practical necessity in cosmological simulations, but they can also introduce numerical artifacts. We quantified the prevalence of PBC-related artifacts in the IllustrisTNG using dark-matter-deprived galaxies (DMDGs) as tracers. We found that their occurrence scales inversely with simulation volume. We demonstrated that this excess population is spatially correlated with the box edges; the smallest TNG50 box is most affected by these problems. This is a unique and irreplaceable resource for studying galaxy structure. Manual inspection confirmed abrupt, unphysical mass-loss events coincident with boundary crossings. We also highlight the challenge of disentangling numerical artifacts from genuine tidally stripped galaxies in boundary-crossing clusters in TNG100. We conclude by recommending a set of mandatory sanity checks that include positional verification, mass history analysis, and even exclusion of the buffer zone near the edges. These strategies ensure the robustness of the scientific results derived from these invaluable simulations.

2025-11-05, **Dark-Matter-Powered Population III Evolution: Lifetimes, Rotation, and Quasi-Homogeneity in massive Stars**, Anais Pauchet et.al., [2511.03540v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03540v1)

 Population III stars supplied the first light and metals in the Universe, setting the pace of re-ionisation and early chemical enrichment. In dense haloes their evolution can be strongly influenced by the energy released when WIMPs annihilate inside the stellar core. We follow the evolution of a \(20\,M\_\odot\) Population III model with the \textsc{genec} code, adding a full treatment of spin dependent WIMP capture and annihilation. Tracks are calculated for six halo densities from \(10^{8}\) to \(3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}\) and three initial rotation rates between zero and \(0.4\,v/v\_{\mathrm{crit}}\). As soon as the capture product reaches \(\rho\_\chi\sigma\_{\mathrm{SD}}\simeq2\times10^{-28}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-1}}\), the dark-matter luminosity rivals hydrogen fusion, stretching the main-sequence lifetime from about ten million years to more than a gigayear. The extra time allows meridional circulation to smooth out differential rotation; a star that begins at \(0.4\,v/v\_{\mathrm{crit}}\) finishes core hydrogen burning with near solid-body rotation and a helium core almost twice as massive as in the dark-matter-free case. Because the nuclear timescale is longer, chemically homogeneous evolution now sets in at only \(0.2\,v/v\_{\mathrm{crit}}\), rather than the \(\gtrsim0.5\,v/v\_{\mathrm{crit}}\) required without WIMPs. For a star with \(0.4\,v/v\_{\mathrm{crit}}\), the surface hydrogen fraction drops to \(X\!\sim\!0.27\), helium rises to \(Y\!\sim\!0.73\), and primary \(^{14}\mathrm N\) increases by four orders of magnitude at He exhaustion. Moderate rotation combined with plausible dark-matter densities can therefore drive primordial massive stars towards long-lived, quasi-homogeneous evolution with distinctive chemical and spectral signatures.

2025-11-05, **Stellar-like Galactic center excess challenges particle dark matter**, Silvia Manconi et.al., [2511.03350v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03350v1)

 The Galactic Center (GC) is potentially hosting the largest indirect signal from particle dark matter (DM), which in many well-motivated models would produce gamma rays as their final states. However, this region has often been dismissed for DM studies because of the evidence for an unexpected gamma-ray component over astrophysical backgrounds at GeV energies, firstly discovered in the data of the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT), the so-called Galactic Center Excess (GCE). While this was initially considered to hint at GeV thermal relics, recent work supports a GCE interpretation in terms of a stellar population of millisecond pulsar-like sources in the Galactic bulge. Building on this preference, we re-evaluate the GC as a powerful target for indirect DM searches via gamma rays. This is achieved by combining adaptive template fitting and pixel-count statistical methods to assess the role of sub-threshold point sources in the observed \textit{Fermi}-LAT gamma-ray counts, while minimizing the mismodeling of Galactic diffuse emission backgrounds. In a fully self-consistent way, the gamma-ray data are fitted with a mixed model comprising a DM signal and a stellar bulge, both potentially contributing to the GCE. The space left for signals from weak-scale DM particle annihilations is quantified by extracting 95\% C.L. upper limits on the annihilation cross section, which, depending on the DM density profile, result in stringent limits for masses $\lesssim 300$ GeV. The robustness of our results is supported by tests on simulated data.

2025-11-05, **Wormhole spacetimes in an expanding universe: energy conditions and future singularities**, Taishi Katsuragawa et.al., [2511.03275v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03275v1)

 We study wormhole geometries embedded in an expanding universe within a four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model, where the target-space metric is identified with the spacetime Ricci tensor. In this framework, wormholes can remain stable even when conventional energy conditions are violated. However, once cosmological expansion is included, the effective energy density and pressure are modified by the cosmological fluid, enabling the energy conditions to be satisfied. We further present intriguing geometries in which a finite future singularity appears in our universe but not in another universe connected by the wormhole. Near the throat, the hypersurface becomes timelike, allowing trajectories to traverse to the other universe before the singularity and return afterwards. We also construct wormhole solutions motivated by galactic dark-matter halo profiles, where the required non-vanishing pressure arises naturally from the four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model.

2025-11-05, **Quantum Error Correction-like Noise Mitigation for Wave-like Dark Matter Searches with Quantum Sensors**, Hajime Fukuda et.al., [2511.03253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03253v1)

 We propose a quantum error correction-like noise mitigation protocol for enhancing the sensitivity of wave-like dark matter searches with quantum sensors. Our protocol uses multiple sensors to mitigate the noise affecting each sensor individually, allowing for the suppression of excitation noise that is parallel to the dark matter signal. We demonstrate that our protocol can improve the sensitivity to dark matter signals by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of sensors used. Furthermore, we find that our protocol achieves the same performance as the standard quantum limit by the ideal measurement, which is impossible to achieve due to the unknown phase of the dark matter field. Our work can be widely applied to various types of signals with unknown phases, and has the potential to enhance the sensitivity of quantum sensors such as arrays of resonant cavities.

2025-11-05, **Joule-Thomson expansion for quantum corrected AdS-Reissner-Nördstrom black holes in Kiselev spacetime with Barrow fractal entropy**, Everton M. C. Abreu et.al., [2511.03160v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03160v1)

 How can we detect the difference in the effects of the quantum corrections included in the metric of a spacetime and the quantum corrections included in the entropy of such a system? Recently, J. Barrow designed an expression based directly on black hole (BH) entropy of Bekenstein-Hawking where the geometry of the event horizon can also have an intricate, non smooth, structure, a fractal geometry. These fractal features are represented by a numerical constant parameter, the fractal parameter (FP). Since then, several interesting issues have been explored in the literature. In this work, we investigate the inversion temperature connected to the Joule-Thomson expansion from the thermodynamics of AdS-Reissner-N\"ordstrom BH by using the Barrow entropy equation where the FP has several values within a certain validity interval. We include quantum corrections in a cosmological fluid that can describe phantom dark matter or quintessence, both in a Kiselev scenario. The description of such physical systems also involves numerical solutions concerning the FP. The results are shown by temperature-pressure curves for multiple values of the parameters of the system used here. In conclusion of our analysis, we also show isenthalpic curves corresponding to fixed-mass BH processes, and we respond numerically to the question made in the first line of this abstract.

2025-11-05, **Life in the dark: Potential urability of moons of rogue planets**, Viktória Fröhlich et.al., [2511.03392v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03392v1)

 Free-floating planets are thought to be numerous in the Galaxy and may retain their moons after ejection from their natal systems. If those satellites acquire or preserve orbital eccentricity, tidal dissipation could provide a long-lasting internal heat source, potentially creating urable environments (capable of enabling abiogenesis) in the absence of stellar radiation. We explore (i) whether moons remain bound to planets expelled by a core-collapse supernova, (ii) how the explosion reshapes their orbits, and (iii) under which circumstances tidal heating can sustain urable subsurface oceans. We carried out three-dimensional N-body simulations with an 8th-order Runge-Kutta scheme, modelling homologous stellar mass loss for progenitors of 10 M$\_{\odot}$. Post-explosion orbital elements of single moons and resonant moon systems were analysed, and tidal heating power was estimated with a constant phase-lag model for several tidal dissipation functions and moon densities. All simulated moons survive the supernova and remain bound to their planets. The explosion excites moon eccentricities up to $\sim7\times10^{-4}$ and $\sim3\times10^{-3}$ for single moons of planets with circular and eccentric orbits, respectively. For resonant pairs, an eccentricity of $\leq2\times10^{-2}$ is preserved. The semi-major axis of the moons changes by $\leq0.2\%$. For 12-15\% of cases -- preferentially moons at $a\leq15\,R\_{\mathrm{planet}}$ and with $e\geq10^{-3}$ -- the specific tidal heating power lies between 0.1 and 10 times what is estimated on Europa or Enceladus, sufficient to maintain liquid oceans beneath an ice crust. Eccentricity damping timescales exceed the age of the Solar System for $a\geq10\,R\_{\mathrm{planet}}$, implying billions of years of continuous heating on the moons. Such worlds represent promising targets for future searches for extraterrestrial life.
