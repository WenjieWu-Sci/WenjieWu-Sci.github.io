2023-03-20, **An importance sampling method for Feldman-Cousins confidence intervals**, Lukas Berns et.al., [2303.11290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11290v1)

 In various high-energy physics contexts, such as neutrino-oscillation experiments, several assumptions underlying the typical asymptotic confidence interval construction are violated, such that one has to resort to computationally expensive methods like the Feldman-Cousins method for obtaining confidence intervals with proper statistical coverage. By construction, the computation of intervals at high confidence levels requires fitting millions or billions of pseudo-experiments, while wasting most of the computational cost on overly precise intervals at low confidence levels. In this work, a simple importance sampling method is introduced which reuses pseudo-experiments produced for all tested parameter values in a single mixture distribution. This results in a significant error reduction on the estimated critical values, especially at high confidence levels, and simultaneously yields a correct interpolation of these critical values between the parameter values at which the pseudo-experiments were produced. The theoretically calculated performance is demonstrated numerically using a simple example from the analysis of neutrino oscillations. The relationship to similar techniques applied in statistical mechanics and $p$-value computations is discussed.

2023-03-20, **Leptogenesis and Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in the Scotogenic Hybrid Textures of Neutrino Mass Matrix**, Ankush et.al., [2303.11149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11149v1)

 In our recent work we identify the hybrid textures of neutrino mass matrix which simultaneously account for dark matter (DM) and neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$). We also obtained the bounds on dark matter mass and effective Majorana mass $\|M\_{ee}\|$. In this work we look for those hybrid textures which altogether accounts for DM, $0\nu\beta\beta$ and leptogenesis. We have found correlation of baryon asymmetry of universe $Y$ with dark matter mass $M\_1$ and effective Majorana mass $\|M\_{ee}\|$. We use experimental bounds on relic density of dark matter ($\Omega h^2$) and baryon asymmetry of universe to identify the hybrid textures. We found that out of five hybrid textures which simultaneously satisfies the physics observations of the DM and $0\nu\beta\beta$ only three hybrid textures altogether satisfy the DM, $0\nu\beta\beta$ and leptogenesis. It is interesting to note that these three hybrid textures gives lower bound to the effective Majorana mass $\|M\_{ee}\|$ which can be probed in current and future experiments like SuperNEMO, KamLAND-Zen, NEXT, and nEXO (5 year) have sensitivity reaches of 0.05 eV, 0.045 eV, 0.03 eV, and 0.015 eV, respectively.

2023-03-20, **On massive neutral lepton scattering on nucleus**, V. A. Bednyakov et.al., [2303.10943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10943v1)

 The paper presents a theoretical approach to the description of the relativistic scattering of a massive (neutral) lepton on a nucleus, in which the latter retains its integrity. The measurable cross section of this process includes the elastic (or coherent) contribution, when the nucleus remains in its original quantum state and the inelastic (incoherent) contribution, when the nucleus goes into another (excited) quantum state. Transition from the elastic scattering regime to the inelastic scattering regime is regulated automatically by the dependence of the form factors on the momentum transferred to the nucleus. At small momentum transfers elastic scattering dominates. AS the transferred momentum increases, the contribution of the inelastic scattering increases, and the latter becomes dominant at sufficiently large transferred momenta. The scattering of massive (anti)neutrinos interacting with nucleons through the $V\mp A$ currents of the Standard Model is considered in detail. Because of the nonzero masses, an additional channel arises for elastic and inelastic scattering of these (anti)neutrinos on nuclei due to the possibility of changing the helicity of these (anti)neutrinos. The expressions obtained for the cross sections are applicable to any precision data analysis involving neutrinos and antineutrinos, especially when non-zero neutrino masses can be taken into account. These expressions can also be used in the analysis of experiments on direct detection of (neutral) massive weakly interacting relativistic dark matter particles since, unlike the generally accepted case, they simultaneously take into account both elastic and inelastic interactions of the particles. The presence of an "inelastic signal" with its characteristic signature may be the only registrable evidence of interaction of the dark matter particle with the nucleus.

2023-03-20, **Modular $A_4$ symmetry in 3+1 active-sterile neutrino masses and mixings**, Mayengbam Kishan Singh et.al., [2303.10922v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10922v1)

 Motivated by the significance of modular symmetry in describing neutrino masses and flavor structure, we apply the $A\_4$ modular symmetry in 3+1 scheme of active-sterile neutrino mixings. Neutrino oscillation observables in 3$\sigma$ range are successfully reproduced through the vev of the modulus $\tau$ in normal hierarchy(NH) as well as inverted hierarchy(IH). We have also studied other phenomenologies regarding effective masses $m\_{\beta}$ and $m\_{\beta\beta}$ in neutrinoless double beta decay. Mixings between active and sterile neutrinos are analysed in detail and the mixing elements $\vert V\_{i4}\vert $ are found to satisfy the experimental bounds. The best-fit values of the neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences ratio are determined using minimum $\chi^2$ analysis. This model predicts best-fit values of the neutrino oscillation observables as $\sin^2\theta\_{23}=0.572$, $ \sin^2\theta\_{12}=0.313$, $\sin^2\theta\_{13}=0.022$ and $r = 0.172$ for NH whereas $\sin^2\theta\_{23}=0.602,$ $\sin^2\theta\_{12}=0.288,$ $ \sin^2\theta\_{13}=0.022$ and $r = 0.172$ for IH. Our analysis is also consistent with the latest Planck cosmological upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m\_i <0.12$ eV.

2023-03-20, **Comprehensive study of LIV in atmospheric and long-baseline experiments**, Deepak Raikwal et.al., [2303.10892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10892v1)

 In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive study of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) in the context of atmospheric neutrino experiment ICAL and long-baseline experiments T2HK and DUNE. Our study consists of the full parameter space of the LIV parameters (isotropic), i.e., six CPT violating LIV parameters ($a\_{\alpha \beta}$) and six CPT conserving LIV parameters ($c\_{\alpha \beta}$). In this study, our objective is to calculate the upper bound on all the LIV parameters with respect to the individual experiments and their combination. Our results show that DUNE gives the best sensitivity for the parameters $a\_{ee}$, $a\_{e\mu}$, $a\_{e\tau}$ and $a\_{\mu\tau}$ in its 7 years of running whereas ICAL gives the best sensitivity on $a\_{\mu\mu}$, $a\_{\mu\tau}$, $c\_{ee}$, $c\_{\mu \mu}$, $c\_{\tau\tau}$ and $c\_{\mu\tau}$ in its 10 years of running. For $a\_{\tau\tau}$, the sensitivity of DUNE and ICAL is similar. The combination of T2HK, DUNE and ICAL, gives the best sensitivity for $a\_{e\mu}$ and $a\_{ee}$ with respect to all the existing bounds in the literature. For the CPT even diagonal parameters (isotropic) $c\_{ee}$ and $c\_{\mu\mu}$, our work provides the first ever bounds.

2023-03-19, **Astrophysical and Cosmological Searches for Lorentz Invariance Violation**, Shantanu Desai et.al., [2303.10643v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10643v1)

 Lorentz invariance is one of the fundamental tenets of Special Relativity, and has been extensively tested with laboratory and astrophysical observations. However, many quantum gravity models and theories beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics predict a violation of Lorentz invariance at energies close to Planck scale. This article reviews observational and experimental tests of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) with photons, neutrinos and gravitational waves. Most astrophysical tests of LIV using photons are based on searching for a correlation of the spectral lag data with redshift and energy. These have been primarily carried out using compact objects such as pulsars, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and Gamma-ray bursts (GRB). There have also been some claims for LIV from some of these spectral lag observations with GRBs, which however are in conflict with the most stringent limits obtained from other LIV searches. Searches have also been carried out using polarization measurements from GRBs and AGNs. For neutrinos, tests have been made using both astrophysical observations at MeV energies (from SN 1987A) as well as in the TeV-PeV energy range based on IceCube observations, atmospheric neutrinos, and long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. Cosmological tests of LIV entail looking for a constancy of the speed of light as a function of redshift using multiple observational probes, as well as looking for birefringence in Cosmic Microwave background observations. This article will review all of these aforementioned observational tests of LIV, including results which are in conflict with each other.

2023-03-19, **Impact of nuclear matrix element calculations for current and future neutrinoless double beta decay searches**, Federica Pompa et.al., [2303.10562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10562v1)

 Nuclear matrix elements (NME) are a crucial input for the interpretation of neutrinoless double beta decay data. We consider a representative set of recent NME calculations from different methods and investigate the impact on the present bound on the effective Majorana mass $m\_{\beta\beta}$ by performing a combined analysis of the available data as well as on the sensitivity reach of future projects. A crucial role is played by the recently discovered short-range contribution to the NME, induced by light Majorana neutrino masses. Depending on the NME model and the relative sign of the long- and short-range contributions, the current $3\sigma$ bound can change between $m\_{\beta\beta} < 40$ meV and 600 meV. The sign-uncertainty may either boost the sensitivity of next-generation experiments beyond the region for $m\_{\beta\beta}$ predicted for inverted mass ordering or prevent even advanced setups to reach this region. Furthermore, we study the possibility to distinguish between different NME calculations by assuming a positive signal and by combining measurements from different isotopes. Such a discrimination will be impossible if the relative sign of the long- and short-range contribution remains unknown, but can become feasible if $m\_{\beta\beta} \gtrsim 40$ meV and if the relative sign is known to be positive. Sensitivities will be dominated by the advanced $^{76}$Ge and $^{136}$Xe setups assumed here, but NME model-discrimination improves if data from a third isotope is added, e.g., from $^{130}$Te or $^{100}$Mo.

2023-03-20, **Does gravitational confinement sustain flat galactic rotation curves without dark matter?**, W. E. V. Barker et.al., [2303.11094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11094v1)

 The short answer is $\textit{probably no}$. Specifically, this paper considers a recent body of work which suggests that general relativity requires neither the support of dark matter halos, nor unconventional baryonic profiles, nor any infrared modification, to be consistent after all with the anomalously rapid orbits observed in many galactic discs. In particular, the gravitoelectric flux is alleged to collapse nonlinearly into regions of enhanced force, in an analogue of the colour-confining chromoelectric flux tube model which has yet to be captured by conventional post-Newtonian methods. However, we show that the scalar gravity model underpinning this proposal is wholly inconsistent with the nonlinear Einstein equations, which themselves appear to prohibit the linear confinement-type potentials which could indicate a disordered gravitational phase. Our findings challenge the fidelity of the previous Euclidean lattice analyses. We confirm by direct calculation using a number of perturbation schemes and gauges that the next-to-leading order gravitoelectric correction to the rotation curve of a reasonable baryonic profile would be imperceptible. The `gravitoelectric flux collapse' programme was also supported by using intragalactic lensing near a specific galactic baryon profile as a field strength heuristic. We recalculate this lensing effect, and conclude that it has been overstated by three orders of magnitude. As a by-product, our analysis suggests fresh approaches to (i) the fluid ball conjecture and (ii) gravitational energy localisation, both to be pursued in future work. In summary, whilst it may be interesting to consider the possibility of confinement-type effects in gravity, we may at least conclude here that confinement-type effects $\textit{cannot play any significant part}$ in explaining flat or rising galactic rotation curves without dark matter halos.

2023-03-20, **Revisiting Puffy Dark Matter with Novel Insights: Partial Wave Analysis**, Wenyu Wang et.al., [2303.11058v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11058v1)

 We present a comprehensive study on the self-interaction cross-section of puffy dark matter (DM) particles, which have a significant intrinsic size compared to their Compton wavelength. For such puffy DM self-interaction cross-section in the resonant and classical regimes, our study demonstrates the significance of the Yukawa potential and the necessity of partial wave analysis: (i) Due to the finite-size effect of puffy DM particles, the new Yukawa potential of puffy DM is found to enlarge the Born-effective regime for the self-interaction cross-section, compared with the point-like DM; (ii) Our partial wave analysis shows that depending on the value of the ratio between $R\_{\chi}$ (radius of a puffy DM particle) and $1/m\_{\phi}$ (force range), the three regimes (Born-effective, resonant and classical) for puffy DM self-interaction cross-section can be very different from the point-like DM; (iii) We find that to solve the small-scale anomalies via self-interacting puffy DM, the Born-effective and the resonant regimes exist for dwarf galaxies, while for the cluster and Milky Way galaxy the non-Born regime is necessary.

2023-03-20, **Physical evolution of dark matter halo around the depletion boundary**, Hongyu Gao et.al., [2303.10887v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10887v1)

 We investigate the build-up of the halo profile out to large scale in a cosmological simulation, focusing on the roles played by the recently proposed depletion radii. We explicitly show that halo growth is accompanied by the depletion of the environment, with the inner depletion radius demarcating the two. This evolution process is also observed via the formation of a trough in the bias profile, with the two depletion radii identifying key scales in the evolution. The ratio between the inner depletion radius and the virial radius is approximately a constant factor of 2 across redshifts and halo masses. The ratio between their enclosed densities is also close to a constant of 0.18. These simple scaling relations reflect the largely universal scaled mass profile on these scales, which only evolves weakly with redshift. The overall picture of the boundary evolution can be broadly divided into three stages according to the maturity of the depletion process, with cluster halos lagging behind low mass ones in the evolution. We also show that the traditional slow and fast accretion dichotomy of halo growth can be identified as accelerated and decelerated depletion phases respectively.

2023-03-19, **Large active-area superconducting microwire detector array with single-photon sensitivity in the near-infrared**, Jamie S. Luskin et.al., [2303.10739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10739v1)

 Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) are the highest-performing technology for time-resolved single-photon counting from the UV to the near-infrared. The recent discovery of single-photon sensitivity in micrometer-scale superconducting wires is a promising pathway to explore for large active area devices with application to dark matter searches and fundamental physics experiments. We present 8-pixel $1 mm^2$ superconducting microwire single photon detectors (SMSPDs) with $1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$-wide wires fabricated from WSi and MoSi films of various stoichiometries using electron-beam and optical lithography. Devices made from all materials and fabrication techniques show saturated internal detection efficiency at 1064 nm in at least one pixel, and the best performing device made from silicon-rich WSi shows single-photon sensitivity in all 8 pixels and saturated internal detection efficiency in 6/8 pixels. This detector is the largest reported active-area SMSPD or SNSPD with near-IR sensitivity published to date, and the first report of an SMSPD array. By further optimizing the photolithography techniques presented in this work, a viable pathway exists to realize larger devices with $cm^2$-scale active area and beyond.

# supernova (2)

2023-03-20, **Radio and infrared study of the supernova remnant candidate HESS J1912+101**, Laura Duvidovich et.al., [2303.11115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11115v1)

 Aims: We provide new insights into the gamma-ray emission from HESS J1912+101, a TeV supernova remnant candidate probably associated with the radio pulsar PSR J1913+1011. Methods: We obtained new observations at 1.5 GHz using the VLA in the D configuration, with the purpose of detecting the radio shell of the putative remnant. In addition, we observed a single pointing at 6.0 GHz toward PSR J1913+1011 to look for a radio pulsar wind nebula. We also studied the properties of the surrounding interstellar medium using data of the 13CO, HI, and infrared emissions, obtained from public surveys. Results: We did not find evidence of a radio shell down to the sensitivity of the new image at 1.5 GHz. We detect faint diffuse emission around PSR J1913+1011 at 6.0 GHz, which could represent a radio pulsar wind nebula powered by the pulsar. We find dense ambient gas at 60 km/s, which shows a good spatial correspondence with the TeV emission only in the western and eastern directions. There is also dense gas near the center of HESS J1912+101, where the TeV emission is weak. Using infrared data, we identify an active star-forming region in the western part of the shell. Conclusions: Based on the poor spatial match between the ambient gas and the TeV emission (which shows a good correlation in the western and eastern directions and an anticorrelation in the other directions), we conclude that the hadronic mechanism alone does not give a satisfactory explanation of the gamma rays from HESS J1912+101. Additional contributions may come from leptonic processes in the shell of the supernova remnant, together with contributions from PSR J1913$+$1011 and its pulsar wind nebula and/or from the star-forming region. A confident determination of the distance to the putative remnant is necessary to determine whether these sources are associated or just appear superimposed in the line of sight.

2023-03-20, **Anisotropic Universe in $f(Q,T)$ gravity, a novel study**, Tee-How Loo et.al., [2303.10884v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10884v1)

 $f(Q,T)$ theory of gravity is very recently proposed to incorporate within the action Lagrangian, the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor along with the non-metricity scalar $Q$. The cosmological application of this theory in a spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous Universe is well-studied. However, our Universe is not isotropic since the Planck era and therefore to study a complete evolution of the Universe we must investigate the $f(Q,T)$ theory in a model with a small anisotropy. This motivated us to presume a locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi-I spacetime and derive the motion equations. We analyse the model candidate $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q^{n+1}+\beta T$, and to constrain the parameter $n$, we employ the statistical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with the Bayesian approach using two independent observational datasets, namely, the Hubble datasets, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) datasets.
