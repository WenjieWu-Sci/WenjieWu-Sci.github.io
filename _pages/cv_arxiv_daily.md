2023-05-11, **Searching for temporary gamma-ray dark blazars associated with IceCube neutrinos**, Emma Kun et.al., [2305.06729v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06729v1)

 Tensions between the diffuse gamma-ray sky observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the diffuse high-energy neutrino sky detected by the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory question our knowledge about high-energy neutrino sources in the gamma-ray regime. While blazars are among the most energetic persistent particle accelerators in the Universe, studies suggest that they could account for up to for 10-30% of the neutrino flux measured by IceCube. Our recent results highlighted that the associated IceCube neutrinos arrived in a local gamma-ray minimum (dip) of three strong neutrino point-source candidates. We increase the sample of neutrino-source candidates to study their gamma-ray light curves. We generate the one-year Fermi-LAT light curve for 8 neutrino source candidate blazars (RBS 0958, GB6 J1040+0617, PKS 1313-333, TXS 0506+056, PKS 1454-354, NVSS J042025-374443, PKS 0426-380 and PKS 1502+106), centered on the detection time of the associated IceCube neutrinos. We apply the Bayesian block algorithm on the light curves to characterize their variability. Our results indicate that GB6 J1040+0617 was in the phase of high gamma-ray activity, while none of the other 7 neutrino source candidates were statistically bright during the detection of the corresponding neutrinos and that indeed even most of the times neutrinos arrived in a faint gamma-ray phase of the light curves. This suggests that the 8 source-candidate blazars (associated with 7 neutrino events) in our reduced sample are either not the sources of the corresponding IceCube neutrinos, or that an in-source effect (e.g. suppression of gamma rays due to high gamma-gamma opacity) complicates the multimessenger scenario of neutrino emission for these blazars.

2023-05-11, **Interpreting the GeV-TeV Gamma-Ray Spectra of Local Giant Molecular Clouds using GEANT4 Simulation**, Abhijit Roy et.al., [2305.06693v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06693v1)

 Recently, the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray satellite has detected six Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) located in the Gould Belt and the Aquila Rift regions. In half of these objects (Taurus, Orion A, Orion B), the observed gamma-ray spectrum can be explained using the Galactic diffused Cosmic Ray (CR) interactions with the gas environments. In the remaining three GMCs (Rho Oph, Aquila Rift, Cepheus), the origin of the gamma-ray spectrum is still not well established. We use the GEometry ANd Tracking (GEANT4) simulation framework in order to simulate gamma-ray emission due to CR/GMC interaction in these three objects, taking into account the gas density distribution inside the GMCs. We find that propagation of diffused Galactic CRs inside these GMCs can explain the Fermi-LAT detected gamma-ray spectra. Further, our estimated TeV-PeV fluxes are consistent with the HAWC upper limits, available for the Aquila Rift GMC. As last step, we compute the total neutrino flux estimated for these GMCs and compare it with the IceCube detection sensitivity.

2023-05-11, **Parameter space for testable leptogenesis**, Yannis Georis et.al., [2305.06663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06663v1)

 Extending the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos provides a minimal explanation for both light neutrino masses (through the type-I seesaw mechanism) and the baryon asymmetry of our universe (through leptogenesis). We map here for the first time the range of heavy neutrino mixing angle consistent with both neutrino masses and leptogenesis in a scenario with 3 generations of right-handed neutrinos with Majorana masses between 50 MeV and 70 TeV. Due to the presence of a third degree of freedom that remains much more feebly coupled to the Standard Model thermal bath, we observe that the parameter space is much larger compared to the minimal scenario with 2 generations. This greatly enhances the testability prospects for low-scale leptogenesis and, in the most optimistic scenario, would allow experimentalists not only to discover right-handed neutrinos but also to perform consistency checks of the model.

2023-05-11, **Vacuum stability and Q-ball formation in the Type II Seesaw model**, Naoyuki Haba et.al., [2305.06592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06592v1)

 We investigate vacuum stability and Q-ball formation in the Type II seesaw model by considering the effective potential for scalar fields, taking into account renormalization effects. We find that the quartic coupling for the triplet Higgs can vanish at a high energy scale, creating a flat direction where Q-ball formation can occur. If Q-balls are produced, they eventually decay into leptons via neutrino Yukawa couplings with the triplet Higgs. If this decay occurs above the electroweak scale, the leptogenesis scenario can work, and the baryon number is produced via the sphaleron effect. We show that there are parameter regions where the above scenario occurs, taking into account phenomenological constraints.

2023-05-11, **Improving constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity using neural network based reconstruction**, Thomas Fl√∂ss et.al., [2305.07018v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07018v1)

 We study the use of U-Nets in reconstructing the linear dark matter density field and its consequences for constraining cosmological parameters, in particular primordial non-Gaussianity. Our network is able to reconstruct the initial conditions of redshift $z=0$ density fields from N-body simulations with $90\%$ accuracy out to $k \leq 0.4$ h/Mpc, competitive with state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms at a fraction of the computational cost. We study the information content of the reconstructed $z=0$ density field with a Fisher analysis using the QUIJOTE simulation suite, including non-Gaussian initial conditions. Combining the pre- and post-reconstructed power spectrum and bispectrum data up to $k\_{\rm max} = 0.52$ h/Mpc, we find significant improvements on all parameters. Most notably, we find a factor $3.65$ (local), $3.54$ (equilateral) and $2.90$ (orthogonal) improvement on the marginalized errors of $f\_{\rm NL}$ as compared to only using the pre-reconstructed data. We show that these improvements can be attributed to a combination of reduced data covariance and parameter degeneracy. The results constitute an important step towards more optimal inference of primordial non-Gaussianity from non-linear scales.

2023-05-11, **Testing the Cosmological Principle: On the Time Dilation of Distant Sources**, Oliver T. Oayda et.al., [2305.06771v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06771v1)

 We present a novel test of the cosmological principle: the idea that, on sufficiently large scales, the universe should appear homogeneous and isotropic to observers comoving with the Hubble flow. This is a fundamental assumption in modern cosmology, underpinning the use of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric as part of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. However, the observed dipole imprinted on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is interpreted as our departure from the Hubble flow, and such a proper motion will induce a directionally-dependent time dilation over the sky. We illustrate the feasibility of detection of this 'time dilation dipole' and sketch the practical steps involved in its extraction from a catalogue of sources with intrinsic time-scales. In essence, whilst the scale of this dilation is small, being of order of 0.1%, it will in principle be detectable in large scale surveys of variable cosmological sources, such as quasars and supernovae. The degree of alignment of the time dilation dipole with the kinematic dipole derived from the CMB will provide a new assessment of the cosmological principle, and address the tension in dipole measures from other observations.

2023-05-11, **Effect of the cosmological model on LIV constraints from GRB Time-Delays datasets**, Denitsa Staicova et.al., [2305.06504v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06504v1)

 Putting constraints on a possible Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) from astrophysical sources such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an essential tool for finding evidences of new theories of quantum gravity (QG) that predict energy-dependent speed of light. Such a search has its own difficulties, so usually, the effect of the cosmological model is understudied and the default model is a fixed-parameters $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we use different astrophysical datasets to study the effect of a number of dark energy models on the LIV constrains. To this end, we combine two public time-delay GRB datasets with the supernovae Pantheon dataset, a number of angular baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), the cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance prior and a GRB or quasars dataset. We find for $\alpha$ the expected average value of $\sim 4 \times 10^{-4}$, corresponding to $E\_{QG}\ge 10^{17}$ GeV for both time-delay (TD) datasets, with the second one being more sensitive to the cosmological model. We find that the cosmology amounts to at least 20\% deviation in our constraints on the energy. Also interestingly, adding the TD points makes the DE models less-preferable statistically and shifts the value of the parameter $c/(H\_0 r\_d)$ down, making it smaller than the expected value. We see that possible LIV measurements depend critically on the transparency of the assumptions behind the published data with respect to cosmology and that taking it into account may be important contribution in the case of possible detection.
