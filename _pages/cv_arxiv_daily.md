2026-01-15, **Multimessenger Prospects for Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts: Joint Neutrino and X-Ray Observations**, Wenkang Lian et.al., [2601.10317v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10317v1)

 Low--luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LLGRBs) are promising candidates for high-energy neutrinos, yet no coincident neutrino events have been detected so far. Recent advances in X-ray time-domain astronomy, together with the development of next-generation neutrino telescopes, open new opportunities for joint X-ray and neutrino observations of these transients. We calculate the jet dynamical evolution and the associated neutrino production for both non-magnetized and magnetized outflows. For individual events, joint X-ray and neutrino detection is generally limited to nearby LLGRBs or sources with high luminosities. Thus, we consider a next-generation neutrino telescope with an effective area enhanced by a factor of $\sim30$ relative to IceCube. In the non-magnetized scenario, joint detection of individual events is enabled for sources with typical isotropic luminosities of $L\_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to luminosity distances of $D\_L\sim1.6\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $1$ per year. In contrast, for the magnetized scenario at the same luminosity, the accessible distance is significantly reduced, with joint observations confined to sources within $D\_L\sim6.5\times10^{1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and an expected detection rate of order $0.5$ per year. For stacked samples of $\sim100$ magnetized LLGRBs, stacking substantially enlarges the accessible distance range, enabling joint observations for sources with representative luminosities of $L\_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim1\times10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to $D\_L\lesssim7.0\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $2$ per year. These results demonstrate that joint X-ray and next-generation neutrino observations enable a practical multimessenger probe of LLGRBs.

2026-01-15, **Revealing Neutrino Mass Ordering at CEPC and FCC-ee**, Wei Liu et.al., [2601.10311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10311v1)

 The neutrino masses ordering remains one of the most important open questions in neutrino physics. While upcoming oscillation experiments aim to resolve this problem at low energies, complementary approaches are highly desirable. In this Letter, we show that the neutrino mass ordering can be probed at high-energy colliders through the lepton-flavor structure of heavy neutral lepton (HNL) interactions. In the minimal Type-I seesaw scenario with two nearly degenerate HNLs, the heavy--light neutrino mixings are strongly correlated with the light-neutrino mass spectrum, leading to distinct flavor patterns for the normal and inverted hierarchies. We demonstrate that future $Z$ factories, such as CEPC and FCC-ee, can probe the neutrino mass ordering for total HNL mixings as small as $U\_{\rm tot}^2 \gtrsim 4 \times 10^{-9}$, and discriminate between the two hierarchies for $U\_{\rm tot}^2 \gtrsim 10^{-6}$. Our results establish collider searches for HNLs as a powerful and complementary probe of the neutrino mass ordering.

2026-01-15, **Physics with next generation neutrino experiments: ESSnuSB**, ESSnuSB et.al., [2601.10271v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10271v1)

 In this proceedings we explore the physics potential of the ESSnuSBplus setup to study beam and non-beam based physics scenarios in both standard and new physics cases. The ESSnuSBplus setup consists of three neutrino sources: the main ESS linac, a low energy monitored neutrino beam and a low energy nuSTORM facility and three detectors: the main far detector and two near detectors. The goal of this facility is to measure the leptonic CP phase with extremely high precision and the neutrino nucleus cross-section in the few hundred MeV region.

2026-01-15, **Updated Results for Kinematic Factors in Double Beta Decays**, S. Ghinescu et.al., [2601.10247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10247v1)

 Accurate calculations of phase space factors (PSFs), electron energy spectra and angular correlations are essential for designing and interpreting double-beta decay (DBD) experiments. These quantities help maximize sensitivity to potential signals, distinguish between different decay modes and interpret the data. In this work we provide updated results for these kinematic factors for two-neutrino ($2νββ$) and neutrinoless ($0νββ$) decay modes, including electron-emission, positron-emission and electron capture transitions. The calculations are performed with an adapted Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater method which allows for orthogonality of the wave functions of electrons and positrons in bound and continuum states and incorporates relevant atomic features such us screening, finite nuclear size, exchange corrections and phase shift effects. We provide tables with updated PSFs calculated both in the closure approximation and using the Taylor expansion method, for a large number of DBD isotopes. We discuss the impact of individual atomic corrections and find that our results are in line with predictions reported in recent literature. In some specific cases we find differences between our PSF values and those previously reported which are worth considering for better prediction and interpretation of DBD data. Then, we provide numerical values for $^{76}\text{Ge}$, $^{100}\text{Mo}$, $^{130}\text{Te}$ and $^{136}\text{Xe}$, which are most investigated in current DBD experiments. Similar data for other isotopes are available upon request.

2026-01-15, **Dirac mass matrix textures and the lightest right-handed neutrino mass scale in Type I seesaw leptogenesis**, Shuta Kosuge et.al., [2601.10063v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10063v1)

 The type I seesaw mechanism is one of the leading proposed explanations for how neutrinos acquire their tiny masses. However, the mass scale of the undiscovered right-handed neutrinos required by this mechanism remains undetermined. Assuming vanilla leptogenesis in the two-flavor regime, we work backwards to find the required general textures of the Dirac mass matrix from which we determine the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino to be around $10^9 {\rm GeV}$ to $10^{12} {\rm GeV}$.

2026-01-15, **Search for sub-GeV dark particles in $η\toπ^0+\rm{invisible}$ decay**, BESIII Collaboration et.al., [2601.10597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10597v1)

 Using (10087$\pm$44)$\times$10$^{6}$ $J/ψ$ events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider at the center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=3.097~\rm{GeV}$, we report the first search for $η\toπ^0S\toπ^0χ\barχ$ with $S$ denotes an on-shell dark scalar boson and $χ$ an invisible dark matter particle. No significant signals are observed with $S$ mass ranging from 0 to 400 $\rm{MeV}/c^2$. The upper limits on the branching fractions and the new physics coupling strengths between $S$ and quarks are set to be $(1.8\sim5.5)\times10^{-5}$ and $(1.3\sim3.2)\times10^{-5}$ at the 90% confidence level, respectively. The constraints on the dark-matter-nucleon scattering cross section is improved by approximately 5 orders of magnitude over previous dark-matter-nucleon scattering experiments, providing unique insights into sub-GeV dark matter.

2026-01-15, **Direct Detection of Type II-P Supernova Progenitors with the Euclid and CSST Surveys**, Junjie Wu et.al., [2601.10121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10121v1)

 A central goal in supernova (SN) research is to identify and characterize their progenitors. However, this is very difficult due to the limited archival images with sufficient depth and spatial resolution required for direct progenitor detection and due to the circumstellar dust which often biases the estimate of their intrinsic parameters. This field will be revolutionized by Euclid and the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), which conduct deep, wide-field, high-resolution and multi-band imaging surveys. We analyze their detection capability by comparing the model magnitudes of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors with the detection limits under different conditions, and we estimate the annual detection rates with Monte-Carlo simulations. We explore how to recover the intrinsic properties of SN progenitors with the help of radiation transfer calculations in circumstellar dust. We find the optical and near-infrared filters of the Euclid and CSST are highly effective for detecting RSG progenitors. We predict that archival images from the completed 2 surveys will enable $\lesssim13$ (or 24) progenitor detections per year within the mass range of 8--16 (or 8--25)M\_\odot, an order of magnitude higher than the current detection rate of $\sim1$ detection per year. In the presence of circumstellar dust, the emerging spectral energy distribution (SED) of the progenitor is mainly affected by the optical depth and is almost independent of dust temperature in the Euclid and CSST filters. Our mock tests demonstrate that one can derive the progenitor mass and dust optical depth simultaneously by fitting the observed SED over the 11 filters of the 2 surveys while fixing the dust temperature to a typical value. Euclid and CSST will significantly enlarge the sample of direct progenitor detections with accurate mass measurements, which is crucial to resolve the long-standing RSG problem.
