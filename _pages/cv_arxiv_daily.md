2023-03-29, **New Insight on Neutrino Dark Matter Interactions from Small-Scale CMB Observations**, Philippe Brax et.al., [2303.16895v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16895v1)

 We revisit the possibility of using cosmological observations to constrain models that involve interactions between neutrinos and dark matter. We show that small-scale measurements of the cosmic microwave background with a few per cent accuracy are critical to uncover unique signatures from models with tiny couplings that would require a much higher sensitivity at lower multipoles, such as those probed by the Planck satellite. We analyze the high-multipole data released by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, both independently and in combination with Planck and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, finding a compelling preference for a non-vanishing coupling, $\log\_{10}u\_{\nu \textrm{DM}}=-5.20^{+1.2}\_{-0.74}$ at 68% CL. This aligns with other CMB-independent probes, such as Lyman-$\alpha$. We illustrate how this coupling could be accounted for in the presence of dark matter interactions with a sterile neutrino.

2023-03-29, **General-relativistic simulations of the formation of a magnetized hybrid star**, Anson Ka Long Yip et.al., [2303.16820v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16820v1)

 Strongly magnetized neutron stars are popular candidates for producing detectable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals. A rapid density increase in a neutron star core could also trigger the phase transition from hadrons to deconfined quarks and form a hybrid star. This formation process could release a considerable amount of energy in the form of gravitational waves and neutrinos. Hence, the formation of a magnetized hybrid star is an interesting scenario for detecting all these signals. These detections may provide essential probes for the magnetic field and composition of such stars. Thus far, a dynamical study of the formation of a magnetized hybrid star has yet to be realized. Here, we investigate the formation dynamics and the properties of a magnetized hybrid star through dynamical simulations. We find that the maximum values of rest-mass density and magnetic field strength increase slightly and these two quantities are coupled in phase during the formation. We then demonstrate that all microscopic and macroscopic quantities of the resulting hybrid star vary dramatically when the maximum magnetic field strength goes beyond a threshold of $\sim 5 \times 10^{17}$ G but they are insensitive to the magnetic field below this threshold. Specifically, the magnetic deformation makes the rest-mass density drop significantly, suppressing the matter fraction in the mixed phase. Therefore, this work provides a solid support for the magnetic effects on a hybrid star, so it is possible to link observational signals from the star to its magnetic field configuration.

2023-03-29, **Yet another QFT model of neutrino oscillations**, W. Grimus et.al., [2303.16655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16655v1)

 We consider a quantum field theory (QFT) model of neutrino oscillations in vacuum that attempts to take into account that the neutrino source particle and the neutrino detection particle both interact with their respective environments by collisions. Our model is minimal in a twofold sense. Firstly we simply assume that neutrino production and detection take place in between collisions in time intervals $\Delta t$ and $\tau$, respectively. Secondly, we only introduce the two wave packets that are absolutely necessary which are those of the neutrino source and the neutrino detection particle. Within this model we find that, for all practical purposes, there are no decoherence effects in the neutrino oscillation amplitude and oscillations occur in space not in time. Moreover, our model leads to the correct time correlation between neutrino production and detection and to a factorization of the event rate of the compound neutrino production--detection process into decay rate, oscillation probability and detection cross section.

2023-03-29, **Spontaneous Scalarization in Proto-neutron Stars**, Fahimeh Rahimi et.al., [2303.16630v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16630v1)

 Proto-neutron stars are born when a highly evolved and massive star collapses under gravity. In this paper, we investigate the spontaneous scalarization in proto-neutron stars. Based on the scalar tensor theory of gravity as well as the physical conditions in proto-neutron star, we examine the structure of proto-neutron star. To describe the fluid in proto-neutron star, we utilize $SU(2)$ chiral sigma model and the finite temperature extension of the Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone quantum many-body theory in the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approximation. Here, we apply the equation of state of proto-neutron stars considering different cases i.e. hot pure neutron matter and hot $\beta$-stable neutron star matter without neutrino trapping as well as with neutrino trapping. The effects of temperature and entropy of proto-neutron stars on the star structure are also studied. Our results confirm that the spontaneous scalarization is affected by different physical conditions in proto-neutron stars.

2023-03-29, **Flavor conversions with energy-dependent neutrino emission and absorption**, Chinami Kato et.al., [2303.16453v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16453v1)

 Fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFCs) and collisional flavor instabilities (CFIs) potentially affect the dynamics of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). Under the assumption of homogeneous neutrinos, we investigate effects of neutrino emission and absorption (EA) by matters through both single and multi-energy numerical simulations with physically motivated setup. In our models, FFCs dominate over CFIs in the early phase, while EA secularly and significantly give impacts on flavor conversions. They facilitate angular swaps, or the full exchange between electron neutrinos ($\nu\_e$) and heavy-leptonic neutrinos ($\nu\_x$). As a result, the number density of $\nu\_x$ becomes more abundant than the case without EA, despite the fact that the isotropization by EA terminates the FFCs earlier. In the later phase, the system approaches new asymptotic states characterized by EA and CFIs, in which rich energy-dependent structures also emerge. Multi-energy effects sustain FFCs and the time evolution of the flavor conversion becomes energy dependent, which are essentially in line with effects of the isoenergetic scattering studied in our previous paper. We also find that $\nu\_x$ in the high-energy region convert into $\nu\_e$ via flavor conversions and then they are absorbed through charged current reactions, exhibiting the possibility of new path of heating matters.

2023-03-29, **Type-II seesaw Complex Triplet Model: Phase Transition and A Global Fit Analysis**, Yong Du et.al., [2303.16400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16400v1)

 The type-II seesaw model can explain neutrino masses and address the baryon asymmetry problem of the Universe simultaneously. In this letter, we explore its phase transition and the resulting gravitational wave signals. We find a strong first-order electroweak phase transition generically prefers a relatively light triplet in the $300\sim500$GeV range, which is ideal for collider searches and can generate gravitational waves within the sensitivity reach of BBO and Ultimate-DECIGO. While above $\sim$1TeV where a future 100TeV $pp$ collider will play a key role in model discovery, we integrate out the triplet and perform a global fit analysis of this model at various future colliders. A lower bound in the $10^{-3}\sim10^{-2}$eV range on the triplet vacuum expectation value is obtained, which is comparable to or even better than that from current $\mu\to e\gamma$ experiments depending on the lightest neutrino mass.

2023-03-28, **A Search for IceCube sub-TeV Neutrinos Correlated with Gravitational-Wave Events Detected By LIGO/Virgo**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2303.15970v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15970v1)

 The LIGO/Virgo collaboration published the catalogs GWTC-1, GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 containing candidate gravitational-wave (GW) events detected during its runs O1, O2 and O3. These GW events can be possible sites of neutrino emission. In this paper, we present a search for neutrino counterparts of 90 GW candidates using IceCube DeepCore, the low-energy infill array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The search is conducted using an unbinned maximum likelihood method, within a time window of 1000 s and uses the spatial and timing information from the GW events. The neutrinos used for the search have energies ranging from a few GeV to several tens of TeV. We do not find any significant emission of neutrinos, and place upper limits on the flux and the isotropic-equivalent energy emitted in low-energy neutrinos. We also conduct a binomial test to search for source populations potentially contributing to neutrino emission. We report a non-detection of a significant neutrino-source population with this test.

2023-03-28, **Probing Heavy Neutrinos at the LHC from Fat-jet using Machine Learning**, Wei Liu et.al., [2303.15920v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15920v1)

 We explore the potential to use machine learning methods to search for heavy neutrinos, from their hadronic final states including a fat-jet signal, via the processes $pp \rightarrow W^{\pm *}\rightarrow \mu^{\pm} N \rightarrow \mu^{\pm} \mu^{\mp} W^{\pm} \rightarrow \mu^{\pm} \mu^{\mp} J$ at hadron colliders. We use either the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree or Multi-Layer Perceptron methods to analyse the observables incorporating the jet substructure information, which is performed at hadron colliders with $\sqrt{s}=$ 13, 27, 100 TeV. It is found that, among the observables, the invariant masses of variable system and the observables from the leptons are the most powerful ones to distinguish the signal from the background. With the help of machine learning techniques, the limits on the active-sterile mixing have been improved by about one magnitude comparing to the cut-based analyses, with $V\_{\mu N}^2 \lesssim 10^{-4}$ for the heavy neutrinos with masses, 100 GeV$~<m\_N<~$1 TeV.

2023-03-28, **Testing the type II seesaw leptogenesis at the LHC**, Chengcheng Han et.al., [2303.15709v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15709v1)

 The type II seesaw leptogenesis simultaneously explains the origin of neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of our universe, and the inflation. The large hadron collider(LHC) provides an opportunity to directly test the type II seesaw leptogenesis by looking for the predicted triplet Higgs. In this paper, we perform an analysis of the detection prospect for the triplet Higgs at the LHC through the multi-lepton channels. We find that due to the contribution of $pp\to H^{\pm \pm }H^{\mp }$ process, the sensitivity of multi-lepton channels searching for the doubly-charged Higgs pair production can be improved. We also investigate the $3l+ {E}^{\rm miss}\_{\rm T}$ signals to probe the $pp\to H^{\pm \pm }H^{\mp }$ production and find that the future high luminosity LHC could probe a triplet Higgs around 1.2 TeV at $2\sigma$ level.

2023-03-29, **Development of low-threshold detectors for low-mass dark matter searches with a p-type germanium detector operated at cryogenic temperature**, Mathbar Raut et.al., [2303.16807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16807v1)

 This study investigates new technology for enhancing the sensitivity of low-mass dark matter detection by analyzing charge transport in a p-type germanium detector at 5.2 K. To achieve low-threshold detectors, precise calculations of the binding energies of dipole and cluster dipole states, as well as the cross-sections of trapping affected by the electric field, are essential. The detector was operated in two modes: depleted at 77 K before cooling to 5.2 K and cooled directly to 5.2 K with various bias voltages. Our results indicate that the second mode produces lower binding energies and suggests different charge states under varying operating modes. Notably, our measurements of the dipole and cluster dipole state binding energies at zero fields were $8.716\pm 0.435$ meV and $6.138\pm 0.308$ meV, respectively. These findings have strong implications for the development of low-threshold detectors for detecting low-mass dark matter in the future.

2023-03-29, **The equilibrium condition in gravitational collapse and its application to a cosmological scenario**, Dipanjan Dey et.al., [2303.16789v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16789v1)

 We discuss the equilibrium conditions of the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric matter cloud. We analyze the spinor structure of a general collapsing space-time and redefine the equilibrium conditions by using Cartan scalars. We qualitatively investigate the equilibrium configuration of a two-fluid system consisting of a dust-like fluid and a fluid with a negative equation of state. We use our results to investigate certain cosmological scenarios where dark energy can cluster inside the over-dense regions of dark matter and together reaches a stable configuration. We compare the outcomes of our work with existing work where the virialization technique is used to stabilize the two-fluid system.

2023-03-29, **Pitfalls in applying gravitomagnetism to galactic rotation curve modelling**, Kostas Glampedakis et.al., [2303.16679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16679v1)

 The flatness of galaxy rotation curves at large radii is generally considered to be a significant piece of evidence in support of the existence of dark matter. Several studies have claimed that post-Newtonian corrections to the Newtonian equations of galaxy dynamics remove the need for dark matter. A few recent studies have examined these claims, and identified errors in their reasoning. We add to this critique by giving what we consider to be particularly simple and transparent description of the errors made in these post-Newtonian calculations, some of which were of a rather technical nature, others more fundamental, e.g. the loss of the correct relativistic scaling, promoting small corrections to order unity changes. Our work reinforces the orthodoxy that post-Newtonian effects are indeed too small to significantly alter galactic rotation curves, and will hopefully serve as a useful guide for others, pointing out subtle errors that one might inadvertently make in such calculations.

2023-03-29, **SPARC HSBs, and LSBs, the surface density of dark matter haloes, and MOND**, Antonino Del Popolo et.al., [2303.16658v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16658v1)

 In this paper, we use SPARC's HSBs, and LSBs galaxies to verify two issues. The first one is related to one claim of \citep{Donato} D09, namely: is the DM surface density (DMsd) a constant universal quantity, equal to $\log{(\rm \Sigma/M\_\odot pc^{-2})}=2.15 \pm 0.2$, or does it depend on the baryon surface density of the system? The second one, is based on a MOND prediction that for HSBs the DMsd is constant, and equal to $\log{(\rm \Sigma/M\_\odot pc^{-2})}=2.14$, while for LSBs the surface density is not constant and takes values that are smaller than for HSBs and D09 prediction \citep{Milgrom2009}. We find that HSBs shows a constant DMsd vs magnitude as in D09, and a constant DMsd vs $\Sigma\_{\rm eff}$ as in MOND prediction, for HSBs with $\Sigma\_{\rm eff}>200 L\_\odot/pc^2$, and $\Sigma\_{\rm eff}>300 L\_\odot/pc^2$. However, the value of the DMsd is larger, $\Sigma \simeq 2.61$ (in the case of the DMsd-magnitude with $\Sigma\_{\rm eff}>300 L\_\odot/pc^2$), and $\Sigma \simeq 2.54$ (in the case of the surface DMsd-surface brightness with $\Sigma\_{\rm eff}>200 L\_\odot/pc^2$). This value slightly depends on the threshold to determine wheter a galaxy is HSB. In the case of LSBs, for $\Sigma\_{\rm eff}<100 L\_\odot/pc^2$, and $\Sigma\_{\rm eff}<25 L\_\odot/pc^2$, the surface density vs magnitude, for lower magnitudes, is approximately equal to that predicted by D09, but several galaxies, for magnitude $M>-17$, have smaller values than those predicted by D09. The DMsd vs $\Sigma\_{\rm eff}$ shows a similar behavior in qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with MOND predictions. In summary, in the case of HSBs both D09 and MOND are in qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with the data. In the case of LSBs D09 is mainly in disagreement with the data, and MOND only in qualitative agreement with them.

2023-03-29, **T violation and the dark sector**, R. Vilela Mendes et.al., [2303.16586v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16586v1)

 It is argued, as a working hypothesis, that "normal" and dark matter interactions can only be T and CP violating. One way to implement this idea is to consider that time reversal in dark matter is implemented, not by an antiunitary operator, but by a unitary operator. It is shown how this occurs naturally in the context of complex spacetime with an extended symmetry group.

2023-03-29, **The large-scale structure of globular clusters in the NGC 1052 group**, Maria Luisa Buzzo et.al., [2303.16375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16375v1)

 Prompted by the many controversial claims involving the NGC 1052 group, including that it hosts two dark matter-free galaxies with overluminous and monochromatic globular cluster (GC) systems, here we map out the large-scale structure (LSS) of GCs over the entire group. To recover the LSS, we use archival optical CFHT imaging data. We recover two GC density maps, one based on universal photometric properties of GCs from simple stellar population models, and one based on the properties of spectroscopically confirmed GCs in DF2 and DF4 (the two dwarf galaxies with overluminous GC populations). Both selection methods reveal overdensities around the massive galaxies in the group, as well as around NGC 1052 itself, that are coincident with the positions of previously identified stellar streams and tidal features. No intragroup GCs are found connecting these structures to any of the dwarf galaxies. We find, however, two other dwarfs in the group hosting GC systems. These include RCP32 with 2 GCs with ages equivalent to the GCs around NGC 1052, and DF9 with 3 GCs with ages similar to the GCs around DF2 and DF4. We conclude that the GC distribution in the group does not strongly support any formation scenario in particular. It favours, nonetheless, scenarios relying on galaxy-galaxy interactions and on the coeval formation of GCs around the DM-free dwarf galaxies. These may include the recently proposed bullet-dwarf formation, as well as high-redshift tidal dwarf galaxy models.

2023-03-29, **Dark Matter in (Volatility and) Equity Option Risk Premiums**, Gurdip Bakshi et.al., [2303.16371v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16371v1)

 Emphasizing the statistics of jumps crossing the strike and local time, we develop a decomposition of equity option risk premiums. Operationalizing this theoretical treatment, we equip the pricing kernel process with unspanned risks, embed (unspanned) jump risks, and allow equity return volatility to contain unspanned risks. Unspanned risks are consistent with negative risk premiums for jumps crossing the strike and local time and imply negative risk premiums for out-of-the-money call options and straddles. The empirical evidence from weekly and farther-dated index options is supportive of our theory of economically relevant unspanned risks and reveals ``dark matter" in option risk premiums.

2023-03-28, **Optimal Mass Variables for Semivisible Jets**, Kevin Pedro et.al., [2303.16253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16253v1)

 Strongly coupled hidden sector theories predict collider production of invisible, composite dark matter candidates mixed with regular hadrons in the form of semivisible jets. Classical mass reconstruction techniques may not be optimal for these unusual topologies, in which the missing transverse momentum comes from massive particles and has a nontrivial relationship to the visible jet momentum. We apply the artificial event variable network, a semisupervised, interpretable machine learning technique that uses an information bottleneck, to derive superior mass reconstruction functions for several cases of resonant semivisible jet production. We demonstrate that the technique can extrapolate to unknown signal model parameter values. We further demonstrate the viability of conducting an actual search for new physics using this method, by applying the learned functions to standard model background events from quantum chromodynamics.

2023-03-28, **The ALMA-ALPAKA survey I: high-resolution CO and [CI] kinematics of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.5-3.5**, F. Rizzo et.al., [2303.16227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16227v1)

 Spatially-resolved studies of the kinematics of galaxies provide crucial insights into their assembly and evolution, enabling to infer the properties of the dark matter halos, derive the impact of feedback on the ISM, characterize the outflow motions. To date, most of the kinematic studies at z=0.5-3.5 were obtained using emission lines tracing the warm, ionized gas. However, whether these provide an exhaustive or only a partial view of the dynamics of galaxies and of the properties of the ISM is still debated. Complementary insights on the cold gas kinematics are therefore needed. We present ALPAKA, a project aimed at gathering high-resolution observations of CO and [CI] emission lines of star-forming galaxies at z=0.5-3.5 from the ALMA public archive. With 147 hours of total integration time, ALPAKA assembles ~0.25'' observations for 28 star-forming galaxies, the largest sample with spatially-resolved cold gas kinematics as traced by either CO or [CI] at z>0.5. By combining multi-wavelength ancillary data, we derive the stellar masses ($M\_{\star}$) and star-formation rates (SFR) for our targets, finding values of $M\_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{10}$ M$\_{\odot}$ and SFR of 10-3000 M$\_{\odot}$/yr. A large fraction of ALPAKA galaxies (19/28) lie in overdense regions (clusters, groups, and protoclusters). We exploit the ALMA data to infer their dynamical state and we find that 19/28 ALPAKA galaxies are rotating disks, 2 are interacting systems, while for the remaining 7 sources the classification is uncertain. The disks have velocity dispersion values that are typically larger in the innermost regions than in the outskirts, with a median value for the entire disk sample of 35$^{+11}\_{-9}$ km/s. Despite the bias of our sample towards galaxies hosting very energetic mechanisms, the ALPAKA disks have high ratios of ordered-to-random motion ($V/\sigma$) with a median value of 9$^{+7}\_{-2}$.

2023-03-28, **Milky Way and Andromeda analogs from the TNG50 simulation**, Annalisa Pillepich et.al., [2303.16217v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16217v1)

 We present the properties of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like (MW/M31-like) galaxies simulated within TNG50, the highest-resolution run of the IllustrisTNG suite of $\Lambda$CDM magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. We introduce our fiducial selection for MW/M31 analogs, which we propose for direct usage as well as for reference in future analyses. TNG50 contains 198 MW/M31 analogs, i.e. galaxies with stellar disky morphology, with a stellar mass in the range of $M\_* = 10^{10.5 - 11.2}$ Msun, and within a MW-like Mpc-scale environment at z=0. These are resolved with baryonic (dark matter) mass resolution of $8.5\times10^4$ Msun ($4.5\times10^5$ Msun) and $\sim150$ pc of average spatial resolution in the star-forming regions: we therefore expand by many factors (2 orders of magnitude) the sample size of cosmologically-simulated analogs with similar ($\times 10$ better) numerical resolution. The majority of TNG50 MW/M31 analogs at $z=0$ exhibit a bar, 60 per cent are star-forming, the sample includes 3 Local Group (LG)-like systems, and a number of galaxies host one or more satellites as massive as e.g. the Magellanic Clouds. Even within such a relatively narrow selection, TNG50 reveals a great diversity in galaxy and halo properties, as well as in past histories. Within the TNG50 sample, it is possible to identify several simulated galaxies whose integral and structural properties are consistent, one or more at a time, with those measured for the Galaxy and Andromeda. With this paper, we document and release a series of broadly applicable data products that build upon the IllustrisTNG public release and aim to facilitate easy access and analysis by public users. These include datacubes across snapshots ($0 \le z \le 7$) for each TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxy, and a series of value-added catalogs that will be continually expanded to provide a convenient and up to date community resource.

2023-03-28, **The mass accretion history of dark matter haloes down to Earth mass**, Yizhou Liu et.al., [2303.15894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15894v1)

 We take advantage of the unprecedented dynamical range provided by the "Cosmic-Zoom" project to study the mass accretion history (MAH) of present-day dark matter haloes over the entire mass range present in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm when the dark matter is made of weakly interacting massive particles of mass $100\ \mathrm{GeV}$. In particular, we complement previous studies by exploring the MAHs of haloes with mass from $10^8\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M\_{\odot}}$ down to Earth mass, $10^{-6}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M\_{\odot}}$. The formation redshift of low-mass haloes anti-correlates weakly with mass, peaking at $z=3$ for haloes of mass $10^{-4}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M\_{\odot}}$. Even lower masses are affected by the free-streaming cutoff in the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations and form at lower redshift. We compare MAHs in our simulations with predictions from two analytical models based on the extended Press-Schechter theory (EPS), and three empirical models derived by fitting and extrapolating either results from cosmological $N$-body simulations or Monte Carlo realizations of halo growth. All models fit our simulations reasonably well over the mass range for which they were calibrated. While the empirical models match better for more massive haloes, $M>10^{10}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M\_{\odot}}$, the analytical models do better when extrapolated down to Earth mass. At the higher masses, we explore the correlation between local environment density and MAH, finding that biases are relatively weak, with typical MAHs for haloes in extremely low-density and in typical regions differing by less than $20$ percent at high redshift. We conclude that EPS theory predicts the hierarchical build-up of dark matter haloes quite well over the entire mass range.

2023-03-28, **Dark Matter in Fractional Gravity I: Astrophysical Tests on Galactic Scales**, Francesco Benetti et.al., [2303.15767v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15767v1)

 [abridged] We explore the possibility that the dark matter (DM) component in galaxies may originate fractional gravity. In such a framework, the standard law of inertia continues to hold, but the gravitational potential associated to a given DM density distribution is determined by a modified Poisson equation including fractional derivatives (i.e., derivatives of non-integer type), that are meant to describe non-local effects. We derive analytically the expression of the potential that in fractional gravity corresponds to various spherically symmetric density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) distribution that is usually exploited to describe virialized halos of collisionless DM as extracted from $N-$body cosmological simulations. We show that in fractional gravity the dynamics of a test particle moving in a cuspy NFW density distribution is substantially altered with respect to the Newtonian case (i.e., basing on the standard Poisson equation), mirroring what in Newtonian gravity would instead be sourced by a density profile with an inner core. We test the fractional gravity framework on galactic scales, showing that: (i) it can provide accurate fits to the stacked rotation curves of galaxies with different properties; (ii) it can reproduce to reasonable accuracy the observed shape and scatter of the radial acceleration relation (RAR); (iii) it can properly account for the universal surface density and the core radius vs. disk scale-length scaling relations. Finally, we discuss the possible origin of the fractional gravity behavior as a fundamental or emerging property of the elusive DM component.

2023-03-29, **Dwarf Galaxy Discoveries from the KMTNet Supernova Program III. the Milky-Way Analog NGC~2997 Group**, Tony Junjing Fan et.al., [2303.16849v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16849v1)

 We present the discovery of 48 new and the analysis of 55, including 7 previously discovered, dwarf galaxy candidates around the giant spiral galaxy NGC~2997 using deep $BVI$ images from the KMTNet Supernova Program. Their $V$-band central surface brightness and total absolute magnitudes range between 20.3--26.7 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and --(8.02--17.69) mag, respectively, while the $I$-band effective radii are between 0.14 and 2.97 kpc. We obtain $\alpha$ $\simeq$ --1.43 $\pm$ 0.02 for the faint-end slope of their luminosity function, comparable to previously measured values but shallower than theoretical predictions based on $\Lambda$CDM models. The distance-independent distributions of their mass and color from the host galaxy NGC~2997 suggest that the group could be dynamically young, prior to the development of significant mass segregation or radial color gradients. The systematically bluer colors of the brighter candidates than the fainter ones indicate higher star formation activities in brighter members. We suggest that the higher-mass dwarf galaxies in the group have maintained star-formation activities by effectively retaining gas content, while environmental quenching is only effective for the lower-mass galaxies. The interpretation of early evolutionary stage of this group is also consistent with the overall morphological distribution of the dwarf galaxy candidates showing a lack of morphologically evolved candidates but a plethora of irregularly shaped ones. Our detection rate of dwarf galaxy candidates in the NGC~2997 group and their inferred star formation activities are largely comparable to those found in Milky Way analog systems from the SAGA survey within the magnitude limit M$\_{V}$ $\lesssim$ --13 mag, as well as those found in the ELVES survey.

2023-03-29, **Fluxes and spectral indices of rare and abundant cosmic ray nuclei according to the NUCLEON space experiment**, I. A. Kudryashov et.al., [2303.16539v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16539v1)

 In this paper the dependence of the spectra of cosmic ray nuclei on the charges of nuclei was studied, according to the data of the NUCLEON space experiment. First, we studied the dependence of the spectral index of magnetic rigidity spectra on the charge for abundant nuclei. Secondly, for the charge range $Z=9\div20$, the differences in the total spectra of rare odd and abundant even nuclei were studied. Using the GALPROP package, the inverse problem of CR propagation from a source (near supernova) to an observer was solved, a component-by-component spectrum in the source was reconstructed, and it was shown that a systematic change in the spectral index in the source exist. It is supposed that this change may be interpreted as incomplete ionization of cosmic rays at the stage of acceleration in the supernova remnant shock. The ratio of the total spectra of magnetic rigidity for low-abundance odd and abundant even nuclei from the charge range $Z=9\div20$ is obtained, and it was shown that the spectra of odd rare nuclei are harder than the stpectra of abundat even nuclei in the rigidity range 300--10000~GV.

 We report on the result of He abundance analysis of dense circumstellar clumps in the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. These clumps, which are called quasi-stationary flocculi (QSFs), are known from previous optical studies to be enriched in He along with N, but the degree of He overabundance relative to H has remained uncertain. For several QSFs with near-infrared spectroscopic data, we have analyzed their He I 1.083 $\mu$m/Pa$\gamma$ ratios together with the ratios of [Fe II] lines by using the Raymond shock code. According to our analysis, He is overabundant relative to H by a factor of $\lesssim 3$ in most of these QSFs. This He abundance of QSFs is consistent with the previous conclusion from the N overabundance that QSFs were ejected when a substantial amount of the H envelope of the progenitor star had been stripped off. We discuss the mass-loss history of the progenitor star and the origin of QSFs.

 The progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms responsible for the thermonuclear events observationally classified as Type Ia supernovae are uncertain and difficult to uniquely constrain using traditional observations of Type Ia supernova host galaxies, progenitors, light curves, and remnants. For the subset of thermonuclear events that are prolific producers of iron, we use published theoretical nucleosynthetic yields to identify a set of elemental abundance ratios infrequently observed in metal-poor stars but shared across a range of progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms: [Na,Mg,Co/Fe]<0. We label stars with this abundance signature ``iron-rich metal-poor'' or IRMP stars. We suggest that IRMP stars formed in environments dominated by thermonuclear nucleosynthesis and consequently that their elemental abundances can be used to constrain both the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms responsible for thermonuclear explosions. We identify three IRMP in the literature and homogeneously infer their elemental abundances. We find that the elemental abundances of BD+80 245, HE 0533--5340, and SMSS J034249.53--284216.0 are best explained by the (double) detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO white dwarfs. If our interpretation of IRMP stars is accurate, then they should be very rare in globular clusters and more common in the Magellanic Clouds and dwarf spheroidal galaxies than in the Milky Way's halo. We propose that future studies of IRMP stars will quantify the relative occurrences of different thermonuclear event progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms.

2023-03-28, **EMRI + TDE = QPE: Periodic X-ray Flares from Star-Disk Collisions in Galactic Nuclei**, Itai Linial et.al., [2303.16231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16231v1)

 Roughly half of the quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources in galactic nuclei exhibit a remarkably regular alternating "long-short'' pattern of recurrence times between consecutive flares. In support of previous suggestions, we show that a main-sequence star (brought into the nucleus as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral; EMRI) which passes twice per orbit through the accretion disk of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) on a mildly eccentric inclined orbit, each time shocking and ejecting optically-thick gas clouds above and below the midplane (akin to dual ``supernovae''), naturally reproduces the luminosities, durations, and spectral temperatures of observed QPE flares. Similar to supernova shock break-out from a compact star, inefficient photon production in the collision debris renders the QPE emission much harder than the blackbody temperature, enabling the Comptonized spectrum to stick out from the softer quiescent disk spectrum. Destruction of the star via mass ablation typically limits the lifetime of QPE emission to decades, precluding a long-lived AGN as the source of the gaseous disk. By contrast, a tidal disruption event (TDE) naturally provides a transient gaseous disk on the requisite radial scale, with a rate sufficiently high relative to the EMRI inward migration rate, that a significant fraction of TDEs should host a QPE. This picture is consistent with the X-ray TDE observed several years prior to the QPE emission from GSN 069. Remarkably, a second TDE-like flare was observed from this event, starting immediately after detectable QPE activity ceased; this accretion event could plausibly result from the (partial or complete) destruction of the QPE-generating star triggered by runaway mass-loss. Our model can also be applied to black hole-disk collisions, such as those proposed to generate quasi-periodic flares in the candidate SMBH binary OJ 287.

2023-03-28, **Insights on the Sun birth environment in the context of star-cluster formation in hub-filament systems**, Doris Arzoumanian et.al., [2303.15695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15695v1)

 Cylindrical molecular filaments are observed to be the main sites of Sun-like star formation, while massive stars form in dense hubs, at the junction of multiple filaments. The role of hub-filament configurations has not been discussed yet in relation to the birth environment of the solar system and to infer the origin of isotopic ratios of Short-Lived Radionuclides (SLR, such as $^{26}$Al) of Calcium-Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAIs) observed in meteorites. In this work, we present simple analytical estimates of the impact of stellar feedback on the young solar system forming along a filament of a hub-filament system. We find that the host filament can shield the young solar system from the stellar feedback, both during the formation and evolution of stars (stellar outflow, wind, and radiation) and at the end of their life (supernovae). We show that the young solar system formed along a dense filament can be enriched with supernova ejecta (e.g., $^{26}$Al) during the formation timescale of CAIs. We also propose that the streamers recently observed around protostars may be channeling the SLR-rich material onto the young solar system. We conclude that considering hub-filament configurations as the birth environment of the Sun is important when deriving theoretical models explaining the observed properties of the solar system.

2023-03-28, **Synthetic Population of Binary Cepheids. II. The effect of companion light on the extragalactic distance scale**, Paulina Karczmarek et.al., [2303.15664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15664v1)

 Because of their period-luminosity relation (PLR), classical Cepheids play a key role in the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale and the determination of the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant $H\_0$. Recent findings show that the majority of classical Cepheids should be in binary or multiple systems, which might undermine their accuracy, as the extra -- and unaccounted for -- light from the companions of Cepheids causes a shift in the PLR. We quantify this shift using synthetic populations of binary Cepheids that we developed for this purpose, as described in Paper I of this series. We find that while all PLRs are shifted toward brighter values due to the excess light from the companions, the bias in the relative distance modulus between two galaxies hosting binary Cepheids can be either positive or negative, depending on the percentage of binary Cepheids in them. If the binarity percentage in the two galaxies is similar, the effect of binarity is canceled. Otherwise, it introduces a shift in the distance modulus of the order of millimags in the near-infrared passbands and Wesenheit indices, and tens of millimags in the visual domain; its exact value depends on the variant of the synthetic population (a unique combination of metallicity, star formation history, shape and location of the instability strip, and initial parameter distributions). Such shifts in distance moduli to type Ia supernova host galaxies introduce an additional statistical error on $H\_0$, which however does not prevent measuring $H\_0$ with a precision of 1%.
