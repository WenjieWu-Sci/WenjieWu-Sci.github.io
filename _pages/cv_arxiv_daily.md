2025-06-09, **Resonant neutrino self-interactions: insights from the full shape galaxy power spectrum**, Hern√°n E. Noriega et.al., [2506.07994v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07994v1)

 This paper investigates resonant neutrino self-interactions in cosmology by employing, for the first time, the effective field theory of large-scale structure to model their impact on the matter distribution up to mildly nonlinear scales. We explore a broad range of mediator masses in two main analyses: one combining BOSS Full Shape (FS) galaxy clustering with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and another combining FS with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Our results place the strongest cosmological constraints to date on the resonant self interactions when using FS+Planck data, reaching up to $g\_\nu< 10.8 \times 10^{-14}$ at $95\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator. Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g\_\nu < 7.33 \times 10^{-12}$ at $95\%$ confidence. Our results suggest that resonant neutrino self-interactions are unlikely to resolve existing cosmological tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.

2025-06-09, **Probing Planck scale effects on absolute mass limit in neutrino flavor evolution**, Kartik Joshi et.al., [2506.07588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07588v1)

 This work explores how the generalized uncertainty principle, a theoretical modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle inspired by quantum gravity, affects neutrino flavor oscillations. By extending the standard two-flavor neutrino model, we show that the oscillation probability acquires an additional phase term that depends on the square roots of the neutrino masses, introducing new features beyond the conventional mass-squared differences. To account for the non-Hermitian nature of the resulting dynamics, we employ parity-time (PT) symmetric quantum mechanics, which allows for consistent descriptions of systems with balanced gain and loss. We analyze the feasibility of observing these effects in current and future neutrino experiments, such as DUNE, JUNO, IceCube, and KATRIN, and find that the predicted modifications could lie within experimental sensitivity. Moreover, we propose that analog quantum simulation platforms, such as cold atoms, trapped ions, and photonic systems, offer a promising route to test these predictions under controlled conditions. Our findings suggest that neutrino oscillations may serve as an effective probe of quantum gravity effects, providing a novel connection between fundamental theory and experimental observables.

2025-06-09, **Power Spectrum Emulators from Neural Networks and Tree-Based Methods**, Andrei Lazanu et.al., [2506.07514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07514v1)

 We use two subsets of 2000 and 1000 \textsc{Quijote} simulations to build two power spectrum emulators, allowing for fast computations of the non-linear matter power spectrum. The first emulator works on scales $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$ in terms of seven cosmological parameters: the matter and baryon fraction of the energy density of the Universe $\Omega\_m$ and $\Omega\_b$, the reduced Hubble constant $h$, the scalar spectral index $n\_s$, the amplitude of matter density fluctuations $\sigma\_8$, the total neutrino mass $M\_{\nu}$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. The power spectra can be directly determined at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3, while for intermediate redshifts these can be interpolated. The second emulator is based on five cosmological parameters, $\Omega\_m$, $h$, $n\_s$, $\sigma\_8$ and the amplitude of equilateral non-Gaussianity $f\_{\rm NL}^{\rm equilateral}$, at redshifts 0, 0.503, 0.733, 0.997 for $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$. The emulators are built on machine learning techniques. In both cases we have investigated both neural networks and tree-based methods and we have shown that the best accuracy is obtained for a neural network with two hidden layers. Both emulators achieve a root-mean-squared relative error of less then 5\% for all the redshifts considered on the scales discussed.

2025-06-08, **Comparative Testing of Subgrid Models for Fast Neutrino Flavor Conversions in Core-collapse Supernova Simulations**, Ryuichiro Akaho et.al., [2506.07017v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07017v1)

 We investigate key methodologies of Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook subgrid modeling for neutrino fast flavor conversions (FFC) in core-collapse supernova based on spherically symmetric Boltzmann radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We first examine time integration methods (explicit, implicit, or semi-implicit) and time step control for the subgrid term, and then compare various approaches in the literature approximating FFCs in two aspects: (1) angular dependent survival probability of neutrinos versus simple equipartition condition with a certain baryon mass density threshold, and (2) 4-species treatment versus 3-species assumption ($\nu\_x=\bar\nu\_x$). We find that the equipartition condition is reasonable for out-going neutrinos, but large deviations emerge in the incoming neutrinos, that has an influence on matter profiles. We also find that the 3-species model, in which flavor conversions evolve towards erasing electron neutrino lepton number (ELN) crossings, behave differently from the 4-species models where heavy leptonic neutrino number (XLN) are appropriately treated in FFC subgrid modeling. In 4-species models, we commonly observe noticeable differences between $\nu\_x$ and $\bar\nu\_x$, highlighting the limitation in 3-species treatments to study impacts of flavor conversion on neutrino signals. Our result also suggests that FFC models yield lower neutrino heating rate and smaller shock radii compared to cases with no FFC, in agreement with earlier studies employing quantum kinetic neutrino transport. This work provides valuable information towards robust implementation of FFC subgrid model into classical transport, and serves as a pilot study for future multi-dimensional simulations.

2025-06-09, **Not so dark, not so dense: an alternative explanation for the lensing subhalo in SDSSJ0946+1006**, Qiuhan He et.al., [2506.07978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07978v1)

 Previous studies of the strong lens system SDSSJ0946+1006 have reported a dark matter subhalo with an unusually high central density, potentially challenging the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. However, these analyses assumed the subhalo to be completely dark, neglecting the possibility that it may host a faint galaxy. In this work, we revisit the lensing analysis of SDSSJ0946+1006, explicitly modelling the subhalo as a luminous satellite. Incorporating light from the perturber broadens the range of allowed subhalo properties, revealing solutions with significantly lower central densities that are consistent with CDM expectations. The inferred luminosity of the satellite also aligns with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. While high-concentration subhaloes remain allowed, they are no longer statistically preferred. The luminous subhalo model yields a better fit to the data, while also offering a more plausible explanation that is in line with theoretical expectations. We validate our methodology using mock data, demonstrating that neglecting subhalo light can lead to inferred mass distributions that are artificially compact.

2025-06-09, **Torsion Balance Experiments Enable Direct Detection of Sub-eV Dark Matter**, Shigeki Matsumoto et.al., [2506.07763v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07763v1)

 Light dark matter with sub-eV masses has a high number density in our galaxy, and its scattering cross section with macroscopic objects can be significantly enhanced by coherence effects. Repeated scattering with a target object can induce a measurable acceleration. Torsion balance experiments with geometric asymmetry are, in principle, capable of detecting such signals. Our analysis shows that existing torsion balances designed to test the Equivalence Principle already place the most stringent constraints on DM-nucleon scattering in the $(10^{-2}, 1)\,$eV mass range.

2025-06-09, **Thermal corrections to dark matter annihilation with real photon emission/absorption**, Prabhat Butola et.al., [2506.07663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07663v1)

 The dark matter relic density is being increasingly precisely measured. This relic density is theoretically determined by a Boltzmann equation which computes the dark matter distribution according to the (thermally averaged) cross section for annihilation/production of dark matter within a given model. We present here the complete higher order thermal corrections, calculated using real time thermal field theory, to the cross section for the annihilation of dark matter into Standard Model fermions via charged scalars: $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f}$ and $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f} (\gamma)$. The latter process includes real photon emission into, and absorption from, the heat bath at temperature $T$. We use the Grammer and Yennie technique to separate the soft infra-red divergences, which greatly simplifies the calculation. We show explicitly the cancellation of both soft and collinear divergences between real and virtual contributions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the thermal field theory and remark on the non-trivial nature of the collinear divergences when the thermal contribution from fermions is considered. We present the leading thermal contributions to order ${\cal{O}}(\alpha T^2)$ for the case when the dark matter particle is a Majorana or Dirac type fermion. In the former case, both the leading order (LO) and NLO cross sections are helicity suppressed, while neither is suppressed in the Dirac case. It is interesting that the ratio of NLO to LO cross sections is the same for both Majorana and Dirac type dark matter.

2025-06-09, **Non-Separable Halo Bias from High-Redshift Galaxy Clustering**, Emy Mons et.al., [2506.07662v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07662v1)

 The halo model provides a powerful framework for interpreting galaxy clustering by linking the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes to the underlying matter distribution. A key assumption within the linear bias approximation of the halo model is that the halo bias between two halo populations is a separable function of the mass of each population. In this work, we test the validity of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear scales using both simulations and observational data. Unlike previous studies, we explicitly disentangle the effects of scale dependence of the bias to assess the robustness of bias separability across a broad range of halo masses and redshifts. In particular, we define a separability function based on halo or galaxy cross-correlations to quantify deviations from halo bias separability, and measure it from N-body simulations. We find significant departures from separability on quasi-linear scales ($\sim$ 1-5 Mpc) at high redshifts ($z \geq 3$), leading to enhancements in halo cross-correlations by up to a factor of 2 -- or even higher. In contrast, deviations at low redshifts remain modest. Additionally, using high-redshift ($z \sim 3.6$) galaxy samples, we detect deviations from bias separability that closely align with simulation predictions. The breakdown of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear scales at high redshifts underscore the importance to account for non-separability in models of the galaxy-halo connection in this regime. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of high-redshift galaxy cross-correlations as a probe for improving the galaxy-halo connection from upcoming large-scale surveys.

2025-06-09, **Gravitational collapse of Matter in the presence of Scalar field Dark energy**, Priyanka Saha et.al., [2506.07629v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07629v1)

 This study examines the gravitational collapse of an overdense dark matter region in a coupled scalar field dark energy scenario within a flat FLRW background. It finds that, depending on the initial conditions, some overdense regions avoid collapse and expand eternally with the background. The interior overdense region follows a closed FLRW metric, while its boundary is described by generalized Vaidya spacetime, which allows flux across the boundary while preserving the homogeneity of dark energy inside. Dark matter evolves as cold dark matter, but in non-minimal coupling, the modified Klein-Gordon equation alters dark energy evolution. The results highlight the impact of coupled dark energy on dark matter virialization and cosmic structure formation.

2025-06-09, **Multi-band observation of lensed gravitational waves as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos**, Katsuya T. Abe et.al., [2506.07507v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07507v1)

 The gravitational lensing effect of gravitational waves (GWs) has been extensively discussed as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos, which can provide missing information about dark matter. We propose a multi-band observation of lensed GWs from a compact binary to observe both geometrical optics (GO) and wave optics (WO) effects from the same source. This method is expected to be advantageous in breaking parameter degeneracies between a GW source and a dark matter halo acting as a lens. We assume DECIGO or B-DECIGO as a space-based detector observing the early inspiral phase, and the ET as a ground-based detector observing the merger phase. We perform a Fisher analysis of multi-band detection for a source with masses $m\_1 = 30 M\_{\odot}, m\_2 = 20 M\_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.5$, and a lens with mass $3 \times 10^{3} M\_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.0$. With this setup, the GO effect appears in the ET frequency band, and the WO effect in that of DECIGO. For the halo density profile, we adopt Singular Isothermal Sphere, Cored Isothermal Sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White models. We find that multi-band observation resolves parameter degeneracies and significantly reduces errors in estimated parameters. For the CIS model, in particular, we show that, by combining ET and DECIGO observations, the lens mass error improves by about 71 $\%$ and 58 $\%$ compared to ET and DECIGO alone, respectively. Similarly, the impact parameter error is reduced by about 65 $\%$ and 70 $\%$, and the core size error by 34 $\%$ and 68 $\%$, respectively. From these results, we conclude that the multi-band observation of GWs from compact binaries improves the estimation of the lens object properties by breaking the parameter degeneracy.

2025-06-09, **Constraints on cosmology and baryonic feedback with joint analysis of Dark Energy Survey Year 3 lensing data and ACT DR6 thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations**, S. Pandey et.al., [2506.07432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07432v1)

 We present a joint analysis of weak gravitational lensing (shear) data obtained from the first three years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect measurements from a combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck data. A combined analysis of shear (which traces the projected mass) with the tSZ effect (which traces the projected gas pressure) can jointly probe both the distribution of matter and the thermodynamic state of the gas, accounting for the correlated effects of baryonic feedback on both observables. We detect the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation at a 21$\sigma$ significance, the highest to date, after minimizing the bias from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ map. By jointly modeling the small-scale shear auto-correlation and the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation, we obtain $S\_8 = 0.811^{+0.015}\_{-0.012}$ and $\Omega\_{\rm m} = 0.263^{+0.023}\_{-0.030}$, results consistent with primary CMB analyses from Planck and P-ACT. We find evidence for reduced thermal gas pressure in dark matter halos with masses $M < 10^{14} \, M\_{\odot}/h$, supporting predictions of enhanced feedback from active galactic nuclei on gas thermodynamics. A comparison of the inferred matter power suppression reveals a $2-4\sigma$ tension with hydrodynamical simulations that implement mild baryonic feedback, as our constraints prefer a stronger suppression. Finally, we investigate biases from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ-shear cross-correlation measurements, employing mitigation techniques to ensure a robust inference. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

2025-06-09, **Galaxy Cluster Mass Estimation Through The Splashback Radius**, Lucas Gabriel-Silva et.al., [2506.07425v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07425v1)

 We present an analysis of the splashback radius ($R\_{\text{sp}}$) and the associated splashback mass ($M\_{\text{sp}}$) for a sample of galaxy clusters using SDSS spectroscopic data and mock simulations. $R\_{\text{sp}}$ marks a physical boundary between the virialized core and the outer infall regions of clusters, providing a robust measure of cluster mass accretion history without being affected by pseudo-evolution. We model the cumulative galaxy number profile of clusters, testing different halo density models and considering the impact of cluster properties, such as center definitions, magnitude limits, galaxy colors, and field contamination, on the estimation of splashback features. Our results show that observed splashback radii, measured in projection (2D), are consistently smaller than predicted by dark matter simulations, with $R\_\text{sp}/R\_{200m} \approx 1$, supporting previous discrepancies in the literature. We also explore the relationship between $M\_{\text{sp}}$ and $R\_{\text{sp}}$, proposing a new scaling relation for future cosmological studies, as $R\_{\text{sp}}$ is easily observable. Our findings indicate that splashback masses strongly correlate with radii, with a dispersion of $\approx 0.15$ dex, competitive with other mass-observable relations. However, the fitted relation diverges from the constant density expectations of galaxy clusters around $R\_\text{sp}$. Additionally, the $M\_{\text{sp}} \textendash R\_{\text{sp}}$ relation shows significant redshift evolution, though the predominantly low-redshift range of our sample limits our ability to confirm this trend conclusively. The approach developed here may play a key role in cluster characterization and cosmology in the era of large galaxy surveys.

2025-06-09, **Measurement of Downward-going Milli-charged particles beyond GZK cutoff at the Pierre Auger Observatory**, Ye Xu et.al., [2506.07395v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07395v1)

 It is assumed that superheavy dark matter particles (SHDM, $\phi$) with $\mathcal{O}$(ZeV) mass may decay to relativistic milli-charged particles (MCPs, $\chi$) via a channel $\phi\to\chi\bar{\chi}$ or $\gamma\chi\bar{\chi}$. The downward-going MCPs passing through the atmosphere can be measured by the Pierre Auger observatory (Auger). The massless hidden photon model is taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei, so that we evaluated the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs at Auger assuming 14 years of Auger data. The hybrid data of Auger was fitted with the flux of UHE MCPs exceeding GZK-cutoff energy. Then the corresponding upper limits on $\epsilon^2$ are calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicate that MCPs can be directly detected with $\epsilon^2\gtrsim 2\times10^{-6}$ at Auger, when $m\_{\phi}=2\times10^{21}$ eV and $\tau\_{\phi}=10^{27}$ s. And a new region of 10$^{9.6}$ < $m\_{MCP}$ < 10$^{11.6}$ eV and $\epsilon$ > $2.12\times10^{-2}$ is ruled out in the $m\_{MCP}$-$\epsilon$ plane with 14 years of Auger data. These results indicate potential existence of MCPs and SHDM in the Universe.

2025-06-08, **Constraining Dark Matter Parameters in the Lambda-CDM Framework: A Bayesian Comparison of Planck and DES Constraints**, Manjeet Kunwar et.al., [2506.07133v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07133v1)

 We present a Bayesian analysis of cosmological parameter constraints from early- and late-universe observations, focusing on the matter density parameter ($\Omega\_m$) and the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma\_8$) within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Using data from the Planck 2018 satellite mission and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3, we compute theoretical predictions for angular and matter power spectra via Boltzmann solvers and perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling using the \texttt{emcee} Python package. Our key contribution is a direct and quantitative comparison of DES and Planck constraints, assessing their consistency using chi-squared analysis and Gaussian tension metrics. We find a statistically significant $6.46\sigma$ tension in $\Omega\_m$ and a $2.68\sigma$ tension in $\sigma\_8$ between the two datasets. These results provide fresh evidence of persistent discrepancies in cosmological parameter estimates and suggest that simple extensions to the $\Lambda$CDM model may be insufficient to fully reconcile early- and late-time observations, motivating the need for more complex theoretical models or refined treatment of systematics.

2025-06-08, **Indirect Detection of Dark Matter Around a Supermassive Black Hole with High Energy-Resolution Gamma-Ray Telescopes**, Yu Watanabe et.al., [2506.07009v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07009v1)

 We explore whether the unprecedented energy resolution of upcoming gamma-ray telescopes can uncover relativistic effects in photon spectra resulting from dark matter (DM) annihilation or decay near the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic Center (GC), specifically, gravitational redshift, Doppler broadening due to Lorentz boosts, and kinetic energy enhancements arising from high DM velocities. By modeling DM density and velocity profiles under various SMBH formation scenarios and DM properties, we calculate the corresponding gamma-ray spectra and identify the conditions under which SMBH-induced spectral distortions become observable. We find that, in favorable cases, the observed spectra encode the DM velocity distribution near the SMBH, enabling potential discrimination among annihilation mechanisms with different velocity dependencies. Even when SMBH-induced effects are modest, the upcoming COSI mission, with sub-percent energy resolution surpassing the typical DM velocity dispersion at the GC, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, may still be able to detect subtle Doppler broadening. These results highlight a promising pathway for determining the origin of gamma-ray signals and probing DM properties through high-resolution spectral measurements.

2025-06-09, **Fundamental Parameters for Central Stars of 103 Infrared Bowshock Nebulae**, Nikhil Patten et.al., [2506.07904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07904v1)

 Stellar bowshock nebulae are arcuate shock fronts formed by the interaction of radiation-driven stellar winds and the relative motion of the ambient interstellar material. Stellar bowshock nebulae provide a promising means to measure wind-driven mass loss, independent of other established methods. In this work, we characterize the stellar sources at the center of bowshock nebulae drawn from all-sky catalogs of 24 $\mu$m-selected nebulae. We obtain new, low-resolution blue optical spectra for \numstars~stars and measure stellar parameters temperature \teff, surface gravity \logg, and projected rotational broadening \vsini. We perform additional photometric analysis to measure stellar radius \rstar, luminosity \lstar, and visual-band extinction $A\_V$. All but one of our targets are O and early B stars, with temperatures ranging from $T$=16.5--46.8~k\kelvin, gravities $\log g=$2.57--4.60, and \vsini~from $<$100--400~\kms. With the exception of rapid rotator $\zeta$ Oph, bowshock stars do not rotate at or near critical velocities. At least 60 of 103 (60\%) OB bowshock stars are binaries, consistent with the multiplicity fraction of other OB samples. The sample shows a runaway fraction of 23\%, with \numrunaway~stars having $v\_{\text{2D}}\geq25$~\kms. Of the 19 runaways, at least 15 ($\geq$79\%) are binaries, favoring dynamical ejection over the binary supernova channel for producing runaways. We provide a comprehensive census of stellar parameters for bowshock stars, useful as a foundation for determining the mass-loss rates for OB-type stars -- one of the single most critical factors in stellar evolution governing the production of neutron stars and black holes.

2025-06-09, **Mitigating Polarization Leakage in Gas Pixel Detectors through Hybrid Machine Learning and Analytic Event Reconstruction**, Nicol√≥ Cibrario et.al., [2506.07828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07828v1)

 Spatially resolved polarization measurements of extended X-ray sources are expanding our understanding of the emission mechanisms and magnetic field properties involved. Such measurements have been possible in the past few years thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). However, the analysis of extended sources suffers a systematic effect known as polarization leakage, which artificially affects the measured polarization signal. To address this issue, we built a hybrid reconstruction algorithm, which combines machine learning and analytic techniques to improve the reconstruction of photoelectron tracks in the Gas Pixel Detector and to significantly mitigate polarization leakage. This work presents the first application of this hybrid method to experimental data, including both calibration lab measurements and IXPE observational data. We confirmed the reliable performance of the hybrid method for both cases. Additionally, we demonstrated the algorithm's effectiveness in reducing the polarization leakage effect through the analysis of the IXPE observation of the supernova remnant G21.5-0.9. By enabling more reliable polarization measurements, this method can potentially yield deeper insights into the magnetic field structures, particle acceleration processes, and emission mechanisms at work within extended X-ray sources.

2025-06-09, **$f(R, G, T)$ Gravity: Cosmological Implications and Dynamical System Analysis**, Ratul Mandal et.al., [2506.07623v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07623v1)

 We consider the cosmological implications of a four-dimensional extension of the Gauss-Bonnet f(G) gravity, where $G$ is the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant, in which the Einstein-Hilbert action is replaced by an arbitrary function $f(R,G,T)$ of G, of the Ricci scalar $R$, and of the trace $T$ of the matter energy-momentum tensor. By construction, the extended Gauss-Bonnet type action involves a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry. The field equations of the model are obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric. The generalized Friedmann equations, describing the cosmological evolution in the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry, are also presented in their general form. We investigate the cosmological evolution of the Universe in the generalized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theiry for a specific choice of the Lagrangian density, as given by $f(R, G, T) = \alpha\_1 G + \alpha\_2 R^{\beta} - 2\alpha\_3 \sqrt{-T}$, where $\alpha\_i$ (for $i = 1, 2, 3$) are model parameters. First, the theoretical predictions of the model are compared with a set of observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type IA Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) via an MCMC analysis, which allows us to obtain constraints on the model parameters. A comparison with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM system is also performed. Next, the generalized Friedmann equations are reformulated as a dynamical system, and the properties of its critical points are studied by using the Lyapunov linear stability analysis. This investigation allows for the reconstruction of the Universe's history in this model, from the early inflationary era to the late accelerating phase. The statefinder diagnostic parameters for the model are also considered from the dynamical system perspective.
