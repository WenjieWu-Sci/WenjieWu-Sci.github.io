2024-05-28, **Threshold Effects on the Massless Neutrino in the Canonical Seesaw Mechanism**, Di Zhang et.al., [2405.18017v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18017v1)

 In this work, we revisit the one-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) among non-degenerate seesaw scales, i.e., threshold effects in the canonical seesaw mechanism, which have been obtained for more than two decades. We find some contributions from the Weinberg operator to its Wilson coefficient, the neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix, and the Higgs quartic coupling absent in the previous calculations. Based on the updated one-loop RGEs, we derive the RGE of the effective neutrino mass matrix's determinant without any approximation. Then, for the first time, we provide a strict proof that the one-loop RG running effects among non-degenerate seesaw scales can not generate a non-zero mass for the initial massless neutrino in the minimal type-I seesaw mechanism or in the canonical one with a rank-degenerate neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix. One has to include two- or higher-loop corrections to achieve a non-zero mass for the massless neutrino.

2024-05-28, **Potential to Identify the Neutrino Mass Ordering with Reactor Antineutrinos in JUNO**, The JUNO Collaboration et.al., [2405.18008v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18008v1)

 The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a multi-purpose neutrino experiment under construction in South of China. This paper presents an updated estimate of JUNO's sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering using the reactor antineutrinos emitted from eight nuclear reactor cores in the Taishan and Yangjiang nuclear power plants. This measurement is planned by studying the fine interference pattern caused by quasi-vacuum oscillations in the oscillated antineutrino spectrum at a baseline of 52.5~km and is completely independent of the CP violating phase and the neutrino mixing angle $\theta\_{23}$. The sensitivity is obtained through a joint analysis of JUNO and TAO detectors utilizing the best available knowledge to date about the location and overburden of the JUNO experimental site, the local and global nuclear reactors, the JUNO and TAO detectors responses, the expected event rates and spectra of signal and backgrounds, and the systematic uncertainties of the analysis inputs. It is found that a 3$\sigma$ median sensitivity to reject the wrong mass ordering hypothesis can be reached with an exposure of about 6.5 years $\times$ 26.6~GW thermal power.

2024-05-28, **Charge Amplification in Low Pressure CF4:SF6:He Mixtures with a Multi-Mesh ThGEM for Directional Dark Matter Searches**, F. D. Amaro et.al., [2405.17967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17967v1)

 The CYGNO collaboration is developing next generation directional Dark Matter (DM) detection experiments, using gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), as a robust method for identifying Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) below the Neutrino Fog. SF6 is potentially ideal for this since it provides a high fluorine content, enhancing sensitivity to spin-dependent interactions and, as a Negative Ion Drift (NID) gas, reduces charge diffusion leading to improved positional resolution. CF4, although not a NID gas, has also been identified as a favourable gas target as it provides a scintillation signal which can be used for a complimentary light/charge readout approach. These gases can operate at low pressures to elongate Nuclear Recoil (NR) tracks and facilitate directional measurements. In principle, He could be added to low pressure SF6/CF4 without significant detriment to the length of 16S, 12C, and 19F recoils. This would improve the target mass, sensitivity to lower WIMP masses, and offer the possibility of atmospheric operation; potentially reducing the cost of a containment vessel. In this article, we present gas gain and energy resolution measurements, taken with a Multi-Mesh Thick Gaseous Electron Multiplier (MMThGEM), in low pressure SF6 and CF4:SF6 mixtures following the addition of He. We find that the CF4:SF6:He mixtures tested were able to produce gas gains on the order of 10^4 up to a total pressure of 100 Torr. These results demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in charge amplification in NID gas mixtures with a He component.

2024-05-28, **Strong limits on keV-scale galactic sterile neutrino dark matter with stray light from NuSTAR after 11 years of operation**, R. A. Krivonos et.al., [2405.17861v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17861v1)

 Using tremendous photon statistics gained with the stray light aperture of the NuSTAR telescope over 11 years of operation, we set strong limits on the emission of close to monochromatic photons from the radiative decays of putative dark matter sterile neutrinos in the Milky Way. In the energy range of 3-20 keV covered by the NuSTAR, the obtained limits reach the edge of theoretical predictions of realistic models leaving only a small room left to explore.

2024-05-28, **Prediction of Energy Resolution in the JUNO Experiment**, JUNO Collaboration et.al., [2405.17860v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17860v1)

 This paper presents the energy resolution study in the JUNO experiment, incorporating the latest knowledge acquired during the detector construction phase. The determination of neutrino mass ordering in JUNO requires an exceptional energy resolution better than 3\% at 1 MeV. To achieve this ambitious goal, significant efforts have been undertaken in the design and production of the key components of the JUNO detector. Various factors affecting the detection of inverse beta decay signals have an impact on the energy resolution, extending beyond the statistical fluctuations of the detected number of photons, such as the properties of liquid scintillator, performance of photomultiplier tubes, and the energy reconstruction algorithm. To account for these effects, a full JUNO simulation and reconstruction approach is employed. This enables the modeling of all relevant effects and the evaluation of associated inputs to accurately estimate the energy resolution. The study reveals an energy resolution of 2.95\% at 1 MeV. Furthermore, the study assesses the contribution of major effects to the overall energy resolution budget. This analysis serves as a reference for interpreting future measurements of energy resolution during JUNO data taking. Moreover, it provides a guideline in comprehending the energy resolution characteristics of liquid scintillator-based detectors.

2024-05-28, **The flavor-dependent $U(1)_F$ model**, Jin-Lei Yang et.al., [2405.17807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17807v1)

 A flavor-dependent model (FDM) is proposed in this work. The model extends the Standard Model by an extra $U(1)\_F$ local gauge group, two scalar doublets, one scalar singlet and two right-handed neutrinos, where the additional $U(1)\_F$ charges are related to the particles' flavor. The new fermion sector in the FDM can explain the flavor mixings puzzle and the mass hierarchy puzzle simultaneously, and the nonzero Majorana neutrino masses can be obtained naturally by the Type I see-saw mechanism. In addition, the $B$ meson rare decay processes $\bar B \to X\_s\gamma$, $B\_s^0 \to \mu^+\mu^-$, the top quark rare decay processes $t\to ch$, $t\to uh$ and the $\tau$ lepton flavor violation processes $\tau\to 3e$, $\tau\to 3\mu$, $\mu\to 3e$ predicted in the FDM are analyzed.

2024-05-28, **JUNO Sensitivity to Invisible Decay Modes of Neutrons**, JUNO Collaboration et.al., [2405.17792v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17792v1)

 We explore the bound neutrons decay into invisible particles (e.g., $n\rightarrow 3 \nu$ or $nn \rightarrow 2 \nu$) in the JUNO liquid scintillator detector. The invisible decay includes two decay modes: $ n \rightarrow { inv} $ and $ nn \rightarrow { inv} $. The invisible decays of $s$-shell neutrons in $^{12}{\rm C}$ will leave a highly excited residual nucleus. Subsequently, some de-excitation modes of the excited residual nuclei can produce a time- and space-correlated triple coincidence signal in the JUNO detector. Based on a full Monte Carlo simulation informed with the latest available data, we estimate all backgrounds, including inverse beta decay events of the reactor antineutrino $\bar{\nu}\_e$, natural radioactivity, cosmogenic isotopes and neutral current interactions of atmospheric neutrinos. Pulse shape discrimination and multivariate analysis techniques are employed to further suppress backgrounds. With two years of exposure, JUNO is expected to give an order of magnitude improvement compared to the current best limits. After 10 years of data taking, the JUNO expected sensitivities at a 90% confidence level are $\tau/B( n \rightarrow { inv} ) > 5.0 \times 10^{31} \, {\rm yr}$ and $\tau/B( nn \rightarrow { inv} ) > 1.4 \times 10^{32} \, {\rm yr}$.

2024-05-28, **Manifestation of antiquark nuggets in collisions with the Earth**, V. V. Flambaum et.al., [2405.17775v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17775v1)

 Antiquark nuggets are hypothetical compact composite objects conjectured to account for a significant fraction of dark matter in the Universe. In contrast to quark nuggets, these objects consist of antimatter. They may remain undetected if they possess a sufficiently small cross section relative to their mass. In this paper, we investigate the allowed region in the parameter space of this model that is consistent with the observed neutrino flux from the Sun and the Earth, and the non-observation of seismic events with specific signatures of dark matter particles. We found the allowed values of the antibaryon charge number in this model to be in the interval $2\times 10^{24}<A<8\times 10^{25}$, while the probability of nucleon annihilation upon collisions with the antiquark core is constrained by $0.1\lesssim \kappa<0.25$. Although very large values of the antibaryon charge, $A>10^{33}$, are not fully excluded by the present study, we show that they conflict with the non-observation of rare catastrophic explosion-like events on the Earth.

2024-05-28, **Implications of neutrino species number and summed mass measurements in cosmological observations**, N. Sasao et.al., [2405.17760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17760v1)

 We confront measurable neutrino degrees of freedom $N\_{\rm eff}$ and summed neutrino mass in the early universe to particle physics at the energy scale beyond the standard model (BSM), in particular including the issue of neutrino mass type distinction. The Majorana-type of massive neutrino is perfectly acceptable by Planck observations, while the Dirac-type neutrino may survive in a restricted class of models that suppresses extra right-handed contribution to $\Delta N\_{\rm eff} = N\_{\rm eff} - 3$ at a nearly indistinguishable level from the Majorana case. There is a chance that supersymmetry energy scale may be identified in supersymmetric extension of left-right symmetric model if improved $N\_{\rm eff}$ measurements discover a finite value. Combined analysis of this quantity with the summed neutrino mass helps to determine the neutrino mass ordering pattern, if measurement accuracy of order, $60 \sim 80\,$meV, is achieved, as in CMB-S4.

2024-05-27, **From the Dawn of Neutrino Astronomy to A New View of the Extreme Universe**, C. A. Argüelles et.al., [2405.17623v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17623v1)

 Over the past decade, neutrino astronomy has emerged as a new window into the extreme and hidden universe. Current generation experiments have detected high-energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin and identified the first sources, opening the field to discovery. Looking ahead, the authors of this Perspective identify seven major open questions in neutrino astrophysics and particle physics that could lead to transformative discoveries over the next 20 years. These multi-disciplinary questions range from understanding the vicinity of a black hole to unveiling the nature of neutrino mass, among other topics. Additionally, we critically review the current experimental capabilities and their limitations and, from there, discuss the interplay between different proposed neutrino telescope technologies and analysis techniques. The authors firmly believe that achieving the immense discovery potential over the next two decades demands a model of global partnership and complementary specialized detectors. This collaborative neutrino telescope network will pave the way for a thriving multi-messenger era, transforming our understanding of neutrino physics, astrophysics, and the extreme universe. \end{abstract}

2024-05-27, **Review of searches for vector-like quarks, vector-like leptons, and heavy neutral leptons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at the CMS experiment**, CMS Collaboration et.al., [2405.17605v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17605v1)

 The LHC has provided an unprecedented amount of proton-proton collision data, bringing forth exciting opportunities to address fundamental open questions in particle physics. These questions can potentially be answered by performing searches for very rare processes predicted by models that attempt to extend the standard model of particle physics. The data collected by the CMS experiment in 2015-2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV help to test the standard model at the highest precision ever and potentially discover new physics. An interesting opportunity is presented by the possibility of new fermions with masses ranging from the MeV to the TeV scale. Such new particles appear in many possible extensions of the standard model and are well motivated theoretically. They may explain the appearance of three generations of leptons and quarks, the mass hierarchy across the generations, and the nonzero neutrino masses. In this report, the status of searches targeting vector-like quarks, vector-like leptons, and heavy neutral leptons at the CMS experiment is discussed. A complete overview of final states is provided together with their complementarity and partial combination. The discovery potential for several of these searches at the High-Luminosity LHC is also discussed.

2024-05-27, **Searching for signatures of new physics in $B \to K \, ν\, \overlineν$ to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos**, C. S. Kim et.al., [2405.17341v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17341v1)

 We conduct a model-independent analysis of the distinct signatures of various generic new physics possibilities in the decay $B \to K \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ by analyzing the branching ratio as well as the missing mass-square distribution. Considering the final neutrinos to be of the same flavor with non-zero mass, we discuss the new physics contributions for both Dirac and Majorana neutrino possibilities. In our study, we utilize the analytical relations among form factors in semi-leptonic $B \to K$ transitions, which are consistent with current lattice QCD predictions to a very high numerical accuracy. We provide constraints on different new physics parameters, taking into account the recent measurement of $B^+ \to K^+ \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ branching ratio by the Belle-II collaboration. In future, if the missing mass-square distribution for $B^+ \to K^+ \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ decay gets reported by Belle-II with analysis of more events than their present data set, one can not only investigate possible new physics effects in these decays, but also probe the Dirac/Majorana nature of the neutrinos using quantum statistics, since a difference between the two cases is known to exist in the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions.

2024-05-27, **Quantum Parity Detectors: a qubit based particle detection scheme with meV thresholds for rare-event searches**, Karthik Ramanathan et.al., [2405.17192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17192v1)

 The next generation of rare-event searches, such as those aimed at determining the nature of particle dark matter or in measuring fundamental neutrino properties, will benefit from particle detectors with thresholds at the meV scale, 100-1000x lower than currently available. Quantum parity detectors (QPDs) are a novel class of proposed quantum devices that use the tremendous sensitivity of superconducting qubits to quasiparticle tunneling events as their detection concept. As envisioned, phonons generated by particle interactions within a crystalline substrate cause an eventual quasiparticle cascade within a surface patterned superconducting qubit element. This process alters the fundamental charge parity of the device in a binary manner, which can be used to deduce the initial properties of the energy deposition. We lay out the operating mechanism, noise sources, and expected sensitivity of QPDs based on a spectrum of charge-qubit types and readout mechanisms and detail an R&D pathway to demonstrating sensitivity to sub-eV energy deposits.

2024-05-27, **Apparent fake neutrino mixture due to seesaw mechanism responsible for oscillation**, Xiao-Yan Wang et.al., [2405.17105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17105v1)

 This paper assumes that neutrino flavor conversion is induced by right-handed neutrino mixture via seesaw mechanism, which leads to apparent fake neutrino mixture with neutrino mass eigenstate consistent with flavor state of left-handed neutrino rather than mixture of flavor state. The transition probability between right-handed neutrinos due to mixture can be explained well by boson intermediating flavor flip interaction between right-handed neutrinos and neutrino oscillation can be considered macro phenomenon before all flavor flip interactions arrive at balance.

2024-05-27, **Complementary Search of Fermionic Absorption Operators at Hadron Collider and Direct Detection Experiments**, Kai Ma et.al., [2405.16878v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16878v1)

 Instead of the energy recoil signal at direct detection experiments, dark matter appears always as missing energy at high energy colliders. For a fermionc dark matter coupled with quarks and neutrino via absorption operators, its production is always accompanied by an invisible neutrino. We study in details the mono-X (photon, jet, and $Z$) productions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). To make easy comparison between the collider and DM direct detection experiments, we start from the quark-level absorption operators for the first time. In other words, we study the model-independent constraints on a generic fermionic absorption dark fermion. In addition, the interplay and comparison with the possible detection at the neutrino experiment especially Borexino is also briefly discussed. We find that for both spin-dependent and spin-independent absorption of the dark matter, the experiments with light nuclear target can provide the strongest constraints.

2024-05-27, **The neutrino force in neutrino backgrounds: Spin dependence and parity-violating effects**, Mitrajyoti Ghosh et.al., [2405.16801v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16801v1)

 The neutrino force results from the exchange of a pair of neutrinos. A neutrino background can significantly influence this force. In this work, we present a comprehensive calculation of the neutrino force in various neutrino backgrounds with spin dependence taken into account. In particular, we calculate the spin-independent and spin-dependent parity-conserving neutrino forces, in addition to the spin-dependent parity-violating neutrino forces with and without the presence of a neutrino background for both isotropic and anisotropic backgrounds. Compared with the vacuum case, the neutrino background can effectively violate Lorentz invariance and lead to additional parity-violating terms that are not suppressed by the velocity of external particles. We estimate the magnitude of the effect of atomic parity-violation experiments, and it turns out to be well below the current experimental sensitivity.

2024-05-28, **Revisiting the decoupling limit of the Georgi-Machacek model with a scalar singlet**, Geneviève Bélanger et.al., [2405.18332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18332v1)

 We study the connection between collider and dark matter phenomenology in the singlet extension of the Georgi-Machacek model. In this framework, the singlet scalar serves as a suitable thermal dark matter (DM) candidate. Our focus lies on the region $v\_{\chi}<1$ GeV, where $v\_{\chi}$ is the common vacuum expectation value of the neutral components of the scalar triplets of the model. Setting bounds on the model parameters from theoretical, electroweak precision and LHC experimental constraints, we find that the BSM Higgs sector is highly constrained. Allowed values for the masses of the custodial fiveplets, triplets and singlet are restricted to the range $140~ {\rm GeV }< M\_{H\_5} < 350~ {\rm GeV }$, $150~ {\rm GeV }< M\_{H\_3} < 270 ~{\rm GeV }$ and $145~ {\rm GeV }< M\_{H} < 300~ {\rm GeV }$. The extended scalar sector provides new channels for DM annihilation into BSM scalars that allow to satisfy the observed relic density constraint while being consistent with direct DM detection limits. The allowed region of the parameter space of the model can be explored in the upcoming DM detection experiments, both direct and indirect. In particular, the possible high values of BR$(H^0\_5\to\gamma\gamma)$ can lead to an indirect DM signal within the reach of CTA. The same feature also provides the possibility of exploring the model at the High-Luminosity run of the LHC. In a simple cut-based analysis, we find that a signal of about $4\sigma$ significance can be achieved in final states with at least two photons for one of our benchmark points.

2024-05-28, **Population III star formation in the presence of turbulence, magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback**, Piyush Sharda et.al., [2405.18265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18265v1)

 Turbulence, magnetic fields and radiation feedback are key components that shape the formation of stars, especially in the metal-free environments at high redshifts where Population III stars form. Yet no 3D numerical simulations exist that simultaneously take all of these into account. We present the first suite of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code FLASH. We include both turbulent magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback coupled to primordial chemistry, and resolve the collapse of primordial clouds down to few au. We find that dynamically strong magnetic fields significantly slow down accretion onto protostars, while ionizing feedback is largely unable to regulate gas accretion because the partially ionized \ion{H}{ii} region gets trapped near the star due to insufficient radiative outputs from the star. The maximum stellar mass in the HD and RHD simulations that only yield one star exceeds $100\,\rm{M\_{\odot}}$ within the first $5000\,\rm{yr}$. However, in the corresponding MHD and RMHD runs, the maximum mass of Population III star is only $60\,\rm{M\_{\odot}}$. In other realizations where we observe widespread fragmentation leading to the formation of Population III star clusters, the maximum stellar mass is further reduced by a factor of few due to fragmentation-induced starvation. We thus conclude that magnetic fields are more important than ionizing feedback in regulating the mass of the star, at least during the earliest stages of Population III star formation, in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \approx 30$.

2024-05-28, **Theoretical bounds on dark Higgs mass in a self-interacting dark matter model with $U(1)'$**, Song Li et.al., [2405.18226v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18226v1)

 Motivated by the null results of current dark matter searches and the small-scale problems, we study a dark sector charged by a spontaneous broken gauge $U(1)'$. To explore the parameter space of this model, in addition to the consideration of the small-scale data, we also consider the theoretical bounds on the dark Higgs mass, with the upper bound coming from the tree-level perturbative unitarity and the lower bound from the one-loop Linde-Weinberg bound. We deeply examine the dependence of the Linde-Weinberg bound on gauge choice and energy scale. Combining the theoretical and observational constraints, we obtain the following ranges for the parameter space: the dark matter mass is 10-500 GeV, the mediator (dark photon) mass is 0.5-5 MeV, the dark Higgs mass is 0.05-50 MeV, the dark fine-structure constant is 0.001-0.5. We conclude that the dark Higgs in this model cannot be ignored in the phenomenological study of the dark sector.

2024-05-28, **The Separate Universe approach for multifield inflation models**, Hugo Holland et.al., [2405.18129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18129v1)

 Primordial black holes could constitute part or all of dark matter but they require large inhomogeneities to form in the early universe. These inhomogeneities can strongly backreact on the large scale dynamics of the universe. Stochastic inflation provides a way of studying this backreaction and getting an estimation of the abundance of primordial black holes. Because stochastic inflation focuses on large scale dynamics, it rests on the separate universe approach. However, the validity of this approach has only been checked in single field models, but not in multifield models in which we expect strong boosts in the power spectrum, leading to the formation of primordial black holes. We will check the validity of a separate universe approach in multifield models by matching it with a complete cosmological perturbation theory approach at large scales. In particular, we wish to compare these two paradigms and their differences in the adiabatic and entropic directions of the phase space. This will give us a range of validity and conditions one needs to verify in order to apply the separate universe approach and stochastic inflation in multifield models.

2024-05-28, **Euclid preparation. Observational expectations for redshift z<7 active galactic nuclei in the Euclid Wide and Deep surveys**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2405.18126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18126v1)

 We forecast the expected population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) observable in the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) and Euclid Deep Survey (EDS). Starting from an X-ray luminosity function (XLF) we generate volume-limited samples of the AGN expected in the survey footprints. Each AGN is assigned an SED appropriate for its X-ray luminosity and redshift, with perturbations sampled from empirical distributions. The photometric detectability of each AGN is assessed via mock observation of the assigned SED. We estimate 40 million AGN will be detectable in at least one band in the EWS and 0.24 million in the EDS, corresponding to surface densities of 2.8$\times$10$^{3}$ deg$^{-2}$ and 4.7$\times$10$^{3}$ deg$^{-2}$. Employing colour selection criteria on our simulated data we select a sample of 4.8$\times$10$^{6}$ (331 deg$^{-2}$) AGN in the EWS and 1.7$\times$10$^{4}$ (346 deg$^{-2}$) in the EDS, amounting to 10% and 8% of the AGN detectable in the EWS and EDS. Including ancillary Rubin/LSST bands improves the completeness and purity of AGN selection. These data roughly double the total number of selected AGN to comprise 21% and 15% of the detectable AGN in the EWS and EDS. The total expected sample of colour-selected AGN contains 6.0$\times$10$^{6}$ (74%) unobscured AGN and 2.1$\times$10$^{6}$ (26%) obscured AGN, covering $0.02 \leq z \lesssim 5.2$ and $43 \leq \log\_{10} (L\_{bol} / erg s^{-1}) \leq 47$. With this simple colour selection, expected surface densities are already comparable to the yield of modern X-ray and mid-infrared surveys of similar area. The relative uncertainty on our expectation for detectable AGN is 6.7% for the EWS and 12.5% for the EDS, driven by the uncertainty of the XLF.

2024-05-28, **Constraining vector dark matter and dark photon with degenerate mass in a hidden local SU(2) model**, Takaaki Nomura et.al., [2405.17885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17885v1)

 We discuss degenerate vector dark matter and dark photon that are induced from hidden $SU(2)\_H$ gauge sector where it is spontaneously broken by vacuum expectation value of $SU(2)\_H$ doublet. Kinetic mixing between $SU(2)\_H$ and $U(1)\_Y$ gauge fields can be generated by introducing dimension six operator realizing dark photon interactions. In estimating relic density we focus on the process in which dark matter annihilates into dark photons, and search for the region of dark matter mass and gauge coupling realizing observed relic density. We then discuss constraints from dark photon physics, thermalization of dark sector and direct detection of dark matter. It is then found that constraints from direct detection experiments give us the strongest upper limits on the dark photon interactions.

2024-05-28, **Shedding Light on Dark Sectors with Gravitational Waves**, Nelleke Bunji et.al., [2405.17851v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17851v1)

 The nature of dark matter remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in elementary particle physics. It might well be that the dark matter particle belongs to a dark sector completely secluded or extremely weakly coupled to the visible sector. We demonstrate that gravitational waves arising from first order phase transitions in the early Universe can be used to look for signatures of such dark sector models connected to neutron physics. This introduces a new connection between gravitational wave physics and nuclear physics experiments. Focusing on two particular extensions of the Standard Model with dark U(1) and SU(2) gauge groups constructed to address the neutron lifetime puzzle, we show how those signatures can be searched for in future gravitational wave and astrometry experiments.

2024-05-28, **Constructing a Galaxy Cluster Catalog in IllustrisTNG-300 using the Mulguisin Algorithm**, Lael Shin et.al., [2405.17738v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17738v1)

 We present a new simulated galaxy cluster catalog based on the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use the Mulguisin (MGS) algorithm to identify galaxy overdensities. Our cluster identification differs from the previous FoF cluster identification in two aspects; 1) we identify cluster halos based on the galaxy subhalos instead of unobservable dark matter particles, and 2) we use the MGS algorithm that separates galaxy overdensities hosted by massive galaxies. Our approach provides a cluster catalog constructed similar to the observed cluster catalogs using spectroscopic surveys. The MGS cluster catalog lists 303 halos with M$\_{200} > 10^{14}$ M$\_{\odot}$, including $\sim 10\%$ more than the FoF. The MGS catalog includes more systems because we separate some independent massive MGS cluster halos that are bundled into a single FoF algorithm. These independent MGS halos are apparently distinguishable in galaxy spatial distribution and the phase-space diagram. Because we constructed a refined cluster catalog that identifies local galaxy overdensities, we evaluate the effect of MGS clusters on the evolution of galaxies better than using the FoF cluster catalog. The MGS halo identification also enables effective identifications of merging clusters by selecting systems with neighboring galaxy overdensities. We thus highlight that the MGS cluster catalog is a useful tool for studying clusters in cosmological simulations and for comparing with the observed cluster samples.

2024-05-27, **Gravitationally produced Dark Matter and primordial black holes**, Enrico Bertuzzo et.al., [2405.17611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17611v1)

 We examine how the existence of a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) influences cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) for spin-0 and spin-1 particles. In addition to the known effects of particle production and entropy dilution resulting from PBH evaporation, we find that the generation of dark matter (DM) through CGPP is profoundly influenced by a possible era of PBH matter domination. This early matter dominated era results in an enhancement of the particle spectrum from CGPP. Specifically, it amplifies the peak comoving momentum $k\_\star$ for spin-1 DM, while enhancing the plateau of the spectrum for minimally coupled spin-0 particles for low comoving momenta. At the same time, the large entropy dilution may partially or completely compensate for the increase of the spectrum and strongly mitigates the DM abundance produced by CGPP. Our results show that, in the computation of the final abundance, CGPP and PBH evaporation cannot be disentangled, but the parameters of both sectors must be considered together to obtain the final result. Furthermore, we explore the potential formation of PBHs from density fluctuations arising from CGPP and the associated challenges in such a scenario.

 Different models of dark matter can alter the distribution of mass in galaxy clusters in a variety of ways. However, so can uncertain astrophysical feedback mechanisms. Here we present a Machine Learning method that ''learns'' how the impact of dark matter self-interactions differs from that of astrophysical feedback in order to break this degeneracy and make inferences on dark matter. We train a Convolutional Neural Network on images of galaxy clusters from hydro-dynamic simulations. In the idealised case our algorithm is 80% accurate at identifying if a galaxy cluster harbours collisionless dark matter, dark matter with ${\sigma}\_{\rm DM}/m = 0.1$cm$^2/$g or with ${\sigma}\_{DM}/m = 1$cm$^2$/g. Whilst we find adding X-ray emissivity maps does not improve the performance in differentiating collisional dark matter, it does improve the ability to disentangle different models of astrophysical feedback. We include noise to resemble data expected from Euclid and Chandra and find our model has a statistical error of < 0.01cm$^2$/g and that our algorithm is insensitive to shape measurement bias and photometric redshift errors. This method represents a new way to analyse data from upcoming telescopes that is an order of magnitude more precise and many orders faster, enabling us to explore the dark matter parameter space like never before.

2024-05-27, **Rescuing thermally under-abundant dark matter with a first-order phase transition**, Amit Adhikary et.al., [2405.17564v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17564v1)

 We propose a novel scenario where thermally under-abundant dark matter (DM) can be revived with a first-order phase transition (FOPT). In the absence of FOPT, thermal DM abundance remains suppressed due to efficient annihilation via mediators. A FOPT brings sharp change to the mass of the mediator at the nucleation temperature such that the final DM relic agrees with observations. We implement this idea in a scenario where DM interacts via a mediator whose initial mass is of same order as DM mass keeping DM annihilation either in allowed or forbidden ballpark. As the mediator mass decreases sharply at the nucleation temperature of the FOPT, the frozen out DM suffers further depletion while keeping final relic within observed limits. DM with sizeable interactions with a light mediator can also give rise to the required self-interactions necessary to solve the small scale structure issues of cold dark matter. While the mechanism is generic to any thermal DM mass, choosing it in the GeV ballpark forces the FOPT to MeV scale which predicts stochastic gravitational waves with nano-Hz frequencies within reach of pulsar timing array (PTA) based experiments like NANOGrav. The existence of light scalar mediator and its mixing with the Higgs keep the scenario verifiable at different particle physics experiments.

2024-05-27, **Stepping into the Forest: Confronting Interacting Radiation Models for the Hubble Tension with Lyman-$α$ Data**, Hengameh Bagherian et.al., [2405.17554v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17554v1)

 Models of interacting dark radiation have been shown to alleviate the Hubble tension. Extensions incorporating a coupling between dark matter and dark radiation (DM-DR) have been proposed as combined solutions to both the Hubble and $S\_8$ tensions. A key feature of these extended models is a break in the matter power spectrum (MPS), suppressing power for modes that enter the horizon before the DM-DR interactions turn off. In scenarios with a massless mediator, modes that enter before matter-radiation equality get suppressed, whereas for massive mediators, the break is determined by the mediator mass, a free parameter. In this work, we test these models against probes of LSS: weak lensing, CMB lensing, full-shape galaxy clustering, and eBOSS measurements of the 1D Ly$\alpha\,$ forest flux power spectrum. The latter are the most constraining since they probe small scales where many models predict the largest deviations. In fact, already within $\Lambda{\rm CDM}\,$, the eBOSS Ly$\alpha\,$ data are in significant tension with Planck CMB data, with the Ly$\alpha\,$ data preferring a steeper slope of the MPS at $k \sim h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We find that the simplest dark radiation models, which improve the Hubble tension, worsen the fit to the Ly$\alpha\,$ data. However, models with DM-DR interactions can simultaneously address both tensions.

 Sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles produced via thermal freeze-out evade many of the strong constraints on heavier DM candidates but at the same time face a multitude of new constraints from laboratory experiments, astrophysical observations and cosmological data. In this work we combine all of these constraints in order to perform frequentist and Bayesian global analyses of fermionic and scalar sub-GeV DM coupled to a dark photon with kinetic mixing. For fermionic DM, we find viable parameter regions close to the dark photon resonance, which expand significantly when including a particle-antiparticle asymmetry. For scalar DM, the velocity-dependent annihilation cross section evades the strongest constraints even in the symmetric case. Using Bayesian model comparison, we show that both asymmetric fermionic DM and symmetric scalar DM are preferred over symmetric fermionic DM due to the reduced fine-tuning penalty. Finally, we explore the discovery prospects of near-future experiments both in the full parameter space and for specific benchmark points. We find that the most commonly used benchmark scenarios are already in tension with existing constraints and propose a new benchmark point that can be targeted with future searches.

2024-05-27, **EPOCHS Paper X: Environmental effects on Galaxy Formation and Protocluster Galaxy candidates at $4.5<z<10$ from JWST observations**, Qiong Li et.al., [2405.17359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17359v1)

 In this paper we describe our search for galaxy protocluster candidates at $4.5< z < 10$ and explore the environmental and physical properties of their member galaxies identified through JWST wide-field surveys within the CEERS, JADES, and PEARLS NEP-TDF fields. Combining with HST data, we identify 2948 robust $z>4.5$ candidates within an area of 185.4 arcmin$^2$. We determine nearest neighbour statistics and galaxy environments. We find that high-$z$ galaxies in overdense environments exhibit higher star formation activity compared to those in underdense regions. Galaxies in dense environments have a slightly increased SFR at a given mass compared with galaxies in the lower density environments. At the high mass end we also find a gradual flattening of the $M\_{\star}$-SFR slope. We find that galaxies in high-density regions often have redder UV slopes than those in low-density regions, suggesting more dust extinction, weaker Lyman-alpha emission and / or a higher damped Lyman-alpha absorption. We also find that the mass-size relation remains consistent and statistically similar across all environments. Furthermore, we quantitatively assess the probability of a galaxy belonging to a protocluster candidate. In total, we identified 26 overdensities at $z=5-7$ and estimate their dark matter halo masses. We find that all protocluster candidates could evolve into clusters with $M\_{\rm halo} > 10^{14}M\_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$, thereby supporting the theoretical and simulation predictions of cluster formation. Notably, this marks an early search for protocluster candidates in JWST wide field based on photometric data, providing valuable candidates to study cosmic structure formation at the early stages.

 Barred galaxies constitute about two thirds of observed disc galaxies. Bars affect not only the mass distribution of gas and stars, but also that of the dark matter. An elongation of the inner dark matter halo is known as the halo bar. We aim to characterise the structure of the halo bars, with the goal of correlating them with the properties of the stellar bars. We use a suite of simulated galaxies with various bar strengths, including gas and star formation. We quantify strengths, shapes, and densities of these simulated stellar bars. We carry out numerical experiments with frozen and analytic potentials in order to understand the role played by a live responsive stellar bar. We find that the halo bar generally follows the trends of the disc bar. The strengths of the halo and stellar bars are tightly correlated. Stronger bars induce a slight increase of dark matter density within the inner halo. Numerical experiments show that a non-responsive frozen stellar bar would be capable of inducing a dark matter bar, but it would be weaker than the live case by a factor of roughly two.

 We establish the possibility of having a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) Dark Matter (DM) candidate in the Froggatt-Nielsen Singlet Model (FNSM) wherein a direct connection exists between the DM mass and flavon symmetry-breaking scale. We find a considerable allowed region of parameter space for the ensuing pseudoscalar DM, which is dependent upon the flavon Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) and Yukawa couplings, over which it may be possible to explain the fermion mass hierarchy. Finally, we choose a Benchmark Point (BP) and perform detailed collider analyses to probe this DM state in the context of Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Specifically, in this model, one obtains large missing transverse energy ($\slashed{E}\_T$) when the DM particle is resonantly produced from the decay of a heavy Higgs field, along with multiple jets from Initial State Radiation (ISR). Thus, the ensuing $\slashed{E}\_T$ + $n\, {\rm jets}~(n \geq 1)$ signature is an excellent probe of DM in this construct.

2024-05-28, **A path towards constraining the evolution of the interstellar medium and outflows in the Milky Way using APOGEE**, Piyush Sharda et.al., [2405.18223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18223v1)

 In recent years, the study of the Milky Way has significantly advanced due to extensive spectroscopic surveys of its stars, complemented by astroseismic and astrometric data. However, it remains disjoint from recent advancements in understanding the physics of the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). This paper introduces a new model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way that can be constrained on stellar data, because it combines a state-of-the-art ISM model with a Milky Way stellar disc model. Utilizing a dataset of red clump stars from APOGEE, known for their precise ages and metallicities, we concentrate on the last 6 billion years -- a period marked by Milky Way's secular evolution. We examine the oxygen abundance in the low-$\alpha$ disc stars relative to their ages and birth radii, validating or constraining critical ISM parameters that remain largely unexplored in extragalactic observations. The models that successfully reproduce the radius -- metallicity distribution and the age -- metallicity distribution of stars without violating existing ISM observations indicate a need for modest differential oxygen enrichment in Galactic outflows, meaning that the oxygen abundance of outflows is higher than the local ISM abundance, irrespective of outflow mass loading. The models also suggest somewhat elevated ISM gas velocity dispersion levels over the past 6 billion years compared to galaxies of similar mass. The extra turbulence necessary could result from energy from gas accretion onto the Galaxy, supernovae clustering in the ISM, or increased star formation efficiency per freefall time. This work provides a novel approach to constraining the Galactic ISM and outflows, leveraging the detailed insights available from contemporary Milky Way surveys.

2024-05-28, **The expected evolution of the binary system PTF J2238+743015.1**, Luciano Piersanti et.al., [2405.17896v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17896v1)

 Binary systems made by a low-mass CO WD and a He-donor represent possible progenitors of explosive events via He-detonation, producing low-luminosity thermonuclear Supernovae with a peculiar nucleosynthetis. Recently, the binary system PTF J223857.11+743015.1 has been suggested as one. We investigate the evolution of the PTF J223857.11+743015.1 system, composed by a 0.75Msun CO WD and a 0.390Msun subdwarf, capped by a thin H-rich layer, considering rotation of the WD component. We compute the evolution of two stars simultaneously, accounting for the possible evolution of the orbital parameters, as determined by mass transfer between components and by mass ejection from the system during RLOF episodes. We consider that the WD gains angular momentum due to accretion and we follow the evolution of the angular velocity profile as due to angular momentum transport via convection and rotation-induced instabilities. As the donor H-rich envelope is transferred, the WD experiences recurrent very strong H-flashes triggering RLOF episodes during which the entire accreted matter is lost from the system. Due to mixing of chemicals by rotation-induced instabilities during the accretion phase, H-flashes occur inside the original WD. Hence, pulse-by pulse, the accretor mass is reduced down to 0.7453Msun. When He-rich matter is transferred, He-detonation does not occur in the rotating WD, which undergoes 6 very strong He-flashes and subsequent RLOF episodes. Also in this case, due to rotation-induced mixing of the accreted layers with the underlying core, the WD is eroded. Finally, when the mass transfer rate from the donor decreases, a massive He-buffer is piled-up onto the accretor which ends its life as a cooling WD. The binary system PTF J2238+743015.1 as all those binaries having similar components masses and orbital parameters are not good candidates as thermonuclear explosions progenitors.

2024-05-27, **A model-independent treatment of cosmic ladder calibration and $Ω_k$ measurement through low-$z$ observations**, Arianna Favale et.al., [2405.17643v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17643v1)

 Looking at the well-known Hubble tension as a tension in the calibrators of the cosmic distance ladder, i.e. the absolute magnitude $M$ of standard candles such as supernovae of Type Ia (SNIa) and the standard ruler represented by the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, $r\_d$, we propose a model-independent method to measure these distance calibrators independently from the cosmic microwave background and the first rungs of the direct distance ladder. To do so, we leverage state-of-the-art data on cosmic chronometers (CCH), SNIa and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from various galaxy surveys. Taking advantage of the Gaussian Processes Bayesian technique, we reconstruct $M(z)$, $\Omega\_k(z)$ and $r\_d(z)$ at $z\lesssim2$ and check that no significant statistical evolution is preferred at 68\% C.L. This allows us to treat them as constants and constrain them assuming the metric description of gravity, the cosmological principle and the validity of CCH as reliable cosmic clocks, and SNIa and BAO as optimal standard candles and standard rulers, respectively, but otherwise in a model-independent way. We obtain: $\Omega\_k=-0.07^{+0.12}\_{-0.15}$, $M=(-19.314^{+0.086}\_{-0.108})$ mag and $r\_d=(142.3\pm 5.3)$ Mpc. At present, the uncertainties derived are still too large to arbitrate the tension but this is bound to change in the near future with the advent of upcoming surveys and data.

2024-05-27, **Reverse Shock Revisited in Cassiopeia A with Chandra**, Yin Wu et.al., [2405.17524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17524v1)

 Using data from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, we revisited the reverse shock in the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A.Based on the spectroscopic of a series of annuli in the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE), we get the radial profiles of the S/Si K-alpha line flux ratio and Fe K-alpha line centroid energy. They both show monotonic increase, confirming that the Si- and Fe-rich ejecta are heated by the reverse shock.The abrupt change of the S and Si line flux ratio is clearly observed in Cassiopeia A, leading to the determination of the reverse shock location (~1.71+-0.16 arcmin and ~1.35+-0.18 arcmin in the NW and SE, with respect to the central source). By comparing the radial profiles of S and Si line flux, we find that the reverse shock is moving outward in the frame of the observer, and the velocities are ~3950+-210 km/s and ~2900+-260 km/s in the NW and SE, respectively. In contrast, the velocities become ~1150 km/s (NW) and ~1300 km/s (SE) in the ejecta frame. Our measured reverse shock velocities are quite consistent with those obtained from the X-ray and/or optical images. It therefore supplies a crosscheck of the accuracy for the two available methods to measure the reverse shock velocity in SNRs. Both the location and the velocity of the reverse shock show apparent asymmetry, suggesting that the asymmetric explosion of the progenitor plays a key role in the interaction between the reverse shock and the ejecta, ultimately shaping complex features observed in SNRs.

 Dynamical dark energy has gained renewed interest due to recent theoretical and observational developments. In the present paper, we focus on a string-motivated dark energy set-up, and perform a detailed cosmological analysis of exponential quintessence with potential $V=V\_0 e^{-\lambda\phi}$, allowing for non-zero spatial curvature. We first gain some physical intuition into the full evolution of such a scenario by analysing the corresponding dynamical system. Then, we test the model using a combination of Planck CMB data, DESI BAO data, as well as recent supernovae datasets. For the model parameter $\lambda$, we obtain a preference for nonzero values: $\lambda = 0.48^{+0.28}\_{-0.21},\; 0.68^{+0.31}\_{-0.20},\; 0.77^{+0.18}\_{-0.15}$ at 68% C.L. when combining CMB+DESI with Pantheon+, Union3 and DES-Y5 supernovae datasets respectively. We find no significant hint for spatial curvature. We discuss the implications of current cosmological results for the exponential quintessence model, and more generally for dark energy in string theory.

2024-05-27, **Supernova Remnants in Gamma Rays**, Andrea Giuliani et.al., [2405.17384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17384v1)

 In the 1960s, the remnants of supernova explosions (SNRs) were indicated as a possible source of galactic cosmic rays through the Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) mechanism. Since then, the observation of gamma-ray emission from relativistic ions in these objects has been one of the main goals of high-energy astrophysics. A few dozen SNRs have been detected at GeV and TeV photon energies in the last two decades. However, these observations have shown a complex phenomenology that is not easy to reduce to the standard paradigm based on DSA acceleration. Although the understanding of these objects has greatly increased, and their nature as efficient electron and proton accelerators has been observed, it remains to be clarified whether these objects are the main contributors to galactic cosmic rays. Here, we review the observations of {\gamma}-ray emission from SNRs and the perspectives for the future.

2024-05-27, **Standardizing the Gamma-ray burst as a standard candle and applying to the cosmological probes: constraints on the two-component dark energy model**, Jia-Lun Li et.al., [2405.17010v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17010v1)

 As one of the most energetic and brightest events, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been used as a standard candle for cosmological probe. Based on the relevant features of GRBs light curves, a plateau phase followed a decay phase, we obtain X-ray samples of 31 GRBs and optical samples of 50 GRBs, which are thought to be caused by the same physical mechanism. We standardize GRBs using the two-dimension fundamental plane relation of the rest-frame luminosity of the plateau emission ($L\_{b,z}$) and the end time of plateau ($T\_{b,z}$) $L\_{b,z}-T\_{b,z}$, as well as the three-dimension fundamental plane correlation including the peak energy ($E\_{p,i}$) $L\_{b,z}-T\_{b,z}-E\_{p,i}$. For the cosmological probes, we consider the $\omega$CDM model in which the dark energy consists of one component, and mainly focus on the $X\_1X\_2$CDM model in which the dark energy is made up of two independent components. We obtain the constraints on the related parameters of the cosmological models using the type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data and selected X-ray and optical samples. For the $X\_1X\_2$CDM model, we find that the values of the equations of state parameters of two dark energies, $\omega\_1$ and $\omega\_2$, are very close. We also conduct the comparison between the models using the Bayesian information criterion, and find that the $\omega$CDM model is favoured.
