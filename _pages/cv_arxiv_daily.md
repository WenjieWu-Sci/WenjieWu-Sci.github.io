2024-08-28, **Non-holomorphic Modular $S_4$ Lepton Flavour Models**, Gui-Jun Ding et.al., [2408.15988v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15988v1)

 In the formalism of the non-supersymmetric modular invariance approach to the flavour problem the elements of the Yukawa coupling and fermion mass matrices are expressed in terms of polyharmonic Maa{\ss} modular forms of level $N$ in addition to the standard modula forms of the same level and a small number of constant parameters. Non-trivial polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms exist for zero, negative and positive integer modular weights. Employing the finite modula group $S\_4$ as a flavour symmetry group and assuming that the three left-handed lepton doublets furnish a triplet irreducible representation of $S\_4$, we construct all possible 7- and 8-parameter lepton flavour models in which the neutrino masses are generated either by the Weinberg effective operator or by the type I seesaw mechanism. We identify the phenomenologically viable models and obtain predictions for each of these models for the neutrino mass ordering, the absolute neutrino mass scale, the Dirac and Majorana CP-violation phases and, correspondingly, for the sum of neutrino masses and the neutrinoless double beta decay effective Majorana mass. We comment on how these models can be tested and conclude that they are all falsifiable. Detailed analyses are presented in the case of three representative benchmark lepton flavour scenarios.

2024-08-28, **Reconstruction of highly inclined extensive air showers in GRAND**, Oscar Macias et.al., [2408.15952v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15952v1)

 The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect highly inclined extensive air showers (EAS) with down-going and up-going trajectories. Several working groups in the GRAND collaboration are developing methods to reconstruct the incoming direction, core position, primary energy, and composition of the showers. The reconstruction pipeline -- currently under development in the France/IAP working group -- relies on a model of spherical wavefront emission for arrival times, which is possible because the radio signals are generated far away from the antenna stations. The amplitude distribution of the signals at the antenna level is described by an Angular Distribution Function that considers various asymmetries in the data, including geomagnetic effects. In this contribution, we present preliminary results from testing our EAS reconstruction procedure using realistic mock observations.

2024-08-28, **Probing Lorentz invariance with a high-energy neutrino flare**, Mauricio Bustamante et.al., [2408.15949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15949v1)

 Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the 2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or 10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.

2024-08-28, **Hybrid Type-II and Type-III seesaw model for the muon $g-2$ anomaly**, Lei Cai et.al., [2408.15910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15910v1)

 In this work, we investigate the muon anomalous dipole moment $a\_\mu$ in a model that extends the Standard Model with a scalar triplet and a vector-like lepton triplet. Different from previous studies, we find that there is still viable parameter space in this model to explain the discrepancy $\Delta a\_\mu=a\_{\mu}(\mathrm{Exp})-a\_{\mu}(\mathrm{SM})$. While being consistent with the current data of neutrino mass, precision electroweak measurements and the perturbativity of couplings, our model can provide new physics contribution $a\_\mu^\textrm{NP}$ to cover the central region of $\Delta a\_\mu$ with new scalar and fermion mass as low as around TeV. This mass scale is allowed by the current collider searches for doubly charged scalars and vector-like leptons, and they can be tested at future high energy and/or high luminosity colliders.

2024-08-28, **A roadmap for neutrino detection at LHC, HL-LHC and SPS**, Elena Graverini et.al., [2408.15851v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15851v1)

 SND@LHC is a new detector for neutrino physics at LHC. Its experimental configuration makes it possible to distinguish between all three neutrino flavours, opening a unique opportunity to probe physics of heavy flavour production at the LHC in the region that is not accessible to ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. It can also explore lepton flavour universality in the neutral sector, and search for feebly interacting particles. The detector has been commissioned and installed in 2021-2022. A first set of data has since then been collected, providing the first observation of neutrinos produced at a collider. This paper discusses the detector technologies being used to study high-energy neutrinos at the LHC, and their performance in terms of physics reach. The necessary upgrades to operate at high-luminosity LHC are presented, as well as a proposed experiment to perform neutrino measurements at the newly approved Beam Dump Facility.

2024-08-28, **Study of CP Violation in charm decays**, Felipe Cesário Laterza Lopes et.al., [2408.15525v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15525v1)

 The violation of the Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry is a phenomenon described by the Standard Model (SM), however, its predictions for this violation are not enough to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the visible universe. Experimentally, CP violation in hadronic decays had already been observed in various circumstances before 2019, when the LHCb experiment at CERN first published results reporting CPV in D-meson decays [arXiv:1903.08726v2] ($D^0 \to K^- K^+$ and $D^0 \to \pi^- \pi^+$). In this work, a study of CP violation is carried out analysing the phenomenology of charm decays. The study of such topic is guided by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix and the process of flavour changing decays caused by the weak interaction (focusing on charm decays). The symmetries attributed to physical conservation laws were recognized, allowing for the possibilities of CP violation predicted by the SM to be examined more closely. Such theoretical studies are then compared to the results obtained by the LHCb Collaboration. Furthermore, a comparison between CPV in charm decays and in neutrino oscillations is made, analysing the CP violating phase in both the CKM and the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrices.

2024-08-28, **Phenomenological study of heavy neutral gauge boson in the left-right symmetric model at future muon collider**, Zongyang Lu et.al., [2408.15471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15471v1)

 The exotic neutral gauge boson is a powerful candidate for the new physics beyond the standard model. As a promising model, the left-right symmetric model has been proposed to explain the neutrino mass, dark matter, and matter-antimatter asymmetry, etc., in which exotic gauge bosons $Z^\prime, W^{\prime \pm}$ have been put forward as well as other new right-handed particles. We investigate the $\mu^+ \mu^- \to q\bar{q} $ and $ \mu^+ \mu^- \to l^+ l^- $ processes involving the $Z^\prime$ boson as an intermediate particle. The coupling strength, decay width and mass are the key parameters on the production and decay processes of the $Z^\prime$ boson. The results indicate that the angular distributions of final particles are sensitive to the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to the other fermions. Asymmetries defined from the angular distributions are ideal quantities to demonstrate the discrepancy between the standard model process and the processes with $Z^\prime$ participated and they are also appropriate observables to discriminate the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to other particles. Compared with the current results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the future muon collider has a great potential to explore the new parameter space with $Z^\prime$ boson.

2024-08-27, **Collapsar disk outflows II: Heavy element production**, Coleman Dean et.al., [2408.15338v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15338v1)

 We investigate nucleosynthesis in the sub-relativistic outflows from black hole (BH) accretion disks formed in failed supernovae from rapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet stars. These disks reach the neutrino-cooled regime during a portion of their evolution, undergoing significant neutronization and thus having the potential to support the $r$-process. Here, we analyze the formation of heavy elements in the ejecta from global, axisymmetric, long-term, viscous hydrodynamic simulations of these systems that include neutrino emission and absorption, Newtonian self-gravity, a pseudo-Newtonian potential for the BH gravity, and a 19-isotope nuclear network. Tracer particles are used for post-processing with a larger network. In addition to analyzing models from a previous paper, we present new models in which we modify the rotation profile of the progenitor star, to maximize neutrino reprocessing of circularized mass shells. All of our models produce several $M\_\odot$ of O, followed by about a solar mass of C, Ne, and Ni, with other alpha elements produced in smaller quantities. Only one of our models, with the lowest viscosity, yields significant amounts of first $r$-process peak elements, with negligible yields at higher nuclear masses. The rest of the set, including models with a modified rotation profile, produces very small or negligible quantities of elements beyond the iron group. Models that produce the heaviest elements (up to $A\sim200$) do so along the proton-rich side of the valley of stability at high entropy ($s/k\_B\sim80$), pointing to the $rp$-process as a mechanism that operates in collapsars. The absence of neutron-rich ejecta proves to be insensitive to changes in the rotation profile of the star, suggesting that heavy $r$-process elements are difficult to produce in collapsars if no large-scale poloidal magnetic field is present in the disk to drive outflows during neutronization.

2024-08-27, **De-excitations of highly excited $^{11}$B$^*$ and $^{15}$N$^*$ based on the GEMINI++ code**, Yujie Niu et.al., [2408.14955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14955v1)

 Nuclear de-excitations associated with neutrino-nucleus interactions and nucleon decays are playing an increasingly significant role in neutrino experiments. We explore the GEMINI++ code and estimate its ability to account for the de-excitation processes of highly excited $^{11}$B$^*$ and $^{15}$N$^*$, which can be created in the liquid scintillator and water Cherenkov detectors respectively. It is found that GEMINI++ can not describe the nuclear experimental data of $^{11}$B$^*$ and $^{15}$N$^*$ well. To improve its performance for de-excitations of light nuclei, we modify GEMINI++ and then develop a code of GEMINI++4$\nu$, which can give the best predictions compared with experimental measurements among some widely used statistical model codes.

2024-08-27, **Neutrino Masses and Mixing in an Axion Model**, Sin Kyu Kang et.al., [2408.14942v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14942v1)

 We propose a novel framework that addresses three critical issues: tiny neutrino masses and mixing, dark matter, and the strong CP problem. Our model extends the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry by incorporating modular $S\_3$ symmetry to specifically address neutrino mixing. It features two vector-like colored fermions and three colored scalars as $S\_3$ singlets, an isospin doublet inert scalar and a singlet PQ scalar with appropriate modular weights assigned. Tiny neutrino masses are generated radiatively through colored mediators, while the KSVZ-type axion appears to dynamically resolve the strong CP problem. We investigate the phenomenology of lepton flavor violation and the muon $g-2$ anomaly within this framework. Additionally, we explore the axion's properties and its role as dark matter.

2024-08-27, **Lepton flavour violation Signals of the singly charged scalar singlet at the ILC**, Chong-Xing Yue et.al., [2408.14856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14856v1)

 The singly charged $SU(2)\_L$ singlet scalar is one of the very interesting new particles, as it can generate neutrino masses at loop level, produce contributions to various flavour observables. We study the possibility of detecting this kind of scalar predicted by the singly-charged scalar model at ILC via the lepton flavour violation (LFV) process $e^+e^-\rightarrow S^+S^-\rightarrow \mu e + {E\mkern-10.5 mu/}$. Considering the constraints on the free parameters, we obtain the expected sensitivities of the ILC with the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=1~\mathrm{TeV}$ and the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=$ $1.5~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$ to the parameter space of the singly-charged scalar model. The prospective excluded mass range at $95\%$ C.L. is $M\_S \gtrsim 470~\mathrm{GeV}$, $410~\mathrm{GeV}$ for the branching ratio $\mathcal{B}\_{\mu e}$ = $100\%$ , $50\%$, respectively, while the scalar with $M\_S \gtrsim 300~\mathrm{GeV}$ is excluded at $95\%$ C.L. for $\mathcal{B}\_{\mu e}$ = $30\%$.

2024-08-28, **Stochastic Dark Matter from Curvature Perturbations**, Raghuveer Garani et.al., [2408.15987v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15987v1)

 We investigate the production of dark matter from curvature perturbations produced during inflation or in standard cosmology, for example during first order phase transitions. Perturbations break Weyl flatness of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, allowing conformally coupled fields -- in particular fermions studied here -- to be produced even in the massless limit. Particle production can be computed by studying the Bogoliubov transformation induced by the stochastic background. For perturbations generated during inflation, we present a closed formula for the resulting abundance of particles that depends solely on the power spectrum of curvature perturbations at the end of inflation. This production mechanism can be dominant especially if the amplitude of curvature perturbations is enhanced for modes that exit the horizon towards the end of inflation. In the simplest scenario, the critical dark matter abundance is reproduced for $M \gtrsim 10^{6}$ GeV.

2024-08-28, **Probing Dark Matter Electromagnetic Properties in Direct Detection Experiments**, Alejandro Ibarra et.al., [2408.15760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15760v1)

 Astronomical and cosmological observations indicate that dark matter should interact very weakly with the electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, the existence of such interactions is not precluded by observations nor by theoretical considerations. A promising approach to probe the dark matter electromagnetic properties is through the search of photon-mediated dark matter-nucleus interactions in direct detection experiments. In this paper we present a simple methodology to calculate the scattering rate in a direct detection experiment for given values of the dark matter electric charge, charge radius, electric- and magnetic- dipole moments and anapole moment. In our work we include contributions to the scattering from nuclear recoils and from the Migdal effect. We finally apply this formalism to determine exclusion limits on the five electromagnetic interactions using data from XENON1T, LZ, PICO-60 and DS50 experiments, and we discuss the implications for a simplified dark matter model with t-channel mediators.

2024-08-28, **Spin-dependent exotic interactions**, Lei Cong et.al., [2408.15691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15691v1)

 Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.

2024-08-28, **Self-Interacting Dark Matter and flavor anomalies in an atlas of leptophilic models**, Nicolás Gómez et.al., [2408.15536v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15536v1)

 We consider an atlas of leptophilic models with non-universal charges that combine the quantum numbers \((L\_e - L\_{\mu})\) and \((L\_{\mu} - L\_{\tau})\) in various realizations. We explore diverse manifestations of the atlas to understand their impact on explaining the muon \((g-2)\_{\mu}\) anomaly, as well as the origin of self-interacting dark matter, which serves as a feasible explanation for the small-scale challenges of cold dark matter. We found that a single vector gauge boson with mass range of $\sim 10~\mathrm{MeV}$ and non-universal couplings as indicated successfully mediates interactions in the fermion and dark matter sectors in such a way that $(g-2)\_{\mu}$ additional contribution agrees with experimental constraints and the self-interacting dark matter fluid behaves as suggested by observations at different astrophysical length scales. Furthermore, the model requires a dark matter candidate within $10-100~ \mathrm{GeV}$ order mass and a strong dark coupling ($g\_{\chi} \sim 0.3$, much stronger than the lepton's couplings $g'\_l \lesssim 10^{-4}$) to be a successful scenario to unravel astrophysical small scale problems.

2024-08-27, **Ultralight dark matter detection with levitated ferromagnets**, Saarik Kalia et.al., [2408.15330v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15330v1)

 Levitated ferromagnets act as ultraprecise magnetometers, which can exhibit high quality factors due to their excellent isolation from the environment. These instruments can be utilized in searches for ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axionlike dark matter or dark-photon dark matter. In addition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing, which produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the effective magnetic field (or ``axion wind") produced by an axion-electron coupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC magnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC fields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC magnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and dark-photon dark matter. We pay special attention to the direction of motion induced by an applied AC field, in particular, whether it precesses around the applied field (similar to an electron spin) or librates in the plane of the field (similar to a compass needle). We show that existing levitated ferromagnet setups can already have comparable sensitivity to an axion-electron coupling as comagnetometer or torsion balance experiments. In addition, future setups can become sensitive probes of axion-electron coupling, dark-photon kinetic mixing, and axion-photon coupling, for ultralight dark matter masses $m\_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{feV}$.

2024-08-27, **Search for Dark Matter Induced Airglow in Planetary Atmospheres**, Carlos Blanco et.al., [2408.15318v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15318v1)

 We point out that dark matter can illuminate planetary skies via ultraviolet airglow. Dark matter annihilation products can excite molecular hydrogen, which then deexcites to produce ultraviolet emission in the Lyman and Werner bands. We search for this new effect by analyzing nightside ultraviolet radiation data from Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and New Horizons flybys of Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter. Our findings set new constraints on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section down to about $10^{-40}~$cm$^2$. We highlight that future ultraviolet airglow measurements of Solar System planets or other worlds provide a new dark matter discovery avenue.

2024-08-27, **Aggressively-Dissipative Dark Dwarfs: The Effects of Atomic Dark Matter on the Inner Densities of Isolated Dwarf Galaxies**, Sandip Roy et.al., [2408.15317v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15317v1)

 We present the first suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies for a dark sector that consists of Cold Dark Matter and a strongly-dissipative sub-component. The simulations are implemented in GIZMO and include standard baryons following the FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics model. The dissipative dark matter is modeled as Atomic Dark Matter (aDM), which forms a dark hydrogen gas that cools in direct analogy to the Standard Model. Our suite includes seven different simulations of $\sim 10^{10} M\_{\odot}$ systems that vary over the aDM microphysics and the dwarf's evolutionary history. We identify a region of aDM parameter space where the cooling rate is aggressive and the resulting halo density profile is universal. In this regime, the aDM gas cools rapidly at high redshifts and only a small fraction survives in the form of a central dark gas disk; the majority collapses centrally into collisionless dark "clumps", which are clusters of sub-resolution dark compact objects. These dark clumps rapidly equilibrate in the inner galaxy, resulting in an approximately isothermal distribution that can be modeled with a simple fitting function. Even when only a small fraction ($\sim 5\%$) of the total dark matter is strongly dissipative, the central densities of classical dwarf galaxies can be enhanced by over an order of magnitude, providing a sharp prediction for observations.

2024-08-27, **Constraints on the parameter space in dark matter admixed neutron stars**, Ankit Kumar et.al., [2408.15312v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15312v1)

 We investigate the impact of dark matter on neutron star properties using the relativistic mean-field theory. By incorporating the dark matter model, we explore how dark matter parameters, specifically dark matter mass and Fermi momentum, influence nuclear saturation properties, the equation of state, and the mass-radius relationship of neutron stars. We also examine the universal relation between dimensionless tidal deformability and compactness in the presence of dark matter. Our results show that the inclusion of dark matter significantly alters nuclear saturation properties, leading to higher incompressibility and symmetry energy values. Notably, higher dark matter Fermi momenta and masses result in more compact neutron star configurations with reduced radii and lower maximum masses, highlighting a complex interplay between dark matter and nuclear matter. Deviations from the universal relation are observed with dark matter inclusion, particularly for neutron stars with lower compactness. By leveraging observational data from PSR J0740+6620, GW170817, and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) measurements of PSR J0030+0451, we derive stringent constraints on dark matter parameter space within neutron stars, emphasizing the necessity of integrating multimodal observations to delineate the properties of dark matter along with neutron stars. Our findings underscore the importance of considering dark matter effects in neutron star modeling and suggest potential refinements for current theoretical frameworks to accurately predict neutron star properties under various astrophysical conditions.

2024-08-27, **Axion Dark Matter eXperiment around 3.3 μeV with Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky Discovery Ability**, C. Bartram et.al., [2408.15227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15227v1)

 We report the results of a QCD axion dark matter search with discovery ability for Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) axions using an axion haloscope. Sub-Kelvin noise temperatures are reached with an ultra low-noise Josephson parametric amplifier cooled by a dilution refrigerator. This work excludes (with a 90% confidence level) DFSZ axions with masses between 3.27 to 3.34 {\mu}eV, assuming a standard halo model with a local energy density of 0.45 GeV/cc made up 100% of axions.

2024-08-27, **EDGE: Predictable Scatter in the Stellar Mass--Halo Mass Relation of Dwarf Galaxies**, Stacy Y. Kim et.al., [2408.15214v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15214v1)

 The stellar-mass--halo-mass (SMHM) relation is central to our understanding of galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. However, its normalisation, slope, and scatter are highly uncertain at dwarf galaxy scales. In this paper, we present DarkLight, a new semi-empirical dwarf galaxy formation model designed to robustly predict the SMHM relation for the smallest galaxies. DarkLight harnesses a correlation between the mean star formation rate of dwarfs and their peak rotation speed -- the $\langle$SFR$\rangle$-$v\_{\rm max}$ relation -- that we derive from simulations and observations. Given the sparsity of data for isolated dwarfs with $v\_{\rm max} \lesssim 20$ km/s, we fit the $\langle$SFR$\rangle$-$v\_{\rm max}$ relation to observational data for dwarfs above this velocity scale and to the high-resolution EDGE cosmological simulations below. Reionisation quenching is implemented via distinct $\langle$SFR$\rangle$-$v\_{\rm max}$ relations before and after reionisation. We find that the SMHM scatter is small at reionisation, $\sim$0.2 dex, but rises to $\sim$0.5 dex ($1\sigma$) at a halo mass of $\sim$10$^9$ M$\_\odot$ as star formation is quenched by reionisation but dark matter halo masses continue to grow. While we do not find a significant break in the slope of the SMHM relation, one can be introduced if reionisation occurs early ($z\_{\rm quench} \gtrsim 5$). Finally, we find that dwarfs can be star forming today down to a halo mass of $\sim$2 $\times 10^9$ M$\_\odot$. We predict that the lowest mass star forming dwarf irregulars in the nearby universe are the tip of the iceberg of a much larger population of quiescent isolated dwarfs.

2024-08-27, **Dynamical Systems Analysis of f(R,G) Cosmological Model with Dark Sector Coupling**, Shivani Sharma et.al., [2408.14989v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14989v1)

 In this article, we examine the dynamical system of $f(R,\mathcal{G})$ gravity model. This $f(R,G)$ model framework is composed of the interactions between dark matter and scalar field through the linear coupling term. The key objective of present study is to describe the cosmological viability of modified gravity theory formulated with the $ f(R, \mathcal{G}) $ gravity. We transform the cosmological equations into an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations by suitable transformation of variables. The $ f(R,\mathcal{G})$ model governed by $ f(R, \mathcal{G}) = \alpha R^m + \beta \mathcal{G}^n $ has been investigated in detail to characterize the stability properties of the critical points of the autonomous system. The model may explain the late-time accelerating universe expansion corresponding to the attractor in model. Depending on the effective equation of state parameter values corresponding to the critical points, we study the observational viability of model using low-redshift observational data such as the observational Hubble data and Pantheon data. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of parameters by using the effective equation of state parameter and statefinder diagnostics.

2024-08-27, **The Fluorescence Camera of the POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR): Design and Scientific goals**, Matteo Battisti et.al., [2408.14867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14867v1)

 The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a proposed payload to fly on a NASA Super Pressure Balloon (SPB). It will act as a pathfinder of the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) detector. PBR will consist of an innovative hybrid focal surface featuring a Fluorescence Camera (FC, based on Multi-Anode Photomultiplier Tubes [MAPMTs], 1.05 $\mu$s time resolution) and a Cherenkov Camera (based on SiPMs, 10 ns time resolution), both mounted on the same tiltable frame that can point from nadir up to 13$^\circ$ above the horizon. The FC's main scientific goal is to observe, for the first time, the fluorescence emission of Extensive Air Showers produced by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays from sub-orbital altitudes. This measurement will validate the detection strategy for future space-based missions, such as POEMMA. As a secondary goal, the FC will perform a search for macroscopic dark matter through slowly evolving showers that will leave a signal similar to (but distinct from) a meteor. PBR targets a launch in 2027 as a payload of an ultra-long duration balloon flight with a duration of up to 100 days.

2024-08-27, **Search for lepton portal dark matter in the PandaX-4T experiment**, PandaX Collaboration et.al., [2408.14730v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14730v1)

 We report a search for a lepton-portal dark matter model, where dark matter couples to a charged lepton in the standard model. This simplified model naturally leads to photon-mediated dark matter interactions with nuclei, making it suitable for direct dark matter detection experiments. Matching to the framework of non-relativistic effective field theory for dark matter, we report the first sensitive search for this model using data from the PandaX-4T commissioning run. Our results yield strong constraints on Dirac fermion dark matter but relatively weaker constraints on Majorana dark matter due to the suppression of effective photon interactions. These constraints complement those obtained from the collider and indirect detection experiments.

2024-08-27, **The impact of dark matter on tidal signatures in neutron star mergers with Einstein Telescope**, Hauke Koehn et.al., [2408.14711v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14711v1)

 If dark matter (DM) accumulates inside neutron stars (NS), it changes their internal structure and causes a shift of the tidal deformability from the value predicted by the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In principle, this shift could be observable in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We investigate the effect of fermionic, non-interacting DM when observing a large number of GW events from DM-admixed BNSs with the precision of the proposed Einstein telescope (ET). Specifically, we study the impact on the recovery of the baryonic EOS and whether DM properties can be constrained. For this purpose, we create event catalogues of BNS mock events with DM fraction up to 1%, from which we reconstruct the posterior uncertainties with the Fisher matrix approach. Using this data, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the baryonic EOS, DM particle mass, and DM particle fraction in each event. Our results reveal that when falsely ignoring DM effects, the EOS posterior is biased towards softer EOSs, though the offset is rather small. Further, we find that within our assumptions of our DM model and population, ET will likely not be able to test the presence of DM in BNSs, even when combining many events and adding Cosmic Explorer (CE) to the next-generation detector network. Likewise, the potential constraints on the DM particle mass will remain weak because of degeneracies with the fraction and EOS.

 In the core-collapse scenario, the supernova remnants evolve inside the complex wind-blown bubbles, structured by massive progenitors during their lifetime. Therefore, particle acceleration and the emissions from these SNRs can carry the fingerprints of the evolutionary sequences of the progenitor stars.   We time-dependently investigate the impact of the ambient environment of core-collapse SNRs on particle spectra and the emissions. We use the RATPaC code to model the particle acceleration at the SNRs with progenitors having ZAMS masses of 20 Msol and 60 Msol. We have constructed the pre-supernova circumstellar medium by solving the hydrodynamic equations for the lifetime of the progenitor stars. Then, the transport equation for cosmic rays, and magnetic turbulence in test-particle approximation along with the induction equation for the evolution of large-scale magnetic field have been solved simultaneously with the hydrodynamic equations for the expansion of SNRs inside the pre-supernova CSM.   The structure of the wind bubbles along with the magnetic field and the scattering turbulence regulate the spectra of accelerated particles for both SNRs. For the 60 Msol progenitor the spectral index reaches 2.4 even below 10 GeV during the propagation of the SNR shock inside the hot shocked wind. In contrast, we have not observed persistent soft spectra at earlier evolutionary stages of the SNR with 20 Msol progenitor, for which the spectral index becomes 2.2 only for a brief period. Later, the spectra become soft above ~10 GeV for both SNRs, as weak driving of turbulence permits the escape of high-energy particles from the remnants. The emission morphology of the SNRs strongly depends on the type of progenitors. For instance, the radio morphology of the SNR with 20 Msol progenitor is centre-filled at early stages whereas that for the more massive progenitor is shell-like.

 We report a result of plasma diagnostics of the supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 400.2, which has been reported to have a recombining plasma (RP) by previous studies. For careful background estimation, we simultaneously fitted spectra extracted from the SNR and background regions and evaluated the SNR emission contaminating the background-region spectrum as well as the background emission in the source-region spectrum. The SNR emission is explained by the collisional ionization equilibrium plasma originating from the interstellar medium and the ionizing plasma originating from the ejecta, in contrast to the previous studies. In addition, we found an unidentified X-ray source near the SNR, Suzaku J1937.4+1718, which is accompanied by an emission line at ~4.4~keV with the 2.8$\sigma$ confidence level. Since there is no striking atomic line at the energy in the rest frame, Suzaku J1937.4+1718 can be an extragalactic object with a redshifted Fe line.

 Quasars could serve as standard candles if the relation between their ultraviolet and X-ray luminosities can be accurately calibrated. Previously, we developed a model-independent method to calibrate quasar standard candles using the distances-redshift relation reconstructed from Type Ia supernova at z<2 using Gaussian process regression. Interestingly, we found that the calibrated quasar standard candle dataset preferred a deviation from $\Lambda$CDM at redshifts above z>2. One interpretation of these findings is that the calibration parameters of the quasar UV-X-ray luminosity relationship evolves with redshift. In order to test the redshift dependence of the quasar calibration in a model-independent manner, we divided the quasar sample whose redshift overlap with the redshift coverage of Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation into two sub-samples: a low-redshift quasar sub-sample and a high-redshift quasar sub-sample. Our present results show that there is about a 4$\sigma$ inconsistency between the quasar parameters inferred from the high-redshift quasar sub-sample and from the low-redshift sub-sample if no evolution of the quasar relation is considered. This inconsistency suggests the necessity of considering redshift evolution for the relationship between the quasars$'$ ultraviolet and X-ray luminosities. We then test an explicit parametrization of the redshift evolution of the quasar calibration parameters via $\gamma(z) = \gamma\_0+\gamma\_1(1+z)$ and $\beta(z)=\beta\_0+\beta\_1(1+z)$. Combining this redshift-dependent calibration relationship with the distance-redshift relationship reconstructed from Pantheon+ supernova compilation, we find the high-redshift sub-sample and low-redshift sub-sample become consistent at the 1$\sigma$ level, which means that the parameterized form of $\gamma(z)$ and $\beta(z)$ works well at describing the evolution of the quasar calibration parameters.

2024-08-27, **Constraining Dust Formation in the Superluminous Supernova 2017gci with JWST Observations**, Sebastian Gomez et.al., [2408.15397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15397v1)

 We present JWST/MIRI observations of the Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN) 2017gci taken over 2000 rest-frame days after the supernova (SN) exploded, which represent the latest phase images taken of any known SLSN. We find that archival \WISE detections of SN\,2017gci taken 70 to 200 days after explosion are most likely explained by an IR dust echo from a $\sim 3 \times 10^{-4}$ M$\_\odot$ shell of pre-existing dust, as opposed to freshly-formed dust. New JWST observations reveal IR emission in the field of SN\,2017gci, which we determine is most likely dominated by the host galaxy of the SN, based on the expected flux of the galaxy and the measurable separation between said emission and the location of the SN. Based on models for IR emission of carbonate dust, we place a $3\sigma$ upper limit of $0.83$ M$\_\odot$ of dust formed in SN\,2017gci, with a lowest $1\sigma$ limit of $0.44$ M$\_\odot$. Infrared (IR) detections of other SLSNe have suggested that SLSNe could be among the most efficient dust producers in the universe. Our results suggest that SLSNe do not necessarily form more dust than other types of SNe, but instead might have a more accelerated dust formation process. More IR observations of a larger sample of SLSNe will be required to determine how efficient dust production is in SLSNe.

2024-08-27, **A Yebes W band Line Survey towards an Unshocked Molecular Cloud of Supernova Remnant 3C391: Evidence of Cosmic-Ray-Induced Chemistry**, Tian-Yu Tu et.al., [2408.15175v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15175v1)

 Cosmic rays (CRs) have strong influences on the chemistry of dense molecular clouds (MCs). To study the detailed chemistry induced by CRs, we conducted a Yebes W band line survey towards an unshocked MC (which we named as 3C391:NML) associated with supernova remnant (SNR) 3C391. We detected emission lines of 18 molecular species in total and estimated their column densities with local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE analysis. Using the abundance ratio N(HCO+)/N(CO) and an upper limit of N(DCO+)/N(HCO+), we estimated the CR ionization rate of 3C391:NML is $\zeta\gtrsim 2.7\times 10^{-14}\rm \ s^{-1}$ with an analytic method. However, we caution on adopting this value because chemical equilibrium, which is a prerequisite of using the equations, is not necessarily reached in 3C391:NML. We observed lower N(HCO+)/N(HOC+), higher N(HCS+)/N(CS), and higher X($l$-C3H+) by an order of magnitude in 3C391:NML than the typical values in quiescent dense MCs. We found that an enhanced CR ionization rate (of order $\sim 10^{-15}$ or $\sim 10^{-14}\rm \ s^{-1}$) is needed to reproduce the observation with chemical model. This is higher than the values found in typical MCs by 2--3 orders of magnitude.

2024-08-27, **Sample of hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility**, P. J. Pessi et.al., [2408.15086v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15086v1)

 Hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae (SLSNe II) are rare. The exact mechanism producing their extreme light curve peaks is not understood. Analysis of single events and small samples suggest that CSM interaction is the main responsible for their features. However, other mechanisms can not be discarded. Large sample analysis can provide clarification. We aim to characterize the light curves of a sample of 107 SLSNe II to provide valuable information that can be used to validate theoretical models. We analyze the gri light curves of SLSNe II obtained through ZTF. We study peak absolute magnitudes and characteristic timescales. When possible we compute g-r colors, pseudo-bolometric light curves, and estimate lower limits for their total radiated energy. We also study the luminosity distribution of our sample and estimate the percentage of them that would be observable by the LSST. Finally, we compare our sample to other H-rich SNe and to H-poor SLSNe I. SLSNe II are heterogeneous. Their median peak absolute magnitude is -20.3 mag in optical bands. Their rise can take from two weeks to over three months, and their decline from twenty days to over a year. We found no significant correlations between peak magnitude and timescales. SLSNe II tend to show fainter peaks, longer declines and redder colors than SLSNe I. We present the largest sample of SLSNe II light curves to date, comprising of 107 events. Their diversity could be explained by considering different CSM morphologies. Although, theoretical analysis is needed to explore alternative scenarios. Other luminous transients, such as Active Galactic Nuclei, Tidal Disruption Events or SNe Ia-CSM, can easily become contaminants. Thus, good multi-wavelength light curve coverage becomes paramount. LSST could miss 30 percent of the ZTF events in the its footprint in gri bands. Redder bands become important to construct complete samples.

2024-08-27, **Unveiling the central engine of core-collapse supernovae in the Local Universe: NS or BH?**, Maurice H. P. M. van Putten et.al., [2408.15017v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15017v1)

 The physical trigger powering supernovae following the core collapse of massive stars is believed to involve a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH), depending largely on progenitor mass. A potentially distinct signature is a long-duration gravitational wave (GW) burst from BH central engines by their ample energy reservoir $E\_J$ in angular momentum, far more so than an NS can provide. A natural catalyst for this radiation is surrounding high-density matter in the form of a non-axisymmetric disk or torus. Here, we derive a detailed outlook on LVK probes of core-collapse supernovae CC-SNe during the present observational run O4 based on their event rate, an association with normal long GRBs and mass-scaling of GW170817B/GRB170817A. For BH central engines of mass $M$, GW170817B predicts a descending GW-chirp of energy ${\cal E}\_{GW}\simeq 3.5\% M\_\odot c^2 \left(M/M\_0\right)$ at frequency $f\_{GW}\lesssim 700\,{\rm Hz}\left(M\_0/M\right)$, where $M\_0\simeq 2.8\,M\_\odot$. For a few tens of events per year well into the Local Universe within 50-100Mpc, probes at the detector-limited sensitivity are expected to break the degeneracy between their NS or BH central engines {by GW calorimetry.

2024-08-27, **Analysing Hubble Tension and Gravitational Waves for $f(Q,T)$ Gravity Theories**, Shreya Banerjee et.al., [2408.14878v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14878v1)

 In this work, we examine viable models of $f(Q,T)$ gravity theories against observational data with the aim to constrain the parameter space of these models. We have analysed five different models of $f(Q,T)$ gravity and tested them against Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometer data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations data and Pantheon data. We put stringent constraints on the $f(Q,T)$ gravity models, $f(Q,T) = Q^{n} +\beta T$ $(n=1,2,3)$, $f(Q,T)=-\alpha Q-\beta T^{2}$ and $f(Q,T)=Q^{-2}T^{2}$ along with other cosmological parameters such as deceleration parameter, equation of state parameter and demonstrate their alignment with the $\Lambda CDM$ model and the observational data. We show that these models have the capability to alleviate the Hubble tension, by predicting the present value of the Hubble parameter close to $74$km/s/Mpc. $f(Q,T)$ gravity theory introduces alterations in the background evolution and imposes a friction term in the propagation of gravitational waves, this phenomenon has also been examined. We have shown their agreement with the Gravitational Wave (GW) luminosity distance with the Electromagnetic (EM) counter part data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced VIRGO across different observing runs capturing coalescence of Binary Neutron Stars (BNS), mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBHs), and Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) binaries with EM counterparts.

2024-08-27, **Constraints on Redshift-Binned Dark Energy using DESI BAO Data**, Ye-Huang Pang et.al., [2408.14787v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14787v1)

 We parameterize the equation of state of late-time dark energy as $w\_{\mathrm{bin}}(z)$, with three redshift bins, characterized by a constant equation of state in each bin. Then, we constrain the parameters of the $w\_{\mathrm{bin}}$CDM model using datasets from DESI BAO data, Planck CMB power spectrum, ACT DR6 lensing power spectrum, and type Ia supernova distance-redshift data of Pantheon Plus/DES Y5/Union3. The significances for $w\_1>-1$ is $1.9\sigma$, $2.6\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$, and $w\_2$ is consistent with $-1$ within $1\sigma$ level, while $1.6\sigma$, $1.5\sigma$ and $1.5\sigma$ for $w\_3<-1$ in these three data combinations with different choices of type Ia supernova datasets, respectively. Additionally, to alleviate $H\_0$ tension, we incorporate the early dark energy (EDE) model in the early-time universe and add the SH0ES absolute magnitude $M\_b$ prior (or $H\_0$ prior) to further constrain the $w\_{\mathrm{bin}}$EDE model. In the $w\_{\mathrm{bin}}$EDE model, we find a $w\_{\mathrm{bin}}(z)$ pattern similar to that in the $w\_{\mathrm{bin}}$CDM model. The results of the three data combinations exhibit $w\_1>-1$ at $1.9\sigma$, $1.7\sigma$ and $2.9\sigma$ level, meanwhile $w\_3<-1$ at $1.3\sigma$, $1.3\sigma$ and $1.3\sigma$ level, respectively. In all, our results indicate that the transition of dark energy from phantom at high redshifts to quintessence at low redshifts is not conclusive.
