2025-09-11, **Cosmic $τ$ensions Indirectly Correlate with Reionization Optical Depth**, Itamar J. Allali et.al., [2509.09678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09678v1)

 The reionization optical depth $\tau\_{\rm reio}$ has interesting connections to existing cosmological anomalies. As first studied in the context of the Hubble tension in our previous paper, a larger $\tau\_{\rm reio}$, which could be achieved by removing the Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data, could boost $H\_0$ slightly, resulting in a mild reduction of the tension between the early- and late-universe determinations of $H\_0$. It has been shown later that a larger $\tau\_{\rm reio}$ could also relieve other anomalies including: the tension between BAO and CMB data, the neutrino mass tension, and the latest DESI plus supernovae data's tension with the standard cosmological constant scenario. In this paper, we systematically analyze the correlations between $\tau\_{\rm reio}$ and relevant cosmological parameters in the existing cosmic observation anomalies. In addition to Pearson correlation coefficients extracted directly from the covariance matrix, we also study partial correlation coefficients which measure intrinsic relationships between pairs of parameters removing the influence of other parameters. We show that $\tau\_{\rm reio}$ has weak intrinsic correlations with the parameters responsible for the tensions and anomalies discussed. The large direct Pearson correlations that allow larger $\tau\_{\rm reio}$ inferences to alleviate the cosmological tensions each arise from complicated networks through multiple parameters. As a result, the relationships between $\tau\_{\rm reio}$ and each anomaly are not independent of each other. We also employ our method of computing correlations to clarify the impact of large scale polarization data, and comment also on the effects of CMB observations from ACT and SPT.

2025-09-11, **Ultra-high energy event KM3-230213A as a cosmogenic neutrino in light of minimal UHECR flux models**, M. Yu. Kuznetsov et.al., [2509.09590v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09590v1)

 Recently, the KM3NeT experiment reported the detection of a neutrino with exceptionally high energy E = 220 PeV, whose origin remains unclear. The corresponding value of the neutrino flux is in tension with the results of other high-energy neutrino experiments. In this study, we discuss the possibility that this neutrino is cosmogenic, i. e., produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) during their propagation through the intergalactic medium. We adopt the UHECR flux models derived by the Telescope Array experiment, which features a predominantly light mass composition. We show that the predictions of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in these models are consistent with the measurements of the KM3NeT-only and with that of the "global neutrino observatory" at approximately 2${\sigma}$ level. Notably, this result is achieved in a minimal version of the UHECR flux models, that assume one source population with a standard cosmological evolution. We also estimate the corresponding cosmogenic gamma-ray flux and show that it is consistent with Fermi-LAT IGRB measurements and UHE gamma-ray limits; the improvement of the latter can probe these predictions in future.

2025-09-11, **Fixed points of classical gravity coupled with a Standard-Model-like theory**, Latham Boyle et.al., [2509.09346v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09346v1)

 Coupling quantum field theory (QFT) \!-\! even free QFT \!-\! to gravity leads to well-known problems. In particular, the stress tensor $T\_{\mu\nu}$ (gravity's source) and its correlators typically diverge in the UV, creating a conflict between the wildly inhomogeneous spacetime we expect quantum mechanically and the weakly-curved, macroscopic spacetime we observe. Are there QFTs for which these divergences cancel? Here, for simplicity, we consider free quantum fields on a classical curved background. The aforementioned divergences are related to the running of the gravitational couplings. We calculate the corresponding beta functions, identifying a special class of QFTs with UV fixed points at which $\langle T\_{\mu\nu}\rangle$ and all its correlators $\langle T\ldots T\rangle$ are UV finite. An intriguing example is a theory like the Standard Model (including right-handed neutrinos) with $12$ gauge fields, $3$ generations of $16$ Weyl fermions and $36$ four-derivative (Fradkin-Tseytlin) scalars. In the infrared, this theory has a positive Newton's constant $G$ and an arbitrarily small cosmological constant $\Lambda$.

2025-09-11, **Determination of CKM matrix element and axial vector form factors from weak decays of quantum-entangled strange baryons**, BESIII Collaboration et.al., [2509.09266v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09266v1)

 The electromagnetic structure of the nucleon can be determined from the scattering of electrons off a nucleon target. However, to study its axial structure, neutrino beams are required. The results from these experiments should be extrapolated to zero energy-momentum transfers to access the static properties of the nucleon. For baryons with strange quarks, hyperons, the static limit can instead be approached in semi-leptonic decays, which give direct access to the weak magnetism and axial-vector coupling strengths that are inaccessible in electromagnetic interactions. The axial-vector coupling as while weak magnetism coupling and the overall normalization, given by form factor $f\_1$, are being determined with increased precision from the theory of strong interactions using a first principles formulation on the space--time lattice. Furthermore, the probability of the semi-leptonic hyperon decay is approximately proportional to $\|V\_{us}\|^2\cdot (f\_1^2+3g\_1^2)$, where $V\_{us}$ is the CKM matrix element responsible for the transition between an $s$ and a $u$ quark. Current determinations of $\|V\_{us}\|$ come from kaon decays, but the results are not consistent and could indicate a deviation from CKM matrix unitarity, a tell-tale sign of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles. Here we determine the absolute branching fraction and weak coupling strengths for $\Lambda\to p e^-\bar\nu\_e$, and $\bar \Lambda\to \bar p e^+\nu\_e$. These observables combined with form factors determined from first-principle lattice QCD calculations allow for the extraction of the $\|V\_{us}\|$ value. We demonstrate how $\|V\_{us}\|$ can be extracted with increasing sensitivity using polarized hyperons from entangled, baryon-antibaryon pairs, thus enabling a complementary road to that of meson decays. In addition, the presented experimental method can be used for other semileptonic decays of baryons.

2025-09-11, **Reionization optical depth and CMB-BAO tension in punctuated inflation**, Zhiqi Huang et.al., [2509.09086v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09086v1)

 Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We provide a physical explanation for this negative result.

2025-09-10, **Cosmic Ray Spatial Distribution and the Galactic/Extragalactic Transition**, Paolo Lipari et.al., [2509.09028v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09028v1)

 Determining the spatial distribution of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) is fundamental to understand how these particles propagate in interstellar space and to infer their source spectra. The most sensitive method of studying this problem is observing the gamma--ray and neutrino diffuse fluxes produced in the inelastic interactions of CR protons and nuclei with interstellar gas that encode the energy and spatial distributions of the interacting particles. Most theoretical models assume that the spatial and energy dependencies of the spectra of CR protons and nuclei are factorized, so that the CR energy spectra have the same shape at all points of the Milky Way. However, on the base of the Fermi--LAT observations, some authors have tentatively inferred that particles in the inner regions of the Milky Way have significantly harder spectra. Recently the ground--based telescopes Tibet--AS$\gamma$, LHAASO and HAWC have extended the measurements of the diffuse gamma--ray flux to much higher energies, and the IceCube neutrino telescope has obtained evidence for a $\nu$ flux from the Galactic disk. These new measurements allow for new tests of the factorization hypothesis, and disfavor models in which the spectral shape of CR protons and nuclei is harder in the inner part of the Galaxy. In fact, the LHAASO data above 30~TeV are in better agreement with the opposite hypothesis, that cosmic rays is the inner Galaxy have softer spectra than those in the outer Galaxy. This result, that has currently only modest significance due to large statistical and systematic uncertainties, could be explained by assuming that the CR confinement volume increases with energy. An alternative explanation is that a significant fraction of cosmic rays in the multi--PeV energy range is of extragalactic origin.

2025-09-10, **Microscopic calculation of two-particle-two-hole meson-exchange currents in $^{40}$Ar and asymmetric scaling properties for neutrino and electron scattering**, V. L. Martinez-Consentino et.al., [2509.08916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08916v1)

 We present a microscopic calculation of two particle-two hole meson exchange current response functions in asymmetric nuclei, with particular emphasis on the $^{40}$Ar nucleus. Employing a relativistic mean-field and relativistic Fermi gas framework, we compute the nuclear response for $^{40}$Ar and compare it with that of the symmetric $^{40}$Ca nucleus, analyzing the role of proton-neutron imbalance. The model incorporates distinct proton and neutron Fermi momenta to accurately capture the nuclear dynamics of systems with $Z \neq N$. Our results indicate that using $^{40}$Ca as a proxy for $^{40}$Ar leads to a systematic error of approximately 10\%. Additionally, we propose an asymmetric scaling formula to obtain the 2p2h response for arbitrary nuclei from the $^{12}$C response, improving the description of asymmetric nuclei. Finally, we benchmark our predictions against inclusive electron scattering and neutrino cross sections.

2025-09-10, **nuSTORM as a Precision Probe of the Standard Model and New Physics**, Jack Franklin et.al., [2509.08882v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08882v1)

 The Neutrinos from Stored Muons (nuSTORM) facility will generate neutrino beams from both muon and meson decays in a storage ring, providing a neutrino flux known to the percent level. This unprecedented precision enables a rich physics programme, including high-precision tests of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. In this paper we demonstrate nuSTORM's sensitivity to key Standard Model processes such as, measurements of the weak mixing angle at low $Q^2$ and the rare process of neutrino trident production. We also show its powerful reach for a diverse range of beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios, including eV-scale sterile neutrinos, Kaluza-Klein excitations from large extra dimensions and lepton flavour violation. Furthermore, nuSTORM can place significant constraints on heavy QCD axions and other axion-like particles produced in rare kaon decays. These capabilities establish nuSTORM as a powerful and complementary probe to long baseline experiments and collider searches.

2025-09-10, **Two-particle two-hole excitations in semi-inclusive neutrino-nucleus scattering**, Valerio Belocchi et.al., [2509.08786v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08786v1)

 A calculation of the two-particle two-hole contribution to the semi-inclusive $(\nu\_\mu,\mu^-N)$ cross section on carbon is performed in the framework of the relativistic Fermi gas model. The process is driven by meson-exchange currents encompassing all contributions involving the exchange of a single pion and the excitation of a $\Delta$ resonance. The calculation is validated against the inclusive $(\nu\_\mu,\mu^-)$ response functions already existing in the literature, and then extended for the first time to the semi-inclusive channel. Results are presented both at fixed neutrino energy and folded with the T2K neutrino flux.

2025-09-10, **Adapting Vision-Language Models for Neutrino Event Classification in High-Energy Physics**, Dikshant Sagar et.al., [2509.08461v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08461v2)

 Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa 3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events. Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

2025-09-10, **Neutrino mass and mixing, resonant leptogenesis and charged lepton flavor violation in a minimal seesaw model with $S_4$ symmetry**, V. V. Vien et.al., [2509.08290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08290v1)

 We propose a minimal inverse seesaw model with $S\_4$ symmetry for the Majorana neutrinos with only one real ($m\_0$)-and two complex ($\alpha, \beta$) parameters in neutrino sector which gives reasonable predictions for the neutrino oscillation parameters, the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe and the charged lepton flavor violation. The resulting model reveals a favor for normal neutrino mass ordering, a higher octant of $\theta\_{23}$ and a lower half-plane of Dirac CP violation phase. The predictions of the model for sum of neutrino masses and the effective Majorana neutrino mass are centered around 58.98 meV and 6.2 meV, respectively. The model also provides the predictions of the baryon asymmetry and charged lepton flavour violation processes which are consistent with the experimental observations.

2025-09-11, **Exploring Coupled Quintessence in light of CMB and DESI DR2 measurements**, Atul Ashutosh Samanta et.al., [2509.09624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09624v1)

 We perform a detailed analysis of a theoretically motivated dark energy quintessence model which interacts with the dark matter sector of the universe. Utilising the current observational datasets from the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Type Ia Supernovae, we constrain the parameters that characterise the strength of the time dependent interaction. We also look at the effect of a warm dark matter component in the context of coupled quintessence. Analysis using Deviance Information Criterion indicates strong preference for the quintessence model coupled with warm dark matter. However, Bayesian evidence analysis shows favor in the direction of $\Lambda$CDM model.

2025-09-11, **Constraints on Ultra-heavy DM from TeV-PeV gamma-ray diffuse measurements**, Manuel Rocamora et.al., [2509.09609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09609v1)

 Recent experiments have measured the Galactic $\gamma$-ray diffuse emission up to PeV energies, opening a window to study acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays and their propagation up to the cosmic-ray knee. Furthermore, these observations provide a powerful tool to set strong constraints into very-heavy dark matter particles, with masses in the TeV-PeV range. In this paper, we explore the potential of the newest observations of diffuse emissions at the Galactic plane from HAWC and LHAASO to probe this kind of dark matter over a wide mass range. Here, we model secondary emissions (inverse-Compton) from the electrons and positrons produced in the annihilation/decay of dark matter, on top of their prompt $\gamma$-ray emission, including the effects of absorption of high-energy photons via pair production. Furthermore, we show that including the astrophysical backgrounds (namely diffuse emission from cosmic-ray collisions or emission from unresolved sources) can significantly improve these limits. We find that the new measurements provided, specially by LHAASO with the combination of the WCDA and KM2A detectors, allow us to set strong constraints in decaying dark matter, being competitive and even improving the strongest constraints at the moment. We also highlight that these regions lead to constraints that are less affected by uncertainties from the dark matter distribution and discuss how CTA north and SWGO will be able to improve limits in this mass range.

2025-09-11, **The emergence of globular clusters and globular-cluster-like dwarfs**, Ethan D. Taylor et.al., [2509.09582v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09582v1)

 Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and densest stellar systems in the Universe, yet how they form remains a mystery. Here we present a suite of cosmological simulations in which both dark-matter-free GCs and dark-matter-rich dwarf galaxies naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology. We show that these objects inhabit distinct locations in the size-luminosity plane and that they have similar ages, age spread, metallicity and metallicity spread to globulars and dwarfs in the nearby Universe. About half of our simulated globulars form by means of regular star formation near the centres of their host dwarf, with the rest forming further out, triggered by mergers. The latter are more tidally isolated and more likely to survive to the present day. Finally, our simulations predict the existence of a new class of object that we call 'globular-cluster-like dwarfs' (GCDs). These form from a single, self-quenching, star-formation event in low-mass dark-matter halos at high redshift and have observational properties intermediate between globulars and dwarfs. We identify several dwarfs in our Galaxy, such as Reticulum II (refs. 2-4), that could be in this new class. If so, they promise unprecedented constraints on dark-matter models and new sites to search for metal-free stars.

2025-09-11, **On Lagrangian formulations for (ir)reducible mixed-antisymmetric higher integer spin fields in Minkowski spaces**, Alexander A. Reshetnyak et.al., [2509.09490v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09490v1)

 We extend the results of Lagrangian formulations study to construct gauge-invariant Lagrangians for (ir)reducible integer higher-spin massless and massive representations of the Poincare group with a Young tableau $Y[\hat{s}\_1,\hat{s}\_2,\hat{s}\_3]$ in $d$-dimensional flat space-time (as the probable candidates to describe the Dark Matter problem beyond the SM). These particles are described within a metric-like formulation by tensor fields with 3 groups of antisymmetric Lorentz indices $\Phi\_{\mu^1[{\hat{s}\_1}],\mu^2[{\hat{s}\_2}], \mu^3[{\hat{s}\_3}]}$ on a basis of the   BRST method with complete, $Q$, and incomplete, $Q\_c$, BRST operators. We found unconstrained (with $Q$) and constrained (with $Q\_c$ and off-shell BRST invariant holonomic constraints) gauge Lagrangian formulations with different configuration spaces and reducibility stages. The deformation procedure to construct interacting gauge model with mixed-antisymmetric fields is proposed.

2025-09-11, **Interacting k-essence field with non-pressureless Dark Matter: Cosmological Dynamics and Observational Constraints**, Saddam Hussain et.al., [2509.09202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09202v1)

 We investigate a class of interacting dark energy and dark matter (DM) models, where dark energy is modeled as a $k$-essence scalar field with an inverse-square potential. Two general forms of interaction are considered: one proportional to the Hubble parameter, and another independent of the Hubble parameter, depending instead on combinations of the energy densities and pressures of the dark sectors. The dynamics are analyzed using a dynamical system stability framework by constructing an autonomous system of equations. The models are tested against a wide range of observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), BAO measurements from DESI DR2, compressed Planck data (PLA), Pantheon+ (PP), DES supernovae, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and strong lensing data from H0LiCOW (HCW). The analysis shows that the models consistently reproduce all major cosmological epochs and yield statistically competitive results compared to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The models exhibit stable late-time de-Sitter solutions, ensuring ghost-free evolution, with the Hubble constant in the range $H\_0 \sim 67$--$70$ km/s/Mpc.

2025-09-10, **Decays and annihilation of galactic dark matter: determine $D$-, $J_s$-, $J_p$- and $J_d$-factors with dark matter profiles inferred from GravSphere fit to stellar observations**, Fedor Bezrukov et.al., [2509.09012v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09012v1)

 Dark matter mass density profiles and velocity distributions for a set of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) have recently been obtained (F.Bezrukov, D.Gorbunov, E.Koreshkova arXiv:2412.20585) by performing a multi-parametric fit to the stellar observations with the help of the GravSphere which solves the Jeans equation. We use these results to calculate the geometrical factors for estimation of the fluxes of cosmic rays expected from decay ($D$-factor) and annihilation ($J\_s$-, $J\_p$- and $J\_d$-factors for $s$-, $p$- and $d$- wave processes) of dark matter particles in galaxies. The general novelty is the account for a possible anisotropy in velocities of dark matter particles. On the basis of this analysis we present empirical scaling approximations to these factors as functions of typical observables: distance to the galaxy $d$, it's half-radius $r\_h$ and line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma\_{LOS}$. They can be applied to any galaxy, and for $D$- and $J\_s$-factors we refine the estimates of (Andrew B. Pace, Louis E. Strigari arXiv:1802.06811): the shifts in the central values remain within 1-2$\sigma$ error bars.

2025-09-10, **Constraining Dark Photon Dark Matter with Radio Silence from Soliton Mergers around Supermassive Black Holes**, Dorian W. P. Amaral et.al., [2509.08932v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08932v1)

 We place the first constraints on the dark matter fraction contained within dark photon solitons using the absence of their predicted radio-frequency signatures, or radio silence, following mergers around supermassive black holes. In these dense environments, spiky dark matter density profiles can form that enhance the soliton merger rate. We present a novel estimate of this rate by incorporating both the steepened dark matter profile and the soliton velocity dispersion via the Jeans equation. For galaxies with an initial profile $\rho\_\mathrm{DM} \propto r^{-1}$, we find the total merger rate across redshifts $0 \leq z \leq 4$ to be $\Gamma\_{\text{merg}}^{\text{TOTAL}} \lesssim 10^{-7}f^2\_{\text{DM}}\,\text{Mpc}^{-3}\,\text{day}^{-1}$, where $f\_\mathrm{DM}$ is the solitonic fraction of dark matter. This enhanced rate leads to more major merger events in which the generated soliton has a mass exceeding a critical threshold, leading to its decay via the parametric resonance phenomenon that produces brief, narrowband, and energetic radio bursts detectable by fast radio burst surveys. Comparing our predictions with the non-observation of such events, we already obtain $f\_\mathrm{DM} \lesssim 10^{-1}$ from the first fast radio burst study. This constraint is strengthened to $f\_\mathrm{DM} \lesssim 10^{-2}$ from the Parkes HTRU survey, with CHIME projected to tighten this to $f\_\mathrm{DM} \lesssim 10^{-3}$. For larger $f\_\mathrm{DM}$, we instead constrain the effective coupling strength between the dark and visible sectors to lie outside $10^{-18}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}} \lesssim g \lesssim 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-6}\,\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Our results establish astrophysical transients as powerful probes of dark sectors, opening a window onto the detectability of ultralight vector fields.

 The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) is one of the most productive and influential photometric sky surveys in the history of observational astronomy. Originally designed to detect dark matter through gravitational microlensing events, OGLE has evolved into a cornerstone of time-domain astrophysics, delivering three decades of two-band, high-cadence observations of approximately two billion stars across the Galactic bulge, disk, and Magellanic System. This review summarizes OGLE's key contributions to variable star research, including the discovery, classification and characterization of pulsating stars, eclipsing, ellipsoidal, and rotating variables, or irregular and eruptive stars. Particular emphasis is placed on the OGLE Collection of Variable Stars (OCVS), a publicly available and systematically expanded dataset that has become a fundamental resource for studies of stellar variability and evolution, Milky Way and other galaxies structure, microlensing, compact objects, exoplanets and more. The synergy between OGLE and other major sky surveys, including ASAS, ASAS-SN, ATLAS, Gaia, KMTNet, MACHO, MOA, TESS, PLATO, or ZTF further amplifies its scientific reach.

2025-09-10, **Parity Violation in Galaxy Shapes: Primordial Non-Gaussianity**, Toshiki Kurita et.al., [2509.08787v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08787v1)

 We present a comprehensive study of galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA) as a probe of parity-violating primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we show that the parity-odd IA power spectrum is sensitive to the collapsed limit of the parity-odd primordial trispectrum. For a $U(1)$-gauge inflationary model, the IA power spectrum is proportional to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation, $P\_\zeta(k) \propto k^{-3}$. However, the proportionality constants contain not only the PNG amplitude but also undetermined EFT bias parameters. We use $N$-body simulations to determine the bias parameters for dark matter halos. Using these bias parameters, we forecast IA's constraining power, assuming data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that the IA power spectrum can improve the current limits on the amplitude of parity-violating PNG derived from galaxy four-point correlation and CMB trispectrum analyses. Moreover, galaxy shapes are complementary to these probes as they are sensitive to different scales and trispectrum configurations. Beyond galaxy shapes, we develop a new method to generate initial conditions for simulations and forward models from the parity-odd trispectrum with an enhanced collapsed limit.

2025-09-10, **An improved model for the effect of correlated Si-III absorption on the one-dimensional Lyman-$α$ forest power spectrum**, Ke Ma et.al., [2509.08613v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08613v1)

 We present an analysis of Si-III absorption and its effect on the 1D Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum using the Sherwood-Relics hydrodynamical simulation suite. In addition to the well-understood oscillations arising from the Ly$\alpha$--Si-III cross correlation, we find an enhancement in small-scale power that has been ignored in previous studies. We therefore develop a new analytical fitting function that captures two critical effects that have previously been neglected: distinct Ly$\alpha$ and Si-III line profiles, and a variable ratio for coeval Ly$\alpha$ and Si-III optical depths. In contrast to earlier work, we also predict amplitudes for the Si-III power spectrum and Ly$\alpha$--Si-III cross power spectrum that decrease toward lower redshift due to the hardening metagalactic UV background spectrum at $z\lesssim 3.5$. The fitting function is validated by comparison against multiple simulated datasets at redshifts $2.2\leq z \leq 5.0$ and wavenumbers $k < 0.2\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$. Our model remains in good agreement with earlier work at large scales ($k \lesssim 0.06\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$) and it has little effect on existing warm dark matter constraints from the Ly$\alpha$ forest when adopting a physically motivated prior on the silicon abundance. It will, however, be an essential consideration for future, high-precision Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum measurements.

2025-09-10, **Gravitational radiation reaction around a static black hole surrounded by a Dehnen type dark matter halo**, Amjad Ashoorioon et.al., [2509.08569v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08569v1)

 We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Such a system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the particle's orbit evolves under radiation reaction. We also consider the effects of dynamical friction and accretion of DM on the orbital parameters. We find that the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum decrease faster with respect to the case in which EMRI is in empty spacetime.

2025-09-10, **Search for a photon peak from keV-scale dark matter annihilation with NuSTAR: Constraints on $\langle σv \rangle$ after 11 years of observations**, E. I. Zakharov et.al., [2509.08506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08506v1)

 We report new constraints on the velocity-independent annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ of keV-scale dark matter particles based on 11 years of observations with the NuSTAR X-ray telescope. Using the unfocused stray light mode of the instrument, which provides a wide field-of-view and a stable instrumental background, we perform a sensitive search for photon signatures from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic halo. We model the resulting diffuse X-ray spectrum over the 3-20 keV energy range and search for line-like spectral features that may arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles into photons. No statistically significant excess over the expected astrophysical background is found. We therefore place upper limits on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ as a function of dark matter mass, assuming a velocity-independent s-wave annihilation and several Galactic dark matter profiles. Across most of the explored mass range our results provide the strongest X-ray constraints to date, reaching the level of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \lesssim 10^{-33}$ -- $10^{-34}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and they are complementary to the most recent bounds derived from SRG/ART-XC observations.

 Direct measurements of the matter power spectrum, $P\_\mathrm{m}(k,z)$, provide a powerful tool to investigate observed tensions between models of structure growth while also testing the internal consistency of cosmological probes. We analyse cosmic shear data from the final data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), presenting a deprojected $P\_\mathrm{m}(k,z)$, measured in up to three redshift bins. Compared to analyses using previous KiDS releases, we find improved internal consistency in the $z\lesssim0.7$ regime. At large scales, $k\lesssim0.1\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$, our power spectrum reconstruction aligns with $\Lambda$CDM predictions with a density fluctuation amplitude $\sigma\_8=0.81$. Furthermore, at small scales, $k=3$-$20\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the average matter power spectrum is suppressed by $30\%\pm10\%\,{\rm (stat.)}\pm4\%\,{\rm (sys.)}$ with $2.8\sigma$ significance relative to a dark-matter-only model, consistent with expectations of strong baryonic feedback.

 In the multiverse hypothesis, a range of universes exist with differing values of our physical constants. Here, we investigate how the probabilities of observing our values of these constants depend on the assumptions made about the theories governing particle physics and cosmology, along with habitability. The particle physics effects we consider include constraints on the Higgs vacuum expectation value from big bang nucleosynthesis and supernovae, grand unified theories (GUTs), and standard model stability. Cosmology effects we consider are different theories of dark matter and baryogenesis, and for galactic habitability effects we include star formation efficiency, stellar encounters, supernova explosions, and active galactic nuclei. We find the following to be disfavored in the multiverse scenario: flexible GUTs, pessimistic galactic disruption rates, some origin of life theories, and freeze-out dark matter with high energy baryogenesis. These predictions can be tested in future experiments to either confirm or rule out the multiverse.

 One of the most pressing problems in current cosmology is the cause of the Hubble tension. We revisit a two-rung distance ladder, composed only of Cepheid periods and magnitudes, anchor distances in the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 4258, and host galaxy redshifts. We adopt the SH0ES data for the most up-to-date and carefully vetted measurements, where the Cepheid hosts were selected to harbour also Type Ia supernovae. We introduce two important improvements: a rigorous selection modelling and a state-of-the-art density and peculiar velocity model using Manticore-Local, based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm. We infer $H\_0 = 71.7 \pm 1.3\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, assuming the Cepheid host sample was selected by estimated supernova magnitudes. Less plausible selection criteria shift $H\_0$ by about one standard deviation. The posterior has a lower central value and a 45 per cent smaller error than a previous study using the same data. The result is also slightly lower than the supernova-based SH0ES inferred value of $H\_0 = 73.2 \pm 0.9\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and is in $3.3\sigma$ tension with the latest standard cosmological model microwave background results. These results demonstrate that a measurement of $H\_0$ of sufficient precision to weigh in on the Hubble tension is achievable using second-rung data alone, underscoring the importance of robust and accurate statistical modelling.

 We perform a detailed analysis of a theoretically motivated dark energy quintessence model which interacts with the dark matter sector of the universe. Utilising the current observational datasets from the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Type Ia Supernovae, we constrain the parameters that characterise the strength of the time dependent interaction. We also look at the effect of a warm dark matter component in the context of coupled quintessence. Analysis using Deviance Information Criterion indicates strong preference for the quintessence model coupled with warm dark matter. However, Bayesian evidence analysis shows favor in the direction of $\Lambda$CDM model.

 Convection in the innermost shells of massive stars plays an important role in initiating core-collapse supernovae. When these convective motions reach the supernova shock, they create extra turbulence, which helps energize the explosion. In our earlier work, we studied the effect of rotation on the hydrodynamic evolution of convective vortices in collapsing stars. This study focuses on how rotation influences the entropy perturbations, which naturally form in turbulent convection. As these perturbations are carried inward with the collapsing star, they generate both vorticity and sound waves. Using linear perturbation theory, we model entropy waves as small disturbances on top of a steady background flow. Our results show that stellar rotation has little effect on the evolution of entropy perturbations during collapse, prior to encountering the supernova shock. This outcome is consistent with our earlier findings on the limited influence of rotation in the accretion of convective eddies.

 An international team of researchers has come together to undertake an ultra-broadband exploration of the deep radio sky. The superMIGHTEE project combines data from the MIGHTEE project, using the precursor Square Kilometre Array (SKA) MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, with observations from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India to produce deep images at several $\mu$Jy sensitivity over a frequency range of 200 MHz--2.5 GHz, with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. This paper describes the initial superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release, comprising total intensity continuum images covering a total of 9.9 deg$^2$ at 650 MHz and 6.9 deg$^2$ at 400 MHz in the XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and E-CDFS deep fields. The associated radio source catalogs include 27,101 sources at 650 MHz and 10,946 sources at 400 MHz. The redshift distribution of the sources extends to $z\sim4$ with a median value of $z=1$. An overview of the broadband spectra of the sources, in combination with the MeerKAT MIGHTEE 1280 MHz data, reveals a clear change in spectral properties at the transition from an active galactic nuclei-dominated population to a population dominated by star-forming galaxies at flux densities of a few mJy. At higher frequencies, the star-forming galaxy population exhibits an optically thin synchrotron spectral index indicative of energy injection from supernovae. At lower frequencies, the spectra flatten significantly with decreasing flux density, and the fraction of sources with peaked spectra increases. This is the first superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release. Subsequent releases will include spectropolarimetric and spectral line image cubes, as well as images at lower frequencies. The goal of the superMIGHTEE ultra-wideband dataset is to enhance our understanding of the evolution of active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time, (abridged).

2025-09-11, **Investigating the cosmic distance duality relation with gamma-ray bursts**, Anna Chiara Alfano et.al., [2509.09247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09247v1)

 Deviations from the so-called {\it cosmic distance duality relation} may result from systematic errors in distance measurements or, more interestingly, hint at new physics. Further, it can also be related to the Hubble constant tension between early and local measurements of $H\_0$. Based on this, we test validity of this relation through a model-independent parameterization of the Hubble rate via the well-estabilished B\'ezier polynomials approach. We seek for possible departures from the relation considering three parametrizations, i) a power-law correction, ii) a logarithmic correction and iii) a Pad\'e series $P\_{n,m}(z)$ of order (1;2) with $n=1$ being the order of the numerator while $m=2$ is the order of the denominator. Then, assuming a flat scenario, we test them through Monte Carlo -- Markov chain analyses that combine low- and intermediate/high-$z$ data sets, such as observational Hubble data, the Pantheon catalog of type Ia supernovae, galaxy clusters, the second data release from the DESI Collaboration and gamma-ray bursts. In particular, we distinguish between \emph{Analysis A} and \emph{Analysis C}, depending whether the prompt emission $E\_{iso}-E\_p$ or the prompt-afterglow $L\_0-E\_p-T$ gamma-ray burst correlations, respectively, is fit together with the other probes previously described. Our results seem to point towards a \emph{no violation} of the cosmic distance duality relation and a preference towards Planck's value of $H\_0$.

 We investigate a class of interacting dark energy and dark matter (DM) models, where dark energy is modeled as a $k$-essence scalar field with an inverse-square potential. Two general forms of interaction are considered: one proportional to the Hubble parameter, and another independent of the Hubble parameter, depending instead on combinations of the energy densities and pressures of the dark sectors. The dynamics are analyzed using a dynamical system stability framework by constructing an autonomous system of equations. The models are tested against a wide range of observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), BAO measurements from DESI DR2, compressed Planck data (PLA), Pantheon+ (PP), DES supernovae, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and strong lensing data from H0LiCOW (HCW). The analysis shows that the models consistently reproduce all major cosmological epochs and yield statistically competitive results compared to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The models exhibit stable late-time de-Sitter solutions, ensuring ghost-free evolution, with the Hubble constant in the range $H\_0 \sim 67$--$70$ km/s/Mpc.

2025-09-11, **Binary Black Hole Phase Space Discovers the Signature of Pair Instability Supernovae Mass Gap**, Samsuzzaman Afroz et.al., [2509.09123v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09123v1)

 The rapidly expanding catalog of gravitational-wave detections provides a powerful probe of the formation history of compact binaries across cosmic time. In this work, we extend the Binary Compact Object (BCO) phase-space framework to the full set of events in the GWTC-4 catalog to map the observed binary formation scenarios in a data-driven way. Applying this framework, we identify distinct regions of phase-space associated with different channels and discover for the first time a unique mass-cutoff scale in a data-driven way. The mapping of these on different formation channels reveals a population of first-generation (1G) black holes sharply truncated at approximately 45.5 $M\_\odot$, consistent with the theoretically predicted pair-instability supernova (PISN) mass gap. These findings demonstrate the capability of the BCO phase-space to disentangle overlapping formation pathways, establish robust connections between gravitational-wave observations and binary evolution, and highlight the potential of upcoming observing runs to reveal rare populations and exotic origins.

2025-09-11, **Testing the effect of progenitor's metallicity on $^{56}$Ni mass and constraining the progenitor scenarios in Type Ia supernovae**, Young-Lo Kim et.al., [2509.09069v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09069v1)

 The analytical model found that the intrinsic variation in the initial metallicity of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor stars ($Z\_{progenitor}$) translates into a 25% variation in the $^{56}$Ni mass synthesized and, therefore, 0.2 mag difference in the observed peak luminosity of SNe Ia. Previous observational studies used the currently-observed global gas-phase metallicity of host galaxies, instead of $Z\_{progenitor}$ used in the model, and showed a higher scatter in the $^{56}$Ni mass measurements compared to the model prediction. Here, we use $Z\_{progenitor}$ of 34 normal SNe Ia and employ recent SN Ia explosion models with various configurations to cover the observed $^{56}$Ni mass range. Unlike previous studies, our sample covers the $Z\_{progenitor}$ range, where most of the $Z\_{progenitor}$ effect occurs. Linear regression returns a slope of 0.02+-0.03, which is the opposite trend to the analytical model, but at at low statistical significance level. We find that comparing our sample with SN Ia explosion models on the $Z\_{progenitor}$--$^{56}$Ni mass diagram allows us to constrain the progenitor scenarios. We also explore other chemical composition indicators. For $(Fe/H)\_{progenitor}$, our sample follows the trend predicted by the analytical models, but at a low significance level. Noticeably, $(\alpha/Fe)\_{progenitor}$ shows the opposite trend and a clear gap. When we split the sample at $(\alpha/Fe)\_{progenitor}$ = 0.35 $(\alpha/Fe)\_{\odot}$, we find a 3$\sigma$ difference in the weighted-means of the $^{56}$Ni mass. Lastly, SNe Ia in different $Z\_{progenitor}$ groups show a difference of 0.14+-0.09 mag in the standardized luminosity. The present work highlights a holistic approach (from the progenitor star to the explosion with SN Ia and host galaxy observational data) to understand the underlying physics of SNe Ia for more accurate and precise cosmology.

2025-09-10, **On the Reliability of Quasars as Cosmological Distance Indicators**, Ariadna Montiel et.al., [2509.08983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08983v1)

 The goal of the present paper is to assess the usefulness of quasars as cosmological distance indicators. We calibrate, in a model-independent way, the non-linear relation between X-ray and UV emission to derive quasar luminosity distances. Using this calibration, we construct the Hubble diagram up to redshift $z \sim 7.5$, and test the ability of quasars to constrain the $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega$CDM models at low and high redshifts, in combination with the Type Ia supernova Pantheon Plus sample, as well as the latest results from DESI and Planck Compressed data. We find consistency with previous studies in the values of $\gamma$ and $\beta$ when using a quasar subsample with $z<1.43$. However, when the data is used to constrain the cosmological models, we find that quasars fail as reliable distance indicators, even when combined with other independent cosmological datasets.

2025-09-10, **Dusty Clump Survival in Supernova Ejecta: Dust-Mediated Growth vs. Crushing by the Reverse Shock**, Sergio Martínez-González et.al., [2509.08887v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08887v1)

 Understanding the interaction of dense, cold ejecta clumps with a fast reverse shock, an instance of the "cloud-crushing" problem, is essential to assess whether core-collapse supernovae act as net dust factories or net dust destroyers. This work assesses whether dusty ejecta clumps are destroyed by the reverse shock or instead cool, condense, and grow in mass under realistic supernova-remnant conditions. Cloud-crushing timescales are computed and compared to radiative cooling timescales, including both gas-phase cooling and dust-induced cooling, for a large grid of clump densities, dust-to-gas mass ratios, and shock velocities. When the dust-to-gas mass ratio exceeds $10^{-3}$, gas-grain collisions become efficient enough that the cooling timescale $t\_{\rm cool}$ falls below the cloud-crushing timescale $t\_{\rm cc}$ over a broad span of clump densities and shock velocities, enabling dusty clumps to survive even fast reverse shocks. For example, at clump densities $\geq 2 \times 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, dust-to-gas mass ratios $\sim 10^{-2}$, and shock velocities up to $2000$ km s$^{-1}$, enhanced gas-grain cooling drives the system into a regime where dusty clumps can gain additional cold mass and increase their dust masses. Strong radiative cooling can shield dust-rich clumps in supernova remnants, enabling a significant fraction of ejecta dust to be injected into the interstellar medium. These results mirror the "growth" regime found in studies of circumgalactic clouds and rapidly cooling shocked stellar winds, implying a larger dust survival in supernova remnants. Indeed, the dusty globules seen in the Crab Nebula occupy the predicted survival regime across a wide range of physical parameters.

2025-09-10, **Characterizing Supernovae Host Galaxies with FrankenBlast: A Scalable Tool for Transient Host Galaxy Association, Photometry, and Stellar Population Modeling**, Anya E. Nugent et.al., [2509.08874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08874v1)

 We present FrankenBlast, a customized and improved version of the Blast web application. FrankenBlast associates transients to their host galaxies, performs host photometry, and runs a innovative SED fitting code to constrain host stellar population properties--all within minutes per object. We test FrankenBlast on 14,432 supernovae (SNe), ~half of which are spectroscopically-classified, and are able to constrain host properties for 9262 events. When contrasting the host stellar masses ($M\_*$), specific star formation rates (sSFR), and host dust extinction ($A\_V$) between spectroscopically and photometrically-classified SNe Ia, Ib/c, II, and IIn, we determine that deviations in these distributions are primarily due to misclassified events contaminating the photometrically-classified sample. We further show that the higher redshifts of the photometrically-classified sample also force their $M\_*$ and sSFR distributions to deviate from those of the spectroscopically-classified sample, as these properties are redshift-dependent. We compare host properties between spectroscopically-classified SN populations and determine if they primarily trace $M\_*$ or SFR. We find that all SN populations seem to both depend on $M\_*$ and SFR, with SNe II and IIn somewhat more SFR-dependent than SNe Ia and Ib/c, and SNe Ia more $M\_*$-dependent than all other classes. We find the difference in the SNe Ib/c and II hosts the most intriguing and speculate that SNe Ib/c must be more dependent on higher $M\_*$ and more evolved environments for the right conditions for progenitor formation. All data products and FrankenBlast are publicly available, along with a developing FrankenBlast version intended for Rubin Observatory science products.

2025-09-10, **Black hole mass function shift in proto-stellar-clusters driven by gas accretion**, Zacharias Roupas et.al., [2509.08448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08448v1)

 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off $<55{\rm M}\_\odot$, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, $\sim 60-130{\rm M}\_\odot$, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range $\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\sim 10^6{\rm M}\_\odot$ and size $\sim 1{\rm pc}$. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as $\sim 10^2-10^3{\rm M}\_\odot$.

2025-09-10, **Gamma radiation from cosmic rays escaping a young supernova remnant: The case of Cas A**, P. Blasi et.al., [2509.08447v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08447v1)

 The escape of accelerated particles from supernova remnants remains one of the central and yet least understood aspects of the origin of cosmic rays. Here we use the results of the recent LHAASO observation of gamma rays from a region of $\sim 2$ degrees around the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant to constrain the process of particle escape from this remnant. We dedicate special attention to discuss the impact of shock evolution and particle propagation in the near source region on the gamma ray emission. This is very important to assess the possibility that very high-energy protons may have been accelerated in past activity of Cas A. Given the core collapse nature of Cas A and its young age ($\sim 340$ years), the non detection of $\gtrsim 100$ TeV gamma rays from this remnant allows us to draw some conclusions on the role of supernova explosions for the origin of cosmic rays at the knee. In particular we calculate the spectrum of cosmic rays that may have escaped this remnant to make a clear distinction between the instantaneous maximum energy and the one that appears as a flux suppression in the time integrated spectrum from an individual supernova. LHAASO observation of the region around Cas A as well as gamma ray observations of the remnant itself confirm that this remnant is not operating as a PeVatron and that, although in the early stages the maximum energy may have reached $\sim$Peta-electronVolt, the number of such particles in the surroundings of Cas A is exceedingly small.

2025-09-10, **Unsupervised machine learning classification of gamma-ray bursts based on the rest-frame prompt emission parameters**, Si-Yuan Zhu et.al., [2509.08224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08224v1)

 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to originate from two distinct progenitors, compact binary mergers and massive collapsars. Traditional and some recent machine learning-based classification schemes predominantly rely on observer-frame physical parameters, which are significantly affected by the redshift effects and may not accurately represent the intrinsic properties of GRBs. In particular, the progenitors usually could only be decided by successful detection of the multi-band long-term afterglow, which could easily cost days of devoted effort from multiple global observational utilities. In this work, we apply the unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms called t-SNE and UMAP to perform GRB classification based on rest-frame prompt emission parameters. The map results of both t-SNE and UMAP reveal a clear division of these GRBs into two clusters, denoted as GRBs-I and GRBs-II. We find that all supernova-associated GRBs, including the atypical short-duration burst GRB 200826A (now recognized as collapsar-origin), consistently fall within the GRBs-II category. Conversely, all kilonova-associated GRBs (except for two controversial events) are classified as GRBs-I, including the peculiar long-duration burst GRB 060614 originating from a merger event. In another words, this clear ML separation of two types of GRBs based only on prompt properties could correctly predict the results of progenitors without follow-up afterglow properties. Comparative analysis with conventional classification methods using $T\_{90}$ and $E\_{\rm p,z}$--$E\_{\rm iso}$ correlation demonstrates that our machine learning approach provides superior discriminative power, particularly in resolving ambiguous cases of hybrid GRBs.
