2024-08-12, **Dissecting Lepton Number Violation in the Left-Right Symmetric Model: $0νββ$ decay, Møller scattering, and collider searches**, Gang Li et.al., [2408.06306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06306v1)

 In the context of the left-right symmetric model, we study the interplay of neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, parity-violating M{\o}ller scattering, and high-energy colliders, resulting from the Yukawa interaction of the right-handed doubly-charged scalar to electrons, which could evade the severe constraints from charged lepton flavor violation. The $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay amplitude receives additional contributions from right-handed sterile neutrinos. The half-life, calculated in the effective field theory (EFT) framework, allows for an improved description of the contributions involving non-zero mixing between left- and right-handed $W$ bosons and those arising from exchanging a light right-handed neutrino. We find that the relative sensitivities between the low-energy (or high-precision) and high-energy experiments are affected by the left-right mixing. On the other hand, our results show how the interplay of collider and low-energy searches provides a manner to explore regions that are inaccessible to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments.

2024-08-12, **Testing for coherence and nonstandard neutrino interactions in COHERENT data**, Jiajun Liao et.al., [2408.06255v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06255v1)

 We analyze data from the CsI, liquid Ar and Ge detectors of the COHERENT experiment and confirm within $1.5\sigma$ that the measured elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section is proportional to the square of the number of neutrons in the nucleus, as expected for coherent scattering in the standard model. We also show how various degeneracies involving nonstandard neutrino interaction parameters are broken in a combined analysis of the three datasets.

2024-08-12, **Logic and numbers related to solar neutrinos**, L. M. Slad et.al., [2408.06041v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06041v1)

 In this work, first of all, we analyze a number of hidden aspects of the concept of particle oscillations. The key element of this concept, which do not comply with the principle of least action, is the notion of a mixture of particles, introduced by Gell-Mann and Pais for neutral $K$-mesons. It has been proven that the law of conservation of energy-momentum in the processes of electron neutrino production does not allow solving the problem of solar neutrinos based on the assumption of Gribov and Pontecorvo about their oscillations. It has been established that the consequences of Wolfenstein's equation contradict the results of the SNO and Super-Kamiokande collaborations and that the assertion by Mikheev and Smirnov on the conversion of solar neutrinos is erroneous. Another part of the work is devoted to a logically clear solution to this problem based on the hypothesis of the existence of a new interaction, the carrier of which is a massless pseudoscalar boson, which has a Yukawa coupling with electron neutrinos and nucleons. At each act of interaction of an electron neutrino with the nucleons of the Sun, caused by such interaction, the handedness of the neutrino changes from left to right and vice versa, and also the neutrino energy decreases. The hypothesis provides good agreement between the theoretical and experimental values of the rates of all five observed processes with solar neutrinos. This serves as a significant criterion for both the confidence of such a solution to the problem of solar neutrinos and the confidence of the existence of a new interaction.

2024-08-12, **Searching for light long-lived particles at SHiNESS**, Zeren Simon Wang et.al., [2408.05995v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05995v1)

 Recently Soleti et al.~[\textit{JHEP03(2024)148}] proposed a new experiment called SHiNESS at the upcoming European Spallation Source (ESS) facility, making use of the 2-GeV proton beam there impinging on a fixed target, in order to search for hidden sterile neutrinos that could lie in different mass ranges and arise with distinct signatures. Such signatures include excesses in electron-positron pairs that may originate from displaced decays of long-lived particles (LLPs).At the ESS, the dominant sources of such LLPs are decays of $\pi^+$ mesons at rest and decays of $\mu^+$ leptons.We choose to investigate theoretical scenarios of long-lived light binos in the R-parity-violating supersymmetry and long-lived weak-violating electrophilic axionlike particles, as these LLPs can be produced from decays of $\pi^+$ and $\mu^+$.Since the $\pi^+$'s decay at rest at the ESS, we compute the spectra of the therefrom produced $\mu^+$'s or LLPs, and thus estimate the expected sensitivity reach of SHiNESS to the LLPs in these two scenarios.Our calculation shows that in most of the relevant benchmark scenarios, SHiNESS can probe large parameter regions of these models beyond the existing bounds, in just a couple of years of data-collection time.

2024-08-12, **A minimal neutrino oscillation affected QCD axion model**, Zhen-Yu Lei et.al., [2408.05903v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05903v1)

 Combining the KSVZ axion model and the type-I seesaw mechanism, we construct a minimal axion model that may affect the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation. This minimal model requires flavor mixed axion-neutrinos interactions and two additional standard model (SM) singlet scalars which generate specific patterns of lepton mass matrices. These patterns yield a particular texture of Majorana neutrino mass matrix. We find that this texture, combined with existing neutrino experimental data, predicts an Inverted Hierarchy of neutrino masses with $17\lesssim m\_1/m\_3\lesssim 44$, and a hierarchy between the two VEVs of SM-singlet scalars. Finally, we examine the potential effect of this model on neutrino oscillation phenomena.

2024-08-12, **Density Distribution of Plasmas Resembling Dark Matter Halo Due to Ionization lag and Ambipolar Electric Field**, Haibin Chen et.al., [2408.06301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06301v1)

 In a spherically symmetric plasma constrained by its own gravity, the ionization degree lags behind changes in temperature and density. The ambipolar electric field accelerates ions radially and cools electrons. Ions lose energy and angular momentum in collisions with low-temperature electrons. The angular momentum of ions decreases much faster than their energy in cycles. The trajectories of ions are close to radial, and the density distribution resembles pseudo-isothermal.   The velocity distributions of baryons moving outward and inward in galaxies tend to approach independent Maxwell distributions. This characteristic suppresses small-angle scattering of ions, reducing the ion collision cross-section by three orders of magnitude. In the massive galaxies, baryons can replace all dark matter.

2024-08-12, **On the KG-constrained general disformal transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action**, Allan L. Alinea et.al., [2408.06176v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06176v1)

 Although with great successes in explaining phenomena and natural behaviour involving the Universe or a part thereof, the General Theory of Relativity is far from a complete theory. There are plenty of avenues to investigate its extensions or generalisations that, in the future, could pave the way for a much deeper understanding and possibly solutions of current problems involving the Universe; e.g., dark matter, dark energy, fine-tuning, etc. Focusing on its extension within the framework of scalar tensor theory, we investigate the transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action under the general disformal transformation coupled with set of triple KG constraints. The idea is that the general disformal transformation leads to an extremely complicated action necessitating a set of constraints to tame the resulting form. Motivated by previous studies on the invertibility and invariance of the massless Klein-Gordon equation under the general disformal transformation, we identify three constraints that significantly simplifies the transformed Einstein-Hilbert action. In four spacetime dimensions, we find that the transformed action is a sum of the original action and a disformal contribution involving a six-term Lagrangian that includes the Ricci tensor coupled to a sum of derivatives of scalar fields and kinetic terms. In three spacetime dimensions, the disformal contribution becomes a five-term Lagrangian. Lastly, in two spacetime dimensions, the Einstein-Hilbert action is invariant under the constrained disformal transformation.

2024-08-12, **Infant Type Ia Supernovae from the KMTNet I. Multi-Color Evolution and Populations**, Yuan Qi Ni et.al., [2408.06287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06287v1)

 We conduct a systematic analysis of the early multi-band light curves and colors of 19 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network SN Program, including 16 previously unpublished events. Seven are detected $\lesssim$ 1 day since the estimated epoch of first light and the rest within $\lesssim$ 3 days. Some show excess emission within $<$ 0.5 days to $\sim$ 2 days, but most show pure power-law rises. The colors are initially diverse before $\sim$ 5 days, but converge to a similar color at $\sim$ 10 days. We identify at least three populations based on 2--5-day color evolution: (1) "early-blues" exhibit slowly-evolving colors consistent with a $\sim$ 17,000 K blackbody; (2) "early-reds" have initially blue $B-V$ and red $V-i$ colors that cannot simultaneously be fit with a blackbody -- likely due to suppression of $B$- and $i$-band flux by Fe II/III and Ca II -- and evolve more rapidly; and (3) "early-yellows" evolve blueward, consistent with thermal heating from $\sim$ 8,000 to 13,000 K. The distributions of early-blue and early-red colors are compatible with them being either distinct populations -- with early-reds comprising (60 $\pm$ 15)% of them -- or extreme ends of one continuous population; whereas the early-yellow population identified here is clearly distinct. Compared to the other populations, early-blues in our sample differ by exhibiting excess emission within 1--2 days, nearly constant peak brightness regardless of $\Delta M\_{15}(B)$ after standardization, and shallower Si II features. Early-blues also prefer star-forming host environments, while early-yellows and, to a lesser extent, early-reds prefer quiescent ones. These preferences appear to indicate at least two Type Ia SN production channels based on stellar population age, while early-reds and early-blues may still share a common origin.

2024-08-12, **Status Report on the Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program (CCHP): Three Independent Astrophysical Determinations of the Hubble Constant Using the James Webb Space Telescope**, Wendy L. Freedman et.al., [2408.06153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06153v1)

 We present the latest results from the Chicago Carnegie Hubble Program (CCHP) to measure the Hubble constant using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This program is based upon three independent methods: (1) Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) stars, (2) JAGB (J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch) stars, and (3) Cepheids. Our program includes 10 nearby galaxies, each hosting Type Ia supernovae, suitable for measuring the Hubble constant (Ho). It also includes NGC 4258, which has a geometric distance, setting the zero point for all three methods. The JWST observations have significantly higher signal-to-noise and finer angular resolution than previous observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We find three independent values of Ho = 69.85 +/- 1.75 (stat) +/- 1.54 (sys) for the TRGB, Ho = 67.96 +/- 1.85 (stat) +/- 1.90 (sys) for the JAGB, and Ho = 72.05 +/- 1.86 (stat) +/- 3.10 (sys) km/s/Mpc for Cepheids. Tying into supernovae, and combining these methods adopting a flat prior, yields our current estimate of Ho = 69.96 +/- 1.05 (stat) +/- 1.12 (sys) km/s/Mpc. The distances measured using the TRGB and the JAGB method agree at the 1% level, but differ from the Cepheid distances at the 2.5-4% level. The value of Ho based on these two methods with JWST data alone is Ho = 69.03 +/- 1.75 (total error) km/sec/Mpc. These numbers are consistent with the current standard Lambda CDM model, without the need for the inclusion of additional new physics. Future JWST data will be required to increase the precision and accuracy of the local distance scale.
