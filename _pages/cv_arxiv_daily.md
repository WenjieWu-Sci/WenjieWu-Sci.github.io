2023-06-13, **Interplay between non-interfering neutrino exchange mechanisms and nuclear matrix elements in $0νββ$ decay**, Eligio Lisi et.al., [2306.07671v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07671v1)

 We revisit the phenomenology of neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay mediated by non-interfering exchange of light and heavy Majorana neutrinos, in the context of current and prospective ton-scale experimental searches, as well as of recent calculations of nuclear matrix elements (NME) in different nuclear models. We derive joint upper bounds on the light and heavy contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, for different sets of NME, through separate and combined data coming from the following experiments (and isotopes): KamLAND-Zen and EXO (Xe), GERDA, and MAJORANA (Ge) and CUORE (Te). We further consider three proposed projects that could provide, within current bounds, possible $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay signals at $>\!3\sigma$ level with an exposure of 10 ton years: nEXO (Xe), LEGEND (Ge) and CUPID (Mo). Separate and combined (Xe, Ge, Mo) signals are studied for different representative cases and NME sets, and the conditions leading to (non)degenerate light and heavy neutrino mechanisms are discussed. In particular, the role of heavy-to-light NME ratios in different isotopes is highlighted through appropriate graphical representations. By using different sets of ``true'' and ``test'' NME as a proxy for nuclear uncertainties, it is shown that the relative contributions of light and heavy neutrino exchange to $0\nu\beta\beta$ signals may be significantly biased in some cases. Implications for theoretical models connecting light and heavy Majorana neutrino masses are also briefly illustrated. These results provide further motivations to improve NME calculations, so as to better exploit the physics potential of future multi-isotope $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches at the ton scale.

2023-06-13, **R-process beta-decay neutrino flux from binary neutron star merger and collapsar**, Yu An et.al., [2306.07659v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07659v1)

 This study investigates the antineutrinos production by $\beta$-decay of $r$-process nuclei in two astrophysical sites that are capable of producing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) and collapsars, which are promising sites for heavy element nucleosynthesis. We employ a simplified method to compute the $\beta$-decay $\bar\nu\_e$ energy spectrum and consider two representative thermodynamic trajectories for $r$-process simulations, each with four sets of $Y\_e$ distribution. The time evolution of the $\bar\nu\_e$ spectrum is derived for both the dynamical ejecta and the disk wind for BNSMs and collapsar outflow, based on approximated mass outflow rates. Our results show that the $\bar\nu\_e$ has an average energy of approximately 3 to 9~MeV, with a high energy tail of up to 20 MeV. The $\bar\nu\_e$ flux evolution is primarily determined by the outflow duration, and can thus remain large for $\mathcal{O}(10)$~s and $\mathcal{O}(100)$~s for BNSMs and collapsars, respectively. For a single merger or collapsar at 40~Mpc, the $\bar\nu\_e$ flux is $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$, indicating a possible detection horizon up to $0.1-1$~Mpc for Hyper-kamiokande. We also estimate their contributions to the diffuse $\bar\nu\_e$ background. Our results suggest that although the flux from BNSMs is roughly 4--5 orders of magnitude lower than that from the regular core-collapse supernovae, those from collapsars can possibly contribute a non-negligible fraction to the total diffuse $\bar\nu\_e$ flux at energy $\lesssim 1$~MeV, with a large uncertainty depending on the unknown rate of collapsars capable of hosting the $r$-process.

2023-06-13, **Post-inflationary Contamination of Local Primordial Non-Gaussianity in Galaxy Power Spectra**, Charuhas Shiveshwarkar et.al., [2306.07517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07517v1)

 The scale-dependent bias of galaxy density contrasts is an important signal to be extracted in constraining local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f\_{\rm NL}^{\text{local}}$) from observations of large-scale structure. Constraints so obtained rely on the assumption that horizon-scale features in the galaxy power spectrum are exclusively due to primordial physical mechanisms. Yet, post-inflationary effects can induce modulations to the galaxy number density that appear as horizon-scale, scale-dependent bias. We investigate the effect of two such sources of scale-dependent bias - the free-streaming of light relics and fluctuations in the background of ionising radiation - on precision measurements of local primordial non-Gaussianity $f\_{\rm NL}^{\text{local}}$ from galaxy power spectrum measurements. Using the SPHEREx survey as a test case survey reaching $\sigma(f\_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}) \lesssim 1$, we show that ignoring the scale-dependent bias induced by free-streaming particles can negatively bias the inferred value of $f\_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}$ by $\sim 0.1-0.3\sigma$. Ignoring the effect of ionising radiation fluctuations can negatively bias the inferred value of $f\_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}$ by $ \sim 1\sigma$. The range of biases depends on the source populations and the ranges of scales used in the analysis, as well as the value of the neutrino mass and the modelling of the impact of ionising radiation. If these sources of scale-dependent bias are included in the analysis, forecasts for $f\_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}$ are unbiased but degraded.

2023-06-12, **Sensitivity potential to a light flavor-changing scalar boson with DUNE and NA64$μ$**, B. Radics et.al., [2306.07405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07405v1)

 In this work, we report on the sensitivity potential of complementary muon-on-target experiments to new physics using a scalar boson benchmark model associated with charged lepton flavor violation. The NA64$\mu$ experiment at CERN uses a 160-GeV energy muon beam with an active target to search for excess events with missing energy and momentum as a probe of new physics. At the same time, the proton beam at Fermilab, which is used to produce the neutrino beam for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will also produce a high-intensity muon beam dumped in an absorber. Combined with the liquid Argon Near Detector, the system could be used to search for similar scalar boson particles with a lower energy but higher intensity beam. We find that both NA64$\mu$ and DUNE could cover new, unexplored parts of the parameter space of the same benchmark model, providing a complementary way to search for new physics.

2023-06-12, **Neutrino oscillation measurements with JUNO in the presence of scalar NSI**, Aman Gupta et.al., [2306.07343v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07343v1)

 Determination of neutrino mass ordering and precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters are the foremost goals of the JUNO experiment. Here, we explore the capability of JUNO experiment to constrain the scalar non-standard interactions (sNSI). sNSI appears as a correction to the neutrino mass term in the Hamiltonian. Our results show that JUNO can put very stringent constraints on sNSI, particularly for the case of inverted mass ordering. We also check JUNO's capability to determine mass ordering in the presence of sNSI and conclude that the possibility to confuse normal (inverted) mass ordering in the standard scenario (when there is no sNSI) with inverted (normal) ordering in the presence of sNSI exists only at the $3\sigma$ confidence level and above. Finally, we also comment on the precision measurements of $\sin^2\theta\_{12}$, $\Delta m^2\_{21}$ and $\Delta m^2\_{31}$ in the presence of sNSI. We find that the $1\sigma$-allowed uncertainty in each of these oscillation parameters depends on the choice of mass ordering, sNSI and $\rm m\_{lightest}$, wherein a deterioration from a few percent in the case of standard interactions to $\sim13\%$ in the case of sNSI is possible.

2023-06-12, **Cosmic string gravitational waves from global $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking as a probe of the type I seesaw scale**, Bowen Fu et.al., [2306.07334v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07334v1)

 In type I seesaw models, the right-handed neutrinos are typically super-heavy, consistent with the generation of baryon asymmetry via standard leptogenesis. Primordial gravitational waves of cosmological origin provides a new window to probe high scale physics, which would otherwise be inaccessible. By considering a {\em global} $U(1)\_{B-L}$ extension of the type I seesaw model, we explore the connection between neutrino mass and primordial gravitational waves arising from the dynamics of global cosmic string network. As a concrete example, we study a global $U(1)\_{B-L}$ extension of the Littlest Seesaw model and show that the inevitable GW signals, if detectable, probe the parameter space that can accommodate neutrino oscillation data and successful leptogenesis, while respecting theoretical constraints like perturbativity of the theory. Including CMB constraints from polarization and dark radiation leaves a large regions of parameter space of the model, including the best fit regions, which can be probed by GW detectors like LISA and ET in the near future. In general, the GW detectors can test high scale type I seesaw models with the heaviest right-handed neutrino mass above $2.5 \times 10^{14}$ GeV, assuming the perturbativity, and $7 \times 10^{13}$ GeV assuming that the coupling between the heaviest right-handed neutrino and the $U(1)\_{B-L}$ breaking scalar is less than unity.

2023-06-12, **Heavy Neutral Leptons from Stopped Muons and Pions**, Yohei Ema et.al., [2306.07315v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07315v1)

 Stopped muons, which are generic in pion-at-rest experiments, can shed light on heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) in unexplored parameter spaces. If the HNL is lighter than the muon, the HNL can be produced from decays of muons and pions.The HNL will travel from the production location and decay into visible Standard Model (SM) modes, leaving signals inside downstream detectors. We find that in the case that the HNL dominantly mixes with muon neutrinos, the LSND constraint on the mixing angle squared is stronger than all the previous constraints by more than an order of magnitude. In this study, we recast the LSND measurement of the $\nu-e$ scattering. Future experiments such as PIP2-BD could further improve the sensitivity, provided they can distinguish the HNL events from backgrounds induced by the SM neutrinos.

2023-06-12, **Rapid Analysis of $\mathrm{^{226}Ra}$ in Ultrapure Gadolinium Sulfate Octahydrate**, Y. Sakakieda et.al., [2306.06926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06926v1)

 Numerous particle physics experiments utilize gadolinium (Gd), a rare earth element with the most significant neutron capture cross-section among all elements, to detect anti-neutrinos via inverse beta-decays or to remove neutron-induced background events. For example, to load Gd into water Cherenkov detectors, $\mathrm{{Gd\_{2}(SO\_{4})\_{3}\cdot 8H\_{2}O}}$ is dissolved and rare event search experiments are required to screen for radioactive impurities in $\mathrm{{Gd\_{2}(SO\_{4})\_{3}\cdot 8H\_{2}O}}$ before dissolution. This study developed a new method to rapidly measure the radium-226($\mathrm{^{226}Ra}$) concentration in $\mathrm{{Gd\_{2}(SO\_{4})\_{3}\cdot 8H\_{2}O}}$. This method requires only three days to measure a batch of samples, as opposed to the usual method using high-purity germanium detectors, which takes approximately 20 days after arrival. The detection limit for the measurement of $\mathrm{^{226}Ra}$ is 0.32 mBq/kg. This method has been already used for $\mathrm{{Gd\_{2}(SO\_{4})\_{3}\cdot 8H\_{2}O}}$ screening at the Super-Kamiokande Gd(SK-Gd) project, and it can be applied to future experiments.

2023-06-12, **Probing top quark anomalous moments in $W$ boson associated single top quark production at the LHC using polarization and spin correlation**, Rafiqul Rahaman et.al., [2306.06889v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06889v1)

 We study the $W$ boson associated single top quark production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to probe anomalous chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric moments of the top quark with the help of polarization and spin correlation observables besides the cross-section in the leptonic final state. We reconstruct the two neutrinos in the final state using the $M\_{T2}$ assisted on-shell (MAOS) reconstruction method to measure the polarization and spin correlation asymmetries of the top quark and the $W$ boson. We estimate the limits on the anomalous moments in a detector-level simulation considering possible backgrounds for a few sets of integrated luminosities and examined the effect of systematic uncertainties.

2023-06-13, **Pseudo-Goldstone dark matter in a radiative inverse seesaw scenario**, Kristjan Kannike et.al., [2306.07865v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07865v1)

 We consider a scale-invariant inverse seesaw model with dynamical breaking of gauge symmetry and lepton number. In some regions of the parameter space, the Majoron - the pseudo-Goldstone of lepton number breaking - is a viable dark matter candidate. The bound on the Majoron decay rate implies a very large dilaton VEV, which also results in a suppression of other DM couplings. Because of that, the observed dark matter relic abundance can only be matched via the freeze-in mechanism. Another scalar field among the ones included in the model can play the role of the inflaton, predicting a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.007$ for metric inflation and $r \lesssim 0.16$ for Palatini gravity.

2023-06-13, **Impact of Dynamical Friction on the Tidal Formation of NGC 1052-DF2**, Ryosuke Katayama et.al., [2306.07756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07756v1)

 If a normal dwarf satellite galaxy repeatedly suffers from strong tidal forces while orbiting a massive halo, it can turn into a dark matter-deficient galaxy (DMDG). It has been shown that NGC 1052-DF2 can form due to this tidal scenario by N-body simulation; however, the dynamical friction has been ignored in the literature. We perform a self-consistent full N-body simulation to investigate the effect of dynamical friction on the formation scenario and compare it with the one without dynamical friction. We find that dynamical friction causes a dramatic decay of the satellite's orbit. This makes the orbital period shorter, and the mass of the satellite decreases more rapidly. As a result, the satellite galaxy suffering from dynamical friction becomes a DMDG in $\approx 7-8$ Gyr, which is $\approx 2-3$ Gyr earlier than that in the simulation without dynamical friction. Although the distribution of the globular clusters (GCs) in our simulation does not fully agree with that of DF2, the current observations still have large uncertainties. Our result implies that DF2 can be formed by a more circular orbit within a Hubble time, and that DMDGs can be formed by this tidal scenario more often than previously thought.

2023-06-13, **Forbidden dark matter annihilation into leptons with full collision terms**, Amin Aboubrahim et.al., [2306.07753v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07753v1)

 The standard approach of calculating the relic density of thermally produced dark matter based on the assumption of kinetic equilibrium is known to fail for forbidden dark matter models since only the high momentum tail of the dark matter phase space distribution function contributes significantly to dark matter annihilations. Furthermore, it is known that the computationally less expensive Fokker-Planck approximation for the collision term describing elastic scattering processes between non-relativistic dark matter particles and the Standard Model thermal bath breaks down if both scattering partners are close in mass. This, however, is the defining feature of the forbidden dark matter paradigm. In this paper, we therefore include the full elastic collision term in the full momentum-dependent Boltzmann equation as well as in a set of fluid equations that couple the evolution of the number density and dark matter temperature for a simplified model featuring forbidden dark matter annihilations into muon or tau leptons through a scalar mediator. On the technical side, we perform all angular integrals in the full collision term analytically and take into account the effect of dark matter self-interactions on the relic density. The overall phenomenological outcome is that the updated relic density calculation results in a significant reduction of the experimentally allowed parameter space compared to the traditional approach, which solves only for the abundance. In addition, almost the entire currently viable parameter space can be probed with CMB-S4, next-generation beam-dump experiments or at a future high-luminosity electron-position collider, except for the resonant region where the mediator corresponds to approximately twice the muon or tau mass.

2023-06-12, **Closing the Gap between Observed Low-Mass Galaxy HI Kinematics and CDM Predictions**, Amy Sardone et.al., [2306.07417v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07417v1)

 Testing the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) at small scales is challenging. Galaxies that inhabit low-mass dark matter halos provide an ideal test bed for dark matter models by linking observational properties of galaxies at small scales (low mass, low velocity) to low-mass dark matter halos. However, the observed kinematics of these galaxies do not align with the kinematics of the dark matter halos predicted to host them, obscuring our understanding of the low-mass end of the galaxy-halo connection. We use deep HI observations of low-mass galaxies at high spectral resolution in combination with cosmological simulations of dwarf galaxies to better understand the connection between dwarf galaxy kinematics and low-mass halos. Specifically, we use HI line widths to directly compare to the maximum velocities in a dark matter halo, and find that each deeper measurement approaches the expected one-to-one relationship between the observed kinematics and the predicted kinematics in $\Lambda$CDM. We also measure baryonic masses and place these on the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). Again, our deepest measurements approach the theoretical predictions for the low-mass end of this relation, a significant improvement on similar measurements based on line widths measured at 50\% and 20\% of the peak. Our data also hints at the rollover in the BTFR predicted by hydrodynamical simulations of $\Lambda$CDM for low-mass galaxies.

2023-06-12, **A Global Semi-Analytic Model of the First Stars and Galaxies Including Dark Matter Halo Merger Histories**, Colton R. Feathers et.al., [2306.07371v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07371v1)

 We present a new self-consistent semi-analytic model of the first stars and galaxies to explore the high-redshift ($z{>}15$) Population III (PopIII) and metal-enriched star formation histories. Our model includes the detailed merger history of dark matter halos generated with Monte Carlo merger trees. We calibrate the minimum halo mass for PopIII star formation from recent hydrodynamical cosmological simulations that simultaneously include the baryon-dark matter streaming velocity, Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, and molecular hydrogen self-shielding. We find that the resulting star formation rate density (SFRD) is dramatically increased compared to calibrations based on previous simulations (e.g., the PopIII SFRD is over two orders of magnitude higher at $z{\gtrsim}22.5$). We evaluate the effect of the halo-to-halo scatter in this critical mass and find that it increases the PopIII stellar mass density by a factor of ${\sim}1.5$ at $z{>}15$. Additionally, we assess the impact of various semi-analytic/analytic prescriptions for halo assembly and star formation previously adopted in the literature. For example, we find that models assuming smooth halo growth computed via abundance matching predict SFRDs similar to the merger tree model for our fiducial model parameters, but that they may underestimate the PopIII SFRD in cases of strong LW feedback. Finally, we simulate sub-volumes of the Universe with our model both to quantify the reduction in total star formation in numerical simulations due to a lack of density fluctuations on spatial scales larger than the simulation box, and to determine spatial fluctuations in SFRD due to the diversity in halo abundances and merger histories.

2023-06-12, **Dark Matter Is The New BBN**, Dan Hooper et.al., [2306.07339v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07339v1)

 Measurements of the primordial element abundances provide us with an important probe of our universe's early thermal history, allowing us to constrain the expansion rate and composition of our universe as early as $\sim 1 \, {\rm s}$ after the Big Bang. Prior to this time, we have essentially no empirical information on which to base any such claims. In this paper, we imagine a future time in which we have not only detected the particles that make up the dark matter, but have measured their mass and annihilation cross section with reasonable precision. In analogy to the light element abundances, the dark matter abundance in this scenario could be used to study and constrain the expansion rate and composition of our universe at the time of dark matter freeze out, which for a standard thermal relic occurs at $T\_f \sim 20/m\_{\chi}$, corresponding to $t \sim 4 \times 10^{-10} \, {\rm s} \times ({\rm TeV}/m\_{\chi})^2$, many orders of magnitude prior to the onset of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. As examples, we consider how such measurements could be used to constrain scenarios which feature exotic forms of radiation or matter, a ultralight scalar, or modifications to gravity, each of which have the potential to be much more powerfully probed with dark matter than with the light element abundances.

2023-06-12, **New method to revisit the gravitational lensing analysis of the Bullet Cluster using radio waves**, Youngsub Yoon et.al., [2306.07157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07157v1)

 Gravitational lensing studies of the Bullet Cluster suggested convincingly in favor of the existence of dark matter. However, it was performed without the knowledge of the original orientation of each galaxy before gravitational lensing. A potential improvement to this issue lies in the measurement of the original orientation from the polarization direction of radio waves emitted from each galaxy. In this context, Francfort et al. derived a formula that can utilize the information about the original orientation of each galaxy to obtain what is called ${\it shear}$. However, we demonstrate that shear in their formula should be replaced by ${\it reduced~shear}$ when the change in sizes of images of galaxies is taken into account. As the previous gravitational lensing analysis of the Bullet Cluster used reduced shear, we suggest applying our improved formula directly for the reanalysis once we obtain the polarization direction of radio waves. In particular, we show that our new formula can yield a more accurate analysis than the previous one, if the polarization direction can be measured more precisely than $10^\circ$.

2023-06-12, **CP-violating axion interactions II: axions as Dark Matter**, Vaisakh Plakkot et.al., [2306.07065v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07065v1)

 Axions provide a solution to the strong CP problem and are excellent dark matter candidates. The presence of additional sources of CP violation, for example to account for the matter/antimatter asymmetry of the universe, can lead to CP-violating interactions between axions and Standard Model fields. In case axions form a coherent dark matter background, this leads to time-oscillating fundamental constants such as the fine-structure constant and particle masses. In this work we compare the sensitivity of various searches for CP-odd axion interactions. These include fifth-force experiments, searches for time-oscillating constants induced by axion dark matter, and direct limits from electric dipole moment experiments. We show that searches for oscillating constants can outperform fifth-force experiments in the regime of small axion masses, but, in general, do not reach the sensitivity of electric dipole moment experiments.

2023-06-12, **Electron and Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM**, Junjie Cao et.al., [2306.06854v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06854v1)

 Inspired by the recent measurements of the muon and electron anomalous magnetic moments, the rapid progress of the LHC search for supersymmetry, and the significantly improved sensitivities of dark matter direct detection experiments, we studied the supersymmetric contribution to the electron \texorpdfstring{$g-2$}{}, $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}$, in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with a discrete $\mathbb{Z}\_3$ symmetry. We concluded that $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}$ was mainly correlated with $a\_\mu^{\rm SUSY}$ by the formula $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}/m\_e^2 \simeq a\_\mu^{\rm SUSY}/m\_\mu^2$, and significant violations of this correlation might occur only in rare cases. As a result, $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}$ was typically around $5 \times 10^{-14}$ when $a\_\mu^{\rm SUSY} \simeq 2.5 \times 10^{-9}$. We also concluded that the dark matter direct detection and LHC experiments played crucial roles in determining the maximum reach of $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}$. Concretely, $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}$ might be around $3 \times 10^{-13}$ in the optimum cases if one used the XENON-1T experiment to limit the supersymmetry parameter space. This prediction, however, was reduced to $1.5 \times 10^{-13}$ after implementing the LZ restrictions and $1.0 \times 10^{-13}$ when further considering the LHC restrictions.

2023-06-13, **Multi-Epoch Machine Learning 2: Identifying physical drivers of galaxy properties in simulations**, Robert McGibbon et.al., [2306.07728v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07728v1)

 Using a novel machine learning method, we investigate the buildup of galaxy properties in different simulations, and in various environments within a single simulation. The aim of this work is to show the power of this approach at identifying the physical drivers of galaxy properties within simulations. We compare how the stellar mass is dependent on the value of other galaxy and halo properties at different points in time by examining the feature importance values of a machine learning model. By training the model on IllustrisTNG we show that stars are produced at earlier times in higher density regions of the universe than they are in low density regions. We also apply the technique to the Illustris, EAGLE, and CAMELS simulations. We find that stellar mass is built up in a similar way in EAGLE and IllustrisTNG, but significantly differently in the original Illustris, suggesting that subgrid model physics is more important than the choice of hydrodynamics method. These differences are driven by the efficiency of supernova feedback. Applying principal component analysis to the CAMELS simulations allows us to identify a component associated with the importance of a halo's gravitational potential and another component representing the time at which galaxies form. We discover that the speed of galactic winds is a more critical subgrid parameter than the total energy per unit star formation. Finally we find that the Simba black hole feedback model has a larger effect on galaxy formation than the IllustrisTNG black hole feedback model.

2023-06-13, **Sciences for The 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST)**, WFST Collaboration et.al., [2306.07590v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07590v1)

 The Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is a dedicated photometric survey facility under construction jointly by the University of Science and Technology of China and Purple Mountain Observatory. It is equipped with a primary mirror of 2.5m in diameter, an active optical system, and a mosaic CCD camera of 0.73 Gpix on the main focus plane to achieve high-quality imaging over a field of view of 6.5 square degrees. The installation of WFST in the Lenghu observing site is planned to happen in the summer of 2023, and the operation is scheduled to commence within three months afterward. WFST will scan the northern sky in four optical bands (u, g, r, and i) at cadences from hourly/daily to semi-weekly in the deep high-cadence survey (DHS) and the wide field survey (WFS) programs, respectively. WFS reaches a depth of 22.27, 23.32, 22.84, and 22.31 in AB magnitudes in a nominal 30-second exposure in the four bands during a photometric night, respectively, enabling us to search tremendous amount of transients in the low-z universe and systematically investigate the variability of Galactic and extragalactic objects. Intranight 90s exposures as deep as 23 and 24 mag in u and g bands via DHS provide a unique opportunity to facilitate explorations of energetic transients in demand for high sensitivity, including the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational-wave events detected by the second/third-generation GW detectors, supernovae within a few hours of their explosions, tidal disruption events and luminous fast optical transients even beyond a redshift of 1. Meanwhile, the final 6-year co-added images, anticipated to reach g about 25.5 mag in WFS or even deeper by 1.5 mag in DHS, will be of significant value to general Galactic and extragalactic sciences. The highly uniform legacy surveys of WFST will also serve as an indispensable complement to those of LSST which monitors the southern sky.

2023-06-12, **The Progenitors of Superluminous Type Ia Supernovae**, Margot Fitz Axen et.al., [2306.07430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07430v1)

 Recent observations of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have discovered a subclass of 'super-Chandrasekhar' SNe Ia (SC SNe Ia) whose high luminosities and low ejecta velocities suggest that they originate from the explosions of white dwarfs (WDs) with masses that exceed the Chandrasekhar mass limit. Different models have been proposed to explain the progenitors of these explosions, including a 'magnetized WD' model and a 'WD merger' model. To test the robustness of these models, we conduct a 1D numerical parameter survey of WD explosions using these models as initial conditions. We follow the explosions using the hydrodynamics code Castro and then use the radiation transport code SuperNu to create light curves and spectra for the models. We find that while both classes of models fall within the range of SC SNe Ia observations on the light curve width-luminosity relation, only the WD merger models reproduce the observed low ejecta velocities. The light curves of our merger models are more similar photometrically to observations than our magnetized models. Given this, we discuss possible explanations for the brightest SC SNe Ia observations that cannot be reproduced with our WD merger models. This study provides the basis for future SC SNe Ia observations and higher-dimensional numerical models.

2023-06-12, **Hard X-ray observation and multiwavelength study of the PeVatron candidate pulsar wind nebula "Dragonfly"**, Jooyun Woo et.al., [2306.07347v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07347v1)

 We studied the PeVatron nature of the pulsar wind nebula G75.2+0.1 ("Dragonfly") as part of our NuSTAR observational campaign of energetic PWNe. The Dragonfly is spatially coincident with LHAASO J2018+3651 whose maximum photon energy is 0.27 PeV. We detected a compact (radius 1') inner nebula of the Dragonfly without a spectral break in 3 $-$ 20 keV using NuSTAR. A joint analysis of the inner nebula with the archival Chandra and XMM-Newton observations yields a power-law spectrum with $\Gamma=1.49\pm0.03$. Synchrotron burnoff is observed from the shrinkage of the NuSTAR nebula at higher energies, from which we infer the magnetic field in the inner nebula of 24 $\mu$G at 3.5 kpc. Our analysis of archival XMM data and 13 years of Fermi-LAT data confirms the detection of an extended (~10') outer nebula in 2 $-$ 6 keV ($\Gamma=1.82\pm0.03$) and non-detection of a GeV nebula, respectively. Using the VLA, XMM, and HAWC data, we modeled a multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution of the Dragonfly as a leptonic PeVatron. The maximum injected particle energy of 1.4 PeV from our model suggests that the Dragonfly is likely a PeVatron. Our model prediction of the low magnetic field (2.7 $\mu$G) in the outer nebula and recent interaction with the host supernova remnant's reverse shock (4 kyrs ago) align with common features of PeVatron PWNe. The origin of its highly asymmetric morphology, pulsar proper motion, PWN-SNR interaction, and source distance will require further investigations in the future including a multi-wavelength study using radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations.

 Recent JWST observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2021aefx in the nebular phase have paved the way for late-time studies covering the full optical to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength range, and with it the hope to better constrain SN Ia explosion mechanisms. We investigate whether public SN Ia models covering a broad range of progenitor scenarios and explosion mechanisms can reproduce the full optical-MIR spectrum of SN 2021aefx at $\sim$270 days post explosion. We perform 1D steady-state non-LTE simulations with the radiative-transfer code CMFGEN, and compare the predicted spectra to SN 2021aefx. The models can explain the main features of SN 2021aefx over the full wavelength range. However, no single model, or mechanism, emerges as a preferred match. We discuss possible causes for the mismatch of the models, including ejecta asymmetries and ionisation effects. Our new calculations of the collisional strengths for Ni III have a major impact on the two prominent lines at 7.35 and 11.00 $\mu$m, and highlight the need for more accurate collisional data for forbidden transitions. Using updated atomic data, we identify a strong feature due to [Ca IV] 3.21 $\mu$m, attributed to [Ni I] in previous studies. We also provide a tentative identification of a forbidden line due to [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m, whose peaked profile suggests that neon is mixed inwards during the explosion, as predicted for instance in violent merger models. Contrary to previous claims, we show that the [Ar III] 8.99 $\mu$m line can be broader in sub-$M\_\mathrm{Ch}$ models compared to near-$M\_\mathrm{Ch}$ models. Our models suggest that key physical ingredients are missing from either the explosion models, or the radiative-transfer post-processing, or both. Nonetheless, they also show the potential of the near- and mid-infrared to uncover new spectroscopic diagnostics of SN Ia explosion mechanisms. [Abridged]

2023-06-12, **Double neutron star formation via consecutive type II supernova explosions**, Viktória Fröhlich et.al., [2306.07099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07099v1)

 Since the discovery of the first double neutron star (DNS) system, the number of these exotic binaries has reached fifteen. Here we investigate a channel of DNS formation in binary systems with components above the mass limit of type II supernova explosion (SN II), i.e. 8 MSun. We apply a spherically symmetric homologous envelope expansion model to account for mass loss, and follow the dynamical evolution of the system numerically with a high-precision integrator. The first SN occurs in a binary system whose orbital parameters are pre-defined, then, the homologous expansion model is applied again in the newly formed system. Analysing 1 658 880 models we find that DNS formation via subsequent SN II explosions requires a fine-tuning of the initial parameters. Our model can explain DNS systems with a separation greater than 2.95 au. The eccentricity of the DNS systems spans a wide range thanks to the orbital circularisation effect due to the second SN II explosion. The eccentricity of the DNS is sensitive to the initial eccentricity of the binary progenitor and the orbital position of the system preceding the second explosion. In agreement with the majority of the observations of DNS systems, we find the system centre-of mass velocities to be less than 60 km/s. Neutron stars that become unbound in either explosion gain a peculiar velocity in the range of 0.02 - 240 km/s. In our model, the formation of tight DNS systems requires a post-explosion orbit-shrinking mechanism, possibly driven by the ejected envelopes.

2023-06-12, **On the occurrence of stellar fission in binary-driven hypernovae**, S. R. Zhang et.al., [2306.07097v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07097v1)

 The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model address long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated with type Ic supernovae (SNe) through a series of physical episodes that occur in a binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star (of mass about 10 solar mass) and a neutron star (NS) companion (of mass about 2 solar mass) in a compact orbit. The SN explosion of the CO star triggers sequence of seven events. The BdHN model has followed the traditional picture of the SN from the CO iron's core collapse. However, the lack of a solution to the problem of producing successful SNe leaves room for alternative scenarios. We here show that tidal synchronization of the CO-NS binary can lead the CO star to critical conditions for fission, hence splitting into two stellar remnants, e.g., about 8.5 solar mass + 1.5 solar mass. We give specific examples of the properties of the products for various orbital periods relevant to BdHNe. The astrophysical consequences of this scenario are outlined.

2023-06-12, **Transition from small-scale to large-scale dynamo in a supernova-driven, multiphase medium**, Frederick A. Gent et.al., [2306.07051v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07051v1)

 Magnetic fields are now widely recognised as critical at many scales to galactic dynamics and structure, including multiphase pressure balance, dust processing, and star formation. Models that impose galactic magnetic fields cannot reliably capture their dynamical structure nor interactions with phases within the interstellar medium (ISM). Dynamos must be modelled to create such magnetic fields. ISM models exist in which a small-scale dynamo (SSD) drives a turbulent magnetic field. Others model the large-scale dynamo (LSD) with magnetic field organised at the scale of the disc or spiral arms. Separately, neither can fully describe the dynamics of galactic magnetic fields nor represent their topology. We model the LSD and SSD together at high enough resolution to use explicit Lagrangian resistivity and viscosity. The galactic SSD saturates in less than 20 Myr. We show that the SSD is quite insensitive to the presence of an LSD and is even stronger in the presence of a large-scale shear flow. The LSD grows more slowly in the presence of SSD, saturating after 5 Gyr vs. 1--2 Gyr in studies where the SSD is weak or absent. The LSD primarily grows in warm gas in the galactic midplane. Saturation of the LSD occurs due to ${\alpha}$-quenching near the midplane as the growing mean field produces a magnetic ${\alpha}$ that opposes the kinetic ${\alpha}$. The magnetic energy in our models of the LSD shows slightly sublinear response to increasing resolution, indicating that we are converging towards the physical solution at 1 pc resolution. Including clustered supernovae from OB associations increases the rate of growth of both the SSD and the LSD compared to a horizontally uniform distribution.
