2023-09-28, **Cosmological constraints from density-split clustering in the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample**, Enrique Paillas et.al., [2309.16541v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16541v1)

 We present a clustering analysis of the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy sample, combining measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function and density-split clustering down to a scale of $1\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. Our theoretical framework is based on emulators trained on high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogues that forward model the cosmological dependence of the clustering statistics within an extended-$\Lambda$CDM framework, including redshift-space and Alcock-Paczynski distortions. Our base-$\Lambda$CDM analysis finds $\omega\_{\rm cdm} = 0.1201\pm 0.0022$, $\sigma\_8 = 0.792\pm 0.034$, and $n\_s = 0.970\pm 0.018$, corresponding to $f\sigma\_8 = 0.462\pm 0.020$ at $z \approx 0.525$, which is in agreement with Planck 2018 predictions and various clustering studies in the literature. We test single-parameter extensions to base-$\Lambda$CDM, varying the running of the spectral index, the dark energy equation of state, and the density of massless relic neutrinos, finding no compelling evidence for deviations from the base model. We model the galaxy-halo connection using a halo occupation distribution framework, finding signatures of environment-based assembly bias in the data. We validate our pipeline against mock catalogues that match the clustering and selection properties of CMASS, showing that we can recover unbiased cosmological constraints even with a volume 84 times larger than the one used in this study.

2023-09-28, **VAE-based latent-space classification of RNO-G data**, Thorsten Glüsenkamp et.al., [2309.16401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16401v1)

 The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is a radio-based ultra-high energy neutrino detector located at Summit Station, Greenland. It is still being constructed, with 7 stations currently operational. Neutrino detection works by measuring Askaryan radiation produced by neutrino-nucleon interactions. A neutrino candidate must be found amidst other backgrounds which are recorded at much higher rates -- including cosmic-rays and anthropogenic noise -- the origins of which are sometimes unknown. Here we describe a method to classify different noise classes using the latent space of a variational autoencoder. The latent space forms a compact representation that makes classification tractable. We analyze data from a noisy and a silent station. The method automatically detects and allows us to qualitatively separate multiple event classes, including physical wind-induced signals, for both the noisy and the quiet station.

2023-09-28, **Conditional normalizing flows for IceCube event reconstruction**, Thorsten Glüsenkamp et.al., [2309.16380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16380v1)

 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer high-energy neutrino detector deployed in the Antarctic ice. Two major event classes are charged-current electron and muon neutrino interactions. In this contribution, we discuss the inference of direction and energy for these classes using conditional normalizing flows. They allow to derive a posterior distribution for each individual event based on the raw data that can include systematic uncertainties, which makes them very promising for next-generation reconstructions. For each normalizing flow we use the differential entropy and the KL-divergence to its maximum entropy approximation to interpret the results. The normalizing flows correctly incorporate complex optical properties of the Antarctic ice and their relation to the embedded detector. For showers, the differential entropy increases in regions of high photon absorption and decreases in clear ice. For muons, the differential entropy strongly correlates with the contained track length. Coverage is maintained, even for low photon counts and highly asymmetrical contour shapes. For high-photon counts, the distributions get narrower and become more symmetrical, as expected from the asymptotic theorem of Bernstein-von-Mises. For shower directional reconstruction, we find the region between 1 TeV and 100 TeV to potentially benefit the most from normalizing flows because of azimuth-zenith asymmetries which have been neglected in previous analyses by assuming symmetrical contours. Events in this energy range play a vital role in the recent discovery of the galactic plane diffuse neutrino emission.

2023-09-28, **Large neutrino telescope Baikal-GVD: recent status**, V. M. Aynutdinov et.al., [2309.16310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16310v1)

 The Baikal-GVD is a deep-underwater neutrino telescope being constructed in Lake Baikal. After the winter 2023 deployment campaign the detector consists of 3456 optical modules installed on 96 vertical strings. The status of the detector and progress in data analysis are discussed in present report. The Baikal-GVD data collected in 2018-2022 indicate the presence of cosmic neutrino flux in high-energy cascade events consistent with observations by the IceCube neutrino telescope. Analysis of track-like events results in identification of first high-energy muon neutrino candidates. These and other results from 2018-2022 data samples are reviewed in this report.

2023-09-28, **Monitoring of optical properties of deep waters of Lake Baikal in 2021-2022**, V. M. Aynutdinov et.al., [2309.16300v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16300v1)

 We present the results of the two-year (2021-2022) monitoring of absorption and scattering lengths of light with wavelength 400-620 nm within the effective volume of the deep underwater neutrino telescope Baikal-GVD, which were measured by a device Baikal-5D No.2. The Baikal-5D No.2. was installed during the 2021 winter expedition at a depth of 1180 m. The absorption and scattering lengths were measured every week in 9 spectral points. The device Baikal-5D No.2 also has the ability to measure detailed scattering and absorption spectra. The data obtained make it possible to estimate the range of changes in the absorption and scattering lengths over a sufficiently long period of time and to investigate the relationship between the processes of changes in absorption and scattering. An analysis was made of changes in absorption and scattering spectra for the period 2021-2022.

2023-09-28, **Studies of the ambient light of deep Baikal waters with Baikal-GVD**, V. M. Aynutdinov et.al., [2309.16280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16280v1)

 The Baikal-GVD neutrino detector is a deep-underwater neutrino telescope under construction and recently after the winter 2023 deployment it consists of 3456 optical modules attached on 96 vertical strings. This 3-dimensional array of photo-sensors allows to observe ambient light in the vicinity of the Baikal-GVD telescope that is associated mostly with water luminescence. Results on time and space variations of the luminescent activity are reviewed based on data collected in 2018-2022.

2023-09-28, **Hunting for sterile neutrino with collider signatures**, Hao Yang et.al., [2309.16233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16233v1)

 We study the feasibility to observe sterile neutrino at the high energy colliders, using direct production channels $e^+e^-\to\bar{\nu}\_e N,\ e^-\gamma \to NW^-$ and indirect production channels through heavy meson/baryon and Higgs decay. We thus cover a mass window that is between what can be studied in heavy hadron factories and high energy colliders. For $e^+e^-\to\bar{\nu}\_e N$ channel, the sensitivity of active-sterile mixing $\|U\_{eN}\|^2$ in the lower mass end (0.3$\sim 2$ GeV) could be $10^{-6}$ at the SuperKEKB under its operation with designed luminosity, the sensitivity for hundreds GeV region can be further extended to $10^{-7}$ at the CEPC and the ILC. We also explore the heavy sterile neutrino production through $e^-\gamma \to NW^-$ channel at the ep collider, the mixing $\|U\_{eN}\|^2$ is estimated to reach a sensitivity of $10^{-4}$ at the LHeC if $m\_N$ to be electroweak energy mass scale, which can shed light on sterile neutrino searching at this mass region. For heavy hadron decay, the lepton-number-violating process in $\|\Delta L\|=2$ decays of $\Lambda\_c, \Xi\_{c}, \Xi\_{cc}$ and $\Lambda\_b$ are explored via an intermediate on-shell Majorana neutrino in GeV scale. The branching fractions and the lower-limit on $\|U\_{\ell N}\|^2$ versus $m\_N$ are given. The $Higgs \to W\mu\mu\pi$ channel is also considered, which is sensitive at lower mass scale.

2023-09-28, **Subsurface cosmogenic and radiogenic production of ^{42}Ar**, Sagar S. Poudel et.al., [2309.16169v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16169v1)

 Radioactive decays from ^{42}Ar and its progeny ^{42}K are potential background sources in large-scale liquid-argon-based neutrino and dark matter experiments. In the atmosphere, ^{42}Ar is produced primarily by cosmogenic activation on ^{40}Ar. The use of low radioactivity argon from cosmogenically shielded underground sources can expand the reach and sensitivity of liquid-argon-based rare event searches. We estimate ^{42}Ar production underground by nuclear reactions induced by natural radioactivity and cosmic-ray muon-induced interactions. At 3,000 mwe, ^{42}Ar production rate is 1.8E-3 atoms per ton of crust per year, 7 orders of magnitude smaller than the ^{39}Ar production rate at a similar depth in the crust. By comparing the calculated production rate of ^{42}Ar to that of ^{39}Ar for which the concentration has been measured in an underground gas sample, we estimate the activity of ^{42}Ar in gas extracted from 3,000 mwe depth to be less than 2 decays per ton of argon per year.

2023-09-28, **Non-thermal WIMPy Baryogenesis with Primordial Black Hole**, Ki-Young Choi et.al., [2309.16122v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16122v1)

 We consider the possibility that the weakly interacting massive particles produced from the evaporation of primordial black hole can explain both the relic density of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, through their annihilation which violate B and CP-symmetry. We find that the primordial black hole with mass less than $10^7 {\rm g}$ is a good candidate as an source of TeV dark matter with the total annihilation cross section $\left\langle\sigma\_a \upsilon\right\rangle \lesssim 10^{-7} \ {\rm GeV}^{-2}$ and the B-violating scattering cross section $\left\langle\sigma\_B \upsilon\right\rangle \lesssim 2\times 10^{-9} \ {\rm GeV^{-2}}$. This large annihilation cross section of dark matter in this model would make it available to search them in the indirect search for dark matter such as gamma-ray or neutrino observations.

2023-09-27, **DUNE potential as a New Physics probe**, Adriano Cherchiglia et.al., [2309.15924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15924v1)

 Neutrino experiments, in the next years, aim to determine with precision all the six parameters of the three-neutrino standard paradigm. The complete success of the experimental program is, nevertheless, attached to the non-existence (or at least smallness) of Non-Standard Interactions (NSI). In this work, anticipating the data taken from long-baseline neutrino experiments, we map all the weakly coupled theories that could induce sizable NSI, with the potential to be determined in these experiments, in particular DUNE. Once present constraints from other experiments are taken into account, in particular charged-lepton flavor violation, we find that only models containing leptoquarks (scalar or vector) and/or neutral isosinglet vector bosons are viable. We provide the explicit matching formulas connecting weakly coupled models and NSI, both in propagation and production. Departing from the weakly coupled completion with masses at TeV scale, we also provide a global fit on all NSI for DUNE, finding that NSI smaller than $10^{-2}$ cannot be probed even in the best-case scenario.

2023-09-27, **Limits on ALP-neutrino couplings from loop-level processes**, J. Bonilla et.al., [2309.15910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15910v1)

 We obtain new bounds on effective ALP-neutrino interactions from their loop-level impact on the ALP couplings to electroweak gauge bosons $\g Z$, $ZZ$ and $W^+W^-$. Both types of interactions are connected via the chiral anomaly, which allows to overcome the fermion mass suppression of tree-level analyses. ALP couplings to charged leptons are considered simultaneously with ALP-neutrino ones, as required by gauge invariance. Complete one-loop computations are presented together with relevant kinematic limits. We leverage data obtained from rare meson decay measurements alongside observations from collider experiments, among others. The novel constraints are particularly competitive for ALP masses $\gtrsim 100$ MeV, evidencing the powerful potential of future ALP searches at colliders which target its couplings to electroweak gauge bosons.

2023-09-27, **Dynamic fermion flavor mixing through transition dipole moments**, Johann Rafelski et.al., [2309.15797v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15797v1)

 We show that Majorana neutrino flavor mixing can be driven by transition dipole moments in the presence of external electromagnetic fields. We demonstrate the sensitivity of the rotation mixing matrix to strong fields obtaining dynamical mass eigenstates in the two-flavor model. The three-flavor case and extensions to the quark sector are introduced.

2023-09-27, **Joint searches by FACT, H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS for VHE gamma-ray emission associated with neutrinos detected by IceCube**, Fabian Schüssler et.al., [2309.15469v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15469v1)

 The sources of the astrophysical flux of high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube are still largely unknown, but searches for temporal and spatial correlation between neutrinos and electromagnetic radiation are a promising approach in this endeavor. All major imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) - FACT, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS - operate an active follow-up program of target-of-opportunity observations of neutrino alerts issued by IceCube. These programs use several complementary neutrino alert streams. A publicly distributed alert stream is formed by individual high-energy neutrino candidate events of potentially astrophysical origin, such as IceCube-170922A (which could be linked to the flaring blazar TXS\,0506+056). A privately distributed alert stream is formed by clusters of neutrino events in time and space around either pre-selected gamma-ray sources or anywhere in the sky. Here, we present joint searches for multi-wavelength emission associated with a set of IceCube alerts, both private and public, received through mid-January 2021. We will give an overview of the programs of the participating IACTs. We will showcase the various follow-up and data analysis strategies employed in response to the different alert types and various possible counterpart scenarios. Finally, we will present results from a combined analysis of the VHE gamma-ray observations obtained across all involved instruments, as well as relevant multi-wavelength data.

2023-09-27, **Neutrino properties from the laboratory and the cosmos**, Pablo Martínez-Miravé et.al., [2309.15446v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15446v1)

 Neutrinos are amongst the most abundant particles in the universe. The fact that they are massive particles proves that the Standard Model is an incomplete theory and needs to be extended. This thesis focuses on the study of neutrino properties from the available data from laboratory experiments and cosmological observations. It also presents sensitivity studies for future neutrino experiments. The first part covers the status of the determination of the oscillation parameters in the three-neutrino framework, the mass ordering and the absolute mass scale. A second part is devoted to other neutrino properties predicted in neutrino mass models. The topics covered include the study of spin-flavour precession in solar neutrinos from non-zero neutrino magnetic moments, the prospects for neutrino non-standard interactions with quarks from the solar sector and the expected limits on CPT violation from a separate analysis of neutrino and antineutrino data. Regarding cosmology, the impact of non-standard interactions with electrons and a non-unitary three-neutrino mixing matrix in the process of neutrino decoupling are addressed. Finally, a third part explores possible connections between dark matter and neutrinos. The existence of dark matter has been proven indirectly via its gravitational effects. This thesis presents two studies that explore how neutrinos could probe the fraction of dark matter that could exist in the form of primordial black holes and the experimental signatures expected from a hypothetical coupling between neutrinos and an ultralight scalar dark matter candidate.

2023-09-27, **MicroBooNE Public Data Sets: a Collaborative Tool for LArTPC Software Development**, Giuseppe Cerati et.al., [2309.15362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15362v1)

 Among liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) experiments MicroBooNE is the one that continually took physics data for the longest time (2015-2021), and represents the state of the art for reconstruction and analysis with this detector. Recently published analyses include oscillation physics results, searches for anomalies and other BSM signatures, and cross section measurements. LArTPC detectors are being used in current experiments such as ICARUS and SBND, and being planned for future experiments such as DUNE. MicroBooNE has recently released to the public two of its data sets, with the goal of enabling collaborative software developments with other LArTPC experiments and with AI or computing experts. These data sets simulate neutrino interactions on top of off-beam data, which include cosmic ray background and noise. The data sets are released in two formats: the native art/ROOT format used internally by the collaboration and familiar to other LArTPC experts, and the HDF5 format which contains reduced and simplified content and is suitable for usage by the broader community. This contribution presents the open data sets, discusses their motivation, the technical implementation, and the extensive documentation -- all inspired by FAIR principles. Finally, opportunities for collaborations are discussed.

2023-09-28, **Higgs-Portal Dark Matter in Brane-World Cosmology**, Taoli Liu et.al., [2309.16625v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16625v1)

 The Higgs-portal scalar dark matter (DM) model is a simple extension of the Standard Model (SM) to incorporate a DM particle to the SM, where a $Z\_2$-odd real scalar field is introduced as a DM candidate. We consider this DM model in the context of 5-dimensional brane-world cosmology, where our 3-dimensional space is realized as a hyper-surface embedded in 4-dimensional space. In the setup, all the SM and DM fields reside on the hyper-surface while graviton lives in the bulk. We consider two well-known brane-world cosmologies, namely, the Randall-Sundrum (RS) and the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) brane-world cosmologies, in which the standard Big Bang cosmology is reproduced at low temperatures below the so-called ``transition temperature" while at high temperatures the expansion law of the universe is significantly modified. Such a non-standard expansion law directly impacts the prediction for the relic density of the Higgs-portal DM. We investigate the brane-world cosmological effects and identify the allowed model parameter region by combining the constraints from the observed DM relic density, and the direct and indirect DM detection experiments. It is well-known that only DM masses in the vicinity of half the Higgs boson mass are allowed in the Higgs-portal scalar DM model. We find that the allowed parameter region becomes more severely constrained and even disappears in the RS cosmology, while the GB cosmological effect significantly enlarges the allowed region. Upon discovering Higgs-portal DM, we can determine transition temperature in the GB brane-world cosmology.

2023-09-28, **Constraining Ultralight Dark Matter through an Accelerated Resonant Search**, Zitong Xu et.al., [2309.16600v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16600v1)

 Experiments aimed at detecting ultralight dark matter typically rely on resonant effects, which are sensitive to the dark matter mass that matches the resonance frequency. In this study, we investigate the nucleon couplings of ultralight axion dark matter using a magnetometer operating in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) mode. Our approach involves the use of a $^{21}$Ne spin-based sensor, which features the lowest nuclear magnetic moment among noble-gas spins. This configuration allows us to achieve an ultrahigh sensitivity of 0.73 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ at around 5 Hz, corresponding to energy resolution of approximately 1.5$\times   10^{-23}\,\rm{eV/Hz^{1/2}}$. Our analysis reveals that under certain conditions it is beneficial to scan the frequency with steps significantly larger than the resonance width. The analytical results are in agreement with experimental data and the scan strategy is potentially applicable to other resonant searches. Further, our study establishes stringent constraints on axion-like particles (ALP) in the 4.5--15.5 Hz Compton-frequency range coupling to neutrons and protons, improving on prior work by several-fold. Within a band around 4.6--6.6 Hz and around 7.5 Hz, our laboratory findings surpass astrophysical limits derived from neutron-star cooling. Hence, we demonstrate an accelerated resonance search for ultralight dark matter, achieving an approximately 30-fold increase in scanning step while maintaining competitive sensitivity.

2023-09-28, **Weak Deflection Angle, Hawking Radiation, Greybody Bound and Shadow Cast for Static Black Hole in the Framework of $f(R)$ Gravity**, Surajit Mandal et.al., [2309.16461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16461v1)

 In this work, we probe the weak gravitational lensing by a static spherically symmetric black hole in view of $f(R)$ gravity in the background of the non-plasma medium (vacuum). We provide a discussion on a light ray in a static black hole solution in $f(R)$ gravity. To adore this purpose, we find the Gaussian optical curvature in weak gravitational lensing by utilizing the optical geometry of this black hole solution. Furthermore, we find the deflection angle in non-plasma medium up to the leading order by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (considering Gibbons and Werner's technique). We present the graphical analysis of the deflection angle with respect to the various parameters that govern the black hole. Further, we calculate the Hawking temperature for this black hole via a topological method and compare it with a standard method of deriving the Hawking temperature. We also analyze the Schr\"odinger-like Regge-Wheeler equation and derive a bound on the greybody factor for a static black hole in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity and graphically inquire that bound converges to 1. We also investigate the silhouette or shadow generated by this static $f(R)$ black hole. Moreover, we constrain the non-negative real constant (linear dark-matter-related parameter for considered black hole) from the observed angular diameters of M87* and Sgr A* released by the EHT. Finally, we probe how cosmological constant, non-negative real constant and mass affected the radius of shadow.

2023-09-28, **Primordial black holes in scalar field inflation coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term with fractional power-law potentials**, Ali Ashrafzadeh et.al., [2309.16356v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16356v1)

 In this study, we investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a scalar field inflationary model coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term with fractional power-law potentials. The coupling function enhances the curvature perturbations, then results in the generation of PBHs and detectable secondary gravitational waves (GWs). % We identify three separate sets of parameters for the potential functions of the form $\phi^{1/3}$, $\phi^{2/5}$, and $\phi^{2/3}$. By adjusting the model parameters, we decelerate the inflaton during the ultra slow-roll (USR) phase and enhance curvature perturbations. % Our calculations predict the formation of PBHs with masses of ${\cal O}(10)M\_{\odot}$, which are compatible with LIGO-Virgo observational data. Additionally, we find PBHs with masses around ${\cal O}(10^{-6})M\_{\odot}$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-5})M\_{\odot}$, which can explain ultrashort-timescale microlensing events in OGLE data. % Furthermore, our proposed mechanism could lead to the formation of PBHs in mass scales around ${\cal O}(10^{-14})M\_{\odot}$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-13})M\_{\odot}$, contributing to approximately 99\% of the dark matter in the universe. % We also study the production of secondary GWs in our model. In all cases of the model, the density parameter of secondary GWs $\Omega\_{\rm GW\_0}$ exhibits peaks that intersect the sensitivity curves of GWs detectors, providing a means to verify our findings using data of these detectors. % Our numerical results demonstrate a power-law behavior for the spectra of $\Omega\_{\rm GW\_0}$ with respect to frequency, given by $\Omega\_{\rm GW\_0} (f) \sim (f/f\_c)^{n}$. Additionally, in the infrared regime where $f\ll f\_{c}$, the power index takes a log-dependent form, specifically $n=3-2/\ln(f\_c/f)$.

2023-09-27, **Universal determination of comagnetometer response to spin couplings**, Mikhail Padniuk et.al., [2309.16000v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16000v1)

 We propose and demonstrate a general method to calibrate the frequency-dependent response of self-compensating noble-gas-alkali-metal comagnetometers to arbitrary spin perturbations. This includes magnetic and nonmagnetic perturbations like rotations and exotic spin interactions. The method is based on a fit of the magnetic field response to an analytical model. The frequency-dependent response of the comagnetometer to arbitrary spin perturbations can be inferred using the fit parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by comparing the inferred rotation response to an experimental measurement of the rotation response. Our results show that experiments relying on zero-frequency calibration of the comagnetometer response can over- or under-estimate the comagnetometer sensitivity by orders of magnitude over a wide frequency range. Moreover, this discrepancy accumulates over time as operational parameters tend to drift during comagnetometer operation. The demonstrated calibration protocol enables accurate prediction and control of comagnetometer sensitivity to, for example, ultralight bosonic dark-matter fields coupling to electron or nuclear spins as well as accurate monitoring and control of the relevant system parameters.

2023-09-27, **LMC-driven anisotropic boosts in stream--subhalo interactions**, Arpit Arora et.al., [2309.15998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15998v1)

 Dark Matter (DM) subhalos are predicted to perturb stellar streams; stream morphologies and dynamics can constrain the mass distribution of subhalos. Using FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, we show that presence of a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)--analog significantly changes stream-subhalo encounter rates. Three key factors drive these changes. First, the LMC--analog brings in many subhalos, increasing encounter rates for streams near the massive satellite by up to 20--40%. Second, the LMC--analog displaces the host from its center-of-mass (inducing reflex motion), causing a north-south asymmetry in the density and radial velocity distribution of subhalos. This asymmetry results in encounter rates varying by 50--70% across the sky at the same distance. Finally, the LMC--mass satellite induces a density wake in the host's DM halo, further boosting the encounter rates near the LMC--analog. We also explore the influence of stream orbital properties, finding a 50% increase in encounters for streams moving retrograde to the LMC--analog's orbit in the opposite hemisphere. The dependence of encounter rates on stream location and orbit has important implications for where to search for new streams with spurs and gaps in the Milky Way.

2023-09-27, **Review on $f(Q)$ Gravity**, Lavinia Heisenberg et.al., [2309.15958v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15958v1)

 Recent years have witnessed a rise in interest in the geometrical trinity of General Relativity and its extensions. This interest has been fuelled by novel insights into the nature of gravity, the possibility to address computational and conceptual questions -- such as the determination of black hole entropy or the definition of gravitational energy-momentum -- from a new perspective. In particular, $f(Q)$ gravity has also inspired numerous works on black holes, wormholes, and cosmology. In the latter case, $f(Q)$ models have the potential to elucidate phenomena in both early and late-time cosmology without necessitating the inclusion of dark energy, the inflaton field, or dark matter. Particularly noteworthy is the role of $f(Q)$ theories in addressing cosmological tensions, presenting exciting possibilities for reshaping our understanding of gravity and its manifestations in cosmology. The emergence of intriguing new black hole solutions and the potential existence of wormhole solutions suggest the presence of novel physics within the realm of strong gravity. These phenomena have become increasingly measurable only in recent times, opening up exciting avenues for further exploration and discovery. This review is tailored to students and researchers alike. It offers a self-contained and pedagogical introduction to metric-affine geometry--The mathematical foundation and indispensable tool upon which the geometrical trinity of General Relativity as well as its various extensions are built.

2023-09-27, **Elastic Scattering of Cosmological Gravitational Wave Backgrounds: Primordial Black Holes and Stellar Objects**, Marcell Howard et.al., [2309.15925v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15925v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are plausible dark matter candidates that formed from the gravitational collapse of primordial density fluctuations. Current observational constraints allow asteroid-mass PBHs to account for all of the cosmological dark matter. We show that elastic scattering of a cosmological gravitational wave background, these black holes generate spectral distortions on the background of 0.3% for cosmologically relevant frequencies. Scattering from stellar objects induce much smaller distortions. Detectability of this signal depends on our ultimate understanding of the unperturbed background spectrum.

2023-09-27, **Dynamics of Long-lived Axion Domain Walls and Its Cosmological Implications**, Chia-Feng Chang et.al., [2309.15920v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15920v1)

 We perform an updated analysis on a long-lived axion domain wall (DW) network. By simulating the axion field on a 3D lattice and fitting an analytical model for the DW evolution, we identify the leading energy loss mechanisms of the DWs and compute the spectrum of axions emitted from the network. The contribution from the DWs to axion dark matter (DM) density is derived, with viable parameter space given. The application to both QCD axions and general axion-like particles (ALPs) are considered. Due to the new approaches taken, while our results bear consistency with earlier literature, notable discrepancies are also revealed, such as the prediction for DM abundance, which may have a profound impact on axion phenomenology at large.

2023-09-27, **Enabling multi-messenger astronomy with continuous gravitational waves: early warning and sky localization of binary neutron stars in Einstein Telescope**, Andrew L. Miller et.al., [2309.15808v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15808v1)

 Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors will provide unprecedented sensitivity to inspiraling binary neutron stars and black holes, enabling detections at the peak of star formation and beyond. However, the signals from these systems will last much longer than those in current detectors, and overlap in both time and frequency, leading to increased computational cost to search for them with standard matched filtering analyses, and a higher probability that they are observed in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. We therefore present a method to search for gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals in next-generation detectors that is computationally efficient and robust against gaps in data collection and noise non-stationarities. Our method, based on the Hough Transform, finds tracks in the time/frequency plane of the detector that uniquely describe specific inspiraling systems. We find that we could detect $\sim 5$ overlapping, intermediate-strength signals without a sensitivity loss. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can enable multi-messenger astronomy: using only low frequencies ($2-20$ Hz), we could warn astronomers $\sim 2.5$ hours before a GW170817-like merger at 40 Mpc and provide a sky localization of $\sim 20$ deg$^2$ using only one interferometer. Additionally, assuming that primordial black holes (PBHs) exist, we derive projected constraints on the fraction of dark matter they could compose, $f\_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-4}$, for $\sim 1-0.1M\_\odot$ equal-mass systems, respectively, using a rate suppression factor $f\_{\rm sup}=2.5\times 10^{-3}$. Our method only incurs a strain sensitivity loss of a factor of a few at binary neutron star masses compared to the matched filter, which may be reduced depending on available computational power.

2023-09-27, **A new class of anisotropic rotating fluids and some throat-like sources for Kerr metric as examples**, Stefano Viaggiu et.al., [2309.15439v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15439v1)

 Motivated by the increasing interest in finding physically viable rotating sources, we present a new class of anisotropic rotating solutions. The energy-momentum tensor compatible with the metric is composed of anisotropic matter with a non-vanishing energy flow around the symmetry axis and vanishing viscosity. The new class of solutions can be used to find new possible sources for the Kerr metric, to obtain new regular black hole solutions and to study galaxies with a central rotating black hole and an halo of dark matter. As an example, we obtain a 5-parameter class of solutions representing a two-way traversable wormhole smoothly matched to the Kerr one and satisfying all energy conditions outside the wormhole for a wide range of parameters, in particular for compact objects. Finally, with a simple modification of the aforementioned solution, we obtain a source for Kerr metric with a throat geometry, non-representing a two-way traversable wormhole and satisfying all energy conditions.

 In this work, we present the first lattice QCD study on the invisible decay $J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma\nu\bar{\nu}$. The calculation is accomplished using $N\_f=2$ twisted mass fermion ensembles. The excited-state effects are observed and eliminated using a multi-state fit. The impact of finite-volume effects is also examined and confirmed to be well-controlled. After a continuous extrapolation under three lattice spacings, we obtain the branching fraction as $\operatorname{Br}[J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma\nu\bar{\nu}]=1.00(9)(7)\times 10^{-10}$, where the first error is the statistical error and the second is an estimate of the systematics. The exact theoretical prediction can be used to remove the only invisible contamination from the standard model background in searching for the possible dark matter by the channel $J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma+\textrm{invisible}$

 Supernova remnants are the nebular leftover of defunct stellar environments, resulting from the interaction between a supernova blastwave and the circumstellar medium shaped by the progenitor throughout its life. They display a large variety of non-spherical morphologies such as ears that shine non-thermally. % We have modelled the structure and the non-thermal emission of the supernova remnant G1.9+0.3 through 3D magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations. We propose that the peculiar ear-shaped morphology of this supernova remnant results from the interaction of the its blast wave with a magnetized circumstellar medium, which was previously asymmetrically shaped by the past stellar wind emanating from the progenitor star or its stellar companion. We created synthetic non-thermal radio and x-ray maps from our simulated remnant structure, which are in qualitative agreement with observations, forming ears on the polar directions. Our synthetic map study explains the discrepancies between the measured non-thermal radio and X-ray surface brightness distributions assuming that the Inverse Compton process produces the observed X-ray emission.

2023-09-28, **Internal Shocks Hydrodynamics: the Collision of Two Cold Shells in Detail**, Sk. Minhajur Rahaman et.al., [2309.16327v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16327v1)

 Emission in many astrophysical transients originates from a shocked fluid. A central engine typically produces an outflow with varying speeds, leading to internal collisions within the outflow at finite distances from the source. Each such collision produces a pair of forward and reverse shocks with the two shocked regions separated by a contact discontinuity (CD). As a useful approximation, we consider the head-on collision between two cold and uniform shells (a slower leading shell and a faster trailing shell) of finite radial width, and study the dynamics of shock propagation in planar geometry. We find significant differences between the forward and reverse shocks, in terms of their strength, internal energy production efficiency, and the time it takes for the shocks to sweep through the respective shells. We consider the subsequent propagation of rarefaction waves in the shocked regions and explore the cases where these waves can catch up with the shock fronts and thereby limit the internal energy dissipation. We demonstrate the importance of energy transfer from the trailing to leading shell through $pdV$ work across the CD. We outline the parameter space regions relevant for models of different transients,e.g., Gamma-ray burst (GRB) internal shock model, fast radio burst (FRB) blastwave model, Giant flare due to magnetars, and superluminous supernovae (SLSN) ejecta. We find that the reverse shock likely dominates the internal energy production for many astrophysical transients.

2023-09-28, **JWST reveals a luminous infrared source at the position of the failed supernova candidate N6946-BH1**, Emma R. Beasor et.al., [2309.16121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16121v1)

 N6946-BH1 is the first plausible candidate for a failed supernova (SN), a peculiar event in which a massive star disappears without the expected bright SN, accompanied by collapse into a black hole (BH). Following a luminous outburst in 2009, the source experienced a significant decline in optical brightness, while maintaining a persistent infrared (IR) presence. While it was proposed to be a potential failed SN, such behavior has been observed in SN impostor events in nearby galaxies. Here, we present late-time observations of BH1, taken 14 years after disappearance, using JWST's NIRCam and MIRI instruments to probe a never-before-observed region of the object's spectral energy distribution. We show for the first time that all previous observations of BH1 (pre- and post-disappearance) are actually a blend of at least 3 sources. In the near-IR, BH1 is notably fainter than the progenitor but retains similar brightness to its state in 2017. In the mid-IR, the flux appears to have brightened compared to the inferred fluxes from the best-fitting progenitor model. The total luminosity of the source is between 13 - 25% that of the progenitor. We also show that the IR SED appears consistent with PAH features that arise when dust is illuminated by near-ultraviolet radiation. At present, the interpretation of N6946-BH1 remains uncertain. The observations match expectations for a stellar merger, but theoretical ambiguity in the failed SN hypothesis makes it hard to dismiss.

2023-09-27, **Exploring Modified Gravity: Constraints on the $μ$ and $Σ$ Parametrization with WMAP, ACT, and SPT**, Uendert Andrade et.al., [2309.15781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15781v1)

 The cosmic acceleration problem remains one of the most significant challenges in cosmology. One of the proposed solutions to this problem is the modification of gravity on large scales. In this paper, we explore the well-known $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ parametrization scenarios, and confront them with observational data, including the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and South Pole Telescope (SPT), as well as large-scale structure data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS: BAO+RSD) and Pantheon Supernovae (SN) catalog. We employ a Bayesian framework to constrain the model parameters and discuss the implications of our results on the viability of modified gravity theories. Our analysis reveals the strengths and limitations of the $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ parametrization and provides valuable insights into the nature of gravity on cosmological scales. From the joint analysis ACT + WMAP + SDDS + SN, we find $\mu -1 = 0.02 \pm 0.19$ and $\Sigma -1 = 0.021 \pm 0.068$ at 68\% CL. In light of the SPT + WMAP + SDDS + SN, we find $\mu -1 = 0.07 \pm 0.18$ and $\Sigma -1 = -0.009^{+0.078}\_{-0.11}$ at 68\% CL. We also discuss and present several other results involving these datasets. In all the analysis carried out, we did not find any deviations from the theory of general relativity. Our results represent an observational update on the well-known $\mu$-$\Sigma$ parameterization in view of current CMB data, independent and competitive with the constraints obtained with the Planck data.

2023-09-27, **Beyond $Λ$CDM with $f(z)$CDM: criticalities and solutions of Padé Cosmography**, Alexandra T. Petreca et.al., [2309.15711v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15711v1)

 Recently, cosmography emerged as a valuable tool to effectively describe the vast amount of astrophysical observations without relying on a specific cosmological model. Its model-independent nature ensures a faithful representation of data, free from theoretical biases. Indeed, the commonly assumed fiducial model, the $\Lambda$CDM, shows some shortcomings and tensions between data at late and early times that need to be further investigated. In this paper, we explore an extension of the standard cosmological model by adopting the $f(z)$CDM approach, where $f(z)$ represents the cosmographic series characterizing the evolution of recent universe driven by dark energy. To construct $f(z)$, we take into account the Pad\'e series, since this rational polynomial approximation offers a better convergence at high redshifts than the standard Taylor series expansion. Several orders of such an approximant have been proposed in previous works, here we want to answer the questions: What is the impact of the cosmographic series choice on the parameter constraints? Which series is the best for the analysis? So, we analyse the most promising ones by identifying which order is preferred in terms of stability and goodness of fit. Theoretical predictions of the $f(z)$CDM model are obtained by the Boltzmann solver code and the posterior distributions of the cosmological and cosmographic parameters are constrained by a Monte Carlo Markov Chains analysis. We consider a joint data set of cosmic microwave background temperature measurements from the Planck collaboration, type Ia supernovae data from the latest Pantheon+ sample, baryonic acoustic oscillations and cosmic chronometers data. In conclusions, we state which series can be used when only late time data are used, while which orders has to be considered in order to achieve the necessary stability when large redshifts are considered.
