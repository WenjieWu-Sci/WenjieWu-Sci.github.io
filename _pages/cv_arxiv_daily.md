2024-09-17, **Fast radio bursts as a probe of gravity on cosmological scales**, Dennis Neumann et.al., [2409.11163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11163v1)

 We explore the potential for improving constraints on gravity by leveraging correlations in the dispersion measure derived from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in combination with cosmic shear. Specifically, we focus on Horndeski gravity, inferring the kinetic braiding and Planck mass run rate from a stage-4 cosmic shear mock survey alongside a survey comprising $10^4$ FRBs. For the inference pipeline, we utilise hi\_class to predict the linear matter power spectrum in modified gravity scenarios, while non-linear corrections are modelled with HMcode, including feedback mechanisms. Our findings indicate that FRBs can disentangle degeneracies between baryonic feedback and cosmological parameters, as well as the mass of massive neutrinos. Since these parameters are also degenerate with modified gravity parameters, the inclusion of FRBs can enhance constraints on Horndeski parameters by up to $40$ percent, despite being a less significant measurement. Additionally, we apply our model to current FRB data and use the uncertainty in the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation to impose limits on gravity. However, due to the limited sample size of current data, constraints are predominantly influenced by theoretical priors. Despite this, our study demonstrates that FRBs will significantly augment the limited set of cosmological probes available, playing a critical role in providing alternative tests of feedback, cosmology, and gravity. All codes used in this work are made publically available.

2024-09-17, **Capability of Cosmic Gravitational Focusing on Identifying the Neutrino Mass Ordering**, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., [2409.11115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11115v1)

 The cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) of relic neutrinos can provide an independent measurement of the absolute neutrino masses $m\_i$ with fourth-power dependence ($m^4\_i$). We demonstrate in this paper for the first time how this can help identifying the neutrino mass ordering (NMO). Upon incorporating the projected CGF sensitivity at DESI, the preference for the normal ordering (NO) with a prior $\sum m\_\nu > 0.509\,{\rm eV}$ would increase from the original 89.9\% of the current clustering method with both DESI BAO and CMB to 98.2\% while the inverted ordering (IO) is further disfavored from 10.1\% to 1.8\%. We also show how this can affect the prospects of the neutrinoless double beta decay and single beta decay measurements.

2024-09-17, **Lepton seesaw model in a modular $A_4$ symmetry**, Takaaki Nomura et.al., [2409.10912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10912v1)

 We propose a lepton seesaw model to get the same mass-origin of charged-leptons and neutrinos introducing a modular $A\_4$ symmetry. In this scenario, the mass matrix of charged-leptons is induced via seesaw-like mechanism while the mass matrix of neutrino is realized via an inverse seesaw mechanism with help of vector-like fermions and an isospin singlet and triplet scalar field with nonzero vacuum expectation values. In analyzing the model we concentrate on fixed points of modulus $\tau$ that is favored by a flux compactification of Type IIB string theory. We search for allowed region at nearby these fixed points and find good solutions at nearby $\tau=\omega$ with several good predictions.

2024-09-17, **Stable Case BB/BC Mass Transfer to Form GW190425-like Massive Binary Neutron Star Mergers**, Ying Qin et.al., [2409.10869v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10869v1)

 On April 25th, 2019, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration discovered a Gravitational-wave (GW) signal from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, i.e., GW190425. Due to the inferred large total mass, the origin of GW190425 remains unclear. We perform detailed stellar structure and binary evolution calculations that take into account mass-loss, internal differential rotation, and tidal interactions between a He-rich star and a NS companion. We explore the parameter space of the initial binary properties, including initial NS and He-rich masses and initial orbital period. We find that the immediate post-common-envelope progenitor system, consisting of a primary $\sim2.0\,M\_\odot$ ($\sim1.7\,M\_\odot$) NS and a secondary He-rich star with an initial mass of $\sim3.0-5.5\,M\_\odot$ ($\sim5.5-6.0\,M\_\odot$) in a close binary with an initial period of $\sim0.08-0.5\,{\rm{days}}$ ($\sim 0.08-0.4\,{\rm{days}}$), that experiences stable Case BB/BC mass transfer (MT) during binary evolution, can reproduce the formation of GW190425-like BNS events. Our studies reveal that the secondary He-rich star of the GW190425's progenitor before its core collapse can be efficiently spun up through tidal interaction, finally remaining as a NS with rotational energy even reaching $\sim10^{52}\,{\rm{erg}}$, which is always much higher than the neutrino-driven energy of the supernova (SN) explosion. If the newborn secondary NS is a magnetar, we expect that GW190425 can be the remnant of a magnetar-driven SN, e.g., a magnetar-driven ultra-stripped SN, a superluminous SN, or a broad-line Type Ic SN. Our results show that GW190425 could be formed through the isolated binary evolution, which involves a stable Case BB/BC MT just after the common envelope phase. On top of that, we show the He-rich star can be tidally spun up, potentially forming a spinning magnetized NS (magnetar) during the second SN explosion.

2024-09-17, **Teaching dark matter simulations to speak the halo language**, Shivam Pandey et.al., [2409.11401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11401v1)

 We develop a transformer-based conditional generative model for discrete point objects and their properties. We use it to build a model for populating cosmological simulations with gravitationally collapsed structures called dark matter halos. Specifically, we condition our model with dark matter distribution obtained from fast, approximate simulations to recover the correct three-dimensional positions and masses of individual halos. This leads to a first model that can recover the statistical properties of the halos at small scales to better than 3% level using an accelerated dark matter simulation. This trained model can then be applied to simulations with significantly larger volumes which would otherwise be computationally prohibitive with traditional simulations, and also provides a crucial missing link in making end-to-end differentiable cosmological simulations. The code, named GOTHAM (Generative cOnditional Transformer for Halo's Auto-regressive Modeling) is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/shivampcosmo/GOTHAM}.

2024-09-17, **Imaging fermionic dark matter cores at the center of galaxies**, Joaquin Pelle et.al., [2409.11229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11229v1)

 Current images of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) candidates at the center of our Galaxy and M87 have opened an unprecedented era for studying strong gravity and the nature of relativistic sources. Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) data show images consistent with a central SMBH within General Relativity (GR). However, it is essential to consider whether other well-motivated dark compact objects within GR could produce similar images. Recent studies have shown that dark matter (DM) halos modeled as self-gravitating systems of neutral fermions can harbor very dense fermionic cores at their centers, which can mimic the spacetime features of a black hole (BH). Such dense, horizonless DM cores can satisfy the observational constraints: they can be supermassive and compact and lack a hard surface. We investigate whether such cores can produce similar observational signatures to those of BHs when illuminated by an accretion disk. We compute images and spectra of the fermion cores with a general-relativistic ray tracing technique, assuming the radiation originates from standard $\alpha$ disks, which are self-consistently solved within the current DM framework. Our simulated images possess a central brightness depression surrounded by a ring-like feature, resembling what is expected in the BH scenario. For Milky Way-like halos, the central brightness depressions have diameters down to $\sim 35\, \mu$as as measured from a distance of approximately $8\,$kpc. Finally, we show that the DM cores do not possess photon rings, a key difference from the BH paradigm, which could help discriminate between the models.

2024-09-17, **$Î›$CDM Model Extension with Dissipative Dynamics and Sign-Switching Bulk Viscous Pressure**, Vishnu A Pai et.al., [2409.10919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10919v1)

 In this article, we extend the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by incorporating causal viscous dark matter (vDM) modelled using Maxwell-Cattaneo theory and obtain a novel Hubble parameter solution for the model, which can even be extended to incorporate both radiation and baryonic matter components. A detailed and comprehensive analysis of the model is carried out by deriving theoretical constraints on model parameters, comparing the model with the latest observational data sets and validating the behaviour of the model under different thermodynamic laws. Such an in-depth analysis of the model yielded several intriguing results, like the presence of sign-switching bulk viscous pressure which aids both, the decelerated expansion in the early universe and the accelerated expansion in the late universe, possibility of having negative specific entropy rate in the early Universe while still satisfying the covariant second law of thermodynamics, and a correlation between relaxation time parameter and sign-switching redshift. Finally, we propose a unified dark matter (UDM) interpretation for the dark sector in this model and hence showed that, under the said UDM interpretation, this model can satisfy the much-required near equilibrium condition associated with the background dissipative theory both in the early and late phase of the Universe. Based on the NEC trend showcased by the model, we conjuncture that the late-accelerating behaviour of Universe can be viewed as a means for the UDM fluid to attain a global equilibrium state.

2024-09-17, **Probing dark-matter effects with gravitational waves using the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework**, Eileen Wilcox et.al., [2409.10846v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10846v1)

 A massive black hole can develop a dark-matter overdensity, and the dark matter changes the evolution of a stellar-mass compact object inspiraling around the massive black hole through the dense dark-matter environment. Specifically, dynamical friction speeds up the inspiral of the compact object and causes feedback on the dark-matter distribution. These intermediate mass-ratio inspirals with dark matter are a source of gravitational waves (GWs), and the waves can dephase significantly from an equivalent system in vacuum. Prior work has shown that this dephasing needs to be modeled to detect the GWs from these systems with LISA (the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna); it also showed that the density and distribution of dark matter can be inferred from a GW measurement. In this paper, we study whether the parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework can be used to infer the presence of dark matter in these systems. We confirm that if vacuum waveform templates are used to model the GWs from an inspiral in a dark-matter halo, then the resulting parameter estimation is biased. We then apply the ppE framework to determine whether it can reduce the parameter-estimation biases, and we find that adding one ppE phase term to a waveform template eliminates the parameter-estimation biases (statistical errors become larger than the systematic ones), but the effective post-Newtonian order in the ppE framework must be specified without uncertainties. When the post-Newtonian order has uncertainty, we find that the systematic errors on the ppE and the binary's parameters exceed the statistical errors. Thus, the simplest ppE framework would not give unbiased results for these systems, and a further extension of it, or dedicated parameter estimation with gravitational waveforms that include dark-matter effects would be needed.

2024-09-17, **Constraints on the maximal number of dark degrees of freedom from black hole evaporation, cosmic rays, colliders, and supernovae**, Christopher Ewasiuk et.al., [2409.11359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11359v1)

 A dark sector with a very large number of massive degrees of freedom is generically constrained by radiative corrections to Newton's constant. However, there are caveats to this statement, especially if the degrees of freedom are light or mass-less. Here, we examine in detail and update a number of constraints on the possible number of dark degrees of freedom, including from black hole evaporation, from perturbations to systems including an evaporating black hole, from direct gravitational production at colliders, from high-energy cosmic rays, and from supernovae energy losses.

2024-09-17, **Features and prospects for Kilonova remnant detection with current and future surveys**, Sandeep Kumar Acharya et.al., [2409.11291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11291v1)

 We study the observable spectral and temporal properties of kilonova remnants analytically, and showcase quantitative differences with respect to supernova remnants. We provide detection prospects of kilonova remnants in the context of ongoing radio surveys. We find that there is a good chance to expect 10s of such objects in future surveys with a flux threshold of $\sim 0.1$ mJy. Kilonova remnants from a postulated population of long lived supramassive neutron star remnants of neutron star mergers are even more likely to be detected as they are extremely bright and peak earlier. For ongoing survey with threshold of $\sim$ mJy, we expect to find 10-100s of such objects if they are a significant fraction of total kilonova population. Considering that there are no promising such kilonovae candidates in current surveys, we constrain the fraction of such extreme kilonova to be no more than 30 percent of the overall kilonovae rate, depending on the details of ejecta mass and external density distribution.

2024-09-17, **Evidence for gravitational self-lensing of the central supermassive black hole binary in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1566**, Wolfram Kollatschny et.al., [2409.11209v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11209v1)

 It is generally accepted that all massive galaxies host supermassive black holes (BHs) in their center and that mergers of two galaxies lead to the formation of BH binaries. The most interesting among them comprise the mergers in their final state, that is to say with parsec (3.2 light years) or sub-parsec orbital separations. It is possible to detect these systems with binary self-lensing. Here we report the potential detection of a central supermassive BH binary in the active galaxy (AGN) NGC1566 based on a microlensing outburst. The light curve of the outburst - based on observations with the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae - lasted from the beginning of 2017 until the beginning of 2020. The steep symmetric light curve as well as its shape look very different with respect to normal random variations in AGN. However, the observations could be easily reproduced with a best-fit standard microlensing light curve. Based on the light curve, we derived a characteristic timescale of 155 days. During the outburst, the continuum as well as the broad line intensities varied; however, the narrow emission lines did not. This is an indication that the lensing object orbits the AGN nucleus between the broad line region (BLR) and the narrow line region (NLR), that is, at a distance on the order of 250 light days. The light curve can be reproduced by a lens with a BH mass of 5*10^{5} M\_solar. This implies a mass ratio to the central AGN on the order of 1 to 10.

2024-09-17, **Investigating the CREDIT history of supernova remnants as cosmic-ray sources**, Anton Stall et.al., [2409.11012v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11012v1)

 Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been suspected to be the primary sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Over the past decades, great strides have been made in the modelling of particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification, and escape from SNRs. Yet, while many SNRs have been observed in non-thermal emission in radio, X-rays, and gamma-rays, there is no evidence for any individual object contributing to the locally observed flux. Here, we propose a particular spectral signature from individual remnants that is due to the energy-dependent escape from SNRs. For young and nearby sources, we predict fluxes enhanced by tens of percent in narrow rigidity intervals; given the percent-level flux uncertainties of contemporary cosmic-ray data, such features should be readily detectable. We model the spatial and temporal distribution of sources and the resulting distribution of fluxes with a Monte Carlo approach. The decision tree that we have trained on simulated data is able to discriminate with very high significance between the null hypothesis of a smooth distribution of sources and the scenario with a stochastic distribution of individual sources. We suggest that this cosmic-ray energy-dependent injection time (CREDIT) scenario be considered in experimental searches to identify individual SNRs as cosmic-ray sources.
