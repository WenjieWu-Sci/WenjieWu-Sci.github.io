2024-05-20, **Resonant Neutrino Flavor Conversion in the Atmosphere**, Connor Sponsler et.al., [2405.12140v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12140v1)

 Neutrinos produced in the atmosphere traverse a column density of air before being detected at neutrino observatories like IceCube or KM3NeT. In this work, we extend the neutrino flavor evolution in the {nuSQuIDS} code accounting for the varying height of neutrino production and the variable air density in the atmosphere. These effects can lead to sizeable spectral distortions in standard neutrino oscillations and are crucial to accurately describe some new physics scenarios. As an example, we study a model of quasi-sterile neutrinos that induce resonant flavor conversions at neutrino energies of ${O}(300)\text{ MeV}$ in matter densities of $1 \text{ g/cm}^3$. In atmospheric air densities, the same resonance is then realized at neutrino energies of ${O}(300- 700)$~GeV. We find that the new resonance can deplete the $\nu\_\mu + \overline{\nu}\_\mu$ flux at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory by as much as $10\%$ in the direction of the horizon.

2024-05-20, **Measurement of the absolute efficiency of the X-ARAPUCA photon detector for the DUNE Far Detector 1**, R. √Ålvarez-Garrote et.al., [2405.12014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12014v1)

 The Photon Detection System (PDS) of the first DUNE far detector (FD1) is composed of 6000 photon detection units, named X-ARAPUCA. The detection of the prompt light pulse generated by the particle energy release in liquid argon (LAr) will complement and boost the DUNE Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC). It will improve the non-beam events tagging and enable at low energies the trigger and the calorimetry of the supernova neutrinos. The X-ARAPUCA unit is an assembly of several components. Its Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) depends both on the design of the assembly, on the grade of the individual components and finally on their coupling. The X-ARAPUCA PDE is one of the leading parameters for the Photon Detection System sensitivity, that in turn determines the sensitivity of the DUNE for the detection of core-collapse supernova within the galaxy and for nucleon decay searches. In this work we present the final assessment of the absolute PDE of the FD1 X-ARAPUCA baseline design, measured in two laboratories with independent methods and setups. One hundred sixty units of these X-ARAPUCA devices have been deployed in the NP04 facility at the CERN Neutrino Platform, the 1:20 scale FD1 prototype, and will be operated during the year 2024. The assessed value of the PDE is a key parameter both in the NP04 and in the DUNE analysis and reconstruction studies.

2024-05-20, **Binary neutron star mergers as the source of the highest energy cosmic rays**, Glennys R. Farrar et.al., [2405.12004v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12004v1)

 We propose that ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are produced in binary neutron star mergers. Interpreting the highest energy events as r-process nuclei eliminates the need for exotic sources, while the observed near-universal maximum rigidity of ultrahigh energy sources can be understood as due to the uniformity of jets generated by the gravitationally-driven dynamo, given the narrow range of total binary neutron star masses. We discuss evidence for this scenario, and its prediction of coincidences between neutrinos above 10 PeV and gravitational waves.

2024-05-20, **Testing neutrino mass hierarchy under type-II seesaw scenario in $U(1)_X$ at colliders**, Arindam Das et.al., [2405.11820v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11820v1)

 The origin of tiny neutrino mass is a long standing unsolved puzzle of the Standard Model (SM) which allows us to consider scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) in a variety of ways. One of them being the gauge extension of the SM could be realized as in the form of an anomaly free, general $U(1)\_X$ extension of the SM where an $SU(2)\_L$ triplet scalar being charged under $U(1)\_X$ gauge group is introduced through a Dirac Yukawa coupling with the SM lepton doublet. Once the triplet scalar generates VEV, light neutrinos could acquire tiny Majorana mass and hence affecting the decay modes of the triplet scalar involving the neutrino oscillation data for different neutrino mass hierarchies. After the breaking of $U(1)\_X$ scenarios, a neutral BSM, neutral gauge boson $(Z^\prime)$ acquires mass which interact differently with the left and right handed fermions. Satisfying the recent LHC bounds on the triplet scalar and $Z^\prime$ production, we study the pair production of the triplet scalar at LHC, $e^-e^+$ and $\mu^-\mu^+$ colliders followed by its decay into dominant mode depending on the neutrino mass hierarchy. Generating the SM generic backgrounds, we study the possible signal significance of four lepton final states. We also compare our results with the purely SM gauge mediated triplet scalar pair production followed by four lepton final states which could be significant only in $\mu^- \mu^+$ collider.

2024-05-19, **Strong magnetic field inside degenerate relativistic plasma and the impacts on the neutrino transport in Core-Collapse Supernovae**, Yudong Luo et.al., [2405.11555v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11555v1)

 We study the impacts of magnetic field on the neutrino transport inside core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Magnetic field quantizes the momentum of electrons and positrons, resulting in the modification of weak-interaction cross sections and the chemical potentials of electrons and positrons. We include these changes in the leakage scheme of neutrino transport and perform 1D CCSN simulations with GR1D, assuming the postbounce magnetic field strength of $10^{16-17}$ G. The results show that the neutrino opacities are enhanced due to the amplified interaction rates, resulting in a larger neutrinosphere. This further reduces the peak value of neutrino luminosities and their decay rates since neutrinos stay longer inside the neutrinosphere. Meanwhile, the neutrino mean energies are smaller shortly after bounce and reach their peak values at later times. As these neutrino properties are crucial in subsequent nucleosynthesis processes, including the $\nu$p-process, $\nu$-process, and $r$-process, our findings suggest that the magnetic field may leave discernible marks on the abundance pattern of nucleosynthesis in CCSN.

2024-05-20, **CMB-HD as a Probe of Dark Matter on Sub-Galactic Scales**, Amanda MacInnis et.al., [2405.12220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12220v1)

 We show for the first time that high-resolution CMB lensing observations can probe structure on sub-galactic scales. In particular, a CMB-HD experiment can probe out to k ~ 55 h/Mpc, corresponding to halo masses of about $10^8 M\_{\odot}$. Over the range 0.005 h/Mpc < k < 55 h/Mpc, spanning four orders of magnitude, the total lensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the temperature, polarization, and lensing power spectra is greater than 1900. CMB-HD gains most of the lensing SNR at small scales from the temperature power spectrum, as opposed to the lensing spectrum. These lensing measurements allow CMB-HD to distinguish between cold dark matter (CDM) and non-CDM models that change the matter power spectrum on sub-galactic scales. We also find that CMB-HD can distinguish between baryonic feedback effects and non-CDM models due to the different way each impacts the lensing signal. The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) power spectrum further constrains non-CDM models that deviate from CDM on the smallest scales CMB-HD measures. For example, CMB-HD can detect 1 keV warm dark matter (WDM) at 30$\sigma$, or rule out about 7 keV WDM at 95% CL, in a $\Lambda$WDM + $N\_{\rm{eff}} + \sum m\_\nu + m\_{\rm{WDM}} + \log\_{10}T\_{\rm{AGN}} + A\_{\rm{kSZ}} + n\_{\rm{kSZ}}$ model; here $T\_{\rm{AGN}}$ characterizes the strength of the feedback, and $A\_{\rm{kSZ}}$ and $n\_{\rm{kSZ}}$ allow freedom in the amplitude and slope of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum. We make the CMB-HD Fisher code used here publicly available, and note that it can be modified to use any non-CDM model that changes the matter power spectrum.

2024-05-19, **Deflection of light by wormholes and its shadow due to dark matter within modified symmetric teleparallel gravity formalism**, G. Mustafa et.al., [2405.11576v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11576v1)

 We explore the possibility of traversable wormhole formation in the dark matter halos in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. We obtain the exact wormhole solutions with anisotropic matter source based on the Bose-Einstein condensate, Navarro-Frenk-White, and pseudo-isothermal matter density profiles. Notably, we present a novel wormhole solution supported by these dark matters using the expressions for the density profile and rotational velocity along with the modified field equations to calculate the redshift and shape functions of the wormholes. With a particular set of parameters, we demonstrate that our proposed wormhole solutions fulfill the flare-out condition against an asymptotic background. Additionally, we examine the energy conditions, focusing on the null energy conditions at the wormhole's throat, providing a graphical representation of the feasible and negative regions. Our study also examines the wormhole's shadow in the presence of various dark matter models, revealing that higher central densities result in a shadow closer to the throat, whereas lower values have the opposite effect. Moreover, we explore the deflection of light when it encounters these wormholes, particularly noting that light deflection approaches infinity at the throat, where the gravitational field is extremely strong.

2024-05-20, **The TRAPUM Small Magellanic Cloud pulsar survey with MeerKAT: I. Discovery of seven new pulsars and two Pulsar Wind Nebula associations**, E. Carli et.al., [2405.12029v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12029v1)

 The sensitivity of the MeerKAT radio interferometer is an opportunity to probe deeper into the population of rare and faint extragalactic pulsars. The TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with MeerKAT) collaboration has conducted a radio-domain search for accelerated pulsars and transients in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). This partially targeted survey, performed at L-band (856-1712 MHz) with the core array of the MeerKAT telescope in 2-h integrations, is twice as sensitive as the latest SMC radio pulsar survey. We report the discovery of seven new SMC pulsars, doubling this galaxy's radio pulsar population and increasing the total extragalactic population by nearly a quarter. We also carried out a search for accelerated millisecond pulsars in the SMC Globular Cluster NGC 121 using the full array of MeerKAT. This improved the previous upper limit on pulsed radio emission from this cluster by a factor of six. Our discoveries reveal the first radio pulsar-PWN systems in the SMC, with only one such system previously known outside our galaxy (the "Crab pulsar twin" in the Large Magellanic Cloud, PSR J0540$-$6919). We associate the 59 ms pulsar discovery PSR J0040$-$7337, now the fastest spinning radio pulsar in the SMC, with the bow-shock Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) of Supernova Remnant DEM S5. We also present a new young pulsar with a 79 ms period, PSR J0048$-$7317, in a PWN recently discovered in a MeerKAT radio continuum image. Using the multi-beam capability of MeerKAT, we localised our pulsar discoveries, and two previous Murriyang discoveries, to a positional uncertainty of a few arcseconds.

2024-05-20, **TRAPUM search for pulsars in supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae -- I. Survey description and initial discoveries**, J. D. Turner et.al., [2405.11899v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11899v1)

 We present the description and initial results of the TRAPUM (TRAnsients And PUlsars with MeerKAT) search for pulsars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs), pulsar wind nebulae and unidentified TeV emission. The list of sources to be targeted includes a large number of well-known candidate pulsar locations but also new candidate SNRs identified using a range of criteria. Using the 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope, we use an interferometric beamforming technique to tile the potential pulsar locations with coherent beams which we search for radio pulsations, above a signal-to-noise of 9, down to an average flux density upper limit of 30 $\mu$Jy. This limit is target-dependent due to the contribution of the sky and nebula to the system temperature. Coherent beams are arranged to overlap at their 50 per cent power radius, so the sensitivity to pulsars is not degraded by more than this amount, though realistically averages around 65 per cent if every location in the beam is considered. We report the discovery of two new pulsars; PSR J1831$-$0941 is an adolescent pulsar likely to be the plerionic engine of the candidate PWN G20.0+0.0, and PSR J1818$-$1502 appears to be an old and faint pulsar that we serendipitously discovered near the centre of a SNR already hosting a compact central object. The survey holds importance for better understanding of neutron star birth rates and the energetics of young pulsars.

2024-05-20, **DESI constraints on varying electron mass model and axion-like early dark energy**, Osamu Seto et.al., [2405.11869v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11869v1)

 Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) is one of the important standard ruler in cosmology. The results of the latest BAO measurements by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey has been reported. Cosmology with the varying electron mass model and the early dark energy (EDE) models are regraded as interesting models to resolve the Hubble tension. We present constraints on the varying electron mass model and EDE models by including new DESI data as well as cosmic microwave background by Planck and the conventional BAO data from 6dF, MGS, and DR12 and supernovae light curve data into analysis. Since new DESI BAO data indicates slightly longer sound horizon $r\_dh$ than the other BAO observations, for the varying electron mass model, the larger $H\_0 =69.44\pm 0.84 $ km$/$s$/$Mpc is indicated.

2024-05-20, **Growth of cosmic perturbations in the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity**, Mahnaz Asghari et.al., [2405.11840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11840v1)

 We explore the generalized $f(R,T)$ modified theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We derive modified field equations to the linear order of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ model. We then investigate the growth of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. Primary numerical investigations based on matter power spectra diagrams indicates a structure growth suppression in $f(R,T)$ gravity, which exhibits consistency with local measurements. Also, we notice that matter-geometry interaction in $f(R,T)$ model would results in the specific feature named as "matter acoustic oscillations" appeared in matter power spectra diagrams. Moreover, we put constraints on the cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$ model, utilizing current observations, chiefly cosmic microwave background (CMB), weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and redshift-space distortions (RSD) data. Numerical results based on MCMC calculations imply that $f(R,T)$ is a qualified theory of modified gravity in reconciling Planck CMB data with local probes of large scale structures, by reporting lower values for the structure growth parameter $\sigma\_8$ compared to the standard model of cosmology.

2024-05-20, **The Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Reverberation Mapping Project: Initial Results for a candidate IMBH in a nearby Seyfert 1 Galaxy**, Wenwen Zuo et.al., [2405.11750v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11750v1)

 To investigate the short-term variability and determine the size of the optical continuum emitting size of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), we carried out high-cadence, multi-band photometric monitoring of a Seyfert 1 galaxy J0249-0815 across two nights, together with a one-night single-band preliminary test. The presence of the broad Ha component in our target was confirmed by recent Palomar/P200 spectroscopic observations, 23 years after Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ruling out the supernovae origin of the broad Ha line. The photometric experiment was primarily conducted utilizing four-channel imagers MuSCAT 3 & 4 mounted on 2-meter telescopes within the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Despite the expectation of variability, we observed no significant variation (<1.4%) on timescales of 6-10 hours. This non-detection is likely due to substantial host galaxy light diluting the subtle AGN variability. Dual-band preliminary tests and tailored simulations may enhance the possibility of detecting variability and lag in future IMBH reverberation campaigns.
