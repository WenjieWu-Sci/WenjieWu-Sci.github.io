2025-03-17, **Non-cyclic prototype of JUNO-TAO VETO water tank with 3 inch PMTs**, Ziming Li et.al., [2503.13249v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13249v1)

 The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO, also known as JUNO-TAO) is a satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). A ton-level liquid scintillator detector will be placed at about 30 m from a core of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant. The reactor antineutrino spectrum will be measured with sub-percent energy resolution, to provide a reference spectrum for future reactor neutrino experiments, and to provide a benchmark measurement to test nuclear databases. A Cerenkov water tank system with a thickness of 1.2 m pure water will be located around the central detector of TAO. The water tank system designed with 300 3" PMTs (SPMT) will use the same electronics as JUNO SPMT, but with online software multiplicity trigger. The performance of a Cerenkov detector with the JUNO SPMT and electronics designed for liquid scintillator detector needs to be checked, including the software triggering. The features and the long stability of the detector without water circulation also needs to be checked as a common concern and a backup option for future JUNO-TAO running. Here we will summary the integration and testing of a prototype water tank detector system, including SPMT, electronics, data taking, simulation and measurement results.

 Precision spectroscopy of the electron spectrum of the tritium $\beta$-decay near the kinematic endpoint is a direct method to determine the effective electron antineutrino mass. The KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment aims to determine this quantity with a sensitivity of better than 0.3$\,$eV (90$\,$% C.L.). An inhomogeneous electric potential in the tritium source of KATRIN can lead to distortions of the $\beta$-spectrum, which directly impact the neutrino-mass observable. This effect can be quantified through precision spectroscopy of the conversion-electrons of co-circulated metastable $^{83m}$Kr. Therefore, dedicated, several-weeks long measurement campaigns have been performed within the KATRIN data taking schedule. In this work, we infer the tritium source potential observables from these measurements, and present their implications for the neutrino-mass determination.

2025-03-17, **3+1 neutrino mixings model with $A_4$ triplet Majorana neutrino**, Mayengbam Kishan Singh et.al., [2503.13124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13124v1)

 We study a 3+1 active-sterile neutrino mixings model using an $A\_4$ triplet right-handed neutrino $\nu\_R$ and a singlet eV-scale sterile neutrino under $A\_4\times Z\_3 \times Z\_2$ discrete symmetry. Four scalar flavons are considered to reproduce neutrino oscillation parameters within the experimental 3$\sigma$ range. The model also studies the effective mass parameter in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. Deviation from $\mu-\tau$ symmetry in the active neutrino mass matrix is generated through an antisymmetric interaction of $\nu\_R$. This model successfully explains active-sterile neutrino mixings consistent with the cosmological upper bound on the sum of active neutrino mass $\sum m\_i < 0.113$ eV (0.145 eV) in NH(IH).

2025-03-17, **Estimating the Sensitivity of IceCube-Gen2 to Cosmic Ray Mass Separation**, Manisha Lohan et.al., [2503.13117v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13117v1)

 IceCube-Gen2 is a proposed extension to the existing IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole. It will consist of three components: an in-ice optical array, a surface array on top of the optical array, and a radio array for detecting ultra-high energy neutrinos. Here we study the sensitivity of this future detector to the mass separation of primary cosmic rays, using CORSIKA Monte Carlo simulations of extensive air showers initiated by H, He, O and Fe primaries. The surface array will use two types of detection technologies: scintillation detectors and radio antennas; the latter are not considered in this study. A set of mass-sensitive variables are investigated utilizing both the scintillators of the surface array and the full optical in-ice array. Among these, the high-energy muons measurable by the in-ice array are found to have the highest mass separation power for showers for which the cosmic-ray energy is known, e.g. from the surface array.

2025-03-17, **Neutrino Decoherence in \texorpdfstring{\(κ\)}{kappa}-Minkowski Quantum Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Paradigm**, Partha Nandi et.al., [2503.13061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061v1)

 We investigate neutrino decoherence within the framework of quantum spacetime, focusing on the $\kappa$-Minkowski model. We show that stochastic fluctuations in quantum spacetime induce an energy-dependent decoherence effect, where the decoherence rate scales as $E^{-4}$. This result aligns with recent IceCube observations, indicating that quantum gravity does not induce significant decoherence for high-energy neutrinos. Additionally, we establish conditions under which quantum spacetime effects could influence relic neutrinos, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results shed light on how quantum spacetime fluctuations impact neutrino oscillation physics.

2025-03-17, **Exploring Physics beyond the Standard Model with Neutrinos**, Rukmani Mohanta et.al., [2503.12985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12985v1)

 Neutrinos, being elusive subatomic particles having only weak interactions, provide an ideal platform to look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present era of neutrino physics, various experiments are focusing towards the precision measurements of the oscillation parameters. Hence, various new physics scenarios which can affect the neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter, be in need of careful investigation. There is a slight tension at the level of $2 \sigma$ between the recently reported results on the CP violating phase $\delta\_{CP}$ by NOvA and T2K experiments, which can be attributed to the role of non-standard interactions (NSIs) in the propagation of neutrinos through matter. Another interesting possibility is that though neutrinos are electrically neutral, they can possess electromagnetic properties such as electric and magnetic dipole moments in the presence of new physics, and the neutrino oscillation experiments can put limits on them. In this work, we will focus on these two aspects and show how they can be used to probe the nature of new physics from model-building perspectives.

2025-03-17, **On matching galaxy number densities to reconstruct galaxy evolutionary tracks**, Aldo Rodriguez-Puebla et.al., [2503.13348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13348v1)

 The cumulative number density matching approach equates number densities between adjacent redshifts to derive empirical galaxy evolution tracks from the observed galaxy stellar mass function. However, it is well known that this approach overlooks scatter in mass assembly histories and merger effects, with previous studies relying on model-based corrections, either from hydrodynamical cosmological simulations or adjustments to the evolution of cumulative number density with redshift. Here, we revisit this approach, showing that dark matter halo assembly histories imply evolving number densities that are far from constant. These exhibit an average slope of $d \log n\_\text{vir} /dz \sim 0.2$ dex for progenitors at $z=0$, leading to evolutionary tracks where galaxies are $\sim2-3$ times smaller in mass at $z\sim2$ and an order of magnitude smaller by $z\sim7$ compared to the number density matching approach. We show that evolving halo number densities provide realistic evolutionary tracks without relying on model-based corrections. Accounting for random errors in stellar mass measurements is also crucial for robust track derivation. We also discuss a generalization that incorporates a galaxy's star formation activity. When additionally considering the scatter around the $M\_\ast-M\_\text{vir}$ relation ($\sim0.15$ dex), our evolving halo cumulative number density approach shows that some observed stellar masses, $M\_{\text{obs},\ast}$, can exceed the universal baryon fraction $f\_\text{bar}\sim0.16$. For instance, at $z=5$, around $2\%$ of progenitor galaxies of haloes with $M\_\text{vir} \sim 3\times 10^{12}\,M\_\odot$ have $M\_{\text{obs},\ast}>f\_\text{bar} \; M\_\text{vir}$, suggesting a potential ``early galaxy formation problem''. However, when deconvolving mass from random errors this tension is reduced with significant confidence at the $\sim5-6\sigma$ level.

2025-03-17, **Constraining the parameters of heavy dark matter and memory-burdened primordial black holes with DAMPE electron measurements**, Tian-Ci Liu et.al., [2503.13192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13192v1)

 The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space-based instrument for detecting GeV-TeV cosmic rays and gamma rays. High-energy cosmic rays could be emitted from several dark matter candidates theoretically, such as the heavy dark matter (HDM) and the primordial black holes (PBHs). HDM particles with a mass of $>100\,{\rm TeV}$ could decay into $\gtrsim 10\,{\rm TeV}$ electron/positron pairs. PBHs with a mass of $\lesssim 10^{10}\,{\rm g}$ would survive to the present day if the Hawking radiation is significantly suppressed due to the memory burden effect and can also lead to the emission of $\gtrsim 10\,{\rm TeV}$ electrons. In this work, we use the DAMPE electron measurements to obtain the constraints on the decay lifetime $\tau$ of HDM and the entropy index $k$ of memory-burdened PBHs at $95 \%$ confidence level. The constraints on the fraction $f\_{\rm PBH}$ are also derived with a fixed $k$. Furthermore, the high-energy tail of the DAMPE electron spectrum shows a sign of going upwards, possibly suggesting the presence of an additional component; we discuss if this spectral behavior is real, which parameter space is required for it to be attributed to HDM or PBH. We will show that the required parameters have been constrained by existing limits.

2025-03-17, **RelExt: A New Dark Matter Tool for the Exploration of Dark Matter Models**, Rodrigo Capucha et.al., [2503.13087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13087v1)

 We present the {\tt C++} program \texttt{RelExt} for Standard Model (SM) extensions that feature a Dark Matter (DM) candidate. The tool allows to efficiently scan the parameter spaces of these models to find parameter combinations that lead to relic density values which are compatible with the measured value within the uncertainty specified by the user. The code computes the relic density for freeze-out (co-)annihilation processes. The user can choose between several pre-installed models or any arbitrary other model featuring a discrete $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ symmetry, by solely providing the corresponding \texttt{FeynRules} model files. The code automatically generates the required (co-)annihilation amplitudes and thermally averaged cross sections, including the total widths in the $s$-channel mediators, and solves the Boltzmann equation to determine the relic density. It can easily be linked to other tools like e.g.~\texttt{ScannerS} to check for the relevant theoretical and experimental constraints, or to \texttt{BSMPT} to investigate the phase history of the model and possibly related gravitational waves signals.

2025-03-17, **Does finetuning make $D$-term contributions smaller in natural grand unified theories with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking?**, Nobuhiro Maekawa et.al., [2503.12881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12881v1)

 In this paper, we explore the natural grand unified theory (GUT) with spontaneous supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking, focusing on the contribution to sfermion and Higgs masses. Natural GUTs solve various problems in SUSY GUTs with the natural assumption that all terms allowed by $SO(10)\times U(1)\_A$ symmetry are introduced with $O(1)$ coefficients. %, solve various the problems in SUSY GUTs. It is also possible to introduce spontaneous SUSY breaking in the natural GUT. This scenario predicts $D$-term contribution to sfermion and Higgs masses dominates the $F$-term contribution, that potentially leads to the SUSY flavor problem. Fortunately, it also predicts high-scale SUSY, which avoids the SUSY flavor problem but leads to the instability of the %need for fine-tuning to obtain the electroweak scale. The $D$-term domination results in the superheavy Higgsino unless the $D$-term contribution becomes comparable with the $F$-term contribution. We discuss whether it is possible to suppress the $D$-term contribution while maintaining the $F$-term contribution through the tuning of $O(1)$ coefficients in the natural GUT with spontaneous SUSY breaking. Our results indicate that it is impossible. %the D-term is proportional to the F-term and its derivatives, making it difficult to suppress the D-term independently. This also suggests that the mass spectrum of the sfermions can be predicted by the $D$-term contributions, and that the Higgsino is not a candidate for dark matter in the scenario.

2025-03-17, **Contribution to the Radio Light Curves of a Core-Collapse Supernova due to the Off-axis Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow**, Yo Kusafuka et.al., [2503.13291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13291v1)

 We present the first comprehensive theoretical predictions of radio emission from a Type Ic-BL supernova (SN) associated with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet. It is naturally supposed that the expected radio light curve consists of two components of emitting source: radio emission from a non-relativistic SN shock and afterglow emitted from the head of the relativistic GRB jet. We calculate each component of radio emission, placing an emphasis on surveying wide ranges of isotropic explosion energy and viewing angle in our GRB afterglow modeling. We show that in particular parameter space, the composite radio light curve would be characterized by a double-peaked shape. The condition for the clear appearance of the double-peaked radio light curve is either (1) the isotropic explosion energy is small (low-luminosity GRB) or (2) the viewing angle is large (off-axis GRB). Our results highlight that follow-up radio observations conducted within a few years after the optical discovery of nearby Type Ic-BL supernovae ($\sim$100~Mpc) can serve as a unique diagnostic for off-axis GRBs undiscovered in Type IcBL SNe. This will be a step toward uncovering the nature of long GRB progenitors and clarifying their connection to Type IcBL SNe.

2025-03-17, **Reconstructing the dark energy density in light of DESI BAO observations**, Maria Berti et.al., [2503.13198v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13198v1)

 In light of the evidence for dynamical dark energy (DE) found from the most recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, we perform a non-parametric, model-independent reconstruction of the DE density evolution. To do so, we develop and validate a new framework that reconstructs the DE density through a third-degree piece-wise polynomial interpolation, allowing for direct constraints on its redshift evolution without assuming any specific functional form. The strength of our approach resides in the choice of directly reconstructing the DE density, which provides a more straightforward relation to the distances measured by BAO than the equation of state parameter. We investigate the constraining power of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations combined with supernovae (SNe) and BAO measurements. In agreement with results from other works, we find a preference for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, with a significance of $2.4\sigma$ when using the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) SNe data, and $1.3\sigma$ with PantheonPlus. In all the cases we consider, the derived DE equation of state parameter presents evidence for phantom crossing. By investigating potential systematic effects in the low-redshift samples of DESY5 observations, we confirm that correcting for the offset in apparent magnitude with respect to PantheonPlus data, as suggested in previous studies, completely removes the tension. Furthermore, we assess the risk of potentially overfitting the data by changing the number of interpolation nodes. As expected, we find that with lesser nodes we get a smoother reconstructed behavior of the DE density, although with similar overall features. The pipeline developed in this work is ready to be used with future high-precision data to further investigate the evidence for a non-standard background evolution.

2025-03-17, **A slowly pulsating run-away B star at high Galactic latitude ejected from a spiral arm**, Ulrich Heber et.al., [2503.13095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13095v1)

 We report the discovery of the young B6V run-away star LAMOST J083323.18+430825.4, 2.5\,kpc above the Galactic plane. Its atmospheric parameters and chemical composition are determined from LAMOST spectra, indicating normal composition. Effective temperature (Teff=14,500) and gravity (log g=3.79) suggest that the star is close to terminating hydrogen burning. An analysis of the spectral energy distribution allowed us to determine the angular diameter as well as the interstellar reddening. Using evolutionary models from the MIST database we derived the stellar mass (4.75Msun) and age (104^+11\_-13 Myr). The spectroscopic distance (4.17 kpc), the radius (4.5 Rsun), and the luminosity (log(L/Lsun)=2.89) then result from the atmospheric parameters. Using Gaia proper motions, the trajectory is traced back to the Galactic disk to identify the place of birth in a spiral arm. The ejection velocity of 92 km s^{-1} is typical for runaway stars in the halo. The age of the star is larger than its time of flight (78+-4 Myr), which favors a binary supernova event as the likely ejection mechanism. The TESS light curve shows variations with a period of 3.58 days from which we conclude that it is a slowly pulsating B-star, one of very few run-away B-stars known to pulsate.

2025-03-17, **Using chemical evolution models of the Milky Way disk to constrain Type Ia supernova progenitors**, T. C. L. Trueman et.al., [2503.13024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13024v1)

 Thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a significant role in the galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of the Milky Way. However, a long-standing and as yet unresolved problem of modern astrophysics concerns the identity of their progenitor. We aim to use GCE predictions to help constrain potential SN Ia progenitor scenarios, since it is well known that SN Ia nucleosynthesis yields, in particular the Fe-peak elements, depend on the explosion mechanism. We calculated 1140 GCE models and compared the GCE-predicted abundance ratios for four different SN Ia explosion mechanisms -- two from sub-Chandrasekhar (MCh) mass progenitors and two from near-MCh mass progenitors -- to spectroscopic measurements of Milky Way disk stars, considering both local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE (NLTE) assumptions. We calibrated the GCE framework for two sets of massive star yields in order to assess how stellar modelling uncertainties affect the relative contribution from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) towards Si, Ca, and the Fe-peak elements. From a GCE perspective, Si and Ca cannot be used to constrain SN Ia progenitors since there is little variation in their yields between different explosion types. The GCE of [Ti/Fe] and [Co/Fe] are not reproduced by any combination of yields. The [Cr/Fe] ratio is also problematic, since hardly any NLTE data of the disk are available and there are conflicting yields from CCSNe. For [Mn/Fe], neither CCSN yield set are compatible with the NLTE data. For [Ni/Fe], the NLTE data are well fit by one set of CCSN yields, with the best-fitting GCE models having a $\sim85\%$ contribution from sub-MCh SNe Ia. We advise caution when using GCE models to constrain the Galaxy's SN Ia population, since the results depend on both the choice of CCSN yields and the elemental ratio used as a diagnostic.

2025-03-17, **The nebular spectra of SN 2023ixf: A lower mass, partially stripped progenitor may be the result of binary interaction**, Philip D. Michel et.al., [2503.13017v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13017v1)

 SN 2023ixf is one of the brightest Core Collapse Supernovae of the 21st century and offers a rare opportunity to investigate the late stage of a Supernova through nebular phase spectroscopy. We present four nebular phase spectra from day +291 to +413 after explosion. This is supplemented with high cadence early phase spectroscopic observations and photometry covering the first 500 days to investigate explosion parameters. The narrow and blue-shifted nebular Oxygen emission lines are used to infer an ejected Oxygen mass of $<0.65M\_\odot$, consistent with models of a relatively low mass ($M\_{ZAMS}<15M\_\odot$) progenitor. An energy of 0.3 to $1.4 \times10^{51}$ erg and a light curve powered by an initial $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.049 \pm 0.005 M\_\odot$ appear consistent with a relatively standard Type II explosion, while an incomplete $\gamma$-ray trapping (with timescale of $240\pm4$ days) suggests a lower ejecta mass. Assuming a typical explosion, the broad Hydrogen and Calcium profiles suggest a common origin within a lower mass, partially stripped envelope. Hydrogen emission broadens with time, indicating contribution from an additional power source at an extended distance; while the emergence of high velocity ($\sim$6,000 km s$^{-1}$) Hydrogen emission features (beginning around day +200) may be explained by Shock Interaction with a dense Hydrogen-rich region located at $\sim1.5 \times 10^{16}$cm. Such envelope mass loss for a low mass progenitor may be explained through theoretical models of Binary interaction.

2025-03-17, **SISSI: Supernovae in a stratified, shearing interstellar medium -- I. The geometry of supernova remnants**, Leonard E. C. Romano et.al., [2503.12977v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12977v1)

 Aims. We introduce the SISSI (Supernovae In a Stratified, Shearing Interstellar medium) simulation suite, which aims to enable a more comprehensive understanding of supernova remnants (SNRs) evolving in a complex interstellar medium (ISM) structured under the influence of galactic rotation, gravity and turbulence. Methods. We utilize zoom-in simulations of 30 SNRs expanding in the ISM of a simulated isolated disk galaxy. The ISM of the galaxy is resolved down to a maximum resolution of $\sim 12\,\text{pc}$, while we achieve a zoomed-in resolution of $\sim 0.18\, \text{pc}$ in the vicinity of the explosion sources. We compute the time-evolution of the SNRs' geometry and compare it to the observed geometry of the Local Bubble. Results. During the early stages of evolution, SNRs are well described by existing analytical models. On longer timescales, starting at about a percent of the orbital timescale, they depart from spherical symmetry and become increasingly prolate or oblate. The timescale for the departure from spherical symmetry is shorter than the expectation from a simple model for the deformation by galactic shear, suggesting that galactic shear alone cannot explain these differences. Yet, the alignment of the minor- and major axis of the SNRs is in line with expectations from said model, indicating that the deformation might have a shear-related origin. A comparison with the geometry of the Local Bubble reveals that it might be slightly younger than previously believed, but otherwise has a standard morphology for a SNR of its age and size. Conclusions. Studying the geometry of SNRs can reveal valuable insights about the complex interactions shaping their dynamical evolution. Future studies targeting the geometry of Galactic SNRs may use this insight to obtain a clearer picture of the processes shaping the Galactic ISM.

2025-03-17, **JWST/MIRI detects the dusty SN1993J about 30 years after explosion**, Tamás Szalai et.al., [2503.12950v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12950v1)

 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have long been considered to contribute significantly to the cosmic dust budget. New dust cools quickly and is therefore detectable at mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths. However, before the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), direct observational evidence for dust condensation was found in only a handful of nearby CCSNe, and dust masses (~10$^{-2}-10^{-3} M\_{\odot}$, generally limited to <5 yr and to >500K temperatures) have been 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than either theoretical predictions or dust amounts found by far-IR/submm observations of Galactic SN remnants and in the very nearby SN 1987A. The combined angular resolution and mid-IR sensitivity of JWST finally allow us to reveal hidden cool (~100-200K) dust reservoirs in extragalactic SNe beyond SN 1987A. Our team received JWST/MIRI time for studying a larger sample of CCSNe to fill the currently existing gap in their dust formation histories. The first observed target of this program is the well-known Type IIb SN~1993J appeared in M81. We generated its spectral energy distribution (SED) from the current JWST/MIRI F770W, F1000W, F1500W, and F2100W fluxes. We fit single- and two-component silicate and carbonaceous dust models to the SED. We found that SN 1993J still contains a significant amount (~0.01 $M\_{\odot}$) of dust ~30 yr after explosion. Comparing these results to those of the analysis of earlier {Spitzer Space Telescope data, we see a similar amount of dust now that was detected ~15-20 yr ago, but at a lower temperature. We also find residual background emission near the SN site (after point-spread-function subtraction on the JWST/MIRI images) that may plausibly be attributed to an IR echo from more distant interstellar dust grains heated by the SN shock-breakout luminosity or ongoing star formation in the local environment.

2025-03-17, **Probing the cosmic baryon distribution and the impact of AGN feedback with FRBs in CROCODILE simulation**, Zhao Joseph Zhang et.al., [2503.12741v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12741v1)

 We investigate the Missing Baryon problem using Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to trace cosmic baryons. We use the CROCODILE simulations with the GADGET3/4-OSAKA SPH code, incorporating star formation, supernova (SN), and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Light cones generated from large-scale structure simulations allow us to compute gas density profiles and dispersion measures (DMs) measurable by FRBs. Our results show that AGN feedback reduces central gas densities in halos, reshaping the boundary between the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). Zoom-in simulations further reveal that AGN feedback significantly modulates foreground halo DM contributions along different sightlines. By analyzing the DM--redshift (DM--z) relation and comparing it to the Macquart relation, we constrain the diffuse baryon mass fraction at z = 1 to fdiff = 0.865 (+0.101, -0.165) (fiducial) and fdiff = 0.856 (+0.101, -0.162) (NoBH), including IGM (fIGM) and halo (fHalos) contributions. We also quantify the redshift evolution of fdiff and fIGM, providing the fitting results. Our study provides a framework for understanding baryon distribution across cosmic structures, FRB host galaxies, and the role of AGN in shaping foreground DM contributions.
