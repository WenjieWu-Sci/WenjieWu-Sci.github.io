2024-04-02, **Detecting Gravitational Wave Memory in the Next Galactic Core-Collapse Supernova**, Colter J. Richardson et.al., [2404.02131v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02131v1)

 We present an approach to detecting (linear) gravitational wave memory in a Galactic core-collapse supernova using current interferometers. Gravitational wave memory is an important prediction of general relativity that has yet to be confirmed. Our approach uses a combination of Linear Prediction Filtering and Matched-Filtering. We present the results of our approach on data from core-collapse supernova simulations that span a range of progenitor mass and metallicity. We are able to detect gravitational wave memory out to 10 kpc. We also present the False Alarm Probabilities assuming an On-Source Window compatible with the presence of a neutrino detection.

2024-04-02, **High-energy neutrinos flavour composition as a probe of neutrino magnetic moments**, Artem Popov et.al., [2404.02027v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02027v1)

 Neutrino propagation in the Galactic magnetic field is considered. To describe neutrino flavour and spin oscillations on the galactic scale baselines an approach using wave packets is developed. Evolution equations for the neutrino wave packets in a uniform and non-uniform magnetic field are derived. Analytical expressions for neutrino flavour and spin oscillations probabilities accounting for damping due to wave packet separation are obtained for the case of uniform magnetic field. It is shown that for oscillations on magnetic frequencies $\omega\_i^B = \mu\_i B\_\perp$ the coherence lengths that characterizes the damping scale is proportional to the cube of neutrino average momentum $p\_0^3$. Probabilities of flavour and spin oscillations are calculated numerically for neutrino interacting with the non-uniform Galactic magnetic field. Flavour compositions of high-energy neutrino flux coming from the Galactic centre are calculated accounting for neutrino interaction with the magnetic field. It is shown that for neutrino magnetic moments $\sim 10^{-13} \mu\_B$ and larger these flavour compositions significantly differ from ones predicted by the vacuum neutrino oscillations scenario.

2024-04-02, **Particle Creation in a Linear Gravitational Wave Background**, Tanmoy Chakraborty et.al., [2404.01840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01840v1)

 Inspired by Leonard Parker's pioneering 1968 work demonstrating matter quanta production in a dynamical spacetime background, we consider production of scalar quanta in a gravitational wave background. Choosing the spacetime to be a flat spacetime perturbed linearly by a spherical plane gravitational wave, we show that scalar particles may indeed be produced in a perturbative manner. Our formulation is valid for any linear gravitational wave background profile, and should generalize straightforwardly to production of massless elementary particles of diverse species (photons, neutrinos). In this aspect, irrespective of the astrophysical nature of the binary merger sourcing the gravitational wave signal, one expects the dynamical nature of the spacetime to produce all species of light particles. Thus, any binary coalescence is in effect a source of multimessenger astrophysics.

2024-04-02, **A thermionic electron gun to characterize silicon drift detectors with electrons**, Korbinian Urban et.al., [2404.01777v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01777v1)

 The TRISTAN detector is a new detector for electron spectroscopy at the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment. The semiconductor detector utilizes the silicon drift detector technology and will enable the precise measurement of the entire tritium beta decay electron spectrum. Thus, a significant fraction of the parameter space of potential neutrino mass eigenstates in the keV-mass regime can be probed. We developed a custom electron gun based on the effect of thermionic emission to characterize the TRISTAN detector modules with mono-energetic electrons before installation into the KATRIN beamline. The electron gun provides an electron beam with up to 25 keV kinetic energy and an electron rate in the order of 1E5 electrons per second. This manuscript gives an overview of the design and commissioning of the electron gun. In addition, we will shortly discuss a first measurement with the electron gun to characterize the electron response of the TRISTAN detector.

2024-04-02, **Diagnostics of 3D explosion asymmetries of stripped-envelope supernovae by nebular line profiles**, Bart van Baal et.al., [2404.01763v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01763v1)

 Understanding the explosion mechanism and hydrodynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae is a long-standing quest in astronomy. The asymmetries caused by the explosion are encoded into the line profiles which appear in the nebular phase of the SN evolution -- with particularly clean imprints in He star explosions. Here, we carry out nine different supernova simulations of He-core progenitors, exploding them in 3D with parametrically varied neutrino luminosities using the $\texttt{Prometheus-HotB}$ code, hydrodynamically evolving the models to the homologeous phase. We then compute nebular phase spectra with the 3D NLTE spectral synthesis code $\texttt{ExTraSS}$ (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator). We study how line widths and shifts depend on progenitor mass, explosion energy, and viewing angle. We compare the predicted line profile properties against a large set of Type Ib observations, and discuss the degree to which current neutrino-driven explosions can match observationally inferred asymmetries. With self-consistent 3D modelling -- circumventing the difficulties of representing $^{56}$Ni mixing and clumping accurately in 1D models -- we find that neither low-mass He cores exploding with high energies nor high-mass cores exploding with low energies contribute to the Type Ib SN population. Models which have line profile widths in agreement with this population give sufficiently large centroid shifts for calcium emission lines. Calcium is more strongly affected by explosion asymmetries connected to the neutron star kicks than oxygen and magnesium. Lastly, we turn to the NIR spectra from our models to investigate the potential of using this regime to look for the presence of He in the nebular phase.

2024-04-02, **Search for a sub-eV sterile neutrino using Daya Bay's full dataset**, F. P. An et.al., [2404.01687v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01687v1)

 This Letter presents results of a search for the mixing of a sub-eV sterile neutrino based on the full data sample of the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment, collected during 3158 days of detector operation, which contains $5.55 \times 10^{6}$ reactor \anue candidates identified as inverse beta-decay interactions followed by neutron-capture on gadolinium. The result was obtained in the minimally extended 3+1 neutrino mixing model. The analysis benefits from a doubling of the statistics of our previous result and from improvements of several important systematic uncertainties. The results are consistent with the standard three-neutrino mixing model and no significant signal of a sub-eV sterile neutrino was found. Exclusion limits are set by both Feldman-Cousins and CLs methods. Light sterile neutrino mixing with $\sin^2 2\theta\_{14} \gtrsim 0.01$ can be excluded at 95\% confidence level in the region of $0.01$ eV$^2 \lesssim \|\Delta m^{2}\_{41}\| \lesssim 0.1 $ eV$^2$. This result represents the world-leading constraints in the region of $2 \times 10^{-4}$ eV$^2 \lesssim \|\Delta m^{2}\_{41}\| \lesssim 0.2 $ eV$^2$.

2024-04-01, **A Semi-blind Reconstruction of the History of Effective Number of Neutrinos Using CMB Data**, Sarah Safi et.al., [2404.01457v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01457v1)

 We explore the possibility of redshift-dependent deviations in the contribution of relativistic degrees of freedom to the radiation budget of the cosmos, conventionally parameterized by the effective number of neutrinos $N\_{\rm eff}$, from the predictions of the standard model. We expand the deviations $\Delta N\_{\rm eff}(z)$ in terms of top-hat functions and treat their amplitudes as the free parameters of the theory to be measured alongside the standard cosmological parameters by the Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, as well as performing forecasts for futuristic CMB surveys such as PICO and CMB-S4. We reconstruct the history of $\Delta N\_{\rm eff}$ and find that with the current data the history is consistent with the standard scenario. Inclusion of the new degrees of freedom in the analysis increases $H\_0$ to $68.71\pm 0.44$, slightly reducing the Hubble tension. With the smaller forecasted errors on the $\Delta N\_{\rm eff}(z)$ parametrization modes from future CMB surveys, very accurate bounds are expected within the possible range of dark radiation models.

2024-04-01, **Flavour bounds on axions, hidden photons and sterile neutrinos**, Martin Bauer et.al., [2404.01095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01095v1)

 Flavour-violating decays are some of the most sensitive probes for New Physics with masses below the B meson threshold. In this talk I review the sensitivity to axion-like particles, hidden photons and heavy neutral leptons assuming minimal models where these are the only particle in addition to the Standard Model, respectively.

2024-04-02, **Tightening the reins on non-minimal dark sector physics: Interacting Dark Energy with dynamical and non-dynamical equation of state**, William Giar√® et.al., [2404.02110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02110v1)

 We present a comprehensive reassessment of the state of Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) cosmology, namely models featuring a non-gravitational interaction between Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). To achieve high generality, we extend the dark sector physics by considering two different scenarios: a non-dynamical DE equation of state $w\_0\neq-1$, and a dynamical $w(a)=w\_0+w\_a(1-a)$. In both cases, we distinguish two different physical regimes resulting from a phantom or quintessence equation of state. To circumvent early-time superhorizon instabilities, the energy-momentum transfer should occur in opposing directions within the two regimes, resulting in distinct phenomenological outcomes. We study quintessence and phantom non-dynamical and dynamical models in light of two independent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments - the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We analyze CMB data both independently and in combination with Supernovae (SN) distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon-Plus catalog and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Our results update and extend the state-of-the-art analyses, significantly narrowing the parameter space allowed for these models and limiting their overall ability to reconcile cosmological tensions. Although considering different combinations of data leaves some freedom to increase $H\_0$ towards the value measured by the SH0ES collaboration, our most constraining dataset (CMB+BAO+SN) indicates that fully reconciling the tension solely within the framework of IDE remains challenging.

2024-04-02, **Testing Yukawa cosmology at the Milky Way and M31 galactic scales**, Rocco D'Agostino et.al., [2404.01846v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01846v1)

 We address the galaxy rotation curves through the Yukawa gravitational potential emerging as a correction of the Newtonian potential in extended theories of gravity. On the one hand, we consider the contribution of the galactic bulge, galactic disk, and the dark matter halo of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, in the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. On the other hand, we use modified Yukawa gravity to show that the rotational velocity of galaxies can be addressed successfully without the need for dark matter. In Yukawa gravity, we recover MOND and show that dark matter might be seen as an apparent effect due to the modification of the law of gravitation in terms of two parameters: the coupling constant $\alpha $ and the characteristic length $\lambda$. We thus test our theoretical scenario using the Milky Way and M31 rotation velocity curves. In particular, we place observational constraints on the free parameters of Yukawa cosmology through the Monte Carlo method and then compare our results with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by making use of Bayesian information criteria. Specifically, we find that $\lambda$ is constrained to be of the order of kpc, while cosmological data suggest $\lambda$ of the order of Gpc. To explain this discrepancy, we argue that there is a fundamental limitation in measuring $\lambda$ due to the role of quantum mechanics on cosmological scales.

2024-04-02, **CSST Strong Lensing Preparation: a Framework for Detecting Strong Lenses in the Multi-color Imaging Survey by the China Survey Space Telescope (CSST)**, Xu Li et.al., [2404.01780v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01780v1)

 Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for investigating dark matter and dark energy properties. With the advent of large-scale sky surveys, we can discover strong lensing systems on an unprecedented scale, which requires efficient tools to extract them from billions of astronomical objects. The existing mainstream lens-finding tools are based on machine learning algorithms and applied to cut-out-centered galaxies. However, according to the design and survey strategy of optical surveys by CSST, preparing cutouts with multiple bands requires considerable efforts. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a framework based on a hierarchical visual Transformer with a sliding window technique to search for strong lensing systems within entire images. Moreover, given that multi-color images of strong lensing systems can provide insights into their physical characteristics, our framework is specifically crafted to identify strong lensing systems in images with any number of channels. As evaluated using CSST mock data based on an Semi-Analytic Model named CosmoDC2, our framework achieves precision and recall rates of 0.98 and 0.90, respectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method in real observations, we have applied it to a subset of images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and media images from Euclid Early Release Observations. 61 new strong lensing system candidates are discovered by our method. However, we also identified false positives arising primarily from the simplified galaxy morphology assumptions within the simulation. This underscores the practical limitations of our approach while simultaneously highlighting potential avenues for future improvements.

2024-04-02, **Brightest Cluster Galaxies and the Intracluster Light**, Emanuele Contini et.al., [2404.01560v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01560v1)

 In this chapter, we delve into the formation and primary characteristics of two significant components within galaxy clusters: the brightest cluster galaxies and the intracluster light. Drawing upon recent and pertinent studies in the field, we explore the mechanisms driving their growth from high redshift to the present day. We also examine how these formation mechanisms are intertwined with the dynamical state of their host clusters, suggesting their potential utility as luminous tracers of dark matter.

2024-04-01, **Upcoming searches for decaying dark matter with ULTRASAT ultraviolet maps**, Sarah Libanore et.al., [2404.01500v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01500v1)

 Decaying dark matter (DDM) can be tested via different astrophysical and cosmological probes. In particular, particles in the $\sim$ 9.5 - 30 eV mass range that decay into monochromatic photons, would contribute to the extragalactic background light (EBL) in the ultraviolet (UV) bandwidth. In this work, we show that an intriguing improvement to the constraints on such DDM models can come from broadband UV surveys, such as GALEX or the upcoming ULTRASAT satellite. These provide diffuse light maps of the UV EBL, integrated over a wide redshift range. The cross correlation between intensity fluctuations in these maps with a reference spectroscopic galaxy survey, can be used to reconstruct the redshift evolution of the EBL intensity; in this way, it is also possible to detect signatures of contributions from DDM. We forecast the constraining power of (GALEX+ULTRASAT)$\times$DESI, and we show they will be able to detect DDM with decay rate up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-26}\,{\rm s})$. In the context of axion-like particles (ALP), our forecasts can be converted to constraints on the ALP-photon coupling; our results show this technique will test ALP with coupling $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-12}\,{\rm GeV^{-1}})$, more than an order of magnitude better than current bounds in this mass range.

2024-04-01, **Probing Stochastic Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational-Wave Interferometers**, Yue-Hui Yao et.al., [2404.01494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01494v1)

 Ultralight particles are theoretically well-motivated dark matter candidates. In the vicinity of the solar system, these ultralight particles are described as a superposition of plane waves, resulting in a stochastic field with amplitude fluctuations on scales determined by the velocity dispersion of dark matter. In this work, we systematically investigate the sensitivity of space-based gravitational-wave interferometers to the stochastic ultralight dark matter field within the frequentist framework. We derive the projected sensitivity of a single detector using the time-delay interferometry and find that the stochastic effect will only diminish the performance of the detector marginally, unlike searches in other contexts where significant reductions are found. Furthermore, we explore the sensitivity of detector network in two typical configurations. We find that the well-separated configuration, where the distance between two detectors exceeds the coherence length of dark matter, is the optimal choice for ultralight dark matter detection due to a less chance of missing signal. This contrasts with the detection of stochastic gravitational-wave background, where the co-located and co-aligned configuration is preferred. Our results may provide useful insights for potential joint observations involving gravitational-wave detectors like LISA, Taiji and TianQin.

2024-04-01, **Stellar Variability and Distance Indicators in the Near-infrared in Nearby Galaxies. I. RR Lyrae and Anomalous Cepheids in Draco dwarf spheroidal**, Anupam Bhardwaj et.al., [2404.01394v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01394v1)

 Draco dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is one of the nearest and the most dark matter dominated satellites of the Milky Way. We obtained multi-epoch near-infrared (NIR, $JHK\_s$) observations of the central region of Draco dSph covering a sky area of $\sim 21'\times21'$ using the WIRCam instrument at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Homogeneous $JHK\_s$ time-series photometry for 212 RR Lyrae (173 fundamental-mode, 24 first-overtone, and 15 mixed-mode variables) and 5 Anomalous Cepheids in Draco dSph is presented and used to derive their period-luminosity relations at NIR wavelengths for the first-time. The small scatter of $\sim 0.05$~mag in these empirical relations for RR Lyrae stars is consistent with those in globular clusters and suggests a very small metallicity spread, up to $\sim0.2$~dex, among these centrally located variables. Based on empirically calibrated NIR period-luminosity-metallicity relations for RR Lyrae in globular clusters, we determined a distance modulus to Draco dSph of $\mu\_\textrm{RRL} = 19.557 \pm 0.026$ mag. The calibrated $K\_s$-band period-luminosity relations for Anomalous Cepheids in the Draco dSph and the Large Magellanic Cloud exhibit statistically consistent slopes but systematically different zero-points, hinting at possible metallicity dependence of $\sim-0.3$ mag~dex$^{-1}$. Finally, the apparent magnitudes of the tip of the red giant branch in $I$ and $J$ bands also agree well with their absolute calibrations with the adopted RR Lyrae distance to Draco. Our recommended $\sim1.5\%$ precise RR Lyrae distance, $D\_\textrm{Draco} = 81.55 \pm 0.98 \textrm{(statistical)} \pm 1.17 \textrm{(systematic)}$~kpc, is the most accurate and precise distance to Draco dSph galaxy.

2024-04-01, **Dianoga SIDM: galaxy cluster self-interacting dark matter simulations**, Antonio Ragagnin et.al., [2404.01383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01383v1)

 This work aims at assessing the impact of DM self-interactions on the properties of galaxy clusters. In particular, the goal is to study the angular dependence of the cross section by testing rare (large angle scattering) and frequent (small angle scattering) SIDM models with velocity-dependent cross sections. We re-simulate six galaxy cluster zoom-in initial conditions with a dark matter only run and with a full-physics setup simulations that includes a self-consistent treatment of baryon physics. We test the dark matter only setup and the full physics setup with either collisionless cold dark matter, rare self-interacting dark matter, and frequent self-interacting dark matter models. We then study their matter density profiles as well as their subhalo population. Our dark matter only SIDM simlations agree with theoretical models, and when baryons are included in simulations, our SIDM models substantially increase the central density of galaxy cluster cores compared to full-physics simulations using collisionless dark matter. SIDM subhalo suppression in full-physics simulations is milder compared to the one found in dark matter only simulations, because of the cuspier baryionic potential that prevent subhalo disruption. Moreover SIDM with small-angle scattering significantly suppress a larger number of subhaloes compared to large angle scattering SIDM models. Additionally, SIDM models generate a broader range of subhalo concentration values, including a tail of more diffuse subhaloes in the outskirts of galaxy clusters and a population of more compact subhaloes in the cluster cores.

2024-04-01, **Constraints on Dark Matter from Dynamical Heating of Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarfs. Part 2: Substructure and the Primordial Power Spectrum**, Peter W. Graham et.al., [2404.01378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01378v1)

 There is a large and growing interest in observations of small-scale structure in dark matter. We propose a new way to probe dark matter structures in the $\sim 10 - 10^8 \, M\_\odot$ range. This allows us to constrain the primordial power spectrum over shorter distances scales than possible with direct observations from the CMB. For $k$ in the range $\sim 10 - 1000 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ our constraints on the power spectrum are orders of magnitude stronger than previous bounds.   We also set some of the strongest constraints on dark matter isocurvature perturbations. Our method relies on the heating effect such dark matter substructures would have on the distribution of stars in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. Many models of inflation produce enhanced power at these short distance scales and can thus be constrained by our observation. Further, many dark matter models such as axion dark matter, self-interacting dark matter and dissipative dark matter, produce dense structures which could be constrained this way.

2024-04-01, **Galaxy shapes in Magneticum. I. Connecting stellar and dark matter shapes to dynamical and morphological galaxy properties and the large-scale structure**, Lucas M. Valenzuela et.al., [2404.01368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01368v1)

 Despite being a fundamental property of galaxies that dictates the form of the potential, the 3D shape is intrinsically difficult to determine from observations. The improving quality of triaxial modeling methods in recent years has made it possible to measure these shapes more accurately. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the stellar and dark matter (DM) shapes of galaxies and the connections between them as well as with other galaxy properties. Using the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Magneticum Box4, we computed the stellar and DM shapes of galaxies at different radii. We determined their morphologies, their projected morphological and kinematic parameters, and their fractions of in-situ formed stars. The DM follows the stellar component in shape and orientation at $3R\_{1/2}$, indicating that DM is heavily influenced by the baryonic potential in the inner parts of the halo. The outer DM halo is independent of the inner properties such as morphology, however, and is more closely related to the large-scale anisotropy of the gas inflow. The stellar shapes of galaxies are correlated with morphology: ellipticals feature more spherical and prolate shapes than disk galaxies. Galaxies with more rotational support are flatter, and the stellar shapes are connected to the mass distribution. In particular, more extended elliptical galaxies have larger triaxialities. Finally, the shapes can be used to constrain the in-situ fraction of stars when combined with the stellar mass. The found relations show that shapes depend on the details of the accretion history. The similarities between the inner DM and stellar shapes signal the importance of baryonic matter for DM in galaxies and will help improve dynamical models in the future. At large radii the DM shape is completely decoupled from the central galaxy and is coupled more to the large-scale inflow.

2024-04-01, **Constraining Dark Matter Annihilation with Fermi-LAT Observations of Ultra-Faint Compact Stellar Systems**, A. Circiello et.al., [2404.01181v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01181v1)

 Recent results from numerical simulations and models of galaxy formation suggest that recently discovered ultra-faint compact stellar systems (UFCSs) in the halo of the Milky Way (MW) may be some of the smallest and faintest galaxies.   If this is the case, these systems would be attractive targets for indirect searches of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) annihilation due to their relative proximity and high expected DM content.   In this study, we analyze 14.3 years of gamma-ray data collected by the Fermi-LAT coincident with 26 UFCSs.   No significant excess gamma-ray emission is detected, and we present gamma-ray flux upper limits for these systems.   Assuming that the UFCSs are dark-matter-dominated galaxies consistent with being among the faintest and least massive MW dwarf spheroidal (dSphs) satellite galaxies, we derive the projected sensitivity for a dark matter annihilation signal.   We find that observations of UFCSs have the potential to yield some of the most powerful constraints on DM annihilation, with sensitivity comparable to observations of known dSphs and the Galactic center.   This result emphasizes the importance of precise kinematic studies of UFCSs to empirically determine their DM content.

2024-04-01, **Cosmic Web Classification through Stochastic Topological Ranking**, Alejandro Palomino et.al., [2404.01124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01124v1)

 This paper introduces ASTRA (Algorithm for Stochastic Topological RAnking), a novel method designed for the classification of galaxies into principal cosmic web structures -- voids, sheets, filaments, and knots -- especially tailored for large spectroscopic surveys. ASTRA utilizes observed data and a corresponding random catalog, generating probabilities for data and random points to belong to each cosmic web type. Extensive evaluation includes testing on datasets from N-body simulations (dark matter only and hydrodynamical) and observations, incorporating visual inspections and quantitative analyses of mass and volume filling fractions. ASTRA demonstrates proficiency in constructing void size function catalogs and is benchmarked against established cosmic web classification methods. Spatial correlations among cosmic web types are explored using 2-point correlation functions. ASTRA's approach to the cosmic web holds promise for enhancing the retrieval of non-standard clustering statistics, thereby advancing the estimation of cosmological parameters. With simplicity, speed, and applicability across various datasets, ASTRA is a valuable tool in the quantitative study of the large-scale structure of the Universe.

2024-04-01, **Magnetic axion vortex and very light QCD axions**, Deog Ki Hong et.al., [2404.00997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00997v1)

 We show that a stable vortex soliton, carrying a constant magnetic flux, exists in the homogeneous medium of axions with a constant time-derivative. Axions can be bound in the vortex, having energy less than the axion mass. If the observed magnetic fields in galaxies are those of the vortex, the axion-photon coupling has to be smaller than $10^{-17}\,{\rm GeV^{-1}}$. Otherwise, axions decay too quickly to constitute dark matter in galaxies.

2024-04-01, **Spiral Galaxies' Disk Dominance and Testing MOND**, Gene Byrd et.al., [2404.00944v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00944v1)

 Many Hubble type S galaxies have a flat rotation curve, V extending into the outer disk. The surface brightness there is too low to create V from stars of a reasonable mass-to-light ratio. To maintain a stable disk, a massive dark matter halo is usually assumed to dominate in creating V. Gravitational arm amplification is used here to estimate whether V is created by a disk mixture, or by a 100 percent halo. The disk surface density is not estimated from the disk surface brightness and an assumed mass to light ratio. The observed arm pitch angle is presumed to be long term maximally amplified. This permits calculation of the disk surface mass density with radius relative to a 100 percent disk which would fully create V. NGC 7217's tightly wound 4.8 degree arm pitch angle indicates a disk component contributing 43 percent of the observed V for the range over the spiral arms (important but not dominant). It has too low a disk density to create V with the rest presumably arising from a halo. V is proportional to the square root of surface density. By contrast a loose arm galaxy disk can dominate in creating V. For example NGC 3198's arm pitch angle of 30 degrees implies a disk surface density sufficient to account for 88 percent of V which is a dominant fraction. Little dark matter halo is needed for galaxies like this. Observationally, the dark outer disk may be molecular hydrogen. NGC 3198's dominant disk also provides a counter example to the need for any universal (MOND) force law modification over the outer disk spiral arms.

 The dark photon is a promising candidate for the dark matter which comprises most of the matter in our visible Universe. Via kinetic mixing with the Standard Model it can also be resonantly converted to photons in an electromagnetic cavity, offering novel experimental possibilities for the discovery and study of dark matter. We report the results of a pathfinder dark photon dark matter cavity search experiment performed at Hunan Normal University and the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, representing the first stage of the APEX (Axion and dark Photon EXperiment) program. Finding no statistically significant excess, we place an upper limit on the kinetic mixing parameter $\|\chi\|<3.7\times 10^{-13}$ around $m\_A\simeq 29.5$ $\mu$eV at 90% confidence level. This result exceeds other constraints on dark photon dark matter in this frequency range by roughly an order of magnitude.

 A bright ($m\_{\rm F150W,AB}$=24 mag), $z=1.95$ supernova (SN) candidate was discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging acquired on 2023 November 17. The SN is quintuply-imaged as a result of strong gravitational lensing by a foreground galaxy cluster, detected in three locations, and remarkably is the second lensed SN found in the same host galaxy. The previous lensed SN was called "Requiem", and therefore the new SN is named "Encore". This makes the MACS J0138.0$-$2155 cluster the first known system to produce more than one multiply-imaged SN. Moreover, both SN Requiem and SN Encore are Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia), making this the most distant case of a galaxy hosting two SNe Ia. Using parametric host fitting, we determine the probability of detecting two SNe Ia in this host galaxy over a $\sim10$ year window to be $\approx3\%$. These observations have the potential to yield a Hubble Constant ($H\_0$) measurement with $\sim10\%$ precision, only the third lensed SN capable of such a result, using the three visible images of the SN. Both SN Requiem and SN Encore have a fourth image that is expected to appear within a few years of $\sim2030$, providing unprecedented baseline for time-delay cosmography.

 We present a comprehensive reassessment of the state of Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) cosmology, namely models featuring a non-gravitational interaction between Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). To achieve high generality, we extend the dark sector physics by considering two different scenarios: a non-dynamical DE equation of state $w\_0\neq-1$, and a dynamical $w(a)=w\_0+w\_a(1-a)$. In both cases, we distinguish two different physical regimes resulting from a phantom or quintessence equation of state. To circumvent early-time superhorizon instabilities, the energy-momentum transfer should occur in opposing directions within the two regimes, resulting in distinct phenomenological outcomes. We study quintessence and phantom non-dynamical and dynamical models in light of two independent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments - the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We analyze CMB data both independently and in combination with Supernovae (SN) distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon-Plus catalog and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Our results update and extend the state-of-the-art analyses, significantly narrowing the parameter space allowed for these models and limiting their overall ability to reconcile cosmological tensions. Although considering different combinations of data leaves some freedom to increase $H\_0$ towards the value measured by the SH0ES collaboration, our most constraining dataset (CMB+BAO+SN) indicates that fully reconciling the tension solely within the framework of IDE remains challenging.

2024-04-02, **On the surface helium abundance of B-type hot subdwarf stars from the WD+MS channel of Type Ia supernovae**, Rui-Jie Ji et.al., [2404.01905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01905v1)

 The origin of intermediate helium (He)-rich hot subdwarfs are still unclear. Previous studies have suggested that some surviving Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) companions from the white dwarf~+~main-sequence (WD+MS) channel may contribute to the intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. However, previous studies ignored the impact of atomic diffusion on the post-explosion evolution of surviving companion stars of SNe Ia, leading to that they could not explain the observed surface He abundance of intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. In this work, by taking the atomic diffusion and stellar wind into account, we trace the surviving companions of SNe Ia from the WD+MS channel using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code \textsc{MESA} until they evolve into hot subdwarfs. We find that the surface He-abundances of our surviving companion models during their core He-burning phases are in a range of $-1 \lesssim {\rm log}(N\_{\rm He}/N\_{\rm H}) \lesssim 0$, which are consistent with those observed in intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. This seems to further support that surviving companions of SNe Ia in the WD+MS channel are possible to form some intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs.

2024-04-02, **Diversity in hydrogen-rich envelope mass of type II supernovae (I): V -band light curve modeling**, Qiliang Fang et.al., [2404.01776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01776v1)

 We conduct a systematic study on the light curves of type II supernovae (SNe II) to investigate how they are affected by the physical properties of the progenitor and the nature of the explosion. The calculations of pre-supernova evolution, the launch of the explosion, and the light curve are carried out by \texttt{MESA} and \texttt{STELLA}. Our study encompasses a wide range of zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) masses (10 - 20 $M\_{\rm \odot}$), wind mass-loss rates (which control the range of hydrogen-rich envelope mass to be 3 - 12 $M\_{\rm \odot}$), explosion energies (0.1 - 2.5 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg), and $^{56}$Ni masses (0 - 0.15 $M\_{\rm \odot}$). Our analyses reveal that when the explosion energy is fixed, the light curve is primarily determined by the properties of the hydrogen-rich envelope, despite the large variation in the ZAMS masses. The dependencies of the light-curve characteristics on the envelope mass, radius, and explosion energy are investigated, and we establish the scaling relations connecting these quantities. We further derive a formula that corrects for effects of the $^{56}$Ni heating based on observables. Using the derived equations, we develop a method that can constrain the envelope mass with uncertainty within 1 $M\_{\rm \odot}$ based on photometry. This method is applied to a large sample of $\sim$ 100 SNe II, which reveals a considerably broader range of the envelope masses estimated from observables as compared to those predicted by single star models evolving with standard stellar wind; this finding indicates that a large fraction of SNe II experience substantial mass-loss beyond the standard mass-loss prescription prior to their explosions, highlighting the uncertainties involved in the massive star evolution and pre-SN mass-loss mechanism.

2024-04-02, **Finite-temperature expansion of the dense-matter equation of state**, Debora Mroczek et.al., [2404.01658v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01658v1)

 In this work we provide a new, well-controlled expansion of the equation of state of dense matter from zero to finite temperatures ($T$), while covering a wide range of charge fractions ($Y\_Q$), from pure neutron to isospin symmetric nuclear matter. Our expansion can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point neutron star observations, while maintaining agreement with laboratory data, in a model independent way. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data that can help constrain the finite $T$ equation of state. With our new method, we can quantify the uncertainty in our finite $T$ and $Y\_Q$ expansions in a well-controlled manner without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We can reproduce results from a microscopic equation of state up to $T=100$ MeV for baryon chemical potential $\mu\_B\gtrsim 1100$ MeV ($\sim1-2 \ n\_{\rm sat}$) within $5\%$ error, with even better results for larger $\mu\_B$ and/or lower $T$. We investigate the sources of numerical and theoretical uncertainty and discuss future directions of study.

2024-04-01, **Non-radial oscillations in newly born compact star considering effects of phase transition**, Anil Kumar et.al., [2404.01252v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01252v1)

 The massive stars end their lives by supernova explosions leaving central compact objects that may evolve into neutron stars. Initially, after birth, the star remains hot and gradually cools down. We explore the matter and star properties during this initial stage of the compact stars considering the possibility of the appearance of deconfined quark matter in the core of the star. At the initial stage after the supernova explosion, the occurrence of non-radial oscillation in the newly born compact object is highly possible. Non-radial oscillations are an important source of GWs. There is a high chance for GWs from these oscillations, especially the nodeless fundamental (f-) mode to be detected by next-generation GW detectors. We study the evolution in frequencies of non-radial oscillation after birth considering phase transition and predicting the possible signature for different possibilities of theoretical compact star models.
