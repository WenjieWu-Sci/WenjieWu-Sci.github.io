2025-08-04, **Lepton parity dark matter and naturally unstable domain walls**, Ernest Ma et.al., [2508.02642v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02642v1)

 We propose a simple and predictive setup that connects neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and gravitational waves. A minimal lepton parity DM scenario is considered where the residual symmetry $(-1)^L$ from the type I seesaw acts as the dark parity $D=(-1)^{L+2j}$, ensuring DM stability without imposing any new symmetry. A singlet Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity serves as the DM candidate, interacting via a real scalar $\sigma$ which is also even lepton parity. The scalar potential possesses an accidental $\mathcal{Z}\_2$ symmetry, whose spontaneous breaking gives rise to unstable domain walls (DW) in the presence of explicit $\mathcal{Z}\_2$ breaking terms allowed by the lepton parity. The subsequent DW annihilation generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background potentially observable at different GW experiments.

2025-08-04, **Impact of Non-Thermal Leptogenesis from Early Matter Domination on Gravitational Wave from FOPT**, Dilip Kumar Ghosh et.al., [2508.02619v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02619v1)

 We study the impact of non-thermal leptogenesis on the spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by a strong first-order phase transition in the early Universe. We consider a scenario in which a heavy scalar field, $\phi$, dominates the energy density of the early Universe and decays into heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of RHNs generates a lepton asymmetry, which is partially converted into the observed baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron process. The $\phi$-dominated era and the entropy injection from the decays of $\phi$ and RHNs leave characteristic imprints on the GW spectrum, such as damping and modified frequency dependence, that distinguish it from the standard cosmological evolution. We identify the parameter space in which non-thermal leptogenesis is successful, leading to distinctive GW spectral features. We show that these GW signals can fall within the sensitivity ranges of future detectors such as ET, DECIGO and BBO. If observed, they would provide valuable insights into the thermal history and dynamics of the early Universe.

2025-08-04, **Commissioning of the NUCLEUS Experiment at the Technical University of Munich**, H. Abele et.al., [2508.02488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02488v1)

 The NUCLEUS experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering of reactor antineutrinos on CaWO$\_4$ targets in the fully coherent regime, using gram-scale cryogenic calorimeters. The experimental apparatus will be installed at the Chooz nuclear power plant in France, in the vicinity of two 4.25 GW$\_{\text{th}}$ reactor cores. This work presents results from the commissioning of an essential version of the experiment at the shallow Underground Laboratory of the Technical University of Munich. For the first time, two cryogenic target detectors were tested alongside active and passive shielding systems. Over a period of two months all detector subsystems were operated with stable performance. Background measurements were conducted, providing important benchmarks for the modeling of background sources at the reactor site. Finally, we present ongoing efforts to upgrade the detector systems in preparation for a technical run at Chooz in 2026, and highlight the remaining challenges to achieving neutrino detection.

2025-08-04, **$νp$-process in Core-Collapse Supernovae: Imprints of General Relativistic Effects**, Alexander Friedland et.al., [2508.02055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02055v1)

 The origin of certain proton-rich isotopes in the solar system, particularly $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$, has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity (GR) on the $\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$ nuclei up to $A \lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the $\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M\_\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our 12.75 $M\_\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects play in the $\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.

2025-08-04, **Searches for new light particles at the Troitsk Meson Factory (TiMoFey)**, Sergey Demidov et.al., [2508.01968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01968v1)

 The project of a new accelerator complex at the Institute for Nuclear Research of RAS in Troitsk has recently been included in the Russian National Program ``Fundamental Properties of Matter". It will sustain a proton beam with a current of 300 (100) $\mu$A and a proton kinetic energy of $T\_p=423\,(1300)$ MeV at the first (second) stage of operation. The complex is multidisciplinary, and here we investigate its prospects in exploring new physics with light, feebly interacting particles. We find that TiMoFey can access new regions of parameter space of models with light axion-like particles and models with hidden photons, provided by a generic multipurpose detector installed downstream the proton beam dump. The signature to be exploited is the decay of a new particle into a pair of known particles inside the detector. Likewise, TiMoFey can probe previously unreachable ranges of parameters of models with millicharged particles obtained in measurements with detectors recognizing energy deposits associated with elastic scattering of new particles, passing through the detector volume. The latter detector may be useful for dark matter searches, as well as for studies of neutrino physics suggested at the facility in the Program framework.

2025-08-03, **Proton Transparency and Neutrino Physics: New Methods and Modeling**, S. Dytman et.al., [2508.01905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01905v1)

 Extracting accurate results from neutrino oscillation and cross section experiments requires accurate simulation of the neutrino-nucleus interaction. The rescattering of outgoing hadrons (final state interactions) by the rest of the nucleus is an important component of these interactions. We present a new measurement of proton transparency (defined as the fraction of outgoing protons that emerge without significant rescattering) using electron-nucleus scattering data recorded by the CLAS detector at Jefferson Laboratory on helium, carbon, and iron targets. This analysis by the Electrons for Neutrinos ($e4\nu$) collaboration uses a new data-driven method to extract the transparency. It defines transparency as the ratio of electron-scattering events with a detected proton to quasi-elastic electron-scattering events where a proton should have been knocked out. Our results are consistent with previous measurements that determined the transparency from the ratio of measured events to theoretically predicted events. We find that the GENIE event generator, which is widely used by oscillation experiments to simulate neutrino-nucleus interactions, needs to better describe both the nuclear ground state and proton rescattering in order to reproduce our measured transparency ratios, especially at lower proton momenta.

2025-08-03, **Lattice Calculation of Short-Range Contributions to Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay $π^-\toπ^+ ee$ at Physical Pion Mass**, Peter Boyle et.al., [2508.01900v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01900v1)

 Neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decays provide an excellent probe for determining whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana fermions. The short-range matrix elements associated with the $\pi^- \to \pi^+ ee$ process contribute at leading order in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay channel $nn \to ppee$ through pion exchange between nucleons. However, current lattice calculations show notable discrepancies in predicting these short-range contributions. To address this issue, we perform a lattice QCD calculation of the $\pi^- \to \pi^+ ee$ matrix elements using domain wall fermion ensembles at the physical pion mass generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations. To mitigate contamination from around-the-world effects, we develop a new method to reconstruct and subtract them directly from lattice data. We then perform a nonperturbative renormalization using the RI/SMOM scheme. Compared with previous studies, this work reduces the uncertainties in the matrix elements and provides an independent cross-check that helps to reconcile the discrepancies among previous lattice calculations.

2025-08-03, **Efficient optimization of expensive black-box simulators via marginal means, with application to neutrino detector design**, Hwanwoo Kim et.al., [2508.01834v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01834v1)

 With advances in scientific computing, computer experiments are increasingly used for optimizing complex systems. However, for modern applications, e.g., the optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require hundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over a high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs $\mathbf{x}\_1, \cdots, \mathbf{x}\_n$, the best solution from these evaluated inputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases. Existing black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner'' (PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address this, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM) approach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\mathbf{x}^*$ that leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently inferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can select solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance. Assuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with unknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM estimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization rate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods, thus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a practical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive Gaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of BOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector optimization in nuclear physics.

2025-08-04, **Testing Dark Matter with Generative Models for Extragalactic Stellar Streams**, Jacob Nibauer et.al., [2508.02666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02666v1)

 Upcoming ground and space-based surveys are poised to illuminate low surface brightness tidal features, providing a new observable connection to dark matter physics. From imaging of tidal debris, the morphology of stellar streams can be used to infer the geometry of dark matter halos. In this paper, we develop a generative approach, X-Stream, which translates stream imaging into constraints on the radial density profile of dark matter halos--from the inner region out to the virial radius. Using the GPU-accelerated code streamsculptor, we generate thousands of stream realizations in trial gravitational potentials and apply nested sampling with a custom objective function to explore viable regions of parameter space. We find that multiple stellar streams can be used to constrain the entire radial density profile of a halo, including both its inner and outer density slopes. These constraints provide a test for alternatives to cold dark matter, such as self-interacting dark matter, which predicts cored density profiles. From cosmological simulations, the outer density slope is expected to correlate with merger histories though remains underexplored observationally. With ongoing and upcoming missions such as Euclid, the Rubin Observatory, ARRAKIHS, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, X-Stream will enable detailed mapping of dark matter for thousands of galaxies across a wide range of redshifts and halo masses.

2025-08-04, **Particle Detection Using Magnetic Avalanches in Single-Molecule Magnet Crystals**, Bailey Kohn et.al., [2508.02467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02467v1)

 The detection of a single quantum of energy with high efficiency and a low false positive rate is of considerable scientific interest, from serving as single quantum sensors of optical and infra-red photons to enabling the direct detection of low-mass dark matter. We confirm our initial experimental demonstration of magnetic avalanches induced by scattering of quanta in single-molecule magnet (SMM) crystals made of Mn$\_{12}$-acetate, establishing the use of SMMs as particle detectors for the first time. Although the current setup has an energy threshold in the MeV regime, our results motivate the exploration of a wide variety of SMMs whose properties could allow for detection of sub-eV energy depositions.

2025-08-04, **Low-Energy Calibration of SuperCDMS HVeV Cryogenic Silicon Calorimeters Using Compton Steps**, SuperCDMS Collaboration et.al., [2508.02402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02402v1)

 Cryogenic calorimeters for low-mass dark matter searches have achieved sub-eV energy resolutions, driving advances in both low-energy calibration techniques and our understanding of detector physics. The energy deposition spectrum of gamma rays scattering off target materials exhibits step-like features, known as Compton steps, near the binding energies of atomic electrons. We demonstrate a successful use of Compton steps for sub-keV calibration of cryogenic silicon calorimeters, utilizing four SuperCDMS High-Voltage eV-resolution (HVeV) detectors operated with 0 V bias across the crystal. This new calibration at 0 V is compared with the established high-voltage calibration using optical photons. The comparison indicates that the detector response at 0 V is about 30% weaker than expected, highlighting challenges in detector response modeling for low-mass dark matter searches.

2025-08-04, **Dynamical analysis of cosmological models in non-minimal scalar non-metricity gravity**, Bikash Chandra Roy et.al., [2508.02396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02396v1)

 We investigate the evolution of a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe in the framework of scalar non-metricity theory of gravity. In the model, we consider dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) described by the scalar field. In the paper, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the evolution of the observed universe. We probe the universe with and without an interaction between DM and the effective energy density including scalar field in the non-metricity theory that describes the DE. The critical points of the autonomous system and their stability are determined to understand the behaviour of the universe. The cosmological models accommodate the late accelerating phase of the universe for a given set of parameters, a matter-dominated saddle point is also found to exist which is flowed by a decelerating phase dominated by stiff fluid like DE. We obtain a new class of cosmological model accommodating early inflation, matter-dominated era, and a future decelerating phase followed by late acceleration of the universe.

2025-08-04, **Tribute to Toshimitsu Yamazaki (1934-2025): Quest for Exotic Hadronic Matter**, Avraham Gal et.al., [2508.02267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02267v1)

 In this talk I pay tribute to Toshimitsu Yamazaki who died earlier this year. Yamazaki's leading contributions to Hadronic Physics, in particular to Strangeness Nuclear Physics in Japan and elsewhere, are well known. Two of the five Recurring Themes of his research, as listed in the Japan Academy site, are highlighted here: (i) Discovery of deeply bound pionic-atom states, and (ii) Search for kaonic nuclei -- Kaonic Proton Matter (KPM). I conclude by reviewing briefly my own recent work, confirming Farrar's conjecture that a deeply bound $H$ dibaryon is not ruled out by the weak-decay observation of $\Lambda\Lambda$ hypernuclei. However, the relatively long lifetime of such a deeply bound $H$ is much too short to qualify it for a Dark-Matter candidate.

2025-08-04, **Wiener filtering and multi-tracer techniques for dark matter cross-correlations between gamma-ray emission and galaxy catalogs**, Andrea Rubiola et.al., [2508.02160v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02160v1)

 Cross-correlations between a gravitational tracer of dark matter and the contribution to the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) from the radiation produced by the annihilation of the particles responsible for the dark matter, have been established as a powerful tool to investigate the particle physics nature of dark matter. Cross-correlations of the UGRB with galaxy catalogs, cluster catalogs and weak lensing have indeed been measured. In this paper we study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied. The inclusion of the full multi-tracer information can improve the sensitivity up to a factor of 5 for dark matter masses below about 50 GeV, the Wiener filter remaining the best option for heavier dark matter.

2025-08-04, **STRRINGS: STReams in Residual Images of Nearby GalaxieS**, E. Sola et.al., [2508.02154v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02154v1)

 Tidal features from galaxy mergers, particularly stellar streams, offer valuable insights into galaxy assembly and dark matter halo properties. This paper aims to identify a large sample of nearby stellar streams suitable for detailed modelling and comparison with simulations to enable population-level constraints on halo properties. We visually inspect and compile a tidal feature catalogue for $19,387$ galaxies with redshift $z \leq 0.02$ from the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 using original, model, and residual images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Residual images, produced by subtracting models of all sources, enhance the detectability of faint asymmetries such as tidal features. We find that $11.9 \pm 0.2\%$ of galaxies host tidal features, more frequently around early-type than late-type galaxies. The tidal feature fraction increases with stellar mass, from $2.4 \pm 0.4\%$ at $\sim10^8$M$\_\odot$ to $36.5 \pm 1.2\%$ at $\sim 5\times10^{11}$M$\_\odot$. From this, we present the first release of STRRINGS: STReams in Residual Images of Nearby GalaxieS, a subsample of 35 galaxies with long, narrow streams suitable for modelling. We segment these streams and derive their geometry, surface brightness, colours, and stellar masses. The median $g$-band surface brightness is 26.8 mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$, reaching 27.5 mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$ for the faintest stream. Mass ratios are consistent with minor mergers, and we identify five potential dwarf galaxy progenitors. Our streams are typically longer (median 124 kpc) than the literature, with comparable widths. Stream mass correlates with length and colour, and wider streams lie at larger galactocentric radii. STRRINGS will be expanded and used to constrain halo properties in future work.

2025-08-03, **Averaging Dynamics of Scalar Field-Matter Interacting Models in Anisotropic Universes: The Locally Rotationally Symmetric Bianchi I Spacetime**, Alfredo D. Millano et.al., [2508.01876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01876v1)

 We consider an anisotropic cosmological model based on the locally rotational Bianchi I spacetime, incorporating a scalar field and a non-zero cosmological interaction term. The framework of averaging theory is employed to study the associated non-linear differential equations. Through a qualitative analysis of the gravitational field equations, we obtain valuable insights into the structure of the solution space for the anisotropic scalar field model with a generalized harmonic potential. The interaction between the scalar field and matter is described by a general expression that depends on the Hubble parameter, the time derivative of the scalar field, and the energy densities of cold dark matter and dark energy. This formulation involves real parameters that modulate the interaction, as well as a coupling constant with the dimensions of the Hubble parameter. We show that the Hubble parameter serves as a time-dependent perturbation parameter, controlling the discrepancy between the full system and its time-averaged counterpart. As this parameter decreases, both systems converge to the same asymptotic behaviour. This enables the suppression of oscillatory effects, significantly simplifying the dynamical analysis. Finally, we identify conditions on the interaction parameters that ensure the regularity of the system's evolution by preventing the emergence of singularities.

2025-08-03, **Resolving the Planck-DESI tension by non-minimally coupled quintessence**, Jia-Qi Wang et.al., [2508.01759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01759v1)

 The Planck measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed the matter fraction $\Omega\_\mathrm{m}$ tension between DESI-$\Lambda$CDM and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of the equation-of-state through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we will illustrate with a string-theory-motivated model that, when the DM non-minimally couples to gravity via a quintessence field, a misidentification with the $w\_0w\_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, while the coupled quintessence never crosses $w=-1$ but behaves as a standard CDM in the early Universe and approaches a cosmological constant in the late Universe. Such a non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. The worsened $\Omega\_\mathrm{m}$ tension and $S\_8$ tension in the $w\_0w\_a$CDM model are also resolved in our model.

2025-08-04, **Optical and near-infrared nebular-phase spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi: constraints on the structure of the inner ejecta, progenitor mass, and dust**, Emilio Hueichapán et.al., [2508.02656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02656v1)

 We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN\,2024ggi from 250 and 420 days after the explosion. Comparing the evolution of the [\ion{O}{1}] at 6300, 6363 \text{\AA} doublet normalized to the continuum with spectral models from the literature, we estimate a progenitor star zero-age main-sequence mass ($M\_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$) of $\approx 14$ M$\_\odot$. This value is consistent with $M\_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$ reported in the literature from independent methodologies. The nebular spectra are used to study the structure of the inner ejecta. The broad H$\alpha$ line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\simeq 3900$ km s$^{-1}$, with small deviations from a symmetric Gaussian profile centred at zero velocity, and the [\ion{O}{1}] doublet is blue-shifted by $\approx -940$ km s$^{-1}$. In the NIR, the nebular spectra reveal double-peaked emission features of \ion{Mg}{1} and [\ion{Fe}{2}] lines, suggesting a bipolar distribution of intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the line-of-sight. Such a double-peaked feature in these NIR lines has not been previously reported. No corresponding asymmetries are observed in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that the asymmetry is mostly confined to intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the innermost core of the supernova ejecta. Additionally, we detect first-overtone carbon monoxide (CO) emission at $2.3$ $\mu$m from 250 to 319 days in the NIR.

2025-08-03, **Binary stellar evolution yields in galactic chemical evolution calculations**, Alex Kemp et.al., [2508.01717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01717v1)

 We present a framework for the computation of effective stellar yields that accounts for a mixed population of binary and single stars under an adjustable mix of binary evolution settings: the binary fraction, the accretion efficiencies of winds, Roche-lobe overflow, and supernovae. We emphasise the critical need for more complete yield coverage of the binary nucleosynthesis and evolution, without which the ability to make accurate predictions on the true role of binarity on GCE calculations is hamstrung. We also provide clear guidelines for future stellar modelling works to ensure their results are maximally useful to the wider community. We compute effective stellar yields using detailed binary stellar yields accounting for binary induced mass-loss from a solar-metallicity donor star. We study the effect of varying the binary mixture and accretion efficiencies, and consider a range of models for the treatment of accreted material on the secondary in detail. In the absence of detailed binary yields for the secondary, we put forth a model for the composition of accreted material that preserves the signature of the primary's nuclear processing within the post-mass-transfer secondary yields. Among the binary parameters, we find that the binary fraction, which determines the ratio of binary and single star systems, has the most significant effect on the effective stellar yields, with widespread impact across most isotopes. In contrast, varying the accretion efficiencies produces comparatively minor changes. We also find that the binary fraction has a significant influence on the logarithmic elemental abundance ratios relative to H present in the effective yield; this impact is largest for the lower-mass primaries.
