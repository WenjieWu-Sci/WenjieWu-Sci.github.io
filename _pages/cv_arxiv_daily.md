2023-11-16, **Physics Opportunities at a Beam Dump Facility at PIP-II at Fermilab and Beyond**, A. A. Aguilar-Arevalo et.al., [2311.09915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09915v1)

 The Fermilab Proton-Improvement-Plan-II (PIP-II) is being implemented in order to support the precision neutrino oscillation measurements at the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, the U.S. flagship neutrino experiment. The PIP-II LINAC is presently under construction and is expected to provide 800~MeV protons with 2~mA current. This white paper summarizes the outcome of the first workshop on May 10 through 13, 2023, to exploit this capability for new physics opportunities in the kinematic regime that are unavailable to other facilities, in particular a potential beam dump facility implemented at the end of the LINAC. Various new physics opportunities have been discussed in a wide range of kinematic regime, from eV scale to keV and MeV. We also emphasize that the timely establishment of the beam dump facility at Fermilab is essential to exploit these new physics opportunities.

2023-11-16, **Leptogenesis and dark matter in minimal inverse seesaw using $A_4$ modular symmetry**, Jotin Gogoi et.al., [2311.09883v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09883v1)

 In this paper we have studied neutrino masses and mixings by adding a scalar triplet $\eta$ to the particle content of minimal inverse seesaw. We have realised this extension of minimal inverse seesaw by implementing an isomorphic modular group $\Gamma(3)$ and a non-abelian discrete symmetry group $A\_4$. We have also used $Z\_3$ symmetry group to restrain certain interaction terms in the lagrangian of the model. We have studied baryon asymmetry of the universe, neutrinoless double-beta decay and dark matter in our work. In order to check the consistency of our model with various experimental constraints, we have therefore calculated effective mass, relic density and baryogenesis via leptogenesis. Interestingly, we have found our model quite compatible with the experimental bounds and is also successful in producing the neutrino masses and mixings in the 3$\sigma$ range.

2023-11-16, **Scotoseesaw model implied by dark right-handed neutrinos**, Phung Van Dong et.al., [2311.09795v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09795v1)

 We find a dark gauge symmetry $U(1)\_D$ that transforms nontrivially only for three right-handed neutrinos $\nu\_{1,2,3R}$. The anomaly cancellation demands that they have a dark charge $D=0,-1,+1$ assigned to $\nu\_{1,2,3R}$, respectively. The dark charge is broken by two units down to a dark parity, i.e. $U(1)\_D\to P\_D=(-1)^D$, which stabilizes a dark matter candidate. Interestingly, the model manifestly supplies neutrino masses via joint seesaw and scotogenic mechanisms, called scotoseesaw.

2023-11-16, **Neutrino nonradiative decay and the diffuse supernova neutrino background**, Pilar Iváñez-Ballesteros et.al., [2311.09725v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09725v1)

 The diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) is the constant flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos emitted by all past core collapses in the observable Universe. We study the potential to extract information on the neutrino lifetime from the upcoming observation of the DSNB flux. The DSNB flux has a unique sensitivity to neutrino nonradiative decay for $\tau / m \in \left[ 10^9, 10^{11}\right]$~s/eV. To this end, we integrate, for the first time, astrophysical uncertainties, the contribution from failed supernovae, and a three-neutrino description of neutrino nonradiative decay. We present our predictions for future detection at the running Super-Kamiokande + Gd and the upcoming Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, and DUNE experiments. Finally, our results show the importance of identifying the neutrino mass ordering to restrict the possible decay scenarios for the impact of nonradiative neutrino decay on the DSNB.

2023-11-16, **Cosmological constraints on neutrino masses in light of JWST red and massive candidate galaxies**, Jianqi Liu et.al., [2311.09703v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09703v1)

 The overabundance of the red and massive candidate galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) implies efficient structure formation or large star formation efficiency at high redshift $z\sim 10$. In the scenario of a low star formation efficiency, because massive neutrinos tend to suppress the growth of structure of the universe, the JWST observation tightens the upper bound of the neutrino masses. Assuming $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology and a star formation efficiency $\epsilon \lesssim 0.1$, we perform joint analyses of Planck+JWST and Planck+BAO+JWST, and obtain improved constraints $\sum m\_\nu<0.214\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $\sum m\_\nu < 0.114\,\mathrm{eV}$ at 95% confidence level, respectively. The inverted mass ordering, which implies $\sum m\_\nu\geq 0.1\mathrm{eV}$, is excluded by Planck+BAO+JWST at 92% confidence level.

2023-11-16, **Journey through Gauge Theories: From Foundations to New Frontiers**, Lisha et.al., [2311.09658v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09658v1)

 From the humble beginnings of particle physics to groundbreaking discoveries, the journey of particle physics has revolutionized our understanding of the universe. The progression of particle physics, begin from the discovery of new particles, to gauge symmetries and many successful theories in its journey which help in building up the model that explain the underlying makeup of matter, regulated by fundamental forces led to establishment of Standard Model(SM). The discovery of neutrino oscillations compelled scientists to explore theories that extend beyond the Standard Model, which opened up new frontiers in the field of particle physics. The theories have shifted its paradigm to a single comprehensive theory at the scale of 10^14 GeV. This article explains the journey of particle physics from the basic constituent to the theory of everything.

2023-11-16, **Demonstrating the Q-Pix front-end using discrete OpAmp and CMOS transistors**, Peng Miao et.al., [2311.09568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09568v1)

 Using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Operational Amplifiers (OpAmps) and Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, we present a demonstration of the Q-Pix front-end architecture, a novel readout solution for kiloton-scale Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detectors. The Q-Pix scheme employs a Charge-Integrate/Reset process based on the Least Action principle, enabling pixel-scale self-triggering charge collection and processing, minimizing energy consumption, and maximizing data compression. We examine the architecture's sensitivity, linearity, noise, and other features at the circuit board level and draw comparisons to SPICE simulations. Furthermore, we highlight the resemblance between the Q-Pix front-end and Sigma-Delta modulator, emphasizing that digital data processing techniques for Sigma-Delta can be directly applied to Q-Pix, resulting in enhanced signal-to-noise performance. These insights will inform the development of Q-Pix front-end designs in integrated circuits (IC) and guide data collection and processing for future large-scale LArTPC detectors in neutrino physics and other high-energy physics experiments.

2023-11-16, **Confronting electroweak MSSM through one-loop renormalized neutralino-Higgs interactions for dark matter direct detection and muon $(g-2)$**, Subhadip Bisal et.al., [2311.09938v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09938v1)

 We compute the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the vertices where a pair of the lightest neutralino couples to CP-even (light or heavy) Higgs scalars. In particular, the lightest neutralino is assumed to be a dominantly Bino-like mixed state, composed of Bino and Higgsino or Bino, Wino, and Higgsino. After computing all the three-point functions in the electroweak MSSM, we detail the contributions from the counterterms that arise in renormalizing these vertices in one-loop order. The amendment of the renormalized vertices impacts the spin-independent direct detection cross-sections of the scattering of nucleons with dark matter. We perform a comprehensive numerical scan over the parameter space where all the points satisfy the present B-physics constraints and accommodate the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. Finally, we exemplify a few benchmark points, which indulge the present searches of supersymmetric particles. After including the renormalized one-loop vertices, the spin-independent DM-nucleon cross-sections may be enhanced up to $20\%$ compared to its tree-level results. Finally, with the NLO cross-section, we use the recent LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) results on the neutralino-nucleon scattering to display the relative rise in the lowest allowed band of the Higgsino mass parameter in the $M\_1-\mu$ plane of the electroweak MSSM.

2023-11-16, **Radiative Corrections to Aid the Direct Detection of the Higgsino-like Neutralino Dark Matter: Spin-Independent Interactions**, Subhadip Bisal et.al., [2311.09937v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09937v1)

 The lightest neutralino ($\tilde{\chi}\_1^0$) is a good Dark Matter (DM) candidate in the R-parity conserving Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). In this work, we consider the light higgsino-like neutralino as the Lightest Stable Particle (LSP), thanks to rather small higgsino mass parameter $\mu$. We then estimate the prominent radiative corrections to the neutralino-neutralino-Higgs boson vertices. We show that for higgsino-like $\tilde{\chi}\_1^0$, these corrections can significantly influence the spin-independent direct detection cross-section, even contributing close to 100\% in certain regions of the parameter space. These corrections, therefore, play an important role in deducing constraints on the mass of the higgsino-like lightest neutralino DM, and thus the $\mu$ parameter.

2023-11-16, **Probing cosmology via the clustering of critical points**, Junsup Shim et.al., [2311.09886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09886v1)

 Exclusion zones in the cross-correlations between critical points (peak-void, peak-wall, filament-wall, filament-void) of the density field define quasi-standard rulers that can be used to constrain dark matter and dark energy cosmological parameters. The average size of the exclusion zone is found to scale linearly with the typical distance between extrema. The latter changes as a function of the matter content of the universe in a predictable manner, but its comoving size remains essentially constant in the linear regime of structure growth on large scales, unless the incorrect cosmology is assumed in the redshift-distance relation. This can be used to constrain the dark energy parameters when considering a survey that scans a range of redshifts. The precision of the parameter estimation is assessed using a set of cosmological simulations, and is found to be a 4$\sigma$ detection of a change in matter content of 5%, or about 3.8$\sigma$ detection of 50% shift in the dark energy parameter using a full sky survey up to redshift 0.5.

2023-11-16, **Sensitivity to keV-MeV dark matter from cosmic-ray scattering with current and the upcoming ground-based arrays CTA and SWGO**, Igor Reis et.al., [2311.09688v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09688v1)

 A wealth of astrophysical and cosmological observational evidence shows that the matter content of the universe is made of about 85$\%$ of non-baryonic dark matter. Huge experimental efforts have been deployed to look for the direct detection of dark matter via their scattering on target nucleons, their production in colliders, and their indirect detection via their annihilation products. Inelastic scattering of high-energy cosmic rays off dark matter particles populating the Milky Way halo would produce secondary gamma rays in the final state from the decay of the neutral pions produced in such interactions, providing a new avenue to probe dark matter properties. We compute here the sensitivity for H.E.S.S.-like observatory, a current-generation ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, to the expected gamma-ray flux from collisions of Galactic cosmic rays and dark matter in the center of the Milky Way. We also derive sensitivity prospects for the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO). The expected sensitivity allows us to probe a poorly-constrained range of dark matter masses so far, ranging from keV to sub-GeV, and provide complementary constraints on the dark matter-proton scattering cross section traditionally probed by deep underground direct dark matter experiments.

2023-11-16, **Search for Charged Excited States of Dark Matter with KamLAND-Zen**, KamLAND-Zen collaboration et.al., [2311.09676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09676v1)

 Particle dark matter could belong to a multiplet that includes an electrically charged state. WIMP dark matter ($\chi^{0}$) accompanied by a negatively charged excited state ($\chi^{-}$) with a small mass difference (e.g. $<$ 20 MeV) can form a bound-state with a nucleus such as xenon. This bound-state formation is rare and the released energy is $\mathcal{O}(1-10$) MeV depending on the nucleus, making large liquid scintillator detectors suitable for detection. We searched for bound-state formation events with xenon in two experimental phases of the KamLAND-Zen experiment, a xenon-doped liquid scintillator detector. No statistically significant events were observed. For a benchmark parameter set of WIMP mass $m\_{\chi^{0}} = 1$ TeV and mass difference $\Delta m = 17$ MeV, we set the most stringent upper limits on the recombination cross section times velocity $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ and the decay-width of $\chi^{-}$ to $9.2 \times 10^{-30}$ ${\rm cm^3/s}$ and $8.7 \times 10^{-14}$ GeV, respectively at 90% confidence level.

2023-11-16, **A general approach to backaction-evading receivers with magnetomechanical and electromechanical sensors**, Brittany Richman et.al., [2311.09587v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09587v1)

 Today's mechanical sensors are capable of detecting extremely weak perturbations while operating near the standard quantum limit. However, further improvements can be made in both sensitivity and bandwidth when we reduce the noise originating from the process of measurement itself -- the quantum-mechanical backaction of measurement -- and go below this 'standard' limit, possibly approaching the Heisenberg limit. One of the ways to eliminate this noise is by measuring a quantum nondemolition variable such as the momentum in a free-particle system. Here, we propose and characterize theoretical models for direct velocity measurement that utilize traditional electric and magnetic transducer designs to generate a signal while enabling this backaction evasion. We consider the general readout of this signal via electric or magnetic field sensing by creating toy models analogous to the standard optomechanical position-sensing problem, thereby facilitating the assessment of measurement-added noise. Using simple models that characterize a wide range of transducers, we find that the choice of readout scheme -- voltage or current -- for each mechanical detector configuration implies access to either the position or velocity of the mechanical sub-system. This in turn suggests a path forward for key fundamental physics experiments such as the direct detection of dark matter particles.

2023-11-16, **Direct detections of the Axion-like particle Revisited**, Wei Chao et.al., [2311.09547v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09547v1)

 Axion-like particles (ALPs) are promising dark matter candidates. Their signals in direct detection experiments arise from the well-known inverse Primakoff effect or the inverse Compton scattering of the ALPs with the electron. In this paper, we revisit the direct detection of ALP by carefully considering the interference between the inverse Primakoff amplitude and the inverse Compton amplitude in the scattering process $a+e \to e+\gamma$ for the first time. It shows that the contribution of the interference term turns to be dominated in the scattering for a large ALP energy. Given the new analytical formula, signals or constraints of ALP couplings in various projected experiments are investigated. Our results show that these experiments may put strong constraints on ALP couplings for relatively heavy ALP. We further study projected constraints on the ALP from the JUNO experiment, which shows competitive constraints on ALP couplings using a ten-year exposure.

2023-11-16, **Super heavy dark matter from inflationary Schwinger production**, Mar Bastero-Gil et.al., [2311.09475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09475v1)

 We consider a simple setup with a dark sector containing dark electrons charged under an abelian $U(1)\_D$ gauge symmetry. We show that if the massless dark photon associated to the $U(1)\_D$ is produced during inflation in such a way as to form a classical dark electric field, then dark electron-positron pairs are also produced close to the end of inflation via the Schwinger mechanism. Their mass is larger than the Hubble scale so they are non-relativistic at production and remain so for the rest of their cosmic evolution following reheating. They can account for the dark matter abundance today in scenarios with a high scale of inflation and efficient reheating.This points to a very heavy mass for the dark electrons of order $10^{14}$ GeV. Even with a dark gauge coupling comparable to the visible one of electromagnetism, the dark electrons are so heavy that they do not thermalize with the dark photons throughout their cosmic history. Assuming negligible kinetic mixing with the visible $U(1)$ the dark electrons remain decoupled from the Standard Model thermal bath as well.

2023-11-16, **JADES: Carbon enrichment 350 Myr after the Big Bang in a gas-rich galaxy**, Francesco D'Eugenio et.al., [2311.09908v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09908v1)

 Finding the emergence of the first generation of metals in the early Universe, and identifying their origin, are some of the most important goals of modern astrophysics. We present deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GS-z12, a galaxy at z=12.5, in which we report the detection of C III]${\lambda}{\lambda}$1907,1909 nebular emission. This is the most distant detection of a metal transition and the most distant redshift determination via emission lines. In addition, we report tentative detections of [O II]${\lambda}{\lambda}$3726,3729 and [Ne III]${\lambda}$3869, and possibly O III]${\lambda}{\lambda}$1661,1666. By using the accurate redshift from C III], we can model the Ly${\alpha}$ drop to reliably measure an absorbing column density of hydrogen of $N\_{HI} \approx 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ - too high for an IGM origin and implying abundant ISM in GS-z12 or CGM around it. We infer a lower limit for the neutral gas mass of about $10^7$ MSun which, compared with a stellar mass of $\approx4 \times 10^7$ MSun inferred from the continuum fitting, implies a gas fraction higher than about 0.1-0.5. We derive a solar or even super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio, tentatively [C/O]>0.15. This is higher than the C/O measured in galaxies discovered by JWST at z=6-9, and higher than the C/O arising from Type-II supernovae enrichment, while AGB stars cannot contribute to carbon enrichment at these early epochs and low metallicities. Such a high C/O in a galaxy observed 350 Myr after the Big Bang may be explained by the yields of extremely metal poor stars, and may even be the heritage of the first generation of supernovae from Population III progenitors.

2023-11-16, **Dancing with the stars: a review on stellar multiplicity**, Thibault Merle et.al., [2311.09764v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09764v1)

 Stars like company. They are mostly formed in clusters and their lives are often altered by the presence of one or more companions. Interaction processes between components may lead to complex outcomes like Algols, blue stragglers, chemically altered stars, type Ia supernovae, as well as progenitors of gravitational wave sources, to cite a few. Observational astronomy has entered the era of big data, and thanks to large surveys like spatial missions Kepler, TESS, Gaia, and ground-based spectroscopic surveys like RAVE, Gaia-ESO, APOGEE, LAMOST, GALAH (to name a few) the field is going through a true revolution, as illustrated by the recent detection of stellar black holes and neutron stars as companions of massive but also low-mass stars. In this review, I will present why it is important to care about stellar multiples, what are the main large surveys in which many binaries are harvested, and finally present some features related to the largest catalogue of astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries provided by the Non-Single Star catalogue of Gaia, which is, to date, the largest homogeneous catalogue of stellar binaries.

2023-11-16, **Chemodynamical study of two CEMP-no stars from the Hamburg/ESO Survey**, J. Shejeelammal et.al., [2311.09530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09530v1)

 The Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars with no enhancement of neutron-capture elements, the so-called CEMP-no stars are believed to be the direct descendants of first-generation stars and provide a unique opportunity to probe the early Galactic nucleosynthesis. We present a detailed chemical and kinematic analysis for two extremely metal-poor stars HE1243$-$2408 and HE0038$-$0345 using high-resolution (R${\sim}$86,000) HERMES spectra. For the object HE1243$-$2408, we could make a detailed comparison with the available literature values; however, only limited information is available for the other object HE0038$-$0345. Our estimated metallicity for these two objects are $-$3.05 and $-$2.92 respectively. With estimated [C/Fe] (1.03 and 1.05) and [Ba/Fe] ($-$0.18 and $-$0.11) respectively, the objects are found to be bonafide CEMP-no stars. From the observed abundances of C, Na, Mg, and Ba (i.e., A(C), A(Na), A(Mg), A(Ba)), the objects are found to belong to Group II CEMP-no stars. A detailed abundance profile analysis indicates that the objects are accreted from dSph satellite galaxies that support hierarchical Galaxy assembly. Further, our analysis shows that the progenitors of the stars are likely Pop II Core-Collapse Supernovae. The object HE0038$-$0345 is found to be a high-energy, prograde, outer-halo object, and HE1243$-$2408 is found to be a high-energy, retrograde, inner-halo object. Our detailed chemodynamical analysis shows that HE1243$-$2408 is related to I'itoi structure, where as HE0038$-$0345 is likely related to Sgr or GSE events. The mass of the progenitor galaxies of the program stars inferred from their dynamics is at par with their likely origin in massive dSph galaxies.
