2024-02-19, **Development of KI-TWPAs for the DARTWARS project**, Felix Ahrens et.al., [2402.12295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12295v1)

 Noise at the quantum limit over a broad bandwidth is a fundamental requirement for future cryogenic experiments for neutrino mass measurements, dark matter searches and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements as well as for fast high-fidelity read-out of superconducting qubits. In the last years, Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPA) have demonstrated noise levels close to the quantum limit, but due to their narrow bandwidth, only few detectors or qubits per line can be read out in parallel. An alternative and innovative solution is based on superconducting parametric amplification exploiting the travelling-wave concept. Within the DARTWARS (Detector Array Readout with Travelling Wave AmplifieRS) project, we develop Kinetic Inductance Travelling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) for low temperature detectors and qubit read-out. KI-TWPAs are typically operated in a threewave mixing (3WM) mode and are characterised by a high gain, a high saturation power, a large amplification bandwidth and nearly quantum limited noise performance. The goal of the DARTWARS project is to optimise the KI-TWPA design, explore new materials, and investigate alternative fabrication processes in order to enhance the overall performance of the amplifier. In this contribution we present the advancements made by the DARTWARS collaboration to produce a working prototype of a KI-TWPA, from the fabrication to the characterisation.

2024-02-19, **BINGO innovative assembly for background reduction in bolometric $0νββ$ experiments**, A. Armatol et.al., [2402.12262v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12262v1)

 BINGO is a project aiming to set the grounds for large-scale bolometric neutrinoless double-beta-decay experiments capable of investigating the effective Majorana neutrino mass at a few meV level. It focuses on developing innovative technologies to achieve a very low background index, of the order of $10^{-5}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the region of interest. The BINGO demonstrator, called MINI-BINGO, will be composed of Li$\_2$MoO$\_4$ and TeO$\_2$ crystals coupled to bolometric light detectors designed to investigate the promising double-beta-decay isotopes $^{100}$Mo and $^{130}$Te. This will allow us to reject a significant background in bolometers caused by surface contamination from $\alpha$-active radionuclides by means of light yield selection. In addition, BINGO introduces new methods to mitigate other sources of background, such as surface radioactive contamination, external $\gamma$ radioactivity, and pile-up due to random coincidence of background events. This paper focuses on the description of an innovative assembly designed to reduce the passive materials in line of sight of the detectors, which is expected to be a dominant source of background in next-generation bolometric experiments. We present the performance of two prototype modules -- housing four Li$\_2$MoO$\_4$ crystals in total -- operated in the Canfranc underground laboratory in Spain within a facility developed for the CROSS double-beta-decay experiment.

2024-02-19, **Affleck-Dine leptogenesis scenario for resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter**, Kentaro Kasai et.al., [2402.11902v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11902v1)

 Sterile neutrino is a fascinating candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we examine the Affleck-Dine (AD) leptogenesis scenario generating a large lepton asymmetry, which can induce the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter via the Shi-Fuller (SF) mechanism. We also revisit the numerical calculation of the SF mechanism and the constraints from current X-ray and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We find that the AD leptogenesis scenario can explain the production of sterile neutrino dark matter by incorporating a non-topological soliton with a lepton charge called L-ball. Finally, we discuss an enhancement of second-order gravitational waves at the L-ball decay and investigate the testability of our scenario with future gravitational wave observations.

2024-02-19, **Towards Cosmography of the Local Universe**, Julian Adamek et.al., [2402.12165v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12165v1)

 Anisotropies in the distance-redshift relation of cosmological sources are expected due to large-scale inhomogeneities in the local Universe. When the observed sources are tracing a large-scale matter flow in a general spacetime geometry, the distance-redshift relation with its anisotropies can be described with a geometrical prediction that generalises the well-known Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker result. Furthermore, it turns out that a finite set of multipole coefficients contain the full information about a finite-order truncation of the distance-redshift relation of a given observer. The multipoles of the distance-redshift relation are interesting new cosmological observables that have a direct physical interpretation in terms of kinematical quantities of the underlying matter flow. Using light cones extracted from $N$-body simulations we quantify the anisotropies expected in a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology by running a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis on the observed data. In this observational approach the survey selection implements an implicit smoothing scale over which the effective rest frame of matter is fitted. The perceived anisotropy therefore depends significantly on the redshift range and distribution of sources. We find that the multipoles of the expansion rate, as well as the observer's velocity with respect to the large-scale matter flow, can be determined robustly with our approach.

2024-02-19, **Investigating $ω(z)$ Parametrizations in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity: Observational Constraints with Covariance Matrix Simulation**, Himanshu Chaudhary et.al., [2402.12324v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12324v1)

 This study investigates accelerated cosmic expansion using various cosmological models within Horava-Lifshitz gravity, including BBCCFHKO, Seljak, ASSS, PADE-I, PADE-II, and BAZS, utilizing Equation of State Parametrization. To constrain the cosmological parameters of each model, we incorporate 24 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation points, 30 Cosmic Chronometer points, 40 Type Ia Supernovae points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts points, along with the latest Hubble constant measurement (R22). We treat $r\_{d}$ as a free parameter, aiming to extract $H\_{0}$ and $r\_{d}$ using late-time datasets and obtain optimal fitting values for each parameter in every model. The benefits of treating $r\_{d}$ as a free parameter include reduced bias, improved precision, and enhanced dataset compatibility. The resulting values of $H\_{0}$ and $r\_{d}$ are relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model, showcasing alignment with early Planck and SDSS estimations. We additionally minimize errors by simulating random correlations in the covariance matrix. Furthermore, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) support all models, with the $\Lambda$CDM model exhibiting the lowest AIC. Evaluation via reduced chi-square statistic confirms reasonable fits for all models. While $\Lambda$CDM remains favored, extensions warrant further investigation. This study underscores the importance of exploring alternative cosmological models to deepen our understanding of the universe's fundamental properties and evolution. Continued refinement of models is essential for advancing cosmological research.

2024-02-19, **Simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20190520B with Swift and FAST**, Zhen Yan et.al., [2402.12084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12084v1)

 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio bursts of cosmic origin. There have been several dozen FRBs found to repeat. Among them, those precisely localized provide the best opportunity to probe their multi-wavelength counterparts, local environment, and host galaxy that would reveal their origins. Here we report our X-ray, ultraviolet (UV) and optical observations with the $Swift$ satellite that were performed simultaneously in the radio band with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) observations of the repeating FRB 20190520B, aiming at detection of possible multi-wavelength bursts in association with radio bursts and multi-wavelength counterpart of the persistent radio source (PRS). While a total of 10 radio bursts were detected by FAST at the same time of $Swift$ observations, we detected neither X-ray, UV or optical bursts in accompany of the radio bursts, nor persistent multi-wavelength counterpart of the PRS. We obtained the energy upper limits ($3\sigma$) on any multi-wavelength bursts as $5.03 \times 10^{47}$ erg in the hard X-ray band (15-150 keV), $7.98 \times 10^{45}$ erg in the soft X-ray band (0.3-10 keV), and $4.51 \times 10^{44}$ erg in the U band, respectively. The energy ratio between soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) and radio emission of the bursts is constrained as $<6\times10^{7}$, and the ratio between optical (U band) and radio as $<1.19\times10^{6}$. The 3$\sigma$ luminosity upper limits at the position of PRS are 1.04$\times10^{47}$ (15-150 keV), 8.81$\times10^{42}$ (0.3-10 keV), 9.26$\times10^{42}$ (UVW1), and 2.54$\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (U), respectively. We show that the PRS is much more radio loud than representative pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, extended jet of Galactic X-ray binaries and ultraluminous X-ray sources, suggestive of boosted radio emission of the PRS.

2024-02-19, **Revision of the GeV $γ$-ray Emission in the Region of HESS J1813-178 with Fermi-LAT**, Xiaolei Guo et.al., [2402.11880v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11880v1)

 HESS J1813-178 is one of the brightest and most compact TeV $\gamma$-ray sources, and whether its $\gamma$-ray emission is associated with supernova remnant (SNR), pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or young stellar cluster (YSC) is still under debate. By analysing the GeV $\gamma$-ray data in the field of HESS J1813-178 using 14 years of PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we report the discovery of three different sources with different spectra in this region. The hard source with a power law spectral index of 2.11 $\pm$ 0.08 has a small size extension, which is spatially and spectrally coincident with the TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from HESS J1813-178. CO observations display the dense molecular clouds surrounding HESS J1813-178 in the velocity range of 45-60 km s$^{\rm -1}$. The possible origins of the $\gamma$-ray emission from HESS J1813-178 are discussed, including SNR G12.82-0.02, the PWN driven by the energetic X-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1749, and YSC Cl 1813-178. However, none of them can be ruled out clearly. Note that the maximum energy of protons in the hadronic model should exceed a few hundred TeV, which makes HESS J1813-178 to be a promising PeVatron. The detailed LHAASO data analysis about the morphology and spectrum would be helpful to investigate the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission in this region and test its PeVatron nature.
