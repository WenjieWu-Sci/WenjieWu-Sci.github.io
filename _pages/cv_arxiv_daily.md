2023-03-16, **Nucleosynthesis in neutrino-heated ejecta and neutrino-driven winds of core-collapse supernovae; neutrino-induced nucleosynthesis**, Shinya Wanajo et.al., [2303.09442v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09442v1)

 The innermost ejecta of core-collapse supernovae are considered to be the sources of some iron-group and heavier nuclei. The ejecta are predominantly driven by neutrino heating, principally due to neutrino capture on free neutrons and protons. Such neutrino interaction plays a crucial role for setting neutron richness in the ejecta. Recent hydrodynamics work with sophisticated neutrino transport indicates that the ejecta are only mildly neutron rich or even proton rich. In such conditions a wide variety of trans-iron isotopes are synthesized, while the neutron richness is insufficient for the production of r-process nuclei. In this capter, basic concepts of nucleosynthesis in neutrino-heated ejecta and neutrino-driven winds of core-collapse supernovae are presented along with latest studies. Neutrino-heated ejecta indicate the early ejecta component within the first few seocnds in which anisotropic convective activities of material above the neutrinosphere become important for nucleosynthesis. Then, neutrino-driven winds follow, which are approximately isotropic outflows emerging from the surface of a proto-neutron star . According to such characteristics, studies of nucleosynthesis here are based on recent multi-dimentional hydrodynamics simulations and semi-alalytic wind solutions, respectively. These studies suggest that trans-iron species up to the atomic mass number of 90, as well as some rare isotopes such as 48Ca and 92Mo, are produced in the neutrino-heated ejecta. Neutrino-driven winds are unlikely sources of r-process nuclei, but rather promising sources of proton-rich isotopes up to the atomic number of 110.

2023-03-16, **Earth tomography with supernova neutrinos at future neutrino detectors**, Rasmi Hajjar et.al., [2303.09369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09369v1)

 Earth neutrino tomography is a realistic possibility with current and future neutrino detectors, complementary to geophysics methods. The two main approaches are based on either partial absorption of the neutrino flux as it propagates through the Earth (at energies about a few TeV) or on coherent Earth matter effects affecting the neutrino oscillations pattern (at energies below a few tens of GeV). In this work, we consider the latter approach focusing on supernova neutrinos with tens of MeV. Whereas at GeV energies, Earth matter effects are driven by the atmospheric mass-squared difference, at energies below $\sim 100$~MeV, it is the solar mass-squared difference what controls them. Unlike solar neutrinos, which suffer from significant weakening of the contribution to the oscillatory effect from remote structures due to the neutrino energy reconstruction capabilities of detectors, supernova neutrinos can have higher energies and thus, can better probe the Earth's interior. We shall revisit this possibility, using the most recent neutrino oscillation parameters and up-to-date supernova neutrino spectra. The capabilities of future neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande and JUNO are presented, including the impact of the energy resolution and other factors. Assuming a supernova burst at 10~kpc, we show that the average Earth's core density could be determined within $\lesssim 10\%$ at $1\sigma$ confidence level, being Hyper-Kamiokande, with its largest mass, the most promising detector to achieve this goal.

2023-03-16, **Nuclear neutron radius and weak mixing angle measurements from latest COHERENT CsI and atomic parity violation Cs data**, M. Atzori Corona et.al., [2303.09360v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09360v1)

 The COHERENT collaboration observed coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering using a 14.6 kg cesium-iodide (CsI) detector in 2017 and recently published the updated results before decommissioning the detector. Here, we present the legacy determination of the weak mixing angle and of the average neutron rms radius of $^{133}\mathrm{Cs}$ and $^{127}\mathrm{I}$ obtained with the full CsI dataset, also exploiting the combination with the atomic parity violation (APV) experimental result, that allows us to achieve a precision as low as $\sim$4.5\% and to disentangle the contributions of the $^{133}\mathrm{Cs}$ and $^{127}\mathrm{I}$ nuclei. Interestingly, we show that the COHERENT CsI data show a 6$\sigma$ evidence of the nuclear structure suppression of the full coherence. Moreover, we derive a data-driven APV+COHERENT measurement of the low-energy weak mixing angle with a percent uncertainty, independent of the value of the average neutron rms radius of $^{133}\mathrm{Cs}$ and $^{127}\mathrm{I}$, that is allowed to vary freely in the fit. Finally, in light of the recent announcement of a future deployment of a 10~kg and a $\sim$700~kg cryogenic CsI detectors, we provide future prospects for these measurements.

2023-03-16, **Rapidly growing primordial black holes as seeds of the massive high-redshift JWST Galaxies**, Guan-Wen Yuan et.al., [2303.09391v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09391v1)

 A group of massive galaxies at redshifts of $z\geq 6.5$ have been recently detected by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which were unexpected to form at such early times within the standard Big Bang cosmology. In this work we propose that the formation of some $\sim 50~M\_\odot$ primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe via super-Eddington accretion within the dark matter halo can explain these observations. These PBHs may act as seeds for early galaxies formation with masses of $\sim 10^{9}-10^{10}~M\_\odot$ at $z\sim 8$, hence accounting for the JWST observations. We use a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to constrain the PBH mass distribution models, and find that the Lognormal model with the $M\_{\rm c}\sim 35M\_\odot$ is strongly preferred over other hypotheses. These rapidly growing BHs are expected to have strong radiation and may appear as the high-redshift compact objects, similar to those recently discovered by JWST.

2023-03-16, **Accreting Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Constituents**, T. Kenneth Fowler et.al., [2303.09341v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09341v1)

 We show how magnetic accretion of positronium (electron-positron) plasma by primordial black holes might significantly contribute to the mass of dark matter in the present Universe. Assuming that background gamma radiation is primordial black hole Hawking radiation rules out Bondi accretion, while magnetic accretion known from studies of active galactic nuclei could explain the abundance of dark matter. Various accretion scenarios are discussed.

2023-03-16, **Exploring dark matter spike distribution around the Galactic centre with stellar orbits**, Zhao-Qiang Shen et.al., [2303.09284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09284v1)

 Precise measurements of the stellar orbits around Sagittarius A* have established the existence of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic centre (GC). Due to the interplay between the SMBH and dark matter (DM), the DM density profile in the innermost region of the Galaxy, which is crucial for the DM indirect detection, is still an open question. Among the most popular models in the literature, the theoretical spike profile proposed by Gondolo and Silk (1999; GS hereafter) is well adopted. In this work, we investigate the DM spike profile using updated data from the Keck and VLT telescopes considering that the presence of such an extended mass component may affect the orbits of the S-stars in the Galactic center. We examine the radius and slope of the generalized NFW spike profile, analyze the Einasto spike, and discuss the influence of DM annihilation on the results. Our findings indicate that an initial slope of $\gamma \gtrsim 0.92$ for the generalized NFW spike profile is ruled out at a 95% confidence level. Additionally, the spike radius $R\_{\rm sp}$ larger than 21.5 pc is rejected at 95% probability for the Einasto spike with $\alpha=0.17$, which also contradicts the GS spike model. The constraints with the VLT/GRAVITY upper limits are also projected. Although the GS NFW spike is well constrained by the Keck and VLT observation of S2, an NFW spike with a weak annihilation cusp may still be viable, as long as the DM annihilation cross section satisfies $\left< \sigma v \right> \gtrsim 7.7\times 10^{-27}~{\rm cm^3\,s^{-1}} (m\_{\rm DM}/100~{\rm GeV})$ at 95% level.

2023-03-16, **The Gravitational Ringing of a Spherically Symmetric Black Hole Surrounded by Dark Matter Spike**, Yuqian Zhao et.al., [2303.09215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09215v1)

 Supermassive black holes at the center of each galaxy may be surrounded by dark matter. Such dark matter admits a spike structure and vanishes at a certain distance from the black hole. This dark matter will impact the spacetime near the black hole and the related ringing gravitational waves can show distinguished features to the black hole without dark matter. In the present work, we calculate the quasi-normal modes who dominate the ringdown process of the perturbed black holes surrounded by dark matter spike. We find that the isospectrality for black holes with dark matter spike will break down. And more the relative ringing frequency difference between the black holes with and without dark matter can be as large as $10^{-2}$. These features can be used in future gravitational wave detection about extremal mass ratio inspiral systems to probe the existence of dark matter around supermassive black holes.

2023-03-16, **Evidence for a stable supermassive gravitino with charge 2/3?**, Krzysztof A. Meissner et.al., [2303.09131v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09131v1)

 Some time ago it was suggested that dark matter may consist in part of an extremely dilute gas of supermassive fractionally charged gravitinos \cite{MeissnerNicolai2019}. This scheme makes the definite (and falsifiable) prediction that massive gravitinos are the only new fermionic degrees of freedom beyond the known three generations of quarks and leptons of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. In this note we re-examine one special event reported and subsequently discarded by the MACRO collaboration \cite{MACRO,MACRO1} in the light of this proposal.

2023-03-16, **The EUCLID NISP grisms flight models performance**, Anne Costille et.al., [2303.09130v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09130v1)

 ESA EUCLID mission will be launched in 2020 to understand the nature of the dark energy responsible of the accelerated expansion of the Universe and to map the geometry of the dark matter. The map will investigate the distanceredshift relationship and the evolution of cosmic structures thanks to two instruments: the NISP and the VIS. The NISP (Near Infrared Spectro-Photometer) is operating in the near-IR spectral range (0.9-2$\mu$m) with two observing modes: the photometric mode for the acquisition of images with broad band filters, and the spectroscopic mode for the acquisition of slitless dispersed images on the detectors. The spectroscopic mode uses four low resolution grisms to cover two spectral ranges: three ''red'' grisms for 1250-1850nm range, with three different orientations, and one ''blue'' grism for 920- 1300nm range. The NISP grisms are complex optical components combining four main optical functions: a grism function (dispersion without beam deviation of the first diffracted order) done by the grating on the prism hypotenuse, a spectral filter done by a multilayer filter deposited on the first face of the prism to select the spectral bandpass, a focus function done by the curved filter face of the prism (curvature radius of 10m) and a spectral wavefront correction done by the grating which grooves paths are nor parallel, neither straight. The development of these components have been started since 10 years at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM) and was linked to the project phases: prototypes have been developed to demonstrate the feasibility, then engineering and qualification models to validate the optical and mechanical performance of the component, finally the flight models have been manufactured and tested and will be installed on NISP instrument. In this paper, we present the optical performance of the four EUCLID NISP grisms flight models characterized at LAM: wavefront error, spectral transmission and grating groove profiles. The test devices and the methods developed for the characterization of these specific optical components are described. The analysis of the test results have shown that the grisms flight models for NISP are within specifications with an efficiency better than 70% on the spectral bandpass and a wavefront error on surfaces better than 30nm RMS. The components have withstood vibration qualification level up to 11.6g RMS in random test and vacuum cryogenics test down to 130K with measurement of optical quality in transmission. The EUCLID grisms flight models have been delivered to NISP project in November 2017 after the test campaign done at LAM that has demonstrated the compliance to the specifications.

2023-03-16, **Analysis of Dark Matter Halo Structure Formation in $N$-body Simulations with Machine Learning**, Jazhiel Chacón et.al., [2303.09098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09098v1)

 The properties of the matter density field in the initial conditions have a decisive impact on the features of the large-scale structure of the Universe as observed today. These need to be studied via $N$-body simulations, which are imperative to analyze high density collapsed regions into dark matter halos. In this paper, we train Machine Learning algorithms with information from N -body simulations to infer two properties: dark matter particle halo classification that leads to halo formation prediction with the characteristics of the matter density field traced back to the initial conditions, and dark matter halo formation by calculating the Halo Mass Function (HMF), which offers the number density of dark matter halos with a given threshold. We map the initial conditions of the matter density field into classification labels of dark matter halo structures. The Halo Mass Function of the simulations is calculated and reconstructed with theoretical methods as well as our trained algorithms. We test several Machine Learning techniques where we could find that the Random Forest and Neural Networks proved to be the better performing tools to classify dark matter particles in cosmological simulations. We also show that that it is not compulsory to use a high amount of data to train the algorithms in order to reconstruct the HMF, giving us a very good fitting function for both simulation and theoretical results.

2023-03-16, **Photometric study of the late-time near-infrared plateau in Type Ia supernovae**, M. Deckers et.al., [2303.09548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09548v1)

 We present an in-depth study of the late-time near-infrared plateau in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which occurs between 70-500 d. We double the existing sample of SNe Ia observed during the late-time near-infrared plateau with new observations taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, Gemini, New Technology Telescope, the 3.5m Calar Alto Telescope, and the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our sample consists of 24 nearby SNe Ia at redshift < 0.025. We are able to confirm that no plateau exists in the Ks band for most normal SNe Ia. SNe Ia with broader optical light curves at peak tend to have a higher average brightness on the plateau in J and H, most likely due to a shallower decline in the preceding 100 d. SNe Ia that are more luminous at peak also show a steeper decline during the plateau phase in H. We compare our data to state-of-the-art radiative transfer models of nebular SNe Ia in the near-infrared. We find good agreement with the sub-Mch model that has reduced non-thermal ionisation rates, but no physical justification for reducing these rates has yet been proposed. An analysis of the spectral evolution during the plateau demonstrates that the ratio of [Fe II] to [Fe III] contribution in a near-infrared filter determines the light curve evolution in said filter. We find that overluminous SNe decline slower during the plateau than expected from the trend seen for normal SNe Ia

2023-03-16, **The Origin of the Large Magellanic Cloud Globular Cluster NGC 2005**, Andrés E. Piatti et.al., [2303.09259v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09259v1)

 The ancient Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) globular cluster NGC 2005 has recently been reported to have an ex-situ origin, thus, setting precedents that the LMC could have partially formed from smaller merged dwarf galaxies. We here provide additional arguments from which we conclude that is also fairly plausible an in-situ origin of NGC 2005, based on the abundance spread of a variety of chemical elements measured in dwarf galaxies, their minimum mass in order to form globular clusters, the globular cluster formation imprints kept in their kinematics, and the recent modeling showing that explosions of supernovae are responsible for the observed chemical abundance spread in dwarf galaxies. The present analysis points to the need for further development of numerical simulations and observational indices that can help us to differentiate between two mechanisms of galaxy formation for the LMC, namely, a primordial dwarf or an initial merging event of smaller dwarfs.

2023-03-16, **Overall Binary Evolution Theory**, Diogo Belloni et.al., [2303.08997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08997v1)

 Accreting compact objects are crucial to understand several important astrophysical phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae, gravitational waves, or X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bursts. In addition, they are natural laboratories to infer fundamental properties of stars, to investigate high-energy phenomena and accretion processes, to test theories of stellar and binary evolution, to explore interactions between high-density plasma and very strong magnetic fields, to examine the interplay between binary evolution and dynamical interactions (in the case they belong to dense star clusters), and they can even be used as a probe for the assembling process of galaxies over cosmic time-scales. Despite the fundamental importance of accreting compact objects for astrophysics and recent progress with the comprehension of these fascinating objects, we still do not fully understand how they form and evolve. In this chapter, we will review the current theoretical status of our knowledge on these objects, and will discuss standing problems and potential solutions to them.
