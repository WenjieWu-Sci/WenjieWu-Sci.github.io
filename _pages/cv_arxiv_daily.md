2023-04-18, **A practical guide to a moment approach for neutrino transport in numerical relativity**, Carlo Musolino et.al., [2304.09168v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09168v1)

 The development of a neutrino moment based radiative-transfer code to simulate binary neutron-star mergers can easily become an obstacle path because of the numerous ways in which the solution of the equations may fail. We describe the implementation of the grey M1 scheme in our fully general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code and detail those choices and strategies that could lead either to a robust scheme or to a series of failures. In addition, we present new tests designed to show the consistency and accuracy of our code in conditions that are similar to realistic merging conditions and introduce a new, publicly available, benchmark based on the head-on collision of two neutron stars. This test, which is computationally less expensive than a complete merging binary but has all the potential pitfalls of the full scenario, can be used to compare future implementations of M1 schemes with the one presented here.

2023-04-17, **Gravity-improved metastability bounds for the Type-I Seesaw Mechanism**, Garv Chauhan et.al., [2304.08542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08542v1)

 Right-handed neutrinos (RHN) destabilize the electroweak vacuum by increasing its decay rate. In the SM, the latter is dominated by physics at the RG scale at which $\lambda$ reaches its minimum, $\mu\_*^{\text{SM}} \sim 10^{17}$ GeV. RHNs generically push $\mu\_*$ beyond the Planck scale, implying that gravitational effects need to be taken into account. In this work, we perform the first comprehensive study of electroweak vacuum metastability in the type-I seesaw mechanism including these effects. Our analysis covers both low- and high-scale seesaw models, with two as well as three RHNs and for multiple values of the Higgs' non-minimal coupling to gravity. We find that gravitational effects can significantly stabilize the vacuum, leading to weaker metastability bounds. We show that metastability sets the strongest bounds for low-scale seesaws with $M\_N>1$ TeV. For high-scale seesaws, we find upper bounds on the allowed masses for the RHNs, which are relevant for high-scale leptogenesis. We also point out that $\text{Tr}(Y\_\nu^\dagger Y\_\nu)$, which is commonly used to express these metastability bounds, cannot be used for all of parameter space. Instead, we argue that bounds can always be expressed reliably through $\text{Tr}(Y\_\nu^\dagger Y\_\nu\,Y\_\nu^\dagger Y\_\nu)$. Lastly, we use this insight to develop a new technique for an easier RG analysis applicable to scenarios with degenerate RHN masses.

2023-04-17, **Astrophysical neutrino point sources as a probe of new physics**, C. Döring et.al., [2304.08533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08533v1)

 Recently, the IceCube collaboration observed a neutrino excess in the direction of NGC 1068 with high statistical significance. This constitutes the second detection of an astrophysical neutrino point source after the discovery of a variable emission originating from the blazar TXS~0506+056. Neutrinos emitted by these sources traverse huge, well-determined distances on their way to Earth. This makes them a promising tool to test new physics in the neutrino sector. We consider secret interactions with the cosmic neutrino background and discuss their impact on the flux of neutrino point sources. The observation of emission from NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 can then be used to put limits on the strength of the interaction. We find that our ignorance of the absolute neutrino masses has a strong impact and, therefore, we present limits in two benchmark scenarios with the sum of the neutrino masses around their lower and upper limits.

2023-04-17, **Big Bang initial conditions and self-interacting hidden dark matter**, Jinzheng Li et.al., [2304.08454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08454v1)

 A variety of supergravity and string models involve hidden sectors where the hidden sectors may couple feebly with the visible sectors via a variety of portals. While the coupling of the hidden sector to the visible sector is feeble its coupling to the inflaton is largely unknown. It could couple feebly or with the same strength as the visible sector which would result in either a cold or a hot hidden sector at the end of reheating. These two possibilities could lead to significantly different outcomes for observables. We investigate the thermal evolution of the two sectors in a cosmologically consistent hidden sector dark matter model where the hidden sector and the visible sector are thermally coupled and their thermal evolution occurs without the assumption of separate entropy conservation for each sector. Within this framework we analyze several phenomena to illustrate their dependence on the initial conditions. These include the allowed parameter space of models, dark matter relic density, proton-dark matter cross section, effective massless neutrino species at BBN time, self-interacting dark matter cross-section, where self-interaction occurs via exchange of dark photon, and Sommerfeld enhancement. Finally fits to the velocity dependence of dark matter cross sections from galaxy scales to the scale of galaxy clusters is given. The analysis indicates significant effects of the initial conditions on the observables listed above. The analysis is carried out within the framework where dark matter is constituted of dark fermions and the mediation between the visible and the hidden sector occurs via the exchange of dark photons. The techniques discussed here may have applications for a wider class of hidden sector models using different mediations between the visible and the hidden sectors to explore the impact of Big Bang initial conditions on observable physics.

2023-04-17, **Low Seesaw Scale Solution for $M_W$ and $(g-2)_μ$**, A. de Giorgi et.al., [2304.08438v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08438v1)

 In this short talk, we present a renormalizable model that can i) generate neutrino masses via a low-scale seesaw mechanism and ii) solve the long-standing $(g-2)\_\mu$ and the more recent CDF II $M\_W$-anomalies. This is minimally achieved by introducing two sterile neutrinos and a single electroweak-doublet vector-like lepton, with masses $< 2$ TeV. We focus on the one-generation scenario and the requirements to extend it to three generations.

2023-04-17, **NvDEx-100 Conceptual Design Report**, X. Cao et.al., [2304.08362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08362v1)

 The measurement of nuclear neutrinoless double-beta decay would be a revolutionary result in particle physics. The observation of such a decay would prove that the neutrinos are their own antiparticles, help to study the absolute mass of neutrinos, explore the origin of their mass, and may explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in our universe by the violation of lepton number. We propose to develop a time projection chamber (TPC) using high-pressure 82SeF6 gas and the top-metal silicon sensors for read-out in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of 82Se, called the NvDEx experiment. Besides located at CJPL with world's deepest rock shielding, NvDEx combines the advantages of the high Q value (2.996 MeV) of 82Se and TPC's ability to distinguish signal and background events using their different topological characteristics. These give NvDEx unique and great potential for low background and high sensitivity. NvDEx-100, the NvDEx experiment phase with 100 kg of SeF6 gas, is being built and planned to complete with installation at CJPL around year 2025. This report will introduce the neutrinoless double-beta decay physics, NvDEx concept and its advantages, the schematic design of NvDEx-100 and its sub-systems, as well as the background and sensitivity estimation for it.

2023-04-17, **Constraints on NJL four-fermion effective interactions from neutrinoless double beta decay**, Luca Pacioselli et.al., [2304.08042v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08042v1)

 We study the contribution of a heavy right-handed Majorana neutrino to neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) via four-fermion effective interactions of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type. In this physical scenario, the sterile neutrino contributes to the nuclear transition through gauge, contact, and mixed interactions. Using the lower limit on the half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ from the KamLAND-Zen experiment, we then constrain the effective right-handed coupling between the sterile neutrino and the $W$ boson: $\mathcal{G}^{W}\_{R}$. Eventually, we show that the obtained bounds are compatible with those found in the literature, which highlights the complementarity of this type of phenomenological study with high-energy experiments.

2023-04-17, **Revisiting the Lithium abundance problem in Big-Bang nucleosynthesis**, Vinay Singh et.al., [2304.08032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08032v1)

 One of the three testaments in favor of the big bang theory is the prediction of the primordial elemental abundances in the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). The Standard BBN is a parameter-free theory due to the precise knowledge of the baryon-to-photon ratio of the Universe obtained from studies of the anisotropies of cosmic microwave background radiation. Although the computed abundances of light elements during primordial nucleosynthesis and those determined from observations are in good agreement throughout a range of nine orders of magnitude, there is still a disparity of $^7$Li abundance overestimated by a factor of $\sim 2.5$ when calculated theoretically. The number of light neutrino flavors, the neutron lifetime and the baryon-to-photon ratio in addition to the astrophysical nuclear reaction rates determine the primordial abundances. We previously looked into the impact of updating baryon-to-photon ratio and neutron lifetime and changing quite a few reaction rates on the yields of light element abundances in BBN. In this work, calculations are performed using new reaction rates for $^3$H(p,$\gamma$)$^4$He, $^6$Li(p,$\gamma$)$^7$Be, $^7$Be(p,$\gamma$)$^8$B, $^{13}$N(p,$\gamma$)$^{14}$O, $^7$Li(n,$\gamma$)$^8$Li and $^{11}$B(n,$\gamma$)$^{12}$B along with the latest measured value of neutron lifetime. We observe from theoretical calculations that these changes result in marginal improvement over a sizable twelve percent reduction in the abundance of $^7$Li achieved earlier.

2023-04-17, **Grand unification, small vs large representations, hadron colliders and all that**, Goran Senjanović et.al., [2304.07932v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07932v1)

 We review minimal realistic grand unified models based on $SU(5)$ and $SO(10)$ gauge groups. The models with small Higgs representations and higher dimensional operators - under the assumption of no cancellations in proton decay amplitudes - predict nearby oases with new light particles. Two of them stand out: real fermion and scalar weak triplets. The former generates dynamically neutrino Majorana mass through the so-called type III seesaw mechanism, while the latter naturally gets a small vacuum expectation value and thus generically modifies $W$-boson mass. On the contrary, the renormalisable versions of these theories fail to determine the particle spectra. In particular, in the renormalisable version of the $SO(10)$ theory the mass of the right-handed gauge boson - normally assumed (and allowed) to lie far in the desert - could be even accessible at the LHC. Last but not least, we show that in the minimal supersymmetric $SU(5)$ theory all the superpartners can lie orders of magnitude above the weak scale, unless one requires strict naturalness. Thus, the so-called split supersymmetry does not imply any light states.

2023-04-18, **Evolution of matter and galaxy clustering in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations**, Jaan Einasto et.al., [2304.09035v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09035v1)

 We quantify the evolution of matter and galaxy clustering in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations via correlation and bias functions of matter and galaxies. We use simulations TNG100 and TNG300 with epochs from $z=5$ to $z=0$. We calculate spatial correlation functions of galaxies, $\xi(r)$, for simulated galaxies and dark matter (DM) particles to characterise the evolving cosmic web. We find that bias parameters decrease during the evolution, confirming earlier results. At low and medium luminosities, bias parameters of galaxies, $b\_0$, are equal, suggesting that dwarf galaxies reside in the same filamentary web as brighter galaxies. Bias parameters of the lowest luminosity galaxies estimated from CFs are lower relative to CFs of particle density-limited clustered samples of DM. We find that bias parameters $b\_0$, estimated from CFs of clustered DM, agree with the expected values from the fraction of particles in the clustered population, $b=1/F\_c$. The cosmic web contains filamentary structures of various densities, and fractions of matter in the clustered and the unclustered populations are both less than unity. Thus the CF amplitude of the clustered matter is always higher than for all matter, i.e. bias parameter must be $b>1$. Differences between CFs of galaxies and clustered DM suggest that these functions describe different properties of the cosmic web.

2023-04-18, **LIGO-VIRGO constraints on dark matter and leptogenesis triggered by a first order phase transition at high scale**, Debasish Borah et.al., [2304.08888v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08888v1)

 We study the possibility of constraining a scenario with high scale first order phase transition (FOPT) responsible for the cogenesis of baryon and dark matter using gravitational wave (GW) (non)-observations. While the FOPT at high scale is responsible for generating baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis and dark matter via the \textit{mass-gain} mechanism, the resulting GW spectrum falls within the ongoing LIGO-VIRGO experimental sensitivity. The dark matter is preferred to be in the non-thermal ballpark with sub-GeV masses and the criteria of successful dark matter relic rules out a large portion of the parameter space consistent with high scale FOPT and successful leptogenesis. Some part of the parameter space allowed from dark matter and leptogenesis criteria also gives rise to a large signal-to-noise ratio at ongoing experiments and hence can be disfavoured in a conservative way from the non-observation of such stochastic GW background. Future data from ongoing and planned experiments will offer a complementary and indirect probe of the remaining parameter space which is typically outside the reach of any direct experimental probe.

2023-04-18, **A Dark Matter Probe in Accreting Pulsar-Black Hole Binaries**, Ali Akil et.al., [2304.08824v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08824v1)

 The accretion of dark matter (DM) into astrophysical black holes slowly increases their mass. The rate of this mass accretion depends on the DM model and the model parameters. If this mass accretion effect can be measured accurately enough, it is possible to rule out some DM models, and, with the sufficient technology and the help of other DM constraints, possibly confirm one model. We propose a DM probe based on accreting pulsar-black hole binaries, which provide a high-precision measurement on binary orbital phase shifts induced by DM accretion into black holes, and can help rule out DM models and study the nature of DM.

2023-04-18, **The impact of halo concentration on the Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect signal from massive galaxy clusters**, Eric J. Baxter et.al., [2304.08731v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08731v1)

 The Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect is sensitive to the pressure of ionized gas inside galaxy clusters. The gas pressure responds to changes in the gravitational potential of the cluster, which is dominated by the host dark matter halo. Changes in halo concentration therefore impact the SZ signal, with implications for cosmological and other analyses of SZ-selected clusters. We investigate the concentration-SZ relation in theory and simulations. We find that the impact of concentration on the inner SZ profile ($R \lesssim 0.75 R\_{200c}$) can be captured with standard polytropic gas models. However, we find that such models do a poor job of reproducing the outer SZ profiles ($R \gtrsim 0.75 R\_{200c}$) and the relation between the integrated SZ signal, $Y$, and concentration. This disagreement results from a sharp truncation of the gas pressure profile near the splashback radius, likely caused by virial shocks. We develop a simple description of the truncation that leads to a good match with simulated SZ profiles out to several $R\_{200c}$ for clusters of varying mass and concentration, and that also accurately predicts the concentration-$Y$ relationship. Finally, we determine how inference of the linear bias parameter and splashback radius for SZ-selected clusters can be biased by ignoring the concentration dependence of the SZ signal.

2023-04-18, **Graceful exit from inflation and reheating with twin waterfalls**, Hyun Min Lee et.al., [2304.08686v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08686v1)

 We study the hybrid inflation with a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson inflaton and two waterfall scalar fields. The $Z\_2$ symmetry for the waterfall fields keeps inflaton potential flat against quantum corrections coming from the waterfall couplings, and it is broken spontaneously in the vacuum without a domain wall problem within the Hubble horizon of our universe. We show that the $Z\_2$ invariant Higgs portal couplings to the waterfall fields are responsible for the reheating process, leading to a sufficiently large reheating temperature after inflation. In the presence of an extra $Z'\_2$ symmetry, one of the waterfall fields or another singlet scalar field becomes a dark matter candidate. In particular, we find that preheating is sufficient to account for the correct relic density of the waterfall dark matter.

2023-04-17, **Early Science with the Oscura Integration Test**, Santiago Perez et.al., [2304.08625v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08625v1)

 Oscura is a planned light-dark matter search experiment using Skipper-CCDs with a total active mass of 10 kg. As part of the detector development, the collaboration plans to build the Oscura Integration Test (OIT), an engineering test experiment with 10% of the Oscura's total mass. Here we discuss the early science opportunities with the OIT to search for millicharged particles (mCPs) using the NuMI beam at Fermilab. mCPs would be produced at low energies through photon-mediated processes from decays of scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector mesons, or direct Drell-Yan productions. Estimates show that the OIT would be a world-leading probe for low-mass mCPs.

2023-04-17, **Catching Tidal Dwarf Galaxies at a Later Evolutionary Stage with ALFALFA**, Laurin M. Gray et.al., [2304.08552v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08552v1)

 We present deep optical imaging and photometry of four objects classified as "Almost-Dark" galaxies in the ALFALFA survey because of their gas-rich nature and extremely faint or missing optical emission in existing catalogs. They have HI masses of $10^7$-$10^9$ $M\_{\odot}$ and distances of $\sim$9-100 Mpc. Observations with the WIYN 3.5m telescope and One Degree Imager reveal faint stellar components with central surface brightnesses of $\sim$24-25 $\mathrm{mag}\,\mathrm{arcsec}^{-2}$ in the g-band. We also present the results of HI synthesis observations with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. These Almost-Dark galaxies have been identified as possible tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) based on their proximity to one or more massive galaxies. We demonstrate that AGC 229398 and AGC 333576 likely have the low dark matter content and large effective radii representative of TDGs. They are located much farther from their progenitors than previously studied TDGs, suggesting they are older and more evolved. AGC 219369 is likely dark matter dominated, while AGC 123216 has a dark matter content that is unusually high for a TDG, but low for a normal dwarf galaxy. We consider possible mechanisms for the formation of the TDG candidates such as a traditional major merger scenario and gas ejection from a high velocity fly-by. Blind HI surveys like ALFALFA enable the detection of gas-rich, optically faint TDGs that can be overlooked in other surveys, thereby providing a more complete census of the low-mass galaxy population and an opportunity to study TDGs at a more advanced stage of their life cycle.

2023-04-17, **Current and Future constraints on Very-Light Axion-Like Particles from X-ray observations of cluster-hosted Active Galaxies**, Julia M. Sisk-Reynes et.al., [2304.08513v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08513v1)

 We discuss our recent constraints on the coupling of Very-Light Axion-Like Particles (of masses $<$$ 10^{-12} \ \mathrm{eV}$) to electromagnetism from $Chandra$ observations of the cluster-hosted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) H1821+643 and NGC1275. In both cases, the inferred high-quality AGN spectra excluded all photon-ALP couplings $g\_\mathrm{a\gamma} > (6.3 - 8.0) \times 10^{-13} \ {\mathrm{GeV}}^{-1}$ at the $99.7\%$ level, respectively, based on the non-detection of spectral distortions attributed to photon-ALP inter-conversion along the cluster line-of-sight. Finally, we present the prospects of tightening current bounds on such ALPs by up to a factor of 10 with next-generation X-ray observatories such as $Athena$, $AXIS$ and $LEM$ given their improved spectral and spatial resolution and collecting area compared to current missions.

2023-04-17, **Effective electric field: quantifying the sensitivity of searches for new P,T-odd physics with EuCl$_3\cdot$6H$_2$O**, Alexander O. Sushkov et.al., [2304.08461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08461v1)

 Laboratory-scale precision experiments are a promising approach to searching for physics beyond the standard model. Non-centrosymmetric solids offer favorable statistical sensitivity for efforts that search for new fields, whose interactions violate the discrete parity and time-reversal symmetries. One example is the electric Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment (CASPEr-e), which is sensitive to the defining interaction of the QCD axion dark matter with gluons in atomic nuclei. The effective electric field is the parameter that quantifies the sensitivity of such experiments to new physics. We describe the theoretical approach to calculating the effective electric field for non-centrosymmetric sites in ionic insulating solids. We consider the specific example of the EuCl$\_3\cdot$6H$\_2$O crystal, which is a particularly promising material. The optimistic estimate of the effective electric field for the $^{153}$Eu isotope in this crystal is 10 MV/cm. The calculation uncertainty is estimated to be two orders of magnitude, dominated by the evaluation of the Europium nuclear Schiff moment.

2023-04-17, **A first application of machine and deep learning for background rejection in the ALPS II TES detector**, Manuel Meyer et.al., [2304.08406v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08406v1)

 Axions and axion-like particles are hypothetical particles predicted in extensions of the standard model and are promising cold dark matter candidates. The Any Light Particle Search (ALPS II) experiment is a light-shining-through-the-wall experiment that aims to produce these particles from a strong light source and magnetic field and subsequently detect them through a reconversion into photons. With an expected rate $\sim$ 1 photon per day, a sensitive detection scheme needs to be employed and characterized. One foreseen detector is based on a transition edge sensor (TES). Here, we investigate machine and deep learning algorithms for the rejection of background events recorded with the TES. We also present a first application of convolutional neural networks to classify time series data measured with the TES.

2023-04-17, **Search for gravitational-lensing signatures in the full third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo network**, The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et.al., [2304.08393v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08393v1)

 Gravitational lensing by massive objects along the line of sight to the source causes distortions of gravitational wave-signals; such distortions may reveal information about fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics. In this work, we have extended the search for lensing signatures to all binary black hole events from the third observing run of the LIGO--Virgo network. We search for repeated signals from strong lensing by 1) performing targeted searches for subthreshold signals, 2) calculating the degree of overlap amongst the intrinsic parameters and sky location of pairs of signals, 3) comparing the similarities of the spectrograms amongst pairs of signals, and 4) performing dual-signal Bayesian analysis that takes into account selection effects and astrophysical knowledge. We also search for distortions to the gravitational waveform caused by 1) frequency-independent phase shifts in strongly lensed images, and 2) frequency-dependent modulation of the amplitude and phase due to point masses. None of these searches yields significant evidence for lensing. Finally, we use the non-detection of gravitational-wave lensing to constrain the lensing rate based on the latest merger-rate estimates and the fraction of dark matter composed of compact objects.

2023-04-17, **Exotic Image Formation in Strong Gravitational Lensing by Clusters of Galaxies -- IV. Elliptical NFW Lenses and Hyperbolic Umbilics**, Ashish Kumar Meena et.al., [2304.08326v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08326v1)

 A source lying near hyperbolic umbilic (HU) leads to a ring-like image formation, constituting four images with high magnification factors and lying in a small region of the lens plane. Since (based on our earlier work) the observed number of HU image formations in cluster lenses is expected to increase in future, it is timely to investigate them in more detail. Like fold and cusp, HU also satisfies the magnification relation, i.e., the signed magnification sum of the four images equals zero. This work presents a detailed study of HU magnification relation ($R\_{\rm hu}$) considering the elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White (eNFW) lens profile suitable for cluster scale dark matter halos. Our results show that for an isolated eNFW lens, $R\_{\rm hu}$ is more sensitive to ellipticity than its mass or concentration parameter. An ellipticity greater than 0.3 results in $R\_{\rm hu}$ lying close to zero with a small scatter around it. A substructure near the HU image formation causes the average $R\_{\rm hu}$ value to deviate from zero and increases the scatter, with the amount of deviation depending on the image type near which the substructure lies. However, a population of substructures in the lens plane (equivalent to the galaxy lenses inside the cluster) does not significantly shift the average $R\_{\rm hu}$ value from zero but increases the scatter around it. We find that $R\_{\rm hu} \simeq 0$ for HU image formation in the Abell 1703 cluster. Repeating this test in other clusters where HU formations are discovered can be a useful indicator of substructure in cluster halos.

2023-04-17, **Outflows in the Gaseous Discs of Active Galaxies and their impact on Black Hole Scaling Relations**, N. Menci et.al., [2304.08273v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08273v1)

 To tackle the still unsolved and fundamental problem of the role of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback in shaping galaxies, in this work we implement a new physical treatment of AGN-driven winds into our semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. To each galaxy in our model, we associate solutions for the outflow expansion and the mass outflow rates in different directions, depending on the AGN luminosity, on the circular velocity of the host halo, and on gas content of the considered galaxy. To each galaxy we also assign an effective radius derived from energy conservation during merger events, and a stellar velocity dispersion self-consistently computed via Jeans modelling. We derive all the main scaling relations between Black hole (BH) mass and total/bulge stellar mass, velocity dispersion, host halo dark matter mass, and star formation efficiency. We find that our improved AGN feedback mostly controls the dispersion around the relations but plays a subdominant role in shaping slopes and/or normalizations of the scaling relations. Including possible limited-resolution selection biases in the model provides better agreement with the available data. The model does not point to any more fundamental galactic property linked to BH mass, with velocity dispersion playing a similar role with respect to stellar mass, in tension with present data. In line with other independent studies carried out on comprehensive semi-analytic and hydrodynamic galaxy-BH evolution models, our current results signal either an inadequacy of present cosmological models of galaxy formation in fully reproducing the local scaling relations, in terms of both shape and residuals, and/or point to an incompleteness issue affecting the local sample of dynamically-measured BHs.

2023-04-17, **Prospects for annihilating dark matter from M31 and M33 observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array**, Miltiadis Michailidis et.al., [2304.08202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08202v1)

 M31 and M33 are the closest spiral galaxies and the largest members (together with the Milky Way) of the Local group, which makes them interesting targets for indirect dark matter searches. In this paper we present studies of the expected sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) to an annihilation signal from weakly interacting massive particles from M31 and M33. We show that a 100 h long observation campaign will allow CTA to probe annihilation cross-sections up to $\langle\sigma\upsilon\rangle\approx 5\cdot10^{-25}~\mathrm{cm^{3}s^{-1}}$ for the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ annihilation channel (for M31, at a DM mass of 0.3 TeV), improving the current limits derived by HAWC by up to an order of magnitude. We present an estimate of the expected CTA sensitivity, by also taking into account the contributions of the astrophysical background and other possible sources of systematic uncertainty. We also show that CTA might be able to detect the extended emission from the bulge of M31, detected at lower energies by the Fermi/LAT.

2023-04-17, **The Universe is worth $64^3$ pixels: Convolution Neural Network and Vision Transformers for Cosmology**, Se Yeon Hwang et.al., [2304.08192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08192v1)

 We present a novel approach for estimating cosmological parameters, $\Omega\_m$, $\sigma\_8$, $w\_0$, and one derived parameter, $S\_8$, from 3D lightcone data of dark matter halos in redshift space covering a sky area of $40^\circ \times 40^\circ$ and redshift range of $0.3 < z < 0.8$, binned to $64^3$ voxels. Using two deep learning algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT), we compare their performance with the standard two-point correlation (2pcf) function. Our results indicate that CNN yields the best performance, while ViT also demonstrates significant potential in predicting cosmological parameters. By combining the outcomes of Vision Transformer, Convolution Neural Network, and 2pcf, we achieved a substantial reduction in error compared to the 2pcf alone. To better understand the inner workings of the machine learning algorithms, we employed the Grad-CAM method to investigate the sources of essential information in activation maps of the CNN and ViT. Our findings suggest that the algorithms focus on different parts of the density field and redshift depending on which parameter they are predicting. This proof-of-concept work paves the way for incorporating deep learning methods to estimate cosmological parameters from large-scale structures, potentially leading to tighter constraints and improved understanding of the Universe.

 PSR J1933$-$6211 is a 3.5-ms pulsar in a 12.8-d orbit with a white dwarf (WD). Its high proper motion and low dispersion measure result in such significant interstellar scintillation that high signal-to-noise detections require long observing durations or fortuitous timing. We turn to the sensitive MeerKAT telescope and, combined with historic Parkes data, leverage PSR J1933$-$6211's kinematic and relativistic effects to constrain its 3D orbital geometry and the component masses. We obtain precise proper motion and parallax estimates, and measure their effects as secular changes in the Keplerian orbital parameters: a variation in orbital period of $7(1) \times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$ and a change in projected semi-major axis of $1.60(5) \times 10^{-14}$ s s$^{-1}$. A self-consistent analysis of all kinematic and relativistic effects yields a distance of $1.6^{+0.2}\_{-0.3}$ kpc, an orbital inclination, $i = 55(1)$ deg and a longitude of the ascending node, $\Omega = 255^{+8}\_{-14}$ deg. The probability densities for $\Omega$ and $i$ and their symmetric counterparts, ($180-i$, $360-\Omega$), are seen to depend on the fiducial orbit used to measure the time of periastron passage. We investigate this unexpected dependence and rule out software-related causes using simulations. Nevertheless, we constrain the pulsar and WD masses to $1.4^{+0.3}\_{-0.2}$ M$\_\odot$ and $0.43(5)$ M$\_\odot$ respectively. These strongly disfavour a helium-dominated WD. The orbital similarities between PSRs J1933$-$6211 and J1614$-$2230 suggest they underwent Case A Roche lobe overflow, an extended evolution while the companion star is still on the Main Sequence. However, with a mass of $\sim 1.4$ M$\_\odot$, PSR J1933$-$6211 has not accreted significant matter. This highlights the low accretion efficiency of the spin-up process and suggests that observed neutron star masses are mostly a result of supernova physics.

 We present a detailed multi-wavelength study of star formation in the dwarf galaxy NGC 4395 which hosts an active galactic nucleus (AGN). From our observations with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope, we have compiled a catalogue of 284 star forming (SF) regions, out of which we could detect 120 SF regions in H$\alpha$ observations. Across the entire galaxy, we found the extinction corrected star formation rate (SFR) in the far ultra-violet (FUV) to range from 2.0 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ M$\_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ to 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ M$\_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ with a median of 3.0 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ M$\_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and age to lie in the range of $\sim$ 1 to 98 Myr with a median of 14 Myr. In H$\alpha$ we found the SFR to range from 7.2 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ M$\_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ to 2.7 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ M$\_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ with a median of 1.7 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ M$\_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and age to lie between 3 to 6 Myr with a median of 5 Myr. The stellar ages derived from H$\alpha$ show a gradual decline with galactocentric distance. We found three SF regions close to the center of NGC~4395 with high SFR both from H$\alpha$ and UV which could be attributed to feedback effects from the AGN. We also found six other SF regions in one of the spiral arms having higher SFR. These are very close to supernovae remnants which could have enhanced the SFR locally. We obtained a specific SFR (SFR per unit mass) for the whole galaxy 4.64 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$.

 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. They are excellent cosmological distance indicators due to the remarkable homogeneity of their light curves. However, the nature of the progenitors of SNe Ia is still not well understood. In the single-degenerate model, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) could grow its mass by accreting material from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, leading to the formation of SNe Ia when the mass of the WD approaches to the Chandrasekhar-mass limit, known as the AGB donor channel. In this channel, previous studies mainly concentrate on the wind-accretion pathway for the mass-increase of the WDs. In the present work, we employed an integrated mass-transfer prescription for the semidetached WD+AGB systems, and evolved a number of WD+AGB systems for the formation of SNe Ia through the Roche-lobe overflow process or the wind-accretion process. We provided the initial and final parameter spaces of WD+AGB systems for producing SNe Ia. We also obtained the density distribution of circumstellar matter at the moment when the WD mass reaches the Chandrasekhar-mass limit. Moreover, we found that the massive WD+AGB sample AT 2019qyl can be covered by the final parameter space for producing SNe Ia, indicating that AT 2019qyl is a strong progenitor candidate of SNe Ia with AGB donors.

2023-04-18, **The evolutionary route to form planetary nebulae with central neutron star - white dwarf binaries**, Iminhaji Ablimit et.al., [2304.08827v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08827v1)

 We present a possible evolutionary pathway to form planetary nebulae (PNe) with close neutron star (NS)-white dwarf (WD) binary central stars. By employing a comprehensive binary population synthesis technique we find that the evolution involves two common envelope evolution (CEE) phases and a core collapse supernova explosion between them that forms the NS. Later the lower mass star engulfs the NS as it becomes a red giant, a process that leads to the second CEE phase and to the ejection of the envelope. This leaves a hot horizontal branch star that evolves to become a helium WD and an expanding nebula. Both the WD and the NS power the nebula. The NS in addition might power a pulsar wind nebula inside the expanding PN. From our simulations we find that the Galactic formation rate of NS-WD PNe is $1.8 \times 10^{-5} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ while the Galactic formation rate of all PNe is $0.42 {\rm yr}^{-1}$. There is a possibility that one of the observed Galactic PNe might be a NS-WD PN, and a few NS-WD PNe might exist in the Galaxy. The central binary systems might be sources for future gravitational wave detectors like LISA, and possibly of electromagnetic telescopes.

 We study the properties of hot and dense neutron star matter under the presence of strong magnetic fields using two Skyrme interactions, namely the LNS and the BSk21 ones. Asking for $\beta$--stability and charge neutrality, we construct the equation of state of the system and analyze its composition for a range of densities, temperatures and magnetic field intensities of interest for the study of supernova and proto-neutron star matter, with a particular interest on the degree of spin-polarization of the different components. The results show that system configurations with larger fractions of spin up protons and spin down neutrons and electrons are energetically favored over those with larger fractions of spin down protons and spin up neutrons and electrons. The effective mass of neutrons and protons is found to be in general larger for the more abundant of their spin projection component, respectively, spin down neutrons and spin up protons. The effect of the magnetic field on the Helmhotz total free energy density, pressure and isothermal compressibility of the system is almost negligible for all the values of the magnetic field considered.

2023-04-17, **The Physics of Indirect Estimators of Lyman Continuum Escape and their Application to High-Redshift JWST Galaxies**, Nicholas Choustikov et.al., [2304.08526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08526v1)

 Reliable indirect diagnostics of LyC photon escape from galaxies are required to understand which sources were the dominant contributors to reionization. While multiple escape fraction ($f\_{\rm esc}$) indicators have been proposed to trace favourable conditions for LyC leakage from the interstellar medium of low-redshift ``analog'' galaxies, it remains unclear whether these are applicable at high redshifts where LyC emission cannot be directly observed. Using a library of 14,120 mock spectra of star-forming galaxies with redshifts $4.64 \leq z \leq 10$ from the SPHINX$^{20}$ cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation, we develop a framework for the physics that leads to high $f\_{\rm esc}$. We investigate LyC leakage from our galaxies based on the criteria that successful LyC escape diagnostics must \textit{i)} track a high specific star formation rate, \textit{ii)} be sensitive to stellar population age in the range $3.5-10$~Myr representing the times when supernova first explode to when LyC production significantly drops, and \textit{iii)} include a proxy for neutral gas content and gas density in the interstellar medium. ${\rm O}\_{32}$, $\Sigma\_{\rm SFR}$, M$\_{\rm UV}$, and H$\beta$ equivalent width select for one or fewer of our criteria, rendering them either necessary but insufficient or generally poor diagnostics. In contrast, UV slope ($\beta$), and ${\rm E(B-V)}$ match two or more of our criteria, rendering them good $f\_{\rm esc}$ diagnostics (albeit with significant scatter). Using our library, we build a quantitative model for predicting $f\_{\rm esc}$ based on $\beta$, ${\rm E(B-V)}$, H$\beta$, M$\_{\rm UV}$, ${\rm R\_{23}}$, and ${\rm O\_{32}}$. When applied to bright $z > 6$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters observed with JWST, we find that the majority of them have $f\_{\rm esc} \lesssim 10\%$.

2023-04-17, **Detached and Continuous Circumstellar Matter in Type Ibc Supernovae from Mass Eruption**, Daichi Tsuna et.al., [2304.08378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08378v1)

 Some hydrogen-poor supernovae (SNe) are found to undergo interaction with dense circumstellar matter (CSM) that may originate from mass eruption(s) just prior to core-collapse. We model the interaction between the remaining star and the bound part of the erupted CSM that eventually fall back to the star. We find that while fallback initially results in a continuous CSM down to the star, feedback processes from the star can push the CSM to large radii of $\gtrsim 10^{15}$ cm from several years after the eruption. In the latter case, a tenuous bubble surrounded by a dense and detached CSM extending to $\gtrsim 10^{16}$ cm is expected. Our model offers a natural unifying explanation for the diverse CSM structures seen in hydrogen-poor SNe, such as Type Ibn/Icn SNe that show CSM signatures soon after explosion, and the recently discovered Type Ic SNe 2021ocs and 2022xxf ("the Bactrian") with CSM signatures seen only at late times.
