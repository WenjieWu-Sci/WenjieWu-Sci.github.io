2023-04-27, **Lepton flavor physics at $μ^+ μ^+$ colliders**, Kåre Fridell et.al., [2304.14020v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14020v1)

 We discuss sensitivities to lepton flavor violating (and conserving) interactions at future muon colliders, especially at $\mu^+\mu^+$ colliders. Compared with the searches for rare decays of $\mu$ and $\tau$, we find that the TeV-scale future colliders have better sensitivities depending on the pattern of hierarchy in the flavor mixings. As an example, we study the case with the type-II seesaw model, where the flavor mixing parameters have direct relation to the neutrino mass matrix. At a $\mu^+ \mu^+$ collider, the number of events of the $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to \mu^+ \tau^+$ process can be larger than $\mathcal{O}(100)$ with the center of mass energy $\sqrt s = 2$ TeV, and with an integrated luminosity ${\cal L} = 1$ ab$^{-1}$, while satisfying bounds from rare decays of $\mu$ and $\tau$. We discuss impacts of the overall mass scale of neutrinos as well as CP violating phases to the number of expected events.

2023-04-27, **Quantifying and mitigating the effect of snapshot interval in light-cone Epoch of Reionization 21-cm simulations**, Suman Pramanick et.al., [2304.14171v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14171v1)

 The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N\_{\rm RS})$ of ''reionization snapshot'', each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N\_{\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(> 200 \%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N\_{\rm RS}$ is small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $\delta \bar{x}\_{\rm HI} = 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \%$ for $N\_{\rm RS} = 13$ where $\delta \bar{x}\_{\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N\_{\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the dark matter and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N\_{\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N\_{\rm RS}^{-1}$.

2023-04-27, **Detecting Fundamental Vector Fields with LISA**, Shaun David Brocus Fell et.al., [2304.14129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14129v1)

 The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has seen a huge influx of new predictions for potential discoveries of beyond the Standard Model fields. The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive dark photon, a promising dark matter candidate. The dark photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive dark matter particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the dark photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the dark photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \times 10^{-16}]$ eV.

2023-04-27, **The resonant probing spin-0 and spin-2 dark matter mediators with fixed target experiments**, I. V. Voronchikhin et.al., [2304.14052v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14052v1)

 We discuss the mechanism to produce electron-specific dark matter mediators of spin-0 and spin-2 in the electron fixed target experiments such as NA64 and LDMX. The positrons produced by the electromagnetic shower can produce the regarding mediators via annihilation on atomic electrons. That mechanism, for some selected kinematics, results in the enhanced sensitivity with respect to the bounds derived by the bremsstrahlung-like emission of the mediator in the specific parameter space. We derive the regarding experimental reach of the NA64 and LDMX.

2023-04-27, **Massive Dark Matter Halos at High Redshift: Implications for Observations in the JWST Era**, Yangyao Chen et.al., [2304.13890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13890v1)

 Recent observations made by the JWST have revealed a number of massive galaxies at high redshift ($z$). The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $\rho\_*(>M\_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $\epsilon\_* \sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2\sigma$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \sim 7 - 10$ to the $2\sigma$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M\_{\rm halo} > 10^{13} h^{-1}M\_\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M\_{\rm halo} \geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M\_\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.

2023-04-27, **The observed number counts in luminosity distance space**, José Fonseca et.al., [2304.14253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14253v1)

 Next generation surveys will provide us with an unprecedented number of detections of supernovae Type Ia and gravitational wave merger events. Cross-correlations of such objects offer novel and powerful insights into the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe. Both of these sources carry information on their luminosity distance, but remain uninformative about their redshifts; hence their clustering analyses and cross-correlations need to be carried out in luminosity distance space, as opposed to redshift space. In this paper, we calculate the full expression for the number count fluctuation in terms of a perturbation to the observed luminosity distance. We find the expression to differ significantly from the one commonly used in redshift space. Furthermore, we present a comparison of the number count angular power spectra between luminosity distance and redshift spaces. We see a wide divergence between the two at large scales, and we note that lensing is the main contribution to such differences. On such scales and at higher redshifts the difference between the angular power spectra in luminosity distance and redshift spaces can be roughly 50$\%$. We also investigate cross-correlating different redshift bins using different tracers, i.e. one in luminosity distance space and one in redshift, simulating the cross-correlation angular power spectrum between background gravitational waves/supernovae and foreground galaxies. Finally, we show that in a cosmic variance limited survey, the relativistic corrections to the density-only term ought to be included.

2023-04-27, **Constraints on the Local Cosmic Void from the Pantheon Supernovae Data**, Ke Wang et.al., [2304.13945v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13945v1)

 In principle, the local cosmic void can be simply modeled by the spherically symmetric Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric. In practice, the real local cosmic void is probably not spherically symmetric. In this paper, to reconstruct the realistic profile of the local cosmic void, we divide it into several segments. Each segment with certain solid angle is modeled by its own LTB metric. Meanwhile, we divide the 1048 type Ia supernovae (SNIa) of Pantheon into corresponding subsets according to their distribution in the galactic coordinate system. Obviously, each SNIa subset can only be used to reconstruct the profile of one segment. Finally, we can patch together an irregular profile for the local cosmic void with the whole Pantheon sample. But our constraints are too weak to challenge the cosmic homogeneity and the cosmic isotropy.
