2023-12-11, **Fast Conversion of Neutrinos: Energy Dependence of Flavor Instabilities**, Pedro Dedin Neto et.al., [2312.06556v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06556v1)

 In core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, the neutrino density is so large that neutrino-neutrino refraction can lead to flavor conversion, classified as ``fast'' since the neutrino self-interaction strength $\mu=\sqrt{2} G\_F n\_\nu$ represents the characteristic time-scale of the system. However, it has been empirically realized that the vacuum frequency $\omega=\Delta m^2/2E$ affects the development of flavor conversion even if $\omega \ll \mu$, as is the case in the core of compact astrophysical sources. Focusing on a homogeneous and axially symmetric neutrino gas, we explore the role of $\omega$ in the onset of flavor instabilities. Relying on a perturbative approach, we find that the odd powers of $\omega$ are linked to the angular distribution of the neutrino flavor particle number (FPN). Hence, when $\omega \neq 0$, the flavor conversion dynamics does not depend on the neutrino flavor lepton number only (FLN), like for fast flavor conversion, but also on the FPN. A non-zero vacuum frequency is also responsible for inducing flavor instabilities with a non-negligible growth rate in a neutrino gas that would be otherwise stable for $\omega \rightarrow 0$. Such a neutrino ensemble with $\omega \neq 0$ can be formally mapped into an effective system with $\omega =0$, whose angular distributions have non-zero imaginary components. Our work highlights the overlooked role of vacuum mixing in the development of flavor instabilities in neutrino systems with FLN zero-crossings in the angular distributions.

2023-12-11, **The Anatomy of $K^+\toπ^+ν\barν$ Distributions**, Martin Gorbahn et.al., [2312.06494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06494v1)

 The excellent experimental prospects to measure the invisible mass spectrum of the $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ decay opens a new path to test generalised quark--neutrino interactions with flavour changing $s\to d$ transitions and as such to novel probes of Physics beyond the Standard Model. Such signals can be a consequence of new lepton-number violating or lepton-number conserving interactions, with their interpretations depending on the Majorana versus Dirac nature of the neutrinos. Furthermore, the possible existence of new massive sterile neutrinos can be tested via their distinctive imprints in the invariant mass spectrum. Within the model-independent framework of the weak effective theory at dimension-six, we study the New Physics effects of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos on the differential distribution of $K^+\rightarrow \pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ allowing for lepton-number violating interactions and potential new sterile neutrinos. We determine the current and expected future sensitivity on the corresponding Wilson coefficients using the distribution measured by the NA62 collaboration and accounting for expected improvements based on the HIKE experiment. We present single-operator fits and also determine correlations among different type of operators. Even though we focus on $s\to d\nu\nu$ transitions, the operator bases for Majorana and Dirac and the classification of lepton-number-violating/conserving interactions is applicable also for the study of $b\to s/d\nu\nu$ and $c\to u\nu\nu$ transitions relevant in current phenomenology.

2023-12-11, **Leptogenesis with a Coupling Knob**, Peisi Huang et.al., [2312.06380v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06380v1)

 We propose a novel leptogenesis mechanism wherein the coupling between the right-handed neutrino and Standard Model particles is temperature-dependent. In this mechanism, the coupling experiences suppression at high temperatures and becomes sizable when the washout processes are Boltzmann-suppressed. This temperature-dependent coupling ensures that the washout rates consistently remain lower than the Hubble expansion rate, allowing all generated lepton asymmetry to survive. We illustrate this mechanism through two toy model examples and demonstrate that the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be successfully obtained for right-handed neutrino masses larger than $10^9~{\rm GeV}$ as well as for smaller CP-violation values.

2023-12-11, **The future muon collider for the research of the anomalous neutral quartic $Zγγγ$, $ZZγγ$, and $ZZZγ$ couplings**, V. Cetinkaya et.al., [2312.06329v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06329v1)

 In the post-LHC era, the muon collider represents a frontier project capable of providing high-energy and high-luminosity leptonic collisions among future lepton-lepton particle accelerators. In addition, it provides significantly cleaner final states than those produced in hadron collisions. With this expectation in mind, in this article, we research the sensitivity of the anomalous neutral gauge boson couplings $Z\gamma\gamma\gamma$, $ZZ\gamma \gamma$, and $ZZZ\gamma$ defined by dimension-8 operators, through the $\mu^+\mu^- \to \mu^+\mu^-Z\gamma$ signal, with the $Z$-boson decaying to neutrino pair. The projections of new physics at the future muon collider with the center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=10$ TeV, integrated luminosity of ${\cal L}=10$ $\rm ab^{-1}$, and systematic uncertainties of $\delta\_{sys}=0\%, 3\%, 5\%$, for extraction of expected sensitivity on the anomalous $f\_ {T,j}/\Lambda^4$ couplings at $95\%$ confidence level, are of the order of ${\cal O}(10^{-4}- 10^{-3})$. Compared with the research of the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations on the anomalous quartic gauge couplings, we find that the high-luminosity future muon collider could have better sensitivity.

2023-12-11, **The Sensitivity Floor for Primordial Black Holes with Neutrino Searches**, Qishan Liu et.al., [2312.06108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06108v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe are well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates over a wide range of masses. These PBHs could emit detectable signals in the form of photons, electrons, and neutrinos through Hawking radiation. We consider the null observations of astrophysical $\bar{\nu}\_{e}$ flux from several neutrino detectors and set new constraints on the PBHs as the dominant DM component to be above $6.4\times10^{15}\,{\rm g}$. We also estimate the expected constraints with JUNO for the prospects in the near future. Lastly, we note that the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) is an unavoidable isotropic background. We thus estimate the sensitivity floor for PBH parameter space due to DSNB, and show that it is difficult for neutrino detectors to detect PBHs as 100% of DM above $9 \times 10^{15}\,{\rm g}$.

 The general theory of relativity (GR) has excelled in explaining gravitational phenomena at the scale of the solar system with remarkable precision. However, when extended to the galactic or cosmological scale, it requires dark matter and dark energy to explain observations. In our previous article arXiv:2308.04503, we've formulated a gravity theory based in Mach's principle, known as Machian gravity. We demonstrated that the theory successfully explains galactic velocity profiles without requiring additional dark matter components. In previous studies, for a selected set of galaxy clusters, we also showed its ability to explain the velocity dispersion in the clusters without extra unseen matter components. This paper primarily explores the mass profiles of galaxy clusters. We test the Machian Gravity acceleration law on two distinct sets comprising approximately 150 galaxy clusters sourced from various studies. We fitted the dynamic mass profiles using the Machian gravity model. The outcomes of our study show exceptional agreement between the theory and observational results.

2023-12-11, **Measuring the reionization optical depth without large-scale CMB polarization**, William Giarè et.al., [2312.06482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06482v1)

 We study the possibility of measuring the optical depth at reionization, $\tau$, without relying on large-scale Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization. Our analysis is driven by the need to obtain competitive measurements that can validate the state-of-the-art constraints on this parameter, widely based on E-mode polarization measurements at $\ell\le 30$. This need is partially motivated by the typical concerns regarding anomalies observed in the Planck large-scale CMB data as well as by the remarkable fact that, excluding these latter, $\tau$ consistently exhibits correlations with anomalous parameters, such as $A\_{\rm lens}$ and $\Omega\_k$, suggesting that slightly higher values of the optical depth at reionization could significantly alleviate or even eliminate anomalies. Within the $\Lambda$CDM model, our most constraining result is $\tau = 0.080 \pm 0.012$, obtained by combining Planck temperature and polarization data at $\ell > 30$, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck measurements of the lensing potential, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Type-Ia supernova data from the Pantheon+ catalogue. Notably, using only ACT temperature, polarization, and lensing data in combination with BAO and supernovae, we obtain $\tau = 0.076 \pm 0.015$, which is entirely independent of Planck. The relative precision of these results is approaching the constraints based on large-scale CMB polarization ($\tau = 0.054 \pm 0.008$). Despite the overall agreement, we report a slight $1.8\sigma$ shift towards larger values of $\tau$. We also test how these results change by extending the cosmological model. While in many extensions they remain robust, in general obtaining precise measurements of $\tau$ may become significantly more challenging.

2023-12-11, **Revisiting kink-like parametrization and constraints using OHD/Pantheon/BAO samples**, Simran Arora et.al., [2312.06464v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06464v1)

 We reexamine the kink-like parameterization of the deceleration parameter to derive constraints on the transition redshift from cosmic deceleration to acceleration. This is achieved using observational Hubble data, Type Ia supernovae Pantheon samples, and Baryon acoustic oscillations/cosmic microwave background. In this parametrization, the value of the initial $q$ parameter is $q\_{i}$, the final value is $q\_f$, the present value is denoted by $q\_{0}$, and the transition duration is given by $\alpha$. We perform our calculations using the Monte Carlo method, utilizing the emcee package. Under the assumption of a flat geometry, we constrain the range of possible values for three scenarios: when $q\_{f}$ is unrestricted, when $q\_{f}$ is equal to $-1$, and when $\alpha$ is equal to $1/3$. This is done assuming that $q\_{i}=1/2$. Here, we achieved that the OHD data fixes the free parameters as in the flat $\Lambda$CDM for unrestricted $q\_{f}$. In addition, if we fix $q\_{f}=-1$, the model behaves well as the $\Lambda$CDM for the combined dataset. The individual supernova data is causing tension in our determination when contrasted to the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also acquired the current value of the deceleration parameter, which is consistent with the latest results from the Planck Collaboration that assume the $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we observe a deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the current model based on the evolution of $j(z)$, and it is evident that the universe transitions from deceleration to acceleration and will eventually reach the $\Lambda$CDM model in the near future.
