2024-10-14, **Testing interacting dark energy with Stage IV cosmic shear surveys through differentiable neural emulators**, K. Carrion et.al., [2410.10603v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10603v1)

 We employ a novel framework for accelerated cosmological inference, based on neural emulators and gradient-based sampling methods, to forecast constraints on dark energy models from Stage IV cosmic shear surveys. We focus on dark scattering (DS), an interacting dark energy model with pure momentum exchange in the dark sector, and train COSMOPOWER emulators to accurately and efficiently model the DS non-linear matter power spectrum produced by the halo model reaction framework, including the effects of baryon feedback and massive neutrinos. We embed the emulators within a fully-differentiable pipeline for gradient-based cosmological inference for which the batch likelihood call is up to $O(10^5)$ times faster than with traditional approaches, producing parameter constraints from simulated Stage IV cosmic shear data running on a single graphics processing unit (GPU). We also perform model comparison on the output chains from the inference process, employing the learnt harmonic mean estimator implemented in the software HARMONIC. We investigate degeneracies between dark energy and systematics parameters and assess the impact of scale cuts on the final constraints. Assuming a DS model for the mock data vector, we find that a Stage IV survey cosmic shear analysis can constrain the DS amplitude parameter $A\_{\mathrm{ds}}$ with an uncertainty roughly an order of magnitude smaller than current constraints from Stage III surveys, even after marginalising over baryonic feedback, intrinsic alignments and redshift distribution uncertainties. These results show great promise for constraining DS with Stage IV data; furthermore, our methodology can be straightforwardly extended to a wide range of dark energy and modified gravity models.

2024-10-14, **Comment on "A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field"**, James M. Cline et.al., [2410.10522v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10522v1)

 It was recently suggested (arxiv:2410.06604) that the small value of the dark energy of the universe could be explained in terms of the scale of neutrino masses through a simple quantum field theoretic mechanism. I clarify that the quantity computed is only a threshold correction to the vacuum energy at the low $m\_\nu$ scale, and therefore cannot explain the magnitude of the vacuum energy.

2024-10-14, **Charged Lepton Flavour Violating Meson Decays in Seesaw Models**, Pravesh Chndra Awasthi et.al., [2410.10490v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10490v1)

 The occurrence of neutrino oscillations demands the existence of flavour violation in charged lepton sector. The relation between the branching ratios of different charged lepton flavour violating (CLFV) decay modes depends on the details of the neutrino mass model. In this work, we consider the three types of simple seesaw mechanisms of neutrino masses and study the correlation between the radiative CLFV decays and the meson CLFV decays. We find that the meson CLFV decay branching ratios are negligibly small in type-II seesaw mechanism whereas they are constrained to be at least three (two) orders of magnitude smaller than the radiative CLFV decay branching ratios in the case of type-I (type-III) seesaw mechanism. Thus the relationship between these two modes of CLFV decays helps in distinguishing between different types of seesaw mechanism. If, the branching ratios of CLFV decays of mesons are larger than those of radiative CLFV decays, it provides a strong hint that the neutrino mass generating mechanism is more complicated than simple seesaw.

2024-10-14, **Shining Light on the Dark Sector: Search for Axion-like Particles and Other New Physics in Photonic Final States with FASER**, FASER collaboration et.al., [2410.10363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10363v1)

 The first FASER search for a light, long-lived particle decaying into a pair of photons is reported. The search uses LHC proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}=13.6~\text{TeV}$ collected in 2022 and 2023, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $57.7\text{fb}^{-1}$. A model with axion-like particles (ALPs) dominantly coupled to weak gauge bosons is the primary target. Signal events are characterised by high-energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter and no signal in the veto scintillators. One event is observed, compared to a background expectation of $0.44 \pm 0.39$ events, which is entirely dominated by neutrino interactions. World-leading constraints on ALPs are obtained for masses up to $300~\text{MeV}$ and couplings to the Standard Model W gauge boson, $g\_{aWW}$, around $10^{-4}$ GeV$^{-1}$, testing a previously unexplored region of parameter space. Other new particle models that lead to the same experimental signature, including ALPs coupled to gluons or photons, U(1)$\_B$ gauge bosons, up-philic scalars, and a Type-I two-Higgs doublet model, are also considered for interpretation, and new constraints on previously viable parameter space are presented in this paper.

2024-10-14, **Measurement of the double-differential cross section of muon-neutrino charged-current interactions with low hadronic energy in the NOvA Near Detector**, M. A. Acero et.al., [2410.10222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10222v1)

 The NOvA collaboration reports cross-section measurements for $\nu\_{\mu}$ charged-current interactions with low hadronic energy (maximum kinetic energy of 250 MeV for protons and 175 MeV for pions) in the NOvA Near Detector. The results are presented as a double-differential cross section as a function of the direct observables of the final-state muon kinematics. Results are also presented as a single-differential cross section as a function of the derived square of the four-momentum transfer, $Q^{2}$, and as a function of the derived neutrino energy. The data correspond to an accumulated 8.09$\times10^{20}$ protons-on-target (POT) in the neutrino mode of the NuMI beam, with a narrow band of neutrino energies peaked at 1.8 GeV. The analysis provides a sample of neutrino-nucleus interactions with an enhanced fraction of quasi-elastic and two-particle-two-hole (2p2h) interactions. This enhancement allows quantitative comparisons with various nuclear models. We find strong disagreement between data and theory-based models in various regions of the muon kinematic phase space, especially in the forward muon direction.

2024-10-14, **Effective two-loop background contributions to $g_e-2$**, Jason L. Evans et.al., [2410.10715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10715v1)

 Recent work has shown the utility of examining background effects from ultralight dark matter on precision measurements. This effect enhances seemingly benign contributions to the level that experiments are sensitive to them. In this work, we examine the consequences of the effective axion-like particles coupling to photons in a background of axion-like particle dark matter. This analysis leads to new constraints on the product of the axion electron and axion photon coupling. Furthermore, since the axion photon coupling is generated, at one loop, by a pseudoscalar Yukawa coupling, this calculation can also be applied to constraining the axion-like particles coupling to the electron at the two-loop level. This contribution often dominates due to the fact that the one-loop contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron from a pseudoscalar is momentum suppressed.

2024-10-14, **Dark Energy**, Sergio Luigi Cacciatori et.al., [2410.10435v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10435v1)

 Among the great mysteries that physics has not yet solved are undoubtedly those of dark energy and dark matter. In this chapter we deal with the first of them. We will expound in detail the motivations that led to hypothesise the existence of dark energy, the importance of understanding its nature, its main possible theoretical explanations and a list of the many attempts at modelling it. We conclude with a description of the most recent and future missions on Earth and in space devised to shed light on this mystery.

2024-10-14, **Dark Matter**, Sergio Luigi Cacciatori et.al., [2410.10424v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10424v1)

 In this article we address the mystery of dark matter. We expound the various evidences, astrophysical and cosmological, leading to hypothesize the existence of an invisible form of matter, whose attempts at detecting it have so far all failed. We also discuss some alternative suggestions that replace the hypothesis of exotic matter with the assumption of modifications of the gravitational dynamics. For each of the various proposals we also discuss the strong and weak points.

2024-10-14, **A possible formation scenario of the Gaia BH1: inner binary merger in triple systems**, Zhuowen Li et.al., [2410.10581v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10581v1)

 Based on astrometric measurements and spectral analysis from $Gaia$ DR3, two quiescent black hole (BH) binaries, $Gaia$ BH1 and BH2, have been identified. Their origins remain controversial, particularly for $Gaia$ BH1. By considering a rapidly rotating ($\omega/\omega\_{\rm crit} = 0.8$) and strongly magnetized ($B\_{\rm 0} = 5000$ G) merger product, we find that, at typical Galactic metallicity, the merger product can undergo efficient chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). This results in the merger product having a significantly smaller radius during its evolution compared to that of a normally evolving massive star. Under the condition that the initial triple stability is satisfied, we use the Multiple Stellar Evolution (MSE) code and the MESA code to identify an initial hierarchical triple that can evolve into $Gaia$ BH1. It initially consists of three stars with masses of 9.03 $M\_{\odot}$, 3.12 $M\_{\odot}$, and 1 $M\_{\odot}$, with inner and outer orbital periods of 2.21 days and 121.92 days, and inner and outer eccentricities of 0.41 and 0.45, respectively. This triple initially experiences triple evolution dynamics instability (TEDI) followed by Roche lobe overflow (RLOF). During RLOF, the inner orbit shrinks, and tidal effects gradually suppress the TEDI. Eventually, the inner binary undergoes a merger through contact (or collision). Finally, using models of rapidly rotating and strongly magnetic stars, along with standard core-collapse supernova (SN) or failed supernova (FSN) models, we find that a PMB consisting of an 12.11 $M\_{\odot}$ merger product and a 1 $M\_{\odot}$ companion star (originally an outer tertiary) can avoid RLOF. After a SN or FSN with a low ejected mass of $\sim$0.22 $M\_{\odot}$ and a low kick velocity ($46^{+25}\_{-33}$ ${\rm km/s}$ or $9^{+16}\_{-8}$ ${\rm km/s}$), the PMB can form $Gaia$ BH1 in the Galactic disk.

2024-10-14, **Explaining Non-Merger Gamma-Ray Bursts and Broad-Lined Supernovae with Close Binary Progenitors with Black Hole Central Engine**, Christopher L. Fryer et.al., [2410.10378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10378v1)

 For over 25 years, the origin of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) has been linked to the collapse of rotating massive stars. However, we have yet to pinpoint the stellar progenitor powering these transients. Moreover, the dominant engine powering the explosions remains open to debate. Observations of both lGRBs, supernovae associated with these GRBs, such as broad-line (BL) stripped-envelope (type Ic) supernovae (hereafter, Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe) and perhaps superluminous SNe, fast blue optical transients, and fast x-ray transients, may provide clues to both engines and progenitors. In this paper, we conduct a detailed study of the tight-binary formation scenario for lGRBs, comparing this scenario to other leading progenitor models. Combining this progenitor scenario with different lGRB engines, we can compare to existing data and make predictions for future observational tests. We find that the combination of the tight-binary progenitor scenario with the black hole accretion disk (BHAD) engine can explain lGRBs, low-luminosity GRBs, ultra-long GRBs, and Ic-BL. We discuss the various progenitor properties required for these different subclasses and note such systems would be future gravitational wave merger sources. We show that the current literature on other progenitor-engine scenarios cannot explain all of these transient classes with a single origin, motivating additional work. We find that the tight-binary progenitor with a magnetar engine is excluded by existing observations. The observations can be used to constrain the properties of stellar evolution, the nature of the GRB and the associated SN engines in lGRBs and Ic-BL. We discuss the future observations needed to constrain our understanding of these rare, but powerful, explosions.
