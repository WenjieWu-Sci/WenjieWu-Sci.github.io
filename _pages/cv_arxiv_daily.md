2025-07-17, **Reassessing the gallium anomaly using exact electron wave functions**, M. Cadeddu et.al., [2507.13103v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13103v1)

 The gallium anomaly, a persistent discrepancy exceeding $4\sigma$ in the $^{71}$Ga neutrino capture rates from $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar calibration sources by the GALLEX, SAGE, and recently BEST experiments, has challenged particle physics and nuclear theory for over three decades. We present a new calculation for the neutrino capture cross-section, abandoning the conventional leading-order approximation for electronic wave functions by numerically solving the Dirac-Coulomb equation for both bound and continuum electron states. Finally, we re-evaluate the gallium anomaly, updating its global significance and presenting the most up-to-date status of its interpretation in terms of sterile neutrinos.

2025-07-16, **Invisible jets from composite neutrinos**, Matteo Borrello et.al., [2507.12527v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12527v1)

 We propose a novel experimental probe of neutrino couplings to a composite sterile sector, leveraging the unique signature of neutrino disintegration into "invisible jets" in high-energy neutrino scattering. Focusing on scenarios where the invisible jet invariant mass significantly exceeds the confinement scale, we compute production rates within the conformal window. In this regime, invisible jet production leads to an energy-dependent enhancement of the neutral-to-charged current ratio in neutrino-nucleus scattering. Using NuTeV measurements, we derive new bounds and assess the sensitivity of upcoming experiments such as SHiP and the Forward Physics Facility at CERN. We sketch models where these probes surpass constraints from electroweak gauge boson and Higgs invisible branching ratios. In contrast, neutrino-electron scattering modifications are suppressed by the lower center-of-mass energy and are unlikely to be observable at DUNE.

2025-07-16, **Cosmological neutrino mass: a frequentist overview in light of DESI**, D. Chebat et.al., [2507.12401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12401v1)

 We derive constraints on the neutrino mass using a variety of recent cosmological datasets, including DESI BAO, the full-shape analysis of the DESI matter power spectrum and the one-dimensional power spectrum of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (P1D) from eBOSS quasars as well as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The constraints are obtained in the frequentist formalism by constructing profile likelihoods and applying the Feldman-Cousins prescription to compute confidence intervals. This method avoids potential prior and volume effects that may arise in a comparable Bayesian analysis. Parabolic fits to the profiles allow one to distinguish changes in the upper limits from variations in the constraining power $\sigma$ of the different data combinations. We find that all profiles in the $\Lambda$CDM model are cut off by the $\sum m\_\nu \geq 0$ bound, meaning that the corresponding parabolas reach their minimum in the unphysical sector. The most stringent 95% C.L. upper limit is obtained by the combination of DESI DR2 BAO, Planck PR4 and CMB lensing at 53 meV, below the minimum of 59 meV set by the normal ordering. Extending $\Lambda$CDM to non-zero curvature and $w\_0w\_\mathrm{a}$CDM relaxes the constraints past 59 meV again, but only $w\_0w\_\mathrm{a}$CDM exhibits profiles with a minimum at a positive value. Using a combination of DESI DR1 full-shape, BBN and eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ P1D, we successfully constrain the neutrino mass independently of the CMB. This combination yields $\sum m\_\nu \leq 285$ meV (95% C.L.). The addition of DESI full-shape or Lyman-$\alpha$ P1D to CMB and DESI BAO results in small but noticeable improvement of the constraining power of the data. Lyman-$\alpha$ free-streaming measurements especially improve the constraint. Since they are based on eBOSS data, this sets a promising precedent for upcoming DESI data.

2025-07-16, **The impact of the transport of chemicals and electronic screening on helioseismic and neutrino observations in solar models**, Morgan Deal et.al., [2507.12335v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12335v1)

 The transport of chemical elements in stellar interiors is one of the greatest sources of uncertainties of solar and stellar modelling. The Sun, with its exquisite spectroscopic, helioseismic and neutrino observations, offers a prime environment to test the prescriptions used for both microscopic and macroscopic transport processes. We study in detail the impact of various formalisms for atomic diffusion on helioseismic constraints in both CLES (Scuflaire et al., 2008a) and Cesam2k2 (Morel and Lebreton 2008; Marques et al. 2013; Deal et al. 2018) models and compare both codes in detail. Moreover, due to the inability of standard models using microscopic diffusion to reproduce light element depletion in the Sun (Li, Be), another efficient process must be included to reproduce these constraints (rotation-induced: Eggenberger et al. 2022, overshooting -- or penetrative convection -- below the convective envelope: Th\'evenin et al. 2017, or ad hoc turbulence: Lebreton and Maeder 1987; Richer, Michaud, and Turcotte 2000). However, introducing such an extra mixing leads to issues with the CNO neutrino fluxes (see Buldgen et al. 2023), which seem to be systematically lower than the Borexino observations (Appel et al., 2022. Another key aspect to consider when reconciling models with neutrino fluxes is the impact of electronic screening (Mussack and D\"appen, 2011).

2025-07-16, **Search for Quantum Decoherence with 10.7 years of atmospheric $ν_μ$ events in IceCube**, Tanvi Krishnan et.al., [2507.12316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12316v1)

 In order to develop a consistent quantum theory of gravity, we must understand the nature of spacetime at the Planck scale. In particular if it exhibits quantum fluctuations, they may cause propagating particles to evolve in an apparently non-unitary manner. Neutrinos, which interact only via the weak force and gravity, maintain quantum coherence while propagating over large distances. Thus, neutrino oscillations serve as a precise interferometer to search for Planck-scale fluctuations of spacetime. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the world's largest neutrino telescope, located in the Antarctic icecap. We search the data on atmospheric neutrinos detected by IceCube in the energy range 0.5-100 TeV to test for neutrino decoherence. In this contribution, we present the sensitivity of the analysis, which shows significant improvement compared to previous IceCube results as a result of improved reconstruction and a larger sample of events.

2025-07-16, **Boosted dark matter versus dark matter-induced neutrinos from single and stacked blazars**, Andrea Giovanni De Marchi et.al., [2507.12278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12278v1)

 The physics responsible for the production of observed high-energy neutrinos have not been established so far, neither for the diffuse astrophysical ones nor for those detected from single blazars. We recently proposed that both could be explained by deep inelastic scatterings between sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around blazars and protons within their jets. Here, we compute the proton-recoil signals at the neutrino detectors Super-Kamiokande, KamLAND, Borexino, JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE induced by DM that is itself boosted by the scatterings with protons in blazar jets. We do it for the four cases of vector, axial, scalar and pseudoscalar mediators of DM-quark interactions. We perform the analysis for the single blazar TXS 0506+056 and for a sample of more than 300 stacked blazars. We find that searches for such blazar-boosted DM leave room for a variety of DM models to explain observations of high-energy neutrinos. We check that the depletion of the DM spike induced by DM-proton and DM-DM interactions does not compromise the DM interpretation for high-energy neutrinos, but challenges other blazar-DM signals.

2025-07-16, **No Hiding in the Dark: Cosmological Bounds on Heavy Neutral Leptons with Dark Decay Channels**, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., [2507.12270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12270v1)

 Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are well-motivated new physics candidates. The mixing of sub-GeV HNLs with active neutrinos is severely constrained by cosmology. In particular, the success of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) requires the HNL lifetime to be shorter than about 0.02 sec if they were in thermal equilibrium, thus excluding a wide range of mixing angles accessible to terrestrial experiments. In order to justify the laboratory searches in this cosmologically-forbidden region, it is often argued that adding new dark sector decay modes of HNLs can evade the stringent BBN constraint. Here we rule out this possibility and show that, contrary to the naive expectation, HNLs with significant dark decay modes actually lead to stronger cosmological bounds. This is mainly because of the increase in the extra radiation energy density in the Universe around the BBN epoch, which causes observable effects in the primordial helium fraction and $\Delta N\_{\rm eff}$. Our result has major implications for laboratory searches of HNLs.

2025-07-16, **Testing the influence of anisotropic CR transport and the Galactic magnetic field structure on the all-sky gamma-ray emission**, Julien Dörner et.al., [2507.12074v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12074v1)

 The spatial diffusion of energetic particles in a magnetic field composed of a large-scale background and a small-scale turbulent component should be expected to be anisotropic. While such anisotropic diffusion has been known for quite a while in first-principle plasma physics and while it is required for an understanding of the transport of cosmic rays in the heliosphere or close to supernova remnants, only in recent years it has also become of particular interest for the modeling of Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) transport in the Milky Way in the context of their residence time and their (local) energy spectra. Also, the large-scale spatial distribution of GCRs is shaped by an anisotropic diffusion in the Galactic magnetic field, which should directly affect both the diffuse gamma-ray and the neutrino emission.   We solve the anisotropic diffusive transport of GCRs in the Milky Way using the publicly available transport code CRPropa. The anisotropy of the diffusion is characterized by the ratio between the diffusion coefficient perpendicular and parallel to the local magnetic field $\epsilon = D\_\perp / D\_\parallel$, where we test different values reaching from nearly parallel transport ($\epsilon = 10^{-3}$) to more isotropic diffusion ($\epsilon = 10^{-1}$).   From the three dimensional distribution of GCRs in the Milky Way we calculate the all-sky gamma-ray emission, using the line-of-sight integration framework HERMES. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of the anisotropy in the diffusion on the spatial distribution of the gamma-ray flux and its spectral energy distribution. It shows strong influences by the anisotropy of the diffusion and the magnetic field geometry.

2025-07-16, **Scrutinizing the cosmogenic origin of the KM3-230213A event: A Multimessenger Perspective**, Alessandro Cermenati et.al., [2507.11993v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11993v1)

 The recent detection of the neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$~220 PeV) by the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope, the most energetic ever observed, could represent the long-awaited evidence for a cosmogenic origin, arising from the interaction of an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray with background photons. Its secure confirmation would mark a major advance in high-energy astrophysics. We perform a self-consistent multimessenger transport calculation of protons and their secondary $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos from cosmologically evolving sources, confronting predictions with data from the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube, KM3NeT, and the Fermi-LAT isotropic $\gamma$-ray background. A steep sub-ankle proton component saturates the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background and is disfavoured, whereas a hard proton spectrum extending beyond $10^{20}$~eV with evolution $\propto (1+z)^3$ reproduces KM3-230213A without violating any limits. This scenario requires a proton fraction $\lesssim 10$\% at $3\times 10^{19}$~eV and excludes faster-evolving sources. Joint UHE-neutrino and $\gamma$-ray observations thus sharpen constraints on extragalactic cosmic-ray sources and set targets for AugerPrime and next-generation neutrino telescopes.

2025-07-16, **A radiative lepton model in a non-invertible fusion rule**, Jingqian Chen et.al., [2507.11951v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11951v1)

 We propose a new mechanism in which electron and muon masses are induced at one-loop level after dynamically violating the symmetry of the Ising fusion rule. In the neutrino sector, while the neutrino mass is generated at one-loop level, the Ising fusion rule plays a role in stabilizing the particles inside the loop. As a result, the symmetry works like a $Z\_2$ symmetry that is not broken at any loop order. Subsequently, we discuss the lepton flavor violating processes, muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment, and relic density of dark matter, where we specify our dark matter candidate to be a singlet boson and briefly analyze the relic density by estimating the DM annihilation cross section. Finally, we present results for both the DM cross section and the muon $g-2$, satisfying the neutrino oscillation data as well as the constraints of lepton flavor violations.

2025-07-17, **The Making of a Community Dark Matter Dataset with the National Science Data Fabric**, Amy Roberts et.al., [2507.13297v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13297v1)

 Dark matter is believed to constitute approximately 85 percent of the universes matter, yet its fundamental nature remains elusive. Direct detection experiments, though globally deployed, generate data that is often locked within custom formats and non-reproducible software stacks, limiting interdisciplinary analysis and innovation. This paper presents a collaboration between the National Science Data Fabric (NSDF) and dark matter researchers to improve accessibility, usability, and scientific value of a calibration dataset collected with Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) detectors at the University of Minnesota. We describe how NSDF services were used to convert data from a proprietary format into an open, multi-resolution IDX structure; develop a web-based dashboard for easily viewing signals; and release a Python-compatible CLI to support scalable workflows and machine learning applications. These contributions enable broader use of high-value dark matter datasets, lower the barrier to entry for new collaborators, and support reproducible, cross-disciplinary research.

2025-07-17, **Effect of Dark matter and $σ$-cut potential on radial and non-radial oscillation modes in neutron stars**, Prashant Thakur et.al., [2507.13227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13227v1)

 We study the mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction equation of state (EoS) employing the relativistic mean-field model and investigate the effect of $\sigma$-cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut) and dark matter (NL DM) on the non-radial and radial oscillation modes of neutron stars. For NL-$\sigma$ cut, we include the $\sigma$-cut potential $U\_{cut} (\sigma)$ to study its effect. For the dark matter, we use the neutron decay anomaly model. For each model, we investigate two extreme EoSs, stiff and soft, that cover the entire allowed parameter range from the given model, consistent with the current astrophysical constraints. The EoS and the stellar properties, such as mass and radius, are calculated, and the effect of $\sigma$-cut and DM is discussed. Both non-radial and radial oscillation modes are computed in the general relativistic framework. We study the non-radial $f$ and $p\_1$ mode frequency, damping time, and some qusi-universal relations connecting the frequencies of the $f$-mode to the average density and compactness. The analysis showed that the $f$ and $p\_1$ mode frequencies at both 1.4~$M\_{\odot}$ and the maximum mass configuration are higher in the NL DM model compared to the NL and NL-$\sigma$ models. The consistent alignment between our prior parameterizations and current calculations strongly supports the existence of quasi-universal relations that hold true irrespective of the particular matter components involved. For the radial oscillations, we compute 10 lowest-order modes ($f$, $p$), study the radial perturbations as well as the large frequency separation with NL-$\sigma$ cut and NL DM EoS, showing that the microphysics involved in the NS EoS is imprinted on the frequency separation between different nodes.

2025-07-17, **Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects**, Youngsub Yoon et.al., [2507.13177v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13177v1)

 Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma\_g \equiv g\_{\rm obs}/g\_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}\_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta\_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log\_{10}\gamma\_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g\_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g\_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma\_g=1.26^{+0.12}\_{-0.10}$ ($\delta\_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g\_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma\_g=1.32^{+0.12}\_{-0.11}$ ($\delta\_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we take into account.

2025-07-17, **Probing the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a dark matter halo through astrophysical tests**, Tursunali Xamidov et.al., [2507.13147v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13147v1)

 We investigate a recently derived Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) immersed in a Dehnen-type $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)=(1,4,5/2)$ dark matter (DM) halo. We obtain constraints on the two model parameters, i.e., the halo core radius $r\_s$ and the DM density parameter $\rho\_s$ in both the weak and the strong field regimes. In the weak field, we model test particle geodesics and match the predicted perihelion shift to Mercury (Solar System) and the orbit of the S2 star data, obtaining upper limits on $r\_s$ and $\rho\_s$. In the strong field, we analyse twin high frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) from four microquasars (e.g., GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, XTE J1859+226, and XTE J1550-564). Because QPO frequencies depend only on the local spacetime curvature, they can serve as a probe of halo-induced deviations from general relativity. Our MCMC analysis produces posterior distributions for model parameters, revealing close agreement between the theoretical QPO frequencies and the observations for GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40. The same analysis also yielded best-fit values and upper bounds for each parameter. Our combined geodesic and QPO analysis demonstrates that timelike orbits and epicyclic oscillations can act as sensitive probes of DM halos around BHs, offering a pathway to distinguish Dehnen-type profiles from alternative DM distributions in future analysis and observations.

2025-07-17, **Revealing tensions in neutron star observations with pressure anisotropy**, Peter T. H. Pang et.al., [2507.13039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13039v1)

 Pressure isotropy, i.e., radial pressure equal to tangential pressure, is often assumed when studying neutron stars. However, multiple physical mechanisms, including pion/kaon condensation, magnetic fields, superfluidity, dark matter clustering, and violations of general relativity, can lead to a pressure anisotropy. This work presents a comprehensive measurement of pressure anisotropy in neutron stars. Our analysis incorporates both an extensive set of nuclear experimental constraints and multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational wave detections and electromagnetic observations. The Bayesian framework employed marginalizes over equation of state uncertainties and allows the anisotropy to vary between individual neutron stars. We find the Bayes factor for anisotropy against isotropy is $e^{0.46}=10^{0.20}=1.58\gtrsim 3:2$. Additionally, the posterior indicates a population-wide preference for negative pressure anisotropy, with GW170817 serving as the primary contributor. The individual variability suggests density-scale-independent anisotropy, potentially attributable to magnetic fields, dark matter clustering, or deviations from general relativity rather than phase transitions. While the evidence for pressure anisotropy remains inconclusive, these results demonstrate that pressure anisotropy can be utilized as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying missing physics in neutron star modeling or revealing tension among observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.

2025-07-17, **Supersonic Turbulence in Primordial Halos: A Comparison With and Without The Stream Velocity**, Avi Chen et.al., [2507.12993v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12993v1)

 Turbulence plays a critical role in regulating star formation in molecular clouds and is also observed in simulations of primordial halos that host Population III (Pop III) stars. The relative velocity between baryons and dark matter at the time of recombination is thought to be a source of turbulence in the early universe. In this paper, we study how this stream velocity affects the turbulence inside primordial halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations across the redshift range of $z = 30$ to $z = 20$. We find that at a fixed redshift, the stream velocity enhances turbulence in low-mass halos ($M \lesssim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M\_\odot}$) and suppresses it for high-mass halos ($M \gtrsim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M\_\odot}$). The enhancement in low-mass halos likely arises from residual kinetic energy introduced by the stream velocity, while the suppression in high-mass halos likely arises from a reduction in inflowing accretion-driven turbulence. This mass-dependent modulation of turbulence suggests that the initial conditions inside primordial halos are altered in the presence of the stream velocity, potentially influencing their fragmentation and the resulting star formation.

2025-07-17, **Deflection of light by dark matter supporting traversable wormholes in the framework of Kalb-Ramond gravity**, Susmita Sarkar et.al., [2507.12970v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12970v1)

 This study explores the possible formation of asymptotically flat traversable wormholes within dark matter halos under the framework of Kalb-Ramond gravity. The wormhole solutions are derived based on the King and Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter density profiles associated with anisotropic matter sources. For a particular set of parameters, the proposed shape functions are found to be positively increasing and satisfy all the essential geometric conditions along with the flare-out condition, thereby supporting asymptotically flat traversable wormholes. To study the underlying matter content responsible for the wormhole structures, we analyze the null energy condition at the wormhole throat and provide graphical representations of various energy conditions, highlighting both the regions where they are satisfied and where they are violated. The stability of the reported wormhole solutions is confirmed through the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. In addition, we explore several physical features of the wormhole configurations, including the embedding surface, complexity factor, active gravitational mass, and total gravitational energy. Moreover, we investigate the deflection of light by these wormholes, finding that the deflection angle approaches zero at large distances, where the wormhole's gravity is negligible, and diverges near the throat, where the gravitational influence is extremely strong.

2025-07-17, **Dark matter detection using optically trapped Rydberg atom tweezer arrays**, So Chigusa et.al., [2507.12860v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12860v1)

 A new scheme for detecting wave-like dark matter (DM) using Rydberg atoms is proposed. Recent advances in trapping and manipulating Rydberg atoms make it possible to use Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays for DM detection. We present a simple and innovative experimental procedure that searches for excitations of trapped Rydberg atoms due to DM-induced electric field. A scan over DM mass is enabled with the use of the Zeeman and diamagnetic shifts of energy levels under an applied external magnetic field. Taking dark photon DM as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed experiment can have high sensitivity enough to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark photon coupling strengths and masses.

2025-07-17, **Bar-driven Streaming Motions Mimic a Massive Bulge in the Inner Milky Way**, Junichi Baba et.al., [2507.12702v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12702v1)

 The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its mass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational potential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \lesssim 4$ kpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear stellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies remain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling and those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics. To investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic gravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to observational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks, dark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate synthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity method to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed terminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature arises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity method to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \sim 0.4$ kpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner gas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass concentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not require a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming motions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear, Milky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of dynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate mass inference in the inner Milky Way.

2025-07-16, **Reconstruction of Dark Matter and Baryon Density From Galaxies: A Comparison of Linear, Halo Model and Machine Learning-Based Methods**, Jordan Krywonos et.al., [2507.12530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12530v1)

 For many analyses in cosmology it is necessary to reconstruct the likely distribution of unobserved fields, such as dark matter or baryons, from observed luminous tracers. The dominant approach in cosmology has been to use the so-called halo model, which assumes radially symmetric profiles centered around luminous tracers such as galaxies. More recently, field-level machine learning methods have been proposed that can learn to estimate the unobserved field after being trained on simulations. However, it is unclear whether machine learning methods indeed significantly improve over linear methods or the halo model. In this paper we make a systematic comparison of different approaches to reconstruct dark matter and baryons from galaxy data using the CAMELS simulations. We find the best results using a combined GNN-CNN approach. We also provide a general analysis and visualization of the relationship of matter, baryons, halos and galaxies in these simulations to interpret our results.

2025-07-16, **Sommerfeld Enhancement from Quantum Forces for Dark Matter**, Steven Ferrante et.al., [2507.12522v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12522v1)

 Quantum forces are long-range interactions that arise only at the loop level. In this work, we study the Sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections caused by quantum forces. One notable feature of quantum forces is that they are subject to coherent enhancement in the presence of a background of mediator particles, which occurs in many situations in cosmology. We show that this effect has important implications for the Sommerfeld enhancement and DM physics. For the first time, we calculate the Sommerfeld factor induced by quantum forces for both bosonic and fermionic mediators, including the background corrections. We observe several novel features of the Sommerfeld factor that do not exist in the case of the Yukawa potential, such as temperature-induced resonance peaks for massless mediators, and having both enhancement and suppression effects in the same model with different DM masses. As direct applications, we discuss the DM phenomenology affected by the Sommerfeld enhancement from quantum forces, including thermal freeze-out, CMB spectral distortion from DM annihilation, and DM indirect detection. We highlight one particularly interesting effect relevant to indirect detection caused by the Sommerfeld enhancement in a non-thermal background of bosonic mediators in the galaxy, in which case the DM mass is shifted due to the background correction and the effective cross section for DM annihilation can be either enhanced or suppressed. This may be important for DM searches in the Milky Way.

2025-07-16, **Natural Ultralight Dark Matter: The Quadratic Twin**, Cédric Delaunay et.al., [2507.12514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12514v1)

 Scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is uniquely accessible to tabletop experiments such as clocks and interferometers, and its search has been the focus of a vast experimental effort. However, the scalar ULDM mass is not protected from radiative corrections, and the entirety of the parameter space within reach of experiments suffers from a severe naturalness problem. In this paper, we propose a new twin mechanism that protects the mass of the scalar ULDM. Our scalar ULDM is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson with quadratic couplings to the Standard Model (SM) and to a twin copy of the SM, with a mirror $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ symmetry exchanging each SM particle with its twin. Due to the mirror symmetry, the leading-order mass correction is quadratic in the (tiny) coupling while the linear order is canceled. This opens up vast regions of parameter space for natural quadratically coupled ultralight dark matter, within the sensitivity of existing and future experiments.

2025-07-16, **Bias with a Timer: Axion Domain Wall Decay and Dark Matter**, Sally Yuxuan Hao et.al., [2507.12268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12268v1)

 We explore the interplay of the post-inflationary QCD axion and a light scalar field for the axion domain wall decay and dark matter (DM). The scalar field possesses a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation, so that its interaction with the axion effectively serves as an explicit Peccei-Quinn (PQ) violating term. At a temperature below the PQ phase transition, the effective PQ violating interaction generates the axion potential which generally contains multiple degenerate vacua leading to the formation of the axion string-domain wall networks. The following QCD phase transition provides another contribution to the axion potential making domain walls decay before they dominate the Universe. Later, the scalar field starts to relax to the minimum of its potential with a vanishing VEV, turning off the effective PQ violating interaction so that the axion potential is aligned with the QCD vacuum. We keep track of the evolution of the axion-scalar system and discuss the production of the axion DM through the domain wall decay and the (trapped) misalignment. We find that the string-wall network in some cases can decay due to its structural instability, rather than the volume pressure, and the correct axion DM abundance is realized with the decay constant larger than that of the conventional post-inflationary QCD axion without fine tuning.

 We consider the hypothetical possibility that non-stationary glitch features in the noise of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors could be produced by small dark matter clumps that pass through the earth in the vicinity of gravitational-wave detectors. We first derive the gravitational-wave strain that would be generated by the passage of such a dark matter clump. We find that the strain is primarily sourced by the Newtonian gravitational acceleration of the mirrors toward the clump and by the Shapiro time delay of the photons in the laser beams as they pass through the gravitational potential created by the dark matter clump. We also find that the Newtonian acceleration effect dominates the gravitational-wave strain for both ground and space-based interferometers. We then compare our dark matter clump, gravitational-wave strain model to 84 Koi-Fish glitches detected during the second observing run of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian analysis. We find that all glitches but 9 can be confidently rejected as having originated from dark matter clumps. For the remaining glitches, the dark matter hypothesis cannot be excluded, and the maximum \textit{a posteriori} parameters yield minimum densities of about $10^{-7} {\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^3$, within the model. These results allow us to place the first direct upper limits with gravitational-wave detectors on the local over-density of dark matter in the form of clumps in the local neighborhood of Earth, namely $\rho\_{{\rm DM} \, {\rm clumps}} \lesssim 10^{-15} {\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^{-3}$.

 The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, based on the highly symmetric FLRW geometry, has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations. However, it faces unresolved issues, including CMB anomalies, the nature of dark matter, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry. These challenges highlight the limitations of the standard framework and raise questions about the validity of the assumed isotropic background geometry. A natural direction is to explore more general cosmological models that relax this assumption, potentially offering new insights into these problems. In this work, we examine a geometric approach to investigating the matter-antimatter asymmetry, grounded not in physics beyond the Standard Model, but in the structure of spacetime itself. While related questions have been raised previously in specific contexts, here we focus on the Bianchi IX cosmological model, motivated by its relevance to early-universe dynamics through the BKL conjecture and its potential role in generating angular momentum via global rotation. We study the Dirac spinor field in this background and derive the corresponding Dirac equation. Our goal is to investigate how spatial anisotropies and rotation can induce spectral asymmetries between particles and antiparticles. This paper lays the groundwork for a follow-up study analyzing specific solutions and their physical implications on matter-antimatter asymmetry.

2025-07-16, **Euclid preparation. Simulating thousands of Euclid spectroscopic skies**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2507.12116v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12116v1)

 We present two extensive sets of 3500+1000 simulations of dark matter haloes on the past light cone, and two corresponding sets of simulated (`mock') galaxy catalogues that represent the Euclid spectroscopic sample. The simulations were produced with the latest version of the PINOCCHIO code, and provide the largest, public set of simulated skies. Mock galaxy catalogues were obtained by populating haloes with galaxies using an halo occupation distribution (HOD) model extracted from the Flagship galaxy catalogue provided by Euclid Collaboration. The Geppetto set of 3500 simulated skies was obtained by tiling a 1.2 Gpc/h box to cover a light-cone whose sky footprint is a circle of 30 deg radius, for an area of 2763 deg$^2$ and a minimum halo mass of $1.5\times10^{11}$ Msun/h. The relatively small box size makes this set unfit for measuring very large scales. The EuclidLargeBox set consists of 1000 simulations of 3.38 Gpc/h, with the same mass resolution and a footprint that covers half of the sky, excluding the Milky Way zone of avoidance. From this we produced a set of 1000 EuclidLargeMocks on the 30 deg radius footprint, whose comoving volume is fully contained in the simulation box. We validated the two sets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point correlation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is consistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although we noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k>0.2 h/Mpc. We show cosmological parameter inference from these catalogues and demonstrate that using one realisation of EuclidLargeMocks in place of the Flagship mock produces the same posteriors, to within the expected shift given by sample variance. These simulated skies will be used for the galaxy clustering analysis of Euclid's Data Release 1 (DR1).

 We present a search for light dark matter particles through their interactions with atomic electrons and nucleons, utilizing PandaX-4T data with an effective exposure of 1.04 tonne$\cdot$year for ionization-only data and 1.20 tonne$\cdot$year for paired data. Our analysis focuses on the energy range (efficiency$>$0.01) of approximately 0.33 to 3 keV for nuclear recoils, and from 0.04 to 0.39 keV for electronic recoils. We establish the most stringent constraints on spin-independent dark matter-nucleon interactions within a mass range of 2.5 to 5.0 GeV/$c^2$, spin-dependent neutron-only interactions within 1.0 to 5.6 GeV/$c^2$, and spin-dependent proton-only interactions within 1.0 to 4.1 GeV/$c^2$. Additionally, our results improve the upper limits on the dark matter-electron scattering cross-section by a factor of 1.5 and 9.3 for heavy and light mediator scenarios respectively within 50 MeV/$c^2$ to 10 GeV/$c^2$, compared with previous best results.

 Generative machine learning models have been demonstrated to be able to learn low dimensional representations of data that preserve information required for downstream tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that flow matching based generative models can learn compact, semantically rich latent representations of field level cold dark matter (CDM) simulation data without supervision. Our model, CosmoFlow, learns representations 32x smaller than the raw field data, usable for field level reconstruction, synthetic data generation, and parameter inference. Our model also learns interpretable representations, in which different latent channels correspond to features at different cosmological scales.

 We report on the results of a comprehensive analysis of X-ray observations carried out with \textit{Chandra}, \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR B1853+01, located inside the W44 supernova remnant (SNR). Previous X-ray observations unveiled the presence of a fast-moving pulsar, PSR B1853+01, located at the southern edge of the W44 thermal X-ray emission region, as well as an elongated tail structure trailing the pulsar. Our analysis reveals, in addition, the presence of an ``outflow'' feature ahead of the pulsar extending for about 1 \arcmin ($\sim$ 1.0 pc at the distance of 3.2 kpc). At larger scales, the entire PWN seems to be surrounded by a faint, diffuse X-ray emission structure. The southern part of this structure displays the same unusual morphology as the ``outflow'' feature ahead of the pulsar, and extends along $\sim 6$ \arcmin ($\sim$ 5 pc) in the direction of the pulsar proper motion. In this report, a spatially-resolved spectral analysis for the different extended regions around PSR B1853+01 is carried out. For an updated value of the column density of $0.65\_{+0.46}^{-0.42} \times 10^{22} ~\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, a power-law fit to the ``outflow'' region yields a spectral index $\Gamma \approx 1.24\_{+0.23}^{-0.24}$, which is significantly harder than that of the pulsar ($\Gamma \approx 1.87\_{+0.48}^{-0.43}$) and the pulsar tail ($\Gamma \approx 2.01\_{+0.39}^{-0.38}$). We argue that both the ``outflow'' structure and the surrounding halo-like X-ray emission might be produced by high-energy particles escaping the PWN around PSR B1853+01, a scenario recently suggested also for other Bow-shock PWNe with jet-like structures and/or TeV halos.

2025-07-17, **Multi-wavelength study of the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant candidate \snr\ associated with the Calvera pulsar**, Emanuele Greco et.al., [2507.13210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13210v1)

 The candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G118.4+37.0 (Calvera's SNR), discovered as a faint radio ring at high Galactic latitude and coincident with extended Fermi/LAT gamma-ray emission, is likely associated to the X-ray pulsar 1RXS J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT \sim 0.15 keV, mildly under-solar N and o abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3. According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kya old and lies at a distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinti "Clump" region shows hared emission equally well described by a thermal (kT\sim 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma \sim 2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an isolated Alpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded

2025-07-17, **ALMA discovery of Punctum -- a highly polarized mm source in nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 4945**, E. Shablovinskaia et.al., [2507.13014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13014v1)

 We report the discovery of a highly polarized millimeter (mm) continuum source in the central region of NGC 4945, identified through ALMA Band 3 observations. This starburst Seyfert 2 galaxy contains numerous compact mm sources, yet only one - located approximately 3.4" (~60 pc) from the galactic center and unresolved with ~0.1" resolution - exhibits an unusually high polarization degree of 50% $\pm$ 14%, likely originating from non-thermal synchrotron radiation. The source is faint, yet clearly detected in two separate epochs of observation taken 14 days apart, with flux of 0.104 $\pm$ 0.018 and 0.125 $\pm$ 0.016 mJy, as well as in earlier ALMA observations, showing no variability at any timescale. The spectral index remains stable within large uncertainties, -1.8 $\pm$ 2.5 and -1.3 $\pm$ 2.5. The source, which we further refer to as Punctum due to its compactness, revealed no clear counterparts in existing X-ray or radio observations. Assuming association with the central region of NGC 4945, we estimate upper limits for its luminosity of ~1 $\times$ 10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 3-6 keV X-ray band (from archival Chandra data) and ~5 $\times$ 10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 23 GHz (from archival ATCA data). A comparison of the radio, mm (including polarization), and X-ray properties with known astrophysical sources emitting synchrotron radiation, such as accreting neutron stars, supernova remnants, and non-thermal galactic filaments, revealed no clear match in any of these scenarios. The exact nature of this highly polarized source remains undetermined.

2025-07-17, **Finding strangelets in cosmic rays from HESS J1731-347, a possible strange quark star using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory**, C. R. Das et.al., [2507.12817v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12817v1)

 The hypothesis that supernova remnants are key sources of Galactic cosmic rays gains support from evidence that HESS J1731-347 one of the few Galactic objects capable of accelerating hadronic cosmic rays to TeV energies may harbor an exotic strange quark star rather than a conventional neutron star. This conclusion stems from its unusually low mass and compact radius, which challenge standard neutron star models. If confirmed, such a quark star could generate cosmic rays through the transition from the two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) phase to the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase, potentially releasing strangelets, hypothetical strange quark matter particles. Detecting these strangelets in cosmic rays would provide groundbreaking evidence for quark matter. The future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), with its unmatched sensitivity and spectral resolution in the very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime, is uniquely positioned to search for their annihilation or decay signatures. We analyze theoretical predictions for these gamma-ray signals and evaluate CTA's potential to detect or constrain them. Additionally, we present an in-depth assessment of CTA observations of HESS J1731-347, focusing on spectral features that could confirm strangelet production. A positive detection would not only validate the existence of strange quark stars but also establish a direct link between quark matter and cosmic-ray acceleration, reshaping our understanding of compact objects and high-energy astrophysics.

2025-07-17, **Breaking the Mass-sheet Degeneracy in Time-delay Cosmology with Lensed and Unlensed Type Ia Supernovae**, Xiaolei Li et.al., [2507.12754v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12754v1)

 This study introduces an innovative framework aimed at overcoming the ongoing issue of mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in time-delay cosmography by incorporating observations of both gravitationally lensed and unlensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). By simultaneously using lensing magnification measurements $\mu^{\rm{obs}}$ and cosmic distance ratios ($D\_s/D\_{ds}$), we develop a Bayesian framework capable of breaking the MSD. Specifically, we reconstruct the distance-redshift and magnitude-redshift relations from unlensed Type Ia supernovae using Gaussian process to avoid dependence on specific cosmological models. Our framework shows substantial efficacy in resolving the MSD by imposing constraints on the MSD parameter $\lambda$. Furthermore, we extend this framework to analyze multiple gravitational lensing systems. The results show strong agreement with the fiducial MSD parameters used in the data simulation, confirming our method's effectiveness in mitigating the MSD. Ultimately, this technique enables the derivation of corrected time-delay distance measurements under the MSD, improving the precision of cosmological parameters inferred from strong lensing systems.

 We present a search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the first eight months of Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run, denoted O4a. We use four analyses which are sensitive to a wide range of potential signals lasting up to a few seconds in the 16-4096 Hz band. Excluding binary black hole merger candidates that were already identified by low-latency analyses, we find no statistically significant evidence for other gravitational-wave transients. We measure the sensitivity of the search for representative signals, including sine-Gaussians, Gaussian pulses, and white-noise bursts with different frequencies and durations, adopting a false alarm rate of 1 per 100 years as detection threshold. Depending on signal type, we find improvements over previous searches by factors of 2 to 10 in terms of sensitivity to strain amplitude and of 90% confidence upper limit on the rate density of sources. We also evaluate a variety of core-collapse supernova models and find that, for some models, the search could have detected gravitational waves from stellar core-collapse throughout the Milky Way. Finally, we consider neutron star f-modes associated with pulsar glitches and find that, assuming a source similar to the Vela Pulsar, the search could have detected a gravitational-wave signal from a glitch with fractional frequency change as small as $\sim 2$ to $6 \times 10^{-5}$ depending on the neutron star mass.

2025-07-16, **Investigating Universal Relations in Compact Stars featuring $Δ-$Admixed Exotic Dense Matter**, Vivek Baruah Thapa et.al., [2507.11956v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11956v1)

 The dense material in a compact star from a supernova remnant is beyond terrestrial experimentation, so phenomenological modeling is used to match astrophysical observations. This is crucial due to the complex sensitivity of compact star features to dense matter properties. Despite modeling flexibility, certain universal relationships among compact star features hold true, regardless of the matter model. Our study examines these universal relationships, focusing on the moment of inertia, tidal Love number, and quadrupole moment, as well as correlations between non-radial oscillation frequencies and star compactness. We consider baryonic stars with cores of heavier baryons. Our findings show that baryonic stars with cores of heavier baryons follow the universal relations, and the f-mode oscillation frequency's universality relative to tidal deformability is notable, with an error margin under 1$\%$.

 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) may contribute a significant amount of dust in the early universe. Freshly formed coolant molecules (e.g., CO) and warm dust can be found in CCSNe as early as ~100 d after the explosion, allowing the study of their evolution with time series observations. In the Type II SN 2023ixf, we aim to investigate the temporal evolution of the temperature, velocity, and mass of CO and compare them with other CCSNe, exploring their implications for the dust formation in CCSNe. From observations of velocity profiles of lines of other species (e.g., H and He), we also aim to characterize and understand the interaction of the SN ejecta with pre-existing circumstellar material (CSM). We present a time series of 16 near-infrared spectra of SN 2023ixf from 9 to 307 d, taken with multiple instruments: Gemini/GNIRS, Keck/NIRES, IRTF/SpeX, and MMT/MMIRS. The early (t<70 d) spectra indicate interaction between the expanding ejecta and nearby CSM. At t<20 d, intermediate-width line profiles corresponding to the ejecta-wind interaction are superposed on evolving broad P Cygni profiles. We find intermediate-width and narrow lines in the spectra until t<70 d, which suggest continued CSM interaction. We also observe and discuss high-velocity absorption features in H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ line profiles formed by CSM interaction. The spectra contain CO first overtone emission between 199 and 307~d after the explosion. We model the CO emission and find the CO to have a higher velocity (3000-3500 km/s) than that in Type II-pec SN 1987A (1800 - 2000 km/s) during similar phases (t=199-307 d) and a comparable CO temperature to SN 1987A. A flattened continuum at wavelengths greater than 1.5 $\mu$m accompanies the CO emission, indicating the presence of warm dust forming in the ejecta. The warm dust masses are estimated to be in the range of 1.0-2.3$\times$10$^{-5} M\_{\odot}$.
