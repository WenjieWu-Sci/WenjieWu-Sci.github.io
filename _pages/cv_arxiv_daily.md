2025-03-06, **Double Narrow-Line Signatures of Dark Matter Decay and New Constraints from XRISM Observations**, Wen Yin et.al., [2503.04726v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04726v1)

 We investigate the indirect detection search of the two-body decay of dark matter particles into final states containing a photon, a process predicted in various promising dark matter models such as axion-like particles and sterile neutrinos. Recent and near-future photon detectors with a resolution $ R \equiv \lambda/\Delta\lambda = O(1000) $ are primarily optimized for the velocity dispersion of dark matter in the Milky Way. When performing indirect detection of dark matter in objects other than the Milky Way, one should take into account the contribution from Milky Way dark matter. As a result, the dark matter signal observed by a detector is predicted to exhibit a two-peak structure in many targets, owing to the Doppler shift, differences in radial velocities and the good energy resolution. An analysis incorporating this two-peak effect was performed using the latest XRISM observation data of the Centaurus galaxy cluster~\cite{XRISM:2025axf}. Although, due to the relatively short observation time, our derived limit is weaker than some existing limits, among dark matter searches in galaxy clusters our limit is one of the most stringent (at least in certain mass ranges). We also perform the usual single-peak analysis, for considering the various scenarios, that prefer narrow-line photon from the faraway galaxy cluster. Future data releases from XRISM as well as other observatories will further strengthen our conclusions.

2025-03-06, **Abundance and properties of dark radiation from the cosmic microwave background**, Murali M. Saravanan et.al., [2503.04671v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04671v1)

 We study the cosmological signatures of new light relics that are collisionless like standard neutrinos or are strongly interacting. We provide a simple and succinct rephrasing of their physical effects in the cosmic microwave background, as well as the resulting parameter degeneracies with other cosmological parameters, in terms of the total radiation abundance and the fraction thereof that freely streams. In these more general terms, interacting and noninteracting light relics are differentiated by their respective decrease and increase of the free-streaming fraction, and, moreover, the scale-dependent interplay thereof with a common, correlated reduction of the fraction of matter in baryons. We then derive updated constraints on various dark-radiation scenarios with the latest cosmological observations, employing this language to identify the physical origin of the impact of each dataset. The "PR4" reanalyses of Planck CMB data prefer a larger primordial helium yield and therefore also slightly more radiation than the 2018 analysis, whose origin we identify in a number of poorly fit polarization measurements. Smaller free-streaming fractions are disfavored by the excess lensing of the CMB measured in lensing reconstruction data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. On the other hand, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument drive marginal detections of new, strongly interacting light relics due to that data's preference for lower matter fractions. Finally, we forecast measurements from the CMB-S4 experiment.

2025-03-06, **Impact of multi-messenger spectral modelling on blazar-neutrino associations**, Julian Kuhlmann et.al., [2503.04632v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04632v1)

 Blazars are interesting source candidates for astrophysical neutrino emission. Multi-messenger lepto-hadronic models based on proton-photon (p-gamma) interactions result in predictions for the neutrino spectra which are typically strongly peaked at high energies. In contrast, statistical analyses looking to associate blazars and neutrinos often assume a power-law spectral shape, putting the emphasis at lower energies. We aim to examine the impact of such spectral modelling assumptions on the associations of neutrinos with blazars. We use hierarchical\_nu, a Bayesian framework for point source searches, and incorporate the theoretical predictions for neutrino spectra through a dedicated spectral model and priors on the relevant parameters. Our spectral model is based on the predictions presented in Rodrigues et al. (2024) for a selection of intermediate and high synchrotron peaked blazars that have been connected with IceCube neutrino alert events. We apply our model to the 10 years of publicly available IceCube data, focusing on the Northern hemisphere. Out of 29 source candidates, we find five sources, including TXS 0506+056, that have an association probability greater than 0.5 to at least one event. The p-gamma spectra typically lead to a lower overall number of associated events compared to the power-law case, but retain or even enhance strong associations to high-energy events. Our results demonstrate that including more information from theoretical predictions can allow for more interpretable source-neutrino connections.

2025-03-06, **SN1987A bounds on neutrino quantum decoherence**, Christoph A. Ternes et.al., [2503.04573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04573v1)

 We obtain stringent bounds on neutrino quantum decoherence from the analysis of SN1987A data. We show that for the decoherence model considered here, which allows for neutrino-loss along the trajectory, the bounds are many orders of magnitude stronger than the ones that can be obtained from the analysis of data from reactor neutrino oscillation experiments or neutrino telescopes.

2025-03-06, **Super heavy dark matter origin of the PeV neutrino event: KM3-230213A**, Kazunori Kohri et.al., [2503.04464v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04464v1)

 The recent observation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT experiment offers a compelling avenue to explore physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we explore a simplest possibility that this event originates from the decay of a super-heavy dark matter (SHDM). We consider a minimal extension of the type-I seesaw by including a singlet scalar and a singlet fermion DM, both being odd under a $Z\_2$ symmetry. At high scale, the $Z\_2$ symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vev of the $Z\_2$ odd scalar, leading to i) mixing between DM and heavy right-handed neutrinos and ii) formation of domain walls (DW). In the former case, the decay of the DM to $\nu,h$ can give rise to the PeV neutrino event KM3-230213A. While, in the latter case, the disappearance of the DW can give rise to stochastic gravitational waves. We derive constraints on the DM lifetime as a function of DM mass ensuring consistency with IceCube, Auger upper limits and the observed KM3-230213A event. We found that KM3-230213A gives stringent constraint on DM mass ranging from $1.7\times10^8$ GeV to $5.5\times10^9$ GeV with lifetime $6.3\times10^{29}$ s to $3.6\times10^{29}$ s.

2025-03-06, **Enhancing DUNE Physics Sensitivity with Light and Charge Calorimetry**, Jogesh Rout et.al., [2503.04432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04432v1)

 We investigate the potential of light calorimetry in liquid argon time projection chambers and its intrinsic self compensation properties, emphasizing its advantages alongside conventional charge calorimetry. Previous studies have demonstrated that light calorimetry can achieve energy resolution comparable to advanced charge based techniques, particularly for GeV scale neutrinos. In this work, we explore the complementarity of light calorimetry with charge calorimetry for precision measurements of key physics parameters in the DUNE, including CP violation (CPV) and mass hierarchy determination. While charge calorimetry provides superior resolution in CP phase measurements, light calorimetry independently offers significant insights into CPV and mass hierarchy sensitivities. Furthermore, our exposure versus CPV sensitivity studies indicate that the $5\sigma$ discovery potential is reached faster using light and charge calorimetry than with the traditional TDR based reconstruction methods. These findings highlight the promising role of light calorimetry as a simple yet effective reconstruction method, serving as a complementary approach to enhance the physics capabilities of DUNE.

2025-03-06, **Searching for Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons with Gravitational Waves**, Silvia Gasparotto et.al., [2503.04624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04624v1)

 Ultralight Dark Matter (ULDM) offers an alternative to cold dark matter, characterized by wavelike behavior on galactic scales. This contribution summarizes our work~\cite{Blas:2024duy} on how solitonic cores induced by ULDM affect gravitational waves (GWs), enabling their detection through next-generation observatories like LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We show that continuous GWs from spinning neutron stars near the Galactic Center (GC) can probe solitons for \(m \lesssim 10^{-22}\, \mathrm{eV}\) and surpass current constraints on the ULDM couplings to the Standard Model for masses \(m \lesssim 10^{-20}\, \mathrm{eV}\). Additionally, GW modulation could reveal solitons in extragalactic systems, particularly in more massive halos, highlighting the broad potential of GW-based methods for uncovering ULDM properties.

2025-03-06, **Probing Dark Matter-Electron Interactions in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation**, Rahul Dhyani et.al., [2503.04539v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04539v1)

 In this article, we consider Dark Matter (DM) interactions, and study the same in the light of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) data. In particular, we focus on the DM-electron interactions. Assuming that such interactions are mediated by rather heavy mediators, we consider effective operators describing the relevant interaction terms in the lagrangian. The presence of such interaction terms lead to both DM annihilation and DM-electron scattering (drag). We focus on operators which lead to velocity-independent DM annihilation and DM-electron scattering cross-sections. Using the CMBR data, we study the the implications of both of these effects imposing constraints on the respective effective operators. This analysis underscores the importance of taking both scattering and annihilation processes into consideration in the study of DM interactions. We observe that the constraints on the DM annihilation and scattering cross-sections can change, up to about 14% and 13% respectively, for the benchmark scenarios we considered, depending on the mass of DM, as compared to the scenario where only DM annihilation is accounted for.

2025-03-06, **Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats**, Daniel Boyanovsky et.al., [2503.04533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04533v1)

 In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.

2025-03-06, **Enhancing the sensitivity to ultralight bosonic dark matter using signal correlations**, Soichiro Morisaki et.al., [2503.04484v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04484v1)

 In recent years, numerous experiments have been proposed and conducted to search for ultralight bosonic dark matter (ULBDM). Signals from ULBDM in such experiments are characterized by extremely narrow spectral widths. A near-optimal detection strategy is to divide the data based on the signal coherence time and sum the power across these segments. However, the signal coherence time can extend beyond a day, making it challenging to construct contiguous segments of such a duration due to detector instabilities. In this work, we present a novel detection statistic that can coherently extract ULBDM signals from segments of arbitrary durations. Our detection statistic, which we refer to as coherent SNR, is a weighed sum of data correlations, whose weights are determined by the expected signal correlations. We demonstrate that coherent SNR achieves sensitivity independent of segment duration and surpasses the performance of the conventional incoherent-sum approach, through analytical arguments and numerical experiments.

2025-03-06, **Baseline filtering and peak reconstruction for haloscope-like axion searches**, Andrea Gallo Rosso et.al., [2503.04288v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04288v1)

 Axions are well-motivated dark matter particles. Many experiments are looking for their experimental evidence. For haloscopes, the problem reduces to the identification of a peak above a noisy baseline. Its modeling, however, may problematic. State-of-the-art analysis rely on the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering, which is intrinsically affected by any possible over fluctuation, leading to biased results. In this paper we study the efficiency that different extensions of SG can provide in the peak reconstruction in a standard haloscope-like experiment. We show that, once the correlations among bins are taken into account, there is no appreciable difference. The standard SG remains the advisable choice because of its numerical efficiency.

2025-03-06, **The critical role of dark matter halos in driving star formation**, Jing Dou et.al., [2503.04243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04243v1)

 Understanding the physical mechanisms that drive star formation is crucial for advancing our knowledge of galaxy evolution. We explore the interrelationships between key galaxy properties associated with star formation, with a particular focus on the impact of dark matter halos. Given the sensitivity of atomic hydrogen (HI) to external processes, we concentrate exclusively on central spiral galaxies. We find that the molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio ($M\_{\rm H\_2}/M\_{\rm HI}$) strongly depends on stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR). In the star formation efficiency (SFE)-sSFR plane, most galaxies fall below the H$\_2$ fundamental formation relation (FFR), with SFE$\_{\rm HI}$ being consistently lower than SFE$\_{\rm H\_2}$. Using the improved halo masses derived by Zhao et al. (2025), for star-forming galaxies, both SFE$\_{\rm HI}$ and $M\_{\rm H\_2}/M\_{\rm HI}$ increase rapidly and monotonically with halo mass, indicating a higher efficiency in converting HI to H$\_2$ in more massive halos. This trend ultimately leads to the unsustainable state where SFE$\_{\rm HI}$ exceeds SFE$\_{\rm H\_2}$ at halo mass around $10^{12} \hbox{$M\_{\odot}$}$. For halos with masses exceeding $10^{12} \hbox{$M\_{\odot}$}$, galaxies predominantly experience quenching. We propose a plausible evolutionary scenario in which the growth of halo mass regulates the conversion of HI to H$\_2$, star formation, and the eventual quenching of galaxies. The disk size, primarily regulated by the mass, spin and concentration of the dark matter halo, also significantly influences HI to H$\_2$ conversion and star formation. These findings underscore the critical role of dark matter halos as a global regulator of galaxy-wide star formation, a key factor that has been largely underappreciated in previous studies.

2025-03-06, **Searching for Dark Photon Tridents Through Primordial Black Hole Signatures**, Kingman Cheung et.al., [2503.04175v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04175v1)

 The detection of gamma-ray signals from primordial black holes (PBHs) could provide compelling evidence for their role as a dark matter candidate, particularly through the observation of their Hawking radiation. Future gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM, and the next-generation telescopes, are poised to explore this possibility by measuring both Standard Model (SM) and beyond-the-SM particle emissions. A particularly promising avenue involves production of dark photons by PBHs, which is a hypothetical particle that decays into photons. In this work, we investigate the trident decay of dark photons focusing on their primary emission from PBHs. We assume that the dark photons produced via Hawking radiation decay into photons well before reaching Earth, thereby enhancing the detectable gamma-ray flux. The energy spectrum of the photons decaying from the dark photons is distinct from that of direct Hawking-radiated photons due to higher degree of freedom, leading to observable modifications in the gamma-ray signal. Using the asteroid-mass PBHs as a case study, we demonstrate that future gamma-ray missions could detect dark-photon signatures and distinguish them from conventional Hawking radiation. This approach enables the exploration of previously inaccessible parameter spaces in dark photon mass $m\_{A^{\prime}}$ and their coupling to photons, offering a novel pathway to uncover the properties of dark sectors and the nature of PBHs.

2025-03-06, **On the progenitor of the type Ia supernova remnant 0509-67.5**, Noam Soker et.al., [2503.04709v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04709v1)

 Based on the iron and hydrogen similar elliptical morphologies of the type Ia supernova (SN Ia) remnant (SNR) 0509-67.5, I suggest that the ambient gas shaped the SN ejecta, that it is a remnant of an old planetary nebula, and that the explosion was more or less spherical. Adding that there is no observed stellar survivor in this SNR, I conclude that the SN Ia scenarios that best account for the explosion of this SN inside a planetary nebula (SNIP), are the lonely white dwarf scenarios, i.e., the core-degenerate (CD) and the double degenerate (DD) with merger to explosion delay (MED) time, i.e., the DD-MED scenario. Other scenarios encounter challenges, but I cannot completely rule them out. If true, the suggestion of SNR~0509-67.5 being a SNIP implies that the fraction of SNIPs might be higher than the previously estimated 50 percent of all normal SNe Ia. In the frame of the CD and the DD-MED scenarios, I attribute the observed double-shell structure in calcium to Rayleigh-Taylor instability during the explosion process: the caps of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability mushrooms form the outer shell. Instabilities during the explosion process might form clumps of some elements moving much faster than their mean velocity, possibly explaining fast-moving intermediate-mass elements.

2025-03-06, **Preference for evolving dark energy in light of the galaxy bispectrum**, Zhiyu Lu et.al., [2503.04602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04602v1)

 We analyse pre-DESI clustering data using a dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ parametrised by $(w\_0, w\_a)$, finding a $2.8-3.9\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy over the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ when combined with cosmic microwave background data from Planck and supernova data from Pantheon+, Union3, or DESY5. Our constraints, consistent with DESI Y1 results, are derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum of SDSS/BOSS galaxies using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) at one loop. The evidence remains robust across analysis variations but disappears without the one-loop bispectrum. When combining DESI baryon acoustic oscillations with BOSS full-shape data, while marginalising over the sound horizon in the latter to prevent unaccounted correlations, the significance increases to $3.7-4.4\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. Using a data-driven reconstruction of $w(z)$, we show that the evidence arises from deviations from $\Lambda$ at multiple redshifts. In addition, our findings are interpreted within the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE), from which we explicitly track the non-standard time evolution in EFTofLSS predictions. For perturbatively stable theories in the $w < -1$ regime, the evidence persists in the clustering limit $(c\_s^2 \rightarrow 0)$ when higher-derivative corrections are present, as well as in the quasi-static limit $(c\_s^2 \rightarrow 1)$ when additional EFTofDE parameters are considered.

2025-03-06, **Magnetars**, Nanda Rea et.al., [2503.04442v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04442v1)

 Magnetars are the most magnetic objects in the Universe, serving as unique laboratories to test physics under extreme magnetic conditions that cannot be replicated on Earth. They were discovered in the late 1970s through their powerful X-ray flares, and were subsequently identified as neutron stars characterized by steady and transient emission across the radio, infrared, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. In this chapter, we summarize the current state of our experimental and theoretical knowledge on magnetars, as well as briefly discussing their relationship with supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, and the transient multi-band sky at large.

2025-03-06, **HERACLES++: a multi-dimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing**, Lou Roussel-Hard et.al., [2503.04428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428v1)

 Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1-D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3-D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1-D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability of running HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3-D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future development is to extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.
