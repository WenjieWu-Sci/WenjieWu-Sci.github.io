2023-06-15, **Modified gravity and massive neutrinos: constraints from the full shape analysis of BOSS galaxies and forecasts for Stage IV surveys**, Chiara Moretti et.al., [2306.09275v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09275v1)

 We constrain the growth index $\gamma$ by performing a full-shape analysis of the power spectrum multipoles measured from the BOSS DR12 data. We adopt a theoretical model based on the Effective Field theory of the Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) and focus on two different cosmologies: $\gamma$CDM and $\gamma \nu$CDM, where we also vary the total neutrino mass. We explore different choices for the priors on the primordial amplitude $A\_s$ and spectral index $n\_s$, finding that informative priors are necessary to alleviate degeneracies between the parameters and avoid strong projection effects in the posterior distributions. Our tightest constraints are obtained with 3$\sigma$ Planck priors on $A\_s$ and $n\_s$: we obtain $\gamma = 0.647 \pm 0.085$ for $\gamma$CDM and $\gamma = 0.612^{+0.075}\_{-0.090}$, $M\_\nu < 0.30$ for $\gamma \nu$CDM at 68\% c.l., in both cases $\sim 1\sigma$ consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM prediction $\gamma \simeq 0.55$. Additionally, we produce forecasts for a Stage-IV spectroscopic galaxy survey, focusing on a DESI-like sample. We fit synthetic data-vectors for three different galaxy samples generated at three different redshift bins, both individually and jointly. Focusing on the constraining power of the Large Scale Structure alone, we find that forthcoming data can give an improvement of up to $\sim 85\%$ in the measurement of $\gamma$ with respect to the BOSS dataset when no CMB priors are imposed. On the other hand, we find the neutrino mass constraints to be only marginally better than the current ones, with future data able to put an upper limit of $M\_\nu < 0.27~{\rm eV}$. This result can be improved with the inclusion of Planck priors on the primordial parameters, which yield $M\_\nu < 0.18~{\rm eV}$.

2023-06-15, **Explaining the $B_{d,s}\rightarrow {K^{(*)}\bar K^{(*)}}$ non-leptonic puzzle and charged-current $B$-anomalies via scalar leptoquarks**, Javier M. Lizana et.al., [2306.09178v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09178v1)

 We present a model based on $S\_1$ scalar leptoquarks to solve the tension observed in the recently proposed non-leptonic optimized observables $L\_{K^{*} \bar{K}^{*}}$ and $L\_{K \bar{K}}$. These observables are constructed as ratios of U-spin related decays based on $B\_{d,s}^0\rightarrow {K^{(*)0}\bar K^{(*)0}}$. The model gives a one-loop contribution to the Wilson coefficient of the chromomagnetic dipole operator needed to explain the tension in both non-leptonic observables, while naturally avoiding large contributions to the corresponding electromagnetic dipoles. The necessary chiral enhancement comes from an $O(1)$ Yukawa coupling with a TeV-scale right-handed neutrino running in the loop. We endow the model with a $U(2)$ flavor symmetry, necessary to protect light-family flavor observables that otherwise would be in tension. Furthermore, we show that the same $S\_1$ scalar leptoquark is capable of simultaneously explaining the hints of lepton flavor universality violation observed in charged-current $B$-decays. The model therefore provides a potential link between two puzzles in $B$-physics and TeV-scale neutrino mass generation. Finally, the combined explanation of the $B$-physics puzzles unavoidably results in an enhancement of $\mathcal{B}(B\rightarrow K \nu \bar \nu)$, yielding a value close to present bounds.

2023-06-15, **A simplest modular $S_3$ model for leptons**, Davide Meloni et.al., [2306.09028v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09028v1)

 We present minimalist constructions for lepton masses and mixing based on flavour symmetry under the modular group $\Gamma\_N$ of lowest level $N=2$. As opposed to the only existing model of $\Gamma\_2\cong S\_3$ formulated in a SUSY framework, the only non-SM field is the modulus $\tau$, and a generalised CP symmetry is implemented. Charged-leptons masses are reproduced through symmetry arguments, without requiring fine-tuning of the free parameters. As a result, all lepton observables (masses and mixing) are reproduced within $1\sigma$ experimental range using a minimum of nine free real parameters (including the real and imaginary parts of the modulus). A normal ordering for the neutrino masses is predicted. We also obtain predictions for the CP violating phases: the Dirac CP phase is predicted around $1.6\pi$, the Majorana phases lie in narrow regions near $\pm \pi$. The sum of neutrino masses is within the current bound at $\sim 0.09\,\text{eV}$. Furthermore, we provide predictions for the neutrinoless double beta decay and tritium decay effective masses, around $20\,\text{meV}$. Given the reduced number of free input parameters as compared to the existing literature on modular $S\_3$, this work renews interest for a unified predictive model of quark-lepton sectors based on $\Gamma\_2\cong S\_3$.

2023-06-15, **Neutrino signal from Seyfert galaxies**, A. Neronov et.al., [2306.09018v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09018v1)

 IceCube collaboration has previously reported an evidence for neutrino signal from a Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. This may suggest that all Seyfert galaxies emit neutrinos. To test this hypothesis, we identify the best candidate neutrino sources among nearby Seyfert galaxies, based on their hard X-ray properties. Only two other sources, NGC 4151 and NGC 3079 are expected to be detectable in 10 years of IceCube data. We find an evidence for neutrino signal from both sources in publicly available ten-year IceCube dataset. The chance coincidence probability to find the observed neutrino count excesses in the directions of the two out of two expected sources, in addition to the previously reported brightest source, is p<2.6e-7. This corresponds to the detection of Seyfert galaxies as a neutrino source class.

2023-06-14, **Dark Matter from a Radiative Inverse Seesaw Majoron Model**, Cesar Bonilla et.al., [2306.08453v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08453v1)

 We propose a Majoron-like extension of the Standard Model with an extra global $U(1)\_X$-symmetry where neutrino masses are generated through an inverse seesaw mechanism at the 1-loop level. In contrast to the tree-level inverse seesaw, our framework contains dark matter (DM) candidates stabilized by a residual $\mathcal{Z}\_2$-symmetry surviving spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)\_X$-group. We explore the case in which the DM is a Majorana fermion. Furthermore, we provide parameter space regions allowed by current experimental constraints coming from the dark matter relic abundance, (in)direct detection, and charged lepton flavor violation.

2023-06-14, **Evolution of Tau-Neutrino Lepton Number in Protoneutron Stars due to Active-Sterile Neutrino Mixing**, Anupam Ray et.al., [2306.08209v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08209v1)

 We present an approximate treatment of the mixing between $\nu\_{\tau}$ ($\bar\nu\_{\tau}$) and a sterile species $\nu\_s$ ($\bar\nu\_s$) with a vacuum mass-squared difference of $\sim$ 10$^2$-10$^3$ keV$^2$ in protoneutron stars created in core-collapse supernovae. Including production of sterile neutrinos through both resonant flavor conversion and collisions, we track the evolution of the $\nu\_{\tau}$ lepton number due to both escape of sterile neutrinos and diffusion. Our approach provides a reasonable treatment of the pertinent processes discussed in previous studies and serves a pedagogical purpose to elucidate the relevant physics. We also discuss refinements needed to study more accurately how flavor mixing with sterile neutrinos affects protoneutron star evolution.

 Measurements of 21cm intensity mapping (IM) during the dark ages can potentially provide us with an unprecedented window on high redshifts and small scales. One of the main advantages this can bring involves the possibility to probe the nature of dark matter. Tests of dark matter models with the large-scale structure of the Universe are limited by non-linearities and astrophysical effects, which are not present for IM measurements during the dark ages. In this paper we focus on constraining the model in which dark matter is comprised, totally on in part, by ultra-light axion-like particles around the $10^{-18}-10^{-22}$ eV mass scale. For this model, the angular power spectrum of 21cm brightness temperature fluctuations will exhibit a small-scale suppression. However, this effect is intertwined with the imprint of baryon-dark matter relative velocity at recombination, causing at the same time an enhancement at large-scales, which is affected by the mass and abundance of axion dark matter. In this work we forecast how future radio arrays will be able to constrain ultra-light axion mass through both these effects on the angular power spectrum.

2023-06-15, **GN-z11: The environment of an AGN at $z=$10.603**, Jan Scholtz et.al., [2306.09142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09142v1)

 Recent observations with the \textit{James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) have further refined the spectroscopic redshift of GN-z11, one of the most distant galaxies identified with the \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope (HST) at $z=10.603$. The presence of extremely dense gas ($>10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$), the detection of high-ionisation lines and of CII*1335 emission, as well as the presence of an ionisation cone, indicate that GN-z11 also hosts an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Further photometric and spectroscopic follow-up demonstrates that it lies in a large-scale, overdense structure with possible signatures of Population III (PopIII) stars in its halo. Surprisingly, Ly$\alpha$ has also been detected despite the expected largely neutral inter-galactic medium at such a redshift. We exploit recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations to demonstrate that the Ly$\alpha$ emission in GN-z11 is part of an extended halo with a minimum size of 0.8--3.2 kpc, depending on the definition used to derive the halo size. The surface brightness of the Ly$\alpha$ halo around GN-z11 appears consistent with Ly$\alpha$ halos observed around $z\sim6$ quasars. At the wavelength of Ly$\alpha$ at $z\sim$10.6, we identify three other emission line candidates within the IFU Field-of-View with no UV rest-frame counterpart visible in deep images from the JWST/NIRCam. If confirmed, this could be the first evidence that the local region of GN-z11 represents a candidate protocluster core, forming just 400 Myr after the Big Bang. We give a first estimate of the dark matter halo mass of this structure ($M\_h$=2.96$^{+0.44}\_{-0.39} \times$10$^{10}$ M$\_{\odot}$), consistent with a Coma-like cluster progenitor.

2023-06-14, **Higher Order Corrections to the Effective Field Theory of Low-energy Axions**, Bryan Cordero-Patino et.al., [2306.08721v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08721v1)

 Dark matter (DM) can be composed of a collection of axions, or axion-like particles (ALPs), whose existence is due to the spontaneous breaking of the Peccei-Quinn $U(1)$ symmetry which is the most compelling solution of the strong $CP$-problem of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Axions must be spin-$0$ particles with very small masses and extremely weak interactions with themselves as well as with the particles that constitute the Standard Model. In general, the physics of axions is detailed by a quantum field theory of a real scalar field, $\phi$. Nevertheless, it is more convenient to implement a non-relativistic effective field theory with a complex scalar field, $\psi$, to characterize the mentioned axions in the low-energy regime. A possible application of this equivalent description is to study the collapse of cold dark matter into more complex structures. There have been a few derivations of effective Lagrangians for the complex field $\psi$; resulting to be all equivalent after a nonlocal-space transformation between $\phi$ and $\psi$ was found, and some other corrections were introduced. Our contribution herein is to further provide higher order corrections, in particular, we compute the effective field theory Lagrangian up to order $(\psi^\ast\psi)^5$, incorporating also the fast-oscillating field fluctuations into the dominant slowly-varying non-relativistic field.

2023-06-14, **Heating Galaxy Clusters with Interacting Dark Matter**, Yutaro Shoji et.al., [2306.08679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08679v1)

 The overcooling of cool core clusters is a persistent puzzle in the astrophysics of galaxy clusters. We propose that it may naturally be resolved via interactions between the baryons of the intracluster medium (ICM) and its dark matter (DM). DM-baryon interactions can inject heat into the ICM to offset bremmstrahlung cooling, but these interactions are also strongly constrained by existing experiments and astrophysical observations. We survey existing constraints and combine these with the energetic needs of an observed sample of cool core clusters. We find that a robust parameter space exists for baryon-DM scattering solutions to the cooling flow problem, provided that only a sub-component of DM interacts strongly with the baryons. Interestingly, baryon-DM scattering is a thermally stable heating source so long as the baryon temperature is greater than $1/3-1/2$ the DM temperature, a condition that seems to be satisfied observationally.

2023-06-14, **Post-inflationary production of particle Dark Matter: non-minimal Natural inflationary scenarios**, Anish Ghoshal et.al., [2306.08675v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08675v1)

 We investigate the production of non-thermal fermionic dark matter particles during the reheating era following slow roll inflation, driven by axion-like pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, $\varphi$, that is non-minimally coupled to the curvature scalar, ${\cal R}$. We consider two types of non-minimal coupling, one of which is $\xi \varphi^2 {\cal R}$ (referred to as NM-N), and the other one is $\alpha\left( 1+ \cos\left(\frac{\varphi}{f\_a}\right)\right)$ (referred to as NMP-N), where $\alpha$ and $\xi$ are dimensionless parameters and $f\_a$ is an energy scale. We determine benchmark values for both inflationary scenarios satisfying current bounds from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation measurement and find the mass of inflaton to be $\sim {\cal O}\left(10^{12}\right) \text{GeV}$ for both inflationary scenarios and tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r\sim 0.0177$ (for NM-N) and $\sim 0.0097$ (for NMP-N) which fall inside $1-\sigma$ contour on scalar spectral index versus $r$ plane of Planck 2018+Bicep 3+Keck Array 2018 joint analysis, and can be probed by future CMB observations e.g. Simons Observatory. We then show that dark matter particles produced from the decay of inflaton can fully match the present-day cold dark matter (CDM) yield, as well as other cosmological constraints, if the coupling value between inflaton and dark matter, $y\_\chi$, and the dark matter mass, $m\_\chi$, are within the range $10^{-6}\gtrsim y\_\chi\gtrsim 10^{-17}$ and ${\cal O}(1\text{GeV})\lesssim m\_\chi\lesssim m\_\phi/2$, where $m\_\phi$ denotes the mass of inflaton. The exact range of $y\_\chi$ and $m\_\chi$ varies with different benchmark values as well as parameters of inflation, like energy scale of inflation and $r$, some of which are within the reach of next generation CMB experiments.

2023-06-14, **Densities and mass assembly histories of the Milky Way satellites are not a challenge to $Λ$CDM**, Andrey Kravtsov et.al., [2306.08674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08674v1)

 We use the \texttt{GRUMPY} galaxy formation model based on a suite of zoom-in, high-resolution, dissipationless $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) simulations of the Milky Way (MW) sized haloes to examine total matter density within the half-mass radius of stellar distribution, $\rho\_{\rm tot}(<r\_{1/2})$, of satellite dwarf galaxies around the MW hosts and their mass assembly histories. We compare model results to $\rho\_{\rm tot}(<r\_{1/2})$ estimates for observed dwarf satellites of the Milky Way spanning their entire luminosity range. We show that observed MW dwarf satellites exhibit a trend of decreasing $\rho\_{\rm tot}(<r\_{1/2})$ with increasing stellar mass. This trend is in general agreement with the trend predicted by the model. None of the observed satellites are overly dense compared to the results of our $\Lambda$CDM-based model. We also show that although the halo mass of many satellite galaxies is comparable to the halo mass of the MW progenitor at $z> 10$, at these early epochs halos that survive as satellites to $z=0$ are located many virial radii away from the MW progenitors and thus do not have a chance to merge with it. Our results show that neither the densities estimated in observed Milky Way satellites nor their mass assembly histories pose a challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model. In fact, the broad agreement between density trends with the stellar mass of the observed and model galaxies can be considered as yet another success of the model.

2023-06-14, **Keck Spectroscopy of NGC 1052-DF9: Stellar Populations in the Context of the NGC 1052 Group**, Jonah S. Gannon et.al., [2306.08540v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08540v1)

 In this study, we use Keck/KCWI spectroscopy to measure the age, metallicity and recessional velocity of NGC~1052-DF9 (DF9), a dwarf galaxy in the NGC~1052 group. We compare these properties to those of two other galaxies in the group, NGC~1052-DF2 and NGC~1052-DF4, which have low dark matter content. The three galaxies are proposed constituents of a trail of galaxies recently hypothesised to have formed as part of a ``bullet dwarf'' collision. We show that the ages and total metallicities of the three galaxies are within uncertainties of one another which may be expected if they share a related formation pathway. However, the recessional velocity we recover for DF9 (1680 $\pm$ 10 km s$^{-1}$) is higher than predicted for a linearly projected interpretation of the ``bullet dwarf'' trail. DF9 is then either not part of the trail or the correlation of galaxy velocities along the trail is not linear in 2D projection due to their 3D geometry. After examining other proposed formation pathways for the galaxies, none provide a wholly satisfactory explanation for all of their known properties. We conclude further work is required to understand the formation of this interesting group of galaxies.

2023-06-14, **Search for Baryogenesis and Dark Matter in $B^{+} \rightarrow ψ_{\text{D}} + \text{p} $ Decays at BABAR**, The BABAR Collaboration et.al., [2306.08490v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08490v1)

 A new dark sector anti-baryon, denoted $\psi\_{\text{D}}$, could be produced in decays of $B$ mesons. This letter presents a search for $B^{+} \rightarrow \psi\_{\text{D}} + \text{p}$ (and the charge conjugate) decays in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilations at 10.58 GeV, using data collected in the ~\babar~ experiment. Data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 398 fb$^{-1}$ are analyzed. No evidence for a signal is observed. Branching fraction upper limits in the range from $10^{-7} $ -- $ 10^{-5}$ are obtained at 90$\%$ confidence level for masses of 1.0 $< m\_{\psi\_{\text{D}}} < $ 4.3 GeV/c$^{2}$.

2023-06-14, **Dark energy-matter equivalence by the evolution of cosmic equation of state**, Anna Chiara Alfano et.al., [2306.08396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08396v1)

 We consider a model-independent approach to constrain the equivalence redshift, $z\_{eq}$, at which dark energy, baryons and cold dark matter equate their magnitudes. To this aim, in the context of a homogeneous and isotropic universe, we first consider a generic model where the dark energy contribution is provided by an unknown function of barotropic fluids. Afterwards, we compute the deceleration and jerk parameters, evaluating at our epoch, namely $z=0$, and at $z=z\_{eq}$. Thus, by Taylor expanding around current time the Hubble, luminosity and angular distances, we substitute the theoretical expressions obtained from the aforementioned generic dark energy model, defining a correspondence between quantities evaluated at $z=0$ and $z=z\_{eq}$. In so doing, we directly fit these quantities by means of current data sets, involving the most recent Pantheon type IA supernovae, baryonic acoustic oscillation and differential Hubble points. We consider two hierarchies in our fitting procedures and compare our findings in the spatially-flat universe first and including spatial curvature, later. We assess constraints on the overall equation of state of the universe and its first derivative. We compare our results with those predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Specifically, our findings are in agreement at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level, assuming a constant dark energy term. However, our analysis does not rule out the possibility of a slight evolution of dark energy, indicating a small deviation from the scenario of a pure cosmological constant. In particular, the possible departures appear consistent with a phenomenological $\omega$CDM model, rather than more complicated dark energy parameterizations.

2023-06-15, **Millimeter Observations of the Type II SN2023ixf: Constraints on the Proximate Circumstellar Medium**, Edo Berger et.al., [2306.09311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09311v1)

 We present 1.3 mm (230 GHz) observations of the recent and nearby Type II supernova, SN2023ixf, obtained with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 2.6-18.6 days after explosion. The observations were obtained as part the SMA Large Program POETS (Pursuit of Extragalactic Transients with the SMA). We do not detect any emission at the location of SN2023ixf, with the deepest limits of $L\_\nu(230\,{\rm GHz})\lesssim 8.6\times 10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ at 2.7 and 7.7 days, and $L\_\nu(230\,{\rm GHz})\lesssim 3.4\times 10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ at 18.6 days. These limits are about a factor of 2 times dimmer than the mm emission from SN2011dh (IIb), about an order of magnitude dimmer compared to SN1993J (IIb) and SN2018ivc (IIL), and about 30 times dimmer than the most luminous non-relativistic SNe in the mm-band (Type IIb/Ib/Ic). Using these limits in the context of analytical models that include synchrotron self-absorption and free-free absorption we place constraints on the proximate circumstellar medium around the progenitor star, to a scale of $\sim 2\times 10^{15}$ cm, excluding the range $\dot{M}\sim {\rm few}\times 10^{-6}-10^{-2}$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ (for a wind velocity, $v\_w=115$ km s$^{-1}$, and ejecta velocity, $v\_{\rm eje}\sim (1-2)\times 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$). These results are consistent with an inference of the mass loss rate based on optical spectroscopy ($\sim 2\times 10^{-2}$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for $v\_w=115$ km s$^{-1}$), but are in tension with the inference from hard X-rays ($\sim 7\times 10^{-4}$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for $v\_w=115$ km s$^{-1}$). This tension may be alleviated by a non-homogeneous and confined CSM, consistent with results from high-resolution optical spectroscopy.

2023-06-15, **New Dimensions of Galactic Chemical Evolution**, David H. Weinberg et.al., [2306.09133v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09133v1)

 Dramatic recent progress in understanding galactic chemical evolution (GCE) has been driven partly by direct observations of the distant past with HST and JWST of stellar abundances from giant high-resolution spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH) and the complementary power of Gaia astrometry and photometry. Focusing on archaeology, I give a rapid-fire, and I hope synthesizing, review of work my collaborators and I have done on theoretical modeling and observational interpretation. I discuss (1) the interleaved but distinguishable roles of stellar scale astrophysics and galactic scale astrophysics in governing GCE, (2) the use of abundance ratio trends to empirically infer nucleosynthetic yields, (3) the uncertainty in the overall scale of yields and its degeneracy with the importance of galactic outflows, (4) the emergence of equilibrium in GCE, (5) the dimensionality of the stellar distribution in chemical abundance space, and (6) insights from chemical abundances on the early history of the Milky Way, including measurements of the intrinsic scatter of abundance ratios in metal-poor stars (-2 < [Fe/H] < -1), suggesting that a typical halo star at this metallicity is enriched by the products of $N \sim 50$ supernovae mixed over $\sim 10^5 M\_\odot$ of star-forming gas.

2023-06-15, **Broad-emission-line dominated hydrogen-rich luminous supernovae**, P. J. Pessi et.al., [2306.08880v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08880v1)

 Hydrogen-rich Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most frequently observed class of core-collapse SNe (CCSNe). However, most studies that analyse large samples of SNe II lack events with absolute peak magnitudes brighter than -18.5 mag at rest-frame optical wavelengths. Thanks to modern surveys, the detected number of such luminous SNe II (LSNe II) is growing. There exist several mechanisms that could produce luminous SNe II. The most popular propose either the presence of a central engine (a magnetar gradually spinning down or a black hole accreting fallback material) or the interaction of supernova ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM) that turns kinetic energy into radiation energy. In this work, we study the light curves and spectral series of a small sample of six LSNe II that show peculiarities in their H$\alpha$ profile, to attempt to understand the underlying powering mechanism. We favour an interaction scenario with CSM that is not dense enough to be optically thick to electron scattering on large scales -- thus, no narrow emission lines are observed. This conclusion is based on the observed light curve (higher luminosity, fast decline, blue colours) and spectral features (lack of persistent narrow lines, broad H$\alpha$ emission, lack of H$\alpha$ absorption, weak or nonexistent metal lines) together with comparison to other luminous events available in the literature. We add to the growing evidence that transients powered by ejecta-CSM interaction do not necessarily display persistent narrow emission lines.

2023-06-14, **On the Formation of GW190521-like Binary Black Hole Merger Systems**, Zhe Cui et.al., [2306.08441v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08441v1)

 GW190521 is the most massive merging binary black hole (BBH) system detected so far. At least one of the component BHs was measured to lie within the pair-instability supernova (PISN) mass gap ($\sim 50-135\;{\rm M}\_{\odot}$), making its formation a mystery. However, the transient observed signal allows alternative posterior distributions. There was suggestion that GW190521 could be an intermediate-mass ratio inspiral (IMRI), with the component masses $m\_1\sim 170\;{\rm M}\_{\odot}$ and $m\_2\sim 16 \;{\rm M}\_{\odot}$, happening to straddle the PISN mass gap. Under this framework, we perform binary population synthesis to explore the formation of GW190521-like systems via isolated binary evolution. We numerically calculate the binding energy parameter for massive stars at different metallicities, and employ them in our calculation for common envelope evolution. Our results prefer that the progenitor binaries formed in metal-poor environment with $\rm Z\leq0.0016$. The predicted merger rate density within redshift $z=1.1$ is $\sim 4\times 10^{-5}-5\times 10^{-2} \,\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$. We expect that such events are potentially observable by upcoming both space and ground-based gravitational wave detectors.
