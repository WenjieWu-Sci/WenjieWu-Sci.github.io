2023-11-02, **Search for Periodic Time Variations of the Solar $^8$B Neutrino Flux Between 1996 and 2018 in Super-Kamiokande**, K. Abe et.al., [2311.01159v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01159v1)

 We report a search for time variations of the solar $^8$B neutrino flux using 5,804 live days of Super-Kamiokande data collected between May 31, 1996, and May 30, 2018. Super-Kamiokande measured the precise time of each solar neutrino interaction over 22 calendar years to search for solar neutrino flux modulations with unprecedented precision. Periodic modulations are searched for in a data set comprised of five-day interval solar neutrino flux measurements with a maximum likelihood method. We also applied the Lomb-Scargle method to this data set to compare it with previous reports. The only significant modulation found is due to the elliptic orbit of the Earth around the Sun. The observed modulation is consistent with astronomical data: we measured an eccentricity of (1.53$\pm$0.35)\,\%, and a perihelion shift is ($-$1.5$\pm$13.5)\,days.

2023-11-02, **Wash-in leptogenesis after the evaporation of primordial black holes**, Kai Schmitz et.al., [2311.01089v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01089v1)

 Wash-in leptogenesis is a powerful mechanism to generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe that treats right-handed-neutrino interactions on the same footing as electroweak sphaleron processes: as mere spectator processes acting on the background of chemical potentials in the Standard Model plasma. Successful wash-in leptogenesis requires this chemical background to be CP-violating, which can be achieved by violating any of the more than ten global charges that are conserved in the Standard Model at very high temperatures. In this paper, we demonstrate that the primordial charge asymmetries required for wash-in leptogenesis can be readily produced by evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs). Our argument is based on the fact that the Hawking radiation emitted by PBHs contains more or less any state in the particle spectrum. Therefore, if heavy states with CP-violating decays are present in the ultraviolet, PBH evaporation will unavoidably lead to the production of these states. We illustrate this scenario by means of a simple toy model where PBH evaporation leads to the production of heavy particles that we call asymmetrons and whose decay results in a primordial charge asymmetry for right-handed electrons, which in turn sets the initial conditions for wash-in leptogenesis. We focus on the parameter region where the decay of the initial thermal asymmetron abundance occurs long before PBH evaporation and only results in a negligible primordial charge asymmetry. PBH evaporation at later times then serves as a mechanism to resurrect the asymmetron abundance and ensure the successful generation of the baryon asymmetry after all. We conclude that PBHs can act as asymmetry-producing machines that grant access to whatever CP-violating physics may be present in the ultraviolet, rekindling it at lower energies where it can be reprocessed into a baryon asymmetry by right-handed neutrinos.

2023-11-02, **Search for an invisible muon philic scalar $X_{0}$ or vector $X_{1}$ via $J/ψ\toμ^+μ^-+\rm{invisible}$ decay at BESIII**, BESIII Collaboration et.al., [2311.01076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01076v1)

 A light scalar $X\_{0}$ or vector $X\_{1}$ particles have been introduced as a possible explanation for the $(g-2)\_{\mu}$ anomaly and dark matter phenomena.   Using $(8.998\pm 0.039)\times10^9$ $\jpsi $ events collected by the BESIII detector, we search for a light muon philic scalar $X\_{0}$ or vector $X\_{1}$ in the processes $J/\psi\to\mu^+\mu^- X\_{0,1}$ with $X\_{0,1}$ invisible decays. No obvious signal is found, and the upper limits on the coupling $g\_{0,1}'$ between the muon and the $X\_{0,1}$ particles are set to be between $1.1\times10^{-3}$ and $1.0\times10^{-2}$ for the $X\_{0,1}$ mass in the range of $1<M(X\_{0,1})<1000$~MeV$/c^2$ at 90$\%$ confidence level.

2023-11-02, **Cosmological foundations revisited with Pantheon+**, Zachary G. Lane et.al., [2311.01438v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01438v1)

 We reanalyse the Pantheon+ supernova catalogue to compare a cosmology with non-FLRW evolution, the "timescape cosmology", with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. To this end, we consider the Pantheon+ supernova catalogue, which is the largest available Type Ia supernova dataset for a geometric comparison between the two models. We construct a covariance matrix to be as independent of cosmology as possible, including independence from the FLRW geometry and peculiar velocity with respect to FLRW average evolution. Within this framework, which goes far beyond most other definitions of "model independence", we introduce new statistics to refine Type Ia supernova (SneIa) light-curve analysis. In addition to conventional galaxy correlation functions used to define the scale of statistical homogeneity we introduce empirical statistics which enables a refined analysis of the distribution biases of SneIa light-curve parameters $\beta c$ and $\alpha x\_1$.   For lower redshifts, the Bayesian analysis highlights important features attributable to the increased number of low-redshift supernovae, the artefacts of model-dependent light-curve fitting and the cosmic structure through which we observe supernovae. This indicates the need for cosmology-independent data reduction to conduct a stronger investigation of the emergence of statistical homogeneity and to compare alternative cosmologies in light of recent challenges to the standard model.   "Dark energy" is generally invoked as a place-holder for "new physics". Our from-first-principles reanalysis of the Pantheon+ catalogue supports future deeper studies of the interplay of matter and nonlinear spacetime geometry, in a data-driven setting. For the first time in 25 years, we find evidence that the Pantheon+ catalogue already contains such a wealth of data that with further reanalysis, a genuine "paradigm shift" may soon emerge.

2023-11-02, **TIC 378898110: A Bright, Short-Period AM CVn Binary in TESS**, Matthew J. Green et.al., [2311.01255v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01255v1)

 AM CVn-type systems are ultracompact, helium-accreting binary systems which are evolutionarily linked to the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae and are expected to be strong Galactic sources of gravitational waves detectable to upcoming space-based interferometers. AM CVn binaries with orbital periods $\lesssim$ 20--23 min exist in a constant high state with a permanently ionised accretion disc. We present the discovery of TIC 378898110, a bright ($G=14.3$ mag), nearby ($309.3 \pm 1.8$ pc), high-state AM CVn binary discovered in TESS two-minute-cadence photometry. At optical wavelengths this is the third-brightest AM CVn binary known. The photometry of the system shows a 23.07172(6) min periodicity, which is likely to be the `superhump' period and implies an orbital period in the range 22--23 min. There is no detectable spectroscopic variability. The system underwent an unusual, year-long brightening event during which the dominant photometric period changed to a shorter period (constrained to $20.5 \pm 2.0$ min), which we suggest may be evidence for the onset of disc-edge eclipses. The estimated mass transfer rate, $\log (\dot{M} / \mathrm{M\_\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}) = -6.8 \pm 1.0$, is unusually high and may suggest a high-mass or thermally inflated donor. The binary is detected as an X-ray source, with a flux of $9.2 ^{+4.2}\_{-1.8} \times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 0.3--10 keV range. TIC 378898110 is the shortest-period binary system discovered with TESS, and its large predicted gravitational-wave amplitude makes it a compelling verification binary for future space-based gravitational wave detectors.

2023-11-02, **The TYPHOON stellar population synthesis survey: I. The young stellar population of the Great Barred Spiral NGC 1365**, Eva Sextl et.al., [2311.01140v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01140v1)

 We analyze TYPHOON long slit absorption line spectra of the starburst barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 obtained with the Progressive Integral Step Method covering an area of 15 square kpc. Applying a population synthesis technique, we determine the spatial distribution of ages and metallicity of the young and old stellar population together with star formation rates, reddening, extinction and the ratio R$\_V$ of extinction to reddening. We detect a clear indication of inside-out growth of the stellar disk beyond 3 kpc characterized by an outward increasing luminosity fraction of the young stellar population, a decreasing average age and a history of mass growth, which was finished 2 Gyrs later in the outermost disk. The metallicity of the young stellar population is clearly super solar but decreases towards larger galactocentric radii with a gradient of -0.02 dex/kpc. On the other hand, the metal content of the old population does not show a gradient and stays constant at a level roughly 0.4 dex lower than that of the young population. In the center of NGC 1365 we find a confined region where the metallicity of the young population drops dramatically and becomes lower than that of the old population. We attribute this to infall of metal poor gas and, additionally, to interrupted chemical evolution where star formation is stopped by AGN and supernova feedback and then after several Gyrs resumes with gas ejected by stellar winds from earlier generations of stars. We provide a simple model calculation as support for the latter.
