2025-02-13, **$B\to K\sf{+}invisible$, dark matter, and $CP$ violation in hyperon decays**, Xiao-Gang He et.al., [2502.09603v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09603v1)

 Recently the Belle II Collaboration has reported a measurement of the $B^+\to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ rate that is higher than the standard-model expectation. Since the emitted neutrinos are unobserved, the excess could be due to the $B^+$ decaying into a $K^+$ and a dark-matter pair. We entertain this possibility in a two-Higgs-doublet model supplemented with a real singlet scalar boson acting as the dark matter. This model also accommodates strangeness-changing interactions providing new sources of $CP$ violation which can affect hyperon and kaon nonleptonic transitions. We find that the resulting $CP$ violation in the hyperon sector can be significant, reaching the current empirical bounds, after taking into account constraints from kaon mixing and decay and from dark-matter relic-density data and direct searches including the Migdal effect. We demonstrate that the hyperon and kaon processes are complementary probes of this new-physics scenario. Its prediction for sizable hyperon $CP$ violation is potentially testable in ongoing experiments, such as BESIII, Belle II, and LHCb, and in next-generation ones like PANDA and at the Super Tau Charm Facility.

2025-02-13, **Ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation in neutrino sector**, Petr Satunin et.al., [2502.09548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09548v1)

 We discuss the constraints on superluminal neutrino Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) parameters from the observation of the ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A by KM3NeT collaboration in cases of linear $n=1$ and quadratic $n=2$ LIV scenarios. Assuming extragalactic origin of the event, we obtain the constraints on LIV mass scale $\Lambda\_{n=1} = 5.4 \times 10^{30}\, \mbox{GeV}$ and $\Lambda\_{n=2} = 3.5 \times 10^{19}\, \mbox{GeV}$ from the absence of neutrino splitting.

2025-02-13, **Cascaded Gamma-ray Emission Associated with the KM3NeT Ultra-High-Energy Event KM3-230213A**, Ke Fang et.al., [2502.09545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09545v1)

 A neutrino-like event with an energy of $\sim 220 \,{\rm PeV}$ was recently detected by the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope. If this neutrino comes from an astrophysical source, or from the interaction of an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray in the intergalactic medium, the ultra-high-energy gamma rays that are co-produced with the neutrinos will scatter with the extragalactic background light, producing an electromagnetic cascade and resulting in emission at GeV-to-TeV energies. In this paper, we compute the gamma-ray flux from this neutrino source considering various source distances and strengths of the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We find that the associated gamma-ray emission could be observed by existing imaging air cherenkov telescopes and air shower gamma-ray observatories, unless the strength of the IGMF is $B\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-13}$ G, or the ultra-high-energy gamma-rays are attenuated inside of the source itself. In the latter case, this source is expected to be radio-loud.

2025-02-13, **Neutrino Masses and Phenomenology in Nnaturalness**, Manuel Ettengruber et.al., [2502.09538v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09538v1)

 In this paper, it is shown that $N$naturalness scenarios have an intrinsic mechanism to suppress neutrino masses. As in other infrared neutrino mass models like extra-dimensional theories or many species theories, the large number of mixing partners is responsible for the neutrino mass suppression. It is shown how neutrino mass matrices arise in $N$naturalness models and the resulting neutrino mixing is analyzed. The first result is that a totally democratic coupling among the different sectors like in the original models is already ruled out by the fact that neutrinos are not massless. In the case where the sector couplings deviate from the intersector ones a tower of additional neutrino mass eigenstates appears whose difference between the squared masses, $\Delta m\_{ij}^2$, is determined fully by the theory. The resulting phenomenology of such a tower is investigated and the unique signals in neutrino oscillation experiments, neutrino mass measurements, and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are discussed. This opens the door for terrestrial tests of $N$naturalness whose phenomenology was so far focused on Cosmology.

2025-02-13, **Search for Heavy Neutral Leptons with IceCube DeepCore**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2502.09454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09454v1)

 The observation of neutrino oscillations has established that neutrinos have non-zero masses. This phenomenon is not explained by the Standard Model of particle physics, but one viable explanation to this dilemma involves the existence of heavy neutral leptons in the form of right-handed neutrinos. This work presents the first search for heavy neutral leptons with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The standard three flavor neutrino model is extended by adding a fourth GeV-scale mass state allowing mixing with the $\tau$ sector through the parameter $\|U\_{\tau4}\|^2$. The analysis is performed by searching for signatures of heavy neutral leptons that are directly produced via up-scattering of atmospheric $\nu\_\tau$'s inside the IceCube detection volume. Three heavy neutral lepton mass values, $m\_4$, of 0.3 GeV, 0.6 GeV, and 1.0 GeV are tested using ten years of data, collected between 2011 and 2021. No significant signal of heavy neutral leptons is observed for any of the tested masses. The resulting constraints for the mixing parameter are $\|U\_{\tau4}\|^2 < 0.19$ ($m\_4 = 0.3$ GeV), $\|U\_{\tau4}\|^2 < 0.36$ ($m\_4 = 0.6$ GeV), and $\|U\_{\tau4}\|^2 < 0.40$ ($m\_4 = 1.0$ GeV) at the 90% confidence level. This analysis serves as proof-of-concept for heavy neutral lepton searches in IceCube. The heavy neutral lepton event generator, developed in this work, and the analysis of the expected signatures lay the fundamental groundwork for future searches thereof.

2025-02-13, **Non-renormalizable grand unification utilizing the leptoquark mechanism of neutrino mass**, Çağlar Doğan et.al., [2502.09333v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09333v1)

 We analyze a non-supersymmetric, non-renormalizable grand unified theory whose particle content is that of the Georgi-Glashow model augmented only by scalars from the \textbf{10} and \textbf{35} representations. A prediction of our model is a color sextet, weak isodoublet whose mass lies at 1 TeV (10 TeV) and that does not couple to Standard Model fermions at tree level. The leptoquark mechanism through which Majorana neutrinos radiatively acquire their masses relates the neutrino mass matrix to that of the down-type quarks. A consequence of this relation and perturbativity of coupling constants is the upper bound of $2.5 \times 10^{15}$ GeV on the masses of the scalar leptoquarks $S\_1^*$ and ${\widetilde R}\_{2}$. Electroweak mixing of these leptoquarks induces a B-L violating decay of the proton which indirectly contrains the mass of ${\widetilde R}\_{2}$ to be greater than $2.1 \times 10^9$ GeV. We find the grand unification scale to exceed $1.4 \times 10^{16}$ GeV in all scenarios considered.

2025-02-13, **Emergent large flavor mixing from canonical and inverse seesaws?**, Zhi-zhong Xing et.al., [2502.09286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09286v1)

 While the canonical seesaw mechanism provides a most natural qualitative interpretation of tiny masses for the three active neutrinos, it offers no explanation for their large flavor mixing effects. The latter can be regarded as an emergent consequence of this mechanism, in which case we are left with an intriguing cross seesaw framework in the mass basis of all the six Majorana neutrinos. To lower the mass scales of heavy neutrinos, one is motivated to invoke the inverse seesaw mechanism but has to pay the price for a fine-tuned cancellation between its two sets of new degrees of freedom, in which case the largeness of active flavor mixing is an emergent phenomenon as well. A comparison between the approximate seesaw relations in the flavor basis and those exact ones in the mass basis is also made.

2025-02-13, **Spectral diversity in collisional neutrino-flavor conversion: flavor equipartition or swap**, Masamichi Zaizen et.al., [2502.09260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09260v1)

 Quantum kinetics of neutrinos are known to potentially change the classical neutrino radiation field in high-energy astrophysical sources such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. However, the mixing phenomena still have open issues in the nonlinear dynamics and the asymptotic states, particularly for recently discovered collision-induced flavor conversion. In this paper, we investigate linear and nonlinear dynamics of collisional neutrino-flavor conversion (CFC) with multi-energy neutrino gases through numerical simulations, demonstrating that the asymptotic states dramatically change depending on unstable modes dominating the system. In one unstable mode, high-energy neutrinos reach a flavor equipartition, but low-energy neutrinos return back to almost their initial states. In contrast, in the other one, rather low-energy neutrinos achieve a full flavor swap, but high-energy neutrinos undergo less flavor conversion. We clarify the distinct spectral behaviors in two different ways based on stability analysis and flavor pendulum. Our result suggests that CFC with flavor swap can become crucial at deeper radii with low electron fraction and requires more detailed theoretical modeling of neutrino quantum kinetics.

2025-02-13, **$ν$SpaceSim: An end-to-end simulation package to model the sensitivity of UHECR experiments to upward-moving extensive air showers sourced by cosmic neutrinos interacting in the Earth**, Jorge Caraça-Valente Barrera et.al., [2502.08890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08890v1)

 Neutrinos act as probes of hadronic processes and offer a distinctive view into their astrophysical origins at high energies. When reaching energies on the PeV scale, $\nu\_\tau$ interactions within the Earth can produce a significant flux of $\tau$-leptons. These $\tau$-leptons subsequently decay, generating upward-moving extensive air showers (EAS). Using the Earth as a target for neutrinos and the atmosphere as a signal generator effectively creates a detector with a mass $\gg$ gigaton. $\nu$SpaceSim is a comprehensive simulation developed to model all the relevant physical processes that describe the neutrino-induced, Earth-emergent lepton chain. The simulation models neutrino interactions inside the Earth that produce leptons, the propagation of the leptons through the Earth into the atmosphere, and their decay, forming composite EAS. Next, it models the generation of air optical Cherenkov and radio signals from these showers, including the propagation and attenuation of these signals through the atmosphere, accounting for effects such as clouds and the ionosphere. Finally, the simulation models the detector response according to the parameters defined by the user (such as altitude, effective area, frequency band...). Through this end-to-end simulation, $\nu$SpaceSim aims to help design the next generation of balloon- and space-based experiments, to estimate the exposure of ground-based experiments to these showers, and to understand the data from recent experiments such as EUSO-SPB2 and ANITA.

2025-02-13, **Multiple-cavities interferometric analysis for dark matter axions directional-sensitive search based on signal cross-correlation processing**, José Reina-Valero et.al., [2502.09580v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09580v1)

 Current axion detection limits neglect the relevance of the relative velocity between the axion field and the detectors. However, this aspect can lead to a daily modulation of the detected axion signal. In this work, we calculate the cross-correlation of various signals potentially originated in multiple-cavity setups, and we analyze how the signal-to-noise ratio and directional sensitivity depend on the signal cross-correlation among multiple cavities. The signal-to-noise ratio after cross-correlation exhibits a greater rate of increase over time compared to the power-summation technique, making it clear that this method could be potentially employed in a real setup for the reduction of the exposure time. For the study of the daily modulation, three interferometric experiments have been proposed in this manuscript: (i) three rectangular cavities in different Earth locations; (ii) three rectangular cavities located in the same Earth spot but oriented towards different perpendicular directions; (iii) six rectangular cavities in the same Earth location but oriented towards different directions. In each set-up, we have simulated three different cavity lengths. Similar results have been found for the cases (i) and (ii): when the highest length upon the three proposed is considered, a phase difference between the recorded voltages of more than $2^{\circ}$ has been obtained with our numerical calculations. We observe a daily modulation in the imaginary part of the signals cross-correlation for experiment (iii), that could be potentially used for the characterization of the axion velocity distribution. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first time that the cross-correlation technique has been applied to the directional sensitivity analysis of an array of haloscopes.

2025-02-13, **Cryogenic SiPMs for the Optical Readout of DarkSide-20k**, Giuseppe Matteucci et.al., [2502.09558v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09558v1)

 Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) have gained significant traction as an alternative technology to the well-established photomultiplier tube (PMT), with numerous high-sensitivity experiments adopting them either complementarily or as a replacement for PMTs. SiPMs are an ideal match for low-background cryogenic applications, such as massive noble liquid experiments for dark matter direct detection, due to (i) the significant reduction of dark noise in cold environments, (ii) relatively low radioactive content, and (iii) scalable industrial production. For these reasons, the Global Argon Dark Matter Collaboration has committed to this technology for DarkSide-20k, its next experiment for the direct search of WIMP Dark Matter, currently in construction at LNGS Hall C. The development of a large-area cryogenic SiPM-based photon counter has culminated in the Photon Detector Unit (PDU), a compact photosensor measuring $20\times20$ cm$^2$ with $100$ cm$^2$ active surface per channel, based on SiPM technology from Fondazione Bruno Kessler and incorporating custom front-end electronics suited for cryogenics. More than 600 PDUs are being produced and tested in various collaboration facilities to construct the two $~10.5$ m$^2$ optical planes of the massive two-phase argon time projection chamber of DarkSide-20k and the optical readout of its veto system.

2025-02-13, **Periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiations in black hole with dark matter halo**, Sumarna Haroon et.al., [2502.09171v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09171v1)

 This study investigates the gravitational dynamics of a spherically symmetric black hole embedded within a dark matter halo, focusing on the impact of the dark matter halo on time-like particle geodesics. We analyze key orbital parameters, including marginally bound orbits, innermost stable circular orbits, and periodic orbits, demonstrating how the dark matter halo alters their energy and angular momentum compared to an isolated black hole. Furthermore, we calculate the gravitational waveforms emitted by these periodic orbits, providing potential observational signatures for such systems. Our results demonstrate a clear correlation between the gravitational waveforms emitted by a small object orbiting a supermassive black hole and the object's zoom-whirl orbital behavior. Higher zoom numbers correspond to more complex waveform substructures. The presence of a dark matter halo significantly impacts these waveforms. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black holes and dark matter halos, offering insights into their complex gravitational interactions.

2025-02-13, **Searching for axion dark matter gegenschein of the Vela supernova remnant with FAST**, Wenxiu Yang et.al., [2502.08913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08913v1)

 Axions are one of the leading dark matter candidates. If we are embedded in a Milky Way dark matter halo comprised of axions, their stimulated decay would enable us to observe a counterimage (``axion gegenschein") with a frequency equal to half the axion mass in the opposite direction of a bright radio source. This spectral line emission will be broadened to $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim \sigma\_d/c \sim 10^{-3}$ due to the velocity dispersion of dark matter, $\sigma\_d$. In this pilot study, we perform the first search for the expected axion gegenschein image of Vela supernova remnant (SNR) with 26.4 hours of effective ON-OFF data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) L-band (1.0 - 1.5~GHz) 19-beam receiver. Our null detection limits the axion-photon coupling strength to be $g\_{a\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ in the mass ranges of $8.7\,\mu\mathrm{eV} \leq m\_a \leq 9.44\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ and $10.85\,\mu\mathrm{eV} \leq m\_a \leq 12.01\,\mu\mathrm{eV} $. These results provide a stronger constraint on $g\_{a\gamma\gamma}$ in this axion mass range than the current limits obtained by the direct search of axion decay signal from galaxy clusters which uses FAST observations, but is a factor of $\sim 3$ times weaker than the current CAST limit.Based on our observation strategy, data processing methods, and results, the expected sensitivity will reach $\sim 10^{-11}\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ with $\sim 2000$ hours of observation in the future.

2025-02-13, **The main jet axis of the W49B supernova remnant**, Noam Soker et.al., [2502.09543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09543v1)

 We identify an axis connecting two opposite `ears' in the supernova remnant W49B and morphological signatures of three arcs around this axis that we claim are sections of full circum-jet rings. Based on recent identifications of morphological signatures of jets in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), including ejecta-rich axes, we reexamine images of W49B and identify a heavy element-rich protrusion (ear) as a jet-inflated structure. We identify the opposite ear and a clump at its tip as the signature of the opposite jets. The line connecting the two clumps at the tips of the two opposite ears forms the main jet axis of W49B. We compare the three arcs around the main jet axis in W49B to the circum-jet rings of the jets in the Cygnus A galaxy and deduce that these arcs are sections of full circum-jet rings in W49B. In W49B, the jets are long gone, as in some planetary nebulae with circum-jet rings. Identifying the main jet axis is incompatible with a type Ia supernova. It leaves two possibilities: that jets exploded W49B as a CCSN, i.e., the jittering jets explosion mechanism where the pair of jets we identify is one of many that exploded the star, or that the explosion was a common envelope jet supernova with a thermonuclear outburst, i.e., both the pair of jets and thermonuclear outburst exploded the core of a red supergiant star as a pre-existing neutron star tidally destroyed it.

2025-02-13, **Accounting for motion of supernova host galaxy in statistical inference from SNIa data**, Ujjwal Upadhyay et.al., [2502.09258v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09258v1)

 We investigate the impact of peculiar motion of Type Ia supernova host galaxies on cosmological parameter estimation. This motion causes their redshift to deviate from that of the comoving observer at their position and is a source of noise. To this end, we develop an estimator for parameter estimation in models with errors in independent variables. Using the Bayesian framework, errors in independent variables are treated as nuisance parameters by making the independent variables parameters of the model. Our method applied to the Pantheon sample of Type Ia supernova indicates a few percent shift in the central values of inferred cosmological parameters. For the $w$CDM model, we find that accounting for peculiar velocities makes the data marginally more consistent with the cosmological constant model. By using simulated data, we show that not accounting for peculiar velocities will significantly impact parameter estimation from higher precision future data sets.

2025-02-13, **Pulsar scattering as a probe for structures in the interstellar medium**, Qiuyi He et.al., [2502.09158v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09158v1)

 Due to the inhomogeneity of electron number density, radio waves emitted by pulsars undergo scattering as they pass through the interstellar medium (ISM). However, a connection between large-scale pulsar scattering data and the structure of the Galactic ISM has yet to be established. In this paper, we explore the capability of pulsar scattering time data in discovering structures in the ISM. Using a large dataset of scattering time measurements for 473 pulsars, we fit the pulsar reduced scattering intensity as a function of Galactic latitude and distance, constructing a smooth model of the Galactic pulsar scattering distribution. By comparing this smooth distribution with observational data, we identify two ISM structures responsible for pulsar scattering, one is associated with the Vela supernova remnant region within the Gum Nebula, while the other is a newly discovered structure -- a distant superbubble, G38, located at a distance of 2.3 kpc with a size of ~50 pc. Analysis of the correlation coefficient of the pulsar scattering distribution shows that the correlation is dominated by structures smaller than 0.15 kpc -- the closest separation approachable by the current dataset. As measurements of the pulsar scattering time continue to increase in the future, they can potentially become an independent tool for exploring structures in the ISM.
