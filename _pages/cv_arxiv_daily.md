2024-01-17, **AT2021lwx: Another Neutrino-Coincident Tidal Disruption Event with a Strong Dust Echo?**, Chengchao Yuan et.al., [2401.09320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09320v1)

 We discuss the possible association of an astrophysical neutrino (IC220405B) with the recently reported, extremely energetic tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT2021lwx (ZTF20abrbeie, aka ``Scary Barbie'') at redshift $z=0.995$. Although the TDE is about $2.6^\circ$ off the direction of the reconstructed neutrino event (${outside}$ the 90% C.L. localization region), the TDE candidate shares some important characteristics with so far reported neutrino-TDE associations: a strong infrared dust echo, high bolometric luminosity, a neutrino time delay with respect to the peak mass accretion rate of the order of hundred days, and a high observed X-ray luminosity. We interpret this new association using an isotropic emission model, where neutrinos are produced by the collision of accelerated protons with infrared photons. After accounting for the high redshift of AT2021lwx (by interpreting the data in the SMBH frame), we find that the expected neutrino fluences and neutrino time delays are qualitatively comparable to the other TDEs. Since data are only available up to 300 days post-peak in the SMBH frame, significant uncertainties exist in the dust echo interpretation, and therefore in the predicted number of neutrinos detected, $\mathcal N\_{\nu}\simeq3.0\times10^{-3}-0.012$. We recommend further follow-up on this object for an extended period, and suggest refining the reconstruction the neutrino arrival direction in this particular case.

2024-01-17, **Numerical GR MHD simulations of the post-merger system with a composition-dependent equation of state**, Agnieszka Janiuk et.al., [2401.09035v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09035v1)

 By means of HARM\\_COOL\\_EOS, which is our code for conservative relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, we developed a new scheme for the simulation of a system formed after compact binary merger. Our code works with a tabulated equation of state of dense matter, accounts for the neutrino leakage, and follows the mass outflows via the tracer particle method. We discuss the numerical scheme, and present the recovery method included in our code. We also show results of a numerical simulation, addressed to the post-merger system after the coalescence of binary neutron stars, or a neutron star with a stellar mass black hole. The plasma is very neutron-rich, so the r-process nucleosynthesis in the ejected material may lead to unstable heavy isotopes creation. They are responsible for an electromagnetic signal, observed as a kilonova. In addition, the magnetized, neutrino-driven wind can act as a collimating mechanism for the relativistic jet.

2024-01-17, **The Influence of Stellar Rotation in Binary Systems on Core-Collapse Supernova Progenitors and Multi-messenger Signals**, Hao-Sheng Wang et.al., [2401.08985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08985v1)

 The detailed structure of core-collapse supernova progenitors is crucial for studying supernova explosion engines and the corresponding multimessenger signals. In this paper, we investigate the influence of stellar rotation on binary systems consisting of a 30 solar mass donor star and a 20 solar mass accretor using the MESA stellar evolution code. We find that through mass transfer in binary systems, fast-rotating red- and blue-supergiant progenitors can be formed within a certain range of initial orbital periods, albeit the correlation is not linear. We also find that even with the same initial mass ratio of the binary system, the resulting final masses of the collapsars, the iron core masses, the compactness parameters, and the final rotational rates can vary widely and are sensitive to the initial orbital periods. For instance, the progenitors with strong convection form a thinner Si-shell and a wider O-shell compared to those in single-star systems. In addition, we conduct two-dimensional self-consistent core-collapse supernova simulations with neutrino transport for these rotating progenitors derived from binary stellar evolution. We find that the neutrino and gravitational-wave signatures of these binary progenitors could exhibit significant variations. Progenitors with larger compactness parameters produce more massive proto-neutron stars, have higher mass-accretion rates, and emit brighter neutrino luminosity and louder gravitational emissions. Finally, we observe stellar-mass black hole formation in some of our failed exploding models.

2024-01-17, **Slaying Axion-Like Particles via Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes from Supercooled Phase Transition**, Angela Conaci et.al., [2401.09411v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09411v1)

 We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from density fluctuations due to supercooled phase transitions (PTs) triggered in an axion-like particle (ALP) model. We find that the mass of the PBHs is inversely correlated with the ALP decay constant $f\_a$. For instance, for $f\_a$ varying from ${\cal O}$(100 MeV) to ${\cal O}$($10^{12}$ GeV), the PBH mass varies between $(10^{3} - 10^{-24}) M\_{\odot}$. We then identify the ALP parameter space where the PBH can account for the entire (or partial) dark matter fraction of the Universe, in a single (multi-component) dark matter scenario, with the ALP being the other dark matter candidate. The PBH parameter space ruled out by current cosmological and microlensing observations can thus be directly mapped onto the ALP parameter space, thus providing new bounds on ALPs, complementary to the laboratory and astrophysical ALP constraints. Similarly, depending on the ALP couplings to other Standard Model particles, the ALP constraints on $f\_a$ can be translated into a lower bound on the PBH mass scale. Moreover, the supercooled PT leads to a potentially observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal at future GW observatories, such as aLIGO, LISA and ET, that acts as another complementary probe of the ALPs, as well as of the PBH dark matter. Finally, we show that the recent NANOGrav signal of stochastic GW in the nHz frequency range can be explained in our model with $f\_a\simeq (10~{\rm GeV}-1~{\rm TeV})$.

2024-01-17, **Were you born in an aborted primordial black hole?**, Emilie Despontin et.al., [2401.09408v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09408v1)

 We propose a novel mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis based on the standard model only and explaining the coincidence between the baryon and dark matter densities in the Universe, as well as the observed value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. In our scenario, large curvature fluctuations slightly below the threshold for Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation locally reheat the plasma above the sphaleron barrier when they collapse gravitationally but without forming a black hole. This rapid process can lead to a maximal baryogenesis in those regions at the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) epoch at thermal temperatures between 20 MeV and 50 MeV. Compared to another mechanism relying on shock waves associated to the formation of PBHs, our mechanism instead applies to aborted PBHs. Using simulations in numerical relativity, we calculate the overdensity threshold for baryogenesis and show that the baryon-to-photon ratio is generically between two and three times larger than the relative abundance of PBHs formed at those temperatures. Finally, we show that PBH formation models at the QCD epoch leading to an abundance comparable to the dark matter could have generated a baryon density and an averaged baryon-to-photon ratio consistent with observations.

2024-01-17, **On the geometry and quantum theory of regular and singular spinors**, G. Papadopoulos et.al., [2401.09254v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09254v1)

 We relate the Lounesto classification of regular and singular spinors to the orbits of the $Spin(3,1)$ group in the space of Dirac spinors. We find that regular spinors are associated with the principal orbits of the spin group while singular spinors are associated with special orbits whose isotropy group is $C$. We use this to clarify some aspects of the classical and quantum theory of spinors restricted to a class in this classification. In particular, we show that the degrees of freedom of an ELKO field, which has been proposed as a candidate for dark matter, can be reexpressed as a Dirac field preserving locality. We also propose an interacting Lagrangian which can consistently describe all 6 classes of regular and singular spinors.

2024-01-17, **Probing black holes in a dark matter spike of M87 using quasinormal mode**, Dong Liu et.al., [2401.09182v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09182v1)

 Dark matter density can be significantly enhanced by the supermassive black hole at the galactic center, leading to a structure called dark matter spike. Dark matter spike may change the spacetime properties of black holes that constitute deviations from GR black holes. Based on these interesting background, we construct a set of solutions of black holes in a dark matter spike under the Newtonian approximation and full relativity. Combining the mass model of M87, we study the quasinormal modes of black holes in the scalar field perturbation and compared the with Schwarzschild black hole. Besides, the impacts of dark matter on the quasinormal mode of black holes have been studied in depth. In particular, our results show that the impacts of dark matter spike on the quasinormal mode of black holes can reach up to $10^{-4}$. These new features from quasinormal mode of black holes under the Newtonian approximation and full relativity may provide some help for the establishment of the final dark matter model, and provide a new thought for the indirect detection of dark matter.

2024-01-17, **On the Possibility of Detecting a Global Signal in the Line of the Hyperfine Structure of Hydrogen from the Dark Ages**, Olexandr Konovalenko et.al., [2401.09096v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09096v1)

 We analyze the possibilities of detecting a signal in the hydrogen 21 cm line, which was formed in the early universe during the Dark Ages, using the Ukrainian radio telescopes UTR-2 and GURT of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. As a result of cosmological expansion, this line is shifted to the decameter range of wavelengths ($\lambda\_{obs}\approx18$ m, $\nu\_{obs}\approx16$ MHz) and is in the band of operating frequencies of these telescopes. The brightness temperature of the predicted sky-averaged global signal ranges from $\sim-0.08$ to $\sim0.02$ K, depending on the cosmological model. Such a weak signal is a big challenge even for the world's largest radio telescope in the decameter wavelength range UTR-2, since the signal level of the synchrotron radiation of the Galaxy at these frequencies is 20,000-40,000 K. The paper highlights the peculiarities of spectroscopy at decameter waves, interfering factors of natural and instrumental origin and ways to eliminate them in order to reliably detect the signal in the 21 cm line, which can become an important source of information both about the environment in which the first stars and galaxies were born, and about the nature of dark matter particles and the magnitude of primordial magnetic fields. It was concluded that the detection of such a signal using the most sensitive radio telescopes of the decameter wavelength range is quite possible (with a frequency accumulation of 25 MHz, the detection time will be ~50 days) and can be implemented in the coming years of peace in Ukraine.

2024-01-17, **Signal in the Hyperfine Structure Line of the Ground State of Atomic Hydrogen from the Dark Ages as a Cosmological Test**, Bohdan Novosyadlyj et.al., [2401.09095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09095v1)

 We analyze the formation of the redshifted hyperfine structure line 21-cm of hydrogen atoms in Dark Ages at $30\le z\le300$ in the different cosmologies. To study its dependence on the values of cosmological parameters and physical conditions in the intergalactic medium, the evolution of the global (sky-averaged) differential brightness temperature in this line was computed in standard and non-standard cosmological models with different parameters. The standard $\Lambda$CDM model with post-Planck parameters predicts a value of the differential brightness temperature in the center of the absorption line $\delta T\_{br}\approx35$ mK at $z\approx87$. The frequency of the line in the absorption maximum is 16 MHz, the effective half-width of the line is 17 MHz. The depth of line is moderately sensitive to $\Omega\_b$ and $H\_0$, weakly sensitive to $\Omega\_{dm}$, and insensitive to other parameters of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. But line is very sensitive to the additional mechanisms of heating or cooling of baryonic matter during the Dark Ages, so it can be a good test of non-standard cosmological models. In the models with decaying and self-annihilating dark matter, as well as with a primordial stochastic magnetic field, the temperature of baryonic matter in this period is higher if the larger is the fraction of these energy components of dark matter and magnetic field strength. The absorption line becomes shallower, desappers and transitions to emission at values of the component parameters lower than the upper limits on them following from the current observational data. Estimates show that such spectral features may be detected by radio telescopes in the decameter wavelength range in the near future.

2024-01-17, **The Dark Dimension, the Swampland, and the Dark Matter Fraction Composed of Primordial Near-Extremal Black Holes**, Luis A. Anchordoqui et.al., [2401.09087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09087v1)

 In a recent publication we studied the decay rate of primordial black holes perceiving the dark dimension, an innovative five-dimensional (5D) scenario that has a compact space with characteristic length-scale in the micron range. We demonstrated that the rate of Hawking radiation of 5D black holes slows down compared to 4D black holes of the same mass. Armed with our findings we showed that for a species scale of ${\cal O} (10^{9}~{\rm GeV})$, an all-dark-matter interpretation in terms of primordial black holes should be feasible for black hole masses in the range $10^{14} \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$. As a natural outgrowth of our recent study, herein we calculate the Hawking evaporation of near-extremal 5D black holes. Using generic entropy arguments we demonstrate that Hawking evaporation of higher-dimensional near-extremal black holes proceeds at a slower rate than the corresponding Schwarzschild black holes of the same mass. Assisted by this result we show that if there were 5D primordial near-extremal black holes in nature, then a PBH all-dark-matter interpretation would be possible in the mass range $10^{7}\sqrt{\beta} \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$, where $\beta$ is a parameter that controls the difference between mass and charge of the associated near-extremal black hole.

2024-01-17, **Dark Matter searches with photons at the LHC**, Subhojit Roy et.al., [2401.08917v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08917v1)

 We unveil blind spot regions in dark matter (DM) direct detection (DMDD), for weakly interacting massive particles with a mass around a few hundred~GeV that may reveal interesting photon signals at the LHC. We explore a scenario where the DM primarily originates from the singlet sector within the $Z\_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). A novel DMDD spin-independent blind spot condition is revealed for singlino-dominated DM, in cases where the mass parameters of the higgsino and the singlino-dominated lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) exhibit opposite relative signs (i.e., $\kappa < 0$), emphasizing the role of nearby bino and higgsino-like states in tempering the singlino-dominated LSP. Additionally, proximate bino and/or higgsino states can act as co-annihilation partner(s) for singlino-dominated DM, ensuring agreement with the observed relic abundance of DM. Remarkably, in scenarios involving singlino-higgsino co-annihilation, higgsino-like neutralinos can distinctly favor radiative decay modes into the singlino-dominated LSP and a photon, as opposed to decays into leptons/hadrons. In exploring this region of parameter space within the singlino-higgsino compressed scenario, we study the signal associated with at least one relatively soft photon alongside a lepton, accompanied by substantial missing transverse energy and a hard initial state radiation jet at the LHC. In the context of singlino-bino co-annihilation, the bino state, as the next-to-LSP, exhibits significant radiative decay into a soft photon and the LSP, enabling the possible exploration at the LHC through the triggering of this soft photon alongside large missing transverse energy and relatively hard leptons/jets resulting from the decay of heavier higgsino-like states.
