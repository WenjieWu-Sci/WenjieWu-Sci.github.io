2025-08-25, **Measurement of the branching ratio of $\mathrm{^{16}N}$, $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$, and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$ isotopes through the nuclear muon capture reaction in the Super-Kamiokande detector**, Y. Maekawa et.al., [2508.18110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18110v1)

 The Super-Kamiokande detector has measured solar neutrinos for more than $25$ years. The sensitivity for solar neutrino measurement is limited by the uncertainties of energy scale and background modeling. Decays of unstable isotopes with relatively long half-lives through nuclear muon capture, such as $\mathrm{^{16}N}$, $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$ and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$, are detected as background events for solar neutrino observations. In this study, we developed a method to form a pair of stopping muon and decay candidate events and evaluated the production rates of such unstable isotopes. We then measured their branching ratios considering both their production rates and the estimated number of nuclear muon capture processes as $Br(\mathrm{^{16}N})=(9.0 \pm 0.1)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{15}C})=(0.6\pm0.1)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{12}B})=(0.98 \pm 0.18)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{13}B})=(0.14 \pm 0.12)\%$, respectively. The result for $\mathrm{^{16}N}$ has world-leading precision at present and the results for $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$, and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$ are the first branching ratio measurements for those isotopes.

2025-08-25, **Searching non-standard interactions with atmospheric neutrinos at ESSnuSB**, ESSnuSB et.al., [2508.18103v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18103v1)

 Atmospheric neutrinos provide a unique avenue to study neutrino interactions in matter. In this work, the prospects of constraining non-standard neutrino interactions with atmospheric neutrino oscillations are investigated for the proposed ESSnuSB far detector. By analyzing atmospheric neutrino samples equivalent to 5.4 Mt$\cdot$year exposure, it is found that ESSnuSB could be able to set the upper bounds $\|\epsilon\_{e\mu}^m\| < 0.053, \|\epsilon\_{e\tau}^m\| < 0.057, \|\epsilon\_{\mu\tau}^m\| < 0.021, \epsilon\_{ee}^m - \epsilon\_{\mu\mu}^m < 0.075$ and $\|\epsilon\_{\tau\tau}^m - \epsilon\_{\mu\mu}^m\| < 0.031$ at $90\%$ CL, when the results are minimized for $\phi\_{e\mu}^m, \phi\_{e\tau}^m$ and $\phi\_{\mu\tau}^m$ and normal ordering is assumed for neutrino masses. It is also shown that the presence of non-standard interactions could affect the sensitivities to neutrino mass ordering and $\theta\_{23}^{}$ octant in comparison to the standard interaction scheme. The results of this work highlight the complementarity between atmospheric and accelerator neutrino programs in ESSnuSB.

2025-08-25, **Forward neutrino production and event rates at the Future Circular Collider for hadron collisions**, B. R. Ko et.al., [2508.18087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18087v1)

 A proposed future ultra high energy collider such as the Future Circular Collider produces intense and collimated neutrinos from weak decays of hadrons. We have estimated the production yields of such neutrinos from proton-proton collisions whose center-of-mass energy is 100~TeV and integrated luminosity of 1~ab$^{-1}$. Using a hypothetical detector positioned either 0.5~km or 2~km downstream of the proton-proton interaction point along the beamline, we have discussed the expected charged current neutrino scattering event rates and their possible extension up to the neutrino energy of about 50~TeV. We have also addressed a feasibility to observe so-far-unmeasured direct $W^{\pm}$ boson production from the interactions of neutrinos with nucleus.

2025-08-25, **Rotational Effects on Neutrino Emission in Core-collapse Supernovae**, Michael A. Pajkos et.al., [2508.17633v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17633v1)

 All stars rotate. While magnetic braking slows massive stars, the effect a stellar companion has on stellar rotation is still being explored. To prepare for future observations from rotating core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), we analyze a set of 30 2D neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic CCSN simulations for a variety of compactness values, rotation rates, and equations of state. We systematically explore how rotation lowers expected neutrino counts and energies for a realistic detector, while accounting for adiabatic Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein matter effects. We quantify the effect of viewing angle for neutrino emission for multiple rotation rates. Using 'multimessenger synthesis', we develop a technique that correlates multimessengers to constrain the neutrino mass ordering for a future supernova event. Likewise, we develop a method to constrain the distance to a rotating or nonrotating CCSN, regardless of explosion outcome.

2025-08-24, **Role of cosmic voids and their matter properties in shaping wormhole geometry in generalized geometry-matter coupling gravity**, A. Errehymy et.al., [2508.17492v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17492v1)

 Cosmic voids are increasingly recognized as a promising tool for cosmological exploration. Their distribution and density profiles are highly responsive to alterations in gravitational theories, along with the influences of dark energy and neutrinos. Investigating voids offers a compelling opportunity to uncover signatures of alternative gravity models on a cosmological level. Voids span a notable range of density contrasts, from approximately -$1$ near their centers to around $0$ at their edges, where screening mechanisms become less effective. The primary objective of this study is to explore a novel model that introduces a new category of wormhole solutions by leveraging cosmic voids$-$vast underdense regions of the universe$-$for the first time. We focus on identifying new exact static wormhole models by proposing an alternative viewpoint on their matter content, rooted in the recently formulated $f(R,\mathcal{L}\_m,T)$ theory of gravity. By developing a unique solution based on a universal density profile for voids, we examine crucial constraints on the parameters that dictate matter distribution and the structure of spacetime itself. Our results reveal how these cosmic voids significantly influence the geometry of wormholes, steepening the gradient toward the throat and mitigating violations of the null and weak energy conditions, particularly beyond their centers. We also highlight intriguing gravitational lensing effects, showing that this wormhole repels light rather than capturing it, creating a fascinating interaction between gravity and light.

2025-08-24, **Enhancing the sensitivity of neutrinoless double beta decays via combined multi-transition analysis**, C. R. Ding et.al., [2508.17413v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17413v1)

 Next-generation neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments, with projected half-life sensitivities approaching $10^{28}$ years, aim to fully probe the parameter space associated with the inverted neutrino mass ordering. However, this discovery potential remains uncertain, as it depends sensitively on the nuclear matrix element, which exhibits significant model dependence. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to enhance experimental sensitivity by performing a combined analysis of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay to both the ground state and the first excited $0^+$ state of the daughter nucleus. This approach is particularly promising for large liquid xenon detectors, such as the proposed PandaX-xT and XLZD experiments, which are capable of identifying decays of $^{136}$Xe to excited states with high efficiency. Our analysis demonstrates that such a combined multi-transition analysis can improve the sensitivity to $\|m\_{\beta\beta}\|$ by more than a factor of two for a nominal xenon detector setup, and by up to an order of magnitude in an ideal scenario, potentially accelerating access to the entire inverted ordering regime. These findings underscore the importance of probing multiple decay channels simultaneously in future $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay searches to maximize discovery potential.

2025-08-24, **Gravitational Instability and Fragmentation in Collapsar Disks Supports the Formation of Sub-Solar Neutron Stars**, Yi-Xian Chen et.al., [2508.17183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17183v1)

 We perform three-dimensional shearing-box hydrodynamical simulations to explore the outcome of gravitational instability in the outer regions of neutrino-cooled disks such as those formed from the collapse of rotating massive stars ("collapsars''). We employ a physical equation of state, optically-thin neutrino cooling, and assume an electron fraction set by the balance of electron/positron pair-capture reactions. Disks in a marginally stable initial state (Toomre parameter Q~ 1) undergo runaway cooling and fragmentation when the dimensionless cooling timescale obeys tau\_cool = t\_cool*Omega < 10, where Omega is the orbital frequency; these conditions correspond to accretion rates > Msun/s on the upper end of those achieved by collapsar progenitor stars. Fragmentation leads to the formation of neutron-rich clumps (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.1) spanning a range of masses ~0.01-1 Msun around the local Jeans value. Most clumps exceed the local Chandrasekhar mass M\_Ch ~ Ye^2 and hence will continue to collapse to nuclear densities, forming neutron stars (NS) with sub-solar masses otherwise challenging to create through ordinary stellar core-collapse. Even cool disks dominated by alpha-particles (Ye ~ 0.5) can fragment and collapse into neutron-rich clumps capable of forming sub-solar NSs. Although our simulations cannot follow this process directly, if the disk-formed NSs subsequently pair into binaries, the gravitational wave chirps from their rapid mergers are potentially detectable by ground based observatories. The temporal coincidence of such a hierarchical NS merger chain with the collapsar gamma-ray burst and supernova would offer a uniquely spectacular multi-messenger "symphony''.

 Axions are hypothetical particles that provide a compelling solution to two major mysteries in modern physics: the strong CP problem and the nature of dark matter. The plasma haloscope has been proposed as a promising approach for probing the higher-mass regime for dark matter axions by employing a periodic arrangement of conducting wires. In this study, we present a novel tuning mechanism for such wire-based structures by bundling the wires into a spiral configuration. This design enables continuous frequency tuning of approximately 25% with a single central rotation while maintaining the form factor. To validate this concept, we fabricated a prototype cavity comprising six spiral arms and experimentally demonstrated its feasibility, achieving results in good agreement with numerical simulations.

2025-08-25, **Timing Mass of the Local Group**, Louis E. Strigari et.al., [2508.18061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18061v1)

 The classic model of the Local Group (LG) is that of two dominant constituents, the Milky Way and M31, first separating and then detaching from the Hubble flow, leading to a nearly radial approaching orbit. This simple model has been confronted by new measurements of the 3D M31 kinematics, by cosmological simulations, and by theoretical understanding of the impact of massive substructures such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. This article explores the consequences of new observations and theory on the determination of the mass and dynamics of the LG. The M31 tangential velocity measurement and contribution from the cosmological constant both increase the implied timing mass of the LG to be $\sim 5 \times 10^{12}$ M$\_\odot$. Timing mass estimates for the LG tend to be larger than the sum of the Milky Way and M31 halo masses, and larger than independent LG mass estimators. Precision future kinematics have the potential to explore the origin of this difference, shed light on dark matter in the LG, the origin of its angular momentum, and possibly even local values of cosmological parameters.

2025-08-25, **Investigating Optical and Ring-Down Gravitational Wave Properties of a Rotating Black Hole in a Dehnen Galactic Dark Matter Halo**, Mrinnoy M. Gohain et.al., [2508.18053v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18053v1)

 We present a comprehensive study of the optical and dynamical properties of a rotating black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,0)$ galactic dark matter halo, modeled by a double power-law density profile commonly used to describe realistic galactic cores. By extending our previous Schwarzschild-Dehnen solution using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct a Kerr-like axisymmetric spacetime that smoothly incorporates both black hole rotation and the influence of the surrounding dark matter halo. We systematically investigate the effects of the halo parameters-the central density and halo radius-on horizon structure, the shape and extent of the ergoregion, and the null geodesics associated with black hole shadows. Our results show that the presence of a dense or extended halo expands the event horizon and ergoregion, and significantly alters the size and distortion of the black hole shadow. Furthermore, by applying the WKB approximation to scalar field perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and demonstrate that the frequencies and damping times of ringdown signals are highly sensitive to the halo profile. These results open promising avenues for probing the dark matter environment of astrophysical black holes through black hole imaging and gravitational wave observations.

2025-08-25, **Dark Degeneracy in DESI DR2: Interacting or Evolving Dark Energy?**, Vitor Petri et.al., [2508.17955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17955v1)

 The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, despite its success, is challenged by persistent observational tensions in the Hubble constant ($H\_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($S\_8$), motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios. We investigate a dark energy model with a phenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly degenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical expansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by cosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent datasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide significantly better fits to the data than $\Lambda$CDM. Although indistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a distinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark sector interaction at $z \approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in the CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered more physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The resulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S\_8$, potentially alleviating the weak-lensing $S\_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a sharp suppression of the growth rate $f\sigma\_8(z)$ at $z \lesssim 0.8$, which is in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates that the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the observed growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.

2025-08-24, **Weak Lensing Approximation of Wave-optics Effects from General Symmetric Lens Profiles**, Zhao-Feng Wu et.al., [2508.17486v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17486v1)

 Gravitational lensing of electromagnetic (EM) waves has yielded many profound discoveries across fundamental physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Similar to EM waves, gravitational waves (GWs) can also be lensed. When their wavelength is comparable to the characteristic scale of the lens, wave-optics (WO) effects manifest as frequency-dependent modulations in the GW waveform. These WO features encode valuable information about the lensing system but are challenging to model, especially in the weak lensing regime, which has a larger optical depth than strong lensing. We present a novel and efficient framework to accurately approximate WO effects induced by general symmetric lens profiles. Our method is validated against numerical calculations and recovers the expected asymptotic behavior in both high- and low-frequency limits. Accurate and efficient modeling of WO effects in the weak lensing regime will enable improved lens reconstruction, delensing of standard sirens, and provide a unique probe to the properties of low-mass halos with minimal baryonic content, offering new insights into the nature of dark matter.

2025-08-24, **Probing Leptophobic Dark Sectors via Gravitational Wave Signatures**, Taramati et.al., [2508.17476v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17476v1)

 We study a minimally extended version of the Standard Model where baryon number is gauged with a $U(1)\_B$ symmetry. This model can be made anomaly-free by adding a set of additional fermions. The lightest component of these fermions behaves as a viable dark matter candidate. We show that the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)\_B$ symmetry can produce gravitational waves via bubble dynamics resulting from a first-order phase transition, which can be detected in future gravitational wave experiments like LISA and ET. Such gravitational wave signatures can be used as a probe to constrain the model in future observations and complement dark matter and collider searches. We perform a random numerical scan of the parameter space and derive the viable region consistent with current bounds from dark matter experiments such as LUX-ZEPLIN and XENONnT and sensitive to future gravitational wave experiments. We find that dark matter with mass of order $\mathcal{O}(1 - 10)$ TeV is the most interesting to test in future gravitational wave as well as laboratory experiments. In the viable parameter space, the mass of the $Z'$ gauge boson associated with the $U(1)\_B$ lies in the few-tens of TeV region, and the mass of the scalar associated with the symmetry breaking lies around a few hundred GeV to TeV scale. Hence, the dark matter and mediator mass scales typically fall beyond the reach of present direct detection experiments and are marginally accessible at current collider energies.

2025-08-24, **Dynamical Tension Strings with Target Scale Symmetry producing DE, DM and why 4D?**, Eduardo Guendelman et.al., [2508.17333v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17333v1)

 In the modified measure formulation string or branes the tension appear as an additional dynamical degree of freedom . Furthermore in the presence of an additional background scalar field that couples to the strings and locally changes the tension, the tension field really dynamical and the theory has an intrinsic target space scale symmetry. When many types of strings probing the same region of space are considered this tension scalar is constrained by the requirement of quantum conformal invariance. For the case of two types of strings probing the same region of space with different dynamically generated tensions, there are two different metrics, associated to the different strings. Each of these metrics have to satisfy vacuum Einsteins equations and the consistency of these two Einsteins equations determine the tension scalar. The universal metric, common to both strings generically does not satisfy Einsteins equation . We review a case where two string dependent metrics considered here are flat space in Minkowski space and Minkowski space after a special conformal transformation and leads to a well defined brane world solution. We review how the model avoid swampland constraints making treatments for Dark energy and inflation more realistic and how strings with a different tension appear as Dark Matter to us. Since the Dark strings and since the visible strings share the space time, including the same compactification, and since the compactification determines the particle content, we argue that the dark strings lead to Dark copies of the standard model. An argument that many copies will lead to 4D effective spacetime as a consequence of a target space scale symmetry restoration.

2025-08-24, **A Unified Lagrangian Framework for Galaxy Clustering: Consistent Modeling of Bias, Redshift-Space Distortions, and Reconstruction**, Naonori Sugiyama et.al., [2508.17331v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17331v1)

 We present \emph{Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory} (ULPT), a perturbative framework for consistently modeling galaxy density fluctuations across real space, redshift space, and post-reconstruction fields. Unlike existing approaches that treat these cases separately, ULPT provides a single theoretical structure that incorporates the three essential coordinate mappings: the Lagrangian-to-Eulerian transformation, the real-to-redshift mapping induced by peculiar velocities, and the remapping from pre to post reconstruction. A key feature of our formulation is the explicit decomposition of the density field into two physically distinct components: the \emph{Jacobian deviation}, which encodes intrinsic linear and nonlinear growth, and the \emph{displacement-mapping effect}, which captures large-scale convective distortions. This separation enables a fully analytic and infrared (IR)-safe resummation, ensuring exact IR cancellation, a consistent Gaussian description of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping, and the correct residual structure in cross spectra between fields with distinct IR behavior. The perturbative expansion of ULPT naturally generates Galileon-type operators, thereby providing a compact and physically motivated operator basis for nonlinear and nonlocal Lagrangian bias, and allowing for a renormalization-free treatment of biased tracers. Within this framework, we derive a unified expression for the power spectrum that applies equally to dark matter, biased tracers, redshift-space distortions, and reconstructed fields. ULPT thus offers a robust and extensible foundation for precision modeling of large-scale structure, with potential extensions to higher-order statistics, such as the bispectrum, and to other two-point observables, such as galaxy--galaxy lensing.

2025-08-24, **Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories**, Shinji Tsujikawa et.al., [2508.17231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17231v1)

 DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w\_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w\_{\rm DE} < -1$ to $w\_{\rm DE} > -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without introducing theoretical pathologies. In Horndeski theories, however, breaking the shift symmetry allows this transition. We present an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a higher-order derivative term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts while avoiding ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.

2025-08-25, **Far-Infrared Emission from a Late Supernova Remnant in an Inhomogeneous Medium**, S. A. Drozdov et.al., [2508.18215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18215v1)

 The interstellar dust grains are swept up during the expansion of the supernova (SN) remnant, they penetrate behind the shock front, where they are heated and destroyed in the hot gas. This leads to a change in emissivity of such grains. In this work, we consider the evolution of the infrared (IR) luminosity of the SN remnant expanding into an inhomogeneous interstellar medium with lognormal distribution of the density fluctuations. The IR luminosity of the swept-up interstellar dust rapidly increases during the first several thousand years after the SN explosion, and reaches the maximum value. Afterwards, it decreases due to the destruction of the dust grains in hot gas and their declining emissivity in the cooling down gas of the shell. We show how the IR luminosity of dust in the SN remnant depends on the dispersion of the gas density in front of the SN shock front. We find that for the significant period of time (40 - 50 kyr) the maximum of the dust IR luminosity peaks at the range centered at 70$\mu$m. Therefore, this band can be considered as the most optimal range for studying the late SN remnants. We illustrate that during evolution, the dust temperature changes from 70 to 20 K, and only slightly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. In the radiative phase, the strong emission lines of metal ions emerge above the dust continuum. Their luminosity rapidly increases and exceeds the dust continuum luminosity by $\sim 10-10^3$ times. The point in time when the high luminosity in the lines is reached strongly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. We discuss possibilities for detection of the IR emission both in dust continuum and in lines. We expect that their ratios will allow to estimate the inhomogeneity of the medium, where the remnant is expanding.

2025-08-25, **The Impact of Axion-Like Particles on Late Stellar Evolution From Intermediate-Mass Stars to core-collapse Supernova Progenitors**, Inmacolata Domínguez et.al., [2508.17779v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17779v1)

 Context. Stars with masses ranging from 3 to 11 M\_\odot exhibit multiple evolutionary paths. Less massive stars in this range conclude their evolution as carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. However, those that achieve carbon ignition before the pressure by degenerate electron halts the core contraction may either form massive CONe/ONe white dwarfs, or undergo an electron-capture supernova, or photo-disintegrate neon and proceed with further thermonuclear burning, ultimately leading to the formation of a gravitationally unstable iron core. Aims. An evaluation of the impact of the energy loss caused by the production of axion-like-particles (ALPs) on evolution and final destiny of these stars is the main objective of this paper. Methods. We compute various sets of stellar models, all with solar initial composition, varying the strengths of the ALP coupling with photons and electrons. Results. As a consequence of an ALP thermal production, the critical masses for off-center C and Ne ignitions are both shifted upward. When the current bounds for the ALP coupling strengths are assumed, the maximum mass for CO WD progenitors is about 1.1 M\_\odot heavier than that obtained without the ALP energy loss, while the minimum mass for a core collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitor is 0.7 M\_\odot higher. Conclusions. Current constraints from observed Type II-P supernova light curves and pre-explosive luminosity do not exclude an ALP production within the current bounds. However, the maximum age of CCSN progenitors, as deduced from the star formation rate of the parent stellar population, would require a smaller minimum mass. This discrepancy can be explained by assuming a moderate extra mixing (as due to core overshooting or rotational induced mixing) above the fully convective core that develops during the main sequence.

2025-08-25, **The Near-Infrared Echo from SN 2023xgo: Evidence for a Massive Pre-Supernova Eruption in a Type Ibn/Icn Supernova**, Masayuki Yamanaka et.al., [2508.17582v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17582v1)

 We present near-infrared (NIR) and optical observations and analysis of the Type Ibn/Icn supernova (SN) 2023xgo, spanning the period from two days to 100 days past explosion. A comparison of the NIR light curves and color evolution with those of other Type Ibn SNe reveals prominent NIR excess persisting from 15 to 100 days. The spectral energy distribution (SED) is well explained by a combination of a hot blackbody component and a carbon dust model. The dust temperature remained relatively constant at $T=1600\pm100$ K up to $t=60$ d. The estimated dust mass is $\sim1.2 \times10^{-4}~M\_{\odot}$. Based on the SN emission of $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak luminosity, the evaporation radius is estimated to be $1.2\times10^{16}$ cm, consistent with the expectation from light travel time. The dust shell is located outside the shocked cool dense shell (CDS) at the position of $7.6\times10^{14}$ cm. It suggests that the observed NIR excess originates from pre-existing circumstellar (CS) dust. Considering a typical dust-to-gas mass ratio, the CS gas mass is estimated to be $\simeq10^{-2}~M\_{\odot}$, implying a high mass-loss rate of $\sim0.1~M\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ from either a low-mass helium star progenitor with a binary interaction, or may be a massive Wolf-Rayet star that experienced a significant eruption.
