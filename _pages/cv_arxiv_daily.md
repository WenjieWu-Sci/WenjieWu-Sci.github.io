2023-06-08, **Towards distinguishing Dirac from Majorana neutrino mass with gravitational waves**, Stephen F. King et.al., [2306.05389v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05389v1)

 We propose to distinguish the nature of neutrino masses, Dirac vs Majorana, from the spectrum of gravitational waves generated. We study two simple models of Majorana and Dirac mass genesis motivated by generating small neutrino masses without assuming tiny Yukawa couplings. For Majorana neutrinos, spontaneous breaking of the gauged $B-L$ symmetry gives a cosmic string induced gravitational wave signal flat over a large range of frequencies, whereas for Dirac neutrinos, spontaneous and soft-breaking of a $Z\_2$ symmetry generate a peaked gravitational wave spectrum from annihilation of domain walls. The striking difference between the shape of the spectra in the two cases can help differentiate between Dirac vs Majorana neutrino masses in the two class of models considered, complementing results of neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.

2023-06-08, **FCNC charmed-hadron decays with invisible singlet particles in light of recent data**, Geng Li et.al., [2306.05333v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05333v1)

 The flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) decays of charmed hadrons with missing energy ($\slashed E$) can serve as potentially promising hunting grounds for hints of new physics, as the standard-model backgrounds are very suppressed. A few of such processes have been searched for in recent experiments, particularly $D^0\to\slashed E$ by Belle and $D^0\to\pi^0\slashed E$ and $\Lambda\_c^+\to p\slashed E$ by BESIII, resulting in upper bounds on their branching fractions. We consider them to illuminate the possible contributions of the quark transition $c\to u\slashed E$ with a couple of invisible spinless bosons carrying away the missing energy, assuming that they are not charge conjugates of each other and hence can have unequal masses. We find that these data are complementary in that they constrain different sets of the underlying operators and do not cover the same ranges of the bosons' masses, but there are regions not yet accessible. From the allowed parameter space, we show that other $D$-meson decays, such as $D\to\rho\slashed E$, and the charmed-baryon ones $\Xi\_c\to(\Sigma,\Lambda)\slashed E$ can have sizable branching fractions and therefore may offer further probes of the new-physics interactions. We point out the importance of $D^0\to\gamma\slashed E$ which are not yet searched for but could access parts of the parameter space beyond the reach of the other modes. In addition, we look at a scenario where the invisibles are instead fermionic, namely sterile neutrinos, and a scalar leptoquark mediates $c\to u\slashed E$. We discuss the implications of the aforesaid bounds for this model. The predictions we make for the various charmed-hadron decays in the different scenarios may be testable in the near future by BESIII and Belle II.

2023-06-08, **Chiral EFT calculation of neutrino reactions in warm neutron-rich matter**, Eunkyoung Shin et.al., [2306.05280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05280v1)

 Neutrino scattering and absorption rates of relevance to supernovae and neutron star mergers are obtained from nuclear matter dynamical structure functions that encode many-body effects from nuclear mean fields and correlations. We employ nuclear interactions from chiral effective field theory to calculate the density, spin, isospin, and spin-isospin response functions of warm beta-equilibrium nuclear matter. We include corrections to the single-particle energies in the mean field approximation as well as vertex corrections resummed in the random phase approximation (RPA), including, for the first time, both direct and exchange diagrams. We find that correlations included through the RPA redistribute the strength of the response to higher energy for neutrino absorption and lower energy for antineutrino absorption. This tends to suppress the absorption rate of electron neutrinos across all relevant energy scales. In contrast, the inclusion of RPA correlations enhances the electron antineutrino absorption rate at low energy and supresses the rate at high energy. These effects are especially important at high-density and in the vicinity of the neutrino decoupling region. Implications for heavy element nucleosynthesis, electromagnetic signatures of compact object mergers, supernova dynamics, and neutrino detection from galactic supernovae are discussed briefly.

2023-06-08, **Probing Dual NSI and CP Violation in DUNE and T2HK**, Barnali Brahma et.al., [2306.05258v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05258v1)

 The latest results from the long baseline neutrino experiments show a hint of non-zero CP violation in the neutrino sector. In this article, we study the CP violation effects in the upcoming long-baseline neutrino experiments DUNE and T2HK. Non-standard interactions can affect the cleaner determination of CP violation parameter. It has been argued that the NSI can help alleviate the tension between the recent $\delta\_{CP}$ measurements of NO$\nu$A and T2K experiments. We consider here the dual NSI due to $\epsilon\_{e\mu}$ and $\epsilon\_{e\tau}$, arising simultaneously to see the effects in neutrino oscillation probabilities. Moreover, the CP asymmetry parameter $A\_{CP}$ exhibits a clear distinction between normal and inverted mass orderings in the DUNE experiment.

2023-06-07, **Multimessenger Emission from the Accretion Induced Collapse of White Dwarfs**, Luís Felipe Longo Micchi et.al., [2306.04711v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04711v1)

 We present fully general-relativistic three-dimensional numerical simulations of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs (WDs). We evolve three different WD models (nonrotating, rotating at 80% and 99% of the Keplerian mass shedding limit) that collapse due to electron capture. For each of these models, we provide a detailed analysis of their gravitational waves (GWs), neutrinos and electromagnetic counterpart and discuss their detectability. Our results suggest that fast rotating AICs could be detectable up to a distance of 8 Mpc with third-generation GW observatories, and up to 1 Mpc with LIGO. AIC progenitors are expected to have large angular momentum due to their accretion history, which is a determining factor for their stronger GW emission compared to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Regarding neutrino emission, we found no significant difference between AICs and CCSNe. In the electromagnetic spectrum, we find that AICs are two orders of magnitude fainter than type Ia supernovae. Our work places AICs as realistic targets for future multimessenger searches with third generation ground-based GW detectors.

2023-06-07, **Gravitational waves from phase transitions and cosmic strings in neutrino mass models with multiple Majorons**, Pasquale Di Bari et.al., [2306.04680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04680v1)

 We explore the origin of Majorana masses within the Majoron model and how this can lead to the generation of a distinguishable primordial stochastic background of gravitational waves. We first show how in the simplest Majoron model only a contribution from cosmic string can be within the reach of planned experiments. We then consider extensions containing multiple complex scalars, demonstrating how in this case a spectrum comprising contributions from both a strong first order phase transition and cosmic strings can naturally emerge. We show that the interplay between multiple scalar fields can amplify the phase transition signal, potentially leading to double peaks over the wideband sloped spectrum from cosmic strings. We also underscore the possibility of observing such a gravitational wave background to provide insights into the reheating temperature of the universe. We conclude highlighting how the model can be naturally combined with scenarios addressing the origin of matter of the universe, where baryogenesis occurs via leptogenesis and a right-handed neutrino plays the role of dark matter.

2023-06-07, **$β^-$ decay $Q$-value measurement of $^{136}$Cs and its implications to neutrino studies**, Z. Ge et.al., [2306.04604v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04604v2)

 The $\beta^-$ decay $Q$-value of $^{136}$Cs ($J^\pi = 5^+$, $t\_{1/2} \approx 13$~days) was measured with the JYFLTRAP Penning trap setup at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line (IGISOL) facility of the University of Jyv\"askyl\"a, Finland. The mono-isotopic samples required in the measurements were prepared with a new scheme utilised for the cleaning, based on the coupling of dipolar excitation with Ramsey's method of time-separated oscillatory fields and the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance (PI-ICR) technique. The $Q$ value is determined to be 2536.83(45) keV, which is $\sim$4 times more precise and 11.4(20) keV ($\sim$ 6$\sigma$) smaller than the adopted value in the most recent Atomic Mass Evaluation AME2020. The daughter, $^{136}$Ba, has a 4$^+$ state at 2544.481(24) keV and a $3^-$ state at 2532.653(23) keV, both of which can potentially be ultralow $Q$-value end-states for the $^{136}$Cs decay. With our new ground-to-ground state $Q$ value, the decay energies to these two states become -7.65(45) keV and 4.18(45) keV, respectively. The former is confirmed to be negative at the level of $\sim$ 17$\sigma$, which verifies that this transition is not a suitable candidate for neutrino mass determination. On the other hand, the slightly negative $Q$ value makes this transition an interesting candidate for the study of virtual $\beta$-$\gamma$ transitions. The decay to the 3$^{-}$ state is validated to have a positive low $Q$ value which makes it a viable candidate for neutrino mass determination. For this transition, we obtained a shell-model-based half-life estimate of $2.1\_{-0.8}^{+1.6}\times10^{12}$ yr.

2023-06-07, **Structure Factors for Hot Neutron Matter from Ab Initio Lattice Simulations with High-Fidelity Chiral Interactions**, Yuan-Zhuo Ma et.al., [2306.04500v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04500v1)

 We present the first ab initio lattice calculations of spin and density correlations in hot neutron matter using high-fidelity interactions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) in chiral effective field theory. These correlations have a large impact on neutrino heating and shock revival in core-collapse supernovae and are encapsulated in functions called structure factors. Unfortunately, calculations of structure factors using high-fidelity chiral interactions were well out of reach using existing computational methods. In this work, we solve the problem using a computational approach called the rank-one operator (RO) method. The RO method is a general technique with broad applications to simulations of fermionic many-body systems. It uses the fact that the determinant of a matrix composed of rank-one operators is at most linear in each operator coefficient. Using the RO method, we compute the vector and axial static structure factors for hot neutron matter as a function of temperature and density. The ab initio lattice results are in good agreement with virial expansion calculations at low densities and can be used to calibrate random phase approximation codes commonly used to estimate many-body effects on the neutrino opacity in core-collapse supernovae.

2023-06-08, **Weakly Lensed Gravitational Waves: Probing Cosmic Structures with Wave-Optics Features**, Stefano Savastano et.al., [2306.05282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05282v1)

 Every signal propagating through the universe is at least weakly lensed by the intervening gravitational field. In some situations, wave-optics phenomena (diffraction, interference) can be observed as frequency-dependent modulations of the waveform of gravitational waves (GWs). We will denote these signatures as Wave-Optics Features (WOFs) and analyze them in detail. Our framework can efficiently and accurately compute WOF in the single-image regime, of which weak lensing is a limit. The phenomenology of WOF is rich and offers valuable information: the dense cusps of individual halos appear as peaks in Green's function for lensing. If resolved, these features probe the number, effective masses, spatial distribution and inner profiles of substructures. High signal-to-noise GW signals reveal WOFs well beyond the Einstein radius, leading to a fair probability of observation by upcoming detectors such as LISA. Potential applications of WOF include reconstruction of the lens' projected density, delensing standard sirens and inferring large-scale structure morphology and the halo mass function. Because WOF are sourced by light halos with negligible baryonic content, their detection (or lack thereof) holds promise to test dark matter scenarios.

2023-06-08, **Neutral bremsstrahlung electroluminescence in noble liquids revisited**, A. Buzulutskov et.al., [2306.04991v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04991v1)

 Recent discovery of neutral bremsstrahlung (NBrS) mechanism of electroluminescence (EL) in noble gases in two-phase detectors for dark matter searches has led to a prediction that NBrS EL should be present in noble liquids as well. A rigorous theory of NBrS EL in noble liquids was developed accordingly in the framework of Cohen-Leckner and Atrazhev formalism. It has been recently followed by the first experimental observation of NBrS EL in liquid argon, which however deviates significantly from the previous theory. Given these results, we revise previous theoretical calculations of EL NBrS in noble liquids to be consistent with experiment. In particular, NBrS EL yield and spectra were calculated in this work for argon, krypton and xenon with momentum-transfer cross section of electron-atom scattering (instead of energy-transfer one) being used for calculation of NBrS cross section. The results for light noble liquids, helium and neon, are also reexamined.

2023-06-07, **Shadow and deflection angle of asymptotic, magnetically-charged, non-singular black hole**, Yashmitha Kumaran et.al., [2306.04705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04705v1)

 In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of an asymptotic, magnetically-charged, non-singular (AMCNS) black hole. By utilizing the Gauss-bonnet theorem, we aim to unravel the intricate astrophysics associated with this unique black hole. The study explored various aspects including the black hole's gravitational field, intrinsic properties, light bending, the shadow and greybody bounding of the black hole. Through rigorous calculations and simulations, we derive the weak deflection angle of the optical metric of AMCNS black hole. Additionally, we investigate the impact of the dark matter medium on the deflection angle, examined the distinctive features of the black hole's shadow, and bound its greybody factors. Our findings not only deepen our understanding of gravitational lensing but also pave the way for future improvements in black hole theories by minimizing restrictive assumptions and incorporating a more realistic representation of these cosmic phenomena.

2023-06-07, **DELVE 6: An Ancient, Ultra-Faint Star Cluster on the Outskirts of the Magellanic Clouds**, W. Cerny et.al., [2306.04690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04690v1)

 We present the discovery of DELVE 6, an ultra-faint stellar system identified in the second data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) survey. Based on a maximum-likelihood fit to its structure and stellar population, we find that DELVE 6 is an old ($\tau > 9.8$ Gyr, at 95% confidence) and metal-poor ($\rm [Fe/H] < -1.17$ dex, at 95% confidence) stellar system with an absolute magnitude of $M\_V = -1.5^{+0.4}\_{-0.6}$ mag and an azimuthally-averaged half-light radius of $r\_{1/2} =10^{+4}\_{-3}$ pc. These properties are consistent with the population of ultra-faint star clusters uncovered by recent surveys. Interestingly, DELVE 6 is located at an angular separation of $\sim 10\deg$ from the center of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), corresponding to a three-dimensional physical separation of $\sim 20$ kpc given the system's observed distance ($D\_{\odot} = 80$ kpc). This also places the system $\sim 35$ kpc from the center of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), lying within recent constraints on the size of the LMC's dark matter halo. We tentatively measure the proper motion of DELVE 6 using data from $\textit{Gaia}$, which we find supports a potential association between the system and the LMC/SMC. Although future kinematic measurements will be necessary to determine its origins, we highlight that DELVE 6 may represent only the second or third ancient ($\tau > 9$ Gyr) star cluster associated with the SMC, or one of fewer than two dozen ancient clusters associated with the LMC. Nonetheless, we cannot currently rule out the possibility that the system is a distant Milky Way halo star cluster.

2023-06-07, **Heavy QCD axion dark matter from avoided level crossing**, David Cyncynates et.al., [2306.04678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04678v1)

 The QCD axion offers a natural resolution to the strong CP problem and provides a compelling dark matter candidate. If the QCD axion constitutes all the dark matter, the simplest models pick out a narrow range of masses around $100\,\mu{\rm eV}$. We point out a natural production mechanism for QCD axion dark matter with masses up to the astrophysical bound of $1 \,{\rm eV}$. If the QCD axion mixes with a sterile axion, the relative temperature dependence of their potentials can lead to an avoided level crossing of their mass eigenstates. This leads to a near-total transfer of energy density from the sterile axion to the QCD axion, resulting in a late-time QCD axion abundance sufficient to make up all of present-day dark matter. Our result provides additional theoretical motivation for several direct detection experiments that will probe this part of parameter space in the near future.

2023-06-07, **Milky Way satellite velocities reveal the Dark Matter power spectrum at small scales**, Ivan Esteban et.al., [2306.04674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04674v1)

 Dark Matter (DM) properties at small scales remain uncertain. Recent theoretical and observational advances have provided the tools to narrow them down. Here, we show for the first time that the correlation between internal velocities and sizes of dwarf galaxies is a sharp probe of small-scale DM properties. We study modified DM power spectra, motivated by DM production during inflation. Using semi-analytic models and scaling relations, we show that such models can change the kinematics and structure of dwarf galaxies without strongly affecting their total abundance. We analyze data from Milky Way classical satellite galaxies and those discovered with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), finding that the DM power spectrum at comoving scales ${4\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} < k < 37\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$ cannot deviate by more than a factor of 2 from scale invariance. Our results are robust against baryonic uncertainties such as the stellar mass-halo mass relation, halo occupation fraction, and subhalo tidal disruption; allowing us to independently constrain them. This work thus opens a window to probe both dwarf galaxy formation models and small-scale DM properties.

2023-06-07, **The CYGNO experiment, a directional detector for direct Dark Matter searches**, F. D. Amaro et.al., [2306.04568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04568v1)

 The CYGNO project aims at the development of a high precision optical readout gaseous Tima Projection Chamber (TPC) for directional dark matter (DM) searches, to be hosted at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). CYGNO employs a He:CF$\_4$ gas mixture at atmospheric pressure with a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) based amplification structure coupled to an optical readout comprised of sCMOS cameras and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). This experimental setup allows to achieve 3D tracking and background rejection down to O(1) keV energy, to boost sensitivity to low WIMP masses. The characteristics of the optical readout approach in terms of the light yield will be illustrated along with the particle identification properties. The project timeline foresees, in the next 2-3 years, the realisation and installation of a 0.4 m$^3$ TPC in the underground laboratories at LNGS to act as a demonstrator. Finally, the studies of the expected DM sensitivities of the CYGNO demonstrator will be presented.

2023-06-07, **Palatini $f(R)$ gravity tests in the weak field limit: Solar System, seismology and galaxies**, Alejandro Hernandez-Arboleda et.al., [2306.04475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04475v1)

 Palatini $f(R)$ gravity is probably the simplest extension of general relativity (GR) and the simplest realization of a metric-affine theory. It has the same number of degrees of freedom as GR and, in vacuum, it is straightforwardly mapped into GR with a cosmological constant. The mapping between GR and Palatini $f(R)$ inside matter is possible but at the expense of reinterpreting the meaning of the matter fields. The physical meaning and consequences of such mapping will depend on the physical context. Here we consider three such cases within the weak field limit: Solar System dynamics, planetary internal dynamics (seismology), and galaxies. After revising our previous results on the Solar System and Earth's seismology, we consider here the possibility of $f(R)$ Palatini as a dark matter candidate. For any $f(R)$ that admits a polynomial approximation in the weak field limit, we show here, using SPARC data and a recent method that we proposed, that the theory cannot be used to replace dark matter in galaxies. We also show that the same result applies to the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity. Differently from the metric $f(R)$ case, the rotation curve data are sufficient for this conclusion. This result does not exclude a combination of modified gravity and dark matter.

2023-06-07, **Dark Matter Constraints from Isomeric $^{\bf 178m}$Hf**, D. S. M. Alves et.al., [2306.04442v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04442v1)

 We describe a first measurement of the radiation from a $^{\bf 178m}$Hf sample to search for dark matter. The $\gamma$ flux from this sample, possessed by Los Alamos National Laboratory nuclear chemistry, was measured with a Ge detector at a distance of 4 ft due to its high activity. We search for $\gamma$s that cannot arise from the radioactive decay of $^{\bf 178m}$Hf, but might arise from the production of a nuclear state due to the inelastic scattering with dark matter. The limits obtained on this $\gamma$ flux are then translated into constraints on the parameter space of inelastic dark matter. Finally, we describe the potential reach of future studies with $^{\bf 178m}$Hf.

2023-06-07, **Electroweak Corrections to Higgs Boson Decays in a Complex Singlet Extension of the SM and their Phenomenological Impact**, Felix Egle et.al., [2306.04127v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04127v1)

 The complex singlet extension CxSM of the Standard Model (SM) is a simple extension of the SM with two visible Higgs bosons in the spectrum and a Dark Matter (DM) candidate. In this paper we complete the computation of the next-to-leading (NLO) electroweak (EW) corrections to on-shell and non-loop-induced Higgs decays. Our calculations are implemented in the code EWsHDECAY which also includes the relevant QCD corrections. Performing an extensive parameter scan in the model and including all relevant theoretical and experimental single- and di-Higgs as well as DM constraints, we obtain a viable parameter sample. We find that current DM constraints are able to test the model in DM mass regions where collider searches are not sensitive. The relative EW corrections turn out to be large for scenarios with relatively large couplings, threshold effects or small leading-order (LO) widths. Otherwise, they are of typical EW size and can amount up to about 20-25%. The theory uncertainty derived from the change of the renormalization scheme dependence then is of a few per cent. While the NLO corrections applied in the constraints due to single- and di-Higgs searches impact the validity of specific parameter points, the overall shape of the allowed parameter region is not yet sensitive to the EW corrections. This picture will change with further increased experimental precision in the future and necessitates precise predictions on the theory side as presented in this paper.

2023-06-08, **The magnetic, spectroscopic, and photometric variability of the Wolf-Rayet star WR55**, S. P. Järvinen et.al., [2306.05038v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05038v1)

 Studies of magnetic fields in the most evolved massive stars, the Wolf-Rayet stars, are of special importance because they are progenitors of certain types of supernovae. The first detection of a magnetic field of the order of a few hundred Gauss in the WN7 star WR55, based on a few FORS2 low-resolution spectropolarimetric observations, was reported in 2020. In this work we present new FORS2 observations allowing us to detect magnetic and spectroscopic variability with a period of 11.90 h. No significant frequencies were detected in TESS and ASAS-SN photometric observations. Importantly, magnetic field detections are achieved currently only in two Wolf-Rayet stars, WR6 and WR55, both showing the presence of corotating interacting regions.

2023-06-08, **The hadronic equation of state of HESS J1731-347 from the relativistic mean-field model with tensor coupling**, Kaixuan Huang et.al., [2306.04992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04992v1)

 A recent report has identified a central compact object (CCO) within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, with a mass and radius of $M=0.77^{+0.20}\_{-0.17}M{\odot}$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}\_{-0.78}$ km, respectively. To investigate this light compact star, a density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) model, specifically the DDVT model, has been employed. The DDVT model incorporates tensor couplings of vector mesons, which {can} successfully describe the properties of finite nuclei, such as charge radius, binding energy, and spin-orbit splitting. The introduction of tensor coupling reduces the influence of scalar mesons and generates a softer equation of state (EOS) in the outer core of the neutron star. Moreover, it has been found that the crust segment plays a crucial role in reproducing the mass-radius relation of HESS J1731-347, indicating a preference for a soft crust EOS. By manipulating the coupling strength of the isovector meson in the DDVT parameter set, a reasonable hadronic EOS has been obtained, satisfying the constraints from the gravitational-wave signal GW170817, the simultaneous mass-radius measurements from the NICER collaboration, and the properties of finite nuclei. Notably, the mass-radius relations derived from this hadronic EOS also accurately describe the observables of HESS J1731-347. Therefore, based on our estimation, the CCO in HESS J1731-347 may represent the lightest known neutron star.

2023-06-07, **Early hard X-rays from the nearby core-collapse supernova SN2023ixf**, Brian W. Grefenstette et.al., [2306.04827v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04827v1)

 We present NuSTAR observations of the nearby SN 2023ixf in M101 (d=6.9 Mpc) which provide the earliest hard X-ray detection of a non-relativistic stellar explosion to date at $\delta t\approx$4-d and $\delta t\approx$11-d. The spectra are well described by a hot thermal bremsstrahlung continuum with $T>25 \rm{keV}$ shining through a thick neutral medium with a neutral hydrogen column that decreases with time (initial $N\_{\rm{Hint}}=2.6\times 10^{23} \rm{cm^{-2}}$). A prominent neutral Fe K$\alpha$ emission line is clearly detected, similar to other strongly interacting SNe such as SN2020jl. The rapidly decreasing intrinsic absorption with time suggests the presence of a dense but confined circumstellar medium (CSM). The absorbed broadband X-ray luminosity (0.3--79 keV) is $L\_{X} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ during both epochs, with the increase in overall X-ray flux related to the decrease in the absorbing column. Interpreting these observations in the context of thermal bremsstrahlung radiation originating from the interaction of the SN shock with a dense medium we infer large particle densities in excess of $n\_{\rm{CSM}}\approx 4\times 10^{8} \rm{cm^{-3}}$ at $r<10^{15} \rm{cm}$, corresponding to an enhanced progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot M \approx 3\times 10^{-4}$ M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for an assumed wind velocity of $v\_w=50$ km s$^{-1}$.

2023-06-07, **GHOST Commissioning Science Results: Identifying a new chemically peculiar star in Reticulum II**, Christian R. Hayes et.al., [2306.04804v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04804v1)

 The Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) is the newest high resolution spectrograph to be developed for a large aperture telescope, recently deployed and commissioned at the Gemini-South telescope. In this paper, we present the first science results from the GHOST spectrograph taking during its commissioning runs. We have observed the bright metal-poor benchmark star HD 122563, along with two stars in the ultra faint dwarf galaxy, Ret II, one of which was previously identified as a candidate member, but did not have a previous detailed chemical abundance analysis. This star (GDR3 0928) is found to be a bona fide member of Ret II, and from a spectral synthesis analysis, it is also revealed to be a CEMP-r star, with significant enhancements in the several light elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, and Si), in addition to featuring an r-process enhancement like many other Ret II stars. The light-element enhancements in this star resemble the abundance patterns seen in the CEMP-no stars of other ultra faint dwarf galaxies, and are thought to have been produced by an independent source from the r-process. These unusual abundance patterns are thought to be produced by faint supernovae, which may be produced by some of the earliest generations of stars.

2023-06-07, **SN2023ixf in Messier 101: A Variable Red Supergiant as the Progenitor Candidate to a Type II Supernova**, Charles D. Kilpatrick et.al., [2306.04722v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04722v1)

 We present pre-explosion optical and infrared (IR) imaging at the site of the type II supernova (SN II) 2023ixf in Messier 101 at 6.9 Mpc. We astrometrically registered a ground-based image of SN 2023ixf to archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer), and ground-based near-IR images. A single point source is detected at a position consistent with the SN at wavelengths ranging from HST $R$-band to Spitzer 4.5 $\mu$m. Fitting to blackbody and red supergiant (RSG) spectral-energy distributions (SEDs), we find that the source is anomalously cool with a significant mid-IR excess. We interpret this SED as reprocessed emission in a 8600 $R\_{\odot}$ circumstellar shell of dusty material with a mass $\sim$5$\times10^{-5} M\_{\odot}$ surrounding a $\log(L/L\_{\odot})=4.74\pm0.07$ and $T\_{\rm eff}=3920\substack{+200\\-160}$ K RSG. This luminosity is consistent with RSG models of initial mass 11 $M\_{\odot}$, depending on assumptions of rotation and overshooting. In addition, the counterpart was significantly variable in pre-explosion Spitzer 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m imaging, exhibiting $\sim$70% variability in both bands correlated across 9 yr and 29 epochs of imaging. The variations appear to have a timescale of 2.8 yr, which is consistent with $\kappa$-mechanism pulsations observed in RSGs, albeit with a much larger amplitude than RSGs such as $\alpha$ Orionis (Betelgeuse).

 We present UV/optical observations and models of supernova (SN) 2023ixf, a type II SN located in Messier 101 at 6.9 Mpc. Early-time ("flash") spectroscopy of SN 2023ixf, obtained primarily at Lick Observatory, reveals emission lines of H I, He I/II, C IV, and N III/IV/V with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings arising from the photo-ionization of dense, close-in circumstellar material (CSM) located around the progenitor star prior to shock breakout. These electron-scattering broadened line profiles persist for $\sim$8 days with respect to first light, at which time Doppler broadened features from the fastest SN ejecta form, suggesting a reduction in CSM density at $r \gtrsim 10^{15}$ cm. The early-time light curve of SN2023ixf shows peak absolute magnitudes (e.g., $M\_{u} = -18.6$ mag, $M\_{g} = -18.4$ mag) that are $\gtrsim 2$ mag brighter than typical type II supernovae, this photometric boost also being consistent with the shock power supplied from CSM interaction. Comparison of SN 2023ixf to a grid of light curve and multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN and the radiation-hydrodynamics code HERACLES suggests dense, solar-metallicity, CSM confined to $r = (0.5-1) \times 10^{15}$ cm and a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 10^{-2}$ M$\_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. For the assumed progenitor wind velocity of $v\_w = 50$ km s$^{-1}$, this corresponds to enhanced mass-loss (i.e., ``super-wind'' phase) during the last $\sim$3-6 years before explosion.

 Eruptive mass loss of massive stars prior to supernova (SN) explosion is key to understanding their evolution and end fate. An observational signature of pre-SN mass loss is the detection of an early, short-lived peak prior to the radioactive-powered peak in the lightcurve of the SN. This is usually attributed to the SN shock passing through an extended envelope or circumstellar medium (CSM). Such an early peak is common for double-peaked Type IIb SNe with an extended Hydrogen envelope but is uncommon for normal Type Ibc SNe with very compact progenitors. In this paper, we systematically study a sample of 14 double-peaked Type Ibc SNe out of 475 Type Ibc SNe detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility. The rate of these events is ~ 3-9 % of Type Ibc SNe. A strong correlation is seen between the peak brightness of the first and the second peak. We perform a holistic analysis of this sample's photometric and spectroscopic properties. We find that six SNe have ejecta mass less than 1.5 Msun. Based on the nebular spectra and lightcurve properties, we estimate that the progenitor masses for these are less than ~ 12 Msun. The rest have an ejecta mass > 2.4 Msun and a higher progenitor mass. This sample suggests that the SNe with low progenitor masses undergo late-time binary mass transfer. Meanwhile, the SNe with higher progenitor masses are consistent with wave-driven mass loss or pulsation-pair instability-driven mass loss simulations.

2023-06-07, **Classifying IGR J15038-6021 as a magnetic CV with a massive white dwarf**, John A. Tomsick et.al., [2306.04691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04691v1)

 Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary systems consisting of a white dwarf (WD) accreting matter from a companion star. Observations of CVs provide an opportunity to learn about accretion disks, the physics of compact objects, classical novae, and the evolution of the binary and the WD that may ultimately end in a type Ia supernova (SN). As type Ia SNe involve a WD reaching the Chandrasekhar limit or merging WDs, WD mass measurements are particularly important for elucidating the path from CV to type Ia SN. For intermediate polar (IP) type CVs, the WD mass is related to the bremsstrahlung temperature of material in the accretion column, which typically peaks at X-ray energies. Thus, the IPs with the strongest hard X-ray emission, such as those discovered by the INTEGRAL satellite, are expected to have the highest masses. Here, we report on XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and optical observations of IGR J15038-6021. We find an X-ray periodicity of 1678+/-2s, which we interpret as the WD spin period. From fitting the 0.3-79 keV spectrum with a model that uses the relationship between the WD mass and the post-shock temperature, we measure a WD mass of 1.36+0.04-0.11 Msun. This follows an earlier study of IGR J14091-6108, which also has a WD with a mass approaching the Chandrasekhar limit. We demonstrate that these are both outliers among IPs in having massive WDs and discuss the results in the context of WD mass studies as well as the implications for WD mass evolution.

2023-06-07, **Implications of a Possible Spectral Structure of Cosmic-ray Protons Unveiled by the DAMPE**, Lin Nie et.al., [2306.04558v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04558v2)

 The recent observations revealed that the cosmic-ray (CR) proton spectrum showed a complex structure: the hardening at $\rm \sim 200~GeV$ and softening at $\rm \sim 10~TeV$. However, so far the physical origins of this spectral feature remain strongly debated. In this work, we simulate the acceleration of cosmic-ray protons in a nearby Supernova remnant (SNR) by solving numerically the hydrodynamic equations and the equation for the quasi-isotropic CR momentum distribution in the spherically symmetrical case to derive the spectrum of protons injected into the interstellar medium (ISM), and then simulate the propagation process of those accelerated CR particles to calculate the proton fluxes reaching the Earth. Besides, we use the DRAGON numerical code to calculate the large-scale cosmic-ray proton spectrum. Our simulated results are in good agreement with the observed data (including the observed data of proton fluxes and dipole anisotropy). We conclude that the spectral feature of cosmic-ray protons in this energy band may originate from the superposition of the distribution from the nearby SNR and background diffusive cosmic-ray component. We find that the release of particles from this nearby SNR has a time delay. Besides, it can be found that the nonlinear response of energetic particles, release time of CR protons, and age of the local SNR can leave strong signatures in the spectrum of the resulting CR proton fluxes.
