2023-08-03, **Galactic Core-Collapse Supernovae at IceCube: "Fire Drill" Data Challenges and follow-up**, Spencer Griswold et.al., [2308.01843v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01843v1)

 The next Galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make astrophysical measurements using neutrinos, gravitational waves, and electromagnetic radiation. CCSNe local to the Milky Way are extremely rare, so it is paramount that detectors are prepared to observe the signal when it arrives. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a gigaton water Cherenkov detector below the South Pole, is sensitive to the burst of neutrinos released by a Galactic CCSN at a level $>$10$\sigma$. This burst of neutrinos precedes optical emission by hours to days, enabling neutrinos to serve as an early warning for follow-up observation. IceCube's detection capabilities make it a cornerstone of the global network of neutrino detectors monitoring for Galactic CCSNe, the SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS 2.0). In this contribution, we describe IceCube's sensitivity to Galactic CCSNe and strategies for operational readiness, including "fire drill" data challenges. We also discuss coordination with SNEWS 2.0.

2023-08-03, **Parametrized uncertainties in the spectral function model of neutrino charged-current quasielastic interactions for oscillation analyses**, J. Chakrani et.al., [2308.01838v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01838v1)

 A substantial fraction of systematic uncertainties in neutrino oscillation experiments stem from the lack of precision in modeling the nuclear target in neutrino-nucleus interactions. Whilst this has driven significant progress in the development of improved nuclear models for neutrino scattering, it is crucial that the models used in neutrino data analyses be accompanied by parameters and associated uncertainties that allow the coverage of plausible nuclear physics. Based on constraints from electron scattering data, we develop such a set of parameters, which can be applied to nuclear shell models, and test their application to the Benhar et al spectral function model. The parametrization is validated through a series of maximum likelihood fits to cross-section measurements made by the T2K and MINERvA experiments, which also permit an exploration of the power of near-detector data to provide constraints on the parameters in neutrino oscillation analyses.

2023-08-03, **New Constraint on Dark Photon at T2K Off-Axis Near Detector**, Takeshi Araki et.al., [2308.01565v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01565v1)

 The T2K experiment is one of the most powerful long-baseline experiments to investigate neutrino oscillations. The off-axis near detector called ND280 is installed 280 m downstream from the neutrino production target to measure the neutrino energy spectrum. In this paper, we study the capability of the ND280 detector to search for the dark photon produced through the meson rare decay and proton bremsstrahlung processes at the proton beam dump. We find that the ten-year operation of T2K with the ND280 detector excludes the unexplored parameter region for the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing. We also show that a broader parameter region can be searched by the ND280 in the future T2K operation for dark photon as well as U(1)$\_{B-L}$ gauge boson.

2023-08-03, **Longer-Lived Mediators from Charged Mesons and Photons at Neutrino Experiments**, Bhaskar Dutta et.al., [2308.01491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01491v1)

 Since many of the dark-sector particles interact with Standard Model (SM) particles in multiple ways, they can appear in experimental facilities where SM particles appear in abundance. In this study, we explore a particular class of longer-lived mediators that are produced from photons, charged mesons, neutral mesons, and $e^\pm$ that arise in proton-beam fixed-target-type neutrino experiments. This class of mediators encompasses light scalars that appear in theories like extended Higgs sectors, muon(electro)philic scalars, etc. We evaluate the sensitivities of these mediators at beam-based neutrino experiments such as the finished ArgoNeuT, ongoing MicroBooNE, SBND, ICARUS, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. We realize that scalars are more enhanced while produced from three-body decay of charged mesons, especially if they are muonphilic in nature. For scenarios that contain muonphilic scalars, these experiments can probe unexplored regions of parameter space that can explain the current discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of muons. The sensitivity of electrophilic scalars at the DUNE Near Detector can explore new regions. We also show that Bethe-Heitler scattering processes can be used to probe flavor-specific lepton final states even for the mediator masses below twice the lepton mass.

2023-08-03, **On the feasibility of primordial black hole abundance constraints using lensing parallax of GRBs**, Priyanka Gawade et.al., [2308.01775v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01775v1)

 Primordial black holes, which could have formed during the early Universe through overdensities in primordial density fluctuations during inflation, are potential candidates for dark matter. We explore the use of lensing parallax of Gamma ray bursts, which results in different fluxes being observed from two different vantage points, in order to probe the abundance of primordial black holes in the unexplored window within the mass range $[10^{-15}-10^{-11}]M\_\odot$. We derive the optical depth for the detectability of lensing of GRBs with a distribution of source properties and realistic detector sensitivities. We comment on the ability of the proposed Indian twin satellite mission Daksha in its low earth orbit to conduct this experiment. If the two Daksha satellites observe 10000 GRBs simultaneously and the entirety of dark matter is made up of $[10^{-15}-10^{-12}]M\_\odot$ black holes, Daksha will detect non-zero lensing events with a probability ranging from [80, 50] per cent. Non-detections will not conclusively rule out primordial black holes as dark matter in this mass range. However, we show that meaningful constraints can be obtained in such a case if the two satellites are separated by at least the Earth-Moon distance.

2023-08-03, **The oblateness of dark matter halos of nearby galaxies and its correlation with gas mass fractions**, Mousumi Das et.al., [2308.01601v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01601v1)

 We present a method to measure the the oblateness parameter q of the dark matter halos of gas rich galaxies that have extended HI disks. We have applied our model to a sample of 20 nearby galaxies that are gas rich and close to face-on, of which 6 are large disk galaxies, 8 have moderate stellar masses and 6 are low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxies. We have used the stacked HI velocity dispersion and HI surface densities to derive q in the outer disk regions. Our most important result is that gas dominated galaxies (such as LSB dwarfs) that have M(gas)/M(baryons)>0.5 have oblate halos (q<0.55), whereas stellar dominated galaxies have a range of q values from 0.2 to 1.3. We also find a significant positive correlation between q and stellar mass, which indicates that galaxies with massive stellar disks have a higher probability of having halos that are spherical or slightly prolate, whereas low mass galaxies preferably have oblate halos. We briefly also discuss how the halo shape affects the disks of galaxies, especially the oblate halos.

2023-08-03, **A search for dark matter-nucleon interactions with a dark mediator in PandaX-4T**, Di Huang et.al., [2308.01540v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01540v1)

 We report results of a search for dark matter-nucleon interactions via a dark mediator using optimized low-energy data from the PandaX-4T liquid xenon experiment. With the ionization-signal-only data and utilizing the Migdal effect, we set the most stringent limits on the cross section for dark matter masses ranging from 40~$\rm{MeV}$$/c^2$ to 2~$\rm{GeV}$$/c^2$. Under the assumption that the dark mediator is a dark photon, we provide new limits on the kinetic mixing parameter between the dark photon and the ordinary photon, and rule out significant parameter space of the thermal relic dark matter under this scenario.

2023-08-03, **Carnegie Supernova Project-I and -II: Measurements of $H_0$ using Cepheid, TRGB, and SBF Distance Calibration to Type Ia Supernovae**, Syed A. Uddin et.al., [2308.01875v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01875v1)

 We present an analysis of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe~Ia) from both the Carnegie Supernova Project~I (CSP-I) and II (CSP-II), and extend the Hubble diagram from the optical to the near-infrared wavelengths ($uBgVriYJH$). We calculate the Hubble constant, $H\_0$ using various distance calibrators: Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), and Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF). Combining all methods of calibrations, we derive $\rm H\_0=71.43 \pm 0.62 \ (stat) \pm 2.43 \ (sys) \ km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}$ from $B$-band, and $\rm H\_0=72.65 \pm 0.63 \ (stat) \pm 2.88 \ (sys) \ km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}$ from $H$-band. By assigning equal weight to the Cepheid, TRGB, and SBF calibrators, we derive the systematic errors required for consistency in the first rung of the distance ladder, resulting in an increased systematic error in $H\_0$. As a result, the tension between the late-time $H\_0$ we derive by combining the various distance calibrators and the early-time $H\_0$ from the Cosmic Microwave Background is reduced. The highest precision in SN~Ia luminosity is found in the $Y$ band ($0.12\pm0.01$ mag), as defined by the intrinsic scatter ($\sigma\_{int}$). We revisit SN~Ia Hubble residual-host mass correlations and recover previous results that these correlations do not change significantly between the optical and the near-infrared wavelengths. Finally, SNe~Ia that explode beyond 10 kpc from their host centers exhibit smaller dispersion in their luminosity, confirming our earlier findings. Reduced effect of dust in the outskirt of hosts may be responsible for this effect.

2023-08-03, **Interacting supernovae from wide massive binary systems**, Andrea Ercolino et.al., [2308.01819v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01819v1)

 Many supernovae (SNe) imply an interaction of the SN ejecta with matter (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. This suggests that many massive stars may undergo various degrees of envelope stripping shortly before exploding, and produce a considerable diversity in their pre-explosion CSM properties. We explore a generic set of ~100 detailed massive binary evolution models to characterize the amount of envelope stripping and the expected CSM configurations. Our binary models were computed with the MESA stellar evolution code, considering an initial primary star mass of 12.6 Msun, and focus on initial orbital periods above 500 d. We compute these models up to the time of the primary's iron core collapse. We find that Roche lobe overflow often leads to incomplete stripping of the mass donor, resulting in a large variety of pre-SN envelope masses. Many of our models' red supergiant (RSG) donors undergo core collapse during Roche lobe overflow, with mass transfer and thus system mass loss rates of up to 0.01 Msun/yr at that time. The corresponding CSM densities are similar to those inferred for Type IIn SNe like 1998S. In other cases, the mass transfer turns unstable, leading to a common envelope phase at such late time that the mass donor explodes before the common envelope is fully ejected or the system has merged. We argue that this may cause significant pre-SN variability, as for example in SN 2020tlf. Other models suggest a common envelope ejection just centuries before core collapse, which may lead to the strongest interactions, as in superluminous Type IIn SNe like 1994W, or 2006gy. Wide massive binaries offer a natural framework to understand a broad range of hydrogen-rich interacting SNe. On the other hand, the flash features observed in many Type IIP SNe, like in SN 2013fs, may indicate that RSGs are more extended than currently assumed.
