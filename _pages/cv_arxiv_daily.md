2024-10-07, **Neutrino Oscillations in Presence of Diagonal Elements of Scalar NSI: An Analytic Approach**, Dharitree Bezboruah et.al., [2410.05250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05250v1)

 Scalar Non-Standard Interactions (SNSI) in neutrinos can arise when a scalar mediator couples to both neutrinos and standard model fermions. This beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenario is particularly interesting as the SNSI contribution appears as a density-dependent perturbation to the neutrino mass, rather than appearing as a matter-induced potential, and the neutrino oscillation probabilities uniquely depend on the absolute neutrino masses. In this work, we show the complex dependence of the SNSI contributions on the neutrino masses and discuss how the mass of the lightest neutrino would regulate any possible SNSI contribution in both mass ordering scenarios. We derive the analytic expressions for neutrino oscillation probabilities, employing the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, in the presence of diagonal elements of SNSI. The expressions are compact and shows explicit dependence on matter effects and the absolute neutrino masses. The analytic expressions calculated here allow us to obtain the dependence of the SNSI contribution on mass terms of the form $m\_1 + m\_2$, $m\_2 - m\_1$, $m\_1c\_{12}^2 + m\_2s\_{12}^2,$ $ m\_1s\_{12}^2 + m\_2c\_{12}^2$, and $m\_3$. We then explore the non-trivial impact of neutrino mass ordering on the SNSI contribution. The dependence of the SNSI contribution on the 3$\nu$ parameters is then thoroughly explored using our analytic expressions.

2024-10-07, **Long-Time 2D Simulations of Fallback Supernovae: A Systematic Investigation of Explosions Dynamics and Mass Ejections**, Bailey Sykes et.al., [2410.04944v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04944v1)

 We present a set of eight fallback simulations of zero-metallicity progenitors with masses between $60 M\_\odot$ and $95 M\_\odot$. The simulations are computed in 2D with the general relativistic CoCoNuT-FMT code for the first few seconds after black hole formation, and then mapped to the Newtonian code Prometheus for long-duration simulations beyond shock breakout. All simulations produce successful explosions with final energies ranging from $0.41 \times 10^{51}$ erg to $2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg and black hole masses from $20.7 M\_\odot$ to $34.4 M\_\odot$. Explosion energies and remnant masses do not vary monotonically with progenitor mass, but the mass cuts cluster near the outer edge of the helium core. A supplementary model with decreased neutrino heating provides a tentative indication that successful explosions require the shock to reach the sonic point in the infall profile by the time of black hole formation. The propagation of the shock to the surface is only approximately captured by proposed shock invariants, but these may still be sufficient to extrapolate the final black hole mass from the first seconds of evolution. We also discuss potential multi-messenger signatures of the predicted fallback explosions. The enrichment of the ejecta in intermediate mass and iron-group elements varies considerably and is non-neligible for the more powerful explosions. Low-level neutrino emission after black hole formation from these very massive progenitors may be detectable in the case of a Galactic event.

2024-10-07, **Leptogenesis from magnetic helicity of gauged $\text{U}(1)_{B-L}$**, Hajime Fukuda et.al., [2410.04701v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04701v1)

 If the $B-L$ symmetry is gauged with the addition of right-handed neutrinos, the standard model $B-L$ current is anomalous with respect to the $B-L$ gauge field itself. Then, the anomaly relation implies that the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is related to the standard model $B-L$ charges, although the whole universe is $B-L$ neutral with right-handed neutrinos. Based on this, we propose a new leptogenesis scenario with the gauged $B-L$ symmetry as follows. First, the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is generated, e.g., by the axion inflation, together with the standard model and right-handed neutrino $B-L$ charges, with the net $B-L$ charge kept zero. The $B-L$ charges in the standard model and right-handed neutrino sectors are then subject to washout effects from the interactions between them. After the washout effects decouple, the $B-L$ gauge symmetry is Higgsed and the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field decays and generates $B-L$ charges in the both sector; thanks to the washout effects, we obtain a non-zero $B-L$ asymmetry. We show that the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated in this scenario, discussing the decay of the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field and the interactions between the right-handed neutrinos and the standard model particles.

2024-10-07, **Dark Energy, and a Dark Fluid, from topology and a massless spinor**, J. Lorca Espiro et.al., [2410.04999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04999v1)

 Under the existence of a massless spinor degrees of freedom in a spacetime with internal boundaries, such as black holes, we show that a topological mechanism naturally induces terms in the Einstein-Cartan gravitational action that can be interpreted as GR with dark energy and some dark fluid. This can alleviate the problems of dark energy, and perhaps of dark matter. The dark fluid term remains to be further analysed. The topological information is carried by a harmonic 1-form associated to the first co-holomology group of the spacetime, which induces a spacetime contortion acting on the horizontal bundle.

2024-10-07, **Machine Learning Constraints on Dark Matter Annihilation during the Epoch of Reionization: A CNN Analysis of the 21-cm Signal**, Atsushi J. Nishizawa et.al., [2410.04755v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04755v1)

 We explore the impact of dark matter annihilation on the 21-cm signal during the cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization (EoR). Using modified 21cmFAST simulations and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we investigate how energy injected into the intergalactic medium (IGM) through dark matter annihilation affects the evolution of the 21-cm differential brightness temperature. Focusing on two annihilation channels, photon-photon ($\gamma \gamma$) and electron-positron ($e^+e^-$), we examine a broad range of dark matter masses and annihilation cross-sections. Our results show that CNNs outperform traditional power spectrum analysis by effectively distinguishing between subtle differences in simulated 21-cm maps produced by annihilation and non-annihilation scenarios. We also demonstrate that the structure formation boost, driven by dark matter clumping into halos and subhalos, significantly enhances the annihilation signal and alters the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. This enhancement leads to a noticeable effect on the 21-cm signal, including a shift from absorption to emission as dark matter annihilation heats the IGM at lower redshifts. By incorporating observational noise from upcoming radio interferometers, particularly the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we show that these effects remain detectable despite observational challenges. We find that the dark matter annihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the 21-cm signal distinguishable from the non-annihilation scenarios for the dark matter masses $m\_{\rm DM}=100$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of $\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-31}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ ($\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-32}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ for $m\_{\rm DM}=1$ MeV and $\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-24}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ for $m\_{\rm DM}=1$ TeV).

2024-10-07, **Dark matter interpretation of GRB 221009A: a singlet scalar explains LHAASO data**, S. Peyman Zakeri et.al., [2410.04742v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04742v1)

 In this work, we find a new signal of dark matter (DM) through an intensive gamma ray burst (GRB), called GRB 221009A. This indirect detection approach devotes to the decay of DM particles into high energy (HE) photons. In this context, a singlet scalar DM generated at the redshift of the GRB is up-scattered by the high energy cosmic rays (HECRs) during its propagation to Earth. This highly boosted DM then possesses a high flux and undergoes a dominant di-photon decay before reaching the detector. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) probes such energetic gamma rays whereby has recorded a 18 TeV event for the aforementioned GRB.

2024-10-07, **How the HESS J1731-347 event could be explained using $\bf{K^{-}}$ condensation**, M. Veselsky et.al., [2410.05083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05083v1)

 The recent observation of a compact star with a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}\_{-0.17}~{\rm M\_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}\_{-0.78}$ km, located within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, has substantially reinforced the evidence for the presence of exotic matter in neutron stars core. This finding has markedly enhanced our comprehension of the equation of state for dense nuclear matter. In the present work, we investigate the possible existence of a kaon condensation in hadronic neutron stars by employing and comparing two theoretical frameworks: the Relativistic Mean Field model with first order kaon condensate and the Momentum-Dependent Interaction model complemented by chiral effective theory. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the specific event with the inclusion of a kaon condensation in dense nuclear matter. The application of two different models enriches the research, providing insights from the aspect of different theoretical frameworks that accurately predict the existence of HESS J1731-347. In both cases significant insights are extracted for the parameter space of both models, emphasizing to those concerning the nucleon-kaon potential, the threshold density for the appearance of a kaon condensation, as well as the parameter $a\_{3}m\_{s}$ which is related to the strangeness content of the proton. Concluding, the present research indicates that a more systematic investigation of similar events could offer valuable constraints on the properties of dense nuclear matter.
