2024-05-27, **Searching for signatures of new physics in $B \to K \, ν\, \overlineν$ to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos**, C. S. Kim et.al., [2405.17341v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17341v1)

 We conduct a model-independent analysis of the distinct signatures of various generic new physics possibilities in the decay $B \to K \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ by analyzing the branching ratio as well as the missing mass-square distribution. Considering the final neutrinos to be of the same flavor with non-zero mass, we discuss the new physics contributions for both Dirac and Majorana neutrino possibilities. In our study, we utilize the analytical relations among form factors in semi-leptonic $B \to K$ transitions, which are consistent with current lattice QCD predictions to a very high numerical accuracy. We provide constraints on different new physics parameters, taking into account the recent measurement of $B^+ \to K^+ \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ branching ratio by the Belle-II collaboration. In future, if the missing mass-square distribution for $B^+ \to K^+ \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ decay gets reported by Belle-II with analysis of more events than their present data set, one can not only investigate possible new physics effects in these decays, but also probe the Dirac/Majorana nature of the neutrinos using quantum statistics, since a difference between the two cases is known to exist in the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions.

2024-05-27, **Quantum Parity Detectors: a qubit based particle detection scheme with meV thresholds for rare-event searches**, Karthik Ramanathan et.al., [2405.17192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17192v1)

 The next generation of rare-event searches, such as those aimed at determining the nature of particle dark matter or in measuring fundamental neutrino properties, will benefit from particle detectors with thresholds at the meV scale, 100-1000x lower than currently available. Quantum parity detectors (QPDs) are a novel class of proposed quantum devices that use the tremendous sensitivity of superconducting qubits to quasiparticle tunneling events as their detection concept. As envisioned, phonons generated by particle interactions within a crystalline substrate cause an eventual quasiparticle cascade within a surface patterned superconducting qubit element. This process alters the fundamental charge parity of the device in a binary manner, which can be used to deduce the initial properties of the energy deposition. We lay out the operating mechanism, noise sources, and expected sensitivity of QPDs based on a spectrum of charge-qubit types and readout mechanisms and detail an R&D pathway to demonstrating sensitivity to sub-eV energy deposits.

2024-05-27, **Apparent fake neutrino mixture due to seesaw mechanism responsible for oscillation**, Xiao-Yan Wang et.al., [2405.17105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17105v1)

 This paper assumes that neutrino flavor conversion is induced by right-handed neutrino mixture via seesaw mechanism, which leads to apparent fake neutrino mixture with neutrino mass eigenstate consistent with flavor state of left-handed neutrino rather than mixture of flavor state. The transition probability between right-handed neutrinos due to mixture can be explained well by boson intermediating flavor flip interaction between right-handed neutrinos and neutrino oscillation can be considered macro phenomenon before all flavor flip interactions arrive at balance.

2024-05-27, **Complementary Search of Fermionic Absorption Operators at Hadron Collider and Direct Detection Experiments**, Kai Ma et.al., [2405.16878v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16878v1)

 Instead of the energy recoil signal at direct detection experiments, dark matter appears always as missing energy at high energy colliders. For a fermionc dark matter coupled with quarks and neutrino via absorption operators, its production is always accompanied by an invisible neutrino. We study in details the mono-X (photon, jet, and $Z$) productions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). To make easy comparison between the collider and DM direct detection experiments, we start from the quark-level absorption operators for the first time. In other words, we study the model-independent constraints on a generic fermionic absorption dark fermion. In addition, the interplay and comparison with the possible detection at the neutrino experiment especially Borexino is also briefly discussed. We find that for both spin-dependent and spin-independent absorption of the dark matter, the experiments with light nuclear target can provide the strongest constraints.

2024-05-27, **The neutrino force in neutrino backgrounds: Spin dependence and parity-violating effects**, Mitrajyoti Ghosh et.al., [2405.16801v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16801v1)

 The neutrino force results from the exchange of a pair of neutrinos. A neutrino background can significantly influence this force. In this work, we present a comprehensive calculation of the neutrino force in various neutrino backgrounds with spin dependence taken into account. In particular, we calculate the spin-independent and spin-dependent parity-conserving neutrino forces, in addition to the spin-dependent parity-violating neutrino forces with and without the presence of a neutrino background for both isotropic and anisotropic backgrounds. Compared with the vacuum case, the neutrino background can effectively violate Lorentz invariance and lead to additional parity-violating terms that are not suppressed by the velocity of external particles. We estimate the magnitude of the effect of atomic parity-violation experiments, and it turns out to be well below the current experimental sensitivity.

2024-05-27, **EPOCHS Paper X: Environmental effects on Galaxy Formation and Protocluster Galaxy candidates at $4.5<z<10$ from JWST observations**, Qiong Li et.al., [2405.17359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17359v1)

 In this paper we describe our search for galaxy protocluster candidates at $4.5< z < 10$ and explore the environmental and physical properties of their member galaxies identified through JWST wide-field surveys within the CEERS, JADES, and PEARLS NEP-TDF fields. Combining with HST data, we identify 2948 robust $z>4.5$ candidates within an area of 185.4 arcmin$^2$. We determine nearest neighbour statistics and galaxy environments. We find that high-$z$ galaxies in overdense environments exhibit higher star formation activity compared to those in underdense regions. Galaxies in dense environments have a slightly increased SFR at a given mass compared with galaxies in the lower density environments. At the high mass end we also find a gradual flattening of the $M\_{\star}$-SFR slope. We find that galaxies in high-density regions often have redder UV slopes than those in low-density regions, suggesting more dust extinction, weaker Lyman-alpha emission and / or a higher damped Lyman-alpha absorption. We also find that the mass-size relation remains consistent and statistically similar across all environments. Furthermore, we quantitatively assess the probability of a galaxy belonging to a protocluster candidate. In total, we identified 26 overdensities at $z=5-7$ and estimate their dark matter halo masses. We find that all protocluster candidates could evolve into clusters with $M\_{\rm halo} > 10^{14}M\_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$, thereby supporting the theoretical and simulation predictions of cluster formation. Notably, this marks an early search for protocluster candidates in JWST wide field based on photometric data, providing valuable candidates to study cosmic structure formation at the early stages.

2024-05-27, **The response of the inner dark matter halo to stellar bars**, Daniel A. Marostica et.al., [2405.17128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17128v1)

 Barred galaxies constitute about two thirds of observed disc galaxies. Bars affect not only the mass distribution of gas and stars, but also that of the dark matter. An elongation of the inner dark matter halo is known as the halo bar. We aim to characterise the structure of the halo bars, with the goal of correlating them with the properties of the stellar bars. We use a suite of simulated galaxies with various bar strengths, including gas and star formation. We quantify strengths, shapes, and densities of these simulated stellar bars. We carry out numerical experiments with frozen and analytic potentials in order to understand the role played by a live responsive stellar bar. We find that the halo bar generally follows the trends of the disc bar. The strengths of the halo and stellar bars are tightly correlated. Stronger bars induce a slight increase of dark matter density within the inner halo. Numerical experiments show that a non-responsive frozen stellar bar would be capable of inducing a dark matter bar, but it would be weaker than the live case by a factor of roughly two.

2024-05-27, **Exploring the Dark Sector of the Extended FNSM at the LHC**, Amit Chakraborty et.al., [2405.16939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16939v1)

 We establish the possibility of having a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) Dark Matter (DM) candidate in the Froggatt-Nielsen Singlet Model (FNSM) wherein a direct connection exists between the DM mass and flavon symmetry-breaking scale. We find a considerable allowed region of parameter space for the ensuing pseudoscalar DM, which is dependent upon the flavon Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) and Yukawa couplings, over which it may be possible to explain the fermion mass hierarchy. Finally, we choose a Benchmark Point (BP) and perform detailed collider analyses to probe this DM state in the context of Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Specifically, in this model, one obtains large missing transverse energy ($\slashed{E}\_T$) when the DM particle is resonantly produced from the decay of a heavy Higgs field, along with multiple jets from Initial State Radiation (ISR). Thus, the ensuing $\slashed{E}\_T$ + $n\, {\rm jets}~(n \geq 1)$ signature is an excellent probe of DM in this construct.

2024-05-26, **Bounding Dark Energy from the SPARC rotation curves: Data driven probe for galaxy virialization**, David Benisty et.al., [2405.16650v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16650v1)

 Dark Energy (DE) acts as a repulsive force that opposes gravitational attraction. Assuming galaxies maintain a steady state over extended periods, the estimated upper bound on DE studies its resistance to the attractive gravitational force from dark matter. Using the SPARC dataset, we fit the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Hernquist models to identify the most suitable galaxies for these models. Introducing the presence of DE in these galaxies helps establish the upper limit on its repulsive force. This upper bound on DE sits around $\rho\_{\left(<\Lambda\right)} \sim 10^{-25}$~kg/m$^3$, only two orders of magnitude higher than the one measured by Planck. We discuss the conditions for detecting DE in different systems and show the consistency of the upper bound from galaxies to other systems. The upper bound is of the same order of magnitude as $\rho\_{200} = 200 \rho\_c$ for both dark matter profiles. We also address the implications for future measurements on that upper bound and the condition for detecting the impact of $\Lambda$ on galactic scales.

2024-05-26, **Accurate Measurement of the Lensing Magnification by BOSS CMASS Galaxies and Its Implications for Cosmology and Dark Matter**, Kun Xu et.al., [2405.16484v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16484v1)

 Magnification serves as an independent and complementary gravitational lensing measurement to shear. We develop a novel method to achieve an accurate and robust magnification measurement around BOSS CMASS galaxies across physical scales of $0.016h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc} < r\_{\rm p} < 10h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. We first measure the excess total flux density $\delta M$ of the source galaxies in deep DECaLS photometric catalog that are lensed by CMASS galaxies. We convert $\delta M$ to magnification $\mu$ by establishing the $\delta \mu-\delta M$ relation using a deeper photometric sample. By comparing magnification measurements in three optical bands ($grz$), we constrain the dust attenuation curve and its radial distribution, discovering a steep attenuation curve in the circumgalactic medium of CMASS galaxies. We further compare dust-corrected magnification measurements to model predictions from high-resolution dark matter-only (DMO) simulations in WMAP and Planck cosmologies, as well as the hydrodynamic simulation TNG300-1, using precise galaxy-halo connections from the Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs method and the accurate ray-tracing algorithm P3MLens. For $r\_{\rm p} > 70h^{-1}\,$kpc, our magnification measurements are in good agreement with both WMAP and Planck cosmologies. Assuming a linear correlation between the magnification signal and the fluctuation amplitude $S\_8$, we obtain a tight constraint of $S\_8 = 0.816 \pm 0.024$. However, at $r\_{\rm p} < 70h^{-1}\,$kpc, we observe an excess magnification signal, which is higher than the DMO model in Planck cosmology at $2.8\sigma$ and would be exacerbated if significant baryon feedback is included. Implications of the potential small scale discrepancy for the nature of dark matter and for the processes governing galaxy formation are discussed.

2024-05-27, **Cosmological constraints on curved quintessence**, Sukannya Bhattacharya et.al., [2405.17396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17396v1)

 Dynamical dark energy has gained renewed interest due to recent theoretical and observational developments. In the present paper, we focus on a string-motivated dark energy set-up, and perform a detailed cosmological analysis of exponential quintessence with potential $V=V\_0 e^{-\lambda\phi}$, allowing for non-zero spatial curvature. We first gain some physical intuition into the full evolution of such a scenario by analysing the corresponding dynamical system. Then, we test the model using a combination of Planck CMB data, DESI BAO data, as well as recent supernovae datasets. For the model parameter $\lambda$, we obtain a preference for nonzero values: $\lambda = 0.48^{+0.28}\_{-0.21},\; 0.68^{+0.31}\_{-0.20},\; 0.77^{+0.18}\_{-0.15}$ at 68% C.L. when combining CMB+DESI with Pantheon+, Union3 and DES-Y5 supernovae datasets respectively. We find no significant hint for spatial curvature. We discuss the implications of current cosmological results for the exponential quintessence model, and more generally for dark energy in string theory.

2024-05-27, **Supernova Remnants in Gamma Rays**, Andrea Giuliani et.al., [2405.17384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17384v1)

 In the 1960s, the remnants of supernova explosions (SNRs) were indicated as a possible source of galactic cosmic rays through the Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) mechanism. Since then, the observation of gamma-ray emission from relativistic ions in these objects has been one of the main goals of high-energy astrophysics. A few dozen SNRs have been detected at GeV and TeV photon energies in the last two decades. However, these observations have shown a complex phenomenology that is not easy to reduce to the standard paradigm based on DSA acceleration. Although the understanding of these objects has greatly increased, and their nature as efficient electron and proton accelerators has been observed, it remains to be clarified whether these objects are the main contributors to galactic cosmic rays. Here, we review the observations of {\gamma}-ray emission from SNRs and the perspectives for the future.

2024-05-27, **Standardizing the Gamma-ray burst as a standard candle and applying to the cosmological probes: constraints on the two-component dark energy model**, Jia-Lun Li et.al., [2405.17010v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17010v1)

 As one of the most energetic and brightest events, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been used as a standard candle for cosmological probe. Based on the relevant features of GRBs light curves, a plateau phase followed a decay phase, we obtain X-ray samples of 31 GRBs and optical samples of 50 GRBs, which are thought to be caused by the same physical mechanism. We standardize GRBs using the two-dimension fundamental plane relation of the rest-frame luminosity of the plateau emission ($L\_{b,z}$) and the end time of plateau ($T\_{b,z}$) $L\_{b,z}-T\_{b,z}$, as well as the three-dimension fundamental plane correlation including the peak energy ($E\_{p,i}$) $L\_{b,z}-T\_{b,z}-E\_{p,i}$. For the cosmological probes, we consider the $\omega$CDM model in which the dark energy consists of one component, and mainly focus on the $X\_1X\_2$CDM model in which the dark energy is made up of two independent components. We obtain the constraints on the related parameters of the cosmological models using the type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data and selected X-ray and optical samples. For the $X\_1X\_2$CDM model, we find that the values of the equations of state parameters of two dark energies, $\omega\_1$ and $\omega\_2$, are very close. We also conduct the comparison between the models using the Bayesian information criterion, and find that the $\omega$CDM model is favoured.
