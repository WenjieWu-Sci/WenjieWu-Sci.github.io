2024-11-19, **Nucleon relativistic weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions**, Yi Chen et.al., [2411.12521v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12521v1)

 Relativistic full weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions inside a general spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system are systematically studied for the first time, where the second-class current contribution associated with the induced (pseudo-)tensor form factor (FF) is included. For experimental measurements, we explicitly derive the first exact full tree-level unpolarized differential cross sections of both (anti)neutrino-nucleon and (anti)neutrino-antinucleon elastic scatterings. We clearly demonstrate that the 3D axial charge distribution in the Breit frame, being purely imaginary and parity-odd, is in fact related to the induced (pseudo-)tensor FF $G\_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than the axial FF $G\_A^Z(Q^2)$. We study the frame-dependence of full axial-vector four-current distributions for a moving system, and compared them with their light-front counterparts. We clarify the role played by Melosh rotations, and classify the origin of distortions in light-front distributions into three key sources using the lemma that we have proposed and verified in this work. In particular, we show that the second-class current contribution, although explicitly included, does not contribute in fact to the mean-square axial and spin radii. We finally illustrate our results in the case of a proton using the weak-neutral axial-vector FFs extracted from experimental data.

2024-11-19, **Neutrino Oscillation Tomography of the Earth with the Hyper-Kamiokande Detector**, César Jesús-Valls et.al., [2411.12344v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12344v1)

 Using PREM as a reference model for the Earth density distribution we investigate the sensitivity of Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) detector to deviations of the Earth i) core average density $\bar{\rho}\_C$, ii) lower mantle average density $\bar{\rho}\_{lman}$) and iii) upper mantle average density $\bar{\rho}\_{uman}$, from their respective PREM densities. The analysis is performed by studying the effects of the Earth matter on the oscillations of atmospheric $\nu\_{\mu}$, $\nu\_e$, $\bar{\nu}\_\mu$ and $\bar{\nu}\_e$. We implement the constraints on the variations of $\rho\_C$, $\rho\_{lman}$ and $\rho\_{uman}$ following from the precise knowledge of the Earth mass $M\_\oplus$ and moment of inertia $I\_\oplus$, as well as from the requirement that the Earth be in hydrostatic equilibrium (EHE). These constraints limit in the case of the three layer Earth density structure we are considering the maximal positive deviation of $\bar{\rho}\_C$ from its PREM value to $10\%$. Considering the case of normal ordering (NO) of neutrino masses, we present results which illustrate the dependence of sensitivity to the core, lower and upper mantle average densities on the energy and zenith angle resolutions, on whether or not the prospective systematic errors are accounted for and on the value of $\theta\_{23}$. We show, that in the ``nominal'' case of neutrino energy resolution $E\_{res} = 30\%$ and zenith angle resolution $\theta\_{zres} = 20^\circ$ and for, $\sin^2\theta\_{23}=0.45~(0.58)$, HK can determine the average core density $\bar{\rho}\_C$ at $2\sigma$ C.L. after 6500 days of operation with an uncertainty of (-14.5\%)/+39.5\% ((-9.3\%/+31.7\%). In the ``more favorable'' case of $E\_{res}= 20\%$ and $\theta\_{zres} = 10^\circ$, and if $\sin^2\theta\_{23}=0.58~(0.45)$, the core density would be determined at $2\sigma$ C.L. with an uncertainty of (-8.3\%)/+9.8\% ((-9.2\%)/+11.3\%).

2024-11-19, **Estimating Dark Matter Halo Masses in Simulated Galaxy Clusters with Graph Neural Networks**, Nikhil Garuda et.al., [2411.12629v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12629v1)

 Galaxies grow and evolve in dark matter halos. Because dark matter is not visible, galaxies' halo masses ($\rm{M}\_{\rm{halo}}$) must be inferred indirectly. We present a graph neural network (GNN) model for predicting $\rm{M}\_{\rm{halo}}$ from stellar mass ($\rm{M}\_{*}$) in simulated galaxy clusters using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Unlike traditional machine learning models like random forests, our GNN captures the information-rich substructure of galaxy clusters by using spatial and kinematic relationships between galaxy neighbour. A GNN model trained on the TNG-Cluster dataset and independently tested on the TNG300 simulation achieves superior predictive performance compared to other baseline models we tested. Future work will extend this approach to different simulations and real observational datasets to further validate the GNN model's ability to generalise.

2024-11-19, **Halo Spin Dependence on Environment for HI-bearing galaxies**, Zichen Hua et.al., [2411.12211v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12211v1)

 Leveraging the semi-analytic method, we compute halo spins for a substantial sample of HI-bearing galaxies observed in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey. Our statistical analysis reveals a correlation between halo spin and environment, although the trend is subtle. On average, galaxies exhibit a decreasing halo spin tendency in denser environments. This observation contrasts with previous results from $N$-body simulations in the Lambda cold dark matter framework. The discrepancy may be attributed to environmental gas stripping, leading to an underestimation of halo spins in galaxies in denser environments, or to baryonic processes that significantly alter the original dark matter halo spins, deviating from previous $N$-body simulation findings.

2024-11-19, **The direct measurement of gravitational potential decay rate at cosmological scales II -- Improved dark energy constraint from $z\le1.4$**, Fuyu Dong et.al., [2411.12594v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12594v1)

 The gravitational potential decay rate (DR) is caused by the cosmic acceleration of the universe, providing a direct probe into the existence of dark energy (DE). We present measurements of DR and explore its implications for DE models using the Data Release 9 galaxy catalog of DESI imaging surveys and the Planck cosmic microwave background maps. Our analysis includes six redshift bins within the range of $0.2\le z<1.4$ and achieves a total significance of 3.1$\sigma$, extending the DR measurements to a much higher redshift comparing to Dong et al. (2022), which focused on $0.2\le z<0.8$. Other improvements involve addressing potential systematics in the DR-related measurements of correlation functions, including imaging systematics and magnification bias. We explore the constraining power of DR both the $w$CDM model and the $w\_0w\_a$CDM model. We find that, the addition of DR can significantly improves DE constraints, over Sloan Digital Sky Survey baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data alone or PantheonPlus supernovae (SNe) compilation alone, although it shows only a modest improvement for DESI BAO. In the $w$CDM model, all three probes-DR, DESI BAO and SNe-favor $w=-1$. For the $w\_0w\_a$CDM, while DESI BAO prefers $w\_0>-1$ and $w\_a<0$, SNe Ia and DR data constrain $w\_0=-0.94^{+0.11}\_{-0.13}$ and $w\_a=-0.22^{+0.57}\_{-0.97}$. Namely SNe Ia and DR data has no preference on dynamical dark energy over $\Lambda$.

2024-11-19, **Measuring the expansion velocities of broad-line Ic supernovae: An investigation of neglected sources of error in two popular methods**, Gabriel Finneran et.al., [2411.12574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12574v1)

 The velocities of Ic-BL supernovae can be determined using two techniques (spline fitting and template fitting), sometimes resulting in different velocities for the same event. This work compares and contrasts both methods, identifying sources of error which are not accounted for by most authors and quantifying their impact on the final velocity measurement. Finally, it identifies the cause of velocity discrepancies for events measured using both methods. We quantified the impact of pre-smoothing the spectra prior to use of both methods using two well-sampled cases. To identify the source of velocity discrepancies, two cases were measured and directly compared. Additional sources of error for template fitting arise due to the choice of phase of the template spectrum ($\sim$1000 km/s) and smoothing of the input spectrum ($\sim$500 km/s). The impact of phase shifts is minimised at peak time. The spline fitting method tends to underestimate uncertainties by around 1000 km/s. This method can also be impacted by fine tuning of the smoothing parameters ($\sim$500-1000 km/s). Optimum smoothing parameters for different cases are presented along with suggestions for best practice. Direct comparison of both methods showed that velocity discrepancies are not always present, debunking the claim that the template fitting method always handles blending better than spline fitting. Spline fitting seems to struggle to handle blending only in cases where the Fe II features are superimposed on a red continuum, which biases the minimum of this feature towards the bluest line of the triplet, creating an artificially higher velocity. This situation may be relatively rare among Ic-BLs, based on typical temperature evolution. Both methods can be applied under certain circumstances with similar results. The morphology of the velocity evolution of an SN appears to be the same regardless of the method used.

2024-11-19, **Assessing Matched Filtering for Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational-Wave Detection**, Haakon Andresen et.al., [2411.12524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12524v1)

 Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae are a promising yet challenging target for detection due to the stochastic and complex nature of these signals. Conventional detection methods for core-collapse supernovae rely on excess energy searches because matched filtering has been hindered by the lack of well-defined waveform templates. However, numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae have improved our understanding of the gravitational wave signals they emit, which enables us, for the first time, to construct a set of templates that closely resemble predictions from numerical simulations. In this study, we investigate the possibility of detecting gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae using a matched-filtering methods. We construct a theoretically-informed template bank and use it to recover a core-collapse supernova signal injected into real LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector data. We evaluate the detection efficiency of the matched-filtering approach and how well the injected signal is reconstructed. We discuss the false alarm rate of our approach and investigate the main source of false triggers. We recover 88\% of the signals injected at a distance of 1 kpc and 50% of the signals injected at 2 kpc. For more than 50% of the recovered events, the underlying signal characteristics are reconstructed within an error of 15%. We discuss the strengths and limitations of this approach and identify areas for further improvements to advance the potential of matched filtering for supernova gravitational-wave detection. We also present the open-source Python package SynthGrav used to generate the template bank.

2024-11-19, **Kinetic tomography of the Galactic plane within 1.25 kiloparsecs from the Sun. The interstellar flows revealed by HI and CO line emission and 3D dust**, J. D. Soler et.al., [2411.12257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12257v1)

 We present a reconstruction of the line-of-sight motions of the local interstellar medium (ISM) based on the combination of a state-of-the-art model of the three-dimensional dust density distribution within 1.25 kpc from the Sun and the HI and CO line emission within Galactic latitudes $\|b\| < 5^{\circ}$. We use the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) method to match the plane-of-the-sky 3D dust distribution across distances with the atomic and molecular line emission. We identify a significant correlation between the 3D dust model and the line emission. We employ this correlation to assign line-of-sight velocities to the dust across density channels and produce a face-on map of the local ISM radial motions with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR). We find that most of the material in the 3D dust model follows the large-scale pattern of Galactic rotation; however, we also report local departures from the rotation pattern with standard deviations of 12.1 and 6.1 km/s for the HI and CO line emission, respectively. The mean kinetic energy densities of these streaming motions are around 0.68 and 0.18 eV/cm$^{3}$ from either gas tracer. Assuming homogeneity and isotropy in the velocity field, these values are within a factor of a few of the total kinetic energy density. These kinetic energy values are roughly comparable to other energy densities, thus confirming the near-equipartition introduced by the feedback loops connecting the physical processes in the local ISM. Yet, we find energy and momentum overdensities of around a factor of ten concentrated in the Radcliffe Wave, the Split, and other local density structures. Although we do not find evidence of the Local Spiral Arm impact in these overdensities, their distribution suggests the influence of other large-scale effects that, in addition to supernova feedback, shape the energy distribution in the Solar neighborhood.
