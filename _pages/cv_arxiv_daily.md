2023-09-19, **Neutrino Imaging of the Galactic Centre and Millisecond Pulsar Population**, Paul C. W. Lai et.al., [2309.10493v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10493v1)

 In this work, we consider the possible presence of a large population of millisecond pulsars in the Galactic Centre. Their direct detection would be challenging due to severe pulse broadening caused by scattering of radiation. We propose a new method to constrain their population with neutrino imaging of the Galactic Centre. Millisecond pulsars are proposed cosmic-ray accelerators. The high-energy protons they produce will collide with the baryonic matter in the central molecular zone to create charged and neutral pions that decay into neutrinos and $\gamma$-rays, respectively. The specific neutrino and $\gamma$-ray fluxes must be below their corresponding observed values, allowing us to put a conservative upper limit on the millisecond pulsar population of N\_MSP < 10,000 within a galacto-centric radius of 20 pc. This upper limit is sensitive to the proton acceleration efficiency of the pulsars, but is less dependent on the particle injection spectral index and the choice of mass tracers. The population will be better constrained when high resolution neutrino observations of the Galactic Centre become available. The presence of these millisecond pulsars can account for the $\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic Centre.

2023-09-19, **Investigating the fluxes and physics potential of LHC neutrino experiments**, Felix Kling et.al., [2309.10417v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10417v1)

 The initiation of a novel neutrino physics program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the purpose-built Forward Physics Facility (FPF) proposal have motivated studies exploring the discovery potential of these searches. This requires resolving degeneracies between new predictions and uncertainties in modeling neutrino production in the forward kinematic region. The present work investigates a broad selection of existing predictions for the parent hadron spectra at FASER$\nu$ and the FPF to parameterize expected correlations in the neutrino spectra produced in their decays and to determine the highest achievable precision for their observation based on Fisher information. This allows for setting constraints on various physics processes within and beyond the Standard Model, including neutrino non-standard interactions. We also illustrate how combining multiple neutrino observables could lead to experimental confirmation of the enhanced-strangeness scenario proposed to resolve the cosmic-ray muon puzzle already during the ongoing LHC Run 3.

2023-09-18, **Neutrinos from Earth-Bound Dark Matter Annihilation**, Maxim Pospelov et.al., [2309.10032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10032v1)

 A sub-component of dark matter with a short collision length compared to a planetary size leads to efficient accumulation of dark matter in astrophysical bodies. We analyze possible neutrino signal from the annihilation of such dark matter and conclude that in the optically thick regime for dark matter capture, the Earth provides the largest neutrino flux. Using the results of the existing searches, we consider two scenarios for neutrino flux, from stopped mesons and prompt higher-energy neutrinos. In both cases we exclude some previously unexplored parts of the parameter space (dark matter mass, its abundance, and the scattering cross section on nuclei) by recasting the existing neutrino searches.

2023-09-18, **Analysis of $b\rightarrow cτ\barν_τ$ anomalies using weak effective Hamiltonian with complex couplings**, Muhammad Arslan et.al., [2309.09929v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09929v1)

 Recently, the experimental measurements of the branching ratios and different polarization asymmetries for the processes occurring through flavor-changing-charged current b\rightarrow c\tau\overline{\nu}\_{\tau} transitions by BABAR, Belle, and LHCb show some sparkling differences with the corresponding SM predictions. Assuming the left handed neutrinos, we add the dimension-six vector, (pseudo-)scalar, and tensor operators with complex WCs to the SM WEH. Together with 60%, 30% and 10% constraints coming from the branching ratio of B\_{c}\to\tau\bar{\nu}\_{\tau}, we analyze the parametric space of these new physics WCs accommodating the current anomalies in the purview of the most recent HFLAV data of R\_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D\right), R\_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^*\right) and Belle data of F\_{L}\left(D^*\right) and P\_{\tau}\left(D^*\right). Furthermore, we derive the sum rules which correlate these observables with R\_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D\right) and R\_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^*\right). Using the best-fit points of the new complex WCs along with the latest measurements of R\_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^{(*)}\right), we predict the numerical values of the observable R\_{\tau/\ell}\left(\Lambda\_c\right), R\_{\tau/\mu}\left(J/\psi\right) and R\_{\tau/\ell}\left(X\_c\right) from the sum rules. Apart from finding the correlation matrix among the observables under consideration, we plot them graphically which is useful to discriminate different NP scenarios. Finally, we study the impact of these NP couplings on various angular and the CP triple product asymmetries, that could be measured in some ongoing and future experiments. The precise measurements of these observables are important to check the SM and extract the possible NP.

2023-09-18, **Detecting High-Energy Neutrinos from Galactic Supernovae with ATLAS**, Alex Y. Wen et.al., [2309.09771v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09771v1)

 We show that ATLAS, a collider detector, can measure the flux of high-energy supernova neutrinos, which can be produced from days to months after the explosion. Using Monte Carlo simulations for predicted fluxes, we find at most $\mathcal{O}(0.1-1)$ starting events and $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ throughgoing events from a supernova 10 kpc away. Possible Galactic supernovae from Betelgeuse and Eta Carinae are further analyzed as demonstrative examples. We argue that even with limited statistics, ATLAS has the ability to discriminate among flavors and between neutrinos and antineutrinos, making it an unique neutrino observatory so far unmatched in this capability.

2023-09-18, **Calibrating baryonic feedback with weak lensing and fast radio bursts**, Robert Reischke et.al., [2309.09766v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09766v1)

 One of the key limitations of large-scale structure surveys of the current and future generation, such as Euclid, LSST-Rubin or Roman, is the influence of feedback processes on the distribution of matter in the Universe. This effect, called baryonic feedback, modifies the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales much stronger than any cosmological parameter of interest. Constraining these modifications is therefore key to unlock the full potential of the upcoming surveys, and we propose to do so with the help of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). FRBs are short, astrophysical radio transients of extragalactic origin. Their burst signal is dispersed by the free electrons in the large-scale-structure, leading to delayed arrival times at different frequencies characterised by the dispersion measure (DM). Since the dispersion measure is sensitive to the integrated line-of-sight electron density, it is a direct probe of the baryonic content of the Universe. We investigate how FRBs can break the degeneracies between cosmological and feedback parameters by correlating the observed Dispersion Measure with the weak gravitational lensing signal of a Euclid-like survey. In particular we use a simple one-parameter model controlling baryonic feedback, but we expect similar findings for more complex models. Within this model we find that $\sim 10^4$ FRBs are sufficient to constrain the baryonic feedback 10 times better than cosmic shear alone. Breaking this degeneracy will tighten the constraints considerably, for example we expect a factor of two improvement on the sum of neutrino masses

2023-09-18, **Monstrous Higgs and Leech Spacetime**, Seyed M. F. Khaki et.al., [2309.09762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09762v1)

 Initial results of studying the de Sitter space dual to the Monster CFT are announced. It is reported that the boson of the underlying scalar field in the ground state of the untwisted sector is precisely as heavy as the Higgs boson and the vacuum energy of the twisted sector coincides with the Cosmological constant. Further, the Planck mass and the GUT scale are calculated almost exactly, all in a simple framework of the finite fields. In light of these and other observations, it is proposed that the origin of mass is very likely the sporadic groups and the fabric of spacetime is most probably the Leech lattice. The proposed model predicts a globally flat and locally 3D de Sitter space (globally 3D and locally 4D spacetime) as well as two origins of mass, one for the Higgs boson and one for the neutrinos.

2023-09-18, **The LHC as a Neutrino-Ion Collider**, Juan M. Cruz-Martinez et.al., [2309.09581v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09581v1)

 Proton-proton collisions at the LHC generate a high-intensity collimated beam of neutrinos in the forward (beam) direction, characterised by energies of up to several TeV. The recent observation of LHC neutrinos by FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC signals that this hitherto ignored particle beam is now available for scientific inquiry. Here we quantify the impact that neutrino deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements at the LHC would have on the parton distributions (PDFs) of protons and heavy nuclei. We generate projections for DIS structure functions for FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC at Run III, as well as for the FASER$\nu$2, AdvSND, and FLArE experiments to be hosted at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF) operating concurrently with the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). We determine that up to one million electron- and muon-neutrino DIS interactions within detector acceptance can be expected by the end of the HL-LHC, covering a kinematic region in $x$ and $Q^2$ overlapping with that of the Electron-Ion Collider. Including these DIS projections into global (n)PDF analyses, specifically PDF4LHC21, NNPDF4.0, and EPPS21, reveals a significant reduction of PDF uncertainties, in particular for strangeness and the up and down valence PDFs. We show that LHC neutrino data enables improved theoretical predictions for core processes at the HL-LHC, such as Higgs and weak gauge boson production. Our analysis demonstrates that exploiting the LHC neutrino beam effectively provides CERN with a "Neutrino-Ion Collider" without requiring modifications in its accelerator infrastructure.

2023-09-19, **Atmospheric Temperature anomalies as manifestation of the dark Universe**, K. Zioutas et.al., [2309.10779v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10779v1)

 We are investigating the possible origin of small-scale anomalies, like the annual stratospheric temperature anomalies. Unexpectedly within known physics, their observed planetary "dependency", does not match concurrent solar activity, whose impact on the atmosphere is unequivocal; this points at an additional energy source of exo-solar origin. A viable concept behind such observations is based on possible gravitational focusing by the Sun and its planets towards the Earth of low-speed invisible streaming matter; its influx towards the Earth gets temporally enhanced. Only a somehow "strongly" interacting invisible streaming matter with the small upper atmospheric screening can be behind the observed temperature excursions. Ordinary dark matter (DM) candidates like axions or WIMPs, cannot have any noticeable impact. The associated energy deposition is $\mathcal{O}(\sim 1000\, \mathrm{GeV}/{{\mathrm{cm}}^2}/\mathrm{sec})$. The atmosphere has been uninterruptedly monitored for decades. Therefore, the upper atmosphere can serve as a novel (low-threshold) detector for the dark Universe, with built-in spatiotemporal resolution while the solar system gravity acts temporally as a signal amplifier. Interestingly, the anomalous ionosphere shows a relationship with the inner earth activity like earthquakes. Similarly investigating the transient sudden stratospheric warmings within the same reasoning, the nature of the assumed "invisible streams" could be deciphered.

2023-09-19, **Impact of a nearby subhalo on the constraint of dark matter annihilation from cosmic ray antiprotons**, Yi Zhao et.al., [2309.10754v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10754v1)

 Numerous simulations indicate that a large number of subhalos should be hosted by the Milky Way. The potential existence of a nearby subhalo could have important implications for our understanding of dark matter (DM) annihilation. In this study, we investigate the hypothetical presence of a nearby subhalo and set the upper limits on the DM annihilation cross section by analyzing the cosmic-ray antiproton spectrum. By presenting the ratios of annihilation cross section limits for scenarios with and without a nearby subhalo, we can quantitatively evaluate the potential impact of the nearby subhalo on the limits of the DM annihilation cross section. The impacts of the concentration model and the subhalo probability distribution have been considered. We explore the antiproton contribution of the potential nearby DM subhalo accounting for the DAMPE $e^\pm$ spectrum at $\sim 1.4$ TeV and find that the current AMS-02 antiproton results do not place the constraint on this contribution.

2023-09-19, **Opening the Higgs Portal to Lepton-Flavoured Dark Matter**, Harun Acaroğlu et.al., [2309.10700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10700v1)

 We study a simplified model of lepton-flavoured complex scalar dark matter coupling to right-handed leptons and the Higgs boson. The model is set up in the Dark Minimal Flavour Violation framework. In contrast to previous studies of similar models we consider the most general case and do not a priori constrain the hierarchy of dark matter masses and couplings in any way. In the first part of the analysis we discuss the impact of Higgs portal interactions and the generalised mass hierarchy on the model's phenomenology. We find that they render new physics masses around the electroweak scale viable, thus qualifying this model to address the $(g-2)\_\mu$ puzzle. After reviewing the current situation of the latter, we perform two combined analyses -- one in which $(g-2)\_\mu$ allows for significant new physics effects and one in which it does not. We find that while the latter scenario allows for a larger range of new physics scales, both scenarios are equally viable.

2023-09-19, **Origin and characterization of single-electron events in Skipper-CCDs for light dark matter searches**, Mariano Cababie et.al., [2309.10458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10458v1)

 This manuscript summarizes the work carried out within the SENSEI (Sub-Electron-Noise Skipper-CCD Experimental Instrument) collaboration, an effort focused on the search for light dark matter using Skipper-CCDs. Firstly, it presents the data acquisition and processing protocol developed to establish a selection criteria for events compatible with the dark matter signal. This protocol also enabled the structure and tools used for the study and characterization of phenomena that impact the quality of measurements made in the search for dark matter (measurement of the Fano factor, determination of the Compton background, and characterization of the high-energy surface background), which were carried out during this work. Secondly, it discusses the comprehensive study conducted on the origin of single-electron events in Skipper-CCDs, which allowed for the selection of detector operating parameters and improved the detection sensitivity in the search for dark matter. It is highlighted the characterization of the spatial correlation between single-electron events and high-energy events, among other developed event selection criteria, and the optimization of the output device to reduce sources of luminescence during its operation. As a result of this study, the lowest levels of dark current and spurious charge ever measured in a CCD are reported. Finally, the latest published results from SENSEI are presented. The obtained limits for the scattering of a light mediator are the best reported to date across the entire investigated mass range, while for the heavy mediator, they are the best for masses below 10 MeV. In terms of dark matter absorption, the most restringent limits below 10 eV are reported. These results, achieved with only a very small fraction of the total projected exposure for SENSEI, position Skipper-CCDs as leaders in the search for light dark matter worldwide.

2023-09-19, **An N-body/hydrodynamical simulation study of the merging cluster El Gordo: a compelling case for SIDM ?**, R. Valdarnini et.al., [2309.10374v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10374v1)

 We use a large set N-body/hydrodynamical simulations to study the physical properties of the merging cluster El Gordo. We found that the observed X-ray structures, along with other data, can be fairly matched by simulations with collision velocities 2,000 kms <= V <= 2,500 kms and impact parameters 600 kpc <= P <= 800 kpc. The mass of the primary is constrained to be between 10^{15} M\_sun and ~ 1.6 10^{15} M\_sun, in accord with recent lensing-based mass measurements. Moreover, a returning, post-apocenter, scenario is not supported by our head-on simulations. We also consider merger models that incorporate dark matter self-interactions. The simulation results show that the observed spatial offsets between the different mass components are well reproduced in self-interacting dark matter models with an elastic cross-section in the range \sigma\_DM/m\_X ~ 4 -5 cm^2/gr. In addition, the mean relative line-of-sight radial velocity between the two brightest cluster galaxies is found to be of the order of several hundreds of km/s. We argue that these findings provide an unambiguous signature of a dark matter behavior that exhibits collisional properties in a very energetic high-redshift cluster collision. The range of allowed values we found for sigma\_DM/m\_X is however inconsistent with present upper limits. To resolve this tension we suggest the possibility that the self-interacting dark matter model used here should be considered as only a low order approximation, and that the underlying physical processes that describe the interaction of dark matter in major cluster mergers are more complex than can be adequately represented by the commonly assumed approach based on scattering of dark matter particles.

2023-09-19, **Is it possible to separate baryonic from dark matter within the $Λ$-CDM formalism?**, A. Borowiec et.al., [2309.10364v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10364v1)

 We found general solutions of matter stress-energy (non-)conservation in scalar-tensor FLRW-type cosmological models by extending the logotropic formalism to the case of non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and new dark fluid candidates. The energy conditions expressed by the generating function are introduced. Next, we investigate the possibility of separating baryonic from dark matter and explain their ratio as a chameleon effect in the presence of non-minimal coupling. To answer the question affirmatively we analyze simple extensions of $\Lambda$-CDM model by adding a non-minimally coupled scalar field in the Einstein frame. Two scenarios involving either a scalaron (quintessence) or a phantom (ghost) are numerically solved and compared. As a result, it is shown that in both cases LCDM can be reproduced with a high accuracy in the region covered by observations. As expected, in the case of the ghost field Big-Bang scenario is replaced by Big-Bounce.

2023-09-19, **Hybrid SBI or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Learn the Likelihood**, Chirag Modi et.al., [2309.10270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10270v1)

 We propose a new framework for the analysis of current and future cosmological surveys, which combines perturbative methods (PT) on large scales with conditional simulation-based implicit inference (SBI) on small scales. This enables modeling of a wide range of statistics across all scales using only small-volume simulations, drastically reducing computational costs, and avoids the assumption of an explicit small-scale likelihood. As a proof-of-principle for this hybrid simulation-based inference (HySBI) approach, we apply it to dark matter density fields and constrain cosmological parameters using both the power spectrum and wavelet coefficients, finding promising results that significantly outperform classical PT methods. We additionally lay out a roadmap for the next steps necessary to implement HySBI on actual survey data, including consideration of bias, systematics, and customized simulations. Our approach provides a realistic way to scale SBI to future survey volumes, avoiding prohibitive computational costs.

2023-09-18, **Applying Machine Learning Techniques to Searches for Lepton-Partner Pair-Production with Intermediate Mass Gaps at the Large Hadron Collider**, Bhaskar Dutta et.al., [2309.10197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10197v1)

 We consider the application of machine learning techniques to searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for pair-produced lepton partners which decay to leptons and invisible particles. This scenario can arise in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), but can be realized in many other extensions of the Standard Model (SM). We focus on the case of intermediate mass splitting ($\sim 30$ GeV) between the dark matter (DM) and the scalar. For these mass splittings, the LHC has made little improvement over LEP due to large electroweak backgrounds. We find that the use of machine learning techniques can push the LHC well past discovery sensitivity for a benchmark model with a lepton partner mass of $\sim 110$ GeV, for an integrated luminosity of $300~{\rm fb}^{-1}$, with a signal-to-background ratio of $\sim 0.3$. The LHC could exclude models with a lepton partner mass as large as $\sim 160$ GeV with the same luminosity. The use of machine learning techniques in searches for scalar lepton partners at the LHC could thus definitively probe the parameter space of the MSSM in which scalar muon mediated interactions between SM muons and Majorana singlet DM can both deplete the relic density through dark matter annihilation and satisfy the recently measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We identify several machine learning techniques which can be useful in other LHC searches involving large and complex backgrounds.

2023-09-18, **The One-hundred-deg^2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN): Survey Design and Science Goals**, Kyoung-Soo Lee et.al., [2309.10191v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10191v1)

 We describe the survey design and science goals for ODIN (One-hundred-deg^2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands), a NOIRLab survey using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to obtain deep (AB~25.7) narrow-band images over an unprecedented area of sky. The three custom-built narrow-band filters, N419, N501, and N673, have central wavelengths of 419, 501, and 673 nm and respective full-widthat-half-maxima of 7.2, 7.4, and 9.8 nm, corresponding to Lya at z=2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 and cosmic times of 2.8, 2.1, and 1.4 Gyr, respectively. When combined with even deeper, public broad-band data from Hyper Suprime-Cam, DECam, and in the future, LSST, the ODIN narrow-band images will enable the selection of over 100,000 Lya-emitting (LAE) galaxies at these epochs. ODIN-selected LAEs will identify protoclusters as galaxy overdensities, and the deep narrow-band images enable detection of highly extended Lya blobs (LABs). Primary science goals include measuring the clustering strength and dark matter halo connection of LAEs, LABs, and protoclusters, and their respective relationship to filaments in the cosmic web. The three epochs allow the redshift evolution of these properties to be determined during the period known as Cosmic Noon, where star formation was at its peak. The two narrow-band filter wavelengths are designed to enable interloper rejection and further scientific studies by revealing [O II] and [O III] at z=0.34, Lya and He II 1640 at z=3.1, and Lyman continuum plus Lya at z=4.5. Ancillary science includes similar studies of the lower-redshift emission-line galaxy samples and investigations of nearby star-forming galaxies resolved into numerous [O III] and [S II] emitting regions.

2023-09-18, **Dark Matter searches in Dwarf Galaxies with the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory**, Micael Andrade et.al., [2309.10102v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10102v1)

 Dark matter is thought to make up most of the matter density of the Universe, yet its true nature remains uncertain. Among dark matter theories, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are a prominent candidate for dark matter because they can reproduce the observed abundance of dark matter in the universe. There are various methods for searching for WIMPs, one of which is indirect detection, which involves looking for the Standard Model particles produced by the decay or self-annihilation of dark matter particles. Within the mass range of GeV to PeV for the dark matter particle, this type of search can be conducted by detecting $\gamma$-rays in astrophysical objects with high concentrations of dark matter. Dwarf galaxies, although not the most dense, are excellent targets for this type of observation since they are dominated by dark matter, are relatively close to Earth, and have a low astrophysical background. In this work, the detectability of dark matter annihilation or decay signals from dwarf galaxies is predicted using the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO), a future $\gamma$-ray observatory that will be built in South America. This wide field-of-view survey instrument will be able to study many important dark matter targets in the Southern Hemisphere, and the combined observation of all targets will provide competitive, if not the best, limits for dark matter with masses in the range of hundreds of GeV to PeV.

2023-09-18, **JWST lensed quasar dark matter survey I: Description and First Results**, A. M. Nierenberg et.al., [2309.10101v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10101v1)

 The flux ratios of gravitationally lensed quasars provide a powerful probe of the nature of dark matter. Importantly, these ratios are sensitive to small-scale structure, irrespective of the presence of baryons. This sensitivity may allow us to study the halo mass function even below the scales where galaxies form observable stars. For accurate measurements, it is essential that the quasar's light is emitted from a physical region of the quasar with an angular scale of milli-arcseconds or larger; this minimizes microlensing effects by stars within the deflector. The warm dust region of quasars fits this criterion, as it has parsec-size physical scales and dominates the spectral energy distribution of quasars at wavelengths greater than 10$\mu$m. The JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) is adept at detecting redshifted light in this wavelength range, offering both the spatial resolution and sensitivity required for accurate gravitational lensing flux ratio measurements. Here, we introduce our survey designed to measure the warm dust flux ratios of 31 lensed quasars. We discuss the flux-ratio measurement technique and present results for the first target, DES J0405-3308. We find that we can measure the quasar warm dust flux ratios with 3% precision. Our simulations suggest that this precision makes it feasible to detect the presence of 10$^7$ M$\_\odot$ dark matter halos at cosmological distances. Such halos are expected to be completely dark in Cold Dark Matter models.

2023-09-18, **X-rays constraints on sub-GeV Dark Matter**, Jordan Koechler et.al., [2309.10043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10043v1)

 We present updated constraints on 'light' Dark Matter (DM) particles with masses between 1 MeV and 5 GeV. In this range, we can expect DM-produced $e^\pm$ pairs to up-scatter low-energy ambient photons in the Milky Way via the Inverse Compton process, and produce a flux of X-rays that can be probed by a range of space observatories. Using diffuse X-ray data from XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, NuSTAR and Suzaku, we compute the strongest constraints to date on annihilating DM for 200 MeV $< m\_{\rm DM} <$ 5 GeV and decaying DM for 100 MeV $< m\_{\rm DM} <$ 5 GeV.

2023-09-18, **Gravitational Wave Resonance in Ultra-Light Dark Matter Halos**, Paola C. M. Delgado et.al., [2309.09946v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09946v1)

 Ultra-Light Dark Matter (ULDM) halos constituted by Ultra-Light Axions (ULAs) generate gravitational potentials that oscillate in time. In this paper I show these potentials interact with gravitational waves, resonantly amplifying them. For all ULA masses considered, the resonance in the solar region is currently negligible, while in a denser dark matter environment, which may arise due to different phenomena, it might become significant. The frequency of the amplified gravitational wave is equal to the ULA mass in the case of first resonance band, which represents the most efficient scenario.

2023-09-18, **CMB constraints on inflection-point inflation with a pseudo-scalar dark matter**, Jamerson G. Rodrigues et.al., [2309.09842v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09842v1)

 In this work, we investigate the physical aspects of the inflection-point inflation scenario and assess its observational viability in light of current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. The model we consider encapsulates the inflaton with a pseudo-scalar (the dark matter candidate) in a complex neutral scalar singlet. The cosmological constraints on the parameters of inflation derived at a high energy scale are translated to a low energy scale by running these parameters. Ensuring the entire Lagrangian to be invariant under a $Z\_3$ symmetry with the adequate transformation of the fields, the imaginary part of the singlet decouples from the other scalars of the model. We then investigate if the observational viability of inflation is also compatible with this pseudo-scalar being the dark matter component. We show that the CMB constraints on the inflationary parameters assure that the pseudo-scalar is stable and provides the correct relic dark matter abundance, regardless of whether it is thermally or non-thermally produced.

2023-09-18, **Probing Light DM through Migdal Effect with Spherical Proportional Counter**, Yuchao Gu et.al., [2309.09740v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09740v1)

 Owing to its low electronic noise and flexible target materials, the Spherical Proportional Counter (SPC) with a single electron detection threshold can be utilized to search for sub-GeV dark matter (DM). In this work, we investigate the prospects for light DM direct detection through the DM-nucleus Migdal effect in the DARKSPHERE detector. We consider the different DM velocity distributions and momentum-transfer effects. For Xenon and Neon targets, we find that the DM mass $m\_{DM}$ can be probed down to as low as $m\_{DM} \sim \mathcal{O}$(10) MeV, and the derived bounds on the DM-nucleus scattering cross section $\bar{\sigma}\_{n}$ are sensitive to the high-velocity tails of the DM velocity distribution, which can be altered by orders of magnitude for the different DM velocity distributions in the region $m\_{DM} < 10$ MeV.

2023-09-18, **TeV gamma-ray sensitivity to velocity-dependent dark matter models in the Galactic Center**, Alessandro Montanari et.al., [2309.09691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09691v1)

 The center of the Milky Way is a prime site to search for signals of dark matter (DM) annihilation due to its proximity and expected high concentration of DM. The amplification of the dispersion velocity of DM particles in the Galactic center (GC), caused by baryonic contraction and feedback, makes this particular region of the sky an even more promising target for exploring velocity-dependent DM models. Here we demonstrate that current GC observations with the H.E.S.S. telescope, presently the most sensitive TeV-scale gamma-ray telescope in operation in this region of the sky, set the strongest constraints on velocity-dependent annihilating DM particles with masses above 200 GeV. For p-wave annihilations, they improve the current constraints by a factor of $\sim$4 for a DM mass of 1 TeV. For the spatial distribution of DM, we use the results of the latest FIRE-2 zoom cosmological simulation of Milky Way-size halos. In addition, we utilize the newest version of the GALPROP cosmic-ray propagation framework to simulate the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission in the GC. We have found that p-wave (d-wave) DM particles with a mass of approximately 1.7 TeV and annihilating into the $W^+$$W^-$ channel exhibit a velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section upper limit of 4.6$\times$ 10$^{-22}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$ (9.2$\times$10$^{-17}$ cm$^3$s$^{- 1}$) at a 95\% confidence level. This is about 460 (2$\times$ 10$^{6}$) times greater than the thermal relic cross-section for p-wave (d-wave) DM models.

 Dark matter (DM) is one of the major components in the Universe. However, at present its existence is still only inferred through indirect astronomical observations. DM particles can annihilate or decay, producing final-state Standard Model pairs that subsequently annihilate into high-energy $\gamma$-rays. The dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the Milky Way DM halo have long been considered optimal targets to search for annihilating DM signatures in GeV-to-TeV $\gamma$-ray spectra due to their high DM densities (hence high astrophysical factors), as well as the expected absence of intrinsic $\gamma$-ray emission of astrophysical origin. For such targets, it is important to compute the amount of DM in their halos in a consistent way to optimize the $\gamma$-ray data analysis. Such estimates directly affect the observability of DM signals in dSphs, as well as the DM constraints that can be derived in case of null detection. In this contribution, we present the results on the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) for DM annihilation and decay searches using planned observations of the Milky Way dSphs. We select the most promising targets among all presently known dwarf satellites, providing new determinations of their expected DM signal. This study shows an improvement of approximately an order of magnitude in sensitivity compared to current searches in similar targets. We also discuss the results in terms of cuspy and cored DM models, and investigate the sensitivity obtained by the combination of observations from different dSphs. Finally, we explore the optimal strategies for CTA observations of dSphs.

2023-09-18, **Clock Transitions Versus Bragg Diffraction in Atom-interferometric Dark-matter Detection**, Daniel Derr et.al., [2309.09538v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09538v1)

 Atom interferometers with long baselines are envisioned to complement the ongoing search for dark matter. They rely on atomic manipulation based on internal (clock) transitions or state-preserving atomic diffraction. Principally, dark matter can act on the internal as well as the external degrees of freedom to both of which atom interferometers are susceptible. We therefore study in this contribution the effects of dark matter on the internal atomic structure and the atoms' motion. In particular, we show that the atomic transition frequency depends on the mean coupling and the differential coupling of the involved states to dark matter, scaling with the unperturbed atomic transition frequency and the Compton frequency, respectively. The differential coupling is only of relevance when internal states change, which makes detectors, e.g., based on single-photon transitions sensitive to both coupling parameters. For sensors generated by state-preserving diffraction mechanisms like Bragg diffraction, the mean coupling modifies only the motion of the atom as the dominant contribution. Finally, we compare both effects observed in terrestrial dark-matter detectors.

 We consider a particular k-essence scalar field model for the late-time cosmic acceleration in which the sound speed, parametrized as $c\_s$ is constant. We compute the relevant background and perturbation quantities corresponding to the observables like cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the $f\sigma\_8$. We put constraints on the $c\_s^2$ parameter from these observations along with other parameters. We find lower values of $c\_s^2$ which are close to zero are tightly constrained. Particularly, we find mean value of $\log\_{\rm 10} (c\_s^2)$ to be $-0.61$ and $c\_s^2 \leq 10^{-3}$ is more than 3$\sigma$ away from this mean value. This means these observations favor a homogeneous dark energy component compared to the clustering one.

2023-09-18, **How Tycho Brahe's recordings in 1572 support SN 1572 as a type I(a) supernova**, Tobias Cornelius Hinse et.al., [2309.10120v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10120v1)

 The 450th anniversary of the discovery of the SN 1572 supernova event was celebrated in 2022. A closer look at the historical development of the field of supernova astronomy reveals the scientific importance of Tycho Brahe's 1572 observations of this "new star". In their quest to learn more about the new type of stellar explosion and subsequent evolution, the initial protagonists in this field (Baader and Zwicky among others) gradually turned their attention to the final remnant state of these supernova events. Since the remnant object thought to be associated with the extragalactic supernova event was found to be very dim, the focus quickly shifted toward nearby galactic events. It is at this point where Tycho Brahe's observations played an important and often overlooked role in the context of the development of stellar evolution as a scientific field. Tycho Brahe's meticulous and detailed recordings of the change in brightness of the new star not only allowed modern astronomers to classify SN 1572 as a supernova event but also helped them pinpoint the exact astrometric location of SN 1572. These findings helped to empirically link extragalactic supernova events to nearby past supernova remnants in the Milky Way. This enabled subsequent observations allowing further characterization. Transforming the historical recordings to a standardized photometric system also allowed the classification of SN 1572 as a type I supernova event.

2023-09-18, **Strong Carbon Features and a Red Early Color in the Underluminous Type Ia SN 2022xkq**, Jeniveve Pearson et.al., [2309.10054v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10054v1)

 We present optical, infrared, ultraviolet, and radio observations of SN 2022xkq, an underluminous fast-declining type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 1784 ($\mathrm{D}\approx31$ Mpc), from $<1$ to 180 days after explosion. The high-cadence observations of SN 2022xkq, a photometrically transitional and spectroscopically 91bg-like SN Ia, cover the first days and weeks following explosion which are critical to distinguishing between explosion scenarios. The early light curve of SN 2022xkq has a red early color and exhibits a flux excess which is more prominent in redder bands; this is the first time such a feature has been seen in a transitional/91bg-like SN Ia. We also present 92 optical and 19 near-infrared (NIR) spectra, beginning 0.4 days after explosion in the optical and 2.6 days after explosion in the NIR. SN 2022xkq exhibits a long-lived C I 1.0693 $\mu$m feature which persists until 5 days post-maximum. We also detect C II $\lambda$6580 in the pre-maximum optical spectra. These lines are evidence for unburnt carbon that is difficult to reconcile with the double detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. No existing explosion model can fully explain the photometric and spectroscopic dataset of SN 2022xkq, but the considerable breadth of the observations is ideal for furthering our understanding of the processes which produce faint SNe Ia.

2023-09-18, **The Progenitor Star of SN 2023ixf: A Massive Red Supergiant with Enhanced, Episodic Pre-Supernova Mass Loss**, Yu-Jing Qin et.al., [2309.10022v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10022v1)

 We identify the progenitor star of SN 2023ixf in the nearby galaxy Messier 101 using Keck/NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging and pre-explosion HST/ACS images. The supernova position, localized with diffraction-spike pattern and high precision relative astrometry, unambiguously coincides with a single progenitor candidate of m\_F814W=24.96(-0.04)(+0.05). Forced photometry further recovers 2-sigma detections in the F673N and F675W bands and imposes robust flux limits on the bluer bands. Given the reported infrared excess and semi-regular variability of the progenitor, we fit a time-dependent spectral energy distribution (SED) model of a dusty red supergiant (RSG) to a combined dataset of HST photometry, as well as ground-based near-infrared and Spitzer/IRAC [3.6], [4.5] photometry from the literature. The progenitor closely resembles a RSG of T\_eff=3343+/-27 K and logL=5.10+/-0.02, with a 0.11+/-0.01 dex (25.2+/-1.7 per cent) variation over the mean luminosity at a period of P=1128.3+/-6.5 days, heavily obscured by a dust envelope with an optical depth of tau=2.83+/-0.03 at 1 micron (or A\_V=10.28+/-0.11 mag). Such observed signatures match a post-main sequence star of 18.1(-1.2)(+0.7) Msun, close to the most massive SN II progenitor, with a pulsation-enhanced mass-loss rate of M\_dot=(3.58+/-0.15) x 10^(-4) Msun/yr. The dense and confined circumstellar material is likely ejected during the last episode of radial pulsation before the explosion. Notably, we find strong evidence for periodic variation of tau (or both T\_eff and tau) along with luminosity, a necessary assumption to reproduce the wavelength dependence of the variability, which implies dust sublimation and condensation during radial pulsations. Given the observed SED, partial dust obscuration remains a possible scenario, but any unobstructed binary companion over 7.1 Msun can be ruled out.

2023-09-18, **SN 2022crv: IIb, Or Not IIb: That is the Question**, Yize Dong et.al., [2309.09433v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09433v1)

 We present optical and near-infrared observations of SN~2022crv, a stripped envelope supernova in NGC~3054, discovered within 12 hrs of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc Survey. We suggest SN~2022crv is a transitional object on the continuum between SNe Ib and SNe IIb. A high-velocity hydrogen feature ($\sim$$-$20,000 -- $-$16,000 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$) was conspicuous in SN~2022crv at early phases, and then quickly disappeared around maximum light. By comparing with hydrodynamic modeling, we find that a hydrogen envelope of $\sim 10^{-3}$ \msun{} can reproduce the behaviour of the hydrogen feature observed in SN~2022crv. The early light curve of SN~2022crv did not show envelope cooling emission, implying that SN~2022crv had a compact progenitor with extremely low amount of hydrogen. The analysis of the nebular spectra shows that SN~2022crv is consistent with the explosion of a He star with a final mass of $\sim$4.5 -- 5.6 \msun{} that has evolved from a $\sim$16 -- 22 \msun{} zero-age main sequence star in a binary system with about 1.0 -- 1.7 \msun{} of oxygen finally synthesized in the core. The high metallicity at the supernova site indicates that the progenitor experienced a strong stellar wind mass loss. In order to retain a small amount of residual hydrogen at such a high metallicity, the initial orbital separation of the binary system is likely larger than $\sim$1000~$\rm R\_{\odot}$. The near-infrared spectra of SN~2022crv show a unique absorption feature on the blue side of He I line at $\sim$1.005~$\mu$m. This is the first time that such a feature has been observed in a Type Ib/IIb, and could be due to \ion{Sr}{2}. Further detailed modelling on SN~2022crv can shed light on the progenitor and the origin of the mysterious absorption feature in the near infrared.
