2023-11-02, **Search for Periodic Time Variations of the Solar $^8$B Neutrino Flux Between 1996 and 2018 in Super-Kamiokande**, K. Abe et.al., [2311.01159v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01159v1)

 We report a search for time variations of the solar $^8$B neutrino flux using 5,804 live days of Super-Kamiokande data collected between May 31, 1996, and May 30, 2018. Super-Kamiokande measured the precise time of each solar neutrino interaction over 22 calendar years to search for solar neutrino flux modulations with unprecedented precision. Periodic modulations are searched for in a data set comprised of five-day interval solar neutrino flux measurements with a maximum likelihood method. We also applied the Lomb-Scargle method to this data set to compare it with previous reports. The only significant modulation found is due to the elliptic orbit of the Earth around the Sun. The observed modulation is consistent with astronomical data: we measured an eccentricity of (1.53$\pm$0.35)\,\%, and a perihelion shift is ($-$1.5$\pm$13.5)\,days.

 Wash-in leptogenesis is a powerful mechanism to generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe that treats right-handed-neutrino interactions on the same footing as electroweak sphaleron processes: as mere spectator processes acting on the background of chemical potentials in the Standard Model plasma. Successful wash-in leptogenesis requires this chemical background to be CP-violating, which can be achieved by violating any of the more than ten global charges that are conserved in the Standard Model at very high temperatures. In this paper, we demonstrate that the primordial charge asymmetries required for wash-in leptogenesis can be readily produced by evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs). Our argument is based on the fact that the Hawking radiation emitted by PBHs contains more or less any state in the particle spectrum. Therefore, if heavy states with CP-violating decays are present in the ultraviolet, PBH evaporation will unavoidably lead to the production of these states. We illustrate this scenario by means of a simple toy model where PBH evaporation leads to the production of heavy particles that we call asymmetrons and whose decay results in a primordial charge asymmetry for right-handed electrons, which in turn sets the initial conditions for wash-in leptogenesis. We focus on the parameter region where the decay of the initial thermal asymmetron abundance occurs long before PBH evaporation and only results in a negligible primordial charge asymmetry. PBH evaporation at later times then serves as a mechanism to resurrect the asymmetron abundance and ensure the successful generation of the baryon asymmetry after all. We conclude that PBHs can act as asymmetry-producing machines that grant access to whatever CP-violating physics may be present in the ultraviolet, rekindling it at lower energies where it can be reprocessed into a baryon asymmetry by right-handed neutrinos.

 The RED-100 experiment with a liquid xenon target was carried out at Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant. The goal of the experiment is the detection and study of the coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering process (CE$\nu$NS) for the low-energy antineutrinos in close vicinity to a reactor core. A good understanding of the external radioactive background is needed to achieve this goal. This paper describes the external background conditions for the RED-100 experiment at Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant.

2023-11-01, **Dark Matter in A Mirror Solution to the Strong CP Problem**, Quentin Bonnefoy et.al., [2311.00702v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00702v1)

 We study thermal production of dark matter (DM) in a realization of the minimal models of Ref.\cite{Bonnefoy:2023afx}, where parity is used to solve the strong CP problem by transforming the entire Standard Model (SM) into a mirror copy. Although the mirror electron $e^{\prime}$ is a good DM candidate, its viability is mired by the presence of the mirror up-quark $u^{\prime}$, whose abundance is intimately related to the $e^{\prime}$ abundance and must be suppressed. This can be achieved through a sequential freeze-in mechanism, where mirror photons are first produced from SM gluons, and then the mirror photons produce $e'$. After computing the details of this double freeze-in, we discuss the allowed parameter space of the model, which lies at the threshold of experimental observations. We find that this origin of $e'$ DM requires a low reheating temperature after inflation and is consistent with the baryon asymmetry arising from leptogenesis, providing mirror neutrinos have a significant degeneracy. Finally, we show that this $e'$ DM is not compatible with Higgs Parity, the simplest scheme with exact parity, unless SM parameters deviate significantly from their central values or the minimal model is extended.

 Although the LHC experiments have searched for and excluded many proposed new particles up to masses close to 1 TeV, there are many scenarios that are difficult to address at a hadron collider. This talk will review a number of these scenarios and present the expectations for searches at an electron-positron collider such as the International Linear Collider. The cases discussed include SUSY in strongly or moderately compressed models, heavy neutrinos, heavy vector bosons coupling to the s-channel in $e^+e^-$ annihilation, and new scalars.

2023-11-01, **The origin of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos: new results and prospects**, Sergey Troitsky et.al., [2311.00281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00281v1)

 High-energy neutrino astrophysics is rapidly developing, and in the last two years, new and exciting results have been obtained. Among them are the confirmation of the existence of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux by the new independent Baikal-GVD experiment, the discovery of the neutrino emission of our Galaxy, new confirmations of the origin of a part of astrophysical neutrinos in blazars, and much more. This brief review, based on the author's presentation at the session of the RAS Physical Science Division "Gamma quanta and neutrinos from space: what we can see now and what we need to see more", summarizes the results obtained since the publication of the review arXiv:2112.09611, and can be considered as a companion to it.

2023-11-02, **Search for an invisible muon philic scalar $X_{0}$ or vector $X_{1}$ via $J/ψ\toμ^+μ^-+\rm{invisible}$ decay at BESIII**, BESIII Collaboration et.al., [2311.01076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01076v1)

 A light scalar $X\_{0}$ or vector $X\_{1}$ particles have been introduced as a possible explanation for the $(g-2)\_{\mu}$ anomaly and dark matter phenomena.   Using $(8.998\pm 0.039)\times10^9$ $\jpsi $ events collected by the BESIII detector, we search for a light muon philic scalar $X\_{0}$ or vector $X\_{1}$ in the processes $J/\psi\to\mu^+\mu^- X\_{0,1}$ with $X\_{0,1}$ invisible decays. No obvious signal is found, and the upper limits on the coupling $g\_{0,1}'$ between the muon and the $X\_{0,1}$ particles are set to be between $1.1\times10^{-3}$ and $1.0\times10^{-2}$ for the $X\_{0,1}$ mass in the range of $1<M(X\_{0,1})<1000$~MeV$/c^2$ at 90$\%$ confidence level.

2023-11-01, **Scattering Amplitudes of Massive Spin-2 Kaluza-Klein States with Matter**, R. Sekhar Chivukula et.al., [2311.00770v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00770v1)

 We perform a comprehensive analysis of the scattering of matter and gravitational Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes in five-dimensional gravity theories. We consider matter localized on a brane as well as in the bulk of the extra dimension for scalars, fermions and vectors respectively, and consider an arbitrary warped background. While naive power-counting suggests that there are amplitudes which grow as fast as ${\cal O}(s^3)$ [where $s$ is the center-of-mass scattering energy-squared], we demonstrate that cancellations between the various contributions result in a total amplitude which grows no faster than ${\cal O}(s)$. Extending previous work on the self-interactions of the gravitational KK modes, we show that these cancellations occur due to sum-rule relations between the couplings and the masses of the modes that can be proven from the properties of the mode equations describing the gravity and matter wavefunctions. We demonstrate that these properties are tied to the underlying diffeomorphism invariance of the five-dimensional theory. We discuss how our results generalize when the size of the extra dimension is stabilized via the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. Our conclusions are of particular relevance for freeze-out and freeze-in relic abundance calculations for dark matter models including a spin-2 portal arising from an underlying five-dimensional theory.

2023-11-01, **Distinct distributions of elliptical and disk galaxies across the Local Supercluster as a $Λ$CDM prediction**, Till Sawala et.al., [2311.00755v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00755v1)

 Galaxies of different types are not equally distributed in the Local Universe. In particular, the supergalactic plane is prominent among the brightest ellipticals, but inconspicuous among the brightest disk galaxies. This striking difference provides a unique test for our understanding of galaxy and structure formation. Here we use the SIBELIUS DARK constrained simulation to confront the predictions of the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and standard galaxy formation theory with these observations. We find that SIBELIUS DARK reproduces the spatial distributions of disks and ellipticals and, in particular, the observed excess of massive ellipticals near the supergalactic equator. We show that this follows directly from the local large-scale structure and from the standard galaxy formation paradigm, wherein disk galaxies evolve mostly in isolation, while giant ellipticals congregate in the massive clusters that define the supergalactic plane. Rather than being anomalous as earlier works have suggested, the distributions of giant ellipticals and disks in the Local Universe and in relation to the supergalactic plane are key predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model.

2023-11-01, **Rogue worlds meet the dark side: revealing terrestrial-mass primordial black holes with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope**, William DeRocco et.al., [2311.00751v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00751v1)

 Gravitational microlensing is one of the strongest observational techniques to observe non-luminous astrophysical bodies. Existing microlensing observations provide tantalizing evidence of a population of low-mass objects whose origin is unknown. These events may be caused by terrestrial-mass free-floating planets or by exotic objects such as primordial black holes. However, the nature of these objects cannot be resolved on an event-by-event basis, as the induced light curve is degenerate for lensing bodies of identical mass. One must instead statistically compare \textit{distributions} of lensing events to determine the nature of the lensing population. While existing surveys lack the statistics required to identify multiple subpopulations of lenses, this will change with the launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Roman's Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey is expected to observe hundreds of low-mass microlensing events, enabling a robust statistical characterization of this population. In this paper, we show that by exploiting features in the distribution of lensing event durations, Roman will be sensitive to a subpopulation of primordial black holes hidden amongst a background of free-floating planets. Roman's reach will extend to primordial black hole dark matter fractions as low as $f\_\text{PBH} = 10^{-4}$ at peak sensitivity, and will be able to conclusively determine the origin of existing ultrashort-timescale microlensing events. A positive detection would provide evidence that a significant fraction of the cosmological dark matter consists of macroscopic, non-luminous objects.

2023-11-01, **Constraining Dark Matter-Proton Scattering from Molecular Cloud Ionization**, Carlos Blanco et.al., [2311.00740v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00740v1)

 Optically dense clouds in the interstellar medium composed predominantly of molecular hydrogen, known as molecular clouds, are sensitive to energy injection in the form of photon absorption, cosmic-ray scattering, and dark matter (DM) scattering. The ionization rates in dense molecular clouds are heavily constrained by observations of abundances of various molecular tracers. Recent studies have set constraints on the DM-electron scattering cross section using measurements of ionization rates in dense molecular clouds. Here we calculate the analogous bounds on the DM-proton cross section using the molecular Migdal effect, recently adapted from the neutron scattering literature to the DM context. These bounds may be the strongest limits on a strongly-coupled DM subfraction, and represent the first application of the Migdal effect to astrophysical systems.

2023-11-01, **Viscous Ricci Dark Energy Cosmological Models in Brans-Dicke Theory**, M. Vijayasanthi et.al., [2311.00736v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00736v1)

 The whole article deals with the analysis of the cosmic model of Ruban's space-time in the context of a bulk viscosity impact in the form of Ricci dark energy within the framework Brans-Dicke theory (Brans and Dicke, Phys. Rev. 124, 925 (1961)). We believe that outer space is filled with dark matter and viscous Ricci dark energy (VRDE) under the pressureless situation. The velocity and rate at which the Universe is expanding are presumed to be proportional to the coefficient of total bulk viscosity, is in the form, -- , are the constants. To solve the RDE model's field equations, we utilize the relation among the metric potentials and also the power-law relation among the average scale factor a(t) and scalar field . To examine the evolutionary dynamics of the Universe, we investigate the deceleration parameter(q), jerk parameter(j), EoS parameter , Om(z), stability of the obtained models through the square speed of the sound, wde wde' plane, statefinder parameter planes (r, s) and (q, r) and presented via graphical representation. By the end of the discussion, VRDE model was found to be compatible with the present accelerated expansion of the Universe.

2023-11-01, **DEIMOS spectroscopy of $z=6$ protocluster candidate in COSMOS -- A massive protocluster embedded in a large scale structure?**, Malte Brinch et.al., [2311.00511v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00511v2)

 We present the results of our Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic follow-up of candidate galaxies of i-band-dropout protocluster candidate galaxies at $z\sim6$ in the COSMOS field. We securely detect Lyman-$\alpha$ emission lines in 14 of the 30 objects targeted, 10 of them being at $z=6$ with a signal-to-noise ratio of $5-20$, the remaining galaxies are either non-detections or interlopers with redshift too different from $z=6$ to be part of the protocluster. The 10 galaxies at $z\approx6$ make the protocluster one of the riches at $z>5$. The emission lines exhibit asymmetric profiles with high skewness values ranging from 2.87 to 31.75, with a median of 7.37. This asymmetry is consistent with them being Ly$\alpha$, resulting in a redshift range of $z=5.85-6.08$. Using the spectroscopic redshifts, we re-calculate the overdensity map for the COSMOS field and find the galaxies to be in a significant overdensity at the $4\sigma$ level, with a peak overdensity of $\delta=11.8$ (compared to the previous value of $\delta=9.2$). The protocluster galaxies have stellar masses derived from Bagpipes SED fits of $10^{8.29}-10^{10.28} \rm \,M\_{\rm \odot}$ and star formation rates of $2-39\,\rm M\_{\rm \odot}\rm\,yr^{-1}$, placing them on the main sequence at this epoch. Using a stellar-to-halo-mass relationship, we estimate the dark matter halo mass of the most massive halo in the protocluster to be $\sim 10^{12}\rm M\_{\rm \odot}$. By comparison with halo mass evolution tracks from simulations, the protocluster is expected to evolve into a Virgo- or Coma-like cluster in the present day.

2023-11-01, **Constraining the General Oscillatory Inflaton Potential with Freeze-in Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves**, Jose A. R. Cembranos et.al., [2311.00378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00378v1)

 The reheating phase after inflation is one of the least observationally constrained epochs in the evolution of the Universe. The forthcoming gravitational wave observatories will enable us to constrain at least some of the non-standard scenarios. For example, if the radiation bath is produced via the perturbative inflaton decay that oscillates around a flat minimum of the potential of the form $V\propto\phi^{2n}$, with $n>2$. In such scenarios a part of the inflationary gravitational wave spectrum becomes blue tilted, making it observable, depending on the inflation energy scale and the reheating temperature. The degeneracy between the latter two parameters can be broken if dark matter in the Universe is produced by the freeze-in mechanism. The combination of the independent measurement of dark matter mass with gravitational wave observations makes it possible to constrain the reheating temperature and the energy density at the end of inflation.

2023-11-01, **Gravitational Waves from Preheating in Inflation with Weyl Symmetry**, Wei-Yu Hu et.al., [2311.00239v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00239v1)

 Inflation with Weyl scaling symmetry provides a viable scenario that can generate both the nearly scaling invariant primordial density fluctuation and a dark matter candidate. Here we point out that, in additional to the primordial gravitational waves (GWs) from quantum fluctuations, the production of high-frequency GWs from preheating in such inflation models can provide an another probe of the inflationary dynamics. We conduct both linear analytical analysis and nonlinear numerical lattice simulation in a typical model. We find that significant stochastic GWs can be produced and the frequency band is located around $10^8$ Hz $\sim$ $10^9$ Hz, which might be probed by future resonance-cavity experiments.

2023-11-01, **Pulsar Timing Array Signature from Oscillating Metric Perturbations due to Ultra-light Axion**, Jai-chan Hwang et.al., [2311.00234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00234v1)

 A coherently oscillating ultra-light axion can behave as dark matter. In particular, its coherently oscillating pressure perturbations can source an oscillating scalar metric perturbation, with a characteristic oscillation frequency which is twice the axion Compton frequency. A candidate in the mass range $10^{(-24,-21)}{\rm eV}$ can provide a signal in the frequency range tested by current and future Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) programs. Involving the pressure perturbations in a highly nonlinear environment, such an analysis demands a relativistic and nonlinear treatment. Here, we provide a rigorous derivation of the effect assuming weak gravity and slow-motion limit of Einstein's gravity in zero-shear gauge and show that dark matter's velocity potential determines the oscillation phase and frequency change. A monochromatic PTA signal correlated with the velocity field would confirm the prediction, for example, by cross-correlating the PTA results with the future local velocity flow measurements.

2023-11-02, **Cosmological foundations revisited with Pantheon+**, Zachary G. Lane et.al., [2311.01438v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01438v1)

 We reanalyse the Pantheon+ supernova catalogue to compare a cosmology with non-FLRW evolution, the "timescape cosmology", with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. To this end, we consider the Pantheon+ supernova catalogue, which is the largest available Type Ia supernova dataset for a geometric comparison between the two models. We construct a covariance matrix to be as independent of cosmology as possible, including independence from the FLRW geometry and peculiar velocity with respect to FLRW average evolution. Within this framework, which goes far beyond most other definitions of "model independence", we introduce new statistics to refine Type Ia supernova (SneIa) light-curve analysis. In addition to conventional galaxy correlation functions used to define the scale of statistical homogeneity we introduce empirical statistics which enables a refined analysis of the distribution biases of SneIa light-curve parameters $\beta c$ and $\alpha x\_1$.   For lower redshifts, the Bayesian analysis highlights important features attributable to the increased number of low-redshift supernovae, the artefacts of model-dependent light-curve fitting and the cosmic structure through which we observe supernovae. This indicates the need for cosmology-independent data reduction to conduct a stronger investigation of the emergence of statistical homogeneity and to compare alternative cosmologies in light of recent challenges to the standard model.   "Dark energy" is generally invoked as a place-holder for "new physics". Our from-first-principles reanalysis of the Pantheon+ catalogue supports future deeper studies of the interplay of matter and nonlinear spacetime geometry, in a data-driven setting. For the first time in 25 years, we find evidence that the Pantheon+ catalogue already contains such a wealth of data that with further reanalysis, a genuine "paradigm shift" may soon emerge.

 AM CVn-type systems are ultracompact, helium-accreting binary systems which are evolutionarily linked to the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae and are expected to be strong Galactic sources of gravitational waves detectable to upcoming space-based interferometers. AM CVn binaries with orbital periods $\lesssim$ 20--23 min exist in a constant high state with a permanently ionised accretion disc. We present the discovery of TIC 378898110, a bright ($G=14.3$ mag), nearby ($309.3 \pm 1.8$ pc), high-state AM CVn binary discovered in TESS two-minute-cadence photometry. At optical wavelengths this is the third-brightest AM CVn binary known. The photometry of the system shows a 23.07172(6) min periodicity, which is likely to be the `superhump' period and implies an orbital period in the range 22--23 min. There is no detectable spectroscopic variability. The system underwent an unusual, year-long brightening event during which the dominant photometric period changed to a shorter period (constrained to $20.5 \pm 2.0$ min), which we suggest may be evidence for the onset of disc-edge eclipses. The estimated mass transfer rate, $\log (\dot{M} / \mathrm{M\_\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}) = -6.8 \pm 1.0$, is unusually high and may suggest a high-mass or thermally inflated donor. The binary is detected as an X-ray source, with a flux of $9.2 ^{+4.2}\_{-1.8} \times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 0.3--10 keV range. TIC 378898110 is the shortest-period binary system discovered with TESS, and its large predicted gravitational-wave amplitude makes it a compelling verification binary for future space-based gravitational wave detectors.

2023-11-02, **The TYPHOON stellar population synthesis survey: I. The young stellar population of the Great Barred Spiral NGC 1365**, Eva Sextl et.al., [2311.01140v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01140v1)

 We analyze TYPHOON long slit absorption line spectra of the starburst barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 obtained with the Progressive Integral Step Method covering an area of 15 square kpc. Applying a population synthesis technique, we determine the spatial distribution of ages and metallicity of the young and old stellar population together with star formation rates, reddening, extinction and the ratio R$\_V$ of extinction to reddening. We detect a clear indication of inside-out growth of the stellar disk beyond 3 kpc characterized by an outward increasing luminosity fraction of the young stellar population, a decreasing average age and a history of mass growth, which was finished 2 Gyrs later in the outermost disk. The metallicity of the young stellar population is clearly super solar but decreases towards larger galactocentric radii with a gradient of -0.02 dex/kpc. On the other hand, the metal content of the old population does not show a gradient and stays constant at a level roughly 0.4 dex lower than that of the young population. In the center of NGC 1365 we find a confined region where the metallicity of the young population drops dramatically and becomes lower than that of the old population. We attribute this to infall of metal poor gas and, additionally, to interrupted chemical evolution where star formation is stopped by AGN and supernova feedback and then after several Gyrs resumes with gas ejected by stellar winds from earlier generations of stars. We provide a simple model calculation as support for the latter.

2023-11-01, **A bias-corrected luminosity function for red supergiant supernova progenitor stars**, Nora L. Strotjohann et.al., [2311.00744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00744v1)

 The apparent tension between the luminosity functions of red supergiant (RSG) stars and of RSG progenitors of Type II supernovae (SNe) is often referred to as the RSG problem and it motivated some to suggest that many RSGs end their life without a SN explosion. However, the luminosity functions of RSG SN progenitors presented so far were biased to high luminosities, because the sensitivity of the search was not considered. Here, we use limiting magnitudes to calculate a bias-corrected RSG progenitor luminosity function. We find that only $(36\pm11)\%$ of all RSG progenitors are brighter than a bolometric magnitude of $-7\,\text{mag}$, a significantly smaller fraction than $(56\pm5)\%$ quoted by Davies & Beasor (2020). The larger uncertainty is due to the relatively small progenitor sample, while uncertainties on measured quantities such as magnitudes, bolometric corrections, extinction, or SN distances, only have a minor impact, as long as they fluctuate randomly for different objects in the sample. When comparing the luminosity function of RSG SN progenitors to Type M supergiants in the Large Magellanic cloud, we find that they are consistent, due to the flatter shape of the progenitor luminosity function. The RSG progenitor luminosity function, hence, does not imply the existence of failed SNe.   The presented statistical method is not limited to progenitor searches, but applies to any situation in which a measurement is done for a sample of detected objects, but the probed quantity or property can only be determined for part of the sample.

2023-11-01, **Optical Properties and Variability of the Be X-ray binary CPD -29 2176**, Clarissa M. Pavao et.al., [2311.00293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00293v1)

 Be X-ray binaries (Be XRBs) are high-mass X-ray binaries, with a neutron star or black hole orbiting and accreting material from a non-supergiant B-star that is rotating at a near critical rate. These objects are prime targets to understand past binary interactions as the neutron star or black hole progenitor likely experienced Roche lobe overflow to spin up the Be star we observe now. The stellar variability can then allow us to explore the stellar structure of these objects. It was recently demonstrated that the high-mass X-ray binary CPD -29 2176 descended from an ultra-stripped supernova and is a prime target to evolve into an eventual binary neutron star and kilonova. We present the photometric variability from both TESS and ASAS along with the spectral properties and disk variability of the system in this paper. All of the optical lines are contaminated with disk emission except for the He II $\lambda$4686 absorption line. The disk variability time-scales are not the same as the orbital time scale, but could be related to the X-ray outbursts that have been recorded by Swift. We end our study with a discussion comparing CPD -29 2176 to classical Be stars and other Be X-ray binaries, finding the stellar rotation to be near a frequency of 1.5 cycles d$^{-1}$, and exhibiting incoherent variability in three frequency groups.

2023-11-01, **An effective description of Laniakea and its backreaction: Impact on Cosmology and the local determination of the Hubble constant**, L. Giani et.al., [2311.00215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00215v1)

 We propose an effective model to describe the backreaction on cosmological observables induced by Laniakea, the gravitational supercluster hosting the Milky Way, which was defined using peculiar velocity data from Cosmicflows-4 (CF4). The structure is well described by an ellipsoidal shape exhibiting triaxial expansion, reasonably approximated by a constant expansion rate along the principal axes. Our best fits suggest that the ellipsoid, after subtracting the background expansion, contracts along the two smaller axes and expands along the longest one, predicting an average expansion of $\sim -1.1 ~\rm{km}/\rm{s}/\rm{Mpc}$. The different expansion rates within the region, relative to the mean cosmological expansion, induce line-of-sight-dependent corrections in the computation of luminosity distances. We apply these corrections to two low-redshift datasets: the Pantheon+ catalog of type Ia Supernovae (SN~Ia), and 63 measurements of Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF) of early-type massive galaxies from the MASSIVE survey. We find corrections on the distances of order $\sim 2-3\%$, resulting in a shift in the inferred best-fit values of the Hubble constant $H\_0$ of order $\Delta H\_0^{\rm{SN~Ia}}\approx 0.5 ~\rm{km}/\rm{s}/\rm{Mpc}$ and $\Delta H\_0^{\rm{SBF}}\approx 1.1 ~\rm{km}/\rm{s}/\rm{Mpc}$, seemingly worsening the Hubble tension.
