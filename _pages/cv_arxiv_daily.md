2024-07-02, **Neutrinos with refractive masses and the DESI BAO results**, Manibrata Sen et.al., [2407.02462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02462v1)

 Due to interactions with dark matter, neutrinos can acquire refractive masses which explain the data from oscillation experiments. We study the effects of relic neutrinos with refractive masses on structure formation in the Universe. In the model with a light fermionic mediator, above the resonance energy, $E\_R$, associated with the mass of the mediator, refractive masses have all the properties identical to the usual vacuum masses. Below the resonance, refractive masses decrease with neutrino energy, however, they cannot be used in the same way as usual masses. We study the dispersion relations and group velocities of such neutrinos and their dependence on redshift. We show that in the epoch of structure formation, relic neutrinos were ultrarelativistic and essentially massless particles for $E\_R = (10 - 10^5)\,$eV. This allows to reconcile the values of masses extracted from oscillation experiments with the stringent bounds on sum of neutrino masses from cosmological surveys.

2024-07-02, **Dark symmetry implication for right-handed neutrinos**, Phung Van Dong et.al., [2407.02324v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02324v1)

 We argue that the long-standing issues of neutrino mass and dark matter can be manifestly solved in a dark gauge symmetry $U(1)\_D$ that transforms nontrivially only for three right-handed neutrinos $\nu\_{1,2,3R}$ -- the counterparts of known left-handed neutrinos. This theory assigns $\nu\_{1,2,3R}$ dark charge to be $D=0$, $-1$, and $+1$, respectively, in order for anomaly cancelation. Additionally, it imposes an inert Higgs doublet $\eta$ and two Higgs singlets $\xi,\phi$ with dark charge $D=+1$, $-1$, and $+2$, respectively. That said, the dark symmetry is broken by $\phi$ (by two units) down to a dark parity $P\_D=(-1)^D$, for which $\nu\_{2,3R}$ and $\eta,\xi$ are odd, whereas all other fields are even due to $D=0$. The lightest of these odd fields is stabilized by $P\_D$, responsible for dark matter. Neutrino masses are generated by a scotoseesaw scheme, in which the seesaw part is mediated by $\nu\_{1R}$, while the scotogenic part is mediated by $\nu\_{2,3R}$, for which the hierarchy of atmospheric and solar neutrino mass splittings is explained.

2024-07-01, **A magnetized strongly turbulent corona as the source of neutrinos from NGC 1068**, Damiano F. G. Fiorillo et.al., [2407.01678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01678v1)

 The cores of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are potential accelerators of 10-100 TeV cosmic rays, in turn producing high-energy neutrinos. This picture was confirmed by the compelling evidence of a TeV neutrino signal from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068, leaving open the question of which is the site and mechanism of cosmic ray acceleration. One candidate is the magnetized turbulence surrounding the central supermassive black hole. Recent particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence indicate that stochastic cosmic ray acceleration is non-resonant, in contrast to the assumptions of previous studies. We show that this has important consequences on a self-consistent theory of neutrino production in the corona, leading to a more rapid cosmic ray acceleration than previously considered. The turbulent magnetic field fluctuations needed to explain the neutrino signal are consistent with a magnetically powered corona. We find that strong turbulence, with turbulent magnetic energy density higher than $1\%$ of the rest mass energy density, naturally explains the normalization of the IceCube neutrino flux, in addition to the neutrino spectral shape. Only a fraction of the protons in the corona, which can be directly inferred from the neutrino signal, are accelerated to high energies. Thus, in this framework, the neutrino signal from NGC 1068 provides a testbed for particle acceleration in magnetized turbulence.

2024-07-01, **Dark Matter Raining on DUNE and Other Large Volume Detectors**, Javier F. Acevedo et.al., [2407.01670v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01670v1)

 Direct detection is a powerful means of searching for particle physics evidence of dark matter (DM) heavier than about a GeV with $\mathcal O(kiloton)$ volume, low-threshold detectors. In many scenarios, some fraction of the DM may be boosted to large velocities enhancing and generally modifying possible detection signatures. We investigate the scenario where 100% of the DM is boosted at the Earth due to new attractive long-range forces. This leads to two main improvements in detection capabilities: 1) the large boost allows for detectable signatures of DM well below a GeV at large-volume neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and JUNO, as possible DM detectors, and 2) the flux at the Earth's surface is enhanced by a focusing effect. In addition, the model leads to a significant anisotropy in the signal with the DM flowing dominantly vertically at the Earth's surface instead of the typical approximately isotropic DM signal. We develop the theory behind this model and also calculate realistic constraints using a detailed GENIE simulation of the signal inside detectors.

2024-07-01, **ALP leptogenesis**, Martina Cataldi et.al., [2407.01667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01667v1)

 We propose a novel realisation of leptogenesis that relies on the out-of-equilibrium decay of an axion-like particle (ALP) into right-handed Majorana neutrinos (RHNs) in the early Universe. With respect to standard thermal leptogenesis, our mechanism lowers by two orders of magnitude the RHN mass, or the tuning in the RHN mass splittings, needed to reproduce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and neutrino masses. We find that ALP leptogenesis requires $m\_a > 10^{4}$ GeV and $f\_a > 10^{11}$ GeV for the ALP mass and decay constant, and predicts an early period of matter domination induced by the ALP in parts of its parameter space. We finally provide a viable supersymmetric realisation of ALP leptogenesis where the ALP is the $R$-axion, which accommodates GeV gravitino dark matter and predicts RHN below 10 TeV.

2024-07-01, **Instrument Overview of Taurus: A Balloon-borne CMB and Dust Polarization Experiment**, Jared L. May et.al., [2407.01438v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01438v1)

 Taurus is a balloon-borne cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment optimized to map the E-mode polarization and Galactic foregrounds at the largest angular scales ($\ell$ $\lt$ 30) and improve measurements of the optical depth to reionization ($\tau$). This will pave the way for improved measurements of the sum of neutrino masses in combination with high-resolution CMB data while also testing the $\Lambda CDM$ model on large angular scales and providing high-frequency maps of polarized dust foregrounds to the CMB community. These measurements take advantage of the low-loading environment found in the stratosphere and are enabled by NASA's super-pressure balloon platform, which provides access to 70% of the sky with a launch from Wanaka, New Zealand. Here we describe a general overview of Taurus, with an emphasis on the instrument design. Taurus will employ more than 10,000 100 mK transition edge sensor bolometers distributed across two low-frequency (150, 220 GHz) and one high-frequency (280, 350 GHz) dichroic receivers. The liquid helium cryostat housing the detectors and optics is supported by a lightweight gondola. The payload is designed to meet the challenges in mass, power, and thermal control posed by the super-pressure platform. The instrument and scan strategy are optimized for rigorous control of instrumental systematics, enabling high-fidelity linear polarization measurements on the largest angular scales.

2024-07-01, **3U Transat: a cubesat constellation to boost the multi-messenger astronomy**, Jean-Yves Heloret et.al., [2407.01352v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01352v1)

 Thanks to the advent of sensitive gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino detectors, multi-messenger (MM) astronomy will deeply transform our understanding of the Universe contents and evolution over cosmological times. To fully exploit the forthcoming GW and neutrino discoveries, it is crucial to detect as many electromagnetic (EM) counterparts as possible, but up to now, only one event has been detected by both GW detectors (Ligo/Virgo) and electromagnetic detectors (Fermi/GBM (Gamma ray Burst Monitor) and Integral), the short gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A/GW 170817 associated with the merger of a binary neutron star. To help improving the rate of joint MM events, it is crucial for the EM detectors in particular at high-energy in space to observe all the sky with a decent sensitivity. To do so, we propose the development of 3U Transat (TRANsient sky SATellites) project. 3U Transat is a constellation of nano-satellites offering a full sky coverage with a limited investment. The goal of this article is to present the 3U Transat project and its main scientific drivers as well as its current status. We will also describe our dynamic simulator used to optimise the scientific performances of the constellation. We will show highlights of the expected performances in term of detection and localisation capabilities as a function of the number of satellites in the constellation.

2024-07-01, **Probing the connection between IceCube neutrinos and MOJAVE AGN**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2407.01351v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01351v1)

 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are prime candidate sources of the high-energy, astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. This is demonstrated by the real-time multi-messenger detection of the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the recent evidence of neutrino emission from NGC 1068 from a separate time-averaged study. However, the production mechanism of the astrophysical neutrinos in AGN is not well established which can be resolved via correlation studies with photon observations. For neutrinos produced due to photohadronic interactions in AGN, in addition to a correlation of neutrinos with high-energy photons, there would also be a correlation of neutrinos with photons emitted at radio wavelengths. In this work, we perform an in-depth stacking study of the correlation between 15 GHz radio observations of AGN reported in the MOJAVE XV catalog, and ten years of neutrino data from IceCube. We also use a time-dependent approach which improves the statistical power of the stacking analysis. No significant correlation was found for both analyses and upper limits are reported. When compared to the IceCube diffuse flux, at 100 TeV and for a spectral index of 2.5, the upper limits derived are $\sim3\%$ and $\sim9\%$ for the time-averaged and time-dependent case, respectively.

2024-07-01, **Search for a light sterile neutrino with 7.5 years of IceCube DeepCore data**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2407.01314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01314v1)

 We present a search for an eV-scale sterile neutrino using 7.5 years of data from the IceCube DeepCore detector. The analysis uses a sample of 21,914 events with energies between 5 and 150 GeV to search for sterile neutrinos through atmospheric muon neutrino disappearance. Improvements in event selection and treatment of systematic uncertainties provide greater statistical power compared to previous DeepCore sterile neutrino searches. Our results are compatible with the absence of mixing between active and sterile neutrino states, and we place constraints on the mixing matrix elements $\|U\_{\mu 4}\|^2 < 0.0534$ and $\|U\_{\tau 4}\|^2 < 0.0574$ at 90% CL under the assumption that $\Delta m^2\_{41}\geq 1\;\mathrm{eV^2}$. These null results add to the growing tension between anomalous appearance results and constraints from disappearance searches in the 3+1 sterile neutrino landscape.

2024-07-01, **Flaires: A Comprehensive Catalog of Dust-Echo-like Infrared Flares**, Jannis Necker et.al., [2407.01039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01039v1)

 Context: Observations of transient emission from extreme accretion events onto supermassive black holes can reveal conditions in the center of galaxies and the black hole itself. Most recently, they have been suggested to be emitters of high-energy neutrinos. If it is suddenly rejuvenated accretion or a tidal disruption event (TDE) is not clear in most cases. Aims: We expanded on existing samples of infrared flares to compile the largest and most complete list available. A large sample size is necessary to provide high enough statistics for far away and faint objects to estimate their rate. Our catalog is large enough to facilitate a preliminary study of the rate evolution with redshift for the first time. Methods: We compiled a sample of 40 million galaxies, and, using a custom, publicly available pipeline, analyzed the WISE light curves for these 40 million objects using the Bayesian Blocks algorithm. We selected promising candidates for dust echos of transient accretion events and inferred the luminosity, extension, and temperature of the hot dust by fitting a blackbody spectrum. Results: We established a clean sample of 823 dust-echo-like infrared flares, of which we can estimate the dust properties for 568. After removing 70 objects with possible contribution by synchrotron emission, the luminosity, extension, and temperature are consistent with dust echos. Estimating the dust extension from the light curve shape revealed that the duration of the incident flare is broadly compatible with the duration of TDEs. The resulting rate per galaxy is consistent with the latest measurements of infrared-detected TDEs and appears to decline at increasing redshift. Conclusions: Although systematic uncertainties may impact the calculation of the rate evolution, this catalog will enable further research in phenomena related to dust-echos from TDEs and extreme accretion flares.

2024-07-01, **Neutrino oscillations originate from virtual excitation of Z bosons**, Shi-Biao Zheng et.al., [2407.00954v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00954v1)

 To account for neutrino oscillations, it is postulated that the neutrino has nonvanishing mass and each flavor eigenstate is formed by three distinct mass eigenstates, whose probability amplitudes interfere with each other during its propagation. However, I find that the energy conservation law requires these mass eigenstates, if they exist, to be entangled with distinct joint energy eigenstates of the other particles produced by the same weak interaction as the neutrino. This entanglement destroys the quantum coherence among the neutrino's mass eigenstates, which are responsible for flavor oscillations under the aforementioned postulation. I reveal that the neutrino oscillations actually originate from virtual excitation of the Z bosonic field diffusing over the space. During the propagation, the neutrino can continually excite and then immediately re-absorb a virtual Z boson. This virtual bosonic excitation produces a backaction on the neutrino, enabling it to oscillate among three flavors. When the neutrino propagates in matter, its behavior is determined by the competition between the coherent flavor transformation and decoherence effect resulting from scatterings.

2024-07-02, **Systematics in ETG Mass Profile Modelling: Strong Lensing & Stellar Dynamics**, Carlos R. Melo-Carneiro et.al., [2407.02297v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02297v1)

 Strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics are independent and powerful methods to probe the total gravitational potential of galaxies, and thus, their total mass profile. However, inherent degeneracies in the individual models makes it difficult to obtain a full understanding of the distribution of baryons and dark matter (DM), although such degeneracies might be broken by the combination of these two tracers, leading to more reliable measurements of the mass distribution of the lens galaxy. We use mock data from IllustrisTNG50 to compare how dynamical-only, lens-only, and joint modelling can constrain the mass distribution of early-type galaxies (ETGs). The joint model consistently outperforms the other models, achivieng a $2\%$ accuracy in recovering the total mass within $2.5R\_\text{eff}$. The Einstein radius is robustly recovered for both lens-only and joint models, with the first showing a median fractional error of $-5\%$ and the latter a fractional error consistent with zero. The stellar mass-to-light ratio and total mass density slope are well recovered by all models. In particular, the dynamical-only model achieves an accuracy of $1\%$ for the stellar mass-to-light ratio, while the accuracy of the mass density slope is typically of the order of $5\%$ for all models. However, all models struggle to constrain integrated quantities involving DM and the halo parameters. Nevertheless, imposing more restrictive assumptions on the DM halo, such as fixing the scale radius, could alleviate some of the issues. Finally, we verify that the number of kinematical constraints ($15, 35, 55$ bins) on the kinematical map does not impact the models outcomes.

2024-07-02, **Conversations in the dark: cross-correlating birefringence and LSS to constrain axions**, S. Arcari et.al., [2407.02144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02144v1)

 Unveiling the dark sector of the Universe is one of the leading efforts in theoretical physics. Among the many models proposed, axions and axion-like particles stand out due to their solid theoretical foundation, capacity to contribute significantly to both dark matter and dark energy, and potential to address the small-scale crisis of $\Lambda$CDM. Moreover, these pseudo-scalar fields couple to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons parity-violating term, leading to a rotation of the plane of linearly polarized waves, namely cosmic birefringence. We explore the impact of the axion-parameters on anisotropic birefringence and study, for the first time, its cross-correlation with the spatial distribution of galaxies, focusing on ultralight axions with masses $10^{-33}\,{\rm eV}\le m\_\phi\le10^{-28}\,{\rm eV}$. Through this novel approach, we investigate the axion-parameter space in the mass $m\_\phi$ and initial misalignment angle $\theta\_i$, within the framework of early dark energy models, and constrain the axion-photon coupling $g\_{\phi\gamma}$ required to achieve unity in the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying cross-correlation, computed with the instrument specifications of Euclid and forthcoming CMB-polarization data. Our findings reveal that for masses below $10^{-32}\,{\rm eV}$ and initial misalignment angles greater in absolute value than $\pi/4$, the signal-to-noise ratio not only exceeds unity but also surpasses that achievable from the auto-correlation of birefringence alone (up to a factor 7), highlighting the informative potential of this new probe. Additionally, given the late-time evolution of these low-mass axions, the signal stems from the epoch of reionization, providing an excellent tool to single out the birefringence generated during this period.

2024-07-02, **The interface of gravity and dark energy**, Kristen Lackeos et.al., [2407.02044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02044v1)

 At sufficiently large radii dark energy modifies the behavior of (a) bound orbits around a galaxy and (b) virialized gas in a cluster of galaxies. Dark energy also provides a natural cutoff to a cluster's dark matter halo. In (a) there exists a maximum circular orbit beyond which periodic motion is no longer possible, and orbital evolution near critical binding is analytically calculable using an adiabatic invariant integral. The finding implicates the study of wide galaxy pairs. In (b), dark energy necessitates the use of a generalized Virial Theorem to describe gas at the outskirts of a cluster. When coupled to the baryonic escape condition, aided by dark energy, the results is a radius beyond which the continued establishment of a hydrostatic halo of thermalized baryons is untenable. This leads to a theoretically motivated virial radius. We use this theory to probe the structure of a cluster's baryonic halo and apply it to X-ray and weak-lensing data collected on cluster Abell 1835. We find that gas in its outskirts deviates significantly from hydrostatic equilibrium beginning at $\sim 1.3\ {\rm Mpc}$, the `inner' virial radius. We also define a model dependent dark matter halo cutoff radius to A1835. The dark matter cutoff gives an upper limit to the cluster's total mass of $\sim7\times 10^{15}M\_{\odot}$. Moreover, it is possible to derive an `outer' hydrostatic equilibrium cutoff radius given a dark matter cutoff radius. A region of cluster gas transport and turbulence occurs between the inner and outer cutoff radii.

2024-07-01, **Tidal mass loss in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy through N-body simulations with Gaia EDR3-based orbits**, Pierfrancesco Di Cintio et.al., [2407.01714v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01714v1)

 The Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) represents a challenge for some globular cluster (GC) formation models, because an exceptionally high fraction of its stellar mass is locked in its GC system. In order to shed light on our understanding of GC formation, we aim to constrain the amount of stellar mass that Fornax has lost via tidal interaction with the Milky Way (MW). Exploiting the flexibility of effective multi-component $N$-body simulations and relying on state-of-the-art estimates of Fornax's orbital parameters, we study the evolution of the mass distribution of the Fornax dSph in observationally justified orbits in the gravitational potential of the MW over 12 Gyr. We find that, though the dark-matter mass loss can be substantial, the fraction of stellar mass lost by Fornax to the MW is always negligible, even in the most eccentric orbit considered. We conclude that stellar-mass loss due to tidal stripping is not a plausible explanation for the unexpectedly high stellar mass of the GC system of the Fornax dSph and we discuss quantitatively the implications for GC formation scenarios.

2024-07-01, **Electroweak-Charged Dark Matter and SO(10) Unification with Parity**, Matthew J. Baldwin et.al., [2407.01696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01696v1)

 We consider electroweak-charged dark matter in an $SO(10)$ unified theory that solves the strong $CP$ problem via Parity. Electroweak-charged dark matter has a colored $SO(10)$ partner, whose mass should be much above the dark matter mass to avoid cosmological problems arising from the decay of the colored partner. The mass hierarchy can be naturally achieved by an $SO(10)\times CP$ symmetry breaking Higgs that has a missing vacuum expectation value. The mass hierarchy, via quantum corrections to the gauge coupling constants, lowers the unification scale and enhances the proton decay rate. Hyper-Kamiokande will probe the parameter space with precise gauge coupling unification. We derive the range of the top quark mass and the strong coupling constant preferred by radiative Parity breaking by the Higgs Parity mechanism.

2024-07-01, **A central degeneracy induced outer core in fermionic dark matter halos**, Weikang Lin et.al., [2407.01690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01690v1)

 Several galaxy-scale observations challenge the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm based on cosmological simulations. The cusp-core problem is one of the most outstanding. However, current simulations are unable to consider quantum statistical effects. For a fermionic dark matter halo, a degenerate inner core induces an extended outer core that dominates in gravity in the region relevant for rotation curve observation. We study the properties of this outer core and show that its density and radius are correlated. The prediction remarkably agrees with the measured scaling relation in both the slope and the magnitude. Such consistency suggests that the observed cored profiles do not contradict massive dark matter but indicate its fermionic nature.

2024-07-01, **Axion Relic Pockets -- a theory of dark matter**, Pierluca Carenza et.al., [2407.01676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01676v1)

 We propose a new theory of dark matter based on axion physics and cosmological phase transitions. We show that theories in which a gauge coupling increases through a first-order phase transition naturally result in `axion relic pockets': regions of relic false vacua stabilised by the pressure from a kinematically trapped, hot axion gas. Axion relic pockets provide a viable and highly economical theory of dark matter: the macroscopic properties of the pockets depend only on a single parameter (the phase transition temperature). We describe the formation, evolution and present-day properties of axion relic pockets, and outline how their phenomenology is distinct from existing dark matter paradigms. We briefly discuss how laboratory experiments and astronomical observations can be used to test the theory, and identify gamma-ray observations of magnetised, dark-matter-dense environments as particularly promising.

2024-07-01, **Cosmic accretion shocks as a tool to measure the dark matter mass of galaxy clusters**, David Vallés-Pérez et.al., [2407.01660v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01660v1)

 Cosmological accretion shocks created during the formation of galaxy clusters are a ubiquitous phenomenon all around the Universe. These shocks, and their features, are intimately related with the gravitational energy put into play during galaxy cluster formation. Studying a sample of simulated galaxy clusters and their associated accretion shocks, we show that objects in our sample sit in a plane within the three dimensional-space of cluster total mass, shock radius, and Mach number (a measure of shock intensity). Using this relation, and considering that forthcoming new observations will be able to measure shock radii and intensities, we put forward the idea that the dark matter content of galaxy clusters could be indirectly measured with an error up to around 30 per cent at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. This procedure would be a new and independent method to measure the dark matter mass in cosmic structures, and a novel constraint to the accepted $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

2024-07-01, **Unveiling desert region in inert doublet model assisted by Peccei-Quinn symmetry**, Anupam Ghosh et.al., [2407.01415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01415v1)

 The Inert Higgs Doublet model (IDM), assisted by Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, offers a simple but natural framework of a dark sector that accommodates Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) and axion as dark matter components. Spontaneous breaking of $U(1)\_{PQ}$ symmetry, which was originally proposed as an elegant solution to the strong charge-parity (CP) problem, also ensures the stability of WIMP through a residual $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ symmetry. Interestingly, additional fields necessitated by PQ symmetry further enrich the dark sector. These include a scalar field proprietor for axion DM and a vector-like quark (VLQ) that acts as a portal for the dark sector through Yukawa interactions. Moreover, this combination of the axion and WIMP components satisfies the observed DM relic density and reopens the phenomenologically exciting region of the IDM parameter space where the WIMP mass falls between 100 - 550 GeV. We investigate the model-independent pair production of VLQs exploring this region at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), incorporating the effects of next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections. After production, each VLQ decays into a top or bottom quark accompanied by an inert scalar, a consequence of the residual $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ symmetry. Utilising relevant observables with a leptonic search channel and employing multivariate analysis, we demonstrate the ability of this analysis to exclude a significant portion of the parameter space with an integrated luminosity of 300 $\text{fb}^{-1}$.

2024-07-01, **PineTree: A generative, fast, and differentiable halo model for wide-field galaxy surveys**, Simon Ding et.al., [2407.01391v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01391v1)

 Mock halo catalogues are indispensable data products for developing and validating cosmological inference pipelines. A major challenge in generating mock catalogues is modelling the halo or galaxy bias, which is the mapping from matter density to dark matter halos or observable galaxies. To this end, N-body codes produce state-of-the-art catalogues. However, generating large numbers of these N-body simulations for big volumes, requires significant computational time. We introduce and benchmark a differentiable and physics-informed neural network that can generate mock halo catalogues of comparable quality to those obtained from full N-body codes. The model design is computationally efficient for the training procedure and the production of large mock suites. We present a neural network, relying only on 18 to 34 trainable parameters, that produces halo catalogues from dark matter overdensity fields. The reduction of network weights is realised through incorporating symmetries motivated by first principles into our model architecture. We train our model using dark matter only N-body simulations across different resolutions, redshifts, and mass bins. We validate the final mock catalogues by comparing them to N-body halo catalogues using different N-point correlation functions. Our model produces mock halo catalogues consistent with the reference simulations, showing that this novel network is a promising way to generate mock data for upcoming wide-field surveys due to its computational efficiency. Moreover, we find that the network can be trained on approximate overdensity fields to reduce the computational cost further. We also present how the trained network parameters can be interpreted to give insights into the physics of structure formation. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of our model as well as more general requirements and pitfalls for approximate halo mock generation.

2024-07-01, **Nonparametric signal separation in very-high-energy gamma ray observations with probabilistic neural networks**, Marion Ullmo et.al., [2407.01329v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01329v1)

 An intriguing challenge in observational astronomy is the separation signals in areas where multiple signals intersect. A typical instance of this in very-high-energy (VHE, E$\gtrsim$100 GeV) gamma-ray astronomy is the issue of residual background in observations. This background arises when cosmic-ray protons are mistakenly identified as gamma-rays from sources of interest, thereby blending with signals from astrophysical sources of interest. We introduce a deep ensemble approach to determine a non-parametric estimation of source and background signals in VHE gamma observations, as well as a likelihood-derived epistemic uncertainty on these estimations. We rely on minimal assumptions, exploiting the separability of space and energy components in the signals, and defining a small region in coordinate space where the source signal is assumed to be negligible compared to background signal. The model is applied both on mock observations, including a simple toy case and a realistic simulation of dark matter annihilation in the Galactic center, as well as true observations from the public H.E.S.S. data release, specifically datasets of the Crab nebula and the pulsar wind nebula MSH 15-52. Our method performs well in mock cases, where the ground truth is known, and compares favorably against conventional physical analysis approaches when applied to true observations. In the case of the mock dark matter signal in the Galactic center, our work opens new avenues for component separation in this complex region of the VHE sky.

2024-07-01, **Gemini Dark Matter**, Andrew Cheek et.al., [2407.01099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01099v1)

 The $S\_8/\sigma\_8$ tension in the large scale structure can be explained by decaying dark matter with an almost degenerate spectrum and small enough decay width. Here we propose the Gemini dark matter model, which contains a heavy mother particle $\chi\_3$ and two twins $\chi\_{1/2}$ which are almost degenerate in mass and are produced at the same time. The dark sector is charged under the same Froggatt-Nielsen symmetry that can explain the hierarchy of the Standard model Yukawa couplings. The slightly heavier $\chi\_2$ decays into $\chi\_1$ and the axionic component of the flavon, which washes out the small scale structure and resolves $S\_8/\sigma\_8$ tension. We present the production mechanism of Gemini dark matter and viable parameter regions. We find that despite the preferred dark matter mass being $\mathcal{O}(1)$--$\mathcal{O}(100)$ keV, they constitute cold dark matter. The Gemini dark matter model predicts an abundance of dark radiation that will be probed in future measurements of the CMB.

2024-07-01, **Indirect detection constraints on semi-annihilation of inert scalar multiplets**, Hugues Beauchesne et.al., [2407.01096v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01096v1)

 Certain models of inert multiplets allow for semi-annihilation processes, in which two dark matter candidates annihilate to a dark matter particle and a non-dark matter particle. The existence of these processes can alleviate certain constraints and substantially modify the indirect detection signal. In this paper, we study current indirect detection constraints on the semi-annihilation of inert scalar multiplets. We show that there exist gauge numbers for which dark matter can be thermally produced and be compatible with indirect detection constraints even for very cuspy galactic dark matter density profiles.

 The ultralight dark photon is one of intriguing dark matter candidates. The interaction between the visible photon and dark photon is introduced by the gauge kinetic mixing between the field strength tensors of the Abelian gauge groups in the Standard Model and dark sector. The relativistic electrodynamics was generalized to quantum electromagnetodynamics (QEMD) in the presence of both electric and magnetic charges. The photon is described by two four-potentials corresponding to two $U(1)$ gauge groups and satisfying non-trivial commutation relations. In this work, we construct the low-energy dark photon-photon interactions in the framework of QEMD and obtain new dark photon-photon kinetic mixings. The consequent field equations and the new Maxwell's equations are derived in this framework. We also investigate the detection strategies of dark photon as light dark matter as well as the generic kinetic mixings at haloscope experiments.

 We introduce the spin-1 $U(1)\_X$ gauged field $X$ with $Z\_2$ odd dark parity for evading the current strong constraints for the kinetic mixing. Then, $X$ becomes stable and a candidate for the dark matter. The lowest mass dimension of interaction is six, and the type is like Higgs portal. Two types of dim-6 operators are introduced. We consider the freeze-out dark matter scenario. With the limit of null momentum transfer, a parity odd operator is free from the direct detection constraints. Accordingly, the strong constraints on a parity even operator indicate turning on this parity odd operator to realize the dark matter relic density of the universe. With the 1 TeV cut-off scale, our dark matter of around 400 GeV mass can explain the dark matter relic density and is allowed from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment of the direct detection.

 We propose a two-field inflationary model with the induced gravity term. Using conformal transformation of the metric, we get the chiral cosmological model with two scalar fields. We demonstrate that the constructed inflationary model do not contradict to observation data and is suitable for primordial black hole (PBH) formation. The estimation of PBH masses allows to consider PBHs as dark matter candidates.

 We investigate dark matter (DM)-electron scattering in a minimal $U(1)\_X$ extension of the Standard Model (SM), where the DM can appear as a Majorana fermion, a complex singlet scalar or a Dirac fermion. To study bounds on the $U(1)\_X$ gauge coupling $(g\_X)$ and new gauge boson mass $(M\_{Z^\prime})$, from DM-electron scattering, we consider several direct search experiments like CDMS, DAMIC, SENSEI, PandaX-II, DarkSide-50 and XENON1T-S2 for different $U(1)\_X$ charges. In this set-up we consider DM production via freeze-in both in radiation dominated and modified cosmological background to project sensitivities on $g\_X-M\_{Z^\prime}$ plane satisfying observed relic abundance. DM-electron scattering could provide comparable, or even stronger bounds than those obtained from the electron/ muon $(g-2)$, low energy scattering and intensity frontier experiments within 0.01 GeV $\lesssim M\_{Z^\prime} \lesssim$ 0.1 GeV. Constrains from freeze-in could provide stronger sensitivities for $M\_{Z^\prime}\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV, however, these limits are comparable to those obtained from LHCb, LEP experiments for $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV $\lesssim M\_{Z^\prime} \lesssim 150$ GeV. In future, electron-muon scattering (MUonE), proton (FASER, DUNE) and electron/positron (ILC) beam dump experiments could probe these parameters.

2024-07-02, **Cubic Galileon Gravity in the CMB**, Gen Ye et.al., [2407.02471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02471v1)

 Among the models addressing the Hubble tension, those introducing a dynamical dark component around recombination have been the most promising thus far. Their study has highlighted that, in fact, cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observations can allow for such components before and near recombination.   The new dynamical degree of freedom can be early dark energy (EDE) or early modified gravity depending on its coupling to gravity. We study a new model, $\mathcal{G}$EDE, featuring the cubic Galileon operator $X\Box\phi$ and test it against the most recent Planck PR4 CMB and Cepheid calibrated Pantheon+ type Ia Supernovae data. Thanks to the kinetic braiding effects, $\mathcal{G}$EDE gives a better fit to the data, with a higher $H\_0$, and is preferred over the canonical EDE with a Bayes factor $\ln B=0.9$, despite introducing one more parameter. This calls for further explorations of modified gravity near and before last scattering. To facilitate these, we introduce a substantial extension of the cosmological code \texttt{EFTCAMB} that allows to fully evolve the background and linear dynamics of any covariant theory, oscillatory or not, belonging to the Horndeski class.

2024-07-02, **A new bump in the night: evidence of a new feature in the binary black hole mass distribution at $70~M_{\odot}$ from gravitational-wave observations**, Ignacio Magaña Hernandez et.al., [2407.02460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02460v1)

 We analyze the confident binary black hole (BBH) detections from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) with an alternative mass population model in order to capture features in the mass distribution beyond the Powerlaw + Peak model. We find that the peak of a second power law characterizes the $\sim 30-35~ M\_\odot$ bump, such that the data marginally prefers a mixture of two power laws for the mass distribution of binary components over a Powerlaw + Peak model with a Bayes Factor $\log\_{10}\mathcal{B}$ of 0.1. This result may imply that the $\sim 30-35~ M\_\odot$ feature represents the onset of a second population of BBH mergers (e.g. from a dynamical formation channel) rather than a specific mass feature over a broader distribution. When an additional Gaussian bump is allowed within our power law mixture model, we find a new feature in the BH mass spectrum at $\sim65-70~M\_\odot$. This new feature may be consistent with hierarchical mergers, and constitute $\sim2\%$ of the BBH population. This model also recovers a maximum mass of $58^{+30}\_{-14}~M\_\odot$ for the second power law, consistent with the onset of a pair-instability supernova mass gap.

2024-07-02, **Extended Uncertainty Principle: A Deeper Insight into the Hubble Tension?**, Kourosh Nozari et.al., [2407.01961v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01961v1)

 The standard cosmological model, known as the LambdaCDM model, has been successful in many respects, but it has some significant discrepancies, some of which have not been resolved yet. In measuring the Hubble-Lematre parameter, there is an apparent discrepancy which is known as the Hubble tension, defined as differences in values of this parameter measured by the Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) data (a model-independent method) and by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation maps (a model-dependent method). Although many potential solutions have been proposed, the issue still remains unresolved. Recently, it was observed that the Hubble tension can be due to the concept of uncertainty in measuring cosmological parameters at large distance scales through applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) in cosmological setups. Extending this pioneering idea, in the present study we plan to incorporate the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) containing a minimal fundamental measurable momentum (or equivalently, a maximal fundamental measurable length) as a candidate setup for describing large-scale effects of Quantum Gravity (QG) to address the Hubble tension and constrain the EUP length scale. In this regard, by finding a relevant formula for the effective photon rest mass in terms of the present-time value of the Hubble-Lematre parameter, we see that discrepancies in the value of photon rest mass associated with the Hubble-Lematre parameter values estimated from model-independent and model-dependent methods perhaps is the cause of Hubble tension.

2024-07-01, **Accurate measurement of telescope filter bandpasses with a Collimated Beam Projector and impact on cosmological parameters**, Jérémy Neveu et.al., [2407.01650v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01650v1)

 The measurement of magnitudes with different filters in photometric surveys gives access to cosmological distances and parameters. However, for current and future large surveys like the ZTF, DES, HSC or LSST, the photometric calibration uncertainties are almost comparable to statistical uncertainties in the error budget of type Ia cosmology analysis, which limits our ability to use type Ia supernovae for precision cosmology. The knowledge of the bandpasses of the survey filters at the per-mill level can help reach the sub-percent precision for magnitudes. We show how a misknowledge of the bandpasses central wavelengths or of the presence of out-of-band leakages leads to biased cosmological measurements. Then, we present how to measure the filter throughputs at the required precision with a Collimated Beam Projector.

2024-07-01, **Combining pre- and post-recombination new physics to address cosmological tensions: case study with varying electron mass and a sign-switching cosmological constant**, Yo Toda et.al., [2407.01173v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01173v1)

 It has recently been argued that the Hubble tension may call for a combination of both pre- and post-recombination new physics. Motivated by these considerations, we provide one of the first concrete case studies aimed at constructing such a viable combination. We consider models that have individually worked best on either end of recombination so far: a spatially uniform time-varying electron mass leading to earlier recombination (also adding non-zero spatial curvature), and a sign-switching cosmological constant inducing an AdS-to-dS transition within the $\Lambda\_{\rm s}$CDM model. When confronted against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Type Ia Supernovae data, we show that no combination of these ingredients can successfully solve the Hubble tension. We find that the matter density parameter $\Omega\_m$ plays a critical role, driving important physical scales in opposite directions: the AdS-to-dS transition requires a larger $\Omega\_m$ to maintain the CMB acoustic scale fixed, whereas the varying electron mass requires a smaller $\Omega\_m$ to maintain the redshift of matter-radiation equality fixed. Despite the overall failure, we use our results to draw general model-building lessons, highlighting the importance of assessing tension-solving directions in the parameter space of new physics parameters and how these correlate with shifts in other standard parameters, while underscoring the crucial role of $\Omega\_m$ in this sense.

2024-07-01, **Properties of supernova remnants in SIGNALS galaxies -- I . NGC 6822 and M33**, Salvador Duarte Puertas et.al., [2407.01153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01153v1)

 We present a spatially resolved study of the kinematical properties of known supernova remnants (SNRs) in the nearest galaxies of the SIGNALS survey, namely NGC 6822 (one object) and M33 (163 objects), based on data obtained with the SITELLE Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (iFTS) at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The purpose of this paper is to provide a better scheme of identification for extragalactic SNRs and, in particular, to distinguish between HII regions and SNRs. For that we have used diagrams which involve both the [SII]/H$\alpha$ ratio and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$). We also introduce a new parameter, $\xi = {[SII] \over H\alpha} \times \sigma$, which enhances still the contrast between SNRs and the rest of the ionised gas. More than 90\% of the SNRs in our entire sample show an integrated [SII]/H$\alpha$ ratio larger than the canonical value (0.4). 86\% of the SNRs present in our field show a significant velocity dispersion. The spectral resolution of our observations allows us to observe the complex velocity structure of some SNRs.

2024-07-01, **On the importance of Earth's atmosphere for SNIa precision cosmology**, Jérémy Neveu et.al., [2407.01058v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01058v1)

 The measurement of colours in photometric surveys is a path to get access to cosmological distances. But for future large surveys like the Large Survey of Space and Time undertaken by the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, the large statistical power of the promised catalogues will make the photometric calibration uncertainties dominant in the error budget and will limit our ability to use it for precision cosmology. The knowledge of the in situ atmospheric transmission for each exposure, each season and on average for the entire survey can help reaching the subpercent precision for magnitudes. I will show the impact of precipitable water vapour during a cosmological survey on supernova cosmology. Then I will present how AuxTel at the Vera Rubin Observatory have the capability to measure the on-site atmospheric transmission in real time to improve LSST photometric calibration for precision cosmology.

2024-07-01, **Runaway BN supergiant star HD 93840: Progenitor of an imminent core-collapse supernova above the Galactic plane**, D. Weßmayer et.al., [2407.01037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01037v1)

 We present a quantitative spectral analysis of the extreme nitrogen-enhanced supergiant HD 93840 (BN1 Ib) at an intermediate galactic latitude. Based on an optical high-resolution spectrum and complementary ultraviolet and infrared (spectro-)photometry, in addition to Gaia data, we carried out a full characterisation of the star's properties. We used both hydrostatic and unified (photosphere+wind) model atmospheres that account for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium. A highly unusual surface CNO-mixing signature and a marked stellar overluminosity compared to the mass imply a binary channel for the star's past evolution. The kinematics shows that it has reached its current position above the Galactic plane as a runaway star, likely ejected by the supernova explosion of its former companion star. Its current bulk composition, with a notably increased mean molecular weight due to core He- and progressed shell H-burning, suggests an advanced evolutionary stage. It is poised to yield a rare core-collapse supernova of a blue supergiant about ten OB star population scale heights above the Galactic disk relatively soon, contributing to the metal enrichment of the circumgalactic medium.
