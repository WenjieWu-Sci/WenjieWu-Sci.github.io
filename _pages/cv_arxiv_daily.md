2025-06-10, **The Highest-Energy Neutrino Event Constrains Dark Matter-Neutrino Interactions**, Toni Bertólez-Martínez et.al., [2506.08993v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08993v1)

 Dark Matter-neutrino interactions affect the propagation of astrophysical neutrinos, attenuating the flux of neutrinos arriving at Earth. Using the highest-energy neutrino event detected to date by the KM3NeT collaboration as an example, and assuming an extragalactic origin, we derive limits on these interactions at $E\_\nu = 220^{+570}\_{-110}\, \mathrm{PeV}$. Considering only the propagation on the Milky Way Dark Matter halo, we constrain the interaction cross section over the mass of the Dark Matter candidate to be, $\sigma\_{\rm DM-\nu}/m\_{\rm DM} \lesssim 10^{-22}$~cm$^2$~GeV$^{-1}$. If a transient source was positively identified, the high-energy neutrino would have crossed the dark-matter halo of the source host as well, resulting in more stringent constraints (e.g., up to $ \sim$ 6 orders of magnitude assuming the blazar PKS 0605-085 is the source). These bounds on the Dark Matter-neutrino interaction cross section are translated into limits on the mass of the Dark Matter candidate, the mass of the mediator, and the coupling strength for different simplified models. In particular, we find that the KM3-230213A high-energy event sets the most stringent constraints on models where the scattering cross section rises in the high-energy limit. We identify vector Dark Matter interacting with neutrinos via vector mediators as the most promising scenario, and show that high-energy neutrinos provide world-leading limits in this model, testing the region of parameter space motivated by thermal freeze-out.

 In this new era of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, various new transients and new phenomena are constantly being discovered thanks to the rapid advances in observations, which provide the excellent opportunity to study the physics in the extreme environments. The enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP), planned to be launched in 2030, has several key advantages, including advanced polarimetry, high sensitivity & large effective area, and wide energy range coverage, which make it a groundbreaking project in high-energy astrophysics. In this article, we briefly introduce the potential time-domain and multi-messenger targets for eXTP, including gravitational-wave (GW) counterparts, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), supernovae, high energy neutrinos and TeV active galactic nucleus (AGNs), and so on. We discuss the advantages of future eXTP observations for detecting these sources, their detection capabilities, the abilities to distinguish theoretical models, and their applications in gravity and cosmology.

2025-06-09, **Bulk Viscosity of Two-Flavor Color Superconducting Quark Matter in Neutron Star Mergers**, Mark Alford et.al., [2506.08144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08144v1)

 This work investigates the bulk viscosity of warm, dense,   neutrino-transparent, color-superconducting quark matter, where   damping of density oscillations in the kHz frequency range arises   from weak-interaction-driven direct Urca processes involving   quarks. We study the two-flavor red-green paired   color-superconducting (2SC) phase, while allowing for the presence   of unpaired strange quarks and blue color light quarks of all   flavors. Our calculations are based on the SU(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio   (NJL) model, extended to include both vector interactions and the   't Hooft determinant term. The primary focus is on how variations in   the NJL Lagrangian parameters - specifically, the diquark and vector   coupling strengths - affect both the static properties of quark   matter, such as its equation of state and composition, and its   dynamical behavior, including bulk viscosity and associated damping   timescales. We find that the bulk viscosity and corresponding   damping timescale can change by more than an order of magnitude upon   varying the vector coupling by a factor of two at high densities and   by a lesser degree at lower densities. This sensitivity primarily   arises from the susceptibility of 2SC matter, with a smaller   contribution from modifications to the weak interaction rates. In   comparison, changes in the diquark coupling have a more limited   impact. The damping of density oscillations in 2SC matter is similar   quantitatively to nucleonic matter and can be a leading mechanism of   dissipation in merging hybrid stars containing color superconducting   cores.

2025-06-09, **Nucleon Decays into Light New Particles in Neutrino Detectors**, Julian Heeck et.al., [2506.08090v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08090v1)

 Proton and neutron decays into light new particles $X$ can drastically change the experimental signatures and benefit from the complementarity of large water-Cherenkov neutrino detectors such as Super/Hyper-Kamiokande and tracking detectors such as JUNO and DUNE. The proton decays $p\to \ell^+ X$ and $p\to \pi^+ X$ with $m\_X$ near phase-space closure lead to charged particles below Cherenkov threshold, rendering them practically invisible in Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande but not in JUNO and DUNE, which are therefore uniquely positioned for these baryon-number-violating signatures despite their smaller size. As an additional signature, such nucleon decays in Earth can produce a sizable flux of $X$ particles in underground detectors. We present a simple model in which nucleons decay into sub-GeV sterile neutrinos that subsequently decay through active-sterile neutrino mixing, with a promisingly large number of events in Super-Kamiokande even in the seesaw-motivated parameter space.

2025-06-09, **Impostor Among $ν$s: Dark Radiation Masquerading as Self-Interacting Neutrinos**, Anirban Das et.al., [2506.08085v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08085v1)

 Multiple cosmological observations hint at neutrino self-interactions beyond the Standard Model, yet such interactions face severe constraints from terrestrial experiments. We resolve this tension by introducing a model where active neutrinos resonantly convert to self-interacting dark radiation after BBN but before CMB epoch. This exploits the fact that cosmological observables cannot distinguish between neutrinos and dark radiation with the same abundance and free-streaming properties. Our mechanism, based on a simple Type-I seesaw framework along with a keV-scale scalar mediator, achieves two objectives: (1) it produces strongly self-interacting dark radiation that imitates neutrino self-interactions favored by cosmological data, and (2) it depletes the active neutrino energy density, relaxing cosmological neutrino mass bounds and easing the tension with neutrino oscillation data. The model naturally evades laboratory constraints through suppression of the neutrino-mediator coupling by the squared mass ratio of active and sterile neutrinos. We demonstrate how this scenario is favored over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined Planck and DESI data, while being consistent with all other constraints. Our mechanism is testable in future laboratory probes of absolute neutrino mass and searches for sterile neutrinos.

2025-06-09, **Discovering the Higgsino at CTAO-North within the Decade**, Shotaro Abe et.al., [2506.08084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08084v1)

 We demonstrate that higgsino dark matter (DM) could be discovered within the next few years using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory's soon-to-be-operational northern site (CTAO-North). A 1.1 TeV thermal higgsino is a highly motivated yet untested model of DM. Despite its strong theoretical motivation in supersymmetry and beyond, the higgsino is notoriously difficult to detect; it lies deep within the neutrino fog of direct detection experiments and could pose a challenge even for a future muon collider. We show that, in contrast, higgsino detection could be possible within this decade with CTAO-North in La Palma, Spain. The Galactic Center is the region where the dominant DM annihilation signature emerges, but it only barely rises above the horizon at the CTAO-North site. However, we project that this challenge can be overcome with large-zenith-angle observations at the northern site, enabling the conclusive detection of a higgsino signal by 2030 for a range of DM density profiles in the inner Galaxy.

2025-06-09, **Towards AI-assisted Neutrino Flavor Theory Design**, Jason Benjamin Baretz et.al., [2506.08080v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08080v1)

 Particle physics theories, such as those which explain neutrino flavor mixing, arise from a vast landscape of model-building possibilities. A model's construction typically relies on the intuition of theorists. It also requires considerable effort to identify appropriate symmetry groups, assign field representations, and extract predictions for comparison with experimental data. We develop an Autonomous Model Builder (AMBer), a framework in which a reinforcement learning agent interacts with a streamlined physics software pipeline to search these spaces efficiently. AMBer selects symmetry groups, particle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable models while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate our approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration to a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the context of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning with physics software feedback may be extended to other theoretical model-building problems in the future.

2025-06-09, **Resonant neutrino self-interactions: insights from the full shape galaxy power spectrum**, Hernán E. Noriega et.al., [2506.07994v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07994v1)

 This paper investigates resonant neutrino self-interactions in cosmology by employing, for the first time, the effective field theory of large-scale structure to model their impact on the matter distribution up to mildly nonlinear scales. We explore a broad range of mediator masses in two main analyses: one combining BOSS Full Shape (FS) galaxy clustering with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and another combining FS with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Our results place the strongest cosmological constraints to date on the resonant self interactions when using FS+Planck data, reaching up to $g\_\nu< 10.8 \times 10^{-14}$ at $95\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator. Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g\_\nu < 7.33 \times 10^{-12}$ at $95\%$ confidence. Our results suggest that resonant neutrino self-interactions are unlikely to resolve existing cosmological tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.

2025-06-09, **Probing Planck scale effects on absolute mass limit in neutrino flavor evolution**, Kartik Joshi et.al., [2506.07588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07588v1)

 This work explores how the generalized uncertainty principle, a theoretical modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle inspired by quantum gravity, affects neutrino flavor oscillations. By extending the standard two-flavor neutrino model, we show that the oscillation probability acquires an additional phase term that depends on the square roots of the neutrino masses, introducing new features beyond the conventional mass-squared differences. To account for the non-Hermitian nature of the resulting dynamics, we employ parity-time (PT) symmetric quantum mechanics, which allows for consistent descriptions of systems with balanced gain and loss. We analyze the feasibility of observing these effects in current and future neutrino experiments, such as DUNE, JUNO, IceCube, and KATRIN, and find that the predicted modifications could lie within experimental sensitivity. Moreover, we propose that analog quantum simulation platforms, such as cold atoms, trapped ions, and photonic systems, offer a promising route to test these predictions under controlled conditions. Our findings suggest that neutrino oscillations may serve as an effective probe of quantum gravity effects, providing a novel connection between fundamental theory and experimental observables.

2025-06-09, **Power Spectrum Emulators from Neural Networks and Tree-Based Methods**, Andrei Lazanu et.al., [2506.07514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07514v1)

 We use two subsets of 2000 and 1000 \textsc{Quijote} simulations to build two power spectrum emulators, allowing for fast computations of the non-linear matter power spectrum. The first emulator works on scales $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$ in terms of seven cosmological parameters: the matter and baryon fraction of the energy density of the Universe $\Omega\_m$ and $\Omega\_b$, the reduced Hubble constant $h$, the scalar spectral index $n\_s$, the amplitude of matter density fluctuations $\sigma\_8$, the total neutrino mass $M\_{\nu}$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. The power spectra can be directly determined at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3, while for intermediate redshifts these can be interpolated. The second emulator is based on five cosmological parameters, $\Omega\_m$, $h$, $n\_s$, $\sigma\_8$ and the amplitude of equilateral non-Gaussianity $f\_{\rm NL}^{\rm equilateral}$, at redshifts 0, 0.503, 0.733, 0.997 for $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$. The emulators are built on machine learning techniques. In both cases we have investigated both neural networks and tree-based methods and we have shown that the best accuracy is obtained for a neural network with two hidden layers. Both emulators achieve a root-mean-squared relative error of less then 5\% for all the redshifts considered on the scales discussed.

2025-06-10, **Measurement of the Dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$Galaxy Cross-Power Spectrum with the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog**, Haochen Wang et.al., [2506.08932v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08932v1)

 The dispersion of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) can serve as a powerful probe of the diffuse plasma between and surrounding galaxies, which contains most of the Universe's baryons. By cross-correlating the dispersion of background FRBs with the locations of foreground galaxies, we can study the relative spatial distributions of plasma and galaxies on scales of 0.1 to 50 Mpc, which are strongly affected by feedback processes in galaxy formation. Here we present the measurement of the dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy angular cross-power spectrum between 2873 FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog and nearly 6 million galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Over five photometric galaxy redshift bins spanning $0.05 < z <0.5$ and at 5.1$\sigma$ significance, we make the first definitive detection of spatial correlations in FRB dispersion measure due to cosmic structure. While parameter inferences should be interpreted with caution because of incomplete modelling of both the signal and systematic errors, our data indicate that the plasma$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy cross-power spectrum cuts off relative to the matter power spectrum at a scale $k\_\textrm{cut}^{-1}=0.9^{+0.4}\_{-0.4}\,\textrm{Mpc}$. This scale is consistent with those X-ray stacking analyses that suggest dark-matter halos with group-scale masses are largely evacuated of their baryons by feedback processes. Our study demonstrates that FRBs are promising tools to discern the physics of baryonic structure formation and will only become more powerful as FRB surveys expand.

2025-06-10, **Testing scalar dark matter clumps with Pulsar Timing Arrays**, Philippe Brax et.al., [2506.08786v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08786v1)

 Scalar dark matter is a viable alternative to particle dark matter models such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS). This is particularly the case for scalars with a low mass $m \gtrsim 10^{-21} {\rm eV}$ as required to make quantum effects macroscopic on galactic scales. We point out that by synchronising the measurements of arrival times of pairs of pulsars, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) could probe ultralight dark matter (ULDM) scenarios with a mass $10^{-23} {\rm eV}\lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-19} {\rm eV}$ that is greater than the one reached in standard analysis. The upper limit on the mass $m$ is set by the time lag $\Delta t$ between the observations of the two pulsars and could be pushed above $10^{-19} {\rm eV}$ for $\Delta t$ smaller than one hour.

2025-06-10, **Constraints on primordial black holes from interstellar dust temperature in the Galaxy**, A. N. Melikhov et.al., [2506.08605v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08605v1)

 The photons emitted by primordial black holes (PBHs) can be a heating factor for interstellar dust. Assuming that dust in the Galaxy has a homogeneous distribution and that PBHs have the same distribution as dark matter (DM), we constrain the fraction of PBHs in DM from the observational dust temperature in the Galaxy.

2025-06-10, **Euclid preparation: The NISP spectroscopy channel, on ground performance and calibration**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2506.08378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08378v1)

 ESA's Euclid cosmology mission relies on the very sensitive and accurately calibrated spectroscopy channel of the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). With three operational grisms in two wavelength intervals, NISP provides diffraction-limited slitless spectroscopy over a field of $0.57$ deg$^2$. A blue grism $\text{BG}\_\text{E}$ covers the wavelength range $926$--$1366$\,nm at a spectral resolution $R=440$--$900$ for a $0.5''$ diameter source with a dispersion of $1.24$ nm px$^{-1}$. Two red grisms $\text{RG}\_\text{E}$ span $1206$ to $1892$\,nm at $R=550$--$740$ and a dispersion of $1.37$ nm px$^{-1}$. We describe the construction of the grisms as well as the ground testing of the flight model of the NISP instrument where these properties were established.

2025-06-10, **Revealing Dark Matter's Role in Neutron Stars Anisotropy: A Bayesian Approach Using Multi-messenger Observations**, Xue-Zhi Liu et.al., [2506.08376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08376v1)

 Dark matter (DM) continues to evade direct detection, but neutron stars (NSs) serve as natural laboratories where even a modest DM component can alter their structure. While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely on specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and lack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear EOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and GW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\sim10\%$ remain consistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to reduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible pressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically significant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating that DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties. However, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our empirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core configurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span $\Delta R\_\chi \equiv R\_{\chi,\mathrm{max}} - R\_{\chi,\mathrm{min}}$ as a unified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously characterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear correlations ($\Delta R\_\chi < 4\,\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters, providing a clear avenue for future constraints. Our approach bridges current limitations and future potential in probing DM through compact star observations.

2025-06-09, **Dark Matter and CP Violation in Some Symmetry-Constrained 3HDMs**, Anton Kunčinas et.al., [2506.08197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08197v1)

 Multi-Higgs-doublet models can accommodate a dark matter candidate. An underlying symmetry not only ensures the candidate's stability but also helps control the number of free parameters. We consider two scenarios. First, we explore dark matter candidates in the $S\_3$-symmetric three-Higgs-doublet model. Notably, our findings reveal that the cases we discuss allow for different dark matter mass ranges compared to other candidates within three-Higgs-doublet models. Additionally, we investigate an alternative to conventional stabilisation via discrete symmetries by examining stabilisation through continuous symmetries. This alternative approach exhibits a unique characteristic-the emergence of mass-degenerate states. We also explore the impact of CP violation in the $S\_3$-symmetric three-Higgs-doublet model. Our analysis investigates how different representations of quarks under the $S\_3$ group, combined with various vacuum configurations, lead to distinct phenomenological consequences, including the possibility of very light neutral scalars.

2025-06-09, **Anisotropic quantum polytropes**, Hermano Velten et.al., [2506.08135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08135v1)

 The structure of astrophysical objects is usually modeled under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, actual configurations may deviate from perfect spherical or isotropic properties. Consequently, cosmic objects are expected to exhibit some degree of anisotropy. This consideration also extends to hypothetical dark structures, such as dark stars and dark matter halos. Although the nature of dark matter remains unknown, axion-like particles (ALPs) are strong candidates, suggesting that dark matter halos may have originated from bosonic configurations undergoing gravitational collapse, sustained by boson-boson interactions in the condensate state. This system is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation. Furthermore, within the framework of the Bohm-de Broglie approach, quantum effects,encapsulated in the so-called quantum potential, may play a significant role in equilibrium astrophysical configurations. In this study, we examine a class of static anisotropic boson stars which are non-minimally coupled to gravity. By including all these factors, we derive a generalized Lane-Emden-like equation and conduct a detailed analysis of the maximum degree of anisotropy that such systems can sustain, thereby identifying physically viable equilibrium configurations. Apart from focusing on the impact of anisotropic contributions, we find that for the so-called Quantum Polytropes (when the quantum potential is the main responsible for the equilibrium condition), the anisotropic factor and the gravitational field have opposite roles compared to the classical case. This leads to a new class of hydrostatic equilibrium objects.

2025-06-09, **The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST**, Pratika Dayal et.al., [2506.08116v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08116v1)

 James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of $z \sim 10.4$. These show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes in place by $z \sim 10$ and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios of $M\_{\rm BH}/M\_*\geq 0.1$. These pose a serious challenge for "astrophysical" seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with ``cosmological" primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses between $10^{0.5}-10^6 M\_\odot$. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass function that extends between $10^{1.25-11.25} ~(10^{0.75-7.25})M\_\odot$ at $z \sim 5 (15)$ for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly, PBH-seeded models (with spin $s=0$ or $-1$) naturally result in extremely high values of $M\_{\rm BH}/M\_*\geq 0.25$ at $z \sim 5-15$. For a typical stellar mass of $M\_* =10^9 M\_\odot$, we find an average value of $M\_{\rm BH}/M\_* \sim 0.4~ (1.6)$ for $s=0~(-1)$ at $z=5$, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are extremely metal poor ($Z \leq 10^{-2}~Z\_\odot$). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter fraction $\leq 10^{-9}$ and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current cosmological and astrophysical bounds.

2025-06-09, **Unraveling Freeze-in Dark matter through the echoes of gravitational waves**, Partha Konar et.al., [2506.08106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08106v1)

 In the quest to unravel the dark sector, feebly interacting freeze-in dark matter presents an intriguing possibility, plausibly explaining the consistent null results from various dark matter experiments. We propose a unique imprint in the form of gravitational waves generated during the freeze-in production of dark matter from heavy particle decay in the early universe. This characteristic gravitational wave signature can serve as a powerful probe for freeze-in dark matter. Our study indicates that future high-frequency gravitational wave experiments can detect these waves, offering a novel avenue to critically test the underlying conditions and requirements of this dark matter paradigm, which typically lie beyond the reach of current and planned dark matter detection experiments.

2025-06-09, **Large, fast and accurate HI intensity maps with latent overlap diffusion**, Satvik Mishra et.al., [2506.08086v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08086v1)

 The distribution of 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen is a powerful cosmological and astrophysical probe, as it traces the underlying dark matter and cold gas distributions throughout cosmic times. However, the prediction of observable signals is hindered by the large computational costs of the required hydrodynamic simulations. We introduce a novel machine learning pipeline that, once trained on a hydrodynamical simulation, is able to generate both halo mass density maps and the three-dimensional 21 cm brightness temperature signal, starting from a dark matter-only simulation. We use an attention-based ResUNet (HALO) to predict dark matter halo maps, which are then processed through a trained conditional variational diffusion model (LODI) to produce 21 cm brightness temperature maps. LODI is trained on smaller sub-volumes that are then seamlessly combined in 512-times larger volume using a new method, called `latent overlap'. We demonstrate that, once trained on 25^3 (Mpc/h)^3 volume simulations, we are able to predict the 21 cm power spectrum on an unseen dark matter map (with the same cosmology) to within 10% for wavenumbers k <= 10 h Mpc^-1, deep inside the non-linear regime, with a computational effort of the order of two minutes. While demonstrated on this specific volume, our approach is designed to be scalable to arbitrarily large simulations.

2025-06-09, **Kinetically Coupled Dark Matter Condensates**, Michael W. Toomey et.al., [2506.08076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08076v1)

 Dark matter consisting of ultralight bosons can form a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate with distinctive observational signatures. While this possibility has been extensively studied for axions and axion-like particles $-$ pseudoscalars with masses protected by shift symmetry $-$ realistic models from string theory and other higher-dimensional theories predict more complex structures. Here we investigate a two-field generalization where an axion couples to a moduli field through its kinetic term, representing the phase and radial modes of a complex scalar field. We demonstrate that when this system forms a gravitationally bound Bose-Einstein condensate, the kinetic coupling produces dramatic modifications to cosmological evolution compared to the canonical single-field case. Most notably, the axion Jeans scale becomes dynamically dependent on the moduli field's evolution, fundamentally altering structure formation. By mapping existing observational constraints from canonical axion models to our two-field scenario, we identify regions of parameter space that are already excluded by current observations. In particular, consistency with observations requires that the moduli field must take on small field values, $\chi/M\_{\rm pl} \ll 1$, throughout most of cosmic history for this class of axions to remain a viable description of all dark matter.

2025-06-09, **Not so dark, not so dense: an alternative explanation for the lensing subhalo in SDSSJ0946+1006**, Qiuhan He et.al., [2506.07978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07978v1)

 Previous studies of the strong lens system SDSSJ0946+1006 have reported a dark matter subhalo with an unusually high central density, potentially challenging the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. However, these analyses assumed the subhalo to be completely dark, neglecting the possibility that it may host a faint galaxy. In this work, we revisit the lensing analysis of SDSSJ0946+1006, explicitly modelling the subhalo as a luminous satellite. Incorporating light from the perturber broadens the range of allowed subhalo properties, revealing solutions with significantly lower central densities that are consistent with CDM expectations. The inferred luminosity of the satellite also aligns with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. While high-concentration subhaloes remain allowed, they are no longer statistically preferred. The luminous subhalo model yields a better fit to the data, while also offering a more plausible explanation that is in line with theoretical expectations. We validate our methodology using mock data, demonstrating that neglecting subhalo light can lead to inferred mass distributions that are artificially compact.

2025-06-09, **Torsion Balance Experiments Enable Direct Detection of Sub-eV Dark Matter**, Shigeki Matsumoto et.al., [2506.07763v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07763v1)

 Light dark matter with sub-eV masses has a high number density in our galaxy, and its scattering cross section with macroscopic objects can be significantly enhanced by coherence effects. Repeated scattering with a target object can induce a measurable acceleration. Torsion balance experiments with geometric asymmetry are, in principle, capable of detecting such signals. Our analysis shows that existing torsion balances designed to test the Equivalence Principle already place the most stringent constraints on DM-nucleon scattering in the $(10^{-2}, 1)\,$eV mass range.

2025-06-09, **Thermal corrections to dark matter annihilation with real photon emission/absorption**, Prabhat Butola et.al., [2506.07663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07663v1)

 The dark matter relic density is being increasingly precisely measured. This relic density is theoretically determined by a Boltzmann equation which computes the dark matter distribution according to the (thermally averaged) cross section for annihilation/production of dark matter within a given model. We present here the complete higher order thermal corrections, calculated using real time thermal field theory, to the cross section for the annihilation of dark matter into Standard Model fermions via charged scalars: $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f}$ and $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f} (\gamma)$. The latter process includes real photon emission into, and absorption from, the heat bath at temperature $T$. We use the Grammer and Yennie technique to separate the soft infra-red divergences, which greatly simplifies the calculation. We show explicitly the cancellation of both soft and collinear divergences between real and virtual contributions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the thermal field theory and remark on the non-trivial nature of the collinear divergences when the thermal contribution from fermions is considered. We present the leading thermal contributions to order ${\cal{O}}(\alpha T^2)$ for the case when the dark matter particle is a Majorana or Dirac type fermion. In the former case, both the leading order (LO) and NLO cross sections are helicity suppressed, while neither is suppressed in the Dirac case. It is interesting that the ratio of NLO to LO cross sections is the same for both Majorana and Dirac type dark matter.

2025-06-09, **Non-Separable Halo Bias from High-Redshift Galaxy Clustering**, Emy Mons et.al., [2506.07662v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07662v1)

 The halo model provides a powerful framework for interpreting galaxy clustering by linking the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes to the underlying matter distribution. A key assumption within the linear bias approximation of the halo model is that the halo bias between two halo populations is a separable function of the mass of each population. In this work, we test the validity of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear scales using both simulations and observational data. Unlike previous studies, we explicitly disentangle the effects of scale dependence of the bias to assess the robustness of bias separability across a broad range of halo masses and redshifts. In particular, we define a separability function based on halo or galaxy cross-correlations to quantify deviations from halo bias separability, and measure it from N-body simulations. We find significant departures from separability on quasi-linear scales ($\sim$ 1-5 Mpc) at high redshifts ($z \geq 3$), leading to enhancements in halo cross-correlations by up to a factor of 2 -- or even higher. In contrast, deviations at low redshifts remain modest. Additionally, using high-redshift ($z \sim 3.6$) galaxy samples, we detect deviations from bias separability that closely align with simulation predictions. The breakdown of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear scales at high redshifts underscore the importance to account for non-separability in models of the galaxy-halo connection in this regime. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of high-redshift galaxy cross-correlations as a probe for improving the galaxy-halo connection from upcoming large-scale surveys.

 This study examines the gravitational collapse of an overdense dark matter region in a coupled scalar field dark energy scenario within a flat FLRW background. It finds that, depending on the initial conditions, some overdense regions avoid collapse and expand eternally with the background. The interior overdense region follows a closed FLRW metric, while its boundary is described by generalized Vaidya spacetime, which allows flux across the boundary while preserving the homogeneity of dark energy inside. Dark matter evolves as cold dark matter, but in non-minimal coupling, the modified Klein-Gordon equation alters dark energy evolution. The results highlight the impact of coupled dark energy on dark matter virialization and cosmic structure formation.

2025-06-09, **Multi-band observation of lensed gravitational waves as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos**, Katsuya T. Abe et.al., [2506.07507v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07507v1)

 The gravitational lensing effect of gravitational waves (GWs) has been extensively discussed as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos, which can provide missing information about dark matter. We propose a multi-band observation of lensed GWs from a compact binary to observe both geometrical optics (GO) and wave optics (WO) effects from the same source. This method is expected to be advantageous in breaking parameter degeneracies between a GW source and a dark matter halo acting as a lens. We assume DECIGO or B-DECIGO as a space-based detector observing the early inspiral phase, and the ET as a ground-based detector observing the merger phase. We perform a Fisher analysis of multi-band detection for a source with masses $m\_1 = 30 M\_{\odot}, m\_2 = 20 M\_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.5$, and a lens with mass $3 \times 10^{3} M\_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.0$. With this setup, the GO effect appears in the ET frequency band, and the WO effect in that of DECIGO. For the halo density profile, we adopt Singular Isothermal Sphere, Cored Isothermal Sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White models. We find that multi-band observation resolves parameter degeneracies and significantly reduces errors in estimated parameters. For the CIS model, in particular, we show that, by combining ET and DECIGO observations, the lens mass error improves by about 71 $\%$ and 58 $\%$ compared to ET and DECIGO alone, respectively. Similarly, the impact parameter error is reduced by about 65 $\%$ and 70 $\%$, and the core size error by 34 $\%$ and 68 $\%$, respectively. From these results, we conclude that the multi-band observation of GWs from compact binaries improves the estimation of the lens object properties by breaking the parameter degeneracy.

2025-06-09, **Constraints on cosmology and baryonic feedback with joint analysis of Dark Energy Survey Year 3 lensing data and ACT DR6 thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations**, S. Pandey et.al., [2506.07432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07432v1)

 We present a joint analysis of weak gravitational lensing (shear) data obtained from the first three years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect measurements from a combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck data. A combined analysis of shear (which traces the projected mass) with the tSZ effect (which traces the projected gas pressure) can jointly probe both the distribution of matter and the thermodynamic state of the gas, accounting for the correlated effects of baryonic feedback on both observables. We detect the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation at a 21$\sigma$ significance, the highest to date, after minimizing the bias from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ map. By jointly modeling the small-scale shear auto-correlation and the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation, we obtain $S\_8 = 0.811^{+0.015}\_{-0.012}$ and $\Omega\_{\rm m} = 0.263^{+0.023}\_{-0.030}$, results consistent with primary CMB analyses from Planck and P-ACT. We find evidence for reduced thermal gas pressure in dark matter halos with masses $M < 10^{14} \, M\_{\odot}/h$, supporting predictions of enhanced feedback from active galactic nuclei on gas thermodynamics. A comparison of the inferred matter power suppression reveals a $2-4\sigma$ tension with hydrodynamical simulations that implement mild baryonic feedback, as our constraints prefer a stronger suppression. Finally, we investigate biases from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ-shear cross-correlation measurements, employing mitigation techniques to ensure a robust inference. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

2025-06-09, **Galaxy Cluster Mass Estimation Through The Splashback Radius**, Lucas Gabriel-Silva et.al., [2506.07425v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07425v1)

 We present an analysis of the splashback radius ($R\_{\text{sp}}$) and the associated splashback mass ($M\_{\text{sp}}$) for a sample of galaxy clusters using SDSS spectroscopic data and mock simulations. $R\_{\text{sp}}$ marks a physical boundary between the virialized core and the outer infall regions of clusters, providing a robust measure of cluster mass accretion history without being affected by pseudo-evolution. We model the cumulative galaxy number profile of clusters, testing different halo density models and considering the impact of cluster properties, such as center definitions, magnitude limits, galaxy colors, and field contamination, on the estimation of splashback features. Our results show that observed splashback radii, measured in projection (2D), are consistently smaller than predicted by dark matter simulations, with $R\_\text{sp}/R\_{200m} \approx 1$, supporting previous discrepancies in the literature. We also explore the relationship between $M\_{\text{sp}}$ and $R\_{\text{sp}}$, proposing a new scaling relation for future cosmological studies, as $R\_{\text{sp}}$ is easily observable. Our findings indicate that splashback masses strongly correlate with radii, with a dispersion of $\approx 0.15$ dex, competitive with other mass-observable relations. However, the fitted relation diverges from the constant density expectations of galaxy clusters around $R\_\text{sp}$. Additionally, the $M\_{\text{sp}} \textendash R\_{\text{sp}}$ relation shows significant redshift evolution, though the predominantly low-redshift range of our sample limits our ability to confirm this trend conclusively. The approach developed here may play a key role in cluster characterization and cosmology in the era of large galaxy surveys.

 It is assumed that superheavy dark matter particles (SHDM, $\phi$) with $\mathcal{O}$(ZeV) mass may decay to relativistic milli-charged particles (MCPs, $\chi$) via a channel $\phi\to\chi\bar{\chi}$ or $\gamma\chi\bar{\chi}$. The downward-going MCPs passing through the atmosphere can be measured by the Pierre Auger observatory (Auger). The massless hidden photon model is taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei, so that we evaluated the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs at Auger assuming 14 years of Auger data. The hybrid data of Auger was fitted with the flux of UHE MCPs exceeding GZK-cutoff energy. Then the corresponding upper limits on $\epsilon^2$ are calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicate that MCPs can be directly detected with $\epsilon^2\gtrsim 2\times10^{-6}$ at Auger, when $m\_{\phi}=2\times10^{21}$ eV and $\tau\_{\phi}=10^{27}$ s. And a new region of 10$^{9.6}$ < $m\_{MCP}$ < 10$^{11.6}$ eV and $\epsilon$ > $2.12\times10^{-2}$ is ruled out in the $m\_{MCP}$-$\epsilon$ plane with 14 years of Auger data. These results indicate potential existence of MCPs and SHDM in the Universe.

 In this paper, we calibrate the luminosity relation of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) which is employed to analyze the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in a manner independent of cosmological assumptions. The A219 GRB dataset are used to calibrate the Amati relation (\(E\_{\rm p}\)-\(E\_{\rm iso}\)) at low redshift with the ANN framework, facilitating the construction of the Hubble diagram at higher redshifts. Cosmological models are constrained with GRBs at high-redshift and the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical approach. For the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model within a flat universe, we obtain \(\Omega\_{\rm m} = 0.321^{+0.078}\_{-0.069}\), \(h = 0.654^{+0.053}\_{-0.071}\), \(w\_0 = -1.02^{+0.67}\_{-0.50}\), and \(w\_a = -0.98^{+0.58}\_{-0.58}\) at the 1-\(\sigma\) confidence level, which indicating a preference for dark energy with potential redshift evolution (\(w\_a \neq 0\)). These findings by using ANN align closely with those derived from GRBs calibrated by using Gaussian Processes.

 We extend the study of the search for ALP-photon emissions from a Supernovae (SNe) progenitor, the Red Supergiant Star (RGS), as Betelgeuse, arising through a combination of Bremsstrahlung, Compton, and Primako? processes, in the hard-X and MeV energy range, using the next proposed and future experiments, such as COMCUBE, GECCO, COSI, AMEGO-X, and e-ASTROGAM.

2025-06-10, **Observatory Science with eXTP**, Ping Zhou et.al., [2506.08367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08367v1)

 Scheduled for launch in 2030, the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization (eXTP) telescope is a Chinese space-based mission aimed at studying extreme conditions and phenomena in astrophysics. eXTP will feature three main payloads: Spectroscopy Focusing Arrays (SFAs), Polarimetry Focusing Arrays (PFAs), and a Wide-field Camera (W2C). This white paper outlines observatory science, incorporating key scientific advances and instrumental changes since the publication of the previous white paper [1]. We will discuss perspectives of eXTP on the research domains of flare stars, supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, AGN, and pulsar-based positioning and timekeeping.

2025-06-09, **An environmental analysis of supernova iPTF13bvn with HST and MUSE**, Adam J. Singleton et.al., [2506.08099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08099v1)

 Searches for supernovae (SNe) progenitors have relied on a direct detection of the star in fortuitous pre-explosion images. We propose an alternative method, using a combination of photometric stellar population fitting alongside integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopic analysis of the ionised gas to fully explore the SN environment and constrain the progenitor properties. Isochrone fitting of HST/WFC3 observations reveals the environment of iPTF13bvn contains two stellar populations with unique age ($\tau=\log{t [years]}$) and extinction ($A\_V$) values, with the closest agreement found between past progenitor studies of iPTF13bvn and our oldest stellar population (P2): $\tau\_{P2}=6.97^{+0.06}\_{-0.06}$, a corresponding initial mass $M\_{initial,P2} = 20.0 M\_\odot$ and $A\_{V,P2}=0.53^{+0.10}\_{-0.08}$ mag. Further analysis with VLT/MUSE IFU-spectroscopic observations reveals no bright H II regions associated with iPTF13bvn, suggesting no immediate ongoing star formation. Extinctions derived from the ionised gas are a minimum of ~2.5 times higher than the resolved stellar population values, assisting in building a 3D picture of the environment. An analysis of the distribution of spaxel extinctions reveals increased variability in the environment of iPTF13bvn, on the edge of a spiral arm. Our study highlights the complex relationship between stars, gas and dust and how, when used in a holistic environmental analysis, they can begin to resolve degeneracies that have plagued past progenitor investigations. Specifically for iPTF13bvn, our results support a binary progenitor and a growing consensus for binarity as the predominant mass-loss mechanism for Type Ib SNe progenitors.

2025-06-09, **Spectroscopic and kinematic analyses of a warm survivor of a D6 supernova**, Mark A. Hollands et.al., [2506.08081v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08081v1)

 SDSSJ163712.21+363155.9 is a candidate hyper-runaway star, first identified from its unusual spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which exhibits oxygen, magnesium, and silicon lines redshifted by several $100\,$km/s, leading to the suggestion it was ejected from a thermonuclear supernova. We have acquired GTC OSIRIS spectroscopy of SDSSJ1637+3631 establishing a warm ($T\_\mathrm{eff}=15680\pm250\,$K) carbon+oxygen dominated atmosphere, that is also abundant in the intermediate mass elements silicon, sulphur, and calcium. We interpret SDSSJ1637+3631 as the donor to an accreting white dwarf that exploded in a dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) type Ia supernova, where the current composition is consistent with a CO white dwarf core, enriched with intermediate mass elements from deposited supernova ejecta. While SDSSJ1637+3631 has a low-precision Gaia parallax, our spectroscopic surface gravity ($\log g=6.3\pm0.3\,$dex) helps constrain its tangential velocity to $1950^{+810}\_{-530}\,$km/s, providing additional support to the D6 mechanism. Under the assumption that SDSSJ1637+3631 is a D6 survivor, we construct a kinematic model combining all astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric information, but also including the structure and gravitational potential of the Milky Way. Our model localises the ejection site to the inner few kpc of the Galactic disc (though excluding the Galactic centre), with an ejection speed of $1870^{+360}\_{-300}\,$km/s, and a $4.5^{+0.4}\_{-0.5}\,$Myr time of flight.

2025-06-09, **Fundamental Parameters for Central Stars of 103 Infrared Bowshock Nebulae**, Nikhil Patten et.al., [2506.07904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07904v1)

 Stellar bowshock nebulae are arcuate shock fronts formed by the interaction of radiation-driven stellar winds and the relative motion of the ambient interstellar material. Stellar bowshock nebulae provide a promising means to measure wind-driven mass loss, independent of other established methods. In this work, we characterize the stellar sources at the center of bowshock nebulae drawn from all-sky catalogs of 24 $\mu$m-selected nebulae. We obtain new, low-resolution blue optical spectra for \numstars~stars and measure stellar parameters temperature \teff, surface gravity \logg, and projected rotational broadening \vsini. We perform additional photometric analysis to measure stellar radius \rstar, luminosity \lstar, and visual-band extinction $A\_V$. All but one of our targets are O and early B stars, with temperatures ranging from $T$=16.5--46.8~k\kelvin, gravities $\log g=$2.57--4.60, and \vsini~from $<$100--400~\kms. With the exception of rapid rotator $\zeta$ Oph, bowshock stars do not rotate at or near critical velocities. At least 60 of 103 (60\%) OB bowshock stars are binaries, consistent with the multiplicity fraction of other OB samples. The sample shows a runaway fraction of 23\%, with \numrunaway~stars having $v\_{\text{2D}}\geq25$~\kms. Of the 19 runaways, at least 15 ($\geq$79\%) are binaries, favoring dynamical ejection over the binary supernova channel for producing runaways. We provide a comprehensive census of stellar parameters for bowshock stars, useful as a foundation for determining the mass-loss rates for OB-type stars -- one of the single most critical factors in stellar evolution governing the production of neutron stars and black holes.

2025-06-09, **Mitigating Polarization Leakage in Gas Pixel Detectors through Hybrid Machine Learning and Analytic Event Reconstruction**, Nicoló Cibrario et.al., [2506.07828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07828v1)

 Spatially resolved polarization measurements of extended X-ray sources are expanding our understanding of the emission mechanisms and magnetic field properties involved. Such measurements have been possible in the past few years thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). However, the analysis of extended sources suffers a systematic effect known as polarization leakage, which artificially affects the measured polarization signal. To address this issue, we built a hybrid reconstruction algorithm, which combines machine learning and analytic techniques to improve the reconstruction of photoelectron tracks in the Gas Pixel Detector and to significantly mitigate polarization leakage. This work presents the first application of this hybrid method to experimental data, including both calibration lab measurements and IXPE observational data. We confirmed the reliable performance of the hybrid method for both cases. Additionally, we demonstrated the algorithm's effectiveness in reducing the polarization leakage effect through the analysis of the IXPE observation of the supernova remnant G21.5-0.9. By enabling more reliable polarization measurements, this method can potentially yield deeper insights into the magnetic field structures, particle acceleration processes, and emission mechanisms at work within extended X-ray sources.

2025-06-09, **$f(R, G, T)$ Gravity: Cosmological Implications and Dynamical System Analysis**, Ratul Mandal et.al., [2506.07623v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07623v2)

 We consider the cosmological implications of a four-dimensional extension of the Gauss-Bonnet f(G) gravity, where $G$ is the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant, in which the Einstein-Hilbert action is replaced by an arbitrary function $f(R,G,T)$ of G, of the Ricci scalar $R$, and of the trace $T$ of the matter energy-momentum tensor. By construction, the extended Gauss-Bonnet type action involves a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry. The field equations of the model are obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric. The generalized Friedmann equations, describing the cosmological evolution in the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry, are also presented in their general form. We investigate the cosmological evolution of the Universe in the generalized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theiry for a specific choice of the Lagrangian density, as given by $f(R, G, T) = \alpha\_1 G + \alpha\_2 R^{\beta} - 2\alpha\_3 \sqrt{-T}$, where $\alpha\_i$ (for $i = 1, 2, 3$) are model parameters. First, the theoretical predictions of the model are compared with a set of observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type IA Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) via an MCMC analysis, which allows us to obtain constraints on the model parameters. A comparison with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM system is also performed. Next, the generalized Friedmann equations are reformulated as a dynamical system, and the properties of its critical points are studied by using the Lyapunov linear stability analysis. This investigation allows for the reconstruction of the Universe's history in this model, from the early inflationary era to the late accelerating phase. The statefinder diagnostic parameters for the model are also considered from the dynamical system perspective.
