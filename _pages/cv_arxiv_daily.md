2023-06-27, **Electromagnetic Cascade Emission from Neutrino-Coincident Tidal Disruption Events**, Chengchao Yuan et.al., [2306.15659v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15659v1)

 The potential association between Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and high-energy astrophysical neutrinos implies the acceleration of cosmic rays. These accelerated particles will initiate electromagnetic (EM) cascades spanning from keV to GeV energies by the processes related to neutrino production. We model the EM cascade and neutrino emissions by numerically solving the time-dependent transport equations and discuss the implications for AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr in the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands. We show that the $\gamma$-ray constraints from \emph{Fermi} can constrain the size of the radiation zone and the maximum energy of injected protons, and that the corresponding expected neutrino event numbers in follow-up searches are limited to be less than about 0.1. Depending on the efficiency of $p\gamma$ interactions, the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray signals can be expected closer to the peak of the optical-ultraviolet (OUV) luminosity, or to the time of the neutrino production.

2023-06-27, **Exploring mixed lepton-quark interactions in non-resonant leptoquark production at the LHC**, João Gonçalves et.al., [2306.15460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15460v1)

 Searches for new physics (NP) at particle colliders typically involve multivariate analysis of kinematic distributions of final state particles produced in a decay of a hypothetical NP resonance. Since the pair-production cross-sections mediated by such resonances are strongly suppressed by the NP scale, this analysis becomes less relevant for NP searches for masses of the BSM resonance above 1 TeV. On the other hand, $t$-channel processes are less sensitive to the mass of the virtual mediator and therefore larger phase-space can be potentially probed as well as the couplings between the NP particles and the Standard Model fields. The fact that transitions between different generations of quarks and leptons may exist, the potential of the search presented in this article can be used, as a reference guide, to enlarge significantly the scope of searches performed at the LHC to flavour off-diagonal channels, in a theoretically consistent approach. In this work, we study non-resonant production of scalar leptoquarks which have been proposed in the literature to provide a potential avenue for radiative generation of neutrino masses, accommodating as well the existing flavour physics data. Final states involving just two muons at the LHC ($\mu^+, \mu^-$), are used as a well-motivated case study.

2023-06-27, **Prediction of non-SUSY AdS conjecture on the lightest neutrino mass revisited**, Cao H. Nam et.al., [2306.15383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15383v1)

 We study the constraint of the non-SUSY AdS conjecture on the three-dimensional vacua obtained from the compactification of the Standard Model coupled to Einstein gravity on a circle where the three-dimensional components of the four-dimensional metric are general functions of both non-compact and compact coordinates. We find from studying the wavefunction profile of the three-dimensional metric in the compactified dimension that the radius of the compactified dimension must be quantized. Consequently, the three-dimensional vacua are constrained by not only the non-SUSY AdS conjecture but also the quantization rule of the circle radius, leading to both upper and lower bounds for the mass of the lightest neutrino as $\sqrt{2}\leq m\_\nu/\sqrt{\Lambda\_4}<\sqrt{3}$ where $\Lambda\_4\simeq5.06\times10^{-84}$ GeV$^2$ is the observed cosmological constant. This means that the lightest neutrino should have a mass around $10^{-32}$ eV or it would be well-approximately massless. With this prediction, we reconstruct the light neutrino mass matrix that is fixed by the neutrino oscillation data and in terms of three new mixing angles and six new phases for both the normal ordering and inverted ordering. In the situation that the light neutrino mass matrix is Hermitian, we calculate its numerical value in the $3\sigma$ range.

2023-06-27, **Radiative neutrino masses and the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound**, Patrick Adolf et.al., [2306.15313v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15313v1)

 Recently, an increasing interest in UV/IR mixing phenomena has drawn attention to the range of validity of standard quantum field theory. Here we explore the consequences of such a limited range of validity in the context of radiative models for neutrino mass generation. We adopt an argument first published by Cohen, Kaplan and Nelson that gravity implies both UV and IR cutoffs, apply it to the loop integrals describing radiative corrections, and demonstrate that this effect has significant consequences for the parameter space of radiative neutrino mass models.

2023-06-27, **Atmospheric Lepton Fluxes via Two-Dimensional Matrix Cascade Equations**, Tetiana Kozynets et.al., [2306.15263v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15263v1)

 The atmospheric lepton fluxes play a crucial role in many particle and astroparticle physics experiments, e.g. in establishing the neutrino signal and the muon background for neutrino oscillation measurements, or the atmospheric background for astrophysical neutrino searches. The Matrix Cascade Equations (MCEq) code is a numerical tool used to model the atmospheric lepton fluxes by solving a system of coupled differential equations for particle production, interaction, and decay at extremely low computational costs. Previously, the MCEq framework only accommodated longitudinal development of air showers, an approximation that works well for neutrino and muon fluxes at high energies (O(10 GeV) and above). However, for accurate calculations of atmospheric lepton angular distributions at lower energies, the lateral component of hadronic cascades becomes significant, necessitating three-dimensional calculation schemes. We introduce "2D MCEq", an efficient numerical approach for combined longitudinal and angular evolution of air showers that retains the low computational complexity. The accuracy of the "2D MCEq" is affirmed by its benchmark comparison with the standard Monte Carlo code CORSIKA. This study paves the way for efficient three-dimensional calculations of atmospheric neutrino fluxes.

2023-06-27, **Baryogenesis via flavoured leptogenesis in a minimal type-II seesaw model**, Sreerupa Chongdar et.al., [2306.15229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15229v1)

 We study baryogenesis via leptogenesis in an extension of the Standard Model by adding one right-handed neutrino and one triplet scalar. These heavy particles contribute to the generation of tiny neutrino mass through seesaw mechanism. The contribution of the heavy particles to the neutrino masses is inversely proportional to their corresponding masses. Considering leptogenesis is achieved by the decay of the right-handed neutrino, the new source of CP asymmetry comes solely from the decay of the right-handed neutrino with one-loop vertex diagram involving the triplet scalar. The predictiveness of the model is enhanced by introducing Fritzsch-type textures for the neutrino mass matrix and charged lepton mass matrix. We execute the parameter space study following the latest neutrino oscillation data. We study baryogenesis via leptogenesis in the two-flavoured regime, using the zero textures, and show that there is an enhancement in baryon asymmetry as compared to the unflavoured regime. For two-flavour leptogenesis we consider the suitable temperature regime $T\subset\left[10^{10},10^{11}\right]$ GeV. We also study the common correlation of CP violation between low and high-energy regimes using the geometrical description of CP violation in terms of unitarity triangle.

2023-06-26, **On the dark radiation role in the Hubble constant tension**, Stefano Gariazzo et.al., [2306.15067v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15067v1)

 Dark radiation, parameterized in terms of $N\_{\rm eff}$, has been considered many times in the literature as a possible remedy in alleviating the Hubble constant ($H\_0$) tension. We review here the effect of such an extra dark radiation component in the different cosmological observables, focusing mostly on $H\_0$. While a larger value of $N\_{\rm eff}$ automatically implies a larger value of the Hubble constant, and one would naively expect that such a simple scenario provides a decent solution, more elaborated models are required. Light sterile neutrinos or neutrino asymmetries are among the first-order corrections to the most economical (tree-level) massless dark radiation scenario. However, they are not fully satisfactory in solving the $H\_0$ issue. We devote here special attention to second-order corrections: some interacting scenarios, such as those with new dark radiation degrees of freedom that exhibit a non-free streaming nature are highly satisfactory alternative cosmologies where to solve the Hubble constant tension. Models with self-interacting sterile neutrinos and/or majorons, both well-motivated beyond the Standard Model particles, will be discussed along our assessment.

2023-06-26, **Thermodynamics of oscillating neutrinos**, Lucas Johns et.al., [2306.14982v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14982v1)

 The title theory is formulated. It entails a quantum-coherent variant of the Fermi-Dirac distribution and casts new light on neutrino oscillations. It might enable the incorporation of neutrino mixing into the modeling of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers.

2023-06-26, **Spontaneous CP violation and $μ-τ$ symmetry in two-Higgs-doublet models with flavour conservation**, João M. Alves et.al., [2306.14952v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14952v1)

 In multi-Higgs-doublet models, requiring simultaneously that (i) CP violation only arises spontaneously, (ii) tree level scalar flavour changing couplings are absent and (iii) the fermion mixing matrix is CP violating, can only be achieved in a very specific manner. A general approach with new clarifying insights on the question is presented. Considering the quark sector, that peculiar possibility is not viable on phenomenological grounds. We show that, considering the lepton sector, it is highly interesting and leads to viable models with $\mu-\tau$ symmetric PMNS matrices. Phenomenological implications of the models, both for Dirac and Majorana (in a type I seesaw scenario) neutrinos, are analysed.

2023-06-26, **Hourslong Near-UV/Optical Emission from Mildly Relativistic Outflows in Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers**, Ore Gottlieb et.al., [2306.14946v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14946v1)

 The ongoing LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run O4 provides an opportunity to discover new multi-messenger events, including binary neutron star (BNS) mergers such as GW170817, and the highly anticipated first detection of a multi-messenger black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) merger. While BNS mergers were predicted to exhibit early optical emission from mildly-relativistic outflows, it has remained uncertain whether the BH-NS merger ejecta provides the conditions for similar signals to emerge. We present the first modeling of early near-ultraviolet/optical emission from mildly-relativistic outflows in BH-NS mergers. Adopting optimal binary properties, mass ratio of $q=2$ and rapidly rotating BH, we utilize numerical-relativity and general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to follow the binary's evolution from the pre-merger to homologous expansion. We use an M1 neutrino transport GRMHD simulation to self-consistently estimate the opacity distribution in the outflows, and find a bright near-ultraviolet/optical signal that emerges due to jet-powered cocoon cooling emission, outshining the kilonova emission at early time. The signal peaks at an absolute magnitude of $-14$ to $-15$ a few hours after the merger, longer than previous estimates, which did not consider the first-principles-based jet launching. By late 2024, the Rubin Observatory will have the capability to track the entire signal evolution, or detect its peak up to distances $\gtrsim1$ Gpc. In 2026, ULTRASAT will conduct all-sky surveys within minutes, detecting some of these events within $ \sim 200 $ Mpc. BH-NS mergers with higher mass ratios or lower BH spins would produce shorter and fainter signals.

2023-06-26, **Neutrino magnetic moment and XENON1T excess, inert doublet dark matter in a Type-III radiative scenario**, Shivaramakrishna Singirala et.al., [2306.14801v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14801v1)

 We narrate dark matter, neutrino magnetic moment and mass in a Type-III radiative scenario. The Standard Model is enriched with three vector-like fermion triplets and two inert doublets to provide a suitable platform for the above phenomenological aspects. The inert scalars contribute to total relic density of dark matter in the Universe. Neutrino aspects are realized at one-loop with magnetic moment obtained through charged scalars, while neutrino mass gets contribution from charged and neutral scalars. Taking inert scalars up to $2$ TeV and triplet fermion in few hundred TeV range, we obtain a common parameter space, compatible with experimental limits associated with both neutrino and dark matter sectors. Using a specific region for transition magnetic moment (${\cal O} (10^{-11}\mu\_B$)), we explain the excess recoil events, reported by the XENON1T collaboration.

2023-06-26, **Constraints on quantum spacetime-induced decoherence from neutrino oscillations**, Vittorio D'Esposito et.al., [2306.14778v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14778v1)

 We investigate the implications of decoherence induced by quantum spacetime properties on neutrino oscillation phenomena. We develop a general formalism where the evolution of neutrinos is governed by a Lindblad-type equation and we compute the oscillation damping factor for various models that have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity to these effects of different types of neutrino oscillation experiments, encompassing astrophysical, atmospheric, solar, and reactor neutrino experiments. By using neutrino oscillation data from long-baseline reactors and atmospheric neutrino observations, we establish stringent constraints on the energy scale governing the strength of the decoherence induced by stochastic metric fluctuations, amounting to, respectively, $E\_{QG}\geq 4.1 \cdot 10^{24}\; \text{GeV}$ and $E\_{QG}\geq 4.2\cdot 10^{34}\;\text{GeV}$.

2023-06-26, **Low and High Energy Neutrinos from SN 2023ixf in M101**, Dafne Guetta et.al., [2306.14717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14717v1)

 Supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101 is the closest SN explosion observed in the last decade. Therefore it is a suitable test bed to study the role of jets in powering the SN ejecta. With this aim, we explored the idea that high-energy neutrinos could be produced during the interaction between the jets and the intense radiation field produced in the SN explosion and eventually be observed by the IceCube neutrino telescope. The lack of detection of such neutrinos has significantly constrained both the fraction of stellar collapses that produce jets and/or the theoretical models for neutrino production. Finally, we investigated the possibility of detecting low-energy neutrinos from SN 2023ixf with the Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande experiments, obtaining in both cases sub-threshold estimates.

2023-06-26, **Recasting Bounds on Long-lived Heavy Neutral Leptons in Terms of a Light Supersymmetric R-parity Violating Neutralino**, Herbi K. Dreiner et.al., [2306.14700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14700v1)

 In R-parity-violating (RPV) supersymmetric models, light neutralinos with masses from the GeV-scale down to even zero are still allowed by all laboratory constraints. They are further consistent with dark matter observations, as they decay via RPV couplings. These RPV couplings are in general constrained to be small. Hence, such light neutralinos, if produced, e.g., at a beam-dump or collider experiment, appear as displaced vertices or missing energy at the detector level. The same signatures have been extensively searched for at various experiments in the theoretical context of sterile neutrinos which mix with active neutrinos. In this work, we recast the sensitivity of both past and present experiments to sterile neutrinos to obtain new bounds on RPV couplings associated with a light neutralino. We find experiments such as T2K, BEBC, FASER, DUNE, and MoEDAL-MAPP can improve the current bounds on RPV couplings by up to $3-4$ orders of magnitude in several benchmark scenarios.

2023-06-26, **Neutrino oscillation bounds on quantum decoherence**, Valentina De Romeri et.al., [2306.14699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14699v1)

 We consider quantum-decoherence effects in neutrino oscillation data. Working in the open quantum system framework we adopt a phenomenological approach that allows to parameterize the energy dependence of the decoherence effects. We consider several phenomenological models. We analyze data from the reactor experiments RENO, Daya Bay and KamLAND and from the accelerator experiments NOvA, MINOS/MINOS+ and T2K. We obtain updated constraints on the decoherence parameters quantifying the strength of damping effects, which can be as low as $\Gamma\_{ij} \lesssim 8 \times 10^{-27}$ GeV at 90% confidence level in some cases. We also present sensitivities for the future facilities DUNE and JUNO.

2023-06-26, **Measurement of the 2$νββ$ Decay Half-Life of Se-82 with the Global CUPID-0 Background Model**, O. Azzolini et.al., [2306.14654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14654v1)

 We report on the results obtained with the global CUPID-0 background model, which combines the data collected in the two measurement campaigns for a total exposure of 16.6 kg$\times$yr. We identify with improved precision the background sources in the region of interest for neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay, making more solid the foundations for the background budget of the next-generation CUPID experiment. Relying on the excellent data reconstruction, we measure the two-neutrino double $\beta$-decay half-life of $^{82}$Se with unprecedented accuracy: $T\_{1/2}^{2\nu} = [8.69 \pm 0.05 \textrm{(stat.)}~^{+0.09}\_{-0.06} \textrm{(syst.)}] \times 10^{19}~\textrm{yr}$.

2023-06-26, **Hill-top inflation from Dai-Freed anomaly in the standard model -- A solution to the iso-curvature problem of the axion dark matter**, Masahiro Kawasaki et.al., [2306.14579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14579v1)

 The discrete symmetry $Z\_4$ in the standard model (SM) with three right-handed neutrinos is free from the Dai-Freed anomaly. Motivated by this $Z\_4$ symmetry, we constructed a topological inflation model consistent with all known constraints and observations. However, we assumed a specific inflaton potential in the previous work. In this paper we extend the inflaton potential in a more general form allowed by the discrete $Z\_4$ gauge symmetry and show that consistent hilltop inflation is realized. We find that the Hubble parameter $H\_\mathrm{inf}$ can be smaller than $\simeq 10^{9}$ GeV so that the isocurvature fluctuations of the axion dark matter are sufficiently suppressed. Furthermore, the running of the spectral index can be as large as $dn\_s/\ln k \simeq 0.0018$ which will be tested in future CMB observations. Since this discrete $Z\_4$ acts on the SM, the inflaton can couple to pairs of the right-handed neutrinos and hence the reheating temperature can be high as $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV, producing the cosmic baryon asymmetry naturally through the thermal leptogenesis.

2023-06-26, **Simple Modular invariant model for Quark, Lepton, and flavored-QCD axion**, Y. H. Ahn et.al., [2306.14467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14467v1)

 We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model by incorporating sterile neutrinos and a QCD axion to account for the mass and mixing hierarchies of quarks and leptons and to solve the strong CP problem, and by introducing $G\_{\rm SM}\times \Gamma\_N\times U(1)\_X$ symmetry. We demonstrate that the K{\"a}hler transformation corrects the weight of modular forms in the superpotential and show that the model is consistent with the modular and $U(1)\_X$ anomaly-free conditions. This enables a simple construction of a modular-independent superpotential for scalar potential. Using minimal supermultiplets, we demonstrate a level 3 modular form-induced superpotential. Sterile neutrinos explain small active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and provide a well-motivated $U(1)\_X$ breaking scale, whereas gauge singlet scalar fields play crucial roles in generating the QCD axion, heavy neutrino mass, and fermion mass hierarchy. The model predicts a range for the $U(1)\_X$ breaking scale from $10^{13}$ GeV to $10^{15}$ GeV for $1\,\mbox{TeV}< m\_{3/2}<10^6\,\mbox{TeV}$. In the supersymmetric limit, all Yukawa coefficients in the superpotential are given by complex numbers with an absolute value of unity, implying a democratic distribution. Performing numerical analysis, we study how model parameters are constrained by current experimental results. In particular, the model predicts that the value of the quark Dirac CP phase falls between $38^\circ$ to $87^\circ$, which is consistent with experimental data, and the favored value of the neutrino Dirac CP phase is around $250^\circ$. Furthermore, the model can be tested by ongoing and future experiments on axion searches, neutrino oscillations, and $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay.

2023-06-26, **General solutions for TM$_{1,2}$ mixing in the minimal type-I seesaw mechanism and phenomenological constraints to Yukawa matrix of neutrinos**, Masaki J. S. Yang et.al., [2306.14383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14383v1)

 In this paper, we concisely represent the general solution for the TM$\_{1,2}$ mixing in the type-I minimal seesaw mechanism and show phenomenological constraints of the Yukawa matrix of neutrinos $Y$. First, conditions of $Z\_{2}$ symmetry associated with TM$\_{1,2}$ restrict two complex parameters. In addition, three complex parameters are constrained from five phenomenological parameters (two neutrino masses $m\_{i}$, the mixing angle $\theta\_{13}$, the Dirac phase $\delta$, and the Majorana phase $\alpha$) and the overall phase. As a result, there is only one free complex parameter for $Y$, except for the right-handed neutrino masses $M\_{1,2}$.   For the TM$\_{1}$ mixing with normal hierarchy, the symmetry condition is imposed only on $Y$, and the physical parameters depend on $M\_{R}$. In other situations, the dimensionless parameters $(\theta\_{13}, \delta$ and $\alpha)$ do not depend on $M\_{R}$ but only on certain combinations of the components of $Y$.

2023-06-27, **Bubbletrons**, Iason Baldes et.al., [2306.15555v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15555v1)

 In cosmological first-order phase transitions (PT) with relativistic bubble walls, high-energy shells of particles generically form on the inner and outer sides of the walls. Shells from different bubbles can then collide with energies much larger than the PT or inflation scales, and with sizeable rates, realising a `bubbletron'. As an application, we calculate the maximal dark matter mass $M\_{DM}$ that can be produced from shell collisions in a U(1) gauge PT, for scales of the PT $v\_\varphi$ from MeV to $10^{16}$ GeV. We find for example $M\_{DM} \sim 10^6/10^{11}/10^{15}$ GeV for $v\_\varphi \sim 10^{-2}/10^3/10^8$ GeV. The gravity wave signal sourced at the PT then links Pulsar Timing Arrays with the PeV scale, LISA with the ZeV one, and the Einstein Telescope with grand unification.

2023-06-26, **Supernovae and superbursts by dark matter clumps**, Nirmal Raj et.al., [2306.14981v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14981v1)

 Cosmologies in which dark matter clumps strongly on small scales are unfavorable to terrestrial detectors that are as yet unexposed to the clumps. I show that sub-hectometer clumps could trigger thermonuclear runaways by scattering on nuclei in white dwarf cores (carbon and oxygen) and neutron star oceans (carbon), setting off Type Ia-like supernovae and x-ray superbursts respectively. I consider two scenarios: ``dark clusters" that are essentially microhalos, and ``long-range dark nuggets", essentially macroscopic composites, with long-range Yukawa baryonic interactions that source the energy for igniting explosions. I constrain dark clusters weighing between the Planck mass and asteroid masses, and long-range dark nuggets over a wider mass range spanning forty orders of magnitude. These limits greatly complement searches I had co-proposed in 2109.04582 for scattering interactions of dark clumps in neutron stars, cosmic rays, and pre-historic minerals.

2023-06-26, **Probing astrophysical environment with eccentric extreme mass-ratio inspirals**, Mostafizur Rahman et.al., [2306.14971v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14971v1)

 The discovery of gravitational waves and black holes has started a new era of gravitational wave astronomy that allows us to probe the underpinning features of gravity and astrophysics in extreme environments of the universe. In this article, we investigate one such study with an extreme mass-ratio inspiral system where the primary object is a spherically symmetric static black hole immersed in a dark matter halo governed by the Hernquist density distribution. We consider the eccentric equatorial orbital motion of the steller-mass object orbiting around the primary and compute measurable effects. We examine the behaviour of dark matter mass and halo radius in generated gravitational wave fluxes and the evolution of eccentric orbital parameters -- eccentricity and semi-latus rectum. We further provide an estimate of gravitational wave dephasing and find the seminal role of low-frequency detectors in the observational prospects of such an astrophysical environment.

2023-06-26, **Simulations of Gravitational Heating Due to Early Matter Domination**, Himanish Ganjoo et.al., [2306.14961v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14961v1)

 In cosmologies with an early matter-dominated era (EMDE) prior to Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the boosted growth of small-scale matter perturbations during the EMDE leads to microhalo formation long before halos would otherwise begin to form. For a range of models, halos can even form during the EMDE itself. These halos would dissipate at the end of the EMDE, releasing their gravitationally heated dark matter and thereby imprinting a free-streaming cut-off on the matter power spectrum. We conduct the first cosmological $N$-body simulations of the formation and evaporation of halos during and after an EMDE. We show that in these scenarios, the free-streaming cut-off after the EMDE can be predicted accurately from the linear matter power spectrum. Although the free streaming can erase much of the EMDE-driven boost to density perturbations, we use our findings to show that the (re-)formation of halos after the EMDE nevertheless proceeds before redshift $\sim 1000$. Early-forming microhalos are a key observational signature of an EMDE, and our prescription for the impact of gravitational heating will allow studies of the observational status and prospects of EMDE scenarios to cover a much wider range of parameters.

2023-06-26, **A Purely Gravitational Origin for Einstein-Proca Theory**, Will Barker et.al., [2306.14953v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14953v1)

 We construct a theory of gravity in which a propagating massive vector field arises from a quadratic curvature invariant. The Einstein-Cartan formulation and a partial suppression of torsion ensure the absence of ghost and strong-coupling problems, as we prove with nonlinear Lagrangian and Hamiltonian analysis. Augmenting General Relativity with a propagating torsion vector, our theory provides a purely gravitational origin of Einstein-Proca models and constrains their parameter space. As an outlook to phenomenology, we discuss the gravitational production of fermionic dark matter.

2023-06-26, **Fully ab-initio all-electron calculation of dark matter--electron scattering in crystals with evaluation of systematic uncertainties**, Cyrus E. Dreyer et.al., [2306.14944v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14944v1)

 We calculate target-material responses for dark matter--electron scattering at the \textit{ab-initio} all-electron level using atom-centered gaussian basis sets. The all-electron effects enhance the material response at high momentum transfers from dark matter to electrons, $q\gtrsim \mathcal{O}\left({10\ \alpha m\_e}\right)$, compared to calculations using conventional plane wave methods, including those used in QEDark; this enhances the expected event rates at energy transfers $E \gtrsim 10$~eV, especially when scattering through heavy mediators. We carefully test a range of systematic uncertainties in the theory calculation, including those arising from the choice of basis set, exchange-correlation functional, number of unit cells in the Bloch sum, $\mathbf{k}$-mesh, and neglect of scatters with very high momentum transfers. We provide state-of-the-art crystal form factors, focusing on silicon and germanium. Our code and results are made publicly available as a new tool, called Quantum Chemistry Dark (``QCDark'').

2023-06-26, **From WIMPs to FIMPs with Low Reheating Temperatures**, Javier Silva-Malpartida et.al., [2306.14943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14943v1)

 Weakly- and Feebly-Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs and FIMPs) are among the best-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates. In this paper, we investigate the production of DM through the WIMP and FIMP mechanisms during inflationary reheating. We show that the details of the reheating, such as the inflaton potential and the reheating temperature, have a strong impact on the genesis of DM. The strong entropy injection caused by the inflaton decay has to be compensated by a reduction of the portal coupling in the case of WIMPs, or by an increase in the case of FIMPs. We pinpoint the smooth transition between the WIMP and the FIMP regimes in the case of low reheating temperature. As an example, we perform a full numerical analysis of the singlet-scalar DM model; however, our results are generic and adaptable to other particle DM candidates. Interestingly, in the singlet-scalar DM model with low-reheating temperature, regions favored by the FIMP mechanism are already being tested by direct detection experiments such as LZ and XENONnT.

2023-06-26, **Testing Modified Gravity with Coupled Microspheres**, Ankit Kumar et.al., [2306.14938v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14938v1)

 While a wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena suggest the presence of Dark Matter, all evidence remains via its gravitational effect on the known matter. As such, it is conceivable that this evidence could be explained by a modification to gravitation or concepts of inertia. Various formulations of modified gravity exist, each giving rise to several non-canonical outcomes. This motivates us to propose experiments searching for departures from (quantum) Newtonian predictions in a bipartite setting with gravitational accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$, i.e., where the effective force needs to be stronger than Newtonian to account for the Dark Matter effects. Since quantum particles naturally source weak gravitation, their non-relativistic dynamics offers opportunities to test this small acceleration regime. We show that two nearby quantum particles accumulate significantly larger entanglement in modified gravity models, such as the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We demonstrate how the temperature can be fine-tuned such that these effects are certified simply by witnessing the entanglement generated from uncorrelated thermal states, eliminating the need for precise noise characterisation. Our second regime of interest is bipartite dynamics in the presence of external gravitational fields. The MOND model does not adhere to the Strong Equivalence Principle, leading to anisotropic mutual attraction dependent on the orientation of the symmetry axis with respect to the external field. We calculate the temporal resolution required to detect this phenomenon on Earth.

2023-06-26, **The temporal evolution of gas accretion onto the discs of simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies**, F. G. Iza et.al., [2306.14760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14760v1)

 In the standard model of structure formation, galaxies form in the centre of dark matter haloes that develop as a result of inhomogeneities in the primordial mass distribution of the Universe. Afterwards, galaxies grow by means of continuous accretion of gaseous material stemming from the intergalactic medium, both in diffuse form and through collisions with other systems. After an initial period of violent growth, the gas settles into a rotationally-supported structure where stars are born, giving birth to the stellar disc. The accretion of gaseous material onto the disc plays a fundamental role in its evolution as it can change its dynamical and morphological properties, generating gas flows within the disc. In this work, we use 30 galaxies from the Auriga Project, a set of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of disc galaxies, to study the temporal dependence of the gas accretion rates, focusing on the inflowing and outflowing fluxes.

2023-06-26, **A Way of Determination of Axion Mass with Quantum Hall Effect**, Aiichi Iwazaki et.al., [2306.14475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14475v1)

 Axion dark matter is converted to electromagnetic radiations in the presence of strong magnetic field. The radiations possibly give rise to non trivial phenomena in condensed matter physics. Especially, we discuss that saturation of plateau-plateau transition width observed at low temperature in integer quantum Hall effect is caused by the axion. The radiations from axions are inevitably present in the experiment. Although the radiations generated by axion is extremely weak, Hall conductivity jumps up to next plateau even if only a single electron occupies an extended state; a localized electron is transited to the extended state by absorbing the radiation. According to our analysis, previous experiment\cite{sat6} of the saturation in detail suggests that the axion mass is in the range $10^{-5}\mbox{eV}\sim 10^{-6}$eV. We propose a way of the determination of the axion mass by imposing microwaves on Hall bar and also a way of the confirmation that the axion really causes the saturation of the width.

 The ratio of the H$\alpha$ and radio continuum intensities in the North Polar Spur (NPS) is measured to be $\lesssim 50$, two orders of magnitude smaller than the values observed in the typical shell-type old supernova remnants (SNRs), Cygnus Loop and S147, of $\sim 10^4$.The extremely low} H$\alpha$-to-radio intensity ratio favors the GC explosion model}, which postulates a giant shock wave in the hot and low-density Galactic halo with low hydrogen recombination rate, over the local supernova(e) remnant model.

2023-06-27, **Mass distribution for single-lined hot subdwarf stars in LAMOST**, Zhenxin Lei et.al., [2306.15342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15342v1)

 Masses for 664 single-lined hot subdwarf stars identified in LAMOST were calculated by comparing synthetic fluxes from spectral energy distribution (SED) with observed fluxes from virtual observatory service. Three groups of hot subdwarf stars were selected from the whole sample according to their parallax precision to study the mass distributions. We found, that He-poor sdB/sdOB stars present a wide mass distribution from 0.1 to 1.0 $\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$ with a sharp mass peak around at 0.46 $\rm{M}\_{\odot}$, which is consistent with canonical binary model prediction. He-rich sdB/sdOB/sdO stars present a much flatter mass distribution than He-poor sdB/sdOB stars and with a mass peak around 0.42 $\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$. By comparing the observed mass distributions to the predictions of different formation scenarios, we concluded that the binary merger channel, including two helium white dwarfs (He-WDs) and He-WD + main sequence (MS) merger, cannot be the only main formation channel for He-rich hot subdwarfs, and other formation channels such as the surviving companions from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) could also make impacts on producing this special population, especially for He-rich hot subdwarfs with masses less than 0.44 $\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$. He-poor sdO stars also present a flatter mass distribution with an inconspicuous peak mass at 0.18 $\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$. The similar mass - $\Delta RV\_\mathrm{max}$ distribution between He-poor sdB/sdOB and sdO stars supports the scenario that He-poor sdO stars could be the subsequent evolution stage of He-poor sdB/sdOB stars.

2023-06-27, **A pre-explosion effervescent zone for the circumstellar material in SN 2023ixf**, Noam Soker et.al., [2306.15270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15270v1)

 I present the effervescent zone model to account for the compact dense circumstellar material (CSM) around the progenitor of the core collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 2023ixf. The effervescent zone is composed of bound dense clumps that are lifted by stellar pulsation and envelope convection to distances of tens AUs, and then fall back. The dense clumps provide most of the compact CSM mass and exist alongside the regular (escaping) wind. I crudely estimate that for a compact CSM within ~30 AU that contains ~0.01 Mo, the density of each clump is >3000 times the density of the regular wind at the same radius and that the total volume filling factor of the clumps is several percent. The clumps might cover only a small fraction of the CCSN photosphere in the first days post-explosion, accounting for the lack of strong narrow absorption lines. The long-lived effervescent zone is compatible with no evidence for outbursts in the years prior to SN 2023ixf explosion and the large-amplitude pulsations of its progenitor, and it is an alternative to the CSM scenario of several-years-long high mass loss rate wind.

2023-06-26, **Supernovae and superbursts by dark matter clumps**, Nirmal Raj et.al., [2306.14981v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14981v1)

 Cosmologies in which dark matter clumps strongly on small scales are unfavorable to terrestrial detectors that are as yet unexposed to the clumps. I show that sub-hectometer clumps could trigger thermonuclear runaways by scattering on nuclei in white dwarf cores (carbon and oxygen) and neutron star oceans (carbon), setting off Type Ia-like supernovae and x-ray superbursts respectively. I consider two scenarios: ``dark clusters" that are essentially microhalos, and ``long-range dark nuggets", essentially macroscopic composites, with long-range Yukawa baryonic interactions that source the energy for igniting explosions. I constrain dark clusters weighing between the Planck mass and asteroid masses, and long-range dark nuggets over a wider mass range spanning forty orders of magnitude. These limits greatly complement searches I had co-proposed in 2109.04582 for scattering interactions of dark clumps in neutron stars, cosmic rays, and pre-historic minerals.
