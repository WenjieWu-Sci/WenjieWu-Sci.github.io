2025-08-12, **Quantum Sensing Radiative Decays of Neutrinos and Dark Matter Particles**, Zhongtian Dong et.al., [2508.09139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09139v1)

 We explore a novel strategy for detecting the radiative decay of very weakly interacting particles by leveraging the extreme sensitivity of quantum devices, such as superconducting transmon qubits and trapped ion systems, to faint electromagnetic signals. By modeling the effective electric field induced by the decay photons, we evaluate the response of quantum sensors across two particle physics scenarios: the cosmic neutrino background and two-component dark matter. We assess the discovery potential of these devices and outline the parameter space accessible under current experimental capabilities. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum sensors can probe radiative decays of dark matter candidates using existing technology, while probing neutrino magnetic moments beyond current limits will require scalable quantum architectures with enhanced coherence.

2025-08-12, **Multi-Energy and Multi-Sample Searches for Neutrinos from GW Events**, Aswathi Balagopal V. et.al., [2508.09034v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09034v1)

 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole detects neutrinos of astrophysical origin via their interactions with ice. The main array is optimized for the detection of neutrinos with energies above 1 TeV. A much smaller infill array, known as IceCube DeepCore, extends the sensitivity down to a few GeV. Neutrinos observed in both parts of the detector are used for astrophysical-source searches with multiple messengers. We present two analyses that follow up archival gravitational wave (GW) events from runs O1 through O3 of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. The first analysis uses two neutrino datasets: one with high-energy tracks and another consisting of low-energy tracks and cascades. These two neutrino datasets were previously used independently to follow-up GW events. In the analysis presented here, a combined likelihood search is performed using both datasets to search for neutrinos coincident with the GW events across a wide energy range, from a few GeV to several PeV. The second analysis, for the first time, uses a neutrino-induced cascade sample with events of energy above ~1 TeV for searches of coincident neutrino-GW emission. We present results from both analyses and discuss prospects for conducting these analyses in real time.

2025-08-12, **Sensitivity of $W$-boson measurements to low-mass right-handed neutrinos**, Rodrigo Alonso et.al., [2508.08903v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08903v1)

 A low-mass right-handed neutrino could interact with electroweak bosons via mixing, a mediator particle, or loop corrections. Using an effective field theory, we determine constraints on these interactions from $W$-boson measurements at hadron colliders. Due to the difference in the initial states at the Tevatron and the LHC, $W$-boson decays to a right-handed neutrino would artificially increase the mass measured at the Tevatron while only affecting the difference between $W^+$ and $W^-$ mass measurements at the LHC. Measurements from CDF and the LHC are used to infer the corresponding parameter values, which are found to be inconsistent between the two. The LHC experiments can improve sensitivity to these interactions by measuring the cosine of the helicity angle using $W$ bosons produced with transverse momentum above $\approx 50$ GeV.

2025-08-12, **Constraining Super-Heavy Dark Matter with the KM3-230213A Neutrino Event**, Roberto Aloisio et.al., [2508.08779v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08779v1)

 Recently, the KM3NeT collaboration detected an astrophysical neutrino event, KM3-230213A, with an energy of approximately $220~\rm PeV$, providing unprecedented insights into the ultra-high-energy Universe. In this study, we introduce a novel likelihood framework designed to leverage this event to constrain the properties of super-heavy dark matter (SHDM) decay. Our approach systematically integrates multi-messenger constraints from galactic and extragalactic neutrino flux measurements by IceCube, the absence of comparable neutrino events at IceCube and Auger observatories, and the latest gamma-ray experiment upper limits. Our findings impose the most stringent constraints to date, placing a lower bound on the SHDM lifetime at $\gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{29}-10^{30} \rm s$. Importantly, we identify, for the first time, the significant potential of galactic neutrino flux measurements in advancing dark matter research. Future investigations targeting astrophysical neutrinos originating from the Galactic Center at energies above $10~\rm PeV$ will be crucial, not only for understanding the origin of the cosmic-ray knee but also for exploring the possible contributions of super-heavy dark matter to our Universe.

2025-08-12, **Detecting Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter at MeV Gamma-Ray Observatories**, Subaru Fujisawa et.al., [2508.08695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08695v1)

 We explore the indirect detection of sterile neutrino dark matter within the gauged $U(1)\_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model, in which three right-handed neutrinos account for neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry, and dark matter. Focusing on the MeV mass range, we investigate two decay channels: the radiative decay $N \to \nu \gamma$, which produces a monochromatic photon, and the three-body decay $N \to e^- e^+ \nu$, which leads to a 511 keV photon signal from positronium decay. Taking the upcoming COSI mission as a case study, we show that both signals are experimentally accessible and complementary, with the 511 keV channel extending the sensitivity reach up to $O(100)$ MeV. We propose a novel analysis strategy in Compton data space to isolate the diffuse 511 keV emission. Furthermore, we incorporate, for the first time, the Sommerfeld enhancement in the decay width of $N \to e^- e^+ \nu$, enabling more accurate predictions of the signal near the kinematic threshold. The combined observation of both channels would provide a distinctive and testable signature of the sterile neutrino dark matter hypothesis.

2025-08-12, **Fluorescence time profile measurement of LAB based liquid scintillator in response to medium relativistic ion particles**, Xiaojie Luo et.al., [2508.08546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08546v1)

 Liquid scintillator is widely used in particle physics experiments due to its high light yield, good timing resolution, scalability and low cost. Certain liquid scintillators exhibit pulse shape discrimination capabilities because of difference in fluorescence timing properties induced by different particles. Its fluoresence timing properties have been measured mostly for radioactive decay sources at MeV energies. We present a novel measurement of fluorescence time properties of LAB based liquid scintillator in response to high-energy ions of hydrogen (Z = 1), helium (Z = 2) and Krypton at around 200-300 MeV/u for the first time. We compared the results to those from radioactive sources and observed a distinct $dE/dX$ dependence, regardless of the particle type. These findings are essential for physics searches such as the diffuse supernova neutrino background in large liquid scintillator detectors like JUNO, and are also critical towards understanding the underlying scintillation timing mechanism.

2025-08-11, **Oscillations and parity violation in gravitational wave background from extra tensor modes**, Jaume Garriga et.al., [2508.08481v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08481v1)

 Spectator fields which provide additional tensor degrees of freedom, on top of the standard metric tensor perturbations, can produce significant amounts of gravitational waves (GWs). Employing the effective field theory approach for spin-2 fields, we find a universal prediction that linear mixing between the metric and extra tensor modes inevitably induces oscillatory features in the GW spectrum, reminiscent of the so-called neutrino oscillation. Moreover, parity-violating operators in the spin-2 sector can imprint chiral signatures on the resulting GW background. We consider a concrete scenario in which the spin-2 field generates observable chiral GWs with characteristic oscillatory patterns. These results provide a model-independent characterization of the key signatures and observational implications of such scenarios which can be detected with future GW detectors.

2025-08-11, **Investigation of Electromagnetic and Muonic Air-Shower Components using IceTop Simulations**, Lincoln Draper et.al., [2508.08478v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08478v1)

 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory studies cosmic-ray initiated extensive air showers (EASs) using the IceTop surface array, which is sensitive to the electromagnetic component and low-energy ($\sim$ GeV) muonic component of EASs. The contribution from the two components is reconstructed on an event-by-event basis by simultaneously fitting separate lateral distribution functions (LDFs) for both the electromagnetic and muonic components of each shower. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of the two-component LDF reconstruction to recreate the muon distribution in IceTop accurately. The parameters characterizing the reconstructed muonic LDF can vary significantly based on the choice of hadronic interaction model. Thus, the dependence of the reconstructed muon LDF and other parameters on the hadronic interaction models is investigated.

2025-08-11, **Precision calculation of $N_{\text{eff}}$ with Neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo**, Oleksii Ihnatenko et.al., [2508.08379v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08379v1)

 Neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach ($\nu$DSMC) is a method of solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation in the Early Universe, proposed to study the evolution of neutrinos under various cosmological setups. We formulate a complete $\nu$DSMC solver, incorporating the effects of the electron mass, neutrino oscillations, and quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of the electromagnetic plasma. We then apply it for performing precise calculations of neutrino decoupling in the standard cosmological scenario. We obtain the value $N\_{\text{eff}} = 3.0439\pm 0.0006$, in agreement with the state-of-the-art calculations.

2025-08-11, **SN 2023uqf: An Interacting Supernova Coincident with a High-Energy Neutrino**, Robert Stein et.al., [2508.08355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08355v1)

 Astrophysical high-energy (TeV-PeV) neutrinos were first discovered in 2013, but their origin remains largely unknown. Here we present SN 2023uqf, a supernova found in coincidence with high-energy neutrino IC231004A, as part of a systematic optical follow-up program with the Zwicky Transient Facility. SN 2023uqf had a luminous and rapidly-evolving lightcurve, and spectroscopic observations indicated that the source was a Type Ibn supernova. Spectroscopic signatures confirm ongoing interaction between the supernova ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium, as expected for high-energy neutrino production in a core-collapse supernova. Given the rare nature of Type Ibn supernovae, SN 2023uqf is unlikely to have been discovered by chance over the course of our program (p=0.3%). Our discovery of SN 2023uqf provides the first observational evidence to support long-held theories that interacting supernovae can serve as cosmic hadron accelerators.

2025-08-11, **Coupled Time-Dependent Proton Acceleration and Leptonic-Hadronic Radiation in Turbulent Supermassive Black Hole Coronae**, Chengchao Yuan et.al., [2508.08233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08233v1)

 Turbulent coronae of supermassive black holes can accelerate non-thermal particles to high energies and produce observable radiation, but capturing this process is challenging due to comparable timescales of acceleration, cooling, and the development of cascades. We present a time-dependent numerical framework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration -- modeled by the Fokker-Planck equation -- with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in non-jetted tidal disruption events like AT 2019dsg, and show that early-stage cascade feedback can impact proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\mathcal O(100~\rm d)$. This flexible code efficiently models multi-messenger signals from both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in combining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms.

2025-08-11, **Neutrino and Electromagnetic Signals from Tidal Disruption Events: Bridging the Theory with Observations**, Chengchao Yuan et.al., [2508.07940v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07940v1)

 This proceeding presents recent results from a joint analysis of time-dependent neutrino and electromagnetic emissions from tidal disruption events (TDEs), using both isotropic wind models and relativistic jets. We discuss constraints from Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) $\gamma$-ray upper limits on the size of the radiation zone and the maximum energies of accelerated cosmic rays, as well as the resulting neutrino productions from TDEs and candidates, including AT 2019dsg, AT 2019fdr, AT 2019aalc, and AT 2021lwx. The Fermi upper limits correspond to a generic neutrino detection rate of $\lesssim0.01-0.1$ per TDE. Additionally, we explore multi-wavelength modeling of jetted TDEs with luminous X-ray afterglows, another TDE subclass, by incorporating the dynamics of structured jets with time-dependent energy injection. We also examine the connection between neutrinos and their multi-wavelength counterparts, highlighting implications for future multi-messenger discoveries with IceCube, IceCube-Gen2, KM3NeT, and Fermi-LAT.

2025-08-11, **A Highly Predictive Neutrino Model: The Step Toward Precision**, Pralay Chakraborty et.al., [2508.07837v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07837v1)

 A highly predictive neutrino mass matrix texture is proposed. The texture is minimal and carries two interesting correlations. It gives precise and unambiguous answers to almost all the current issues related to observable parameters in neutrino phenomenology. The texture is developed in a framework of type-I + type-II seesaw mechanisms with an extended group structure of $SU(2)\_L \times U(1)\_Y \times A\_4 \times Z\_{10} \times Z\_{7} \times Z\_{3}$.

2025-08-11, **tilepy: Smart Scheduling for Multi-Messenger Astronomy from Earth to Orbit**, Halim Ashkar et.al., [2508.07824v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07824v1)

 The rise of direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) started a new era in multi-messenger astrophysics. Like GWs, many other astrophysical transient sources suffer from poor localization, which can span tens to thousands of square degrees in the sky. Moreover, as the detection horizon for these transients widens and the detection rate increases, current electromagnetic follow-up facilities require tools to optimize the follow-up of poorly localized events and save valuable telescope time for their time-domain astrophysics programs. We present \texttt{tilepy}, a Python library, and a tool to optimize the follow-up of poorly localized transient events. \texttt{tilepy} is used for GWs as well as other poorly localized events such as gamma-ray bursts detected by Fermi-GBM and neutrino candidates from IceCube. \texttt{tilepy} has also been optimized to integrate smoothly with multiple ground-based observatories operating individually or simultaneously with diverse observational configurations. In this contribution, we introduce the latest developments from \texttt{tilepy}, mainly the ability to operate with space-based observatories while taking into consideration factors such as Earth, Sun, and Moon occultation and South Atlantic Anomaly passage. We present innovations to the platform, handling a variety of field of view shapes, the possibility of optimizing observation scheduling with artificial intelligence tools and examples of its use on transient astrophysical events.

2025-08-11, **Monte Carlo study of KDAR $ν_μ$ charged-current scattering on carbon**, Ritesh Kumar Pradhan et.al., [2508.07772v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07772v1)

 The neutrino energy reconstruction is crucial for reducing systematic uncertainties in neutrino oscillation experiments and improving cross-section measurements. Kaon-Decays-At-Rest (KDAR) neutrinos provide a unique opportunity to probe neutrino-nucleus interactions at low energies with a precisely known energy of 235.5 MeV. This work presents Monte Carlo predictions of missing energy due to nuclear effects in the KDAR $\nu\_\mu$ charged-current scattering on the carbon nucleus for JSNS$^2$. The predictions from GENIE, NuWro, and GiBUU show a significant impact of nuclear and final state interaction (FSI) models, as well as nucleon removal energy, on missing energy reconstruction. Tuning the hA FSI model improves the predictions from GENIE. It is also observed that the nucleon elastic component of FSI leads to better predictions in NuWro compared to GENIE. NuWro shows the best agreement with data among the generators considered; however, the observed discrepancies with data across all generators highlight the limitations of current theoretical descriptions in the low-energy regime and the need for improvements in Monte Carlo modeling.

2025-08-11, **On phenomenological relations for masses and mixing parameters of quarks and leptons**, V. V. Khruschov et.al., [2508.07661v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07661v1)

 A comparative analysis of a number of phenomenological relationships between constants of the extended Standard Model of electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions of fundamental particles (hereinafter referred to as the extended Standard Model) is carried out to detect possible correlations between constants in the quark and lepton sectors. The presence of such correlations may indicate connections between constants within a more general theory than the extended Standard Model. Phenomenological relationships between masses of current and constituent quarks and mixing angles are considered. A phenomenological relationship between neutrino masses and neutrino mixing angle is found. The quark-lepton complementarity relationship for quark and neutrino mixing angles is confirmed. A typical estimate of the accuracy of such relationships is given. Estimates of the masses of sterile (right-handed) neutrinos are obtained at the phenomenological level using the seesaw mechanism. In this case, it is assumed that the values of the active neutrino masses depend on three characteristic scales, and the sum of the active neutrino masses is limited from above by $0.06$~eV. An example of a grand unification theory and possible stages of spontaneous breaking of its gauge symmetry to the level of gauge symmetry of the extended Standard Model due to additional Higgs particles are considered.

2025-08-12, **Superheavy Q-Balls and Cosmology**, J. McDonald et.al., [2508.08931v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08931v1)

 We propose a model for the cosmological formation of superheavy Q-Balls in the mass range $10^{-7} \, M\_{\odot}$ to $10^{6} \, M\_{\odot}$. The model is based on a hidden sector scalar potential motivated by broken scale invariance, for which analytic Q-ball solutions and numerical simulations of condensate fragmentation exist. We show that this potential can produce superheavy Q-balls during the radiation-dominated era. As an example, we show that it is possible to produce Q-balls of mass $ \sim \,10^{6} \, M\_{\odot}$ and diameter $\sim$ 100 light years, with a number density $\sim 1$ per galaxy. Such early-forming superheavy Q-balls could play a role in galaxy and supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation. We also show that it is possible to form smaller mass Q-balls with large numbers per galaxy volume, that could form SMBH by merging. Finally, we show that it is possible to produce asteroid mass Q-balls that could account for all of the dark matter whilst remaining consistent with observational limits on MACHOs.

2025-08-12, **Search for Slow Bars in Two Barred Galaxies with Nuclear Structures: NGC 6951 and NGC 7716**, Yun Hee Lee et.al., [2508.08710v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08710v1)

 We investigate two barred galaxies with nuclear structures, NGC 6951 and NGC 7716, to examine whether they host slow bars. Using Gemini/GMOS long-slit spectroscopy, we calculate the bar pattern speed with the Tremaine-Weinberg method and detect kinematically decoupled nuclear disks in both galaxies. We also measure the bar length and strength using Pan-STARRs images and identify a nuclear ring in NGC 6951 and a nuclear bar in NGC 7716 from HST/PC images. Our results indicate that NGC 6951 hosts a slow, long, and strong bar, which likely evolved through interactions with the dark matter halo and contributed to the formation of both the nuclear disk and ring. We also find hints of a rapidly rotating oval structure within the primary bar, although it is not clearly seen in the imaging data. In contrast, the primary bar in NGC 7716 is too weak to be classified as a barred galaxy, while its nuclear disk and nuclear bar are unusually large, possibly due to tidal interactions or the weakness of the primary bar. These findings suggest that slow bars may be more observed in galaxies with nuclear structures and highlight the often underappreciated role of galaxy interactions in bar evolution.

2025-08-12, **WIMP Dark Matter within the dark photon portal**, X. G. Wang et.al., [2508.08676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08676v1)

 We test the dark photon as a portal connecting to the dark sector in the case of Dirac fermion and complex scalar dark matter with masses up to 1 TeV. Both the dark photon and the $Z$ boson contribute to the dark matter annihilation and dark matter--nucleon scattering processes. We derive the lower limits on the dark parameters from thermal relic density. The corresponding spin-independent dark matter--proton cross sections are compared with the upper bounds set by direct detection. We explore the allowed regions of the dark parameter space that are consistent with these constraints.

2025-08-12, **Particle physics models of interacting bosonic dark energy and fermionic dark matter in Einstein scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity**, Simran Arora et.al., [2508.08638v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08638v1)

 We explore a cosmological framework in which a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field, acting as dark energy, interacts with a fermionic dark matter field through a coupling obtained from the point of view of particle physics. This setup is inspired by string/M-theory, and two representative scalar field potentials are investigated: exponential and power-law. A distinctive feature of the GB-coupled models is their potential to alter the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GWs), a property with significant implications in light of recent multi-messenger astrophysical observations. To account for this, we analyze models under two scenarios: one where the GW speed differs from that of light and the other where they are equal, but all consistent with current observational constraints. The dynamical evolution of the system is investigated by reformulating the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system, enabling a detailed analysis of the Universe's long-term behavior, including the radiation-, matter- and dark energy-dominated epochs. We constrain the model parameters using a broad set of recent observational data, including mock high-redshift measurements from the Roman Space Telescope. Our findings indicate that both potentials yield cosmologies that are in excellent agreement with current data, closely tracking the expansion history predicted by the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model, while still allowing room for subtle deviations that could be tested by future observations.

2025-08-11, **Radio Killed the Axion Star: Constraining Axion Properties with Radio Telescopes**, Patrick J. Fox et.al., [2508.08371v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08371v1)

 Axion dark matter or any ultralight bosonic dark matter can go through Bose-Einstein condensation due to the large phase density, leading to the formation of axion stars or solitons in dark matter halo centers. The formation rate is enhanced in the presence of the substructures expected in the post-inflationary scenario for the QCD axion or axion-like particles. An axion star will continue to grow until a critical mass is reached, after which it collapses and then explodes, with the emission of relativistic axions, in a process called an ``axinovae.'' There can also be accompanying photon emission due to the stimulated decay of axions in the coherent compact axion star. In axion models with a modest enhancement ($\kappa\sim \mathcal{O}(10)$) of the axion-photon coupling $g\_{a\gamma}= \kappa \alpha/(2\pi f\_a)$ axinovae will contain a significant flux of radio photons. We determine the range of parameters over which axinovae can be detectable with radio transient searches.

2025-08-11, **On bursty star formation during cosmological reionization -- influence on the metal and dust content of low-mass galaxies**, Anand Menon et.al., [2508.08363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08363v1)

 Observations indicate that high-redshift galaxies undergo episodic star formation bursts, driving strong outflows that expel gas and suppress accretion. We investigate the consequences for metal and dust content of galaxies at $z\geq\!5$ using our semi-analytical model, ASHVINI. We track gas-phase and stellar metallicities $(Z\_\text{g}, Z\_\star)$ and dust mass $(M\_{\rm d})$ in dark matter haloes spanning $M\_{\rm h} = 10^6 - 10^{11}\,M\_\odot$, comparing continuous and bursty star formation scenarios, which reflect underlying assumptions of instantaneous and delayed feedback, and we allow for metallicity-dependent feedback efficiency. Delayed feedback induces oscillations in $Z\_{\rm g}$ and $Z\_\star$, with $Z\_{\rm g}$ declining sharply at low stellar and halo masses. This decline shifts to higher stellar and halo masses as the redshift decreases. Reionization introduces significant scatter, producing an upturn followed by rapid $Z\_{\rm g}$ decline. Metallicity-dependent feedback moderates this decline at $z=7-10$, flattening the $Z\_{\rm g}$-mass relation to $\simeq 0.03 - 0.04\,Z\_\odot$. Dust production tracks $Z\_{\rm g}$ but is sensitive to burst history, causing delayed enrichment. Our results show that burst-driven feedback decouples $Z\_{\rm g}$ and $Z\_\star$, imprints intrinsic scatter in mass-metallicity relations, and delays dust growth. These effects are strongest in low-mass halos $(M\_{\rm h}\sim 10^7\,M\_\odot)$, where shallow potentials amplify the impact of feedback. Our results are consistent with recent hydrodynamical and semi-analytical simulations and provides context for interpreting JWST metallicity and dust measurements, highlighting the importance of episodic star formation in early galaxy chemical evolution.

2025-08-11, **JWST Discovery of Strong Lensing from a Galaxy Cluster at Cosmic Noon: Giant Arcs and a Highly Concentrated Core of XLSSC 122**, Kyle Finner et.al., [2508.08356v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08356v1)

 Our observations with the James Webb Space Telescope have made the remarkable discovery of strong gravitational lensing arcs from XLSSC 122 ($z=1.98$) - setting the record for the most distant galaxy cluster that exhibits strong lensing. The discovery of giant arcs enables a strong-lensing analysis and a measurement of the concentration of the dark matter halo. We perform a strong-lensing analysis of the cluster and measure the radial projected mass density profile. Our measurements reveal an exceptionally high concentration in the core of XLSSC 122. A Navarro--Frenk--White profile fit to the inner 100 kpc estimates the concentration to be $6.3\pm0.5$. The high concentration of XLSSC 122 contributes to the emerging picture that massive structure formation in the early universe may proceed more rapidly than standard models suggest. We estimate the mass within 100 kpc to be $M$($R<$100 kpc) = $6.5\pm0.7\times10^{13}$ M$\_\odot$. Our mosaic images are made public at https://kylefinner.github.io/xlssc122 .

2025-08-11, **Sensitivity toward dark matter annihilation imprints on 21-cm signal with SKA-Low: A convolutional neural network approach**, Pravin Kumar Natwariya et.al., [2508.08251v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08251v1)

 This study investigates the sensitivity of the radio interferometers to identify imprints of spatially inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation signatures in the 21-cm signal during the pre-reionization era. We focus on the upcoming low-mode survey of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low) telescope. Using CNNs, we analyze simulated 3D 21-cm differential brightness temperature maps generated via the DM21cm code, which is based on 21cmFAST and DarkHistory, to distinguish between spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous energy injection/deposition scenarios arising from dark matter annihilation. The inhomogeneous case accounts for local dark matter density contrasts and gas properties, such as thermal and ionization states, while the homogeneous model assumes uniform energy deposition. Our study focuses on two primary annihilation channels to electron-positron pairs ($e^+e^-$) and photons ( $\gamma \gamma$), exploring dark matter masses from 1 MeV to 100 MeV and a range of annihilation cross-sections. For $\gamma \gamma$ channel, the distinction across dark matter models is less pronounced due to the larger mean free path of the emitted photons, resulting in a more uniform energy deposition. For $e^+e^-$ channel, the results indicate that the CNNs can effectively differentiate between the inhomogeneous and homogeneous cases. Despite observational challenges, the results demonstrate that these effects remain detectable even after incorporating noise from next-generation radio interferometers, such as the SKA. We find that the inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the 21-cm signal maps distinguishable from the homogeneous scenarios for the dark matter masses $m\_{\rm DM}=1$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of $\geq 5 \times 10^{-30}~{\rm cm^3/sec}$ ($\geq 5 \times 10^{-29}~{\rm cm^3/sec}$ for $m\_{\rm DM}=100$ MeV) for moderate SKA-Low noise.

2025-08-11, **Closing the Mass Window for Stupendously Large Black Holes**, Christopher Gerlach et.al., [2508.08238v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08238v1)

 We show that primordial black holes (PBHs) in the $\textit{Stupendously Large Black Hole}$ mass range ($M \gtrsim 10^{11}\,M\_\odot$) produce isocurvature perturbations exceeding current $\textit{Planck}$ Cosmic Microwave Background limits, thereby excluding them as a significant dark matter component.

2025-08-11, **Sensitivity of an Early Dark Matter Search using the Electromagnetic Calorimeter as a Target for the Light Dark Matter eXperiment**, LDMX Collaboration et.al., [2508.08121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08121v1)

 The Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) is proposed to employ a thin tungsten target and a multi-GeV electron beam to carry out a missing momentum search for the production of dark matter candidate particles. We study the sensitivity for a complementary missing-energy-based search using the LDMX Electromagnetic Calorimeter as an active target with a focus on early running. In this context, we construct an event selection from a limited set of variables that projects sensitivity into previously-unexplored regions of light dark matter phase space -- down to an effective dark photon interaction strength $y$ of approximately $2\times10^{-13}$ ($5\times10^{-12}$) for a 1MeV (10MeV) dark matter candidate mass.

2025-08-11, **Dynamical Black Hole in the accelerating Universe approaching the future singularity -- Possible origin of (super-)massive black holes**, Shin'ichi Nojiri et.al., [2508.07524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07524v1)

 We construct and investigate the dynamical black hole spacetime embedded in the expanding universe filled with cosmic fluid, such as dark energy. When the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact solutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is embedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known McVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends on the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with the expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or during inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes suggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the cosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters the epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour of black holes around different future singularities are carefully investigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the tidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended object, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.   We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside the black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the spherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon, it becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the radius of the singularity becomes infinite.

 Gaia has recently revealed a population of over 20 compact objects in wide astrometric binaries, while LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) have observed around 100 compact object binaries as gravitational-wave (GW) mergers. Despite belonging to different systems, the compact objects discovered by both Gaia and the LVK follow a multimodal mass distribution, with a global maximum at neutron star (NS) masses ($\sim 1$-$2\,M\_\odot$) and a secondary local maximum at black hole (BH) masses $\sim10\,M\_\odot$. However, the relative dearth of objects, or ``mass gap," between these modes is more pronounced among the wide binaries observed by Gaia compared to the GW population, with $9^{+10}\_{-6}\%$ of GW component masses falling between $2.5$--$5\,M\_\odot$ compared to $\lesssim5\%$ of Gaia compact objects. We explore whether this discrepancy can be explained by the natal kicks received by low-mass BHs. GW progenitor binaries may be more likely to survive natal kicks, because the newborn BH has a more massive companion and/or is in a tighter binary than Gaia progenitor binaries. We compare the survival probabilities of Gaia and GW progenitor binaries as a function of natal kick strength and pre-supernova binary parameters, and map out the parameter space and kick strength required to disrupt the progenitor binaries leading to low-mass BHs in Gaia systems more frequently than those in GW systems.

 In the present article, we propose a very simple parametrization of the Hubble function without parametrizing the dark components of the Universe. One of the novelties of the parametrization is that it may include a wide variety of the cosmological models, such as dark energy (both noninteracting and interacting fluids), modified gravity, cosmological matter creation and other known scenarios. The model is constrained with the latest astronomical probes from Hubble parameter measurements, three distinct versions of Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+, DESY5, Union3) and baryon acoustic oscillations from Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument data releases 1 and 2. Our results suggest a mild deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for most of the combined datasets. We also find that our model is thermodynamically consistent and performs well in the model comparison tests.

2025-08-11, **No Metallicity Preference in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies**, Shotaro Yamasaki et.al., [2508.07688v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07688v1)

 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients of unknown origin, and studying their host galaxies could offer clues to constrain progenitor models. Among various host properties, gas-phase metallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and the production of transients. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host galaxies to date, measuring oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) = 8.04-8.84) for 40 hosts using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited subsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies matched in the same selection criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide range in metallicity and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted mass-metallicity relation of the star-forming galaxy population. Contrary to the earlier claim in the literature, we find no clear lower bound on metallicity, suggesting that metallicity alone does not strictly regulate FRB production. Encouragingly, this implies FRBs can form even in low-metallicity, high-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter distribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal ($\sim$2$\sigma$) evidence for a -0.09 $\pm$ 0.04 dex metallicity offset from the fundamental metallicity relation, likely due to suppressed SFRs at fixed mass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. This offset resembles that observed in local post-merger galaxies, and may reflect a post-starburst phase following galaxy interactions, where FRB progenitors formed during the starburst produce FRBs after a 100-500 Myr delay, consistent with observed delay-time distributions and favoring binary evolution channels over core-collapse supernovae.
