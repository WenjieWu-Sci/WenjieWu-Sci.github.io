2025-05-27, **Modular-symmetry-protected seesaw**, A. Granelli et.al., [2505.21405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21405v1)

 In the presence of a finite modular flavour symmetry, fermion mass hierarchies may be generated by a slight deviation of the modulus from a symmetric point. We point out that this small parameter governing charged-lepton mass hierarchies may also be responsible for the breaking of lepton number in a symmetry-protected low-scale seesaw, sourcing active neutrino masses and the mass splitting of a pseudo-Dirac pair of heavy neutrinos. We look into the phenomenological implications of this mechanism.

2025-05-27, **The UV Laser Calibration System for measuring the Electric field in the SBND**, Shivaraj Mulleria Babu et.al., [2505.21151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21151v1)

 The Short Baseline Near Detector (SBND) is a LArTPC detector, located 110 meters from the Fermilab's Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB). It is designed to measure neutrino cross-section and aid in searches for excess electron like neutrino events. The electric field inside the SBND-TPC may have distortions due to a number of reasons, such as the space charge effect. The space charge effect comes from the abundance of cosmic rays that ionize the argon, producing copious positive argon ions. In this case, we need an alternative solution to determine the electric field distortion inside the TPC volume and compensate for the possible distortion in the spatial information. The UV Laser system is one such attempt to determine the electric field distortion. By utilising a high energy ultraviolet laser beam, the system can map the spatial distortions within the TPC volume and provide the necessary corrections to ensure accurate spatial and calorimetric measurements.

2025-05-27, **On chirality and chiral neutrino oscillations**, Evgeny Akhmedov et.al., [2505.20982v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20982v1)

 It has been claimed in a number of publications that neutrinos can exhibit chirality oscillations. In this note we discuss the notion of chirality and show that chiral neutrino oscillations in vacuum do not occur. We argue that the incorrect claims to the contrary resulted from a failure to clearly discriminate between quantum fields, states and wave functions. We also emphasize the role played in the erroneous claims on the possibility of chirality oscillations by the widely spread misconceptions about negative energies.

2025-05-27, **Parametrizing the reconstruction performance of Super-Kamiokande in the Sub-GeV to TeV neutrino energy range**, C. Jesús-Valls et.al., [2505.20812v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20812v1)

 Super-Kamiokande is a paramount detector for studying atmospheric, astrophysical and accelerator neutrino physics. This work extracts and characterizes the neutrino reconstruction performance of Super-Kamiokande using the public data release from its latest atmospheric neutrino analysis. Energy and zenith angle reconstruction performances are derived and modeled for neutrinos spanning sub-GeV to TeV energies across different event samples and sample-specific and sample-aggregated performances are provided. These metrics enable realistic detector response modeling in phenomenological studies, establish benchmarks for evaluating alternative reconstruction algorithms, facilitate quantitative performance comparisons with other experiments, and provide a baseline performance model for the future Hyper-Kamiokande detector. This study represents the first publicly available comprehensive model to describe neutrino reconstruction in Super-Kamiokande in the Sub-GeV to TeV energies.

2025-05-27, **The Extreme Universe Observatory on a Super-Pressure Balloon II: Mission, Payload, and Flight**, James. H. Adams Jr. et.al., [2505.20762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20762v1)

 The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) is a pathfinder mission toward a space-based observatory such as the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). The aim of POEMMA is the observation of Ultra High Energy COsmic Rays (UHECRs) in order to elucidate their nature and origins and to discover $\gtrsim$ 20 PeV very high energy neutrinos that originate from transient and steady astrophysical sources. EUSO-SPB2 was launched from W\=anaka New Zealand on May 13th, 2023 as a NASA Balloon Program Office test flight. The mission goals included making the first near-space altitude observations of the fluorescence emission from UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) and making the first direct Cherenkov light emission from PeV cosmic rays traversing Earth's atmosphere. In addition, a Target of Opportunity program was developed for selecting and scheduling observations of potential neutrino sources as they passed just below the Earth's limb. Although a leaky balloon forced termination over the Pacific Ocean after 37 hours, data was collected to demonstrate the successful commissioning and operation of the instruments. This paper includes a description of the payload and the key instruments, pre-flight instrument characterizations in the lab and in the desert, flight operations and examples of the data collected. The flight was too short to catch a UHECR event via fluorescence, however about 10 candidate EAS events from cosmic rays were recorded via Cherenkov light.

2025-05-26, **Cosmological impact of $ν$DM interactions enhanced in narrow redshift ranges**, Sebastian Trojanowski et.al., [2505.20396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20396v1)

 The impact of dark matter-neutrino ($\nu$DM) interactions on cosmological perturbations has regained attention, spurred by indications of non-zero couplings from high-multipole cosmic microwave background data, weak lensing, and Lyman-$\alpha$ observations. We demonstrate that a similar observational preference is obtained if $\nu$DM interactions are primarily enhanced during a specific epoch, $z\sim (10^4-10^5)$, leading to $>3\sigma$ preference for a non-zero interaction in the combined Atacama Cosmology Telescope and cosmic shear data. This redshift-limited enhancement circumvents other cosmological and astrophysical bounds and can be achieved within a neutrino portal dark matter framework incorporating resonantly enhanced scattering rates.

2025-05-26, **Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities**, Damiano F. G. Fiorillo et.al., [2505.20389v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20389v1)

 In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.

2025-05-26, **A Roadmap for neutrino charge assignments in $U(2)_F$ Flavor Models: Implications for LFV processes and leptonic anomalous magnetic moments**, A. Giarnetti et.al., [2505.20281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20281v1)

 We build upon a simple $U(2)\_F$ model of flavor, in which all fermion masses and mixing hierarchies arise from powers of two small parameters controlling $U(2)\_F$ breaking. In the original formulation, an isomorphism to the discrete $D\_6\times U(1)\_F$ symmetry was invoked to generate a Majorana neutrino mass term. Here, we retain the successful features of that model for the charged leptons and quarks, while exploring alternative neutrino charge assignments within the $U(2)\_F$ framework. This approach allows us to generate Majorana neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism without introducing any additional symmetries nor invoking any isomorphism. We further examine the implications of our models for Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) decays, analyzing the processes $\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$, $\tau\rightarrow\mu\gamma$ and $\tau\rightarrow e\gamma$ and their connection with the leptonic anomalous magnetic moments. We show that within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) approach the current limits on the branching ratios of LFV decays obtained in our $U(2)\_F$ models are not compatible with the anomaly observed for $(g-2)\_\mu$, thereby suggesting that either $(g-2)\_\mu$ must be very close to the Standard Model predictions or the invoked flavor symmetry is not appropriate to describe the current anomalies.

2025-05-26, **Revisiting Flavor Model and Leptogenesis**, Takaaki Nomura et.al., [2505.19924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19924v1)

 We revisit a supersymmetric flavor model based on the symmetries $SU(2)\_L \times A\_4 \times Z\_3 \times U(1)\_R$, which extends the original Altarelli and Feruglio construction by introducing flavon and driving superfields responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the flavor symmetry in order to obtain non-zero reactor angle. The vacuum alignments of flavon fields are achieved through the minimization of the scalar potential derived from the superpotential. This setup leads to specific mass matrices for the charged leptons and neutrinos that are consistent with current experimental data, including the measured values of the lepton mixing angles and neutrino mass squared differences. We investigate whether the model can simultaneously accommodate successful thermal leptogenesis. In particular, we analyze the CP asymmetry generated in the decay of heavy Majorana neutrinos, the resulting lepton asymmetry, and its conversion to the baryon asymmetry through the electroweak sphalerons. However the CP asymmetry is zero, since the Dirac neutrino mass matrix is simple texture in the leading order for our model. Then we consider the next-leading order in Yukawa interactions of the Dirac neutrinos. Therefor, we can realize the baryon asymmetry of the universe at the present universe. By numerically scanning the parameter space, we identify the regions consistent with both neutrino oscillation data and the observed baryon asymmetry. The range of the Majorana phases may be tested in future experiments.

2025-05-26, **Observing Supernova Neutrino Light Curves with Super-Kamiokande.VI. A Practical Data Analysis Technique Considering Realistic Experimental Backgrounds**, Fumi Nakanishi et.al., [2505.19721v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19721v1)

 Neutrinos from supernovae, especially those emitted during the late phase of core collapse, are essential for understanding the final stages of massive star evolution. We have been dedicated to developing methods for the analysis of neutrinos emitted during the late phase and observed at Super-Kamiokande (SK). Our previous studies have successfully demonstrated the potential of various analysis methods in extracting essential physical properties; however, the lack of background consideration has limited their practical application. In this study, we address this issue by incorporating a realistic treatment of the experimental signal and background events with the on-going SK experiment. We therefore optimize our analysis framework to reflect realistic observational conditions, including both signal and background events. Using this framework we study several long-time supernova models, simulating the late phase neutrino observation in SK and focusing in particular on the identification of the last observed event. We discuss the possibility of model discrimination methods using timing information from this last observed event.

2025-05-26, **Occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversions in QCD phase-transition supernovae**, Zewei Xiong et.al., [2505.19592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19592v1)

 Core-collapse supernovae undergoing a first-order quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition experience the collapse of the central proto-neutron star that leads to a second bounce. This event is accompanied by the release of a second neutrino burst. Unlike the first stellar core bounce neutrino burst which consists exclusively of electron neutrinos, the second burst is dominated by electron antineutrinos. Such a condition makes QCD supernovae an ideal site for the occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC), which can lead to rapid flavor equilibration and significantly impact the related neutrino signal. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the conditions for fast flavor instability (FFI) around and after the second neutrino burst in a QCD phase transition supernova model launched from a 25~$M\_\odot$ progenitor mass. We evaluate the relevant instability criteria and find two major phases of FFC. The first phase is closely associated with the collapse and the rapidly expanding shock wave, which is a direct consequence of the proto-neutron star collapse due to the phase transition. The second phase takes place a few milliseconds later when electron degeneracy is restored near the proto-neutron star surface. We also characterize the growth rate of FFI and estimate its impact on the evolution of the neutrino flavor content. The potential observational consequences on neutrino signals are evaluated by comparing a scenario assuming complete flavor equipartition with other scenarios without FFC. Finally, we investigate how FFC may influences $r$-process nucleosynthesis associated with QCD phase transition driven supernova explosions.

2025-05-27, **Gravitational waves of quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries in an ultralight vector dark-matter environment**, Tomás Ferreira Chase et.al., [2505.21383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21383v1)

 The gravitational waves emitted by massive black hole binaries can be affected by a variety of environmental effects, which, if detected, could inform astrophysics and cosmology. We here study how gravitational waves emitted by black holes in quasi-circular orbits are affected by the presence of an ultra-light, vector-field, dark-matter environment that is minimally coupled to the binary. This dark-matter environment induces oscillatory gravitational potentials that perturb the orbit of the binary, leaving an imprint in the binary's binding energy, and thus, on the gravitational waves emitted. We here compute the effect of this environment on the gravitational-wave phase using the stationary-phase approximation within the post-Newtonian formalism. We then perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the detectability of this environmental effect with a four-year LISA observation, focusing on vector fields with ultra-light masses in the $(10^{-19}, 10^{-16}) \; \rm{eV}$ range. We conclude that the observation of such gravitational waves with space-borne interferometers, like LISA, could yield a measurement or constraint on local, vector dark-matter environments, provided the dark-matter density is larger than roughly $10^{14} \rm{M}\_\odot/{\rm{pc}}^3$.

2025-05-27, **Concurrent Exploration of Axion-Like Particle Interactions with Gauge Bosons at the LHC**, Shirin Chenarani et.al., [2505.21305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21305v1)

 Axion-like particles (ALPs) are pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken global symmetries incorporated in the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian in many models beyond the SM. The existence of a light ALP is plausible due to the long-standing problems that the SM has not been able to address, such as the dark matter (DM) problem and the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. There are many proposals in recent decades considering the ALP as a solution to some of these shortcomings. Motivated by such potential, we search for ALPs with a mass of 1 MeV at the LHC in a model-independent fashion. We explore two complementary production modes: ALP production in association with a pair of electroweak gauge bosons ($ZZ$ or $WW$) and ALP production in association with a single gauge boson ($W$ or $Z$) plus jets. For the $VV+a$ final state, signal and dominant SM backgrounds are generated, and a realistic detector response simulation is performed. A multivariate analysis is employed to discriminate the $VV+a$ signal from background processes, and the expected $95\%$ confidence level (CL) exclusion limits in two-dimensional parameter spaces involving the ALP couplings are subsequently derived. The $V$+jets channel is interpreted using LHC measurements in regimes where the ALP escapes detection, appearing as missing energy. The two analyses are complementary: both the $VV+a$ and the $V$+jets channels probe simultaneously the ALP couplings to gluons and to electroweak gauge bosons. While the $VV+a$ channel offers clean multi-lepton final states and direct reconstruction of the $ZZ$ or $WW$ system, the $V$+jets channel benefits from larger production cross sections, enabling stronger constraints in certain regions of the parameter space.

2025-05-27, **Prominent enhancement of axion thermalization rate from axion-kaon interactions**, Jin-Bao Wang et.al., [2505.21276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21276v1)

 The axion thermalization rate is a crucial input to determine the hot dark matter bound of axions, resulting from the scattering processes in the thermal bath of early Universe. We demonstrate that the commonly employed axion thermalization rate by including the $a\pi \leftrightarrow \pi\pi$ channel alone is significantly underestimated for the temperature $T$ above 100~MeV. This is obtained through the systematical calculation of the axion-light flavor meson scattering amplitudes within the framework of the chiral unitarization approach, paying special attention to the $a K \leftrightarrow \pi K$ reaction. Hadron resonances appearing in $a K \leftrightarrow \pi K$ amplitudes significantly enlarge the cross sections, which turn out to be much bigger than that of $a\pi \leftrightarrow\pi\pi$. The axion thermalization rate is then substantially enhanced by the $a K \leftrightarrow \pi K$ channel for $T\gtrsim 100$~MeV. Especially at $T\simeq 130$~MeV, the contribution from the $a K \leftrightarrow\pi K$ reaction to the axion thermalization rate exceeds the $a\pi\leftrightarrow\pi\pi$ one. Obviously more stringent constraints on the axion parameters are obtained, when confronting the number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N\_{\rm eff}$ from Planck$'$18.

2025-05-27, **Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star formation history profiles**, Heinrich Steigerwald et.al., [2505.21260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260v1)

 The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.

2025-05-27, **What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?**, Heinrich Steigerwald et.al., [2505.21256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21256v1)

 We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.

2025-05-27, **Transfer learning for multifidelity simulation-based inference in cosmology**, Alex A. Saoulis et.al., [2505.21215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21215v1)

 Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables cosmological parameter estimation when closed-form likelihoods or models are unavailable. However, SBI relies on machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning, combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.

2025-05-27, **Optimized quantum sensor networks for ultralight dark matter detection**, Adriel I. Santoso et.al., [2505.21188v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21188v1)

 Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most compelling unresolved problems in fundamental physics, motivating the search for new detection approaches. We propose a network-based quantum sensor architecture to enhance sensitivity to ultralight DM fields. Each node in the network is a superconducting qubit, interconnected via controlled-Z gates in symmetric topologies such as line, ring, star, and fully connected graphs. We investigate four- and nine-qubit systems, optimizing both state preparation and measurement using a variational quantum metrology framework. This approach minimizes the quantum and classical Cramer-Rao bounds to identify optimal configurations. Bayesian inference is employed to extract the DM-induced phase shift from measurement outcomes. Our results show that optimized network configurations significantly outperform conventional GHZ-based protocols while maintaining shallow circuit depths compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. Sensitivity remains robust under local dephasing noise. These findings highlight the importance of network structure in quantum sensing and point toward scalable strategies for quantum-enhanced DM detection.

2025-05-27, **Possible wormholes in generalized geometry-matter coupling gravity induced by the Dekel-Zhao dark matter profile**, A. Errehymy et.al., [2505.21081v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21081v1)

 In the late 1980s, Morris and Thorne led in theoretical physics by creating solutions to wormholes and formulating the crucial requirements for safe traversability of wormholes. They found that exotic matter must meet the requirement $P\_r + \rho < 0$, where $P\_r$ is radial pressure and $\rho$ is energy density. This is a rudimentary grasp of our understanding of general relativity. In this paper, we continue their excellent work by looking at how to build traversable wormhole solutions in an extended theory of gravity. We adopt a process of linearly modifying the matter Lagrangian and the energy-momentum tensor with some coupling strengths $\lambda$ and $\chi$. This may be considered as a special case of linear $f(R, T)$ gravity with matter coupling variability or as an additively separable simple $f(R, L\_m, T)$ model. We undertake a detailed analysis of static wormhole solutions with a constant redshift function. This allows us to present our results as a first-order approximation in the $f(R, L\_m, T)$ scenario. We derive the wormhole shape function from the Dekel-Zhao dark matter distribution in such a way that our solutions satisfy the needed conditions for traversability as well as the requirement of exotic matter. This is particularly exciting as it shows that wormholes in $f(R, L\_m, T)$ gravity can sustain both exotic as well as ordinary matter. To ensure that the shape function meets the requirement of flaring-out and is asymptotically flat, we place some constraints on the couplings. We also examine the gravitational lensing effects, which exhibit a repulsive gravitational force that appears in our extended gravity for positive couplings.

2025-05-27, **Scalarization and superradiant instability of black hole induced by dark matter halo in the scalar-tensor theory of gravity**, Junya Tanaka et.al., [2505.20919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20919v1)

 We investigate whether a black hole(BH) surrounded by a dark matter (DM) halo has scalar hair/superradiant instability in the scalar tensor theory of gravity. In the scalar tensor theory, the coupling of matter and the scalar field creates effective mass, this effective mass causes the hairless BH to have scalar hair (spontaneous Scalarization). In the case of rotating BHs, it is also known that if the sign of the effective mass is positive, superradiant instability can occur instead of scalarization. Our study applies this effect to BHs with dark matter haloes. As a result, we confirmed that scalarization and superradiant instability occur in some of the parameter regions. In the case of small haloes, the size and mass of the halo affect the strength of scalarization, but not for astronomically large haloes, where the dependence on the coupling constant $\alpha$ is stronger. In the case of superradiance, we also confirm that for small haloes, the size and mass of the halo affect the strength of the instability and the number of unstable modes.

2025-05-27, **Magnetically arrested transmutation of a compact star**, H. A. Adarsha et.al., [2505.20722v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20722v1)

 We introduce a novel mechanism -- Magnetically Arrested Transmutation (MAT) -- to account for the observed absence of ordinary pulsars near the Galactic centre, a longstanding puzzle known as the missing pulsar problem and the over-representation of magnetic white dwarfs in the same region. In this scenario, compact stars capture and accumulate dark matter, eventually forming an endoparasitic black hole (EBH) of initial mass $M\_0$ at their core. Although such EBHs generally grow by accreting host matter, we show that sufficiently strong core magnetic fields can establish pressure equilibrium, thereby stalling further accretion and halting the star's transmutation into a black hole. We derive the conditions for MAT to occur, identifying a critical parameter $\beta$, which encapsulates the interplay between the magnetic field strength, host matter density, and EBH mass. For $0 < \beta \leq 4/27$, the growth of the EBH is arrested, limiting its final mass ($M\_{\rm f}$) to $M\_0 < M\_{\rm f} \leq 3/2 M\_0$, whereas for $\beta > 4/27$, full transmutation may ensue. This framework offers a plausible unified explanation for the absence of ordinary pulsars and the survival of the magnetar PSR J1745-2900, and the elevated population of magnetic white dwarfs, in the Galactic centre, and hence could be tested and should have implications for understanding dark matter and compact objects.

2025-05-27, **Holographic superconductor with dark matter probed by entanglement entropy in higher dimensional AdS spacetime**, Weiping Yao et.al., [2505.20677v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20677v1)

 We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) with dark matter in a higher-dimensional AdS black hole spacetime including full back reaction, revealing its role as a diagnostic tool for critical phenomena in strongly coupled systems. By analyzing the HEE, we uncover distinct signatures of the metal/superconductor phase transition, demonstrating that the critical temperature is dynamically tuned by both the dark matter coupling strength and the chemical potential ratio between visible and dark matter sectors. Notably, near the criticality, the HEE exhibits a novel scaling behavior: it grows linearly with the dark matter coupling but displays a nonlinear, accelerated enhancement as the chemical potential ratio between the Maxwell and dark matter sectors increases.

2025-05-26, **Exploring the Structural Properties of Anisotropic Dark Matter-Admixed Quark Stars**, G. Panotopoulos et.al., [2505.20545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20545v1)

 We investigate anisotropic compact stars comprising two non-interacting fluids: quark matter and condensed dark matter. Using the MIT Bag model equation of state for quark matter and Bose-Einstein Condensate equation of state for dark matter, we numerically compute interior solutions for those two-fluid component spherical configurations. Varying the initial central density ratio of dark matter to quark matter, we examine how different proportions of these components influence the mass-radius profile, the factor of compactness as well as the quark mass fraction. Recent studies suggest that quark matter may exist in the cores of massive neutron stars, significantly affecting their structure and stability. We calculate the factor of compactness for both negative and positive anisotropy cases explored in this article. Our findings demonstrate that dark matter-admixed quark stars are more compact yet less massive compared to pure quark matter stars, aligning with recent theoretical predictions and gravitational wave observations.

2025-05-26, **Searching for Axion Dark Matter Near Relaxing Magnetars**, Sandip Roy et.al., [2505.20450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20450v1)

 Axion dark matter passing through the magnetospheres of magnetars can undergo hyper-efficient resonant mixing with low-energy photons, leading to the production of narrow spectral lines that could be detectable on Earth. Since this is a resonant process triggered by the spatial variation in the photon dispersion relation, the luminosity and spectral properties of the emission are highly sensitive to the charge and current densities permeating the magnetosphere. To date, a majority of the studies investigating this phenomenon have assumed a perfectly dipolar magnetic field structure with a near-field plasma distribution fixed to the minimal charge-separated force-free configuration. While this {may} be a reasonable treatment for the closed field lines of conventional radio pulsars, the strong magnetic fields around magnetars are believed to host processes that drive strong deviations from this minimal configuration. In this work, we study how realistic magnetar magnetospheres impact the electromagnetic emission produced from axion dark matter. Specifically, we construct charge and current distributions that are consistent with magnetar observations, and use these to recompute the prospective sensitivity of radio and sub-mm telescopes to axion dark matter. We demonstrate that the two leading models yield vastly different predictions for the frequency and amplitude of the spectral line, indicating systematic uncertainties in the plasma structure are significant. Finally, we discuss various observational signatures that can be used to differentiate the local plasma loading mechanism of an individual magnetar, which will be necessary if there is hope of using such objects to search for axions.

2025-05-26, **The role of unitarisation on dark-matter freeze-out via metastable bound states**, Kalliopi Petraki et.al., [2505.20443v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20443v1)

 In many Abelian and non-Abelian theories, standard calculations of radiative bound-state formation violate partial-wave unitarity - even at arbitrarily small couplings - when capture into excited states is considered. Recent work demonstrated that unitarity can be restored by the proper resummation of squared inelastic processes in the self-energy of the incoming state. We examine how unitarisation affects dark-matter thermal decoupling, given that the formation and decay of metastable dark-matter bound states are critical in determining the relic abundance, especially for multi-TeV dark matter. We consider an Abelian model featuring bound-state formation via emission of a light scalar that carries a conserved charge, whose dynamics also emulates relevant aspects of non-Abelian theories. Incorporating capture into excited states, we show that, without proper treatment, unitarity violation is so severe as to prevent freeze-out. Resumming the squared bound-state formation processes restores unitarity and ensures freeze-out, while capture into excited levels still significantly depletes dark matter. We further discuss the impact of higher partial waves, both within and beyond the present model. Finally, we point out the intriguing possibility of late dark-matter decoupling that can affect structure formation.

 We present the first joint analysis of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect with galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) for CMASS galaxies in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We show these complementary probes can disentangle baryons from dark matter in the outskirts of galactic halos by alleviating model degeneracies that are present when fitting to kSZ or GGL measurements alone. In our joint kSZ+GGL analysis we show that the baryon density profile is well constrained on scales from 0.3 to 50 Mpc/$h$. With our well constrained profile of the baryon density, we provide direct comparisons to simulations. For our model we find an outer slope of the baryon distribution that is shallower than predicted by some hydrodynamical simulations, consistent with enhanced baryonic feedback. We also show that not including baryons in a model for GGL can bias halo mass estimates low by $\sim 20\%$ compared to a model that includes baryons and is jointly fit to kSZ+GGL measurements. Our modelling code galaxy-galaxy lensing and kSZ (\texttt{glasz}) is publicly available at https://github.com/James11222/glasz.

2025-05-26, **Across the Universe: Dark Matter and Galaxy Cross-Correlations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory**, Elena Pinetti et.al., [2505.20383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20383v1)

 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will be a ground-based Cherenkov telescope performing wide-sky surveys, ideal for anisotropy studies such as cross-correlations with tracers of the cosmic large-scale structure. Cross-correlations can shed light on high-energy $\gamma$-ray sources and potentially reveal exotic signals from particle dark matter. In this work, we investigate CTAO sensitivity to cross-correlation signals between $\gamma$-ray emission and galaxy distributions. We find that by using dense, low-redshift catalogs like 2MASS, and for integration times around 50 hours, this technique achieves sensitivities to both annihilating and decaying dark matter signals that are competitive with those from dwarf galaxy and cluster analyses.

2025-05-26, **A frequentist view on the two-body decaying dark matter model**, Thomas Montandon et.al., [2505.20193v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20193v1)

 Decaying dark matter (DDM) has emerged as an interesting framework to extend the Lambda-cold-dark-matter (LCDM) model, as many particle physics models predict that dark matter may not be stable over cosmic time and can impact structure formation. In particular, a model in which DM decays at a rate $\Gamma$ and imprints a velocity kick $v$ onto its decay products leads to a low amplitude of fluctuations, as quantified by the parameter $S\_8$, in better agreement with that measured by some past weak lensing surveys. Bayesian analyses have provided mixed conclusions regarding its viability, with a reconstructed clustering amplitude only slightly below the standard LCDM value. In this paper, we perform a frequentist analysis of Planck+BAO data. We find $1\sigma$ constraints on the half-life of $6.93^{+7.88}\_{-2.85}$Gyr and a velocity kick of $1250^{+1450}\_{-1000}$km/s which differ from their Bayesian counterparts, indicating the presence of volume effects. Moreover, we find that under the DDM model, the frequentist analysis predicts lower values of $S\_8$, in agreement with those found by KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 at $1.5\sigma$. We further show that previously derived KiDS-1000 constraints that appeared to exclude the best-fit model from Planck data were driven by priors on the primordial parameters $A\_s$ and $n\_s$. When those are removed from the analysis, KiDS-1000 constraints on the DDM parameters are fully relaxed. It is only when applying Planck-informed priors on $A\_s$ and $n\_s$ to the KiDS-1000 analysis that one can constrain the model. We further highlight that in the absence of such priors, the region of scales best-measured by KiDS-1000 does not exactly match the $S\_8$ kernel, but rather a slightly smaller range of scales centered around $k\sim 0.3\, h/$Mpc. One must thus be careful in applying $S\_8$ constraints to a model instead of the full data likelihood.

2025-05-26, **On the detection of caustic crossing events associated with dark matter in the form of primordial black holes**, M. R. S. Hawkins et.al., [2505.20179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20179v1)

 The possibility that stellar mass primordial black holes may make up at least a significant fraction of dark matter has recently received much attention, partly as a result of gravitational wave observations, but more specifically from observations of microlensing in the Galactic halo and in quasar gravitational lens systems. If this is the case then a number of observable consequences are to be expected. This paper focusses on the prediction that dark matter in the form of primordial black holes will result in a web of caustics which when traversed by quasars will result in a complex but characteristic amplification of the accretion disc light source. Caustic crossings produce features in quasar light curves which are relatively straightforward to identify, and are hard to associate with any intrinsic mode of variation. Microlensing simulations are used to clarify the nature of the expected light curve features, and compared with observed light curves to demonstrate that caustic crossing features can be present. A further test of microlensing is based on the expected statistical symmetry of the light curves, which is not predicted for most models of intrinsic quasar variability, but is found in large samples of quasar light curves. The conclusion of the paper is that observations of quasar light curves are consistent with the expected microlensing amplifications from dark matter made up of stellar mass primordial black holes, but cannot easily be explained by intrinsic variations of the quasar accretion disc.

2025-05-26, **Shadows and Observational Images of a Schwarzschild-like Black Hole Surrounded by a Dehnen-type Dark Matter Halo**, Zuting Luo et.al., [2505.20115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20115v1)

 This study investigates the optical appearance of a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo, with a focus on how the DM halo's density $\rho\_{s}$ and radius $r\_{s}$ influence the BH's shadow and photon ring. First, the radius $r\_h$ of the BH's event horizon and the equation of motion for photons were derived, and observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for M87* were used to constrain the parameters $\rho\_{s}$ and $r\_{s}$ of the DM halo. Afterward, by varying the values of $\rho\_{s}$ and $r\_{s}$, key parameters such as the effective potential $V\_{eff}$ of photons, the critical impact parameter $b\_{ph}$, the radius $r\_{isco}$ of the innermost stable circular orbit,and the the radius $r\_{ph}$ of the photon sphere were calculated for each case. It was found that as $\rho\_{s}$ and $r\_{s}$ increase, the above mentioned parameters all show an increasing trend. Subsequently, we examined the optical appearance of the BH under two models: one with an optically and geometrically thin accretion disk and the other with a static spherical accretion model. The findings indicate that as $\rho\_{s}$ and $r\_{s}$ increase, the peak of the received intensity shifts toward a higher impact parameter $b$, resulting in a distinct optical appearance.

2025-05-26, **Classical Analysis of Noncoherent Dark Matter to Photon Conversions in a Resonant Cavity**, Puxian Wei et.al., [2505.20044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20044v1)

 Both axion and dark photon dark matter are among the most promising candidates of dark matter. What we know with some confidence is that they exhibit a small velocity distribution $\delta v\lesssim v\sim 10^{-3}$c. In addition, their mass is small, resulting in a long de Broglie wavelength and a high particle number density. Their phase space distribution has many uncertainties thus could give rise to a coherent or noncoherent wave on the laboratory scale. In this paper, we demonstrated that a resonant cavity can enhance the noncoherent axion-to-photon or dark photon-to-photon transitions. The reason in a classical picture is that a cavity can resonantly respond to many different resonant sources at the same time. This is consistent with the quantum perspective. The induced signals, however, are noncoherent and therefore may need a single-photon readout.

 In this letter, we present a novel analytical Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) solution that exhibits a static BH with a dark matter (DM) halo characterized by a Dehnen-type density profile. We study the properties of the newly derived BH solution by examining its spacetime curvature characteristics and energy conditions, providing insights into how the DM halo influences these fundamental characteristics. This solution could represent an alternative perspective on the interaction of black hole-dark matter systems, providing new insights into the fundamental properties of DM halos.

2025-05-26, **Probing Memory-Burdened Primordial Black Holes with Galactic Sources observed by LHAASO**, Xiu-hui Tan et.al., [2505.19857v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19857v1)

 The recently identified \textit{memory burden} effect has the potential to significantly decelerate the evaporation of black holes. Specifically, when approximately half of a black hole's initial mass has been radiated away, the evaporation process is halted. This mechanism allows very light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $m\_{\rm PBH}<10^{15}$ g to persist until the present day and may contribute to the dark matter (DM) content of the universe. In this work, we focus on PBHs with masses $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g. Due to the memory burden effect, these PBHs emit high-energy gamma-rays, which in turn alter the corresponding observed energy spectra. To investigate the constraints on the masses and DM abundance of PBHs, we analyze data from four Galactic sources measured by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), including the Crab Nebula, LHAASO J2226+6057, LHAASO J1908+0621, and LHAASO J1825-1326. Our findings indicate that the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray spectra from these Galactic sources provide crucial probes for light PBHs, thereby significantly constraining their potential contribution to DM.

2025-05-26, **Gravitational wave cosmology**, Ligong Bian et.al., [2505.19747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19747v1)

 Gravitational waves (GWs) originating from cosmological sources offer direct insights into the physics of the primordial Universe, the fundamental nature of gravity, and the cosmic expansion of the Universe. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive overview of our recent advances in GW cosmology, supported by the national key research and development program of China, focusing on cosmological GW sources and their implications for fundamental physics and cosmology. We first discuss the generation mechanisms and characteristics of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds generated by physical processes occurred in the early Universe, including those from inflation, phase transitions, and topological defects, and summarize current and possible future constraints from pulsar timing array and space-based detectors. Next, we explore the formation and observational prospects of primordial black holes as GW sources and their potential connection to dark matter. We then analyze how GWs are affected by large-scale structure, cosmological perturbations, and possible modifications of gravity on GW propagation, and how these effects can be used to test fundamental symmetry of gravity. Finally, we discuss the application of GW standard sirens in measuring the Hubble constant, the expansion history, and dark energy parameters, including their combination with electromagnetic observations. These topics together show how GW observations, especially with upcoming space-based detectors, such as LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin, can provide new information about the physics of the early Universe, cosmological evolution, and the nature of gravity.

2025-05-27, **Dust removal timescale in galaxies across cosmic time**, Aleksandra Leśniewska et.al., [2505.21492v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21492v1)

 Understanding the evolution of dust in galaxies is crucial because it affects the dynamics and cooling of gas, star formation, and chemical evolution. Recent work on dust removal in galaxies indicates timescales of gigayears, with old stellar populations and AGNs as the primary drivers of this process. However, most statistically significant studies are focused on low redshifts $z < 0.4$. Here, we determine the dust removal timescale in galaxies over a wide range of redshifts, up to $z \sim 5$. We use publicly available catalogue data of infrared-selected galaxies, observed by \textit{Herschel}. Using the inferred dust masses, stellar masses, and stellar ages, we calculate the dust removal timescale in a sample of more than 120,000 galaxies. We find that, with increasing redshift, the dust removal timescale decreases from 1.8 Gyr at redshift $z \sim 0.05$ to less than 500\,Myr at $z > 3$. Galaxies at higher redshifts undergo more efficient dust removal than galaxies at lower redshift, likely driven by AGN activity, supernova shocks, and astration. These findings indicate that dust removal evolves over cosmic time, reflecting the changing mechanisms regulating dust content of galaxies as the Universe evolves.

2025-05-27, **Teleparallel dark energy in a nonflat universe**, Rocco D'Agostino et.al., [2505.21359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21359v1)

 In this paper, we investigate the cosmological dynamics of teleparallel dark energy in the presence of nonzero spatial geometry. Extending previous analyses of nonminimal scalar-tensor theories in the torsion-based framework, we consider different scalar field potentials and examine the resulting background evolution and linear perturbations. Adopting a dynamical systems approach, we reformulate the field equations and constrain the model parameters via a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis combining updated datasets from Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, cosmic chronometers, and growth rate measurements. Our results suggest a mild preference for an open geometry, although all models remain consistent with a flat universe at the $1\sigma$ level. Notably, Bayesian information criteria indicate that the nonflat teleparallel scenario with a vanishing potential is strongly favored over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, all teleparallel scenarios are compatible with local determinations of the Hubble constant and exhibit better agreement with low-redshift structure formation data compared to $\Lambda$CDM. These findings highlight the potential of nonflat teleparallel gravity to address current observational tensions and motivate its further investigation as a viable alternative to standard cosmology.

2025-05-27, **Rapid binary mass transfer: Circumbinary outflows and angular momentum losses**, Peter Scherbak et.al., [2505.21264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21264v1)

 High rates of stable mass transfer likely occur for some binary star systems, but the resulting flow of mass and angular momentum (AM) is unclear. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a polytropic donor star and a point mass secondary to determine the mass, AM, and velocity of gas that escapes the system, and the dependence on binary parameters such as mass ratio. The simulations use an adiabatic equation of state and do not include any radiative cooling or irradiation of the outflow. Mass transfer is initiated by injecting heat into the stellar envelope, causing it to gradually inflate and overflow its Roche lobe. The transferred mass flows into an accretion disk, but soon begins to escape through the outer Lagrange point (L2), with a lesser amount escaping through the L3 point. This creates an equatorially concentrated circumbinary outflow with an opening angle of 10 to 30 degrees with a wind-like density profile $\rho \propto r^{-2}$. We find that the ratios of the specific AM of the outflowing gas over that of the L2 point are approximately {0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.65} for binary mass ratios $q$ (accretor/donor) of {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2}. The asymptotic radial velocity of the outflowing gas, in units of the binary orbital velocity, is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 for the same mass ratios, except for $q=0.25$ where it might be higher. This outflow, if ultimately unbound from the binary, may be a source of circumstellar material that will interact with ejecta from a subsequent supernova or stellar merger.

2025-05-27, **Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star formation history profiles**, Heinrich Steigerwald et.al., [2505.21260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260v1)

 The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.

2025-05-27, **What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?**, Heinrich Steigerwald et.al., [2505.21256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21256v1)

 We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.

2025-05-27, **A joint analysis of 3D clustering and galaxy \times CMB-lensing cross-correlations with DESI DR1 galaxies**, M. Maus et.al., [2505.20656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20656v1)

 The spectroscopic data from DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxies enables the analysis of 3D clustering by fitting galaxy power spectra and reconstructed correlation functions in redshift space. Given low measurements of the amplitude of structure from cosmic shear at $z\sim1$, redshift space distortions (RSD) + Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals from DESI galaxies combined with weak lensing can break degeneracies and provide a tight alternative constraint on the $z\sim1$ amplitude of structure. In this paper we perform joint analyses that combine full-shape + post-reconstruction information from the DESI DR1 BGS and LRG samples along with angular cross-correlations with Planck PR4 and ACT DR6 CMB lensing maps. We show that adding galaxy-lensing cross-correlations tightens clustering amplitude constraints, improving $\sigma\_8$ uncertainties by $\sim 40\%$ over RSD+BAO alone. We also include angular galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-lensing spectra using photometric samples from the DESI Legacy Survey to further improve constraints. Our headline results are $\sigma\_8 = 0.803\pm 0.017$, $\Omega\_{\rm m} = 0.3037\pm 0.0069$, and $S\_8 = 0.808\pm 0.017$. Given DESI's preference for higher $\sigma\_8$ compared to lower values from BOSS, we perform a catalog-level comparison of LRG samples from both surveys. We test sensitivity to dark energy assumptions by relaxing our $\Lambda$CDM prior and allowing for evolving dark energy via the $w\_0-w\_a$ parameterization. We find our $S\_8$ constraints to be relatively unchanged despite a $~3.5\sigma$ tension with the cosmological constant model when combining with the Union3 supernova likelihood. Finally we test general relativity (GR) by allowing the gravitational slip parameter ($\gamma$) to vary, and find $\gamma = 1.17\pm0.11$ in mild ($\sim1.5\sigma$) tension with the GR value of $1.0$.

2025-05-27, **Photometric and Spectroscopic Studies of Two Early-Type Eclipsing Binaries**, Peng-Fei Ye et.al., [2505.20592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20592v1)

 Using high-precision photometric data from TESS, medium resolution spectroscopic data from LAMOST, and long-term eclipse timings, we provide orbital parameters for two early-type detached eclipsing binary systems: TYC 3740-2072-1 and TYC 2888-780-1, and analyze the orbital period variations and evolutionary status of these two targets. TYC 3740-2072-1, with a spectral type of B1V, consists of a $6.914 M\_\odot$ subgiant and a $6.233 M\_\odot$ main-sequence component. It is expected to evolve into a semi-detached binary, potentially serving as a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova. TYC 2888-780-1 has a spectral type of A3 and consists of two main-sequence components with masses of $1.682 M\_\odot$ and $1.673 M\_\odot$, respectively. It is undergoing stable evolution. Through eclipse timing analysis, we find that both targets exhibit apsidal motion effects, with observed AM rates of $\dot{\omega}\_{obs} = 0.0412~\text{deg}~\text{cycle}^{-1}$ and $\dot{\omega}\_{obs} = 0.0205~\text{deg}~\text{cycle}^{-1}$, respectively. Additionally, TYC 2888-780-1 exhibits orbital period variations, which we attribute to the light travel time effect caused by a third body, the minimum mass of this third body is estimated to be $0.598 M\_\odot$.

2025-05-26, **SN 2024aecx: A double-peaked rapidly evolving Type IIb supernova at 11 Mpc**, Xingzhu Zou et.al., [2505.19831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19831v1)

 We present the results of low-resolution spectroscopic and densely sampled multiband simultaneous optical imaging ($ugi$ and $vrz$ bands) follow-up of supernova (SN) 2024aecx. The photometric data is supplemented with $Swift$/UVOT and ATLAS survey observations. The SN was discovered in the spiral galaxy NGC 3521 (distance $\sim$11 Mpc) within a day after the explosion. The early spectra of SN 2024aecx show a weak signature of hydrogen lines, which disappeared in $\sim$30 days after the explosion. Light curves in all bands show a distinct feature of two peaks, and the first peak is likely due to the shock cooling emission. The early phase light curve evolution of SN 2024aecx has similarity with the typical Type IIb events, but the decay rate in different bands (e.g., $\rm \Delta m\_{15}$ = 1.60 $\pm$ 0.05 mag, $g$-band) is significantly faster in the post-peak phase. It attained the secondary maximum in $\sim$19 days ($g$-band) with a peak absolute magnitude of M$\_{g}$= -17.94 $\pm$ 0.10 mag. The color evolution of SN 2024aecx is displaying a red-blue-red trend between days $\sim$8 to 40. The analytical model fitting to the light curves reveals an envelope mass and progenitor radii in the range of $\sim$0.03 - 0.24 $M\_\odot$ and $\sim$169 - 200 $R\_\odot$, respectively. Modeling of the pseudo-bolometric light curve suggests that synthesized $^{56}$Ni in the explosion was $\sim$0.15 M$\_{\odot}$ with ejecta mass and kinetic energy of $\sim$0.7 M$\_{\odot}$ and $\sim$0.16 x 10$^{51}$ erg, respectively. The observational properties and modeling indicate that the SN 2024aecx progenitor belongs to the extended progenitor category.

2025-05-26, **Infrared diagnostics of late-time core-collapse supernova spectra**, Luc Dessart et.al., [2505.19818v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19818v1)

 Nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations of red-supergiant and He-star explosions are presented, extending previous work to focus on the infrared emission from atoms and ions in the ejecta during the nebular-phase (i.e., ~200 to ~500d) -- molecules and dust are ignored. We cover non-rotating, solar-metallicity progenitors spanning an initial mass between 10 and about 40Msun, and exploding as Type II or Ibc supernovae (SNe). Both photometrically and spectroscopically, the SN II models evolve distinctly from the SN Ibc models, primarily because of the greater ejecta kinetic-energy-to-mass ratio in the latter, which leads to a greater gamma-ray escape together with a lower density and a higher ionization in our H-deficient ejecta. Type II SN models remain optically luminous at all times, whereas SN Ibc models progressively brighten in the infrared (which holds 80% of their luminosity at 500d), causing strong infrared lines such as [NeII]12.81mic or [NiII]6.634mic to evolve essentially at constant luminosity. We find that the strength of [NeII]12.81mic correlates with progenitor mass but with additional strong sensitivity to, for example, ejecta ionization -- this line radiates alone up to 20% of the SN luminosity after ~300d in our SN Ibc models. The numerous infrared Ni lines are found to be good tracers of the material that underwent explosive nucleosynthesis and can thus be used to constrain the level of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SNe. The evolution of the integrated flux in infrared Fe and Co lines shows much diversity, which compromises their use as diagnostic of the 56Ni-decay power source in our models. Future spectroscopic observations of core-collapse SNe by the JWST will provide unprecedented information on the emission from atoms and ions in their ejecta, delivering critical constraints on the inner workings of massive star explosions.
