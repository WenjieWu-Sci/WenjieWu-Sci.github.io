2023-06-12, **Rapid Analysis of $\mathrm{^{226}Ra}$ in Ultrapure Gadolinium Sulfate Octahydrate**, Y. Sakakieda et.al., [2306.06926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06926v1)

 Numerous particle physics experiments utilize gadolinium (Gd), a rare earth element with the most significant neutron capture cross-section among all elements, to detect anti-neutrinos via inverse beta-decays or to remove neutron-induced background events. For example, to load Gd into water Cherenkov detectors, $\mathrm{{Gd\_{2}(SO\_{4})\_{3}\cdot 8H\_{2}O}}$ is dissolved and rare event search experiments are required to screen for radioactive impurities in $\mathrm{{Gd\_{2}(SO\_{4})\_{3}\cdot 8H\_{2}O}}$ before dissolution. This study developed a new method to rapidly measure the radium-226($\mathrm{^{226}Ra}$) concentration in $\mathrm{{Gd\_{2}(SO\_{4})\_{3}\cdot 8H\_{2}O}}$. This method requires only three days to measure a batch of samples, as opposed to the usual method using high-purity germanium detectors, which takes approximately 20 days after arrival. The detection limit for the measurement of $\mathrm{^{226}Ra}$ is 0.32 mBq/kg. This method has been already used for $\mathrm{{Gd\_{2}(SO\_{4})\_{3}\cdot 8H\_{2}O}}$ screening at the Super-Kamiokande Gd(SK-Gd) project, and it can be applied to future experiments.

2023-06-12, **Probing top quark anomalous moments in $W$ boson associated single top quark production at the LHC using polarization and spin correlation**, Rafiqul Rahaman et.al., [2306.06889v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06889v1)

 We study the $W$ boson associated single top quark production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to probe anomalous chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric moments of the top quark with the help of polarization and spin correlation observables besides the cross-section in the leptonic final state. We reconstruct the two neutrinos in the final state using the $M\_{T2}$ assisted on-shell (MAOS) reconstruction method to measure the polarization and spin correlation asymmetries of the top quark and the $W$ boson. We estimate the limits on the anomalous moments in a detector-level simulation considering possible backgrounds for a few sets of integrated luminosities and examined the effect of systematic uncertainties.

2023-06-12, **New method to revisit the gravitational lensing analysis of the Bullet Cluster using radio waves**, Youngsub Yoon et.al., [2306.07157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07157v1)

 Gravitational lensing studies of the Bullet Cluster suggested convincingly in favor of the existence of dark matter. However, it was performed without the knowledge of the original orientation of each galaxy before gravitational lensing. A potential improvement to this issue lies in the measurement of the original orientation from the polarization direction of radio waves emitted from each galaxy. In this context, Francfort et al. derived a formula that can utilize the information about the original orientation of each galaxy to obtain what is called ${\it shear}$. However, we demonstrate that shear in their formula should be replaced by ${\it reduced~shear}$ when the change in sizes of images of galaxies is taken into account. As the previous gravitational lensing analysis of the Bullet Cluster used reduced shear, we suggest applying our improved formula directly for the reanalysis once we obtain the polarization direction of radio waves. In particular, we show that our new formula can yield a more accurate analysis than the previous one, if the polarization direction can be measured more precisely than $10^\circ$.

2023-06-12, **CP-violating axion interactions II: axions as Dark Matter**, Vaisakh Plakkot et.al., [2306.07065v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07065v1)

 Axions provide a solution to the strong CP problem and are excellent dark matter candidates. The presence of additional sources of CP violation, for example to account for the matter/antimatter asymmetry of the universe, can lead to CP-violating interactions between axions and Standard Model fields. In case axions form a coherent dark matter background, this leads to time-oscillating fundamental constants such as the fine-structure constant and particle masses. In this work we compare the sensitivity of various searches for CP-odd axion interactions. These include fifth-force experiments, searches for time-oscillating constants induced by axion dark matter, and direct limits from electric dipole moment experiments. We show that searches for oscillating constants can outperform fifth-force experiments in the regime of small axion masses, but, in general, do not reach the sensitivity of electric dipole moment experiments.

2023-06-12, **Electron and Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM**, Junjie Cao et.al., [2306.06854v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06854v1)

 Inspired by the recent measurements of the muon and electron anomalous magnetic moments, the rapid progress of the LHC search for supersymmetry, and the significantly improved sensitivities of dark matter direct detection experiments, we studied the supersymmetric contribution to the electron \texorpdfstring{$g-2$}{}, $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}$, in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with a discrete $\mathbb{Z}\_3$ symmetry. We concluded that $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}$ was mainly correlated with $a\_\mu^{\rm SUSY}$ by the formula $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}/m\_e^2 \simeq a\_\mu^{\rm SUSY}/m\_\mu^2$, and significant violations of this correlation might occur only in rare cases. As a result, $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}$ was typically around $5 \times 10^{-14}$ when $a\_\mu^{\rm SUSY} \simeq 2.5 \times 10^{-9}$. We also concluded that the dark matter direct detection and LHC experiments played crucial roles in determining the maximum reach of $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}$. Concretely, $a\_e^{\rm SUSY}$ might be around $3 \times 10^{-13}$ in the optimum cases if one used the XENON-1T experiment to limit the supersymmetry parameter space. This prediction, however, was reduced to $1.5 \times 10^{-13}$ after implementing the LZ restrictions and $1.0 \times 10^{-13}$ when further considering the LHC restrictions.

2023-06-11, **Probe the equation of state for neutron stars with captured primordial black holes inside**, Qing Gao et.al., [2306.06645v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06645v1)

 Primordial black holes generated in the early universe are considered as a candidate for dark matter. The scenario where neutron stars capture primordial black holes gives rise to a series of observable consequences, allowing neutron stars to play the role of dark matter detectors. Gravitational waves from primordial black holes inspiralling inside neutron stars are detectable for ground-based detectors, providing a unique insight into the neutron star structure. We generate gravitational wave templates for such systems with different equations of state of neutron stars by solving the Einstein equations inside neutron stars, and taking the dynamical friction, accretion, and gravitational radiation into account. We find that Einstein Telescope can distinguish the equation of state of neutron stars by detecting gravitational waves from primordial black holes inspiralling inside neutron stars within the Milky Way galaxy.

2023-06-11, **Improved model of primordial black hole formation after Starobinsky inflation**, Sultan Saburov et.al., [2306.06597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06597v1)

 The new (improved) model of inflation and primordial black hole (PBH) formation is proposed by combining the Starobinsky model of inflation, the Appleby-Battye-Starobinsky (ABS) model of dark energy and a quantum correction in the framework of modified $F(R)$ gravity. The energy scale parameter in the ABS model is taken to be close to the inflationary scale, in order to describe double inflation instead of dark energy. The quantum correction is given by the term quartic in the spacetime scalar curvature $R$ with a negative coefficient $\delta$ in the $F(R)$ function. It is demonstrated that perfect (within $1\sigma$) agreement with current measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation can be achieved by choosing the proper value of $\delta$, thus solving the problem of low values of the tilt of CMB scalar perturbations in the earlier proposed model in arXiv:2205.00603. A large enhancement (large peak) in the power spectrum of scalar perturbations is achieved by fine-tuning the parameters of the model. It is found by numerical analysis that it leads to a formation of asteroid-size PBH with the masses up to $10^{20}$ g, which may form dark matter in the current universe.

2023-06-12, **Nebular spectra from Type Ia supernova explosion models compared to JWST observations of SN 2021aefx**, St√©phane Blondin et.al., [2306.07116v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07116v1)

 Recent JWST observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2021aefx in the nebular phase have paved the way for late-time studies covering the full optical to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength range, and with it the hope to better constrain SN Ia explosion mechanisms. We investigate whether public SN Ia models covering a broad range of progenitor scenarios and explosion mechanisms can reproduce the full optical-MIR spectrum of SN 2021aefx at $\sim$270 days post explosion. We perform 1D steady-state non-LTE simulations with the radiative-transfer code CMFGEN, and compare the predicted spectra to SN 2021aefx. The models can explain the main features of SN 2021aefx over the full wavelength range. However, no single model, or mechanism, emerges as a preferred match. We discuss possible causes for the mismatch of the models, including ejecta asymmetries and ionisation effects. Our new calculations of the collisional strengths for Ni III have a major impact on the two prominent lines at 7.35 and 11.00 $\mu$m, and highlight the need for more accurate collisional data for forbidden transitions. Using updated atomic data, we identify a strong feature due to [Ca IV] 3.21 $\mu$m, attributed to [Ni I] in previous studies. We also provide a tentative identification of a forbidden line due to [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m, whose peaked profile suggests that neon is mixed inwards during the explosion, as predicted for instance in violent merger models. Contrary to previous claims, we show that the [Ar III] 8.99 $\mu$m line can be broader in sub-$M\_\mathrm{Ch}$ models compared to near-$M\_\mathrm{Ch}$ models. Our models suggest that key physical ingredients are missing from either the explosion models, or the radiative-transfer post-processing, or both. Nonetheless, they also show the potential of the near- and mid-infrared to uncover new spectroscopic diagnostics of SN Ia explosion mechanisms. [Abridged]

2023-06-12, **Double neutron star formation via consecutive type II supernova explosions**, Vikt√≥ria Fr√∂hlich et.al., [2306.07099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07099v1)

 Since the discovery of the first double neutron star (DNS) system, the number of these exotic binaries has reached fifteen. Here we investigate a channel of DNS formation in binary systems with components above the mass limit of type II supernova explosion (SN II), i.e. 8 MSun. We apply a spherically symmetric homologous envelope expansion model to account for mass loss, and follow the dynamical evolution of the system numerically with a high-precision integrator. The first SN occurs in a binary system whose orbital parameters are pre-defined, then, the homologous expansion model is applied again in the newly formed system. Analysing 1 658 880 models we find that DNS formation via subsequent SN II explosions requires a fine-tuning of the initial parameters. Our model can explain DNS systems with a separation greater than 2.95 au. The eccentricity of the DNS systems spans a wide range thanks to the orbital circularisation effect due to the second SN II explosion. The eccentricity of the DNS is sensitive to the initial eccentricity of the binary progenitor and the orbital position of the system preceding the second explosion. In agreement with the majority of the observations of DNS systems, we find the system centre-of mass velocities to be less than 60 km/s. Neutron stars that become unbound in either explosion gain a peculiar velocity in the range of 0.02 - 240 km/s. In our model, the formation of tight DNS systems requires a post-explosion orbit-shrinking mechanism, possibly driven by the ejected envelopes.

2023-06-12, **On the occurrence of stellar fission in binary-driven hypernovae**, S. R. Zhang et.al., [2306.07097v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07097v1)

 The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model address long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated with type Ic supernovae (SNe) through a series of physical episodes that occur in a binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star (of mass about 10 solar mass) and a neutron star (NS) companion (of mass about 2 solar mass) in a compact orbit. The SN explosion of the CO star triggers sequence of seven events. The BdHN model has followed the traditional picture of the SN from the CO iron's core collapse. However, the lack of a solution to the problem of producing successful SNe leaves room for alternative scenarios. We here show that tidal synchronization of the CO-NS binary can lead the CO star to critical conditions for fission, hence splitting into two stellar remnants, e.g., about 8.5 solar mass + 1.5 solar mass. We give specific examples of the properties of the products for various orbital periods relevant to BdHNe. The astrophysical consequences of this scenario are outlined.

2023-06-12, **Transition from small-scale to large-scale dynamo in a supernova-driven, multiphase medium**, Frederick A. Gent et.al., [2306.07051v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07051v1)

 Magnetic fields are now widely recognised as critical at many scales to galactic dynamics and structure, including multiphase pressure balance, dust processing, and star formation. Models that impose galactic magnetic fields cannot reliably capture their dynamical structure nor interactions with phases within the interstellar medium (ISM). Dynamos must be modelled to create such magnetic fields. ISM models exist in which a small-scale dynamo (SSD) drives a turbulent magnetic field. Others model the large-scale dynamo (LSD) with magnetic field organised at the scale of the disc or spiral arms. Separately, neither can fully describe the dynamics of galactic magnetic fields nor represent their topology. We model the LSD and SSD together at high enough resolution to use explicit Lagrangian resistivity and viscosity. The galactic SSD saturates in less than 20 Myr. We show that the SSD is quite insensitive to the presence of an LSD and is even stronger in the presence of a large-scale shear flow. The LSD grows more slowly in the presence of SSD, saturating after 5 Gyr vs. 1--2 Gyr in studies where the SSD is weak or absent. The LSD primarily grows in warm gas in the galactic midplane. Saturation of the LSD occurs due to ${\alpha}$-quenching near the midplane as the growing mean field produces a magnetic ${\alpha}$ that opposes the kinetic ${\alpha}$. The magnetic energy in our models of the LSD shows slightly sublinear response to increasing resolution, indicating that we are converging towards the physical solution at 1 pc resolution. Including clustered supernovae from OB associations increases the rate of growth of both the SSD and the LSD compared to a horizontally uniform distribution.
