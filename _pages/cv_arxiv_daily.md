2023-05-04, **Dark matter from sterile-sterile neutrino mixing**, Pasquale Di Bari et.al., [2305.03032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03032v1)

 A solution to the problem of the origin of matter in the universe can be reasonably searched within extensions of the standard model that also explain neutrino masses and mixing. Models embedding the minimal seesaw mechanism can explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis and dark matter via active-sterile neutrino mixing. In this case a keV lightest seesaw neutrino would play the role of warm dark matter particle. This traditional solution is now constrained by various cosmological observations. I will discuss the possibility that a much heavier but yet metastable (dark) right-handed neutrino with mass in the $1\,{\rm TeV}$--$1 \, {\rm PeV}$ range can play the role of (cold) dark matter particle. The right abundance would be produced by the Higgs induced mixing with a seesaw right-handed neutrino (RHINO model), i.e., by sterile-sterile neutrino mixing. Such a mixing would necessarily require a further extension of the minimal seesaw mechanism and can be described by a dimension-five effective operator. The same mixing would also necessarily induce dark neutrino instability with lifetimes that can be much longer than the age of the universe and can escape current constraints from neutrino telescopes. On the other hand, a contribution to very high energy neutrino flux produced by dark neutrino decays could explain an anomalous excess at 100 TeV energies confirmed recently by the IceCube collaboration. I will also discuss a simple UV completion where the mediator is given by a massive fermion. Intriguingly, it comes out that the favoured scale of new physics for RHINO to satisfy the dark matter requirements coincides with the grand-unified scale: a RHINO miracle.

2023-05-04, **Untying the growth index to relief the $σ_8$ discomfort**, Ziad Sakr et.al., [2305.02863v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02863v1)

 The fluctuation of matter parameter $\sigma\_8$ is by model construction degenerate with the growth index $\gamma$. Here we try to study the effect on the cosmological parameters constraints from treating each independently by considering $\sigma\_8$ as a free and not derived parameter along with $\gamma$, to then try to constrain all by three probes, namely the CMB spectrum, the growth measurements from redshift space distortions $f\sigma\_8$ and the galaxy cluster counts. We also want to asses the impact of this relaxation on the $\sigma\_8$ tension. We also propose a more sophisticated correction, along with the classical one that takes into account the impact of cosmology on the growth measurements, which is to adjust the growth to keep the observed power spectrum invariant with the background evolution. We found that untying the two parameters does not shift the maximum likelihood on either $\sigma\_8$ or $\gamma$ but rather allow for larger bounds with respect to when $\sigma\_8$ is a derived parameter. More precisely, we obtain $\sigma\_8 = 0.809\pm 0.043 $ and $\gamma = 0.613\pm 0.046$ in agreement with Planck constraints for the former and compatible with $\Lambda$CDM for the latter but with bounds enough wide to accomodate both values subject of tensions for $\sigma\_8$. On the other hand, considering a tier correction yields $\sigma\_8 = 0.734\pm 0.013$ close to the local values albeit with a growth index $\gamma = 0.636\pm 0.022$ while allowing a massive neutrinos yielded $\sigma\_8 = 0.756\pm 0.024$, still preferring low values but with looser constraints, with $\gamma = 0.549\pm 0.048$ and a slight preference for $\Sigma m\_\nu \sim 0.19$ value. We conclude that untying $\sigma\_8$ and $\gamma$ helps in relieving the discomfort on the former between CMB and local probes and that careful analyse should be followed when using data obtained in a model dependent way.(abridged)

2023-05-04, **Two-component vector WIMP, fermion FIMP dark matter model with an extended seesaw mechanism**, Francesco Costa et.al., [2305.02851v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02851v1)

 The document discusses a proposed extension to the Standard Model that aims to explain the presence of neutrino masses and the existence of dark matter. The model includes two potential candidates for dark matter, a vector WIMP and a fermion FIMP, and their combined presence accounts for the total amount of observed dark matter. This study examines the various ways in which dark matter could be produced within this model and explores the connections between the dark matter and neutrino sectors. It also examines various constraints from existing and future experiments. Additionally, the model includes a scalar field that can play a role in a first-order phase transition in the early universe, and the article looks at the potential for the production of gravitational waves as a result of this phase transition and their detectability. This study also assesses the possibility for this phase transition to be strong enough to drive the electroweak baryogenesis.

2023-05-04, **Evidence for Large Scale, Rapid Gas Inflows in z~2 Star Forming Disks**, R. Genzel et.al., [2305.02959v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02959v1)

 We report high quality H${\alpha}$/CO, imaging spectroscopy of nine massive, disk galaxies on the star forming, Main Sequence (henceforth 'SFGs'), near the peak of cosmic galaxy evolution (z~1.1-2.5), taken with the ESO-VLT, IRAM-NOEMA and ALMA. We fit the major axis position-velocity cuts with beam-convolved, forward models with a bulge, a turbulent rotating disk, and a dark matter (DM) halo. We include priors for stellar and molecular gas masses, optical light effective radii and inclinations, and DM masses from our previous rotation curve analyses of these galaxies. We then subtract the inferred 2D model-galaxy velocity and velocity dispersion maps from those of the observed galaxies. We investigate whether the residual velocity and velocity dispersion maps show indications for radial flows. We also carry out kinemetry, a model-independent tool for detecting radial flows. We find that all nine galaxies exhibit significant non-tangential flows. In six SFG, the inflow velocities ($v\_r$~30-90 km s$^{-1}$, 10-30% of the rotational component) are along the minor axis of these galaxies. In two cases the inflow appears to be off the minor axis. The magnitudes of the radial motions are in broad agreement with the expectations from analytic models of gravitationally unstable, gas rich disks. Gravitational torques due to clump and bar formation, or spiral arms, drive gas rapidly inward and result in the formation of central disks and large bulges. If this interpretation is correct, our observations imply that gas is transported into the central regions on ~10 dynamical time scales.

2023-05-04, **The FLUKA cross sections for cosmic-ray leptons and uncertainties on current positron predictions**, Pedro De la Torre Luque et.al., [2305.02958v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02958v1)

 Cosmic-ray (CR) antiparticles have the potential to reveal signatures of unexpected astrophysical processes and even new physics beyond the Standard Model. Recent CR detectors have provided accurate measurements of the positron flux, revealing the so-called positron excess at high energies. However, the uncertainties related to the modelling of the local positron flux are still very high, significantly affecting our models of positron emission from pulsars and current dark matter searches.   In this work, we report a new set of cross sections for positron and electron production derived from the {\tt FLUKA} code. We compare them with the most extended cross-section data-sets and show the impact of neglecting the positron production from heavy CRs. Then, we review the most significant sources of uncertainties in our current estimations of the secondary positron flux at Earth and examine for the first time the impact of considering the spiral arm structure of the Galaxy in these estimations. Finally, we provide state-of-the-art predictions of the local positron flux and discuss the limitations of our dark matter searches with positrons and difficulties to determine the contribution from pulsars to the positron flux at low energies.

2023-05-04, **Gravitational Lensing of Gravitational Waves: Probing Intermediate Mass Black Holes in Galaxy Lenses with Global Minima**, Ashish Kumar Meena et.al., [2305.02880v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02880v1)

 In this work, we study microlensing effects in strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) signals corresponding to global minima in galaxy-scale lenses. We find that stellar microlenses alone are unable to introduce noticeable wave effects in the global minima GW signals at strong lensing magnification $(\mu)<50$ with match value between unlensed and lensed GW signals being above ${\sim}99.5\%$ in ${\sim}90\%$ of systems. Since the stellar microlenses introduce negligible wave effects in global minima, they can be used to probe the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) lenses in the galaxy lens. We show that the presence of an IMBH lens with mass in the range $[50,10^3]~{\rm M\_\odot}$ such that the global minima lies within five Einstein radius of it, the microlensing effects at $f<10^2$ Hz are mainly determined by the IMBH lens for $\mu<50$. Assuming that a typical strong lensing magnification of 3.8 and high enough signal-to-noise ratio (in the range $\sim[10, 30]$) to detect the microlensing effect in GW signals corresponding to global minima, with non-detection of microlensing effects in ${\sim}15 ({\sim}150)$ lensed GW signals, we can rule out dark matter fraction $>10\% (>1\%)$ made of IMBH population inside galaxy lenses in mass range $[50, 10^3] {\rm M\_\odot}$ with ${\sim}$90\% confidence.

2023-05-04, **Probing Dark Matter via Effective Field Theory Approach**, Ayşe Elçiboğa Kuday et.al., [2305.02592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02592v1)

 We analyse dark matter in most general form of effective field theory approach. To examine the interactions between weakly interacting massive particles(WIMPs) and Standard Model (SM) particles, we use the six-dimensional EFT mediated by new physics scale $\Lambda$ at tree level. After implementing a new effective field theory model in FeynRules \cite{Feynrules} We investigate the theory and constrain the theory by using relic density generated by MadDM\cite{Maddm} tool of MadGraph5\\_aMC@NLO \cite{mg5}.

2023-05-04, **Gravitational freeze-in dark matter from Higgs Preheating**, Ruopeng Zhang et.al., [2305.02568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02568v1)

 Gravitational freeze-in is a mechanism to explain the observed dark matter relic density if dark matter neither couples to inflation nor to standard model sector. In this work, we study gravitational freeze-in dark matter production during Higgs preheating based on non-perturbative resonance. Using reliable lattice method to handle this non-perturbative process, we show that tachyonic resonance is prohibited by strong back reaction due to Higgs self interaction needed to keep the positivity of potential during preheating, and parameter resonance is viable by tuning the Higgs self-interaction coupling to be small enough in ultraviolet energy scale. We then derive the dark matter relic density under the context of Higgs preheating, and uncover a new dark matter parameter space with dark matter mass larger than inflaton mass, which arises from out-of-equilium Higgs annihilation. Finally, we briefly remark the open question of testing gravitational dark matter.

2023-05-04, **SuperNOVA: Design Strategies and Opportunities for Interactive Visualization in Computational Notebooks**, Zijie J. Wang et.al., [2305.03039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03039v1)

 Computational notebooks such as Jupyter Notebook have become data scientists' de facto programming environments. Many visualization researchers and practitioners have developed interactive visualization tools that support notebooks. However, little is known about the appropriate design of visual analytics (VA) tools in notebooks. To bridge this critical research gap, we investigate the design strategies in this space by analyzing 159 notebook VA tools and their users' feedback. Our analysis encompasses 62 systems from academic papers and 103 systems sourced from a pool of 55k notebooks containing interactive visualizations that we obtain via scraping 8.6 million notebooks on GitHub. We also examine findings from 15 user studies and user feedback in 379 GitHub issues. Through this work, we identify unique design opportunities and considerations for future notebook VA tools, such as using and manipulating multimodal data in notebooks as well as balancing the degree of visualization-notebook integration. Finally, we develop SuperNOVA, an open-source interactive tool to help researchers explore existing notebook VA tools and search for related work.

2023-05-04, **One matter density discrepancy to alleviate them all or further trouble for $Λ$CDM model**, Ziad Sakr et.al., [2305.02846v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02846v1)

 We investigate whether the two cosmological discrepancies on the Hubble constant ($H\_0$) and the matter fluctuation parameter ($\sigma\_8$) could be traded by only one on the present value of the matter density ($\Omega\_{\rm{M}}$). We combined different probes in an agnostic approach by, either relaxing the calibration parameters in each probe in order to be set by the data, or by only including priors with the condition that they are obtained independently from the discrepant parameters. We also compiled and used a dataset from previous direct measurements of $\Omega\_{\rm{M}}$. We found when combining, as our baseline, galaxy clusters counts + cluster baryon fraction probe + cosmic chronometers + direct $\Omega\_{\rm{M}}$ + priors from BBN and CMB, that both parameters, $H\_0$ and $\sigma\_8$, are consistent with those inferred with local probes, with $\sigma\_8 = 0.745 \pm 0.05$ while $H\_0 = 73.8 \pm 3.01$, and that for a value of $\Omega\_{\rm{M}} = 0.22 \pm 0.01$ at more than 3$\sigma$ from that usually determined by CMB. We also found similar preferences when replacing cosmic chronometers (CC) by the Supernovae (SN) data while allowing its calibration parameter to vary. However discrepancies appeared when we combined SN in addition to CC suggesting either inconsistencies between the SN sample and the other probes used or a serious challenge to our hypothesis. We conclude that, either reconciling both tensions requires local inferred values of matter density at odd with those obtained by CMB, reviving by then an overlooked discrepancy, or simply that further evidences are indicating that $\Lambda$CDM model is facing more difficulties to accommodate simultaneously all the current available observations.(abridged)

2023-05-04, **Tracing Pop III supernovae with extreme energies through the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy**, Ása Skúladóttir et.al., [2305.02829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02829v1)

 The Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is old and metal-poor, making it ideal to study the earliest chemical enrichment in the Local Group. We followed up the most metal-poor star known in this (or any external) galaxy, AS0039, with high-resolution ESO VLT/UVES spectra. Our new analysis confirmed its low metallicity, [Fe/H]=-3.90, and that it is extremely C-poor, with A(C)=+3.60, which corresponds to [C/Fe]=-0.33 (accounting for internal mixing). This adds to the evidence of Sculptor being intrinsically C-poor at low [Fe/H]. However, here we also report a new discovery of a carbon-enhanced metal-poor star in Sculptor, DR20080, with no enhancement of Ba (CEMP-no), indicative of enrichment by zero-metallicity low-energy supernovae. This is the first evidence of a dual population of CEMP-no and C-normal stars in Sculptor at $\rm[Fe/H]\leq{-3}$. The fraction of CEMP-no stars is still low, $9^{+11}\_{-8}\%$ at $\rm -4\leq[Fe/H]\leq-3$, compared to the significantly higher fraction in the Milky Way halo, $\approx40\%$. In addition, we re-derive chemical abundances of light, $\alpha$-, iron peak, and neutron-capture elements in all Sculptor stars at $\rm [Fe/H]\leq-2.8$, with available high-resolution spectra. Our results show that at these low [Fe/H], Sculptor is deficient in light elements (e.g. C, Na, Al, Mg) relative to both the Milky Way halo, and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, pointing towards significant contribution of high-energy supernovae. Furthermore, the abundance pattern of the star AS0039 is best fitted with a zero-metallicity hypernova progenitor, with a mass of $M=20$M$\_\odot$. Our results in Sculptor, at $\rm[Fe/H]\leq-3$, therefore suggest significant enrichment by both very low-energy supernovae and hypernovae, solidifying this galaxy as one of the benchmarks for understanding the energy distribution of the first supernova in the Universe.
