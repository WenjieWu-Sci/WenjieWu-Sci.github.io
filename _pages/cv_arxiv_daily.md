2024-10-09, **Memory-Burdened Primordial Black Holes as Astrophysical Particle Accelerators**, Michael Zantedeschi et.al., [2410.07037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07037v1)

 The \textit{memory burden} effect, stating that the amount of information stored within a system contributes to its stabilization, is particularly significant in systems with a high capacity for information storage such as black holes. In these systems, the evaporation process is halted, at the latest, after approximately half of the black hole's initial mass has been radiated away. Consequently, light primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $m\_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{15}\,$g, which are expected to have fully evaporated by present time, may remain viable candidates for dark matter (DM). In this scenario, we demonstrate that their mergers would continue to occur today, leading to the formation of ``young'' black holes that resume evaporating, producing ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays detectable by current experiments. The emission spectrum would be thermal in all Standard Model particle species, offering a clear and distinguishable signature. Current measurements of the isotropic neutrino flux at Earth are in tension with light PBHs as DM candidates within the mass range $7\times10^3\lesssim m\_{\rm PBH}/{\rm g}\lesssim 4\times 10^8$, if neutrinos are of Majorana nature. We also discuss the potential for refining these constraints through gamma-ray and cosmic-ray observations, as well as gravitational wave detections.

2024-10-09, **Probing blackbody components in gamma-ray bursts from black hole neutrino-dominated accretion flows**, Xiao-Yan Li et.al., [2410.07033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07033v1)

 A stellar-mass black hole (BH) surrounded by a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) is generally considered to be the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Neutrinos escaping from the disk will annihilate out of the disk to produce the fireball that could power GRBs with blackbody (BB) components. The initial GRB jet power and fireball launch radius are related to the annihilation luminosity and annihilation height of the NDAFs, respectively. In this paper, we collect 7 GRBs with known redshifts and identified BB components to test whether the NDAF model works. We find that, in most cases, the values of the accretion rates and the central BH properties are all in the reasonable range, suggesting that these BB components indeed originate from the neutrino annihilation process.

2024-10-09, **Relaxing Limits from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on Heavy Neutral Leptons with Axion-like Particles**, Frank F. Deppisch et.al., [2410.06970v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06970v1)

 Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are constrained by requirements of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) as their decays significantly impact the formation of the primordial elements. We propose here a model where the primary decay channel for the HNLs is to an axion-like particle (ALP) and a neutrino. Consequently, HNLs can decay earlier and evade the BBN bound for lower masses, provided the ALPs themselves decay considerably later. Further cosmological and astrophysical constraints limit severely the range of validity of the ALP properties. We find that a new parameter region opens up for HNLs with masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, and active-sterile neutrino mixing strengths between $10^{-9}$ and $10^{-6}$ that is consistent with constraints and can be probed in future searches. In such a scenario, current bounds as well as sensitivities of future direct HNL searches such as at NA62 and DUNE will be affected.

2024-10-09, **A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field**, Lian-Bao Jia et.al., [2410.06604v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06604v1)

 In this paper, we try to interpret the origin of dark energy in quantum field theory (QFT). The vacuum energy of a field in QFT is a quartic-divergence input, and its physical contribution to dark energy is calculated in the UV-free scheme. There is a mass-energy window that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal hierarchical spectrum of neutrinos is preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is about 6.3 meV $\lesssim m\_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m\_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m\_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.

2024-10-09, **Simulating realistic self-interacting dark matter models including small and large-angle scattering**, Cenanda Arido et.al., [2410.07175v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07175v1)

 Dark matter (DM) self-interactions alter the matter distribution on galactic scales and alleviate tensions with observations. A feature of the self-interaction cross section is its angular dependence, influencing offsets between galaxies and DM halos in merging galaxy clusters. While algorithms for modelling mostly forward-dominated or mostly large-angle scatterings exist, incorporating realistic angular dependencies, such as light mediator models, within $N$-body simulations remains challenging. We develop, validate and apply a novel and efficient method, combining existing approaches to describe small- and large-angle scattering regimes within a hybrid scheme. Below a critical angle the effective description via a drag force combined with transverse momentum diffusion is used, while above the angle-dependence is sampled explicitly. First, we verify the scheme using a test set-up with known analytical solutions, and check that our results are insensitive to the choice of the critical angle within an expected range. Next, we demonstrate that our scheme speeds up the computations by multiple orders of magnitude for realistic light mediator models. Finally, we apply the method to galaxy cluster mergers and discuss the sensitivity of the offset between galaxies and DM to the angle-dependence of the cross section. Our scheme ensures accurate offsets for mediator mass $m\_\phi$ and DM mass $m\_\chi$ within the range $0.1v/c\lesssim m\_\phi/m\_\chi\lesssim v/c$, while for larger (smaller) mass ratios the offsets obtained for isotropic (forward-dominated) self-scattering are approached. Here $v$ is the typical velocity scale. Equivalently, the upper condition can be expressed as $1.1\lesssim \sigma\_{\rm tot}/\sigma\_{\mathrm{\widetilde{T}}}\lesssim 10$ for the ratio of total and momentum transfer cross sections, with the ratio being $1$ ($\infty$) in the isotropic (forward-dominated) limits.

2024-10-09, **Dark sector interactions in light of weak lensing data**, M. Benetti et.al., [2410.07057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07057v1)

 The current observational tensions in the standard cosmological model have reinforced the research on dynamical dark energy, in particular on models with non-gravitational interaction between the dark components. Late-time observables like type Ia supernovas (SNe Ia) and large-scale structures (LSS) point to an energy flux from dark energy to dark matter, while the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) points to a small flux from dark matter to dark energy, fully consistent with no interaction at all. As background and visible matter tests are insensitive to the suppression/enhancement in the dark matter power spectrum, which is a characteristic of interacting models, while the CMB spectrum is strongly affected by it, this could be the origin of those results. In order to confirm it and at the same time to rule out the role of possible systematics between early and late-time observations, the use of a low redshift observable sensitive to the gravitational potential generated by dark matter is crucial. In the present paper, we investigate the observational viability of a class of interacting dark energy models, namely with energy exchange between vacuum-type and dust components, in the light of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) observations of galaxy weak lensing, in the context of a spatially-flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. The best fit of our analysis is compatible with null interaction, with a weak preference for an energy flux from dark matter to dark energy, confirming the CMB based constraints.

2024-10-09, **Distinguishing dark matter halos with Extreme mass ratio inspirals**, Yang Zhao et.al., [2410.06882v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06882v1)

 Using the static, spherically symmetric metric for a black hole (BH) immersed in dark matter (DM) halo characterized by Hernquist, Burkert, and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density distributions, we calculate the orbital periods and precessions, along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) surrounded by DM halos. For the Hernquist model, we find that the gravitational force exerted by the central BH is decreased by DM halos, while DM halos put additional gravitational force on the SCO. The presence of both Burkert-type and NFW-type DM halos enhances the gravitational force acting on the SCO, resulting in a decrease in the period $P$, with the decrease depending on $M/a\_0^2$; additionally, we find that the reduction in orbital precession due to DM halos is influenced by $M/a\_0^2$. The presence of DM halos leads to a slower evolution of EMRIs within Hernquist-type halos, while it accelerates evolution for EMRIs in Burkert-type and NFW-type halos; furthermore, it slows the decrease of eccentricity across all three types of DM halos. By calculating the number of orbital cycles and the gravitational waveform mismatches among these three types of DM halos, as well as between scenarios with and without DM halos, we find that DM halos can be detected when $M/a\_0>10^{-5}$, $M/a\_0>10^{-3}$, and $M/a\_0>10^{-3}$ for Hernquist-type, NFW-type, and Burkert-type DM halos, respectively. Additionally, we can distinguish between NFW-type and Burkert-type DM halos when $M/a\_0> 10^{-3}$; NFW-type and Hernquist-type DM halos, as well as Burkert-type and Hernquist-type DM halos, can be distinguished when $M/a\_0> 10^{-5}$.

2024-10-09, **Transients by Black Hole Formation from Red Supergiants: Impact of Dense Circumstellar Matter**, Daichi Tsuna et.al., [2410.07055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07055v1)

 Failed supernovae (SNe), which are likely the main channel for forming stellar-mass black holes, are predicted to accompany mass ejections much weaker than typical core-collapse SNe. We conduct a grid of one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations to explore the emission of failed SNe from red supergiant progenitors, leveraging recent understanding of the weak explosion and the dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding these stars. We find from these simulations and semi-analytical modeling that diffusion in the CSM prolongs the early emission powered by shock breakout/cooling. The early emission has peak luminosities of $\sim 10^7$-$10^8~L\_\odot$ in optical and UV, and durations of days to weeks. The presence of dense CSM aids detection of the early bright peak from these events via near-future wide-field surveys such as Rubin Observatory, ULTRASAT and UVEX.

2024-10-09, **Cosmic Ray-Driven Galactic Winds with Resolved ISM and Ion-Neutral Damping**, Brandon Sike et.al., [2410.06988v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06988v1)

 Feedback processes in galaxies dictate their structure and evolution. Baryons can be cycled through stars, which inject energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) in supernova explosions, fueling multiphase galactic winds. Cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated at supernova remnants are an important component of feedback. CRs can effectively contribute to wind driving; however, their impact heavily depends on the assumed CR transport model. We run high-resolution "tallbox" simulations of a patch of a galactic disk using the moving mesh magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO, including varied CR implementations and the CRISP non-equilibrium thermochemistry model. We characterize the impact of CR feedback on star formation and multiphase outflows. While CR-driven winds are able to supply energy to a global-scale wind, a purely thermal wind loses most of its energy by the time it reaches 3 kpc above the disk midplane. We further find that the adopted CR transport model significantly affects the steady-state of the wind. In the model with CR advection, streaming, diffusion, and nonlinear Landau damping, CRs provide very strong feedback. Additionally accounting for ion-neutral damping (IND) decouples CRs from the cold ISM, which reduces the impact of CRs on the star formation rate. Nevertheless, CRs in this most realistic model are able to accelerate warm gas and levitate cool gas in the wind but have little effect on cold gas and hot gas. This model displays moderate mass loading and significant CR energy loading, demonstrating that IND does not prevent CRs from providing effective feedback.

2024-10-09, **Optical and near-infrared photometry of 94 type II supernovae from the Carnegie Supernova Project**, J. P. Anderson et.al., [2410.06738v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06738v1)

 Type II supernovae (SNeII) mark the endpoint in the lives of hydrogen-rich massive stars. Their large explosion energies and luminosities allow us to measure distances, metallicities, and star formation rates into the distant Universe. To fully exploit their use in answering different astrophysical problems, high-quality low-redshift data sets are required. Such samples are vital to understand the physics of SNeII, but also to serve as calibrators for distinct - and often lower-quality - samples. We present uBgVri optical and YJH near-infrared (NIR) photometry for 94 low-redshift SNeII observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). A total of 9817 optical and 1872 NIR photometric data points are released, leading to a sample of high-quality SNII light curves during the first ~150 days post explosion on a well-calibrated photometric system. The sample is presented and its properties are analysed and discussed through comparison to literature events. We also focus on individual SNeII as examples of classically defined subtypes and outlier objects. Making a cut in the plateau decline rate of our sample (s2), a new subsample of fast-declining SNeII is presented. The sample has a median redshift of 0.015, with the nearest event at 0.001 and the most distant at 0.07. At optical wavelengths (V), the sample has a median cadence of 4.7 days over the course of a median coverage of 80 days. In the NIR (J), the median cadence is 7.2 days over the course of 59 days. The fast-declining subsample is more luminous than the full sample and shows shorter plateau phases. Of the non-standard SNeII highlighted, SN2009A particularly stands out with a steeply declining then rising light curve, together with what appears to be two superimposed P-Cygni profiles of H-alpha in its spectra. We outline the significant utility of these data, and finally provide an outlook of future SNII science.

2024-10-09, **An X-ray Shell Reveals the Supernova Explosion for Galactic Microquasar SS 433**, Yi-Heng Chi et.al., [2410.06510v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06510v1)

 How black holes are formed remains an open and fundamental question in Astrophysics. Despite theoretical predictions, it lacks observations to understand whether the black hole formation experiences a supernova explosion. Here we report the discovery of an X-ray shell north of the Galactic micro-quasar SS 433 harboring a stellar-mass black hole spatially associated with radio continuum and polarization emissions, and an HI cloud. Its spectrum can be reproduced by a 1-keV under-ionized plasma, from which the shell is inferred to have been created by a supernova explosion 20-30 kyr ago and its properties constitute evidence for canonical SN explosions to create some black holes. Our analysis precludes other possible origins including heated by jets or blown by disk winds. According to the lower mass limit of the compact object in SS 433, we roughly deduced that the progenitor should be more massive than 25 M$\_{\odot}$. The existence of such a young remnant in SS 433 can also lead to new insights into the supercritical accretion in young microquasars and the ${\gamma}$-ray emission of this system. The fallback ejecta may provide accretion materials within tens of thousands of years while the shock of the supernova remnant may play a crucial role in the cosmic ray (re)acceleration.

2024-10-09, **Kinematic Insights Into Luminous Blue Variables and B[e] Supergiants**, Julian A. Deman et.al., [2410.06448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06448v1)

 Recent work suggests that many luminous blue variables (LBVs) and B[e] supergiants (sgB[e]) are isolated, implying that they may be products of massive binaries, kicked by partner supernovae (SNe). However, the evidence is somewhat complex and controversial. To test this scenario, we measure the proper-motion velocities for these objects in the LMC and SMC, using Gaia Data Release 3. Our LMC results show that the kinematics, luminosities, and IR properties point to LBVs and sgB[e] stars being distinct classes. We find that Class 1 LBVs, which have dusty nebulae, and sgB[e] stars both show velocity distributions comparable to that of SMC field OBe stars, which are known to have experienced SN kicks. The sgB[e] stars are faster, plausibly due to their lower average masses. However, Class 2 LBVs, which are luminous objects without dusty nebulae, show no signs of acceleration, therefore suggesting that they are single stars, pre-SN binaries, or perhaps binary mergers. The candidate LBV Class 3 stars, which are dominated by hot dust, are all confirmed sgB[e] stars; their luminosities and velocities show that they simply represent the most luminous and massive of the sgB[e] class. There are very few SMC objects, but the sgB[e] stars are faster than their LMC counterparts, which may be consistent with expectations that lower-metallicity binaries are tighter, causing faster ejections. We also examine the distinct class of dust-free, weak-lined sgB[e] stars, finding that the SMC objects have the fastest velocities of the entire sample.

2024-10-09, **LIGO Core-Collapse Supernova Detection using Convolution Neural Networks**, Zhicheng Pan et.al., [2410.06430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06430v1)

 Core-Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) remain a critical focus in the search for gravitational waves (GWs) in modern astronomy. Their detection and subsequent analysis will enhance our understanding of the explosion mechanisms in massive stars. This paper investigates a combination of time-frequency analysis tools with convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance the detection of GWs originating from CCSNe. The CNN was trained in the time-frequency domain using simulated data from Advanced LIGO (aLIGO). We preprocess the data using the widely used Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and the Q-transform. Our CNN model achieves a remarkable 100% prediction rate for CCSNe GW events with a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) greater than 0.5. We found that the STFT outperforms the Q-transform for SNRs below 0.5.
