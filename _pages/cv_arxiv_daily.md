2024-12-30, **Two-component Dark Matter and low scale Thermal Leptogenesis**, Subhaditya Bhattacharya et.al., [2412.21202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21202v1)

 The observable cosmos exhibits sizable baryon asymmetry, small active neutrino masses, and the presence of dark matter (DM). To address these phenomena together, we propose a two component DM scenario in an extension of Scotogenic model, imposing $\mathbb{Z}\_2 \otimes \mathbb{Z}\_2^{\prime}$ symmetry. The electroweak sphaleron process converts the $\rm Y\_{B-L}^{}$ yield, generated through the Leptogenesis mechanism, into the baryon asymmetry ($\rm Y\_{\Delta B}^{}$) at $T\_{\rm sph}\sim 131.7$ GeV, the sphalerons decoupling temperature. In this framework, the CP asymmetry as well as the radiative neutrino mass generation explicitly involve the two DM particles, thus establishing a correlation between the baryon asymmetry, DM and observed active neutrino masses. We study in details the allowed parameter space available after considering all the constraints from the three phenomena as well as from the collider search limits, and outline the region which could potentially be tested in future DM detection experiments through direct or indirect detection searches, lepton flavor-violating decays, etc.

2024-12-30, **Cosmological Signatures of Neutrino Seesaw**, Chengcheng Han et.al., [2412.21045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21045v1)

 The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by the seesaw mechanism through singlet right-handed neutrinos, which can further explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In this work, we propose a new approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the interaction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos. After inflation the inflaton predominantly decays into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is modulated by the fluctuations of Higgs field which act as the source of curvature perturbations. We demonstrate that this modulation produces primordial non-Gaussian signatures, which can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to probe a large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new window for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.

2024-12-30, **Probing Long-Range Forces Between Neutrinos with Cosmic Structures**, David E. Kaplan et.al., [2412.20766v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20766v1)

 We study the consequences of new long-range forces between neutrinos on cosmic scales. If these forces are a few orders of magnitude stronger than gravity, they can induce perturbation instability in the non-relativistic cosmic neutrino background in the late time universe. As a result, the cosmic neutrino background may form nonlinear bound states instead of free-streaming. The implications of the formation of nonlinear neutrino bound states include enhancing matter perturbations and triggering star formation. Based on existing measurements of the matter power spectrum and reionization history, we place new constraints on long-range forces between neutrinos with ranges lying in $1 \text{ kpc}\lesssim m\_\phi^{-1} \lesssim 10 \text{ Mpc}$.

2024-12-30, **Pathways to proton's stability via naturally small neutrino masses**, Sin Kyu Kang et.al., [2412.20723v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20723v1)

 In the present work, the connection between the smallness of the neutrino masses and the stability of the proton is studied. We analyze this connection from different perspectives: the smallness of neutrino mass and the proton stability originate from the same source, small neutrino masses lead to a long lived proton, and the smallness of the proton decay width as a cause of the naturally small neutrino masses. All the schemes are studied in detail and UV realizations are given. We discuss advantages of each scheme and outline further investigation directions.

2024-12-30, **Hint at an axion-like particle from GRB 221009A**, Giorgio Galanti et.al., [2412.21175v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21175v1)

 The detection by the LHAASO Collaboration of the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A at redshift $z = 0.151$ with energies up to $(13-18) \, \rm TeV$ challenges conventional physics. Photons emitted with energies above $10 \, \rm TeV$ at this redshift can hardly be observed on Earth due to their interaction with the extragalactic background light (EBL). We show that indeed the LHAASO Collaboration should not have observed photons with energies above $10 \, \rm TeV$ if the state-of-the-art EBL model by Saldana-Lopez et al. is taken into account. A problem therefore arises: the Universe should be more transparent than currently believed. We also show that the issue is solved if we introduce the interaction of photons with axion-like particles (ALPs). ALPs are predicted by String Theory, are among the best candidates for dark matter and can produce spectral and polarization effects on astrophysical sources in the presence of external magnetic fields. In particular, for GRB 221009A, photon-ALP oscillations occur within the crossed magnetized media, i.e. the host galaxy, the extragalactic space, the Milky Way, partially reducing the EBL absorption to a level that explains the LHAASO detection of GRB 221009A and its observed spectrum without the need of contrived choices of parameter values, which are instead compulsory within proposed emission models within conventional physics. This fact regarding GRB 221009A represents a strong hint at the ALP existence, which adds to two other indications coming from blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei.

2024-12-30, **On spectral stability of one- and bi-frequency solitary waves in Soler model in (3+1)D**, Nabile Boussa√Ød et.al., [2412.21170v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21170v1)

 For the nonlinear Dirac equation with scalar self-interaction (the Soler model) in three spatial dimensions, we consider the linearization at solitary wave solutions and find the invariant spaces which correspond to different spherical harmonics, thus achieving the radial reduction of the spectral stability analysis. We apply the same technique to the bi-frequency solitary waves (which are generically present in the Soler model) and show that they can also possess linear stability properties similar to those of one-frequency solitary waves.

2024-12-30, **Probing Gravitational Dark Matter with Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves**, Yong Xu et.al., [2412.21137v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21137v1)

 The evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM) is compelling, yet its nature remains elusive. A particularly interesting and minimal scenario involves DM with pure gravitational interactions. In the early Universe, such DM can be unavoidably generated via annihilation of particles in the standard model (SM) thermal plasma. It is known that the SM thermal plasma also produces gravitational waves (GWs). In this study, we point out a simple and tight connection between the amplitude of the thermal GWs and the properties of pure gravitational DM. Notably, future GW experiments in the ultra-high frequency regime have the potential to shed light on the mass and spin of pure gravitational DM.

2024-12-30, **Effects of asymmetric dark matter on a magnetized neutron star: A two-fluid approach**, Pinku Routaray et.al., [2412.21097v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21097v1)

 We study the interaction between dark matter (DM) and highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), focusing on how DM particle mass, mass fraction, and magnetic field (MF) strength affect NS structure and stability. We consider self-interacting, non-annihilating, asymmetric fermionic DM that couples to NSs only through gravitational interaction. Using the QMC-RMF4 relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent magnetic fields, we investigate the magnetized equation of state and examine the accumulation of DM under various conditions. Our results show that as the DM fraction increases, the maximum gravitational mass of the NS decreases, especially for heavier DM particles, while lighter DM particles can induce a transition from a dark core to a halo structure, increasing the maximum mass. Strong MFs soften the equation of state and reduce the dark mass a NS core can retain before transitioning to a halo.

2024-12-30, **Time modulation of weak nuclear decays as a probe of axion dark matter**, Jorge Alda et.al., [2412.20932v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20932v1)

 We investigate the time modulation of weak nuclear decays as a method to probe axion dark matter. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework to compute the $\theta$-dependence of weak nuclear decays, including electron capture and $\beta$ decay, which enables us to predict the time variation of weak radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. As an application, we recast old data sets, from the weak nuclear decays of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ and ${^{137}\text{Cs}}$ taken at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory, in order to set constraints on the axion decay constant, specifically in the axion mass range from few $10^{-23}\;$eV up to $10^{-19}\;$eV. We finally propose a new measurement at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the weak nuclear decay of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ via electron capture, in order to explore even shorter timescales, thus reaching sensitivities to axion masses up to $10^{-9}\;$eV.

2024-12-30, **Mergers of Binary Primordial Black Holes in Evolving Dark Matter Halos**, V. D. Stasenko et.al., [2412.20859v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20859v1)

 The influence of a dark matter halo around pair of primordial black holes on their orbit evolution and the black hole merger rate is considered. Because of the nonspherical (nonradial) contraction of DM shells, each shell upon the first contraction passes through the halo center in the direction of the radius vector corresponding to zero angular momentum. Since the shell contraction is a continuous process, at each instant of time there is a nonzero dark matter density at the halo center. This density is determined by the influence of the tidal gravitational forces from inflationary density perturbations and from other primordial black holes. The scattering of dark matter particles by a pair of black holes leads to a loss of the energy of its orbital motion and to an accelerated pair merger. In the case of primordial black holes with masses $\sim30M\_\odot$, the black hole merger rate in the presence of a dark matter halo is several times higher than that without such a halo.

2024-12-30, **Probing Light Bosonic Dark Matter with Transmon Qubits**, Wei Chao et.al., [2412.20850v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20850v1)

 In this paper, we investigate the constraints of the transmon qubit, an improved version of the charge qubit, on bosonic light dark matters. Phonon excitations induced by the scattering or absorption of dark matter on a superconductor may destroy the Cooper pair, leading to the production of quasiparticles made by the electron. By measuring the production rate of the quasiparticle density, one may read out the coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter, assuming that these quasiparticles are solely induced by dark matter interactions. For the first time, we show constraints on the parameter space of the dark photon, light scalar dark matter, and axion-like particles from the measurement of quasiparticles in transmon qubit experiments. This study offers insights for the development of quantum qubit experiments aimed at the direct detection of dark matter in underground laboratories.

2024-12-30, **Lower Limits on Scalar Ultralight Dark Matter from Optical Cavities**, Tejas Deshpande et.al., [2412.20623v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20623v1)

 Oscillations of scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) at its Compton frequency would couple to fundamental constants to coherently drive the length of nearby Fabry-Perot cavities. Resulting differences in the length of two cavities are searched for in the spectrum of the beat note between lasers traversing the cavities. The new direct ULDM bounds set near 5 kHz and between 20 and 90 kHz are one to two orders of magnitude lower for two model ULDM distributions -- a standard galactic halo, and a relaxion star bound to Earth. Laser filtering and mechanical isolation are critical.

2024-12-30, **Diprotodon on the sky. The Large Galactic Supernova Remnant (SNR) G278.94+1.35**, Miroslav D. Filipoviƒá et.al., [2412.20836v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20836v1)

 We present a re-discovery of G278.94+1.35 as possibly one of the largest known Galactic supernova remnants (SNR) - that we name Diprotodon. While previously established as a Galactic SNR, Diprotodon is visible in our new EMU and GLEAM radio continuum images at an angular size of 3.33x3.23 deg, much larger than previously measured. At the previously suggested distance of 2.7 kpc, this implies a diameter of 157x152 pc. This size would qualify Diprotodon as the largest known SNR and pushes our estimates of SNR sizes to the upper limits. We investigate the environment in which the SNR is located and examine various scenarios that might explain such a large and relatively bright SNR appearance. We find that Diprotodon is most likely at a much closer distance of $\sim$1 kpc, implying its diameter is 58x56 pc and it is in the radiative evolutionary phase. We also present a new Fermi-LAT data analysis that confirms the angular extent of the SNR in gamma-rays. The origin of the high-energy emission remains somewhat puzzling, and the scenarios we explore reveal new puzzles, given this unexpected and unique observation of a seemingly evolved SNR having a hard GeV spectrum with no breaks. We explore both leptonic and hadronic scenarios, as well as the possibility that the high-energy emission arises from the leftover particle population of a historic pulsar wind nebula.

2024-12-30, **Constraining the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity using cosmological data**, Shambel Sahlu et.al., [2412.20831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20831v1)

 This paper examines the late-time accelerating Universe and the formation of large-scale structures within the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity framework, specifically using the $f(Q)$-gravity model, in light of recent cosmological data. After reviewing the background history of the Universe, and the linear cosmological perturbations, we consider the toy model $F(Q) = \alpha\sqrt{Q}+\beta$ ( where $Q$ represents nonmetricity, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model parameters) for further analysis. To evaluate the cosmological viability of this model, we utilize 57 Observational Hubble Data (OHD) points, 1048 supernovae distance modulus measurements (SNIa), their combined analysis (OHD+SNIa), 14 growth rate data points (f-data), and 30 redshift-space distortions (f$\sigma\_8$) datasets. Through a detailed statistical analysis, the comparison between our model and $\Lambda$CDM has been conducted after we compute the best-fit values through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Based on the results, we obtain the Hubble parameter, $H\_0 = 69.20^{+4.40}\_{{-}2.10}$ and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum normalization $\sigma\_8 = 0.827^{+0.03}\_{{-}0.01}$. These values suggest that our model holds significant promise in addressing the cosmological tensions.
