2024-03-11, **Performance of SK-Gd's Upgraded Real-time Supernova Monitoring System**, The Super-Kamiokande collaboration et.al., [2403.06760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06760v1)

 Among multi-messenger observations of the next galactic core-collapse supernova, Super-Kamiokande (SK) plays a critical role in detecting the emitted supernova neutrinos, determining the direction to the supernova (SN), and notifying the astronomical community of these observations in advance of the optical signal. On 2022, SK has increased the gadolinium dissolved in its water target (SK-Gd) and has achieved a Gd concentration of 0.033%, resulting in enhanced neutron detection capability, which in turn enables more accurate determination of the supernova direction. Accordingly, SK-Gd's real-time supernova monitoring system (Abe te al. 2016b) has been upgraded. SK\_SN Notice, a warning system that works together with this monitoring system, was released on December 13, 2021, and is available through GCN Notices (Barthelmy et al. 2000). When the monitoring system detects an SN-like burst of events, SK\_SN Notice will automatically distribute an alarm with the reconstructed direction to the supernova candidate within a few minutes. In this paper, we present a systematic study of SK-Gd's response to a simulated galactic SN. Assuming a supernova situated at 10 kpc, neutrino fluxes from six supernova models are used to characterize SK-Gd's pointing accuracy using the same tools as the online monitoring system. The pointing accuracy is found to vary from 3-7$^\circ$ depending on the models. However, if the supernova is closer than 10 kpc, SK\_SN Notice can issue an alarm with three-degree accuracy, which will benefit follow-up observations by optical telescopes with large fields of view.

2024-03-11, **Observing neutrinos from failed Supernovae at LNGS**, Giulia Pagliaroli et.al., [2403.06678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06678v1)

 We discuss the possibility to observe neutrinos emitted from a failed core collapse Supernova in the various experiments at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. We show that the veto regions of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments can be used as a network of small detectors to measure Supernova neutrinos. In addition we show that this network can measure very precisely the moment of black hole formation, which can be then used in the nearby VIRGO detector and future Einstein Telescope to look for the gravitational wave counterpart to the neutrino signal.

2024-03-11, **Study of dark matter scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei within chiral effective field theory**, E. Filandri et.al., [2403.06599v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06599v1)

 We study dark matter, assumed to be composed by weak interacting massive particles (WIMPs), scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei. In order to parameterize the WIMP-nucleon interaction the chiral effective field theory approach is used. Considering only interactions invariant under parity, charge conjugation and time reversal, we examine five interaction types: scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial and tensor. Scattering amplitudes between two nucleons and a WIMP are determined up to second order of chiral perturbation theory. We apply this program to calculate the interaction rate as function of the WIMP mass and of the magnitude of the WIMP-quark coupling constants. From our study, we conclude that the scalar nuclear response functions result much greater than the others due to theirs large combination of low energy constants. We verify that the leading order contributions are dominant in this low energy processes. We also provide an estimate for the background due to atmospheric neutrinos.

2024-03-11, **Distinguishing Dirac/Majorana Heavy Neutrino at Future Lepton Colliders**, Qing-Hong Cao et.al., [2403.06561v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06561v1)

 We propose to identify whether a sterile neutrino is Dirac-type or Majorana-type by counting the peak of the rapidity distribution at lepton colliders. Our method requires only one charged-lepton tagging, and the nature of sterile neutrinos can be pinned down once they are confirmed.

2024-03-10, **Detecting Neutrinos from Supernova Bursts in PandaX-4T**, Binyu Pang et.al., [2403.06220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06220v1)

 Neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae are essential for the understanding of neutrino physics and stellar evolution. The dual-phase xenon dark matter detectors can provide a way to track explosions of galactic supernovae by detecting neutrinos through coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings. In this study, a variation of progenitor masses as well as explosion models are assumed to predict the neutrino fluxes and spectra, which result in the number of expected neutrino events ranging from 6.6 to 13.7 at a distance of 10 kpc over a 10-second duration with negligible backgrounds at PandaX-4T. Two specialized triggering alarms for monitoring supernova burst neutrinos are built. The efficiency of detecting supernova explosions at various distances in the Milky Way is estimated. These alarms will be implemented in the real-time supernova monitoring system at PandaX-4T in the near future, providing the astronomical communities with supernova early warnings.

2024-03-10, **Constraining dark matter model using 21cm line intensity mapping**, Koya Murakami et.al., [2403.06203v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06203v1)

 We apply the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the mock 21cm maps from the post-reionization epoch to show that the $\Lambda$CDM and warm dark matter (WDM) model can be distinguished for WDM particle masses $m\_{FD}<3$ keV, under the assumption of thermal production of WDM following the Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution. We demonstrate that the CNN is a potent tool in distinguishing the dark matter masses, highlighting its sensitivity to the subtle differences in the 21cm maps produced by varying dark matter masses. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to encompass different WDM production mechanisms, recognizing that the dark matter production mechanism in the early Universe is among the sources of the most significant uncertainty for the dark matter model building.   In this work, given the mass of the dark matter, we discuss the feasibility of discriminating four different WDM models: Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution model, neutrino Minimal Standard Model ($\nu$MSM), Dodelson-Widrow (DW), and Shi-Fuller (SF) model. For instance, when the WDM mass is 2 keV, we show that one can differentiate between CDM, FD, $\nu$MSM, and DW models while discerning between the DW and SF models turns out to be challenging. Our results reinforce the viability of the CNN as a robust analysis for 21cm maps and shed light on its potential to unravel the features associated with different dark matter production mechanisms.

2024-03-10, **Expected Performance of Cosmic Muon Veto Detector**, Raj Shah et.al., [2403.06114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06114v1)

 The India-Based Neutrino Observatory (INO) collaboration houses the miniICAL detector, at the transit campus of IICHEP, Madurai, India, which serves as a prototype-detector of the larger Iron-Calorimeter detector (ICAL). The purpose of miniICAL lies in unraveling the intricate engineering challenges inherent in constructing a substantial ICAL-type detector. To explore the feasibility of building a large-scale neutrino experiment at shallow depths the collaboration has embarked upon the construction of a Cosmic Muon Veto Detector (CMVD) around the miniICAL detector. The primary objective of this endeavor revolves around attaining a veto efficiency surpassing $99.99\%$, while simultaneously maintaining a false-positive rate lower than $10^{-5}$.   The CMVD system is based on extruded plastic scintillators (EPS) and utilizes wavelength-shifting fibers to collect scintillation photons and uses silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) as photo-transducers. The expected performance of the CMVD is estimated using simulated muon tracks in the miniICAL stack taking into account efficiency, multiplicity of RPC detectors from the miniICAL data as well as the noise of SiPM, observed SiPM spectra and time resolution due to cosmic muon along the whole length of EPS etc.   The CMVD experiment is a crucial step in the larger context of neutrino research, by increasing the veto efficiency of cosmic muons, the CMVD experiment helps to pave the way for future large-scale shallow-depth neutrino experiments, providing valuable insights into the study of neutrinos and their properties.

2024-03-10, **Effects of a dark matter caustic passing through the Oort Cloud**, Yuxin Zhao et.al., [2403.06314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06314v1)

 We investigate the effect of a dark matter caustic passing through the Solar System. We find, confirming a previous result, that the Sun tracks the caustic surface for some time. We integrate numerically the equations of motion of the Sun and a comet for a large number of initial conditions and of caustic passage properties. We calculate the probability for the comet to escape the Solar System and the probability for it to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun, given the initial semi-major axis and eccentricity of its orbit. We find that the average probability for a comet to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun is of order $3 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and that comets which are initially at a distance larger than about $10^5$ A.U. have a probability of order one to be ejected from the Solar System.

2024-03-10, **Dark Branes for Dark Matter**, Fotis Koutroulis et.al., [2403.06276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06276v1)

 We propose a setup for the origin of dark matter based on spacetime with a warped extra dimension and three branes: the Planck brane, the TeV brane, at a (few) TeV scale $\rho\_T$, and a dark brane, at a (sub)-GeV scale $\rho\_1\lesssim 100$ GeV $\ll\rho\_T$. The Standard Model is localized in the TeV brane, thus solving the Higgs hierarchy problem, while the dark matter $\chi$, a Dirac fermion with mass $m\_\chi<\rho\_1$, is localized in the dark brane. The radion, with mass $m\_r<m\_\chi$, interacts strongly ($\sim m\_\chi/\rho\_1\sim\mathcal O(1)$) with dark matter and very weakly ($\sim m\_{f}\rho\_1/\rho\_T^2\ll 1$) with the Standard Model matter $f$. The generic conflict between the bounds on its detection signatures and its proper relic abundance is avoided as dark matter annihilation is $p$-wave suppressed. The former is determined by its very weak interactions with the SM and the latter by its much stronger annihilation into radions. Therefore, there is a vast range in the Dark Matter's parameter space where the correct relic abundance is achieved consistently with the existing bounds. Moreover, for the dark brane with $\rho\_1\lesssim 10$ GeV, a confinement/deconfinement first order phase transition, where the radion condensates, produces a stochastic gravitational waves background at the nanoHz frequencies, which can be identified with the signal detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. In the PTA window, for $0.15 \textrm{ GeV}\lesssim m\_\chi\lesssim 0.5$ GeV the relic abundance is reproduced and all constraints are satisfied.

2024-03-10, **Strong Lensing by Galaxy Clusters**, Priyamvada Natarajan et.al., [2403.06245v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06245v1)

 Galaxy clusters as gravitational lenses play a unique role in astrophysics and cosmology: they permit mapping the dark matter distribution on a range of scales; they reveal the properties of high and intermediate redshift background galaxies that would otherwise be unreachable with telescopes; they constrain the particle nature of dark matter and are a powerful probe of global cosmological parameters, like the Hubble constant. In this review we summarize the current status of cluster lensing observations and the insights they provide, and offer a glimpse into the capabilities that ongoing, and the upcoming next generation of telescopes and surveys will deliver. While many open questions remain, cluster lensing promises to remain at the forefront of discoveries in astrophysics and cosmology.

2024-03-10, **Estimating the mass of galactic components using machine learning algorithms**, Jessica N. Lopez Sanchez et.al., [2403.06178v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06178v1)

 The estimation of the bulge and disk massses, the main baryonic components of a galaxy, can be performed using various approaches, but their implementation tend to be challenging as they often rely on strong assumptions about either the baryon dynamics or the dark matter model. In this work, we present an alternative method for predicting the masses of galactic components, including the disk, bulge, stellar and total mass, using a set of machine learning algorithms: KNN-neighbours (KNN), Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN). The rest-frame absolute magnitudes in the ugriz-photometric system were selected as input features, and the training was performed using a sample of spiral galaxies hosting a bulge from Guo's mock catalogue \citep{Guo-Catalog} derived from the Millennium simulation. In general, all the algorithms provide good predictions for the galaxy's mass components ranging from $10^9\,M\_\odot$ to $10^{11}\,M\_\odot$, corresponding to the central region of the training mass domain; however, the NN give rise to the most precise predictions in comparison to other methods. Additionally, to test the performance of the NN architecture, we used a sample of observed galaxies from the SDSS survey whose mass components are known. We found that the NN can predict the luminous masses of disk-dominant galaxies within the same range of magnitudes that for the synthetic sample up to a $99\%$ level of confidence, while mass components of galaxies hosting larger bulges are well predicted up to $95\%$ level of confidence. The NN algorithm can also bring up scaling relations between masses of different components and magnitudes.

2024-03-10, **Constraining Cosmological Parameters with Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas Models in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity: Utilizing Late-time Datasets**, Sayani Maity et.al., [2403.06286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06286v1)

 This study investigates accelerated cosmic expansion using the Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas (VMMG) and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas (GCCM) within Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Our primary objective is to constrain essential cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble Parameter ($H\_{0}$) and Sound Horizon ($r\_{d}$). We incorporate recent datasets comprising 17 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation observations, 33 Cosmic Chronometer measurements, 40 Type Ia Supernovae data points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram data points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts data points. Additionally, we integrate the most recent determination of the Hubble constant (R22). Treating $r\_{d}$ as a free parameter helps alleviate bias, enhance precision, and improve dataset compatibility. By simulating random correlations in the covariance matrix, errors are reduced. The obtained values of ($H\_{0}$) and ($r\_{d}$) are consistent with those from Planck and SDSS. Cosmography tests offer insights into the dynamics of both models, aiding our understanding of cosmological evolution. Statefinder diagnostics deepen our understanding of cosmic expansion dynamics and aid in distinguishing between different cosmological models. The $o\_{m}$ Diagnostic test reveals that at late times, VMMG falls in the phantom region and GCCM falls in the phantom quintessence region. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) provide support for all models under consideration, indicating that each model offers a plausible explanation. Notably, the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges with the lowest AIC score, suggesting its relatively superior fit compared to others. Additionally, validation through the reduced $\chi\_{\text{red}}^{2}$ statistic confirms satisfactory fits across all models, further reinforcing their credibility in explaining the observed data.
