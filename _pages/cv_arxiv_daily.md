2023-04-24, **Constraining the onset density for the QCD phase transition with the neutrino signal from core-collapse supernovae**, Noshad Khosravi Largani et.al., [2304.12316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12316v1)

 The occurrence of a first-order hadron-quark matter phase transition at high baryon densities is investigated in astrophysical simulations of core-collapse supernovae, to decipher yet incompletely understood properties of the dense matter equation of state using neutrinos from such cosmic events. It is found that the emission of a non-standard second neutrino burst, dominated by electron-antineutrinos, is not only a measurable signal for the appearance of deconfined quark matter but also reveals information about the state of matter at extreme conditions encountered at the supernova interior. To this end, a large set of spherically symmetric supernova models is investigated, studying the dependence on the equation of state and on the stellar progenitor. General relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics is employed featuring three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport and a microscopic hadron-quark hybrid matter equation of state class, that covers a representative range of parameters. This facilitates the direct connection between intrinsic signatures of the neutrino signal and properties of the equation of state. In particular, a set of novel relations have been found empirically. These potentially provide a constraint for the onset density of a possible QCD phase transition, which is presently one of the largest uncertainties in modern investigations of the QCD phase diagram, from the future neutrino observation of the next galactic core-collapse supernova.

2023-04-24, **Measurement of Atmospheric Neutrino Mixing with Improved IceCube DeepCore Calibration and Data Processing**, IceCube Collaboration et.al., [2304.12236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12236v1)

 We describe a new data sample of IceCube DeepCore and report on the latest measurement of atmospheric neutrino oscillations obtained with data recorded between 2011-2019. The sample includes significant improvements in data calibration, detector simulation, and data processing, and the analysis benefits from a detailed treatment of systematic uncertainties, with significantly higher level of detail since our last study. By measuring the relative fluxes of neutrino flavors as a function of their reconstructed energies and arrival directions we constrain the atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters to be $\sin^2\theta\_{23} = 0.51\pm 0.05$ and $\Delta m^2\_{32} = 2.41\pm0.07\times 10^{-3}\mathrm{eV}^2$, assuming a normal mass ordering. The resulting 40\% reduction in the error of both parameters with respect to our previous result makes this the most precise measurement of oscillation parameters using atmospheric neutrinos. Our results are also compatible and complementary to those obtained using neutrino beams from accelerators, which are obtained at lower neutrino energies and are subject to different sources of uncertainties.

2023-04-24, **Analyzing the neutron and $γ$-ray emission properties of an americium-beryllium tagged neutron source**, Hiroshi Ito et.al., [2304.12153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12153v1)

 Americium-beryllium (AmBe), a well-known tagged neutron source, is commonly used for evaluating the neutron detection efficiency of detectors used in ultralow background particle physics experiments, such as reactor neutrino and diffuse supernova neutrino background experiments. In particular, AmBe sources are used to calibrate neutron tagging by selecting the 4438-keV $\gamma$-ray signal, which is simultaneously emitted with a neutron signal. Therefore, analyzing the neutron and $\gamma$-ray emission properties of AmBe sources is crucial. In this study, we used the theoretical shape of a neutron energy spectrum, which was divided into three parts, to develop models of the energy spectrum and verify the results using experimental data. We used an AmBe source to measure the energy spectra of simultaneously emitted neutrons and $\gamma$-rays and determine the emission ratio of the neutrons with and without $\gamma$-ray emission. The measured spectrum was consistent with that obtained from the simulated result, whereas the measured emission ratio was significantly different from the corresponding simulated result. Here, we also discuss the feasibility of determining the neutron emission rates from the spectra divided into three parts.

2023-04-24, **Relativistic Configuration-interaction Density Functional Theory: Nuclear Matrix Elements for $ββ$ Decay**, Y. K. Wang et.al., [2304.12009v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12009v1)

 The relativistic configuration-interaction density functional theory is developed for even-even and odd-odd nuclei and is used to predict the nuclear matrix element of the neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay in $^{76}$Ge, amongst the most promising $\beta\beta$-decay candidates. The spectroscopic properties of the $\beta\beta$-decay partners $^{76}$Ge and $^{76}$Se, and the nuclear matrix element governing the two-neutrino $\beta\beta$ ($2\nu\beta\beta$) decay in $^{76}$Ge are well reproduced, providing solid benchmarks for the theoretical calculations. The inclusion of the triaxial degree of freedom slightly enhances the nuclear matrix element of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay while raises that of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay significantly by a factor around two. The present results highlight the importance of nuclear triaxial deformation for a better prediction of the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix element.

2023-04-24, **Terzina on board NUSES: a pathfinder for EAS Cherenkov Light Detection from space**, Leonid Burmistrov et.al., [2304.11992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11992v1)

 In this paper we introduce the Terzina telescope as a part of the NUSES space mission. This telescope aims to detect Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) through the Cherenkov light emission from the extensive air showers (EAS) that they create in the Earth's atmosphere. The Cherenkov photons are aligned along the shower axis inside about $\sim 0.2-1^{\circ}$, so that they become detectable by Terzina when it points towards the Earth's limb. A sun-synchronous orbit will allow the telescope to observe only the night side of the Earth's atmosphere. In this contribution, we focus on the description of the telescope detection goals, geometry, optical design and its photon detection camera composed of Silicon Photo-Multipliers (SiPMs). Moreover, we describe the full Monte Carlo simulation chain developed to estimate Terzina's performance for UHECR detection. The estimate of the radiation damage and light background rates, the readout electronics and trigger logic are briefly described. Terzina will be able to study the potential for future physics missions devoted to UHECR detection and to UHE neutrino astronomy. It is a pathfinder for missions like POEMMA or future constellations of similar satellites to NUSES.

2023-04-23, **Relativistic effects in Green's function Monte Carlo calculations of neutrino-nucleus scattering**, Alexis Nikolakopoulos et.al., [2304.11772v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11772v1)

 Microscopic calculations of neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections are critical for the success of the neutrino-oscillation program. In addition to retaining nuclear correlations in the initial and final state of the reaction, they are based on consistent nuclear interactions and transition current operators, thereby enabling robust uncertainty quantification. In this work, we address a significant limitation of these microscopic methods, which arises from their nonrelativistic nature. By performing the calculations in a reference frame that minimizes nucleon momenta and utilizing the so-called ``two-fragment'' model, we extend the applicability of Green's function Monte Carlo calculations of neutrino-nucleus scattering to higher momenta than currently possible. To validate this approach, we compare our theoretical predictions against inclusive data measured by the MiniBooNE, T2K, and MINER$\nu$A experiments.

2023-04-24, **A Cookbook of Self-Supervised Learning**, Randall Balestriero et.al., [2304.12210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12210v1)

 Self-supervised learning, dubbed the dark matter of intelligence, is a promising path to advance machine learning. Yet, much like cooking, training SSL methods is a delicate art with a high barrier to entry. While many components are familiar, successfully training a SSL method involves a dizzying set of choices from the pretext tasks to training hyper-parameters. Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry into SSL research by laying the foundations and latest SSL recipes in the style of a cookbook. We hope to empower the curious researcher to navigate the terrain of methods, understand the role of the various knobs, and gain the know-how required to explore how delicious SSL can be.

2023-04-24, **EuCl$_3\cdot 6$H$_2$O as the solid-state platform for searches for new P,T-odd physics**, Alexander O. Sushkov et.al., [2304.12105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12105v1)

 Condensed matter systems offer the opportunity to maximize the number of spins, probed in magnetic resonance experiments that search for physics beyond the standard model. EuCl$\_3\cdot 6$H$\_2$O is a promising solid-state platform for such searches. The narrow inhomogeneous linewidth of the Eu optical $^7\hspace{-0.1em}F\_0 \leftrightarrow\,^5\hspace{-0.1em}D\_0$ transition in this material opens the opportunity to optically pump the $^{153}$Eu nuclear spin ensemble into a single hyperfine sublevel. The closely-spaced opposite-parity nuclear energy levels, and the low-energy collective octupole mode, or a possible static octupole deformation, enhance the $^{153}$Eu nuclear Schiff moment. The optimistic estimate of the effective electric field is $E^*=10\,$MV/cm. With this estimate, the CASPEr-electric search for the gluon interaction of axion dark matter can reach QCD axion sensitivity with a 3~cm sample.

2023-04-24, **Quantum Science and the Search for Axion Dark Matter**, Alexander O. Sushkov et.al., [2304.11797v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11797v1)

 The dark matter puzzle is one of the most important open problems in modern physics. The ultra-light axion is a well-motivated dark matter candidate, conceived to resolve the strong-CP problem of quantum chromodynamics. Numerous precision experiments are searching for the three non-gravitational interactions of axion-like dark matter. Some of the searches are approaching fundamental quantum limits on their sensitivity. This Perspective describes several approaches that use quantum engineering to circumvent these limits. Squeezing and single-photon counting can enhance searches for the axion-photon interaction. Optimization of quantum spin ensemble properties is needed to realize the full potential of spin-based searches for the electric-dipole-moment and the gradient interactions of axion dark matter. Several metrological and sensing techniques, developed in the field of quantum information science, are finding natural applications in this area of experimental fundamental physics.

2023-04-23, **MaNGA DynPop -- IV. Stacked total density profile of galaxy groups and clusters from combining dynamical models of integral-field stellar kinematics and galaxy-galaxy lensing**, Chunxiang Wang et.al., [2304.11715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11715v1)

 We present the measurement of total and stellar/dark matter decomposed mass density profile around a sample of galaxy groups and clusters with dynamical masses derived from integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey in Paper~I and weak lensing derived from the DECaLS imaging survey. Combining the two data sets enables accurate measurement of the radial density distribution from several kpc to Mpc scales. Intriguingly, we find that the excess surface density derived from stellar kinematics in the inner region cannot be explained by simply adding an NFW dark matter halo extrapolated from lensing measurement at a larger scale to a stellar mass component derived from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. We find that a good fit to both data sets requires a stellar mass normalization about 3 times higher than that derived from the NSA catalog, which would require an unrealistically too-heavy initial mass function for stellar mass estimation. If we keep the stellar mass normalization to that of the NSA catalog but allow a varying inner dark matter density profile, we obtain an asymptotic slope of $\gamma\_{\rm gnfw}$= $1.82\_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$, $\gamma\_{\rm gnfw}$= $1.48\_{-0.41}^{+0.20}$ for the group bin and the cluster bin respectively, significantly steeper than the NFW case. We also compare the total mass inner density slopes with those from Illustris-TNG300 and find that the values from the simulation are lower than the observation by at least $3\sigma$ level.

2023-04-23, **MaNGA DynPop -- III. Accurate stellar dynamics vs. stellar population relations in 6000 early-type and spiral galaxies: fundamental plane, mass-to-light ratios, total density slopes, and dark matter fractions**, Kai Zhu et.al., [2304.11714v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11714v1)

 We present dynamical scaling relations, combined with the stellar population properties, for a subsample of about 6000 nearby galaxies with the most reliable dynamical models extracted from the full MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies. We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs), which links dynamical mass, projected half-light radius $R\_{\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment $\sigma\_{\rm e}$ within $R\_{\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between $\lg(M/L)(<R\_{\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius $R\_{\rm e}$, and $\lg\sigma\_{\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with $\sigma\_{\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes $\gamma\_{\_{\rm T}}$ and $\sigma\_{\rm e}$: $\gamma\_{\_{\rm T}}$ become steeper with increasing $\sigma\_{\rm e}$ until $\lg(\sigma\_{\rm e}/{\rm km\,s^{-1}})\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $\gamma\_{\_{\rm T}}\approx -2.2$. The $\gamma\_{\_{\rm T}}-\sigma\_{\rm e}$ variation is larger for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $\sigma\_{\rm e}$ the total density profiles steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low dark matter fractions, median $f\_{\rm DM}(<R\_{\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of radius $R\_{\rm e}$. However, we find that $f\_{\rm DM}(<R\_{\rm e})$ depends on $\sigma\_{\rm e}$ better than stellar mass: dark matter increases to a median $f\_{\rm DM}=33$ percent for galaxies with $\sigma\_{\rm e}\lesssim100{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. The increased $f\_{\rm DM}(<R\_{\rm e})$ at low $\sigma\_{\rm e}$ explains the parabolic $\lg(M/L)(<R\_{\rm e})-\lg\sigma\_{\rm e}$ relation.

2023-04-23, **MaNGA DynPop -- II. Global stellar population, gradients, and star-formation histories from integral-field spectroscopy of 10K galaxies: link with galaxy rotation, shape, and total-density gradients**, Shengdong Lu et.al., [2304.11712v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11712v1)

 We analyze the global stellar population, radial gradients and non-parametric star formation history of $\sim 10$K galaxies from the MaNGA Survey final data release 17 (DR17), based on stellar population synthesis and full-spectrum fitting, and relate them with dynamical properties of galaxies. We confirm that stellar population correlates with stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma\_{\rm e}$ better than with stellar mass $M\_{\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies are more metal-poor at fixed $\sigma\_{\rm e}$. Stellar age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio $M\_{\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and lower $M\_{\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(\sigma\_{\rm e},\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients, consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $\sigma\_{\rm e}$, steep total mass-density slope, low dark matter fraction, high $M\_{\ast}/L$, and high metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are currently quenched. We discover a population of low-mass star-forming galaxies with low rotation but physically distinct from the massive slow rotators. A catalogue of the population properties is provided publicly.

2023-04-23, **MaNGA DynPop -- I. Quality-assessed stellar dynamical modelling from integral-field spectroscopy of 10K nearby galaxies: a catalogue of masses, mass-to-light ratios, density profiles and dark matter**, Kai Zhu et.al., [2304.11711v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11711v1)

 This is the first paper in our series on the combined analysis of the Dynamics and stellar Population (DynPop) for the MaNGA survey in the final SDSS Data Release 17 (DR17). Here we present a catalogue of dynamically-determined quantities for over 10000 nearby galaxies based on integral-field stellar kinematics from the MaNGA survey. The dynamical properties are extracted using the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which was previously shown to be the most accurate for this kind of study. We assess systematic uncertainties using eight dynamical models with different assumptions. We use two orientations of the velocity ellipsoid: either cylindrically-aligned JAM$\_{\rm cyl}$ or spherically-aligned JAM$\_{\rm sph}$. We also make four assumptions for the models' dark vs. luminous matter distributions: (1) mass-follows-light, (2) free NFW dark halo, (3) cosmologically-constrained NFW halo, (4) generalized NFW dark halo, i.e. with free inner slope. In this catalogue, we provide the quantities related to the mass distributions (e.g. the density slopes and enclosed mass within a sphere of a given radius for total mass, stellar mass, and dark matter mass components). We also provide the complete models which can be used to compute the full luminous and mass distribution of each galaxy. Additionally, we visually assess the qualities of the models to help with model selections. We estimate the observed scatter in the measured quantities which decreases as expected with improvements in quality. For the best data quality, we find a remarkable consistency of measured quantities between different models, highlighting the robustness of the results.

2023-04-23, **Diversity of Radial Spin Textures in Chiral Materials**, Daniel Gosálbez-Martínez et.al., [2304.11650v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11650v1)

 We introduce a classification of the radial spin textures in momentum space that emerge at high-symmetry points in crystals characterized by non-polar chiral point groups ($D\_2$, $D\_3$, $D\_4$, $D\_6$, $T$, $O$). Based on the symmetry constraints imposed by these point groups in a vector field, we study the general expression for the radial spin textures up to third order in momentum. Furthermore, we determine the high-symmetry points of the 45 non-polar chiral space groups supporting a radial spin texture. These two principles are used to screen materials databases for archetypes that go beyond the basic hedgehog radial spin texture. Among the selected materials we highlight the axion insulator candidate $\mathrm{Ta}\_2 \mathrm{Se}\_8\mathrm{I}$, the material proposed for dark matter detection $\mathrm{Ag}\_3\mathrm{Au}\mathrm{Te}\_2$ and heazlewoodite $\mathrm{Ni}\_3\mathrm{S}\_2$, a conventional metal predicted to exhibit current-induced spin polarization. We point out that the symmetry analysis proposed in this Letter is more general and extends to studying other vector properties in momentum space.

2023-04-23, **Reconstruction of an Observationally Constrained $f(R, T)$ gravity model**, Anirudh Pradhan et.al., [2304.11616v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11616v1)

 In this paper, an attempt is made to construct a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model in $f(R,T)$ gravity with a perfect fluid that yields acceleration at late times. We take $f(R,T)$ as $R$ + $8\pi \mu T$. As in the $\Lambda$CDM model, we take the matter to consist of two components, viz., $\Omega\_m$ and $\Omega\_{\mu}$ such that $\Omega\_m$ + $\Omega\_{\mu}$=1. The parameter $\Omega\_m$ is the matter density (baryons + dark matter), and $\Omega\_{\mu}$ is the density associated with the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace $T$ of the energy momentum tensor, which we shall call dominant matter. We find that at present $\Omega\_{\mu}$ is dominant over $\Omega\_m$, and that the two are in the ratio 3:1 to 3:2 according to the three data sets: (i) 77 Hubble OHD data set (ii) 580 SNIa supernova distance modulus data set and (iii) 66 pantheon SNIa data which include high red shift data in the range $0\leq z\leq 2.36$. We have also calculated the pressures and densities associated with the two matter densities, viz., $p\_{\mu}$, $\rho\_{\mu}$, $p\_m$ and $\rho\_m$, respectively. It is also found that at present, $\rho\_{\mu}$ is greater than $\rho\_m$. The negative dominant matter pressure $p\_{\mu}$ creates acceleration in the universe. Our deceleration and snap parameters show a change from negative to positive, whereas the jerk parameter is always positive. This means that the universe is at present accelerating and in the past it was decelerating. State finder diagnostics indicate that our model is at present a dark energy quintessence model. The various other physical and geometric properties of the model are also discussed.

2023-04-24, **Evolution of open clusters with or without black holes**, B. Shukirgaliyev et.al., [2304.12291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12291v1)

 Binary black holes (BHs) can be formed dynamically in the centers of star clusters. The high natal kicks for stellar-mass BHs used in previous works made it hard to retain BHs in star clusters. Recent studies of massive star evolution and supernovae (SN) propose kick velocities that are lower due to the fallback of the SN ejecta. We study the impact of these updates by performing $N$-body simulations following instantaneous gas expulsion. For comparison, we simulate two additional model sets with the previous treatment of stars: one with high kicks and another with artificial removal of the kicks. Our model clusters initially consist of about one hundred thousand stars, formed with centrally-peaked efficiency. We find that the updated treatment of stars, due to the fallback-scaled lower natal kicks, allows clusters to retain SN remnants after violent relaxation. The mass contribution of the retained remnants does not exceed a few percent of the total bound cluster mass during the early evolution. For this reason, the first giga year of evolution is not affected significantly by this effect. Nevertheless, during the subsequent long-term evolution, the retained BHs accelerate mass segregation, leading to the faster dissolution of the clusters.

2023-04-24, **Progenitor constraint with circumstellar material for the magnetar-hosting supernova remnant RCW 103**, Takuto Narita et.al., [2304.11819v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11819v1)

 Stellar winds blown out from massive stars ($\gtrsim 10M\_{\odot}$) contain precious information on the progenitor itself, and in this context, the most important elements are carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O), which are produced by the CNO cycle in the H-burning layer. Although their X-ray fluorescence lines are expected to be detected in swept-up shock-heated circumstellar materials (CSMs) in supernova remnants (SNRs), particularly those of C and N have been difficult to detect so far. Here, we present a high-resolution spectroscopy of a young magnetar-hosting SNR RCW~103 with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) onboard XMM-Newton and report on the detection of \ion{N}{7} Ly$\alpha$ (0.50~keV) line for the first time. By comparing the obtained abundance ratio of N to O (N/O$=3.8 \pm{0.1}$) with various stellar evolution models, we show that the progenitor of RCW~103 is likely to have a low-mass (10--12~$M\_{\odot}$) and medium-rotation velocities ($\lesssim 100~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$). The results also rule out the possibility of dynamo effects in massive ($\geq35~M\_{\odot}$) stars as a formation mechanism of the associated magnetar 1E~161348$-$5055. Our method is useful for estimating various progenitor parameters for future missions with microcalorimeters such as XRISM and Athena.

2023-04-23, **Observational constraints on two cosmological models of $f(Q)$ theory**, M. Koussour et.al., [2304.11765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11765v1)

 In the past few years, $f(Q)$ theories have drawn a lot of research attention in replacing Einstein's theory of gravity successfully. The current study examines the novel cosmological possibilities emerging from two specific classes of $f(Q)$ models using the parametrization form of the equation of state (EoS) parameter as $\omega \left( z\right) =-\frac{1}{1+3\beta \left( 1+z\right) ^{3}}$, which displays quintessence behavior with the evolution of the Universe. We do statistical analyses using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and background datasets like Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) luminosities and direct Hubble datasets (from cosmic clocks), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) datasets. This lets us compare these new ideas about the Universe to the $\Lambda $CDM model in a number of different possible ways. We have come to the conclusion that, at the current level of accuracy, the values of their specific parameters are the best fits for our $f(Q)$ models. To conclude the accelerating behavior of the Universe, we further study the evolution of energy density, pressure, and deceleration parameter for these $f(Q)$ models.

2023-04-23, **Reconstruction of an Observationally Constrained $f(R, T)$ gravity model**, Anirudh Pradhan et.al., [2304.11616v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11616v1)

 In this paper, an attempt is made to construct a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model in $f(R,T)$ gravity with a perfect fluid that yields acceleration at late times. We take $f(R,T)$ as $R$ + $8\pi \mu T$. As in the $\Lambda$CDM model, we take the matter to consist of two components, viz., $\Omega\_m$ and $\Omega\_{\mu}$ such that $\Omega\_m$ + $\Omega\_{\mu}$=1. The parameter $\Omega\_m$ is the matter density (baryons + dark matter), and $\Omega\_{\mu}$ is the density associated with the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace $T$ of the energy momentum tensor, which we shall call dominant matter. We find that at present $\Omega\_{\mu}$ is dominant over $\Omega\_m$, and that the two are in the ratio 3:1 to 3:2 according to the three data sets: (i) 77 Hubble OHD data set (ii) 580 SNIa supernova distance modulus data set and (iii) 66 pantheon SNIa data which include high red shift data in the range $0\leq z\leq 2.36$.

Our deceleration and snap parameters show a change from negative to positive, whereas the jerk parameter is always positive. This means that the universe is at present accelerating and in the past it was decelerating. State finder diagnostics indicate that our model is at present a dark energy quintessence model.

2023-04-23, **Anatomy of galactic star formation history: Roles of different modes of gas accretion, feedback, and recycling**, Masafumi Noguchi et.al., [2304.11581v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11581v1)

 We investigate how the diverse star formation histories observed across galaxy masses emerged using models that evolve under gas accretion from host halos. They also include ejection of interstellar matter by supernova feedback, recycling of ejected matter and preventive feedback that partially hinders gas accretion. We consider three schemes of gas accretion: the fiducial scheme which includes the accretion of cold gas in low-mass halos and high-redshift massive halos as hinted by cosmological simulations; the flat scheme in which high-mass cold accretion is removed; and finally the shock-heating scheme which assumes radiative cooling of the shock-heated halo gas. The fiducial scheme reproduces dramatic diminishment in star formation rate (SFR) after its peak as observed for the present halo mass $M\_{\rm vir}>10^{12.5}{\rm M}\_\odot$ while other two schemes show reduced or negligible quenching. This scheme reproduces the high-mass slope in the SFR vs. stellar mass relation decreasing toward recent epochs whereas other two schemes show opposite trend which contradicts observation. Success in the fiducial scheme originates in the existence of high-mass cold-mode accretion which retards transition to the slow hot-mode accretion thereby inducing a larger drop in SFR. Aided by gas recycling, which creates monotonically increasing SFR in low-mass halos, this scheme can reproduce the downsizing galaxy formation. Several issues remain, suggesting non-negligible roles of missing physics. Feedback from active galactic nuclei could mitigate upturn of SFR in low-redshift massive halos whereas galaxy mergers could remedy early inefficient star formation.
