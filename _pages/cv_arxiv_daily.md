2026-01-28, **Dark matter motivated sterile neutrino contribution to neutrinoless double beta decay**, Debashree Priyadarsini Das et.al., [2601.20356v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20356v1)

 The exact seesaw relation in a type-I seesaw framework puts constraints on the relations between active and sterile neutrino sectors in terms of their masses and mixing angles. In such a setup, we employ a model-independent approach to investigate the signature of sterile neutrinos in the half-life of the neutrinoless double beta ($0νββ$) decay process. In particular, we aim to study the contribution of sterile neutrinos in the mass range $\sim$~keV that is motivated by the dark matter constituent of the Universe. Further, the masses of the sterile neutrinos are determined by the active neutrino masses, mixing angles, and phases, and active-sterile mixing angles and $CP$-violating phases. The parameter space is constrained by the exact seesaw relation, thereby making the analysis constrained. After capturing the parameter space that can account for $\sim~$keV scale masses for the sterile neutrinos, we adopt the chiral effective field theory approach to calculate the half-life and effective mass in the $0νββ$ decay. As the study transitions from the TeV scale to scenarios involving at least one sterile neutrino in the keV mass range, it reveals a significant modification of the effective mass. In particular, the cancellation region associated with the normal mass hierarchy for TeV-scale sterile neutrinos no longer persists when a keV-scale sterile neutrino is introduced, resulting in a finite effective mass that future experiments can probe. Likewise, the involvement of keV-scale sterile neutrino in the inverted mass hierarchy case makes the band distorted and scattered points appear around the main band.

2026-01-28, **Mathematical Anatomy of Neutrino Decoherence in Red Turbulence: Fractional Calculus and Convergence of the Perturbative Series**, Yiwei Bao et.al., [2601.20313v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20313v1)

 We present a comprehensive study of perturbation theory for neutrino decoherence in power-law correlated turbulent matter, establishing rigorous convergence criteria and providing detailed numerical validation. Starting from the exact Laplace-space solution derived from the generalized master equation with memory kernel $K(t) \propto t^{-ν}e^{-t/τ\_c}$, we develop a systematic perturbation expansion in the turbulence strength parameter $ξ$. The expansion is performed around the high-density matter basis where $\cos 2θ\_m \approx 1$, rather than the vacuum basis, reflecting the physical conditions in supernova cores. We obtain explicit expressions for the first few perturbation terms and derive the general structure of higher-order terms, which involve Mittag-Leffler functions that emerge from the fractional dynamics. Using high-precision numerical methods (multiple-precision arithmetic and asymptotic expansions), we analyze the convergence radius and rate of the perturbation series. We find that for $ξ< ξ\_c \approx 0.8$, the series converges with error decreasing geometrically. For $ξ= 0.16$ (typical supernova conditions), third-order perturbation theory achieves $\sim 1\%$ accuracy. We provide practical guidelines for applying perturbation theory to realistic astrophysical scenarios and validate all analytical results with extensive numerical computations. Our work clarifies several subtle aspects of the perturbative approach that were not addressed in the original literature, offering a complete toolkit for researchers studying neutrino-turbulence interactions. In particular, we systematically address the ultraviolet divergence of the correlation function at short time scales for spectral indices $ν\geq 1$, introducing a physical small-scale cutoff regularization that ensures mathematical rigor for the fractional master equation and perturbative expansion.

2026-01-27, **POEMMA-Balloon with Radio: A multi-messenger, multi-detector balloon payload**, J. Adams et.al., [2601.19997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19997v1)

 A review of the current status of the field of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) including a summary of remaining open questions was presented in the white paper "Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays: at the Intersection of the Cosmic and Energy Frontiers" (Astropart. Phys. 147 (2023) 102794; arXiv:2205.05845). The authors concluded that two types of next-generation detectors are needed to answer these questions: high-accuracy instruments and detectors that maximize exposure at the highest energies. The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA), a proposed dual-satellite observatory, exemplifies the latter class and is designed to increase statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and to detect very-high-energy neutrinos following multi-messenger alerts. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) implements a compact, balloon-borne version of the POEMMA concept, adapted for a Super-Pressure Balloon flight from Wanaka, New Zealand, with an expected campaign exceeding 20 days. PBR couples a wide field-of-view Schmidt telescope and a hybrid optical focal surface with a dedicated radio instrument to deliver simultaneous, complementary measurements of extensive air showers. The mission will validate the fluorescence detection strategy from space and raise technology readiness for a POEMMA-like space mission by observing UHECR-induced fluorescence light from suborbital altitudes, obtaining the first simultaneous optical Cherenkov and radio observations of high-altitude horizontal air showers above the cosmic-ray knee (E>3PeV), enabling energy-spectrum and composition studies at the PeV scale, and performing follow-ups of multi-messenger alerts to search for very-high-energy neutrinos via upward-going air showers. This paper summarizes the PBR payload and its expected performance.

2026-01-27, **A Comprehensive Effective Field Theory Framework for Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering**, Gang Li et.al., [2601.19883v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19883v1)

 Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$ν$NS) stands out as a pivotal process for precision tests of the Standard Model electroweak sector, investigations of neutrino properties, and searches for new physics (NP). Recent experimental measurements by COHERENT, CONUS+, and ton-scale xenon detectors--including PandaX-4T and XENONnT--underscore the need for a systematic theoretical framework to bridge high-energy physics scenarios with low-energy observational data. In this work, we develop a comprehensive end-to-end effective field theory (EFT) framework for CE$ν$NS, encompassing the complete energy scale hierarchy spanning the ultraviolet (UV) regime down to the nuclear sector. We consider the low-energy EFT (LEFT) operators up to dimension 8, incorporating their QCD renormalization group running effects, and employ the systematic spurion method to achieve the matching between these operators and the chiral Lagrangian. A full power counting analysis is performed, extending to nuclear response functions, which evaluates contributions from LEFT operators up to dimension 8 while accounting for the nucleon number enhancement effect intrinsic to CE$ν$NS. Moreover, we match the relevant LEFT operators for CE$ν$NS onto operators up to dimension 8 within the Standard Model EFT. By also providing their complete tree-level ultraviolet completions, this procedure establishes a consistent top-down theoretical workflow. Leveraging a broad suite of CE$ν$NS experimental data, this framework enables a combined analysis to extract constraints on the scales of EFT operators and neutrino non-standard interaction parameters.

2026-01-27, **Probing Solar Neutrino Deficit via Torsion-Induced Flavor Change in f(T) Gravity**, H. Yazdani Ahmadabadi et.al., [2601.19550v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19550v1)

 We investigate whether the spacetime torsion can modify neutrino flavor oscillations in f(T) gravity. This offers a probe of modified teleparallel gravity in astrophysical environments. By using the Dirac action in teleparallel geometry, we derive an effective coupling between the torsion vector and neutrino current. In the weak-field limit around a spherical mass, we obtain analytical expressions for torsion-induced phase shifts and effective mass-squared differences. Our results indicate that both vacuum oscillations and the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance in matter are affected by these torsion-based modifications. Using solar neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande, SNO, Borexino, and KamLAND, we constrain the teleparallel model parameters and also the neutrino-torsion coupling.

2026-01-27, **Radiative Dirac neutrino masses and dark matter in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended model**, Chayan Majumdar et.al., [2601.19454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19454v1)

 We study a $U(1)\_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model (SM) in which Dirac neutrino masses are generated radiatively at the one-loop level through the exchange of new beyond the SM fields. This framework establishes a direct connection between neutrino mass generation and the dark sector, with the stability of the dark matter ensured by a residual discrete $Z\_6$ symmetry arising from the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)\_{B-L}$. We investigate the resulting charged lepton flavor violating processes and dark matter phenomenology, saturating relic observations and direct-detection constraints, and analyze the collider signatures of the dark sector at the Large Hadron Collider and at a future muon collider. We have identified excellent prospects for observing the considered dark matter candidates in these colliders, even with lower integrated luminosities than the proposed one.

2026-01-27, **Predictions of effective Majorana neutrino mass under radiative corrections to $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry**, Prokash Pegu et.al., [2601.19419v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19419v1)

 The search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0νββ$) is currently one of the key objectives in neutrino physics research. The decay rate of $0νββ$ decay depends on the effective Majorana neutrino mass $\|\langle m \rangle\_{ee}\|$. In this work we study the numerical prediction of $\|\langle m \rangle\_{ee}\|$ in the scenario of deviation from the $μ$-$τ$ reflection symmetry due to radiative corrections, as an extension of our earlier work \cite{pegu}. In \cite{pegu}, we consider an exact $μ$-$τ$ reflection symmetry in the light effective Majorana neutrino mass matrix and in the corresponding lepton mixing matrix as well at the seesaw scale. We choose numerical values of all the mixing parameters and neutrino mass eigenvalues at the seesaw scale as inputs and estimate the values of mass eigenvalues and mixing parameters at the electroweak scale due to radiative corrections. We find these low energy predictions consistent with global $3σ$ oscillation data. In the present work, we compute the effective Majorana neutrino mass $\|\langle m \rangle\_{ee}\|$ using these low energy values at the electroweak scale. We find that the low energy predictions of $\|\langle m \rangle\_{ee}\|$ are consistent with the latest upper bound $\|\langle m \rangle\_{ee}\|<(0.028-0.122)\ eV$ provided by KamLAND-Zen Collaboration.

2026-01-27, **Analysing Toponium at the LHC using Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction**, Aman Desai et.al., [2601.19187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19187v1)

 Recent results from the ATLAS and the CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider indicate the presence of a top-quark pair bound state near the threshold region. We present a way to reconstruct a toponium state at the $t\bar{t}$ threshold region formed at the Large Hadron Collider using the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction. We have considered the Non-Relativistic QCD based toponium model implemented in MadGraph5\\_aMC@NLO. The final states considered consist of two b-jets, two oppositely charged leptons, and missing energy that arises from two neutrinos. The goal of the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction is to make use of rules that can help resolve combinatorics ambiguity in preparing the decay tree for a given physics event. Additionally, missing energy coming from two neutrinos needs to be resolved in order to reconstruct the event. We apply four different methods within the RestFrames package and compare the reconstruction results resulting from each of the methods. Due to this method, one can also access kinematic variables in the rest frames belonging to intermediate particle states, providing additional means to discriminate the SM $\ttbar$ background from the toponium signal. We propose using two angular variables to enhance sensitivity to the toponium signal. Our preliminary results indicate that the improvement in sensitivity can be as much as 16\% over the current strategy in the LHC's Run 3 configuration. This method may be useful for gaining additional insight into the physics phenomenology in the $\ttbar$ threshold region.

2026-01-27, **Development of a comprehensive PMT optical model for the JUNO experiment**, Y. Ren et.al., [2601.19081v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19081v1)

 There are 17,612 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) installed at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). Developing a precise optical model for the PMTs is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of detector simulations and refining the energy response model at JUNO. In this study, we established a comprehensive PMT optical model based on prior studies, taking into account the non-uniformity of photon detection efficiency (PDE) across the PMT surface and the variances in PDE as well as reflections among different PMTs. By collecting reflectance data from 669 PMTs and utilizing PDE data from mass testing systems, we estimated the thickness maps of the photocathode (PC) and the anti-reflective coating (ARC) for each PMT. We also determined the collection efficiency (CE) by decomposing PDE with consideration of the optical processes occurring within the PMTs. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of both the PC and ARC, along with the escape factor, were evaluated over a broad wavelength range of 300~nm to 700~nm, covering the entire spectrum of interest for JUNO. Compared to the prediction from a simplified PMT optical model, which assumes uniform PC and ARC across all PMTs of the same type, the further developed PMT optical model yields much more reflectance for HPK PMTs and less for NNVT PMTs, and the change in PDE is at the level of a few percent. This comprehensive PMT optical model also provides a valuable reference for other PMT-based applications.

2026-01-28, **Euclid preparation. Galaxy power spectrum modelling in redshift space**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2601.20826v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20826v1)

 Accurate modelling of redshift-space distortions (RSD) is essential for maximizing the cosmological information extracted from large galaxy redshift surveys. In preparation for the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic data, we investigate three approaches to modelling RSD effects on the power spectrum multipoles of mock H$α$ emission line galaxies. We focus on two one-loop perturbation theory models -- the effective field theory (EFT) and velocity difference generator (${\rm VDG\_ \infty}$) -- which differ in their treatment of the real-to-redshift space mapping on small scales, and a third approach, the BACCO emulator, which adopts a hybrid strategy combining perturbation theory with high-resolution N-body simulations. We assess the ability of these models to recover key cosmological parameters, including the expansion rate $h$, the cold dark matter density parameter $ω\_{\rm c}$, and the scalar amplitude $A\_{\rm s}$, across four redshift bins spanning $0.9 \leq z \leq 1.8$. In each bin, we find that ${\rm VDG\_ \infty}$ and BACCO outperform the EFT model across all scales up to $k\_{max} \lesssim 0.35 h\,Mpc^{-1} $. While BACCO saturates in constraining power at intermediate scales and higher redshift, the ${\rm VDG\_ \infty}$ model continues to improve parameter constraints beyond $k\_{max} \gtrsim 0.30 h\,Mpc^{-1}$. The EFT model, although robust on large scales, exhibits significant parameter biases for $k\_{max} \gtrsim 0.25 h\,Mpc^{-1}$, limiting its applicability to Euclid-like H$α$ samples. Among the full perturbation theory-based models, the enhanced treatment of small-scale RSD effects in ${\rm VDG\_ \infty}$ improves cosmological parameter constraints by up to a factor of two.

2026-01-28, **How well is the local Large Scale Structure of the Universe known? CosmicFlows vs. Biteau's Galaxy Catalog with Cloning**, Yifei Li et.al., [2601.20808v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20808v1)

 Knowledge of the actual density distribution of matter in the local universe is needed for a variety of purposes -- for instance, as a baseline model for ultrahigh energy cosmic ray sources in the continuum limit and for predicting the diffuse Dark Matter annihilation signal. Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies. Here, we compare the density field proposed by Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (Valade 2026). We find factor-two level differences in some regions and even greater in regions toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA) (\|l\| < 30°, \|b\| < 20°) as filled by Biteau using "cloning". Within 11 Mpc the density field is well-determined by the Local Volume catalog (Karachentsev et al. 2018) which Biteau directly incorporates; at larger distances, Biteau (2021) should not be used in the ZoA where "galaxies" are entirely fictitious but otherwise is to be preferred over CosmicFlows emphasizing the direction and integrated mass of structures; the radial distribution of mass in Biteau (2021) is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities. The angular positions of structures in CosmicFlows are sometimes not congruent with evidence in the galaxy catalog.

2026-01-28, **Graviton energy spectra arising from the KSVZ axion model**, Yonghua Wang et.al., [2601.20767v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20767v1)

 Axion, the goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry, provides a dynamical solution to the strong CP problem and is an excellent dark matter candidate. Various experiments are designed to search for the axion, however no confirmative signal has been observed. On the other hand, there are also hypothetical heavy particles in axion models, such as the heavy scalar $s$, which is the CP-even component of the complex scalar that carries $U(1)\_{PQ}$ charge, and the vector-like heavy quark (VLQ) in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov~(KSVZ) axion model. Studying signals induced by them are helpful for axion searches. In this paper, we calculate the graviton bremsstrahlung energy spectrum arising from the decay of the heavy scalar or VLQ in the KSVZ model. The result shows that these heavy particles can emit ultrahigh-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), with the peak frequency depending on the model's parameter inputs. In addition, the graviton spectrum is distinguished from the thermal GW background at high frequencies if there is an early matter-dominated era induced by these heavy particles. Future measurements of ultrahigh-frequency GWs may provide indirect evidence for the KSVZ axion.

2026-01-28, **Trigger Optimization and Event Classification for Dark Matter Searches in the CYGNO Experiment Using Machine Learning**, F. D. Amaro et.al., [2601.20626v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20626v1)

 The CYGNO experiment employs an optical-readout Time Projection Chamber (TPC) to search for rare low-energy interactions using finely resolved scintillation images. While the optical readout provides rich topological information, it produces large, sparse megapixel images that challenge real-time triggering, data reduction, and background discrimination.   We summarize two complementary machine-learning approaches developed within CYGNO. First, we present a fast and fully unsupervised strategy for online data reduction based on reconstruction-based anomaly detection. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images (i.e. frames acquired with GEM amplification disabled) learns the detector noise morphology and highlights particle-induced structures through localized reconstruction residuals, from which compact Regions of Interest (ROIs) are extracted. On real prototype data, the selected configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with ~25 ms per-frame inference time on a consumer GPU.   Second, we report a weakly supervised application of the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) framework to data acquired with an Americium--Beryllium neutron source. Using only mixed AmBe and standard datasets (no event-level labels), a convolutional classifier learns to identify nuclear-recoil-like topologies. The achieved performance approaches the theoretical limit imposed by the mixture composition and isolates a high-score population with compact, approximately circular morphologies consistent with nuclear recoils.

2026-01-28, **Revealing the link between halo mass and radio jet activities in quasars**, B. -H. Yue et.al., [2601.20576v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20576v1)

 There is a fundamental lack of understanding as to why quasars that are otherwise very similar can have such a wide range of radio jet powers, and the large-scale environment is thought to play an important role. We investigate the spatial clustering properties of 225,382 quasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) within the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 footprint, split by the statistically-calculated fraction of their radio flux densities contributed by jets (relative to the contribution from star formation). We find a positive correlation between the clustering strengths of quasars and their jet fraction, where quasars with a higher jet fraction have a higher clustering amplitude measured by their two-point correlation functions. We show that this correlation is unlikely related to differences in BH masses or bolometric luminosities. Quasars dominated by powerful jet activities generally reside in dark matter haloes $10-100$ times more massive than those without strong jets, with typical halo masses of $10^{13-14}\ h^{-1}M\_\odot$, establishing a robust link between powerful AGN jets and rich cluster environments. Our results demonstrate that halo mass is important for determining the power of radio jets, but suggest that there is no minimum dark matter halo mass or BH mass required for the triggering of jets. The observed correlation suggests that BH spin is likely to play a minor role in jet production; instead, the key driver could be the presence of a strong magnetic flux.

2026-01-28, **Pathology of the Unified Dark Sectors in Modified General Relativity**, Mohsen Khodadi et.al., [2601.20530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20530v1)

 This paper presents a comprehensive stability analysis of the black hole solution within Modified General Relativity (MGR), a theory proposing a unified geometric description of dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR).

2026-01-28, **Optimising Re-entrant Cavity Designs for Low Mass Axion Haloscopes**, Raj Aryan Singh et.al., [2601.20151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20151v1)

 Axion haloscopes provide a leading experimental approach to detecting QCD axion dark matter through resonant axion-photon conversion in microwave cavities. Extending haloscope sensitivity to low axion masses remains challenging due to the large resonator volumes required at sub-GHz frequencies. Re-entrant cavities offer a compact solution, but their performance depends strongly on geometric optimisation. We present a comprehensive finite-element study of re-entrant cavity haloscope designs operating in the 100 to 500 MHz range, comparing their performance using effective scan time as a figure of merit. Among the configurations studied, we identify a double attack geometry that achieves a roughly threefold improvement in effective scan time compared to a conventional single-rod re-entrant cavity. We further investigate practical implementation strategies, including a hybrid design employing one fixed rod and one tunable rod, which preserves a scan time gain while reducing mechanical complexity. These results demonstrate a pathway to enhanced low-mass axion haloscope sensitivity.

2026-01-27, **An Analytic Scale-dependent Dark Matter Profile and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation**, V. K. Oikonomou et.al., [2601.20070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20070v1)

 In this work we use the recently introduced concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, and we provide an analytic model of dark matter that can produce viable rotation curves even for low-surface-brightness galaxies, irregular galaxies, low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies, all known to challenge the cold dark matter description. The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{ρ(r)}{ρ\_{\star}}\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $ρ(r)=\frac{ρ\_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{α^2}\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\frac{K\_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{α^2}\right)^{1/2}}$. The resulting model is confronted in detail with the SPARC galaxy data and 175 galaxies are used and tested. It proves that the analytic model can successfully produce the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, most of which are small mass spirals, irregular galaxies, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, 59 galaxies cannot be successfully described by our analytic model. We tested statistically the correlation between the parameter $K\_0$ of the entropy function corresponding to the viable galaxies, and the flat rotation velocity $V\_{flat}$ and the maximum rotation velocity $V\_{max}$ of the galaxies from the SPARC data. We also examined the baryon mass $M\_b$-$K\_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K\_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K\_0$-$M\_b$ and $K\_0$-$V\_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M\_b\sim V\_{flat}^{4.026 \pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation.

2026-01-27, **Prompt cusps in hierarchical dark matter halos: Implications for annihilation boost**, Shin'ichiro Ando et.al., [2601.19863v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19863v1)

 Recent simulations have identified long-lived ``prompt cusps'' -- compact remnants of early density peaks with inner profiles $ρ\propto r^{-3/2}$. They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B\_{\rm sh}\sim\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M\_{\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about an order of magnitude, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence.

2026-01-27, **Testing the Equivalence Principle in Galaxy Clusters**, Enea Di Dio et.al., [2601.19861v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19861v1)

 Clusters of galaxies have been used to measure a subtle effect predicted by Einstein: gravitational redshift. This signal encodes pristine information about our Universe, since it is sensitive to the depth of the clusters' gravitational potential wells. In this work, we show how gravitational redshift can be used to test a fundamental physical principle: the weak equivalence principle. This principle stipulates that all matter falls in the same way in a gravitational potential, regardless of its nature. By comparing the amplitude of the gravitational redshift signal with the velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters, we build a novel test of this principle targeted to the unknown dark matter. Our test is sensitive to any additional interaction that would alter the way dark matter falls in gravitational potentials, hence leading to a violation of the equivalence principle. We show that currently available data can constrain the presence of a fifth force in clusters at the level of 7-14%, while the newest surveys will reach a precision of a few percents. This demonstrates the crucial role played by galaxy clusters in testing fundamental properties of dark matter.

2026-01-27, **Oscillating Resonances: Imprints of ultralight dark matter at colliders**, Martin Bauer et.al., [2601.19844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19844v1)

 In models where ultralight fields constitute dark matter, the misalignment mechanism leads to coherent, low-amplitude oscillations in fundamental constants. This effect arises from effective operators that couple dark matter to Standard Model fields. We present different models that can induce these effective operators by integrating out a mediator field. For mediator masses within the reach of collider searches, an alternative way to discover ultralight dark matter is to search for a resonance. Due to being a mediator to dark matter, the mass of the mediator oscillates. The resonance therefore, should not appear as a single isolated peak, but is smeared out once data is averaged over an oscillation cycle or more. Remarkably, the oscillation period and amplitude are in the range of current and future collider searches, even though constraints from atomic clocks probing variations of the fine-structure constant and the electron mass are very strong. We recast existing searches and projections from Belle II, LHCb and SHiP for an `oscillating resonance', and discuss how the periodicity of the signal can be used to reconstruct the peak from mass-binned data. We further show that time-stamped data would allow to unfold the signal via a fast Fourier transform and determine the significance of the signal for different background levels. The discovery of an oscillating resonance at a collider, with characteristics as predicted in ultralight dark matter scenarios, would constitute a powerful probe of dark matter's underlying nature.

2026-01-27, **A study of dark matter-dark energy interaction under the DESI DR2 data constraint**, Amin Aboubrahim et.al., [2601.19662v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19662v1)

 While $Λ$CDM provides a good fit to cosmological data, it fails to address many of the outstanding questions in contemporary cosmology. Chief among these are the Hubble tension and the apparent dynamical nature of dark energy as inferred from the recent DESI DR2 analysis. In this work, we analyze a field-theoretic description of cosmology where both dark energy and dark matter are interacting spin zero fields. We give a thorough study of a wide range of the interaction strength and demonstrate the effect on the dark energy equation of state and the Hubble tension. Using the recent cosmological data, we extract constraints on cosmological parameters including the free parameters of the model.

2026-01-27, **Q-balls from thermal balls during a first-order phase transition: a numerical study**, Yuan-Jie Li et.al., [2601.19150v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19150v1)

 We numerically study the Q-ball formation triggered by a cosmological first-order phase transition within the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. By performing lattice simulations, we track the nonequilibrium dynamics throughout the transition, providing a precise description of the Q-ball formation mechanism and the resulting mass spectrum. Collapsing false-vacuum regions first form thermal balls, which subsequently cool via dissipative interactions and stabilize into long-lived Q-balls with nonzero spin. We observe a large population of low-mass Q-balls, as well as rare, massive Q-balls that are several times larger than the analytical prediction. The final Q-ball population exhibits a broad mass spectrum spanning over two orders of magnitude, characterized by an exponential tail of number density at large masses. The simulations suggest that the Q-ball abundance is approximately $50\%$ higher than predicted by analytical estimates, adjusting the result in the context of Q-balls as dark matter candidates.

 A mildly inhomogeneous universe with a cosmological constant may look like it contains evolving dark energy. We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant.

2026-01-28, **Probing the Diversity of Type Ia Supernova Remnants in 3-D Hydrodynamic Simulations with X-ray Spectral Synthesis**, Yusei Fujimaru et.al., [2601.20446v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20446v1)

 Type Ia supernovae (SNe), thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in binary systems, are widely used as standard candles owing to the empirical width-luminosity relation of their light curves. Recent theoretical and observational studies indicate a diversity of progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms. In the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, the diversity in Fe-K$α$ centroid energies and line luminosities suggests variations in the underlying explosion mechanisms. X-ray spectra of SNRs, which trace shocked ejecta and the surrounding medium, are crucial diagnostics of progenitor systems and explosion physics. Thanks to recent advances in spectroscopy with XRISM, high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy enables 3-D diagnostics, including line-of-sight velocities. In this study, we perform 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs from six Type Ia explosion models: two each of pure deflagration, delayed detonation, and double detonation. Each model is evolved for 1000 years in a uniform medium, consistently accounting for non-equilibrium ionization. Our efficient numerical scheme enables systematic parameter surveys in full 3-D. From these models, we synthesize X-ray spectra with $\sim$1 eV resolution, exceeding XRISM/Resolve's spectral resolution. This work presents the first calculation of X-ray spectra for Type Ia SNRs derived from 3-D hydrodynamic simulations that follow the evolution self-consistently from the SN phase into the SNR phase. Our results show inter-model diversity in the X-ray spectra. Asymmetric, red- and blueshifted line profiles arise from the 3-D ejecta distributions. These findings demonstrate that 3-D SNR modeling can reproduce the observed diversity of Type Ia SNRs and provide qualitative constraints on progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms.

2026-01-28, **Gamma-ray Emission from the S147 Region: Indication of Escaping Cosmic Rays Interacting with Molecular Clouds**, Huan Yang et.al., [2601.20210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20210v1)

 We present a detailed analysis of $γ$-ray emission from the middle-aged supernova remnant (SNR) S147 (G180.0$-$1.7) using approximately 16.5 years of Fermi-LAT data. Spatially, a new extended $γ$-ray component distinct from the emission associated with the H$α$ filaments of the SNR shell is identified. This new component exhibits a strong spatial correlation with dense molecular clouds (MCs) identified in CO emission at Local Standard of Rest velocities of $0$-$5\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Spectrally, the cloud-associated emission implies an underlying cosmic-ray (CR) proton population described by a hard power law with an index of $Γ\approx 2.1$, compatible with the standard diffusive shock acceleration prediction. We interpret the $γ$-ray emission in this region with a hadronic scenario involving two distinct CR populations: trapped CRs reaccelerated within the radiative SNR shell as proposed in previous work, and escaping CRs illuminating the nearby MCs. The derived CR proton intensity in the MC region significantly exceeds the local Galactic background measured by AMS-02, strongly suggesting that the cloud is illuminated by particles accelerated by S147. These findings provide observational evidence for CR escape during the earlier evolutionary phases of this middle-aged SNR and highlight S147 as a promising candidate for detection at TeV energies by LHAASO.

2026-01-27, **Asymmetrical thermonuclear supernovae triggered by the tidal disruption of white dwarfs**, Pavan Vynatheya et.al., [2601.20133v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20133v1)

 In a dense star cluster core, a tidal disruption event (TDE) of a white dwarf (WD) can occur if the WD passes within the tidal radius of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Very close encounters cause extreme tidal compression in the WD, raising temperatures enough to induce runaway fusion and produce a thermonuclear supernova (SN). Using the hydrodynamics code AREPO augmented with a 55-isotope nuclear reaction network, we performed high-resolution simulations of the TDE of a $0.6$ Msun C/O WD by a $500$ Msun IMBH for different values of the scaled impact parameter $b$ (i.e., the ratio of periapsis distance to tidal radius). Closer encounters produce combined TDE+SN events, with a partial burning of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O into heavier isotopes -- the $^{56}$Ni fractions of the disrupted WD material vary from 1% at $b = 0.19$ to 82% at $b = 0.10$, while wider ones ($b \gtrsim 0.20$) lead to standard TDEs. In all cases, the material away from the denser regions remains unburnt, spanning a wide range of radial velocities. Such WD TDEs also exhibit a central cavity, wherein little material is found below a radial velocity of several $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$. We also performed 1D and 2D radiative-transfer calculations for these WD-TDEs using the codes CMFGEN and LONGPOL, respectively, covering epochs from a few days to one hundred days. We recover the typical rise times and peak luminosities of SNe Ia, but with an extremely strong viewing-angle dependence of both light curves and spectra. At nebular times, isolated strong emission lines like [Ca ii] λλ 7291, 7323 may appear both displaced and skewed by many $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$ -- such extreme offsets are harder to identify at earlier times due to optical depth effects and line overlap. WD TDEs may produce a diverse set of transients with extreme asymmetry and peculiar composition.

2026-01-27, **GLIMPSE-DDT spectroscopic properties of faint-end galaxies at $z\sim6$: Towards first metal enrichment, dust production, and ionizing photon production**, Yoshihisa Asada et.al., [2601.20045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20045v1)

 Ultra-faint galaxies at high-$z$ are fundamental elements of the early galaxy assembly, and spectroscopic characterization of this population is essential to understand the earliest galaxy evolution. Leveraging the ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a gravitational lensing field of Abell S1063, taken as part of the GLIMPSE survey, we present spectroscopic properties of 16 galaxies fainter than $M\_{\rm UV}=-17$ mag, including the metallicity, dust attenuation, and the ionizing photon production efficiency. The emission lines are generally quite strong, roughly half of which cannot be replicated with standard stellar populations and require an extreme ionizing source. We also identify relatively strong [OIII] emission lines from all sample galaxies, which indicates that the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation is extended down to $M\_\star\sim10^6\ M\_\odot$ at $z\sim6$. The strong [OIII] line detection from the lowest-mass galaxy among the sample ($M\_\star\sim10^{5.6}\ M\_\odot$) stands in contrast to recent reports of extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates at similar mass and redshift, suggesting that there could be two distinct pathways of the earliest metal enrichment as simulations have predicted. Interestingly, we detect both dust attenuation and galactic outflow in one of the sample galaxies with $M\_\star=10^{6.6}\ M\_\odot$ at $z=5.5$. All the dust, metal, and outflow contents in this galaxy can be consistently explained by supernovae (SNe), indicative of the key roles of SNe in the earliest galaxy assembly such as dust production, metal enrichment, stellar feedback, and baryon cycle.

2026-01-27, **Fading Echoes of Interaction: Probing Centuries of Mass-Loss in Four Old Type IIn Supernovae**, Elizabeth Hillenkamp et.al., [2601.19891v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19891v1)

 Supernovae characterized by enduring narrow optical hydrogen emission lines (SNe IIn) are believed to result primarily from the core-collapse of massive stars undergoing sustained interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). While the properties of SN IIn progenitors have relatively few direct constraints, the ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction provides unique information about late-stage stellar mass-loss preceding core-collapse. We present late-time X-ray and radio observations of four $\geq$3000 day-old SNe IIn: SN 2013L, SN 2014ab, SN 2015da, and KISS15s. The radio and X-ray emission from KISS15s indicate a mass-loss rate of $\rm{\dot M\sim4\times 10^{-3}~{M\_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\sim$450 years pre-supernova -- 2 orders of magnitude below earlier optical estimates (which probed the mass-loss immediately preceding the supernova). We find hints of a spectral inversion in the radio SED of KISS15s; a possible signature of a secondary shock due to a binary system or the emergence of a pulsar wind. For SN 2013L, we obtain a mass-loss rate of $\rm{\dot M\sim2 \times 10^{-3}~\rm{M\_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\sim$400 years pre-explosion based on the X-ray detection. For SN 2014ab and SN 2015da, we find a upper limits on the mass-loss rates of $\rm{\dot M<2\times10^{-3}~M\_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ explosion at $\sim$ 250 and 300 years pre-explosion, respectively. All four objects display mass-loss rates lower than estimates from earlier optical analyses by at least 1-3 orders of magnitude, necessitating a rapidly evolving progenitor process over the last centuries pre-explosion. Our analysis reveals how X-ray and radio observations can elucidate progenitor evolution when these objects have faded at optical wavelengths.

2026-01-27, **Union3.1: Self-consistent Measurements of Host Galaxy Properties for 2000 Type Ia Supernovae**, Taylor J. Hoyt et.al., [2601.19424v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19424v1)

 The determination of distances using time-series photometry of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) relies on a ~5% empirical correction related to the properties of their host galaxies, e.g., global stellar mass. It is therefore crucial for unbiased cosmology inference that host galaxy properties be self-consistently determined across the full range of redshifts probed, which we undertake in this study for approximately 2000 SNe in the Union3 compilation (now Union3.1). We use aperture-matched, homogeneously-reduced, optical-infrared photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys to derive global galaxy properties using the stellar population synthesis and SED-fitting code Prospector. We find that the host masses of $z<0.10$ SNe in Union3 were, on average, overestimated relative to the rest of the sample, while the opposite was true for $z<0.15$ SNe in Pantheon+. After correction, the two studies' average distance modulus estimated for low-redshift SNe, previously $>0.03$ mag discrepant, come into 0.01 mag agreement. We then update the UNITY SN analysis and find that the uncertainties on all standardization parameters shrink to 0.6-0.9x their previous sizes. For flat-$Λ$CDM, we find $Ω\_m=0.344^{+0.026}\_{-0.025}$, a -0.3$σ$ shift from Union3. We then combine with measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) exactly as done by DESI DR2 and find $w\_0=-0.719\pm0.084$, $w\_a=-0.95^{+0.29}\_{-0.26}$, corresponding to 3.4$σ$ evidence against a cosmological constant (down from 3.8$σ$). We also update the DESI combined probe analysis using our correction to Pantheon+ and the recent DES-SN5YR Dovekie recalibration, finding $3.2σ$ (up from 2.8$σ$) and 3.4$σ$ (down from 4.2$σ$) evidence against a cosmological constant in the $w\_0w\_a$ plane, altogether marking a significantly improved consistency across SN analyses.
