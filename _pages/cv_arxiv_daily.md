2025-06-12, **Impact of improved energy resolution on DUNE sensitivity in presence of a light sterile neutrino**, Sabila Parveen et.al., [2506.10767v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10767v1)

 The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) primarily aims to measure the yet unknown parameters of the standard three neutrino framework, i.e., the determination of Dirac CP phase ($\delta\_{13}$), neutrino mass hierarchy (MH) and octant of $\theta\_{23}$. In the present work, we consider the standard three neutrino paradigm (referred to as the $(3+0)$ case) and beyond with an additional light sterile neutrino (referred to as the $(3+1)$ case). We consider two configurations : standard energy resolution as in DUNE Technical Design Report (TDR) and improved energy resolution and study the impact of energy resolution in the $(3+0)$ and $(3+1)$ cases. In general, inclusion of subdominant new physics effects spoils the sensitivities. However, improved energy resolution leads to enhancement in sensitivities to the three unknowns in both $(3+0)$ and $(3+1)$ cases.

2025-06-12, **Evading Dark Matter Bounds through NLSP-Assisted Freeze-Out with Long-Lived Signatures**, Sarif Khan et.al., [2506.10618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10618v1)

 In this work, we explore a conversion-driven freeze-out scenario, where the next-to-lightest stable particle (NLSP) sets the dark matter (DM) abundance through the process ``NLSP SM $\leftrightarrow$ DM SM". Although DM is produced via a freeze-out mechanism, its interaction strength with the visible sector can range from weak to feeble couplings. This results in a vast, largely unexplored parameter space that evades current direct, indirect, and collider bounds, while remaining testable in the near future. We study this mechanism in the context of an alternative $U(1)\_{B-L}$ model, where four chiral fermions are required to cancel gauge anomalies, unlike the usual case with three right-handed neutrinos. The observed relic abundance is successfully reproduced within this framework. The viable parameter space can be probed by future direct detection experiments, while remaining inaccessible to indirect searches. Our results show that the DM relic density is highly sensitive to the NLSP-SM interaction strength and the mass difference between the NLSP and DM, but not to the DM-SM direct interaction. For certain parameter choices, the NLSP decays to DM via two or three body processes involving an extra gauge boson and SM particles, leading to long-lived decays outside the CMS or ATLAS detectors at the LHC. In contrast, if the decay proceeds via a CP-odd Higgs, it occurs promptly within the detector. We investigate prospects for detecting such long-lived NLSPs at the proposed MATHUSLA detector, with similar expectations for the ongoing FASER experiment. Finally, we find that choosing arbitrarily small values of the gauge coupling or BSM fermionic mixing angle can violate successful BBN predictions.

2025-06-12, **Impact of angle-dependent recombination on neutrino energy reconstruction in LArTPCs**, J. Vences et.al., [2506.10551v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10551v1)

 The technology of Liquid Argon Time-Projection Chambers (LArTPC) plays a very important role in modern neutrino physics. It allows precise tracking and calorimetry in detectors with very large volume and mass. One important component of LArTPC calorimetric energy reconstruction is the electron-ion recombination effect.   Existing experiments have provided constraints to its empirical description, including an explicit dependence on the particle's angle with respect to the TPC's electric field.   In this paper we analyze the impact of angle-dependent recombination models on the reconstruction of neutrino energy in LArTPCs. We examine in detail the predictions of the existing models, showing that there is still considerable uncertainty for the angular dependence prediction at the low values of $dE/dx$ typical of minimum ionizing particles. We apply a simple correction to overcome unphysical predictions in the non-constrained energy loss regions and evaluate the consequences of that in the bias and linearity of electron neutrino energy responses, using generator-level and electron shower simulations for neutrino energies in the range of 0.5-5 GeV. Comparing prediction with and without angular-dependence, we observe an average energy bias between -0.9\% at 0.5 GeV and -0.6\% at 5 GeV. While small, these values are close to the typical requirement of 2\% for the energy scale uncertainty of future experiments, and indicate the need to obtain actual experimental constraints at low $dE/dx$ and take the effect into account in order to achieve the best precision in future LAr TPC electron neutrino calorimetry.

2025-06-12, **Two coincidences are a clue: Probing a GeV-scale dark QCD sector**, Yi Chung et.al., [2506.10928v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10928v1)

 The similarity between dark matter and baryon energy densities suggests the existence of a dark sector analogous to the visible QCD sector. In addition, small-scale structure issues can be addressed by dark matter self-interactions with a cross section comparable to that of QCD. Both observations point to a GeV-scale dark QCD sector. In this letter, guided by these two coincidences, we investigate how a chiral dark QCD model with a MeV-scale dark photon can resolve the core-cusp problem. A potential third coincidence, associated with the latest measurement of $N\_{\rm eff}$ being lower than the Standard Model prediction, is also discussed. Current constraints leave a finite window in the parameter space, which can be tested by future experiments such as Gamma Factory.

2025-06-12, **Search for Primordial Black Holes from the International Space Station with the SQM-ISS detector**, Francesca Liberatori et.al., [2506.10246v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10246v1)

 In this paper we discuss the observational capabilities and sensitivity of the SQM-ISS detector to primordial black holes. The SQM-ISS experiment aims to detect slow, non relativistic massive particles within cosmic rays, using a detector on board the International Space Station. The device is designed to recognize the passage of highly penetrating and dense particles in a wide range of mass and charge states such as Strange Quark Matter (SQM). These particles, traveling at speeds typical of gravitationally bound objects in the galaxy - around 250 km/s - are also possible candidates of dark matter. The ability of SQM-ISS to identify penetrating, massive and slow-moving objects allows it also to be sensitive to the detection of primordial black holes. We discuss how black holes, traveling through the detector at velocities compatible with galactic orbital speeds, can be identified based on their interaction signatures.

2025-06-12, **SN 2023xgo: Helium rich Type Icn or Carbon-Flash Type Ibn supernova?**, Anjasha Gangopadhyay et.al., [2506.10700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10700v1)

 We present observations of SN 2023xgo, a transitional Type Ibn/Icn SN, from $-5.6$ to 63 days relative to $r$-band peak. Early spectra show CIII $\lambda$5696 emission like Type Icn SNe, shifting to Type Ibn features. The He I velocities (1800-10000 km s$^{-1}$) and pseudo-equivalent widths are among the highest in the Ibn/Icn class. The light curve declines at 0.14 mag d$^{-1}$ until 30 days, matching SNe Ibn/Icn but slower than fast transients. SN 2023xgo is the faintest in our SN Ibn sample (M$\_{r}$ = -17.65 $\pm$ 0.04) but shows typical colour and host properties. Semi-analytical modelling of the light curve suggests a compact CSM shell (10$^{12}$-10$^{13}$ cm), mass-loss rate between 10$^{-4}$-10$^{-3}$ M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ with CSM and ejecta masses of $\sim$0.22 and 0.12 M$\_{\odot}$, respectively. Post-maximum light-curve, spectral modelling favours a $\sim$3 M$\_{\odot}$ helium star progenitor with extended ($\sim$10$^{15}$ cm), stratified CSM (density exponent of 2.9) and mass-loss rate of 0.1-2.7 M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. These two mass-loss regimes imply a radially varying CSM, shaped by asymmetry or changes in the progenitors mass loss over time. This mass-loss behavior fits both binary and single-star evolution. Early Icn-like features stem from hot carbon ionization, fading to Ibn-like with cooling. SN 2023xgo thus offers rare insight into the connection between SNe Icn, Ibn, and SNe Ibn with ejecta signatures.
