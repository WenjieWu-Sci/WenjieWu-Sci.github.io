2023-11-08, **The High Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P): Sensitive broadband X-ray observations of transient phenomena in the 2030s**, Murray Brightman et.al., [2311.04856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04856v1)

 HEX-P will launch at a time when the sky is being routinely scanned for transient gravitational wave, electromagnetic and neutrino phenomena that will require the capabilities of a sensitive, broadband X-ray telescope for follow up studies. These include the merger of compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes, stellar explosions, and the birth of new compact objects. \hexp\ will probe the accretion and ejecta from these transient phenomena through the study of relativistic outflows and reprocessed emission, provide unique capabilities for understanding jet physics, and potentially revealing the nature of the central engine.

2023-11-08, **The High Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P): resolving the nature of Sgr A* flares, compact object binaries and diffuse X-ray emission in the Galactic Center and beyond**, Kaya Mori et.al., [2311.04854v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04854v1)

 HEX-P is a probe-class mission concept that will combine high spatial resolution X-ray imaging ($<10"$ FWHM) and broad spectral coverage (0.2-80 keV) with an effective area far superior to current facilities' (including XMM-Newton and NuSTAR). These capabilities will enable revolutionary new insights into a variety of important astrophysical problems. We present scientific objectives and simulations of HEX-P observations of the Galactic Center (GC) and Bulge. We demonstrate the unique and powerful capabilities of the HEX-P observatory for studying both X-ray point sources and diffuse X-ray emission. HEX-P will be uniquely equipped to explore a variety of major topics in Galactic astrophysics, allowing us to (1) investigate broad-band properties of X-ray flares emitted from the supermassive black hole (BH) at Sgr A* and probe the associated particle acceleration and emission mechanisms; (2) identify hard X-ray sources detected by NuSTAR and determine X-ray point source populations in different regions and luminosity ranges; (3) determine the distribution of compact object binaries in the nuclear star cluster and the composition of the Galactic Ridge X-ray emission; (4) identify X-ray transients and measure fundamental parameters such as BH spin; (5) find hidden pulsars in the GC; (6) search for BH-OB binaries and hard X-ray flares from young stellar objects in young massive clusters; (7) measure white dwarf (WD) masses of magnetic CVs to deepen our understanding of CV evolution and the origin of WD magnetic fields; (8) explore primary particle accelerators in the GC in synergy with future TeV and neutrino observatories; (9) map out cosmic-ray distributions by observing non-thermal X-ray filaments; (10) explore past X-ray outbursts from Sgr A* through X-ray reflection components from giant molecular clouds.

2023-11-08, **The High Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P): Galactic PeVatrons, star clusters, superbubbles, microquasar jets, and gamma-ray binaries**, Kaya Mori et.al., [2311.04851v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04851v1)

 HEX-P is a probe-class mission concept that will combine high spatial resolution X-ray imaging (<10" FWHM) and broad spectral coverage (0.2-80 keV) with an effective area far superior to current facilities (including XMM-Newton and NuSTAR) to enable revolutionary new insights into a variety of important astrophysical problems. With the recent discoveries of over 40 ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources (detected above 100 TeV) and neutrino emission in the Galactic Plane, we have entered a new era of multi-messenger astrophysics facing the exciting reality of Galactic PeVatrons. In the next decade, as more Galactic PeVatrons and TeV gamma-ray sources are expected to be discovered, the identification of their acceleration and emission mechanisms will be the most pressing issue in both particle and high-energy astrophysics. In this paper, along with its companion papers (Reynolds et al. 2023, Mori et al. 2023), we will present that HEX-P is uniquely suited to address important problems in various cosmic-ray accelerators, including Galactic PeVatrons, through investigating synchrotron X-ray emission of TeV-PeV electrons produced by both leptonic and hadronic processes.

2023-11-08, **The High Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P): the most powerful jets through the lens of a superb X-ray eye**, Lea Marcotulli et.al., [2311.04801v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04801v1)

 A fraction of the active supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies in our Universe are capable of launching extreme kiloparsec-long relativistic jets. These jets are known multiband (radio to $\gamma$-ray) and multimessenger (neutrino) emitters, and some of them have been monitored over several decades at all accessible wavelengths. However, many open questions remain unanswered about the processes powering these highly energetic phenomena. These jets intrinsically produce soft-to-hard X-ray emission that extends from $E\sim0.1\,\rm keV$ up to $E>100\,\rm keV$. Simultaneous broadband X-ray coverage, combined with excellent timing and imaging capabilities, is required to uncover the physics of jets. Indeed, truly simultaneous soft-to-hard X-ray coverage, in synergy with current and upcoming high-energy facilities (such as IXPE, COSI, CTAO, etc.) and neutrino detectors (e.g., IceCube), would enable us to disentangle the particle population responsible for the high-energy radiation from these jets. A sensitive hard X-ray survey ($F\_{8-24\,\rm keV}<10^{-15}\,\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$) could unveil the bulk of their population in the early Universe. Acceleration and radiative processes responsible for the majority of their X-ray emission would be pinned down by microsecond timing capabilities at both soft and hard X-rays. Furthermore, imaging jet structures for the first time in the hard X-ray regime could unravel the origin of their high-energy emission. The proposed Probe-class mission concept High Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P) combines all these required capabilities, making it the crucial next-generation X-ray telescope in the multi-messenger, time-domain era. HEX-P will be the ideal mission to unravel the science behind the most powerful accelerators in the universe.

2023-11-08, **Dark Energy Constraints from Pantheon+ Ia Supernovae Data**, Sergio Torres-Arzayus et.al., [2311.04759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04759v1)

 Measurements of the current expansion rate of the Universe, $H\_0$, using standard candles, disagree with those derived from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This discrepancy, known as the \emph{Hubble tension}, is substantial and suggests the possibility of revisions to the standard cosmological model (Cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and cold dark matter - LCDM). Dynamic dark energy (DE) models that introduce deviations in the expansion history relative to LCDM could potentially explain this tension. We used Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data to test a dynamic DE model consisting of an equation of state that varies linearly with the cosmological scale factor $a$. To evaluate this model, we developed a new statistic (the \ta\ statistic) used in conjunction with an optimization code that minimizes its value to obtain model parameters. The \ta\ statistic reduces bias errors (in comparison to the $\chi^2$ statistic) because it retains the sign of the residuals, which is meaningful in testing the dynamic DE model as the deviations in the expansion history introduced by this model act asymmetrically in redshift space. The DE model fits the SNe data reasonably well, but the available SNe data lacks the statistical power to discriminate between LCDM and alternative models. To further assess the model using CMB data, we computed the distance to the last scattering surface and compared the results with that derived from the \emph{Planck} observations. Although the simple dynamic DE model tested does not completely resolve the tension, it is not ruled out by the data and could still play a role alongside other physical effects.

2023-11-08, **Test the weak cosmic censorship conjecture via cold dark matter-black hole and ultralight dark matter-black hole**, Meirong Tang et.al., [2311.04415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04415v1)

 The weak cosmic censorship conjecture states that the black hole singularity is hidden inside the event horizon of the black hole, making it impossible for an external observer to measure. In this study, we investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture test of dark matter halo-black hole systems in both the cold dark matter model and ultralight dark matter model scenarios, with the aim of gaining insights into the influence of dark matter particles on the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. By examining the particle incident on an extremely or nearly extremal dark matter- black hole, as well as the scattering of a scalar field by an extreme or near-extreme dark matter- black hole. We find that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture does not violate the extreme and near-extreme dark matter-black hole systems for incident particles. When a scalar field is incident on an extreme dark matter-black hole system, the weak cosmic censorship conjecture can be violated by a scalar field pattern that satisfies $\dfrac{1}{2M\omega\_{0}}<\dfrac{\omega}{m}<\dfrac{M\omega\_{0}}{2M^{2}\omega\_{0}^{2}+k\_{i}}$ ($k\_{i}<0$; where $k\_{1}$ corresponds to the cold dark matter model and $k\_{2}$ corresponds to the ultralight dark matter model). The weak cosmic censorship conjecture remains unviolated in the presence of a scalar field incident upon a nearly extreme dark matter-black hole system. This research will contribute to furthering our comprehension of the intricate interplay between dark matter and black holes.

2023-11-08, **Photometric prioritization of neutron star merger candidates**, E. O. Ofek et.al., [2311.04863v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04863v1)

 Rapid identification of the optical counterparts of Neutron Star (NS) merger events discovered by gravitational wave detectors may require observing a large error region and sifting through a large number of transients to identify the object of interest. Given the expense of spectroscopic observations, a question arises: How can we utilize photometric observations for candidate prioritization, and what kinds of photometric observations are needed to achieve this goal? NS merger kilonova exhibits low ejecta mass (~5x10^-2 solar mass) and a rapidly evolving photospheric radius (with a velocity ~0.2c). As a consequence, these sources display rapid optical-flux evolution. Indeed, selection based on fast flux variations is commonly used for young supernovae and NS mergers. In this study, we leverage the best currently available flux-limited transient survey - the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey - to extend and quantify this approach. We focus on selecting transients detected in a 3-day cadence survey and observed at a one-day cadence. We explore their distribution in the phase space defined by g-r, g-dot, and r-dot. Our analysis demonstrates that for a significant portion of the time during the first week, the kilonova AT 2017gfo stands out in this phase space. It is important to note that this investigation is subject to various biases and challenges; nevertheless, it suggests that certain photometric observations can be leveraged to identify transients with the highest probability of being fast-evolving events. We also find that a large fraction (~0.75) of the transient candidates with \|g-dot\|>0.7 mag/day, are cataclysmic variables or active galactic nuclei with radio counterparts.

2023-11-08, **Detection and Identification of Asteroids with the 4-m ILMT**, Anna Pospieszalska-Surdej et.al., [2311.04718v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04718v1)

 A very unique strength of the Devasthal Observatory is its capability of detecting optical transients with the 4-m International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) and to rapidly follow them up using the 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) and/or the 3.6-m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT), installed right next to it. In this context, we have inspected 20 fields observed during 9 consecutive nights in October-November 2022 during the first commissioning phase of the ILMT. Each of these fields has an angular extent of $22^\prime$ in declination by $9 \times 22^\prime$ in right ascension. Combining both a visual search for optical transients and an automatic search for these using an image subtraction technique (see the ILMT poster paper by Pranshu et al.), we report a total of 232 significant transient candidates. After consulting the Minor Planet Center database of asteroids, we could identify among these 219 positions of known asteroids brighter than $V=22$. These correspond to the confirmed positions of 78 distinct known asteroids. Analysis of the remaining CCD frames covering 19 more fields (out of 20) should lead to an impressive number of asteroids observed in only 9 nights. The conclusion is that in order to detect and characterize new supernovae, micro-lensing events, highly variable stars, multiply imaged quasars, etc. among the ILMT optical transients, we shall first have to identify all known and new asteroids. Thanks to its large diameter and short focal length (f/D $\sim$ 2.4), the ILMT turns out to be an excellent asteroid hunter.

2023-11-08, **An automated photometric pipeline for the ILMT data**, Bhavya Ailawadhi et.al., [2311.04713v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04713v1)

 The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) is a 4-meter survey telescope continuously observing towards the zenith in the SDSS g', r', and i' bands. This survey telescope is designed to detect various astrophysical transients (for example, supernovae) and very faint objects like multiply-imaged quasars and low surface brightness galaxies. A single scan of a 22$'$ strip of sky contains a large amount of photometric information. To process this type of data, it becomes critical to have tools or pipelines that can handle it efficiently and accurately with minimal human biases. We offer a fully automated pipeline generated in Python to perform aperture photometry over the ILMT data acquired with the CCD in Time Delayed Integration (TDI) mode. The instrumental magnitudes are calibrated with respect to the Pan-STARRS-1 catalogue. The light curves generated from the calibrated magnitudes will allows us to characterize the objects as variable stars or rapidly decaying transients.
