2023-06-28, **Setting an upper limit for the total TeV neutrino flux from the disk of our Galaxy**, Vittoria Vecchiotti et.al., [2306.16305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16305v1)

 We set an upper limit for the total TeV neutrino flux expected from the disk of our Galaxy in the region $\|l\|<30^{\circ}$ and $\|b\|<2^{\circ}$ probed by the ANTARES experiment. We include both the diffuse emission, due to the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, and the possible contribution produced by gamma-ray Galactic sources. The neutrino diffuse emission is calculated under different assumptions for the cosmic ray spatial and energy distribution in our Galaxy. In particular, we assume that the total gamma-ray flux produced by all the sources, resolved and unresolved by H.E.S.S., is produced via hadronic interaction and, hence, is coupled with neutrino emission. We compare our total neutrino flux with the recent ANTARES measurement of the neutrino from the Galactic Ridge. We show that the ANTARES best-fit flux requires the existence of a large source component, close to or even larger than the most optimistic predictions obtained with our approach.

2023-06-28, **A Pythagoras-like theorem for CP violation in neutrino oscillations**, Shu Luo et.al., [2306.16231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16231v1)

 It is well known that the golden appearance channels of neutrino oscillations are $\nu^{}\_{\mu} \to \nu^{}\_{e}$ and $\overline{\nu}^{}\_{\mu} \to \overline{\nu}^{}\_{e}$, and their probabilities in vacuum are determined by three CP-conserving flavor mixing factors ${\cal R}^{}\_{ij} \equiv {\rm Re} (U^{}\_{\mu i} U^{}\_{e j} U^{*}\_{\mu j} U^{*}\_{e i})$ and the universal Jarlskog invariant of CP violation ${\cal J}^{}\_{\nu} \equiv (-1)^{i+j} {\rm Im} (U^{}\_{\mu i} U^{}\_{e j} U^{*}\_{\mu j} U^{*}\_{e i})$ (for $i, j = 1, 2, 3$ and $i < j$) with $U$ being the $3 \times 3$ Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix. We show that the magnitude of ${\cal J}^{}\_{\nu}$ can be calculated from ${\cal J}^{2}\_{\nu} = {\cal R}^{}\_{12} {\cal R}^{}\_{13} + {\cal R}^{}\_{12} {\cal R}^{}\_{23} + {\cal R}^{}\_{13} {\cal R}^{}\_{23}$ which holds as a natural consequence of the unitarity of $U$, and this Pythagoras-like relation provides a novel cross-check of the result of ${\cal J}^{}\_{\nu}$ that will be directly measured in the next-generation $\nu^{}\_{\mu} \to \nu^{}\_{e}$ and $\overline{\nu}^{}\_{\mu} \to \overline{\nu}^{}\_{e}$ oscillation experiments. Terrestrial matter effects on ${\cal J}^{}\_{\nu}$ and ${\cal R}^{}\_{ij}$ are also discussed.

2023-06-28, **Diffuse neutrino background from past core-collapse supernovae**, Shin'ichiro Ando et.al., [2306.16076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16076v1)

 Core-collapse supernovae are among the most powerful explosions in the universe, emitting thermal neutrinos that carry away the majority of the gravitational binding energy released. These neutrinos create a diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), one of the largest energy budgets among all radiation backgrounds. Detecting the DSNB is a crucial goal of modern high-energy astrophysics and particle physics, providing valuable insights in both core-collapse modeling, neutrino physics, and cosmic supernova rate history. In this review, we discuss the key ingredients of DSNB calculation and what we can learn from future detections, including black-hole formation and non-standard neutrino interactions. Additionally, we provide an overview of the latest updates in neutrino experiments, which could lead to the detection of the DSNB in the next decade. With the promise of this breakthrough discovery on the horizon, the study of DSNB holds enormous potential for advancing our understanding of the Universe.

2023-06-28, **Neutrino spectrum and energy loss rates due to weak processes on hot $^{56}$Fe in pre-supernova environment**, Alan A. Dzhioev et.al., [2306.16055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16055v1)

 Applying TQRPA calculations of Gamow--Teller strength functions in hot nuclei, we compute the (anti)neutrino spectra and energy loss rates arising from weak processes on hot $^{56}$Fe under pre-supernova conditions. We use a realistic pre-supernova model calculated by the stellar evolution code MESA. Taking into account both charged and neutral current processes, we demonstrate that weak reactions with hot nuclei can produce high-energy (anti)neutrinos. We also show that, for hot nuclei, the energy loss via (anti)neutrino emission is significantly larger than that for nuclei in their ground state. It is found that the neutral current de-excitation via the $\nu\bar\nu$-pair emission is presumably a dominant source of antineutrinos. In accordance with other studies, we confirm that the so-called single-state approximation for neutrino spectra might fail under certain pre-supernova conditions. }

2023-06-28, **Anomaly induced cooling of Neutron Stars: A Standard Model contribution**, Sabyasachi Chakraborty et.al., [2306.15872v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15872v1)

 Young neutron stars cool via the emission of neutrinos from their core. A precise understanding of all the different processes producing neutrinos in the hot and degenerate matter is essential for assessing the cooling rate of such stars. The main Standard Model processes contributing to this effect are $\nu$ bremsstrahlung, mURCA among others. In this paper, we investigate another Standard Model process initiated by the Wess-Zumino-Witten term, leading to the emission of neutrino pairs via $N\gamma\to N\nu\bar\nu$. We find that such processes, with degenerate neutrons, can be comparable and even dominate over the prototypical and well-known cooling mechanisms.

2023-06-28, **Evaluating Portable Parallelization Strategies for Heterogeneous Architectures in High Energy Physics**, Mohammad Atif et.al., [2306.15869v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15869v1)

 High-energy physics (HEP) experiments have developed millions of lines of code over decades that are optimized to run on traditional x86 CPU systems. However, we are seeing a rapidly increasing fraction of floating point computing power in leadership-class computing facilities and traditional data centers coming from new accelerator architectures, such as GPUs. HEP experiments are now faced with the untenable prospect of rewriting millions of lines of x86 CPU code, for the increasingly dominant architectures found in these computational accelerators. This task is made more challenging by the architecture-specific languages and APIs promoted by manufacturers such as NVIDIA, Intel and AMD. Producing multiple, architecture-specific implementations is not a viable scenario, given the available person power and code maintenance issues.   The Portable Parallelization Strategies team of the HEP Center for Computational Excellence is investigating the use of Kokkos, SYCL, OpenMP, std::execution::parallel and alpaka as potential portability solutions that promise to execute on multiple architectures from the same source code, using representative use cases from major HEP experiments, including the DUNE experiment of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility, and the ATLAS and CMS experiments of the Large Hadron Collider. This cross-cutting evaluation of portability solutions using real applications will help inform and guide the HEP community when choosing their software and hardware suites for the next generation of experimental frameworks. We present the outcomes of our studies, including performance metrics, porting challenges, API evaluations, and build system integration.

2023-06-27, **A large-scale magnetic field via $αΩ$ dynamo in binary neutron star mergers**, Kenta Kiuchi et.al., [2306.15721v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15721v1)

 The merger of neutron stars drives a relativistic jet which can be observed as a short gamma-ray burst. A strong large-scale magnetic field is necessary to launch the relativistic jet. However, the magnetohydrodynamical mechanism to build up this magnetic field remains uncertain. Here we show that the $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo mechanism driven by the magnetorotational instability builds up the large-scale magnetic field inside the long-lived binary neutron star merger remnant by performing an {\it ab initio} super-high resolution neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamics merger simulation in full general relativity. As a result, the magnetic field induces the Poynting-flux dominated relativistic outflow with the luminosity $\sim 10^{51}$\,erg/s and magnetically-driven post-merger mass ejection with the mass $\sim 0.1M\_\odot$. Therefore, the magnetar scenario in binary neutron star mergers is possible. These can be the engines of short-hard gamma-ray bursts and very bright kilonovae. Therefore, this scenario is testable in future observation.

2023-06-27, **Refractive neutrino masses, ultralight dark matter and cosmology**, Manibrata Sen et.al., [2306.15718v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15718v1)

 We consider in detail a possibility that the observed neutrino oscillations are due to refraction on ultralight scalar boson dark matter. We introduce the refractive mass squared, $\widetilde{m}^2$, and study its properties: dependence on neutrino energy, state of the background, etc. If the background is in a state of cold gas of particles, $\widetilde{m}^2$ shows a resonance dependence on energy. Above the resonance ($E \gg E\_R $), we find that $\widetilde{m}^2$ has the same properties as the usual vacuum mass. Below the resonance, $\widetilde{m}^2$ decreases with energy, which allows to avoid the cosmological bound on the sum of neutrino masses. We consider the validity of the results: effects of multiple interactions with scalars, and modification of the dispersion relation. We show that for values of parameters of the system required to reproduce the observed neutrino masses, perturbativity is broken at low energies, which border above the resonance. If the background is in the state of coherent classical field, the refractive mass does not depend on energy but may show time dependence. It coincides with the refractive mass in a cold gas at high energies. Refractive nature of neutrino mass can be tested by searches of its dependence on energy.

2023-06-27, **Unveiling Neutrino Halos with CMB Lensing**, Selim C. Hotinli et.al., [2306.15715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15715v1)

 The existence of a cosmic neutrino background has been inferred indirectly from cosmological surveys through its effect on the linear-theory evolution of primordial density perturbations, as well as from measurements of the primordial abundances of light elements. Constraints on the masses of the three neutrino species imply that at least two of them move non-relativistically today. As a consequence, non-linear evolution of density perturbations results in the formation of neutrino halos around dark-matter halos. We study whether these neutrino halos can be detected in the foreseeable future through measurements of weak gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background, thus providing, possibly, the first beyond-linear-theory signature of cosmic neutrinos.

2023-06-27, **Electromagnetic Cascade Emission from Neutrino-Coincident Tidal Disruption Events**, Chengchao Yuan et.al., [2306.15659v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15659v1)

 The potential association between Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and high-energy astrophysical neutrinos implies the acceleration of cosmic rays. These accelerated particles will initiate electromagnetic (EM) cascades spanning from keV to GeV energies by the processes related to neutrino production. We model the EM cascade and neutrino emissions by numerically solving the time-dependent transport equations and discuss the implications for AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr in the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands. We show that the $\gamma$-ray constraints from \emph{Fermi} can constrain the size of the radiation zone and the maximum energy of injected protons, and that the corresponding expected neutrino event numbers in follow-up searches are limited to be less than about 0.1. Depending on the efficiency of $p\gamma$ interactions, the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray signals can be expected closer to the peak of the optical-ultraviolet (OUV) luminosity, or to the time of the neutrino production.

2023-06-27, **Exploring mixed lepton-quark interactions in non-resonant leptoquark production at the LHC**, João Gonçalves et.al., [2306.15460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15460v1)

 Searches for new physics (NP) at particle colliders typically involve multivariate analysis of kinematic distributions of final state particles produced in a decay of a hypothetical NP resonance. Since the pair-production cross-sections mediated by such resonances are strongly suppressed by the NP scale, this analysis becomes less relevant for NP searches for masses of the BSM resonance above 1 TeV. On the other hand, $t$-channel processes are less sensitive to the mass of the virtual mediator and therefore larger phase-space can be potentially probed as well as the couplings between the NP particles and the Standard Model fields. The fact that transitions between different generations of quarks and leptons may exist, the potential of the search presented in this article can be used, as a reference guide, to enlarge significantly the scope of searches performed at the LHC to flavour off-diagonal channels, in a theoretically consistent approach. In this work, we study non-resonant production of scalar leptoquarks which have been proposed in the literature to provide a potential avenue for radiative generation of neutrino masses, accommodating as well the existing flavour physics data. Final states involving just two muons at the LHC ($\mu^+, \mu^-$), are used as a well-motivated case study.

2023-06-27, **Prediction of non-SUSY AdS conjecture on the lightest neutrino mass revisited**, Cao H. Nam et.al., [2306.15383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15383v1)

 We study the constraint of the non-SUSY AdS conjecture on the three-dimensional vacua obtained from the compactification of the Standard Model coupled to Einstein gravity on a circle where the three-dimensional components of the four-dimensional metric are general functions of both non-compact and compact coordinates. We find from studying the wavefunction profile of the three-dimensional metric in the compactified dimension that the radius of the compactified dimension must be quantized. Consequently, the three-dimensional vacua are constrained by not only the non-SUSY AdS conjecture but also the quantization rule of the circle radius, leading to both upper and lower bounds for the mass of the lightest neutrino as $\sqrt{2}\leq m\_\nu/\sqrt{\Lambda\_4}<\sqrt{3}$ where $\Lambda\_4\simeq5.06\times10^{-84}$ GeV$^2$ is the observed cosmological constant. This means that the lightest neutrino should have a mass around $10^{-32}$ eV or it would be well-approximately massless. With this prediction, we reconstruct the light neutrino mass matrix that is fixed by the neutrino oscillation data and in terms of three new mixing angles and six new phases for both the normal ordering and inverted ordering. In the situation that the light neutrino mass matrix is Hermitian, we calculate its numerical value in the $3\sigma$ range.

2023-06-27, **Radiative neutrino masses and the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound**, Patrick Adolf et.al., [2306.15313v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15313v1)

 Recently, an increasing interest in UV/IR mixing phenomena has drawn attention to the range of validity of standard quantum field theory. Here we explore the consequences of such a limited range of validity in the context of radiative models for neutrino mass generation. We adopt an argument first published by Cohen, Kaplan and Nelson that gravity implies both UV and IR cutoffs, apply it to the loop integrals describing radiative corrections, and demonstrate that this effect has significant consequences for the parameter space of radiative neutrino mass models.

2023-06-27, **Atmospheric Lepton Fluxes via Two-Dimensional Matrix Cascade Equations**, Tetiana Kozynets et.al., [2306.15263v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15263v1)

 The atmospheric lepton fluxes play a crucial role in many particle and astroparticle physics experiments, e.g. in establishing the neutrino signal and the muon background for neutrino oscillation measurements, or the atmospheric background for astrophysical neutrino searches. The Matrix Cascade Equations (MCEq) code is a numerical tool used to model the atmospheric lepton fluxes by solving a system of coupled differential equations for particle production, interaction, and decay at extremely low computational costs. Previously, the MCEq framework only accommodated longitudinal development of air showers, an approximation that works well for neutrino and muon fluxes at high energies (O(10 GeV) and above). However, for accurate calculations of atmospheric lepton angular distributions at lower energies, the lateral component of hadronic cascades becomes significant, necessitating three-dimensional calculation schemes. We introduce "2D MCEq", an efficient numerical approach for combined longitudinal and angular evolution of air showers that retains the low computational complexity. The accuracy of the "2D MCEq" is affirmed by its benchmark comparison with the standard Monte Carlo code CORSIKA. This study paves the way for efficient three-dimensional calculations of atmospheric neutrino fluxes.

2023-06-27, **Baryogenesis via flavoured leptogenesis in a minimal type-II seesaw model**, Sreerupa Chongdar et.al., [2306.15229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15229v1)

 We study baryogenesis via leptogenesis in an extension of the Standard Model by adding one right-handed neutrino and one triplet scalar. These heavy particles contribute to the generation of tiny neutrino mass through seesaw mechanism. The contribution of the heavy particles to the neutrino masses is inversely proportional to their corresponding masses. Considering leptogenesis is achieved by the decay of the right-handed neutrino, the new source of CP asymmetry comes solely from the decay of the right-handed neutrino with one-loop vertex diagram involving the triplet scalar. The predictiveness of the model is enhanced by introducing Fritzsch-type textures for the neutrino mass matrix and charged lepton mass matrix. We execute the parameter space study following the latest neutrino oscillation data. We study baryogenesis via leptogenesis in the two-flavoured regime, using the zero textures, and show that there is an enhancement in baryon asymmetry as compared to the unflavoured regime. For two-flavour leptogenesis we consider the suitable temperature regime $T\subset\left[10^{10},10^{11}\right]$ GeV. We also study the common correlation of CP violation between low and high-energy regimes using the geometrical description of CP violation in terms of unitarity triangle.

 Xenon dual-phase time projections chambers (TPCs) have proven to be a successful technology in studying physical phenomena that require low-background conditions. With 40t of liquid xenon (LXe) in the TPC baseline design, DARWIN will have a high sensitivity for the detection of particle dark matter, neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$), and axion-like particles (ALPs). Although cosmic muons are a source of background that cannot be entirely eliminated, they may be greatly diminished by placing the detector deep underground. In this study, we used Monte Carlo simulations to model the cosmogenic background expected for the DARWIN observatory at four underground laboratories: Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS), Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM) and SNOLAB. We determine the production rates of unstable xenon isotopes and tritium due to muon-included neutron fluxes and muon-induced spallation. These are expected to represent the dominant contributions to cosmogenic backgrounds and thus the most relevant for site selection.

2023-06-28, **Probing the mass relation between supermassive black holes and dark matter halos at high redshifts by gravitational wave experiments**, Kazuya Furusawa et.al., [2306.16281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16281v1)

 Numerous observations have shown that almost all galaxies in our Universe host supermassive black holes (SMBHs), but there is still much debate about their formation and evolutionary processes. Recently, gravitational waves (GWs) have been expected to be a new and important informative observation, in particular, in the low-frequency region by making use of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). As an evolutionary process of the SMBHs, we revisit a dark matter (DM) halo-SMBH coevolution model based on the halo merger tree employing an ansatz for the mass relation between the DM halos and the SMBHs at $z=6$. In this model, the mass of SMBHs grows through their mergers associated with the halo mergers, and hence the evolutionary information must be stored in the GWs emitted at the mergers. We investigate the stochastic gravitational background from the coalescing SMBH binaries, which the PTAs can detect, and also the GW bursts emitted at the mergers, which can be detected by the mHz band observations such as LISA. We also discuss the possibility of probing the mass relation between the DM halos and the SMBHs at high redshift by future GW observations.

2023-06-28, **The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array: VI. Challenging the ultralight dark matter paradigm**, Clemente Smarra et.al., [2306.16228v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16228v1)

 Pulsar Timing Array experiments probe the presence of possible scalar/pseudoscalar ultralight dark matter particles through decade-long timing of an ensemble of galactic millisecond radio pulsars. With the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array, we focus on the most robust scenario, in which dark matter interacts only gravitationally with ordinary baryonic matter. Our results show that ultralight particles with masses $10^{-24.0}~\text{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-23.2}~\text{eV}$ cannot constitute $100\%$ of the measured local dark matter density, but can have at most local density $\rho\lesssim 0.15$ GeV/cm$^3$.

2023-06-28, **The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array: V. Implications for massive black holes, dark matter and the early Universe**, J. Antoniadis et.al., [2306.16227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16227v1)

 The European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) and Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) collaborations have measured a low-frequency common signal in the combination of their second and first data releases respectively, with the correlation properties of a gravitational wave background (GWB). Such signal may have its origin in a number of physical processes including a cosmic population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs); inflation, phase transitions, cosmic strings and tensor mode generation by non-linear evolution of scalar perturbations in the early Universe; oscillations of the Galactic potential in the presence of ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). At the current stage of emerging evidence, it is impossible to discriminate among the different origins. Therefore, in this paper, we consider each process separately, and investigate the implications of the signal under the hypothesis that it is generated by that specific process. We find that the signal is consistent with a cosmic population of inspiralling SMBHBs, and its relatively high amplitude can be used to place constraints on binary merger timescales and the SMBH-host galaxy scaling relations. If this origin is confirmed, this is the first direct evidence that SMBHBs merge in nature, adding an important observational piece to the puzzle of structure formation and galaxy evolution. As for early Universe processes, the measurement would place tight constraints on the cosmic string tension and on the level of turbulence developed by first-order phase transitions. Other processes would require non-standard scenarios, such as a blue-tilted inflationary spectrum or an excess in the primordial spectrum of scalar perturbations at large wavenumbers. Finally, a ULDM origin of the detected signal is disfavoured, which leads to direct constraints on the abundance of ULDM in our Galaxy.

2023-06-28, **The NANOGrav 15-year Data Set: Search for Signals from New Physics**, Adeela Afzal et.al., [2306.16219v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16219v1)

 The 15-year pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) shows positive evidence for the presence of a low-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) background. In this paper, we investigate potential cosmological interpretations of this signal, specifically cosmic inflation, scalar-induced GWs, first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, and domain walls. We find that, with the exception of stable cosmic strings of field theory origin, all these models can reproduce the observed signal. When compared to the standard interpretation in terms of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many cosmological models seem to provide a better fit resulting in Bayes factors in the range from 10 to 100. However, these results strongly depend on modeling assumptions about the cosmic SMBHB population and, at this stage, should not be regarded as evidence for new physics. Furthermore, we identify excluded parameter regions where the predicted GW signal from cosmological sources significantly exceeds the NANOGrav signal. These parameter constraints are independent of the origin of the NANOGrav signal and illustrate how pulsar timing data provide a new way to constrain the parameter space of these models. Finally, we search for deterministic signals produced by models of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and dark matter substructures in the Milky Way. We find no evidence for either of these signals and thus report updated constraints on these models. In the case of ULDM, these constraints outperform torsion balance and atomic clock constraints for ULDM coupled to electrons, muons, or gluons.

2023-06-28, **Phase diagram determination at fivefold nuclear compression**, Gao-Chan Yong et.al., [2306.16005v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16005v1)

 In the standard model of particle physics, the strong force is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamic (QCD). Based on QCD properties, it is commonly believed that at sufficiently high temperatures or densities, the hadrons are melted into their constituent quarks, i.e., undergo a deconfinement transition to a new phase of quarks and gluons. Such phase is frequently called quark matter or quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Although QGP has been observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, it is currently an open question about the onset of deconfinement. By comparing simulations from a reliable hadron and quark relativistic transport model and recent STAR experimental data, we infer that the onset of hadron-quark phase transition occurs at about fivefold nuclear compression corresponding temperature $T\sim$ 112 MeV and baryon chemical potential $\mu\_{B}\sim$ 586 MeV in nuclear matter phase diagram. This finding has important implications for the studies of early and present universe, such as relevant to the fraction of dark matter formed in early universe and structure of neutron stars as well as the dynamics of neutron star mergers.

2023-06-28, **Inside MOND: Testing Gravity with Stellar Accelerations**, Maxwell Finan-Jenkin et.al., [2306.15939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15939v1)

 We quantify the differences between stellar accelerations in disk galaxies formed in a MONDian universe relative to galaxies with the identical baryonic matter distributions and a fitted cold dark matter halo. In a Milky Way-like galaxy the maximal transverse acceleration is ${\cal {O}}(10^{-9})$ arcseconds per year per decade, well beyond even the most optimistic extrapolations of current capabilities. Conversely, the maximum difference in the line-of-sight acceleration is ${\cal {O}}(1)$ centimetre per second per decade at solar distances from the galactic centre. This level of precision is within reach of plausible future instruments.

2023-06-27, **Tunable Wire Metamaterials for an Axion Haloscope**, Nolan Kowitt et.al., [2306.15734v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15734v1)

 Metamaterials based on regular two-dimensional arrays of thin wires have attracted renewed attention in light of a recently proposed strategy to search for dark matter axions. When placed in the external magnetic field, such metamaterials facilitate resonant conversion of axions into plasmons near their plasma frequency. Since the axion mass is not known a priori, a practical way to tune the plasma frequency of metamaterial is required. In this work, we have studied a system of two interpenetrating rectangular wire lattices where their relative position is varied. The plasma frequency as a function of their relative position in two dimensions has been mapped out experimentally, and compared with both a semi-analytic theory of wire-array metamaterials and numerical simulations. Theory and simulation yield essentially identical results, which in turn are in excellent agreement with experimental data. Over the range of translations studied, the plasma frequency can be tuned over a range of 16%.

2023-06-27, **Bubbletrons**, Iason Baldes et.al., [2306.15555v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15555v1)

 In cosmological first-order phase transitions (PT) with relativistic bubble walls, high-energy shells of particles generically form on the inner and outer sides of the walls. Shells from different bubbles can then collide with energies much larger than the PT or inflation scales, and with sizeable rates, realising a `bubbletron'. As an application, we calculate the maximal dark matter mass $M\_{DM}$ that can be produced from shell collisions in a U(1) gauge PT, for scales of the PT $v\_\varphi$ from MeV to $10^{16}$ GeV. We find for example $M\_{DM} \sim 10^6/10^{11}/10^{15}$ GeV for $v\_\varphi \sim 10^{-2}/10^3/10^8$ GeV. The gravity wave signal sourced at the PT then links Pulsar Timing Arrays with the PeV scale, LISA with the ZeV one, and the Einstein Telescope with grand unification.

2023-06-28, **Constraining MeV-scale axion-like particles with Fermi-LAT observations of SN 2023ixf**, Eike Müller et.al., [2306.16397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16397v1)

 The Fermi-LAT observations of SN 2023ixf, a Type II supernova in the nearby Pinwheel Galaxy, Messier 101 (M101), presents us with an excellent opportunity to constrain MeV-scale Axion-Like Particles (ALPs). By examining the photon decay signature from heavy ALPs that could be produced in the explosion, we improve the existing constraints on the ALP-photon coupling by up to a factor of $ \sim 2 $ for masses $ m\_a \lesssim 3 $ MeV, with the exact value depending mostly on plasma properties of the collapsing core. This study demonstrates the relevance of core-collapse supernovae, also beyond the Magellanic Clouds, as probes of fundamental physics.

2023-06-28, **Measuring Hubble constant in an anisotropic extension of $Λ$CDM model**, Vikrant Yadav et.al., [2306.16135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16135v1)

 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) independent approaches are frequently used in the literature to provide estimates of Hubble constant ($H\_0$). In this work, we report CMB independent constraints on $H\_0$ in an anisotropic extension of $\Lambda$CDM model using the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Chronometer (CC), and Pantheon+ compilation of Type Ia supernovae data. The analyses of the anisotropic model with different combinations of data sets reveal that anisotropy is strongly and positively correlated with $H\_0$, and an anisotropy of the order $10^{-14}$ in the anisotropic model yields values of $H\_0$ consistent with the direct local measurements.

2023-06-28, **Extreme data compression for Bayesian model comparison**, Alan F. Heavens et.al., [2306.15998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15998v1)

 We develop extreme data compression for use in Bayesian model comparison via the MOPED algorithm, as well as more general score compression. We find that Bayes factors from data compressed with the MOPED algorithm are identical to those from their uncompressed datasets when the models are linear and the errors Gaussian. In other nonlinear cases, whether nested or not, we find negligible differences in the Bayes factors, and show this explicitly for the Pantheon-SH0ES supernova dataset. We also investigate the sampling properties of the Bayesian Evidence as a frequentist statistic, and find that extreme data compression reduces the sampling variance of the Evidence, but has no impact on the sampling distribution of Bayes factors. Since model comparison can be a very computationally-intensive task, MOPED extreme data compression may present significant advantages in computational time.

 We examine spatial variations of the C$^0$/CO abundance ratio ($X\_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$) in the vicinity of the $\gamma$-ray supernova remnant W51C, based on [CI] ($^3P\_1$-$^3P\_0$), $^{12}$CO(1-0), and $^{13}$CO(1-0) observations with the ASTE and Nobeyama 45-m telescopes. We find that $X\_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ varies in a range of 0.02-0.16 (0.05 in median) inside the molecular clouds of $A\_V>$100 mag, where photodissociation of CO by the interstellar UV is negligible. Furthermore, $X\_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ is locally enhanced up to by a factor of four near the W51C center, depending on the projected distance from the W51C center. In high-$A\_V$ molecular clouds, $X\_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ is determined by the ratio of the cosmic-ray (CR) ionization rate to the H$\_2$ density, and we find no clear spatial variation of the H$\_2$ density against the projected distance. Hence, the high CR ionization rate may locally enhance $X\_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ near the W51C center. We also find that the observed spatial extent of the enhanced $X\_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ ($\sim$17 pc) is consistent with the diffusion distance of CRs with the energy of 100 MeV. The fact suggests that the low-energy CRs accelerated in W51C enhance $X\_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$. The CR ionization rate at the $X\_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$-enhanced cloud is estimated to be 3$\times$10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ on the basis of time-dependent PDR simulations of $X\_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$, the value of which is 30 times higher than that in the standard Galactic environment. These results demonstrate that [CI] is a powerful probe to investigate the interaction between CRs and the interstellar medium for a wide area in the vicinity of supernova remnants.

2023-06-28, **The effects of rotation, metallicity and magnetic field on the islands of failed supernovae**, Lei Li et.al., [2306.15879v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15879v1)

 Failed supernovae (FSN) are a possible channel for the formation of heavy stellar-mass black holes ($M\_{ BH}>\sim 30$ M$\_\odot$). However, the effects of metallicity, rotation and magnetic field on the islands of explodabilty of massive stars are not clear. Here, we simulate the stellar structure and evolution in the mass range between 6 and 55 $M\_{\odot}$ with different initial rotational velocities, metallicities, and magnetic fields from zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) to pre-collapse. We find that the rapid rotating stars can remain lower $\rm ^{12}C$ mass fraction at the time of C ignition, which allows the transition, from convective carbon burning to radiative burning, to occur at lower $M\_{\rm ZAMS}$ than those from stars without rotation. However, the rapid rotation is unfavorable for FSN occurring but is conducive to long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) because it results in the specific angular momentum in the CO core is greater than the last stable orbit at core collapse. The increasing metallicity does not affect FSN islands, but high metallicity inhibits rotational mixing and is unfavorable for producing lGRBs. A magnetic field can constrain the mass-loss rate even for rapid rotating stars, resulting in higher mass at pre-collapse. The magnetic braking triggered by the magnetic field can reduce the rotation velocity for high-metallicity models, which decreases the specific angular momentum in the CO core and is favorable for FSN occurring. We suggest that the heavy-mass black holes detected by LIGO may originate from rapidly rotating massive stars with strong magnetic fields, rather than those with very low metallicity.

 The ratio of H$\alpha$ to 1.4 GHz radio continuum intensities in the North Polar Spur (NPS) is measured to be $\lesssim 50$, two orders of magnitude smaller than the values observed in the typical shell-type old supernova remnants (SNRs), Cygnus Loop and S147, of $\sim 10^4$.The extremely low} H$\alpha$-to-radio intensity ratio favors the GC explosion model, which postulates a giant shock wave in the hot and low-density Galactic halo with low hydrogen recombination rate, over the local supernova(e) remnant model.

2023-06-27, **Mass distribution for single-lined hot subdwarf stars in LAMOST**, Zhenxin Lei et.al., [2306.15342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15342v1)

 Masses for 664 single-lined hot subdwarf stars identified in LAMOST were calculated by comparing synthetic fluxes from spectral energy distribution (SED) with observed fluxes from virtual observatory service. Three groups of hot subdwarf stars were selected from the whole sample according to their parallax precision to study the mass distributions. We found, that He-poor sdB/sdOB stars present a wide mass distribution from 0.1 to 1.0 $\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$ with a sharp mass peak around at 0.46 $\rm{M}\_{\odot}$, which is consistent with canonical binary model prediction. He-rich sdB/sdOB/sdO stars present a much flatter mass distribution than He-poor sdB/sdOB stars and with a mass peak around 0.42 $\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$. By comparing the observed mass distributions to the predictions of different formation scenarios, we concluded that the binary merger channel, including two helium white dwarfs (He-WDs) and He-WD + main sequence (MS) merger, cannot be the only main formation channel for He-rich hot subdwarfs, and other formation channels such as the surviving companions from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) could also make impacts on producing this special population, especially for He-rich hot subdwarfs with masses less than 0.44 $\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$. He-poor sdO stars also present a flatter mass distribution with an inconspicuous peak mass at 0.18 $\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$. The similar mass - $\Delta RV\_\mathrm{max}$ distribution between He-poor sdB/sdOB and sdO stars supports the scenario that He-poor sdO stars could be the subsequent evolution stage of He-poor sdB/sdOB stars.

2023-06-27, **A pre-explosion effervescent zone for the circumstellar material in SN 2023ixf**, Noam Soker et.al., [2306.15270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15270v1)

 I present the effervescent zone model to account for the compact dense circumstellar material (CSM) around the progenitor of the core collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 2023ixf. The effervescent zone is composed of bound dense clumps that are lifted by stellar pulsation and envelope convection to distances of tens AUs, and then fall back. The dense clumps provide most of the compact CSM mass and exist alongside the regular (escaping) wind. I crudely estimate that for a compact CSM within ~30 AU that contains ~0.01 Mo, the density of each clump is >3000 times the density of the regular wind at the same radius and that the total volume filling factor of the clumps is several percent. The clumps might cover only a small fraction of the CCSN photosphere in the first days post-explosion, accounting for the lack of strong narrow absorption lines. The long-lived effervescent zone is compatible with no evidence for outbursts in the years prior to SN 2023ixf explosion and the large-amplitude pulsations of its progenitor, and it is an alternative to the CSM scenario of several-years-long high mass loss rate wind.
