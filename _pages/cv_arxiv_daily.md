2024-08-29, **Non-detection of Neutrinos from the BOAT: Improved Constraints on the Parameters of GRB 221009A**, P. Veres et.al., [2408.16748v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16748v1)

 The IceCube neutrino observatory detects the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background with high significance, but the contribution of different classes of sources is not established. Because of their non-thermal spectrum, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are prime particle acceleration sites and one of the candidate classes for significant neutrino production. Exhaustive searches, based on stacking analysis of GRBs however could not establish the link between neutrinos and GRBs. Gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A had the highest time integrated gamma-ray flux of any detected GRB so far. The total fluence exceeds the sum of all Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) detected GRBs by a factor of two. Because it happened relatively nearby, it is one of the most favorable events for neutrino production from GRBs yet no neutrinos were detected. We calculate neutrino fluxes for this GRB in the TeV-PeV range using the most accurate, time-resolved spectral data covering the brightest intervals. We place limits on the physical parameters (Lorentz factor, baryon loading or emission radius) of the burst that are better by a factor of 2 compared to previous limits. The neutrino non-detection indicates a bulk Lorentz factor greater than 500 and possibly even 1000, consistent with other observations.

2024-08-29, **Chiral oscillations in quantum field theory**, Victor Bittencourt et.al., [2408.16742v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16742v1)

 Dirac particles have two intrinsic degrees-of-freedom, helicity and chirality. While helicity is conserved in time, chirality is not constant under time evolution for massive particles, yielding the phenomenon of chiral oscillations. So far, chiral oscillations have been mainly described in the framework of single particle relativistic quantum mechanics. In this paper, we present a quantum field theory approach to chiral oscillations in analogy with the one used to describe flavor mixing and oscillations. By taking the expectation value of chiral charges, we obtain the same chiral oscillation formula derived via standard relativistic quantum mechanics. We find that chiral charges are diagonalized by a Bogoliubov transformation: this implies that the vacuum for particles with definite chirality is orthogonal to the one for those with definite energy. In the case of neutrinos, our results can be further extended to include also flavor oscillations.

2024-08-29, **GRAND: status and perspectives**, Kumiko Kotera et.al., [2408.16316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16316v1)

 GRAND (the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) is a proposed next-generation observatory of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, cosmic rays, and gamma rays of cosmic origin, with energies exceeding about 100 PeV. GRAND is envisioned as a collection of large-scale ground arrays of self-triggered radio antennas that target the radio emission from extensive air showers initiated by UHE particles. Three prototype arrays are in operation: GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. They test the detection principle and technology of GRAND, in preparation for its next phase, consisting of two arrays of 10'000 antennas each, in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, to be deployed from 2030 on. We present the concept of GRAND, its science goals, the status of the prototypes, their first measurements, and the technical and scientific perspectives that these measurements open for the field.

2024-08-28, **The Standard Model of Particle Physics as an effective theory from two non-universal $U(1)$'s**, Richard H. Benavides et.al., [2408.16177v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16177v1)

 We study the possibility of obtaining the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics as an effective theory of a more fundamental one, whose electroweak sector includes two non-universal local $U(1)$ gauge groups, with the chiral anomaly cancellation taking place through an interplay among families. As a result of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, a massive gauge boson $Z'$ arises, which couples differently to the third family of fermions (by assumption, we restrict ourselves to the scenario in which the $Z'$ couples in the same way to the first two families). Two Higgs doublets and one scalar singlet are necessary to generate the SM fermion masses and break the gauge symmetries. We show that in our model, the flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) of the Higgs sector are identically zero if each right-handed SM fermion is only coupled with a single Higgs doublet. This result represents a FCNC cancellation mechanism different from the usual procedure in Two-Higgs Doublet Models~(2HDM). The non-universal nature of our solutions requires the presence of three right-handed neutrino fields, one for each family. Our model generates all elements of the Dirac mass matrix for quarks and leptons, which is quite non-trivial for non-universal models. Thus, we can fit all the masses and mixing angles with two scalar doublets. Finally, we show the distribution of solutions for the scalar boson masses in our model by scanning well-motivated intervals for the model parameters. We consider two possibilities for the scalar potential and compare these results with the Higgs-like resonant signals recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC. Finally, we also report collider, electroweak, and flavor constraints on the model parameters.

2024-08-28, **Discrete Leptonic Flavor Symmetries: UV Mediators and Phenomenology**, Ajdin Palavrić et.al., [2408.16044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16044v1)

 Given the absence of a definitive top-down indication for understanding the peculiar structure of the lepton sector, discrete flavor symmetries offer a profound perspective for examining the intricate patterns of lepton masses and mixings. In this work, drawing upon previous studies on the interplay of flavor symmetries with the potential UV completions from a purely bottom-up perspective, three well-motivated discrete flavor groups, suitable for portraying the leptonic sector as well as the neutrino masses, specifically $A\_4$, $A\_5$ and $S\_4$, are explored within this framework, leading to the comprehensive classification of the NP mediators, along with the tree-level matching relations onto dimension-6 SMEFT operators. Particular emphasis is placed on the discrete leptonic directions, for which a phenomenological analysis is carried out in order to constrain various NP mediators, where significant focus is directed towards the examination of the cLFV operators, which, for the wide range of applicable cases, offer the leading constraint.

2024-08-28, **Constraints on the properties of $ν$MSM dark matter using the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way**, Oliver Newton et.al., [2408.16042v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16042v1)

 Low-mass galaxies provide a powerful tool with which to investigate departures from the standard cosmological paradigm in models that suppress the abundance of small dark matter structures. One of the simplest metrics that can be used to compare different models is the abundance of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way. Viable dark matter models must produce enough substructure to host the observed number of Galactic satellites. Here, we scrutinize the predictions of the neutrino Minimal Standard Model ($\nu{\rm MSM}$), a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model of particle physics in which the production of sterile neutrino dark matter is resonantly enhanced by a lepton asymmetry in the primordial plasma. This process enables the model to evade current constraints associated with non-resonantly produced dark matter. Independently of assumptions about galaxy formation physics we rule out, with at least 95 per cent confidence, all parameterizations of the $\nu{\rm MSM}$ with sterile neutrino rest mass, $M\_{\rm s} \leq 1.4\, {\rm keV}$. Incorporating physically motivated prescriptions of baryonic processes and modelling the effects of reionization strengthen our constraints, and we exclude all $\nu{\rm MSM}$ parameterizations with $M\_{\rm s} \leq 4\, {\rm keV}$. Unlike other literature, our fiducial constraints do not rule out the putative 3.55 keV X-ray line, if it is indeed produced by the decay of a sterile neutrino; however, some of the most favoured parameter space is excluded. If the Milky Way satellite count is higher than we assume, or if the Milky Way halo is less massive than $M^{\rm MW}\_{200} = 8 \times 10^{11}\, {\rm M\_\odot}$, we rule out the $\nu{\rm MSM}$ as the origin of the 3.55 keV excess. In contrast with other work, we find that the constraints from satellite counts are substantially weaker than those reported from X-ray non-detections.

2024-08-28, **Non-holomorphic Modular $S_4$ Lepton Flavour Models**, Gui-Jun Ding et.al., [2408.15988v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15988v1)

 In the formalism of the non-supersymmetric modular invariance approach to the flavour problem the elements of the Yukawa coupling and fermion mass matrices are expressed in terms of polyharmonic Maa{\ss} modular forms of level $N$ in addition to the standard modula forms of the same level and a small number of constant parameters. Non-trivial polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms exist for zero, negative and positive integer modular weights. Employing the finite modula group $S\_4$ as a flavour symmetry group and assuming that the three left-handed lepton doublets furnish a triplet irreducible representation of $S\_4$, we construct all possible 7- and 8-parameter lepton flavour models in which the neutrino masses are generated either by the Weinberg effective operator or by the type I seesaw mechanism. We identify the phenomenologically viable models and obtain predictions for each of these models for the neutrino mass ordering, the absolute neutrino mass scale, the Dirac and Majorana CP-violation phases and, correspondingly, for the sum of neutrino masses and the neutrinoless double beta decay effective Majorana mass. We comment on how these models can be tested and conclude that they are all falsifiable. Detailed analyses are presented in the case of three representative benchmark lepton flavour scenarios.

2024-08-28, **Reconstruction of highly inclined extensive air showers in GRAND**, Oscar Macias et.al., [2408.15952v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15952v1)

 The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect highly inclined extensive air showers (EAS) with down-going and up-going trajectories. Several working groups in the GRAND collaboration are developing methods to reconstruct the incoming direction, core position, primary energy, and composition of the showers. The reconstruction pipeline -- currently under development in the France/IAP working group -- relies on a model of spherical wavefront emission for arrival times, which is possible because the radio signals are generated far away from the antenna stations. The amplitude distribution of the signals at the antenna level is described by an Angular Distribution Function that considers various asymmetries in the data, including geomagnetic effects. In this contribution, we present preliminary results from testing our EAS reconstruction procedure using realistic mock observations.

2024-08-28, **Probing Lorentz invariance with a high-energy neutrino flare**, Mauricio Bustamante et.al., [2408.15949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15949v1)

 Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the 2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or 10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.

2024-08-28, **Hybrid Type-II and Type-III seesaw model for the muon $g-2$ anomaly**, Lei Cai et.al., [2408.15910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15910v1)

 In this work, we investigate the muon anomalous dipole moment $a\_\mu$ in a model that extends the Standard Model with a scalar triplet and a vector-like lepton triplet. Different from previous studies, we find that there is still viable parameter space in this model to explain the discrepancy $\Delta a\_\mu=a\_{\mu}(\mathrm{Exp})-a\_{\mu}(\mathrm{SM})$. While being consistent with the current data of neutrino mass, precision electroweak measurements and the perturbativity of couplings, our model can provide new physics contribution $a\_\mu^\textrm{NP}$ to cover the central region of $\Delta a\_\mu$ with new scalar and fermion mass as low as around TeV. This mass scale is allowed by the current collider searches for doubly charged scalars and vector-like leptons, and they can be tested at future high energy and/or high luminosity colliders.

2024-08-28, **A roadmap for neutrino detection at LHC, HL-LHC and SPS**, Elena Graverini et.al., [2408.15851v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15851v1)

 SND@LHC is a new detector for neutrino physics at LHC. Its experimental configuration makes it possible to distinguish between all three neutrino flavours, opening a unique opportunity to probe physics of heavy flavour production at the LHC in the region that is not accessible to ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. It can also explore lepton flavour universality in the neutral sector, and search for feebly interacting particles. The detector has been commissioned and installed in 2021-2022. A first set of data has since then been collected, providing the first observation of neutrinos produced at a collider. This paper discusses the detector technologies being used to study high-energy neutrinos at the LHC, and their performance in terms of physics reach. The necessary upgrades to operate at high-luminosity LHC are presented, as well as a proposed experiment to perform neutrino measurements at the newly approved Beam Dump Facility.

2024-08-28, **Study of CP Violation in charm decays**, Felipe Cesário Laterza Lopes et.al., [2408.15525v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15525v1)

 The violation of the Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry is a phenomenon described by the Standard Model (SM), however, its predictions for this violation are not enough to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the visible universe. Experimentally, CP violation in hadronic decays had already been observed in various circumstances before 2019, when the LHCb experiment at CERN first published results reporting CPV in D-meson decays [arXiv:1903.08726v2] ($D^0 \to K^- K^+$ and $D^0 \to \pi^- \pi^+$). In this work, a study of CP violation is carried out analysing the phenomenology of charm decays. The study of such topic is guided by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix and the process of flavour changing decays caused by the weak interaction (focusing on charm decays). The symmetries attributed to physical conservation laws were recognized, allowing for the possibilities of CP violation predicted by the SM to be examined more closely. Such theoretical studies are then compared to the results obtained by the LHCb Collaboration. Furthermore, a comparison between CPV in charm decays and in neutrino oscillations is made, analysing the CP violating phase in both the CKM and the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrices.

2024-08-28, **Phenomenological study of heavy neutral gauge boson in the left-right symmetric model at future muon collider**, Zongyang Lu et.al., [2408.15471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15471v1)

 The exotic neutral gauge boson is a powerful candidate for the new physics beyond the standard model. As a promising model, the left-right symmetric model has been proposed to explain the neutrino mass, dark matter, and matter-antimatter asymmetry, etc., in which exotic gauge bosons $Z^\prime, W^{\prime \pm}$ have been put forward as well as other new right-handed particles. We investigate the $\mu^+ \mu^- \to q\bar{q} $ and $ \mu^+ \mu^- \to l^+ l^- $ processes involving the $Z^\prime$ boson as an intermediate particle. The coupling strength, decay width and mass are the key parameters on the production and decay processes of the $Z^\prime$ boson. The results indicate that the angular distributions of final particles are sensitive to the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to the other fermions. Asymmetries defined from the angular distributions are ideal quantities to demonstrate the discrepancy between the standard model process and the processes with $Z^\prime$ participated and they are also appropriate observables to discriminate the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to other particles. Compared with the current results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the future muon collider has a great potential to explore the new parameter space with $Z^\prime$ boson.

2024-08-29, **Strange stars admixed with dark matter: equiparticle model in a two fluid approach**, Isabella Marzola et.al., [2408.16583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16583v1)

 In this work we explore the possible scenario of strange stars admixed with fermionic or bosonic dark matter. For the description of the ``visible'' sector, we use a specific phenomenological quark model that takes into account in-medium effects for the quark masses through a suitable baryonic density dependence, in which the free parameters are chosen from the analysis of the stellar matter stability window (parametrizations presenting lower energy per baryon than iron nuclei). In the case of the dark sector, we investigate the predictions of fermionic and bosonic models. In the former we consider a spin $1/2$ dark particle, and the latter is described by a dark scalar meson. Both models present a repulsive vector interaction, particularly important for the bosonic model since it helps avoiding the collapse of the star due to the lack of the degeneracy pressure. Our results point out to possible stable strange stars configurations in agreement with data from PSR~J0030+0451, PSR~J0740+6620, NICER and HESS~J1731-347. As another feature, we find stars with dark matter halo configurations for lower values of the dark particle mass.

2024-08-29, **A Compaction Function Analysis of CMB $μ$ distortion Constraints on Primordial Black Holes**, Junyue Yang et.al., [2408.16579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16579v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are considered viable candidates for dark matter and the seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with their fruitful physical influences providing significant insights into the conditions of the early Universe. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) $\mu$ distortion tightly constrain the abundance of PBHs in the mass range of $10^4 \sim 10^{11} M\_{\odot}$ recently, limiting their potential to serve as seeds for the SMBHs observed. Given that $\mu$ distortion directly constrain the primordial power spectrum, it is crucial to employ more precise methods in computing PBH abundance to strengthen the reliability of these constraints. By a Press-Schechter (PS) type method utilizing the compaction function, we find that the abundance of PBHs could be higher than previously estimated constraints from $\mu$ distortion observations. Furthermore, our analysis shows that variations in the shape of the power spectrum have a negligible impact on our conclusions within the mass ranges under consideration. This conclusion provides us a perspective for further research on the constrain of PBH by $\mu$ distortion.

2024-08-29, **Static Planck stars from effective loop quantum gravity**, Edward Wilson-Ewing et.al., [2408.16533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16533v1)

 Effective loop quantum gravity dynamics are derived for spherically symmetric spacetimes with a perfect fluid matter content. For homogeneous spacetimes, the effective dynamics agree with the standard results of loop quantum cosmology, while the equations for static solutions give an effective Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. There exist solutions to the effective Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation that have a mass of the order of the Planck mass, a Planckian radius, and no horizon; these miniature stars could potentially contribute to dark matter, and could be an end state for an evaporating black hole.

2024-08-29, **Gravitational waves from thermal heavy scalar dark matter**, Parsa Hossein Ghorbani et.al., [2408.16475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16475v1)

 We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around $1-10$ TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase tyransition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $0.1$ Hz.

2024-08-29, **Future targets for light gauge bosons from cosmic strings**, Hanyu Cheng et.al., [2408.16334v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16334v1)

 Cosmic strings, theoretical one-dimensional topological defects from the early universe, provide a valuable opportunity for exploring dark matter (DM) production and gravitational wave (GW) emission. Our study investigates the production of gauge bosons and GW emission from cosmic string decay, considering the constraints imposed by cosmological observations. We specifically examine how gauge bosons radiated from strings contribute to DM and dark radiation, with limits set by the observed DM abundance and cosmic microwave background data, respectively. Additionally, we analyze the gravitational wave spectrum of this model across both low and high frequencies. Notably, the spectrum typically follows a $f^{-1/3}$ pattern at high frequencies, beyond the pivot frequency $f\_*$. We derive an analytical expression for the frequency $f\_*$ and confirm its accuracy through numerical verification. Furthermore, we compare the GW spectrum of this model with the forecasted capabilities of future GW observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, the Big Bang Observer, and $\mu$Ares. Finally, we discuss how these considerations impact the model parameters, specifically the gauge boson mass and the energy scale of U(1) symmetry breaking, providing insights into how cosmic strings could enhance our understanding of DM and GW astronomy.

2024-08-28, **Improved Treatment of Bosonic Dark Matter Dynamics in Neutron Stars: Consequences and Constraints**, Koushik Dutta et.al., [2408.16091v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16091v1)

 It is conceivable that a bosonic dark matter (DM) with non-gravitational interactions with SM particles will be accumulated at the center of a neutron star (NS) and can lead to black hole formation. In contrast to previous works with a fixed NS temperature, we dynamically determine the formation of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) for a given set of DM parameters, namely the DM-neutron scattering cross-section ($\sigma\_{\chi n}$), the thermal average of DM annihilation cross-section ($\langle\sigma v\rangle$) and the DM mass ($m\_\chi$). For both non-annihilating and annihilating DM with $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-26}{~\rm cm^3~ s^{-1}}$, the BEC forms for $m\_\chi \lesssim 10 ~{\rm TeV}$. In case of non-annihilating DM, observations of old NS allow $\sigma\_{\chi n}\lesssim 10^{-52}~{\rm cm^2}$ for $10 {~\rm MeV} \leq m\_{\chi} \lesssim 10 {~\rm GeV}$ (with BEC) and $\sigma\_{\chi n}\lesssim 10^{-47}~{\rm cm^2}$ for $5 {~\rm TeV} \lesssim m\_\chi \lesssim 30 {~\rm PeV} $ (without BEC). This analysis shows the mass window, $10 {~\rm GeV} \lesssim m\_\chi \lesssim 5 {~\rm TeV}$ unconstrained, subject only to direct detection experiments. In the annihilating DM scenario, the exclusion limits on DM parameters become weaker and even vanish for typical WIMP annihilation cross-section. However, the late-time heating of the NS enables us to probe the region with $\sigma\_{\chi n}\gtrsim 10^{-47}~{\rm cm^2}$, using the James Webb Space Telescope in the foreseeable future. When our results are viewed in the context of indirect searches of DM, it provides a lower limit on the $\langle\sigma v\rangle$, which is sensitive to the DM thermal state.

2024-08-28, **Boson Cloud Atlas: Direct Observation of Superradiance Clouds**, Majed Khalaf et.al., [2408.16051v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16051v1)

 Ultralight scalars emerge naturally in several motivated particle physics scenarios and are viable candidates for dark matter. While laboratory detection of such bosons is challenging, their existence in nature can be imprinted on measurable properties of astrophysical black holes (BHs). The phenomenon of superradiance can convert the BH spin kinetic energy into a bound cloud of scalars. In this letter, we propose a new technique for directly measuring the mass of a dark cloud around a spinning BH. We compare the measurement of the BH spin obtained with two independent electromagnetic techniques: continuum fitting and iron K$\alpha$ spectroscopy. Since the former technique depends on a dynamical observation of the BH mass while the latter does not, a mismatch between the two measurements can be used to infer the presence of additional extended mass around the BH. We find that a precision of $\sim 1\%$ on the two spin measurements is required to exclude the null hypothesis of no dark mass around the BH at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level for dark masses about a few percent of the BH mass, as motivated in some superradiance scenarios.

2024-08-28, **Search for ultralight dark matter in the SuperMAG high-fidelity dataset**, Matt Friel et.al., [2408.16045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16045v1)

 Ultralight dark matter, such as kinetically mixed dark-photon dark matter (DPDM) or axionlike-particle dark matter (axion DM), can source an oscillating magnetic-field signal at Earth's surface. Previous work searched for this signal in a publicly available dataset of global magnetometer measurements maintained by the SuperMAG collaboration. This "low-fidelity" dataset reported measurements with a 1-minute time resolution, allowing the search to set leading direct constraints on DPDM and axion DM with Compton frequencies $f\_\mathrm{DM}\leq1/(1\,\mathrm{min})$ [corresponding to masses $m\_\mathrm{DM}\leq7\times10^{-17}\,\mathrm{eV}$]. More recently, a dedicated experiment undertaken by the SNIPE Hunt collaboration has also searched for this same signal at higher frequencies $f\_\mathrm{DM}\geq0.5\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $m\_\mathrm{DM}\geq2\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$). In this work, we search for this signal of ultralight DM in the SuperMAG "high-fidelity" dataset, which features a 1-second time resolution, allowing us to probe the gap in parameter space between the low-fidelity dataset and the SNIPE Hunt experiment. The high-fidelity dataset exhibits lower geomagnetic noise than the low-fidelity dataset and features more data than the SNIPE Hunt experiment, making it a powerful probe of ultralight DM. Our search finds no robust DPDM or axion DM candidates. We set constraints on DPDM and axion DM parameter space for $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Hz}\leq f\_\mathrm{DM}\leq0.98\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $4\times10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}\leq m\_\mathrm{DM}\leq4\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$). Our results are the leading direct constraints on both DPDM and axion DM in this mass range, and our DPDM constraint surpasses the leading astrophysical constraint in a narrow range around $m\_{A'}\approx2\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$.

2024-08-28, **Gravitino Thermal Production, Dark Matter, and Reheating of the Universe**, Helmut Eberl et.al., [2408.16043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16043v1)

 We present a full one-loop calculation of the gravitino thermal production rate, beyond the so-called hard thermal loop approximation, using the corresponding thermal spectral functions in numerical form on both sides of the light cone. This framework requires a full numerical evaluation. We interpret our results within the framework of a general supergravity-based model, remaining agnostic about the specifics of supersymmetry breaking. In this context, assuming that gravitinos constitute the entirety of the dark matter in the Universe imposes strict constraints on the reheating temperature. For example, with a gluino mass at the current LHC limit, a maximum reheating temperature of $T\_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^9$ GeV is compatible with a gravitino mass of $m\_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV. Additionally, with a reheating temperature an order of magnitude lower at $T\_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^8$ GeV, the common gaugino mass $M\_{1/2}$ can range from $2$ to $4 $ TeV within the same gravitino mass range. For much higher values of $M\_{1/2}$, which are favored by current accelerator and cosmological data in the context of supersymmetric models, such as $M\_{1/2} = 10$ TeV, and for $m\_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV the reheating temperature compatible with the gravitino dark matter scenario is $ 10^7$ GeV. If other dark matter particles are considered, the reheating temperature could be much lower.

2024-08-28, **Orbital Dynamics of the Solar Basin**, Cara Giovanetti et.al., [2408.16041v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16041v1)

 We study the dynamics of the solar basin -- the accumulated population of weakly-interacting particles on bound orbits in the Solar System. We focus on particles starting off on Sun-crossing orbits, corresponding to initial conditions of production inside the Sun, and investigate their evolution over the age of the Solar System. A combination of analytic methods, secular perturbation theory, and direct numerical integration of orbits sheds light on the long- and short-term evolution of a population of test particles orbiting the Sun and perturbed by the planets. Our main results are that the effective lifetime of a solar basin at Earth's location is $\tau\_{\rm eff} = 1.20\pm 0.09 \,\mathrm{Gyr}$, and that there is annual (semi-annual) modulation of the basin density with known phase and amplitude at the fractional level of 6.5% (2.2%). These results have important implications for direct detection searches of solar basin particles, and the strong temporal modulation signature yields a robust discovery channel. Our simulations can also be interpreted in the context of gravitational capture of dark matter in the Solar System, with consequences for any dark-matter phenomenon that may occur below the local escape velocity.

2024-08-28, **Stochastic Dark Matter from Curvature Perturbations**, Raghuveer Garani et.al., [2408.15987v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15987v1)

 We investigate the production of dark matter from curvature perturbations produced during inflation or in standard cosmology, for example during first order phase transitions. Perturbations break Weyl flatness of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, allowing conformally coupled fields -- in particular fermions studied here -- to be produced even in the massless limit. Particle production can be computed by studying the Bogoliubov transformation induced by the stochastic background. For perturbations generated during inflation, we present a closed formula for the resulting abundance of particles that depends solely on the power spectrum of curvature perturbations at the end of inflation. This production mechanism can be dominant especially if the amplitude of curvature perturbations is enhanced for modes that exit the horizon towards the end of inflation. In the simplest scenario, the critical dark matter abundance is reproduced for $M \gtrsim 10^{6}$ GeV.

 Astronomical and cosmological observations indicate that dark matter should interact very weakly with the electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, the existence of such interactions is not precluded by observations nor by theoretical considerations. A promising approach to probe the dark matter electromagnetic properties is through the search of photon-mediated dark matter-nucleus interactions in direct detection experiments. In this paper we present a simple methodology to calculate the scattering rate in a direct detection experiment for given values of the dark matter electric charge, charge radius, electric- and magnetic- dipole moments and anapole moment. In our work we include contributions to the scattering from nuclear recoils and from the Migdal effect. We finally apply this formalism to determine exclusion limits on the five electromagnetic interactions using data from XENON1T, LZ, PICO-60 and DS50 experiments, and we discuss the implications for a simplified dark matter model with t-channel mediators.

 Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.

 We consider an atlas of leptophilic models with non-universal charges that combine the quantum numbers \((L\_e - L\_{\mu})\) and \((L\_{\mu} - L\_{\tau})\) in various realizations. We explore diverse manifestations of the atlas to understand their impact on explaining the muon \((g-2)\_{\mu}\) anomaly, as well as the origin of self-interacting dark matter, which serves as a feasible explanation for the small-scale challenges of cold dark matter. We found that a single vector gauge boson with mass range of $\sim 10~\mathrm{MeV}$ and non-universal couplings as indicated successfully mediates interactions in the fermion and dark matter sectors in such a way that $(g-2)\_{\mu}$ additional contribution agrees with experimental constraints and the self-interacting dark matter fluid behaves as suggested by observations at different astrophysical length scales. Furthermore, the model requires a dark matter candidate within $10-100~ \mathrm{GeV}$ order mass and a strong dark coupling ($g\_{\chi} \sim 0.3$, much stronger than the lepton's couplings $g'\_l \lesssim 10^{-4}$) to be a successful scenario to unravel astrophysical small scale problems.

 High-velocity stellar collisions near supermassive black holes may result in a complete disruption of the stars. The initial disruption can have energies on par with supernovae and power a very fast transient. In this work we examine the primary flare that will follow the initial transient, which arises when streams of gas from the disrupted stars travel around the central black hole and collide with each other on the antipodal side with respect to the original collision. We present a simple analytic estimate for the properties of the flare, which depends on the distance of the collision from the central black hole and on the center of mass velocity of the colliding stars. We also present first of their kind radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of a few examples of stellar collisions and post-collision flow of the ejected gas, and calculate the expected bolometric light curves. We find that such post-collision flares are expected to be similar to flares which arise in tidal disruptions events of single stars.

 Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) have been proposed as one of the progenitors for Type Ia supernovae. However, the exact origin of the quasi-periodic variability in the optical light curve remains a mystery.In this work, our goal is to investigate the effect of the feedback of an evolved main-sequence companion star on X-ray irradiation and find whether periodic X-ray irradiation of the companion star could reproduce periodic mass transfer.Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, we modeled the evolutionary track of the companion star under the influence of supersoft X-ray irradiation, and we calculated the resulting mass transfer rate. We find that the supersoft X-ray heating of the companion star can result in the expansion of the companion, causing it to greatly overflow its Roche lobe and thereby increasing the mass transfer rate. The periodic X-ray irradiation on the companion stars leads to periodic changes in the mass transfer rate. For a given companion star, higher irradiation efficiencies result in a higher mass transfer rate. Additionally, the mass transfer rate increases as the mass of the companion star decreases for a given irradiation efficiency. The companion star undergoing thermal timescale mass transfer is periodically irradiated by the X-rays from the WD, which can lead to periodic enhancement of the mass transfer rate. The mechanism could be the origin of the quasi-periodic optical light curve in supersoft X-ray sources.

 Dwarf galaxy streams encode vast amounts of information essential to understanding early galaxy formation and nucleosynthesis channels. Due to the variation in the timescales of star formation history in their progenitors, stellar streams serve as `snapshots' that record different stages of galactic chemical evolution. This study focusses on the Cetus stream, stripped from a low-mass dwarf galaxy. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of the chemical composition of 22 member stars based on their high-resolution spectra. We derived abundances for up to 28 chemical species from C to Dy and, for 20 of them, we account for the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium. We confirm that the Cetus stream has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-2.11$ $\pm$ 0.21. All observed Cetus stars are $\alpha$ enhanced with [$\alpha$/Fe] $\simeq$ 0.3. The absence of the $\alpha$-`knee' implies that star formation stopped before iron production in type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) became substantial. Neutron capture element abundances suggest that both the rapid (r-) and the main slow (s-) processes contributed to their origin. The decrease in [Eu/Ba] from a typical r-process value of [Eu/Ba] = 0.7 to 0.3 with increasing [Ba/H] indicates a distinct contribution of the r- and s-processes to the chemical composition of different Cetus stars. For barium, the r-process contribution varies from 100 % to 20 % in different sample stars, with an average value of 50 %. Our abundance analysis indicates that the star formation in the Cetus progenitor ceased after the onset of the main s-process in low- to intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars but before SNe Ia played an important role. A distinct evolution scenario is revealed by comparing the abundances in the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, showing the diversity in the chemical evolution of low-mass dwarf galaxies.

 Astrophysical simulations are computation, memory, and thus energy intensive, thereby requiring new hardware advances for progress. Stony Brook University recently expanded its computing cluster "SeaWulf" with an addition of 94 new nodes featuring Intel Sapphire Rapids Xeon Max series CPUs. We present a performance and power efficiency study of this hardware performed with FLASH: a multi-scale, multi-physics, adaptive mesh-based software instrument. We extend this study to compare performance to that of Stony Brook's Ookami testbed which features ARM-based A64FX-700 processors, and SeaWulf's AMD EPYC Milan and Intel Skylake nodes. Our application is a stellar explosion known as a thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernova and for this 3D problem, FLASH includes operators for hydrodynamics, gravity, and nuclear burning, in addition to routines for the material equation of state. We perform a strong-scaling study with a 220 GB problem size to explore both single- and multi-node performance. Our study explores the performance of different MPI mappings and the distribution of processors across nodes. From these tests, we determined the optimal configuration to balance runtime and energy consumption for our application.

2024-08-28, **Mapping the Outcomes of Stellar Evolution in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei**, Gaia Fabj et.al., [2408.16050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16050v1)

 The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are expected to be populated by numerous stars, either formed in the outer regions of the disk via gravitational instability, or captured from the nearby nuclear star cluster. Regardless of their formation mechanism, these stars experience altered evolutionary paths, mostly shaped by the accretion of dense disk material. In this study, through the comparison of different timescales, we chart the evolutionary outcomes of these AGN stars as a function of disk radius and across a range of supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, spanning from $10^6$ to $10^9 \rm M\_\odot$, for two popular AGN disk models. We find that, in the outer regions of the disk, stars evolve similarly to those in the interstellar medium, but in the inner and denser regions accretion quickly turns low-mass stars into massive stars, and their fate depends on just how quickly they accrete. If accretion occurs at a faster rate than nuclear burning, they can reach a quasi-steady `immortal' state. If stars accrete faster than they can thermally adjust, runaway accretion occurs, potentially preventing a quasi-steady state and altering the disk structure. During the AGN lifetime, in the regions of the disk that produce massive stars, supernovae (SNe) and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) may occur within the disk over a wide range of optical depths and ambient densities. Subsequently, in the final phase of the AGN, as the disk becomes depleted, formerly immortal stars will be unable to replenish their fuel, leading to additional SNe and GRBs.

2024-08-28, **The consequence of higher-order curvature-based constraints on $ f(R, L_m) $ gravity**, J. K. Singh et.al., [2408.16038v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16038v1)

 In this investigation, we perform an observational statistical analysis in the theory of $ f(R, L\_m) $ gravity. The proposed theoretical model is based on the Ricci scalar's non-linear contribution. We use a distinct parameterization for the deceleration parameter and constrain the model parameters by using various observational data. To determine the best-fit model for the cosmological parameters, we use different observational datasets such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Pantheon Supernova Survey, the Gold dataset, the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Furthermore, we study the late-time cosmic evolution of the Universe in detail and examine the implications of the constraint values on cosmological parameters. Additionally, we conduct a thorough comparison with the standard cosmological model $ \Lambda $CDM and other standard models obtained by Odintsov et al. \cite{Odintsov:2023cli, Odintsov:2024lid} to examine the validity of our proposed model in the low-redshift regimes. Finally, we find that the proposed model encapsulates an intriguing transition from early deceleration at high redshift to acceleration at low redshift, a quintessence dark energy scenario, and convergence towards the well-established $ \Lambda $CDM model in late-time Universe's evolution.

2024-08-28, **Particle acceleration, escape and non-thermal emission from core-collapse supernovae inside non-identical wind-blown bubbles**, Samata Das et.al., [2408.15839v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15839v1)

 In the core-collapse scenario, the supernova remnants evolve inside the complex wind-blown bubbles, structured by massive progenitors during their lifetime. Therefore, particle acceleration and the emissions from these SNRs can carry the fingerprints of the evolutionary sequences of the progenitor stars.   We time-dependently investigate the impact of the ambient environment of core-collapse SNRs on particle spectra and the emissions. We use the RATPaC code to model the particle acceleration at the SNRs with progenitors having ZAMS masses of 20 Msol and 60 Msol. We have constructed the pre-supernova circumstellar medium by solving the hydrodynamic equations for the lifetime of the progenitor stars. Then, the transport equation for cosmic rays, and magnetic turbulence in test-particle approximation along with the induction equation for the evolution of large-scale magnetic field have been solved simultaneously with the hydrodynamic equations for the expansion of SNRs inside the pre-supernova CSM.   The structure of the wind bubbles along with the magnetic field and the scattering turbulence regulate the spectra of accelerated particles for both SNRs. For the 60 Msol progenitor the spectral index reaches 2.4 even below 10 GeV during the propagation of the SNR shock inside the hot shocked wind. In contrast, we have not observed persistent soft spectra at earlier evolutionary stages of the SNR with 20 Msol progenitor, for which the spectral index becomes 2.2 only for a brief period. Later, the spectra become soft above ~10 GeV for both SNRs, as weak driving of turbulence permits the escape of high-energy particles from the remnants. The emission morphology of the SNRs strongly depends on the type of progenitors. For instance, the radio morphology of the SNR with 20 Msol progenitor is centre-filled at early stages whereas that for the more massive progenitor is shell-like.

2024-08-28, **Plasma diagnostics of supernova remnant 3C 400.2 by Suzaku observations**, Masataka Onuma et.al., [2408.15567v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15567v1)

 We report a result of plasma diagnostics of the supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 400.2, which has been reported to have a recombining plasma (RP) by previous studies. For careful background estimation, we simultaneously fitted spectra extracted from the SNR and background regions and evaluated the SNR emission contaminating the background-region spectrum as well as the background emission in the source-region spectrum. The SNR emission is explained by the collisional ionization equilibrium plasma originating from the interstellar medium and the ionizing plasma originating from the ejecta, in contrast to the previous studies. In addition, we found an unidentified X-ray source near the SNR, Suzaku J1937.4+1718, which is accompanied by an emission line at ~4.4~keV with the 2.8$\sigma$ confidence level. Since there is no striking atomic line at the energy in the rest frame, Suzaku J1937.4+1718 can be an extragalactic object with a redshifted Fe line.

2024-08-28, **Redshift evolution of the X-ray and UV luminosity relation of quasars: calibrated results from SNe Ia**, Xiaolei Li et.al., [2408.15547v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15547v1)

 Quasars could serve as standard candles if the relation between their ultraviolet and X-ray luminosities can be accurately calibrated. Previously, we developed a model-independent method to calibrate quasar standard candles using the distances-redshift relation reconstructed from Type Ia supernova at z<2 using Gaussian process regression. Interestingly, we found that the calibrated quasar standard candle dataset preferred a deviation from $\Lambda$CDM at redshifts above z>2. One interpretation of these findings is that the calibration parameters of the quasar UV-X-ray luminosity relationship evolves with redshift. In order to test the redshift dependence of the quasar calibration in a model-independent manner, we divided the quasar sample whose redshift overlap with the redshift coverage of Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation into two sub-samples: a low-redshift quasar sub-sample and a high-redshift quasar sub-sample. Our present results show that there is about a 4$\sigma$ inconsistency between the quasar parameters inferred from the high-redshift quasar sub-sample and from the low-redshift sub-sample if no evolution of the quasar relation is considered. This inconsistency suggests the necessity of considering redshift evolution for the relationship between the quasars$'$ ultraviolet and X-ray luminosities. We then test an explicit parametrization of the redshift evolution of the quasar calibration parameters via $\gamma(z) = \gamma\_0+\gamma\_1(1+z)$ and $\beta(z)=\beta\_0+\beta\_1(1+z)$. Combining this redshift-dependent calibration relationship with the distance-redshift relationship reconstructed from Pantheon+ supernova compilation, we find the high-redshift sub-sample and low-redshift sub-sample become consistent at the 1$\sigma$ level, which means that the parameterized form of $\gamma(z)$ and $\beta(z)$ works well at describing the evolution of the quasar calibration parameters.
