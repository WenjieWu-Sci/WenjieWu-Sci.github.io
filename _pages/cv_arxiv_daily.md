2026-02-05, **Poisson Log-Normal Process for Count Data Prediction**, Anushka Saha et.al., [2602.05926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05926v1)

 Modeling count data is important in physics and other scientific disciplines, where measurements often involve discrete, non-negative quantities such as photon or neutrino detection events. Traditional parametric approaches can be trained to generate integer-count predictions but may struggle with capturing complex, non-linear dependencies often observed in the data. Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a robust non-parametric alternative to modeling continuous data; however, it cannot generate integer outputs. We propose the Poisson Log-Normal (PoLoN) process, a framework that employs GP to model Poisson log-rates. As in GP regression, our approach relies on the correlations between data points captured via GP kernel structure rather than explicit functional parameterizations. We demonstrate that the PoLoN predictive distribution is Poisson-LogNormal and provide an algorithm for optimizing kernel hyperparameters. Furthermore, we adapt the PoLoN approach to the problem of detecting weak localized signals superimposed on a smoothly varying background - a task of considerable interest in many areas of science and engineering. Our framework allows us to predict the strength, location and width of the detected signals. We evaluate PoLoN's performance using both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the open dataset from CERN which was used to detect the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. Our results indicate that the PoLoN process can be used as a non-parametric alternative for analyzing, predicting, and extracting signals from integer-valued data.

2026-02-05, **Early-universe constraints on the electron mass**, Michela Garramone et.al., [2602.05720v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05720v1)

 We investigate the impact of a nonstandard electron mass $m\_e$ on early-Universe thermal history, focusing on neutrino decoupling and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). In the standard cosmology, neutrino--electron interactions keep neutrinos in thermal contact with the electromagnetic plasma until shortly before $e^\pm$ annihilation. Varying $m\_e$ shifts the decoupling epoch and the entropy transfer from $e^\pm$ annihilation, thereby modifying the neutrino energy density and the inferred effective number of relativistic species, $N\_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Independently, during BBN the rates of charged-current weak processes, and hence the neutron-to-proton ratio, depend on $m\_e$. By confronting BBN predictions for the primordial light-element abundances with observations and imposing cosmological constraints on $N\_{\mathrm{eff}}$, we obtain a bound on $m\_e$ in the early Universe of $m\_e = 0.504^{+0.007}\_{-0.006}$ MeV or $m\_e=0.510\pm0.007$ MeV ($1σ$), depending on the considered nuclear reaction network (NACRE II or PRIMAT, respectively). The allowed range is close to the present laboratory value at the level of 1.4\%, thus supporting the constancy of the electron mass over cosmological timescales.

2026-02-05, **Exploring the central engines of gamma-ray bursts from prompt light curves**, Xue Zhang et.al., [2602.05587v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05587v1)

 Hyperaccreting stellar-mass black hole systems are leading candidates for the central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Their jets are thought to be powered by either the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process or neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs), but discriminating between these mechanisms remains challenging. To address this, we propose using the luminosity decay slope (parameter d) of GRB light curves to distinguish between the BZ and NDAF mechanisms, thereby linking the light-curve morphology to the central engine physics. By analysing 85 single-peaked GRBs with fast-rise, exponential-decay (FRED) profiles observed by Swift/BAT using 64 ms background-subtracted light curves, we fit the decay slope (parameter d) with the empirical Kocevski-Ryde-Liang (KRL) function and compare the results with theoretical predictions for the BZ (d approximately 1.67) and the NDAF (d approximately 3.7 to 7.8) mechanisms. We find that the decay slope (parameter d) can differentiate central engine mechanisms, with 15 GRBs consistent with the BZ mechanism and 22 supporting the NDAF mechanism. However, most events exhibit slopes within the range between 2 and 4, suggesting a hybrid of mechanisms, with NDAF being dominant.

2026-02-05, **Neutrino mass ordering in JUNO at risk from scalar NSI induced resonance**, Sandhya Choubey et.al., [2602.05564v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05564v1)

 The determination of neutrino mass ordering (NMO) is the primary goal of the currently running JUNO reactor experiment. We show that the measurement of NMO at JUNO may severely deteriorate in the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions mediated by a beyond standard model scalar (SNSI). Taking inverted ordering and the lightest neutrino mass at $m\_l=0.01$ eV, the NMO sensitivity falls below $2σ$ for SNSI parameter values in the range $η\_{ee}< -7.1\times 10^{-3}$ and $η\_{ee} > 3.3\times 10^{-3}$. More importantly, for $η\_{ee} \gtrsim 5.7\times 10^{-3}$ the NMO sensitivity in JUNO is completely lost. We show that this is due to the presence of a hitherto unrecognized resonant enhancement of the mixing angle $θ\_{12}$, which gives rise to a mass ordering degeneracy.

2026-02-05, **Quantum Fisher Information Revealing Parameter Sensitivity in Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiments**, Bhavna Yadav et.al., [2602.05221v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05221v1)

 Determination of the leptonic CP-violating phase $δ\_{\mathrm{CP}}$, the atmospheric mixing angle $θ\_{23}$, and the mass-squared difference $Δm\_{31}^{2}$ constitutes a primary objective of current and next-generation long-baseline neutrino experiments. We employ QFI (QFI) to establish fundamental precision bounds on single-parameter estimation in three-flavor $ν\_μ\to ν\_e$ oscillations, treating the neutrino as an evolving pure quantum state. Computing QFI as a function of the baseline-to-energy ratio $L/E$ for benchmark parameter sets from NuFit-6.0, we find distinct sensitivity hierarchies and $L/E$-dependent structures. Specifically, $δ\_{\mathrm{CP}}$ and $θ\_{23}$ exhibit bimodal QFI profiles with peaks at $L/E \sim 500$ and $1500~\mathrm{km/GeV}$, corresponding to the first and second oscillation maxima, reaching $F\_Q(δ\_{\mathrm{CP}}) \sim 0.15$ and $F\_Q(θ\_{23}) \sim 15$, respectively. In contrast, $Δm\_{31}^{2}$ displays a unimodal structure peaking at $L/E \sim 1000$--$1200~\mathrm{km/GeV}$ with $F\_Q(Δm\_{31}^{2}) \sim 3 \times 10^{6}$, reflecting its role in setting the oscillation length scale.

2026-02-05, **LiFE-SNS: LiF Experiment for keV-scale Sterile Neutrino Search**, Y. C. Lee et.al., [2602.05161v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05161v1)

 The LiF Experiment for keV-scale Sterile Neutrino Search (LiFE-SNS) aims to probe sterile neutrinos through precision measurements of the tritium $β$ spectrum. Tritium nuclei are produced and embedded in LiF crystals via the ${}^{6}\mathrm{Li}(n,α){}^{3}\mathrm{H}$ reaction, allowing thermal calorimetric detection of $β$ decays with magnetic microcalorimeters (MMCs) operated at millikelvin temperatures. We present the detector configuration, background studies, and calibration method, including modeling of position-dependent response and characterization of detector nonlinearity. We also discuss potential sources of systematic uncertainty relevant to the sterile-neutrino search. While the first phase of LiFE-SNS has been completed, this paper focuses on calibration and detector characterization. The achieved performance enables precision $β$-spectrum measurements, and projected sensitivities indicate competitive reach in the keV mass region.

2026-02-05, **Novel Signatures of Heavy Neutral Lepton at Muon Collider**, Xue-Xin Zhang et.al., [2602.05158v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05158v1)

 The Higgs-strahlung process $\ell^+\ell^-\to Z h$ is one of the most important production channels of the standard model Higgs boson $h$ at the lepton colliders. The cross section reaches the maximum value slightly above the threshold $\sqrt{s}\sim m\_Z+m\_h$, and decreases as $\sim 1/s$ at high energies. In the gauged extension models, the new gauge boson $Z'$ and heavy Higgs boson $H$ exist after the symmetry breaking. The heavy Higgs-strahlung process $\ell^+\ell^-\to Z' H$ would also reach the maximum cross section around the threshold $\sqrt{s}\sim m\_{Z'}+m\_H$. Therefore, the future high energy lepton colliders, such as the TeV scale muon collider, are promising to probe this new process. If heavy neutral lepton $N$ is introduced to generate the tiny neutrino masses via seesaw mechanism, novel signatures could arise from $μ^+μ^-\to Z' H \to NN +NN \to 4 μ^\pm +4J$ and $μ^+μ^-\to Z' H \to μ^+μ^- +NN \to 3 μ^\pm μ^\mp +2J$, where the fat-jets $J$ come from the hadronic decay of $W$ bosons. In this paper, we investigate the same-sign tetralepton signature $4μ^\pm+4J$ and the same-sign trilepton signature $3μ^\pm μ^\mp + 2J$ at the 3 TeV and 10 TeV muon collider.

2026-02-05, **Solar Flares as a Probe of Neutrino Nature: Distinguishing Dirac and Majorana via Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession**, D. Delepine et.al., [2602.05149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05149v1)

 Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession (RSFP) of solar neutrinos is studied using the quantum density matrix formalism, explicitly taking into account collisional decoherence and solar matter density profiles. The transition probabilities for standard $^8$B solar neutrinos ($E \approx 10$ MeV) and ultra-high-energy flare neutrinos ($E \gtrsim 1$ GeV) under three magnetic field hypotheses: core-concentrated (Wood-Saxon), tachocline-confined (Gaussian), and turbulent convective (Power Law) are compared. For standard LMA parameters, we show the resonance for 10 MeV neutrinos is strictly confined to the deep solar core ($r < 0.2 R\_\odot$), rendering standard solar neutrinos insensitive to outer magnetic fields. Conversely, for 1 GeV flare neutrinos, the resonance shifts to the tachocline and convective zones, where strong fields ($B \sim 50$ kG) drive efficient spin conversion.   We apply this effect to compute the difference between Dirac or Majorana neutrino scattering cross section as electron-neutrino scattering and Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$ν$NS). We show that significant asymmetry in these cross section are possible allowing in case of detection to distinguish between Dirac or Majorana neutrinos. In case of null observation, we show that this method can potentially improved the limit on the neutrino magnetic moment by one order to magnitude compared to current limits.

2026-02-04, **Supernova Bursts as a Probe of Neutrino Nature via $CEνNS$ Coherent Scattering**, D. Delepine et.al., [2602.05055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05055v1)

 The Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession (RSFP) of core-collapse supernova neutrinos within the framework of the quantum density matrix formalism is studied. The cooling duration of SN1987A severely constraints standard RSFP models for Dirac Neutrinos. Using the properties of the outer stellar envelope where resonant conversion could occur after thermal decoupling, we show that for neutrino magnetic moments in the range $μ\_ν\sim 10^{-14} - 10^{-12} μ\_B$, adiabatic conversion in the envelope ($R > 1000$ km) leads to macroscopic helicity inversion without violating cooling bounds.This RSFP neutrino helicity change induces different signatures for Dirac or Majorana neutrinos in Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$ν$NS) detectors. For Dirac neutrino, a massive flux deficit for Dirac neutrinos due to sterile conversion should be seen. For Majorana neutrinos, the flux will not change but a modification to its spectral decomposition of the cross section should be seen due to the transition from left-handed electron neutrinos to right-handed $μ$ or $τ$ anti-neutrinos. An experimental strategy is proposed to minimize the astrophysical uncertainties using the high-energy neutrino tail ($E \approx 1$ GeV) which evades RSFP to normalize the signal. This ratio-based approach effectively cancels astrophysical uncertainties, allowing future detectors to distinguish the fundamental nature of the neutrino and probe magnetic moments down to $10^{-14} μ\_B$, two orders of magnitude beyond current solar limits.

2026-02-04, **Design and Linearity Assessment of the TRISTAN Detectors' Remote Analog to Digital Conversion DAQ System**, Andrew S. Gavin et.al., [2602.04976v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04976v1)

 The TRISTAN detector is an upgrade to the KATRIN experiment to enable a differential measurement of the tritium $β$-decay spectrum to search for the experimental signature of keV scale sterile neutrinos. The TRISTAN detector upgrade consists of performing precision electron spectroscopy with over 1000 silicon drift detector pixels, each responsible for recording event rates of $10^5$ counts per second. A project specific data acquisition (DAQ) system is developed to meet the experimental challenges with a remote analog to digital conversion (RADC) design. In this work, the conceptual design of the RADC DAQ is presented along with the built system for operating the TRISTAN detector upgrade. The system includes flexible signal processing logic and data management that is optimized for the high-rate precision measurement. The non-linearity of the system's readout channels are measured and shown to be stable over time. The systematic effect of this non-linearity is propagated to the sensitivity to the sterile neutrino signature and is demonstrated to be reducible to a subdominant contribution.

2026-02-04, **Primordial black holes as cosmic accelerators of light dark matter: Novel direct detection constraints**, Sk Jeesun et.al., [2602.04858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04858v1)

 Current multiton dark matter (DM) detectors are largely incapable of detecting light dark matter from the Galactic halo due to the energy threshold limitations of their recoil measurements. However, primordial black holes (PBHs) can evaporate via Hawking radiation to particles whose energies are set by the black hole temperature. Consequently, weakly interacting light dark matter (or dark radiation) particles produced in this manner can reach the Earth with sufficient flux and kinetic energy above the experimental thresholds. This opens up a novel avenue to probe the light dark sector in terrestrial experiments. In this work, we explore this possibility by considering fermionic DM produced through PBH evaporation and investigate its electron recoil signatures in direct detection experiments. We analyze both energy independent (constant) and energy dependent (scalar and vector mediated) DM-electron interactions, highlighting the strong dependence of the recoil spectra on the underlying Lorentz structure of the interaction. In addition, we also account for the attenuation effects due to loss of kinetic energy while DM traverses through Earth's crust, which can significantly modify the incoming DM flux. Incorporating these effects carefully, we place constraints on light DM using the electron recoil data from XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T. Finally, we also discuss the detection prospects of such dark matter in current and future generation neutrino detectors, such as Super Kamiokande and Hyper Kamiokande.

2026-02-04, **Exploring supernova neutrino mass ordering at DUNE via quantum entanglement**, Adikiran Johny et.al., [2602.04800v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04800v1)

 The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) offers strong sensitivity to neutrinos from a Galactic core collapse supernova, providing a powerful probe of neutrino flavor conversion and the neutrino mass ordering. In this work, we study supernova neutrino oscillations at DUNE using quantum entanglement as an organizing framework. Treating the three flavor neutrino system as an effective multipartite quantum state, we quantify flavor correlations through the entanglement of formation, concurrence, and negativity, expressed directly in terms of flavor survival and transition probabilities. Benchmark scenarios defined by representative variations of the electron neutrino survival probability are constructed for each entanglement measure. Event rates and fluences are computed for a supernova at 10 kpc, and the mass ordering sensitivity is evaluated using detector-level simulations performed with the \texttt{SNOwGLoBES} framework, employing the Garching supernova flux model and including the dominant detection channels in liquid argon: $ν\_e$ and $\barν\_e$ charged-current interactions on argon and elastic scattering on electrons. We analyze both individual and combined detection channels and incorporate $5\%$ normalization and energy calibration systematic uncertainties. Our results show that DUNE achieves a $5σ$ determination of the neutrino mass ordering for a supernova at distances of $\sim 20$~kpc for the $ν\_e$ charged current channel and $\sim 2$~kpc for the $\barν\_e$ channel, with the reach depending on the entanglement scenario considered. These results demonstrate that entanglement based observables provide a complementary and robust framework for probing supernova neutrino oscillations and the neutrino mass ordering.

2026-02-04, **Near-Resonant Thermal Leptogenesis**, Angus Spalding et.al., [2602.04772v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04772v1)

 We study leptogenesis in the quasi-degenerate but non-resonant regime. Expanding the CP asymmetry parameter near degeneracy and imposing the conservative non-resonance condition that the mass splitting must be much greater than the right-handed neutrino decay rates $ΔM > 100Γ\_i$, yields the universal upper bound $ε\leq 1/200$, independent of both the effective neutrino masses and the right-handed neutrino mass. We investigate vanilla and flavoured near-resonant leptogenesis and find that successful leptogenesis by right-handed neutrino decays can occur for $M \gtrsim 100~\mathrm{GeV}$ independent of washout regime, extending the viable parameter space of thermal leptogenesis down to the electroweak scale without invoking resonance. We also analyse near-resonant thermal leptogenesis during reheating and show that successful baryon asymmetry generation is compatible with reheating temperatures as low as $T\_{RH}\simeq 10\rm GeV$ without relying on non-thermal production. Finally, we present a consistent framework for incorporating flavour effects in near-resonant leptogenesis during reheating. Overall, near-resonant thermal leptogenesis offers a controlled alternative regime to resonant leptogenesis, lowering the leptogenesis scale to the electroweak scale, without reliance on a disputed regulator used in resonant leptogenesis.

2026-02-04, **Benchmark Study of CEvNS Nuclear Recoil Observables for B, Mg, Ti, and Zr Targets Using Geant4**, Yusuf Havvat et.al., [2602.04771v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04771v1)

 Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) provides a well-defined framework for studying nuclear recoil observables in low-energy neutrino interactions. In this work, we present a comparative Monte Carlo benchmark study of CEvNS-induced nuclear recoils for four target nuclei (B, Mg, Ti, and Zr) using the Geant4 simulation toolkit and the ROOT analysis framework. The study focuses on relative differences in recoil-energy spectra, nuclear form-factor effects, and angular distributions under identical simulation conditions. A deliberately simplified detector geometry is employed to ensure a controlled and transparent comparison between target materials, rather than to model a specific experimental setup. The results highlight how nuclear mass and form-factor suppression influence CEvNS recoil observables and provide a reference-level comparison that may be useful for material-selection studies in CEvNS-related simulations.

2026-02-04, **Charged lepton flavor violating decays $Z\to \ell_α\ell_β$ in the inverse seesaw**, Adrián González-Quiterio et.al., [2602.04168v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04168v1)

 After confirmation of massiveness and mixing of neutrinos, by neutrino oscillation data, the origin of neutrino mass and the occurrence of charged-lepton-flavor non-conservation in nature have become two main objectives for the physics of elementary particles. Taking inspiration from both matters, we address the decays $Z\to\ell\_α\ell\_β$, with $\ell\_α\ne\ell\_β$, thus violating charged-lepton flavor. We calculate the set of contributing one-loop diagrams characterized by virtual neutral leptons, both light and heavy, emerged from the inverse seesaw mechanism for the generation of neutrino mass. By neglecting charged-lepton and light-neutrino masses, and then assuming that the mass spectrum of the heavy neutral leptons is degenerate, we find that a relation $\textrm{Br}\big( Z\to\ell\_α\ell\_β\big)\propto\big\| η\_{βα} \big\|^2$, with $η$ the matrix describing non-unitarity effects in light-lepton mixing, is fulfilled. Our quantitative analysis, which considers both scenarios of degenerate and non-degenerate masses of heavy neutral leptons, takes into account upper bounds on $η\_{μe}$, imposed by current constraints on the decay $μ\to eγ$ from the MEG II experiment, while projected future sensitivity of this experiment is considered as well. We find that, even though current constraints on $Z\to\ell\_α\ell\_β$, by the ATLAS Collaboration, remain far from inverse-seesaw contributions, improved sensitivity from in-plans machines, such as the Future Circular Collider and the Circular Electron Positron Collider, shall be able to probe this mass-generating mechanism through these decays.

2026-02-05, **Improved Heavy Dark Matter Annihilation Search from Dwarf Galaxies with HAWC**, A. Albert et.al., [2602.05955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05955v1)

 Understanding dark matter's elusive nature is crucial for the framework of particle physics and expanding the Standard Model. This analysis utilizes the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma ray Observatory to indirectly search for dark matter (DM) by studying gamma ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Selected for their high ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter, dSphs are useful for this type of search owing to the low background emission. In comparison to previous HAWC studies, we significantly improve our sensitivity to DM from dSphs due to improvements to our event reconstruction and reduced hadronic contamination. We expanded the number of dSphs studied, DM annihilation channels into the Standard Model (SM), and the amount of data collected on each previously studied dSph. We searched for DM signals in each dSph using the latest version of the algorithms used to reconstruct data from the primary detector of the HAWC instrument. We report that we do not detect evidence of DM from dSphs, so we place upper limits for the velocity-weighted DM annihilation cross-section ($\langleσv \rangle$) on the order of $10^{-23}~\text{cm}^3\text{s}^{-1}$ for a DM mass range of $1-10^4$ TeV.

2026-02-05, **Early growth of massive black holes in dynamical dark energy models with negative cosmological constant**, N. Menci et.al., [2602.05921v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05921v1)

 Recent results from combined cosmological probes indicate that the Dark Energy component of the Universe could be dynamical. The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter $Ω\_{DE}=Ω\_Λ+Ω\_{x}$ results from the contribution of the ground state energy $Ω\_Λ$ and the scalar field energy $Ω\_{x}$. Provided that $Ω\_{DE}\approx 0.7$, negative values of $Ω\_Λ$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z> 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $ΛCDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M\_{BH}\gtrsim 10^7\,M\_{\odot}$ observed at $z\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative $Ω\_Λ$ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass $M\_{seed}\sim 10^2\,M\_{\odot}$ originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $Ω\_Λ\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin.

2026-02-05, **Microlensing constraint on Primordial Black Hole abundance with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam observations of Andromeda**, Sunao Sugiyama et.al., [2602.05840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05840v1)

 We present updated microlensing analysis results based on high-cadence ($\sim$2~min) Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in 2014, 2017, and 2020, yielding a total of 39.3 hours of data. We use a point-lens finite-source model for the microlensing light curve model and employ multi-stage selection procedures to identify microlensing candidates. From more than 25,000 variable candidates detected across all nights, we identify 12 microlensing candidates with light-curve timescales shorter than 5~hours, and among them, 4 secure candidates with high-significance detections. We estimate detection efficiencies using light-curve-level simulations that account for observational conditions and finite-source effects. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that combines the light-curve fitting information for each candidate with the Poisson statistics of the number of candidates, we derive constraints on parameters that characterize the abundance and mass scale of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. First, we derive upper limits on the PBH abundance under the null hypothesis that all events are assumed to be false detections. Next, employing the PBH hypothesis in which all (or only secure) candidates are assumed to be due to PBH microlensing, we derive the allowed region of the PBH parameters; the inferred mass scale is $M\_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-7}$--$10^{-6}M\_\odot$, and the PBH abundance to the total dark matter is $f\_{\rm PBH}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-2}{\rm -}10^{-1})$. Our results demonstrate that HSC-M31 monitoring remains a uniquely powerful probe of PBHs, and highlight the need for further studies for example, using Rubin Observatory LSST observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud.

2026-02-05, **STProtein: predicting spatial protein expression from multi-omics data**, Zhaorui Jiang et.al., [2602.05811v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05811v1)

 The integration of spatial multi-omics data from single tissues is crucial for advancing biological research. However, a significant data imbalance impedes progress: while spatial transcriptomics data is relatively abundant, spatial proteomics data remains scarce due to technical limitations and high costs. To overcome this challenge we propose STProtein, a novel framework leveraging graph neural networks with multi-task learning strategy. STProtein is designed to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression using more accessible spatial multi-omics data, such as spatial transcriptomics. We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences. This tool enables scientists to accelerate discovery by identifying complex and previously hidden spatial patterns of proteins within tissues, uncovering novel relationships between different marker genes, and exploring the biological "Dark Matter".

2026-02-05, **Extended Haloscope Search and Candidate Validation near 1.036G Hz**, Saebyeok Ahn et.al., [2602.05388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05388v1)

 We report a follow-up axion haloscope search near 1.036 GHz that completes and extends our previous work [Phys. Rev. X 14, 031023 (2024)], in which a portion of the HEMT-based data could not be analyzed due to unrecorded experimental information. While recovering this dataset, we identified an excess near 1.036 GHz that satisfied our candidate-selection criteria, motivating dedicated validation studies, including independent cross-checks and re-examination with the original apparatus. The excess did not persist under these investigations and was not confirmed as an axion dark-matter signal. We subsequently extended the search over a 20-MHz band surrounding the candidate using a quantum-noise-limited amplifier, achieving sensitivity close to the Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky benchmark. In the absence of a confirmed signal, we set improved 90% confidence-level upper limits on the axion-photon coupling over the frequency range 1.026-1.045 GHz. This work highlights the importance of robust candidate-validation strategies as haloscope searches approach discovery-level sensitivity.

2026-02-05, **Effects of nonlinear interactions on the superradiant instability of charged black holes**, Bo-Wen Qin et.al., [2602.05268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05268v1)

 A Reissner-Nordström black hole (RNBH) enclosed in a cavity is known to be superradiantly unstable to charged scalar perturbations below a critical frequency. Inspired by the emergence of the QCD axion as a prominent dark matter candidate, we construct a model featuring an axion field coupled to an electromagnetic field that undergoes superradiant growth around an RNBH. Utilizing numerical relativity, we achieve stable, long-term evolution of this system and perform a comparative analysis across various parameter spaces. Our comprehensive investigation reveals the formation of a hairy black hole, whose final state is governed by a diverse set of physical parameters. Notably, the decay constant in the axion potential, representing nonlinear interactions, bifurcates the superradiant instability into two distinct behavioral regimes, leading to more significant dynamical shifts than previously reported. Furthermore, we examine the influence of the scalar field's charge and mass, as well as the mirror's position. We investigate the axionic bosenova process and observe a long-term beating pattern of the axion field induced by nonlinear interactions. By fine-tuning these parameter combinations, we demonstrate that the system can evolve toward a variety of distinct physical endpoints.

2026-02-04, **Growth of High-Redshift Quasars from Fermion Dark Matter Seeds**, Yu Wang et.al., [2602.05135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05135v1)

 Quasars hosting $\gtrsim 10^{9}\,M\_\odot$ black holes at $z>6$ challenge growth scenarios that start from light seeds and assume accretion within already formed galaxies. Motivated by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs), which suggests that $\sim 10^{6}\,M\_\odot$ black holes can be active in compact, pre-galactic environments, we revisit early black hole growth with a minimal cosmology-based framework. We model the accretion history as the smaller of the Bondi inflow rate and the Eddington-limited rate, where the Bondi rate is set by the supply of overdense primordial gas whose density declines with cosmic expansion, and the Eddington rate captures regulation by radiative feedback. By fitting the observed masses and luminosities of J0313--1806 ($z=7.64$) and J0100+2802 ($z=6.30$) with Bayesian inference, we infer initial conditions that favor massive seed black holes with initial mass $M\_0 \sim 10^{6}\,M\_\odot$, formed at $z\sim20{-}30$ in environments with baryonic overdensity factors $f\_ρ\gtrsim 50$ relative to the cosmic mean. The resulting growth histories include a prolonged supply-limited stage, and they reproduce the observed quasar masses without requiring sustained Eddington accretion or any super-Eddington episodes. The inferred seed mass scale is consistent with black holes produced by the collapse of quantum-degenerate fermion dark matter cores, providing a physically defined pathway to massive seeds at the redshifts implied by LRD phenomenology.

 Cosmic voids, the largest underdense regions in the Universe, provide unique laboratories for studying galaxy formation and constitute powerful probes of cosmology. Recent work has shown that individual galaxy bias (b\_i), which quantifies how each galaxy traces the underlying dark matter field, exhibits a characteristic radial dependence within spherical voids, defining a void bias profile in which galaxies near void centers display systematically lower bias values. We investigate how the environmental modulation of individual galaxy bias depends on the adopted void-finding algorithm by comparing measurements across five distinct void definitions: spherical voids 'sparkling', watershed-based methods ('zobov' and 'revolver' in two modes), and free-form integrated-density voids ('popcorn'). We apply these complementary void-finding algorithms to the same galaxy sample drawn from the IllustrisTNG simulation (TNG300-1 at $z=0$) and compute individual galaxy bias profiles as a function of distance from void centers. We quantify the correlation between b\_i and the membership of the void catalogs and explore how this relationship varies with the integrated underdensity threshold for density-based methods. We find that the radial gradient of individual bias within voids, generally increasing from negative values at the void centers to higher values at the boundaries, is robust across most void definitions. However, density-threshold methods preferentially select galaxies with b\_i<0, while watershed methods without density constraints include substantial contamination from high-bias boundary galaxies. The correlation between negative bias and void membership is systematically strengthened as the integrated underdensity threshold becomes less restrictive, with popcorn achieving the highest purity in isolating anti-biased populations.

 We present a systematic study of the environments of 25 luminous quasars at $z > 6.5$ from the ASPIRE program. Using JWST/NIRCam WFSS data, we identified 487 galaxies at $5.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 7.0$ exhibiting [OIII] emission. Among these, 122 [OIII] emitters lie within $\|Δv\_{\rm los}\| < 1000~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ of the quasars, corresponding to a $\sim9.4$-fold enhancement relative to the average galaxy density at other redshifts. Furthermore, we identified 16 [CII]-emitting galaxies at the quasar redshifts from ALMA mosaic observations. A cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis between quasars and [OIII]+[CII] emitters yields a cross-correlation length of $r\_0^{\rm QG} = 8.68^{+0.51}\_{-0.55}~h^{-1}~\mathrm{cMpc}$ and a auto-correlation of $r\_0^{\rm{QQ}}=15.76^{+2.48}\_{-2.70}~h^{-1}~{\rm cMpc}$, indicating that $z \sim 7$ quasars reside in dark matter halos with $M\_{\rm halo} = 10^{12.27^{+0.21}\_{-0.26}}~M\_\odot$. Notably, the number of [OIII]-emitting galaxies at quasar redshifts varies significantly from field to field, ranging from zero to twenty, highlighting a diverse quasar environment. Remarkably, seven quasars trace significant galaxy overdensities (i.e., protoclusters), with $δ\_{\rm gal} > 5$ within a volume of $V \sim 500~{\rm cMpc^3}$. We also find that $\|Δv\_{\rm los}\|$ increases rapidly toward smaller galaxy-quasar separations in protocluster fields, consistent with galaxy kinematics around extremely massive halos in cosmological simulations. By combining JWST and ALMA data, we reveal the complex and diverse environments of these early quasars, providing robust evidence that the earliest luminous quasars are effective tracers of galaxy overdensities, albeit with substantial field-to-field variation.

2026-02-04, **The GMRT archive atomic gas survey -- III. Comparative Study of Dark Matter Halos in Nearby Galaxies**, Sougata Sarkar et.al., [2602.04959v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04959v1)

 The distribution of dark matter in the inner regions of galaxies poses a key challenge for small-scale ΛCDM cosmology. While cold dark matter simulations predict cuspy inner density profiles, observations of low surface brightness (LSB) and dwarf galaxies often favour cored profiles, an issue known as the cusp-core problem. We investigate this problem by comparing four dark matter halo profiles: NFW (cuspy), Einasto (intermediate), Burkert (cored), and pseudo-isothermal (pISO) (cored) in a pilot sample of $11$ galaxies from the GMRT archive atomic gas survey (GARCIA). We have performed mass modelling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, utilising rotation curves derived from robust 3D Kinematic modelling. Baryonic contributions from stars derived using stellar kinematics based on $3.6μ\mathrm{m}$ or $r$-band photometry via Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) combined with Jeans Anisotropic Model (JAM) and from gas, calculated directly from the gas surface density (HI + He) without assuming any predefined functional form, are included. Our mass modelling shows that all halo profiles provide statistically good fits, yielding consistent estimates of halo mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. To validate our analysis, we examine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and find broad agreement with empirical models. Non-parametric density profiles derived from baryon-subtracted rotation curves show that NFW fits the inner regions best, while all profiles converge in the outskirts. Future studies with a larger sample from GARCIA will be helpful in refining this trend and addressing the cusp-core issue in greater depth.

2026-02-04, **How Do Disk Galaxies Form?**, Vadim A. Semenov et.al., [2602.04950v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04950v1)

 In both observed and simulated galaxies, disk morphologies become more prevalent at higher masses and lower redshifts. To elucidate the physical origin of this trend, we develop a simple analytical model in which galaxy morphology is governed by the competition between rotational support and turbulence in a gravitational potential of a dark matter halo and the galaxy itself, and a disk forms when the potential steepens due to the accumulation of baryons in the halo center. The minimum galaxy mass required for this transition decreases with an increasing dark matter contribution within the galaxy, making more concentrated halos more prone to forming disks. Our model predicts that galaxy sizes behave qualitatively differently before and after disk formation: after disks form, sizes are governed by the halo spin, in agreement with classical models, whereas before disk formation, sizes are larger and set by the scale on which turbulent motions, which dominate over rotation, can be contained. We validate our model against the results of the TNG50 cosmological simulation and, despite the simplicity of the model, find remarkable agreement. In particular, our model explains the increase with redshift in the critical halo mass for disk formation, reported in both simulations and observations, as a consequence of the evolution of the halo mass-concentration and baryonic mass-halo mass relations. This redshift trend therefore supports the recent proposal that it is the steepening of the gravitational potential that causes disk formation, while other effects discussed in the literature, such as potential deepening and hot gaseous halo formation, can still play important roles in the transition from early turbulent to dynamically cold disks.

2026-02-04, **Oort Cloud Bombardment by Dark Matter**, Jeremy Mould et.al., [2602.04922v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04922v1)

 The realization that primordial black holes (PBHs) might be some fraction of the dark matter begged the question, how often do PBHs enter the solar system? For a Neptune radius solar system the answer is, rarely. For an Oort cloud sized system the answer is different. Simulations of bombardment of the Oort cloud by dark matter suggest that dislodgement of protocomets and their entry into the inner solar system can match the observed frequency of comets, if that PBH fraction is high enough. Comets were traditionally considered as messengers, usually omens. After 50 years of puzzlement regarding dark matter, we need a hint from the dark universe about the size and nature of dark matter particles.

2026-02-04, **Large-scale halo velocity correlations and the impact of finite simulation volumes**, Yao-Tsung Chuang et.al., [2602.04485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04485v1)

 The velocity correlation functions directly measured from the peculiar velocity field of dark matter in numerical simulations are known to have an amplitude lower than that predicted by theoretical models at large scales. The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k\_{\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)σ\_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k\_{\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $fσ\_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression. These results highlight the importance of accounting for missing long-wavelength modes when developing simulation-based modeling of velocity statistics, such as emulators.

2026-02-04, **Neutron Dark Decay and Exotic Compact Objects**, M. Vikiaris et.al., [2602.04477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04477v1)

 Recent measurements of the compact star XTE J1814-338, with a mass of $M=1.2\_{-0.05}^{+0.05}\ M\_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=7\_{-0.4}^{+0.4} \ {\rm Km}$ alongside those of HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77\_{-0.17}^{+0.20}\ M\_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=10.4\_{-0.78}^{+0.86} \ {\rm Km}$, provide compelling evidence for the potential existence of exotic matter in neutron star cores. These observations offer important insights into the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. Recently, Fornal and Grinstein, in order to overcame the discrepancy between the neutron lifetime measured in beam and bottle experiments, proposed the existence of neutron dark decay. In the present work, an effort is made to connect the interpretation of the above exotic compact objects with the possible existence of dark particles, assumed to be products of neutron dark decay. Our hypothesis offers an advantage over comparable proposals, as the coexistence of dark matter and hadronic matter within neutron stars emerges from an intrinsic mechanism, thereby obviating the need to invoke external merger-related processes. It is still unclear to what extent the proposed dark decay of the neutron is affected by the extreme environment within neutron stars. Within this framework, we examined the case in which a mechanism suppressing the dark neutron decay becomes operative at densities few times above nuclear saturation density. We found that the proposed alternative explanation accommodates the simultaneous existence of neutron dark decay while consistently predicting both the two solar mass limit and the presence of compact objects with subsolar masses.

2026-02-04, **Parametric Resonance and Backreaction Effects in Magnetogenesis from Ultralight Dark Matter**, Nirmalya Brahma et.al., [2602.04285v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04285v1)

 We take a more detailed look at the recently proposed magnetogenesis mechanism triggered by ultralight dark matter coupled to electromagnetism. The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects.

 We review late-time cosmic acceleration after DESI Data Release~2 (DR2), emphasizing the interplay between Type~Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), anisotropic BAO, CMB calibration, and perturbation-sensitive probes (RSD and weak lensing). DESI DR2 delivers percent-level BAO distance ratios over $0\lesssim z\lesssim2.5$, including a Ly$α$-forest anchor at $z\_{\rm eff}=2.33$. In CMB-calibrated combinations, flat $Λ$CDM exhibits a mild parameter mismatch, while allowing evolving dark energy (e.g.\ CPL $w\_0$--$w\_a$) can improve the fit; the preference is dataset-dependent and is particularly sensitive to redshift-dependent SN calibration/selection residuals at the few$\times10^{-2}$\,mag level. To sharpen likelihood-level interpretation, we provide two diagnostics: (i) an $r\_d$-independent BAO-shape observable, $F\_{\rm AP}(z)\equiv D\_{\rm M}(z)/D\_{\rm H}(z)$, constructed directly from published $(D\_{\rm M}/r\_d,\,D\_{\rm H}/r\_d)$ with covariance propagation; and (ii) a linear-response map from SN Hubble-diagram systematics $δμ(z)$ to induced biases in $(w\_0,w\_a)$, yielding an explicit calibration requirement for DESI-era claims of evolving $w(z)$. We synthesize parametric and non-parametric reconstructions of $w(z)$ and $ρ\_{\rm DE}(z)$ and map the resulting phenomenology to microphysical dark-energy and modified-gravity models subject to perturbation stability and gravitational-wave propagation constraints.

 The nuclear $γ$-ray lines in the MeV range of the electromagnetic spectrum hold a vast variety of astrophysical, particle-physical, and fundamental physical information that is otherwise extreme difficult to access. MeV $γ$-ray line observations provide the most direct evidence for ongoing nucleosynthesis in galaxies by measuring freshly produced radioactive isotopes from massive stars, supernovae, classical novae, or binary neutron star mergers. Their flux ratios can determine the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum in different objects and of the Milky Way as a whole. Different phases of the interstellar medium are traced by hot nucleosynthesis ejecta, cooling positrons, or cosmic-ray interactions with molecular clouds. Positron annihilation itself can be considered as an astrophysical messenger as their production and destruction in typical space environments is inevitable. Finally, as-of-yet unknown signatures from beyond standard model physics might have their elusive imprints in $γ$-ray lines. This Chapter gives an overview of historical $γ$-ray line measurements, newest results, and open questions that may only be solved by a new generation of MeV telescopes.

2026-02-04, **The Hubble Tension in Light of the Symmetry of Scale Invariance**, Frederic Courbin et.al., [2602.04532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04532v1)

 When the expansion rate of the Universe at recombination is used to infer the present expansion rate $H\_0$, the value derived in the $Λ$CDM model, $H\_0=67.4$ km/s/mpc, is about in 6$\, σ$ tension with the value measured locally, $H\_0=74$ km/s/mpc. In this work, we consider instead the expansion history in the context of the symmetry of scale-invariant vacuum (SIV model). We first perform two major cosmological tests: the Hubble diagram for type-Ia supernovae and the fundamental relation between $H\_0$, the age of the Universe, and the total density of matter, $Ω\_m$. This allows us to constrain $Ω\_m$ in SIV, with both tests giving the best agreement for $Ω\_m \simeq 0.20$. We then study the physical connections of the dynamical and thermal states of the Universe at recombination with the present Hubble constant, $H\_0$, and the present temperature, $T$, in the $Λ$CDM and SIV contexts. We find that, in SIV, the properties at recombination may be conveyed to the present ones ($T=2.726$ and $H\_0$ at $z=0$) without any tension, indicating $H\_0=74$ km/s/mpc in spite of the anchoring on the CMB. This is due to the slightly different expansion and temperature histories of the two cosmological models. Importantly, this happens to occur for $Ω\_m \simeq 0.20$, as constrained in SIV with supernovae and cosmic age. This suggests that the Hubble tension currently found between $H\_0$ values in the early and late Universe may simply be the result of $ΛCDM$ ignoring the small but still measurable effects of scale invariance.

2026-02-04, **SN 2017ati: A luminous type IIb explosion from a massive progenitor**, Z. -H. Peng et.al., [2602.04474v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04474v1)

 We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type~IIb supernova (SN)~2017ati. It reached the maximum light at about 27~d after the explosion and the light curve shows a broad, luminous peak with an absolute $r$-band magnitude of $M\_{r} = -18.48 \pm 0.16$~mag. At about 50~d after maximum light, SN~2017ati exhibits a decline rate close to that expected from the $^{56}$Co $\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe radioactive decay, at 0.98 mag per 100 days, as usually observed in SNe IIb. However, it remains systematically brighter at late times by about 1--2~mag, exceeding the usual upper luminosity range of this class. As a result, modelling the light curve of SN~2017ati with a standard $^{56}$Ni decay scenario requires a large nickel mass of up to $\sim0.37\,M\_{\odot}$ and still fails to reproduce the early-time light curve adequately. In contrast, incorporating additional energy input from a magnetar yields a significantly improved fit to the light curve of SN~2017ati, which would reduce the nickel mass to $\sim0.21\,M\_{\odot}$, still close to the upper end of the range typically inferred for SNe~IIb. Comparing the fitted results of SN~2017ati with the known sample of SNe~IIb indicates that its luminosity evolution is best explained by a combination of neutron star spin-down energy and radioactive nickel deposition. From late-time nebular spectra of SN~2017ati, the luminosity of the [\Oi]~$λ\lambda6300,6364$ doublet implies an oxygen mass of $\sim1.82-3.34\,M\_{\odot}$, and the combination of a [\Caii]/[\Oi] flux ratio of $\sim0.5$ with nebular spectral model comparisons favours a progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass of $\geq17\,M\_{\odot}$.

2026-02-04, **From Main Sequence Binary to Blast: MESA Modeling of the Double-Detonation Progenitor PTF1~J2238+7430**, Mercedes S. Hernandez et.al., [2602.04421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04421v1)

 Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars in close binaries with white dwarf (WD) companions are potential progenitors of double-detonation thermonuclear supernovae. The recently discovered system PTF1 J2238+7430 is a candidate for this evolutionary channel, hosting a low-mass sdB and a comparatively massive WD in a compact orbit. We aim to reproduce the evolutionary history of PTF1 J2238+7430, in which the sdB forms first via stable mass transfer, followed by the formation of the WD through a subsequent common-envelope (CE) phase. Additionally, we seek to constrain the range of initial binary parameters that can lead to such double-detonation progenitors. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we performed detailed binary evolution simulations from the zero-age main sequence to the present-day configuration. We explored initial stellar masses, orbital periods, and mass-loss fractions, including the effects of angular momentum transfer, tidal synchronization, and gravitational-wave-driven orbital evolution. The post-CE binary properties were derived using the standard energy formalism. Our models successfully reproduce the observed properties of PTF1 J2238+7430, consisting of a 0.406 solar-mass sdB and a 0.72 solar-mass WD in a 76.34-minute orbit. Stable Roche-lobe overflow of an approximately 2.7 solar-mass donor produces the sdB, while the WD forms from the initially less massive companion during an episode of CE evolution. We find that the CE ejection efficiency must be high to match the observed orbit, exceeding canonical values for similar systems. We further delineate the allowed parameter space for initial binaries that can evolve into sdB+WD systems consistent with double-detonation progenitors. These limits are preliminary; a systematic exploration of all parameters is needed for robust constraints, but our results provide a useful starting point for future work.

2026-02-04, **Stellar Interpretation of Meteoritic Data and PLotting for Everyone (SIMPLE): Isotope Mixing Lines for Six Sets of Core-Collapse Supernova Models**, Marco Pignatari et.al., [2602.04354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04354v1)

 Bulk meteorites and their inclusions exhibit, for many chemical elements, isotopic variability produced by nucleosynthetic events in stars and supernovae before the formation of the Sun. While the exact astrophysical origins of these variations are still a matter of debate, their identification provides insights on the environment of the Sun's birth and the formation of the Solar System. Here we present a new Python tool called SIMPLE (Stellar Interpretation of Meteoritic Data and Plotting for Everyone) designed to compare the isotopic composition of the ejecta from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with meteoritic data. In the present version, the SIMPLE toolkit includes a dataset of 18 CCSN models, from 6 different published sets, with initial masses of 15, 20, and 25 M$\_{\odot}$ and solar metallicity. SIMPLE is designed to easily extract the isotopic abundances predicted by each CCSN model for any elements and post-process them into the format needed to compare to the meteoritic data, therefore, facilitating their interpretation. As an example of how to use SIMPLE, we analyze the composition of the Ni isotopes in the 18 models and confirm that bulk meteorite Ni anomalies are compatible with material from the innermost Si-rich region of CCSN ejecta. Designed as a collaborative platform, SIMPLE is open-source and welcomes community contributions to enhance its development and dissemination for stellar nucleosynthesis and meteoritic studies. Future enhancements include addition of more model predictions and inclusion of mixing between different layers of supernova ejecta.

 Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) exhibit a significant diversity in their explosion properties, yet the physical mechanisms driving this diversity remain unknown. In this work, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024abfl, a SN IIP in NGC 2146 with a directly detected red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. We find it has a low plateau luminosity ($M\_V \sim -15$ mag) and a relatively long plateau length ($\sim 126.5$ days). By fitting a semi-analytical model, we estimated a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim 0.009 M\_\odot$, an initial kinetic energy of $\sim 0.42$ foe, an initial thermal energy of $\sim 0.03$ foe and an ejecta mass of $\sim 8.3 M\_\odot$. The spectral evolution of SN 2024abfl is similar to those of other SNe IIP, except for much lower ejecta velocities at similar epochs. At later epochs, we find a relatively high-velocity H$α$ absorption feature at $\sim -4000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly due to a fast-moving plume of matter in the inner ejecta, and two emission features at $\pm 2000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly caused by CSM interaction. We estimate the progenitor mass to be $\le 15 M\_\odot$ based on nebular spectra. We conclude that SN 2024abfl is a low-luminosity SN IIP originating from a low-mass RSG progenitor.
