2025-06-25, **SuperSONIC: Cloud-Native Infrastructure for ML Inferencing**, Dmitry Kondratyev et.al., [2506.20657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20657v1)

 The increasing computational demand from growing data rates and complex machine learning (ML) algorithms in large-scale scientific experiments has driven the adoption of the Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors (SONIC) approach. SONIC accelerates ML inference by offloading it to local or remote coprocessors to optimize resource utilization. Leveraging its portability to different types of coprocessors, SONIC enhances data processing and model deployment efficiency for cutting-edge research in high energy physics (HEP) and multi-messenger astrophysics (MMA). We developed the SuperSONIC project, a scalable server infrastructure for SONIC, enabling the deployment of computationally intensive tasks to Kubernetes clusters equipped with graphics processing units (GPUs). Using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, SuperSONIC decouples client workflows from server infrastructure, standardizing communication, optimizing throughput, load balancing, and monitoring. SuperSONIC has been successfully deployed for the CMS and ATLAS experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (IceCube), and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and tested on Kubernetes clusters at Purdue University, the National Research Platform (NRP), and the University of Chicago. SuperSONIC addresses the challenges of the Cloud-native era by providing a reusable, configurable framework that enhances the efficiency of accelerator-based inference deployment across diverse scientific domains and industries.

2025-06-25, **Excitation of the non-resonant streaming instability around sources of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays**, Alessandro Cermenati et.al., [2506.20646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20646v1)

 The interpretation of the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray spectrum (UHECRs) and composition suggests a suppression of the flux below $\sim$1 EeV, as observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array. A natural explanation for this phenomenon involves magnetic confinement effects. We investigate the possibility that UHECRs self-generate the magnetic turbulence necessary for such confinement via current-driven plasma instabilities. Specifically, we show that the electric current produced by escaping UHECRs can excite a non-resonant streaming instability in the surrounding plasma. This instability reduces the diffusion coefficient in the source environment, effectively trapping particles with energies $E \lesssim 0.6$ EeV $\mathcal{L}\_{45}^{1/2} R\_{\text{Mpc}}^{-1} \lambda\_{10}^{2}$ for times exceeding the age of the Universe. Here, $\mathcal{L}\_{45}$ is the source luminosity in units of $10^{45}$ erg/s, $R\_{\text{Mpc}}$ is the radial size in Mpc, and $\lambda\_{10}$ is the intergalactic magnetic field coherence length in units of 10 Mpc. We discuss in detail the conditions, in terms of source luminosity, initial magnetic field, and the environment in which this phenomenon occurs, that need to be fulfilled in order for self-confinement to take place near a source of UHECRs. By modeling a population of UHECR sources with a luminosity function typical of extragalactic gamma-ray sources, we connect the spectrum of escaping particles to the luminosity distribution. Furthermore, we calculate the contribution of these confined particles to cosmogenic neutrino production, finding consistency with current observational constraints. Our results suggest that self-induced turbulence may play an important role in shaping the UHECR spectrum and, in particular, may account for the flux suppression near their sources, offering a promising framework for interpreting current observations.

2025-06-25, **Analytic formulation of Leptogenesis with neutrino oscillation data employing the general parametrization for neutrino mass matrix**, Nobuchika Okada et.al., [2506.20580v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20580v1)

 The observed neutrino oscillations and baryon asymmetry, unexplained by the Standard Model (SM), can both be accounted for by extending the SM to include Majorana right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). Tiny neutrino masses naturally arise through the Type-I seesaw mechanism, which involves lepton number violation. Meanwhile, the baryon asymmetry can be generated via leptogenesis, where the out-of-equilibrium decay of RHNs produces a lepton asymmetry that is partially converted into a baryon asymmetry through sphaleron processes. The Dirac Yukawa couplings play the crucial role for both Type-I seesaw and leptogenesis. In this work, we derive an analytic expression for the CP asymmetry parameter in a general parametrization. Focusing on a hierarchical RHN mass spectrum, we evaluate the lowest mass of the lightest RHN that reproduce both neutrino oscillation data and the observed baryon asymmetry. We study the case with two and three generations of RHNs for both thermal and non-thermal leptogenesis scenarios. Besides the standard Type-I seesaw involving SM Higgs doublet, we also examine the Type-I seesaw with a new neutrinophillic Higgs doublet. In this case for non-thermal leptogenesis, the minimum value for the lightest RHN mass can be as low as sphaleron decoupling temperature.

2025-06-25, **Operation of the Trigger System for the ICARUS Detector at Fermilab**, ICARUS collaboration et.al., [2506.20137v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20137v1)

 The ICARUS liquid argon TPC detector is taking data on the Booster (BNB) and Main Injector (NuMI) Neutrino beam lines at Fermilab with a trigger system based on the scintillation light produced by charged particles in coincidence with the proton beam extraction from the accelerators. The architecture and the deployment of the trigger system in the first two runs for physics are presented, as well as the triggered event rates. The event recognition efficiency has been evaluated as a function of the deposited energy and the position of cosmic muons stopping inside the detector.

2025-06-24, **A Radio-quiet AGN as a candidate counterpart to neutrino event IceCube-200615A**, F. McBride et.al., [2506.20064v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20064v1)

 Follow-up observations of neutrino events have been a promising method for identifying sources of very-high-energy cosmic rays. Neutrinos are unambiguous tracers of hadronic interactions and cosmic rays. On June 15, 2020, IceCube detected a neutrino event with an 82.8% probability of being astrophysical in origin. To identify the astrophysical source of the neutrino, we used X-ray tiling observations to identify potential counterpart sources. We performed additional multiwavelength follow-up with NuSTAR and the VLA in order to construct a broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the most likely counterpart. From the SED, we calculate an estimate for the neutrinos we expect to detect from the source. While the source does not have a high predicted neutrino flux, it is still a plausible neutrino emitter. It is important to note that the other bright X-ray candidate sources consistent with the neutrino event are also radio-quiet AGN. A statistical analysis shows that 1RXS J093117.6+033146 is the most likely counterpart (87.5%) if the neutrino is cosmic in origin and if it is among X-ray detectable sources. This results adds to previous results suggesting a connection between radio-quiet AGN and IceCube neutrino events.

2025-06-24, **Road through Dark$ν$ess: Probing dark matter-neutrino interactions using KM3-230213A**, Ranjini Mondol et.al., [2506.19910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19910v1)

 KM3NeT has recently reported an event where a muon of energy $120^{+110}\_{-60}$ PeV was observed at its ARCA detector, which can stem from a very high-energy neutrino interaction in the vicinity of the detector. Besides revolutionizing our understanding of high-energy neutrino sources, this event can serve as a valuable probe for studying Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) interactions of neutrinos. In this work, we study the dark matter (DM)-neutrino interaction by assuming the neutrino for the event KM3-230213A is originated from a blazar. The flux of such neutrinos, traveling through DM distributed across astrophysical and cosmological scales, can get attenuated due to DM interactions. The detection of such event by KM3NeT allows us to place constraints on the interaction cross section at highest-ever neutrino energy. We derive both conservative constraints-neglecting flux attenuation from the host halo-and optimistic ones by including host halo contributions. Our results show that the energy-independent constraints are weaker than previous bounds. For energy-dependent case, the extreme energy of the event allows us to set some of the strongest limits on scattering cross sections. In future, more such neutrino events with well-understood origin will be essential in constraining or potentially discovering DM-neutrino interactions.

2025-06-24, **Non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry and odd weight polyharmonic Maaß form**, Bu-Yao Qu et.al., [2506.19822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19822v1)

 We extend the framework of non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry to include the odd weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms. The integer weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms of level $N$ can be arranged into multipltets of the homogeneous finite modular group $\Gamma'\_N$. We propose to construct the integer weight, including weight one, non-holomorphic polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms from the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. The previous results of even weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms are reproduced. We apply this formalism to address the flavor structure of the standard model. An example lepton model based on the modular group $\Gamma'\_3\cong T'$ is constructed, where neutrino masses are generated via type-I seesaw mechanism with two right-handed neutrinos. This model can accommodate the experimental data for both normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings. We further extend this model to include quarks, so that the masses and mixing parameters of both quark and lepton sectors can be successfully described in terms of only thirteen real free parameters. It is the modular invariant model with the smallest number of free parameters so far, only normal ordering neutrino mass is viable after including quarks, and the correlations among the input parameters and flavor observables are analyzed.

2025-06-24, **Assessing the accuracy of the GENIE event generator with electron scattering data: Reduced cross section and nuclear transparency**, A. V. Butkevich et.al., [2506.19355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19355v1)

 The reduced cross sections of the semi-exclusive $(l,l'p)$ lepton scattering process can be identified with distorted nuclear spectral functions. Irrespective of the type of interaction the distorted spectral function is determined mainly by intrinsic properties of the target and the ejected nucleon interaction with residual nucleus. Thus the reduced cross sections of the neutrino and electron scattering on nuclei as functions of nucleon missing momentum and energy are similar up to Coulomb corrections. Here we demonstrate the utility of this approach by benchmarking the GENIE neutrino event generator against a broad set of semi-exclusive electron scattering data for carbon target. We observe persistent disagreements between the generator predictions and data in the range of nucleon missing momenta less than 80 MeV/c. The approach presented in this paper provide a great opportunity to test better the accuracy of nuclear models of quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, employed in neutrino event generators.

2025-06-24, **Torsional modulation of atmospheric neutrino oscillation**, Riya Barick et.al., [2506.19354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19354v1)

 Fermions act as sources of spacetime torsion. However, this torsion is non-dynamical and can be eliminated using its equations of motion. The resulting theory features an effective four-fermion interaction in a torsion-free background. Generically this interaction is non-universal and violates parity. When neutrinos propagate through matter, they experience the effect of this geometrical interaction, which is similar to the MSW effect, but diagonal in the mass basis. Since this quartic interaction term varies linearly with matter density, its effect will be more prominent for atmospheric neutrinos specially for upward going atmospheric neutrinos. We investigate the effect of spacetime geometry on $\nu\_\mu \to \nu\_\tau$ and $\nu\_\mu \to \nu\_e$ conversion probability and $\nu\_\mu$ survival probability, by solving the Schr\"odinger equation using the PREM density profile of the Earth. We also study the dependence of atmospheric neutrino oscillation probability on the CP phase angle in presence of this effect. We further provide a discussion of the MSW and parametric resonances in presence of the geometrical interaction.

2025-06-24, **Measurement of the mean number of muons with energies above 500 GeV in air showers detected with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2506.19241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19241v1)

 We present a measurement of the mean number of muons with energies larger than 500 GeV in near-vertical extensive air showers initiated by cosmic rays with primary energies between 2.5 PeV and 100 PeV. The measurement is based on events detected in coincidence between the surface and in-ice detectors of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Air showers are recorded on the surface by IceTop, while a bundle of high-energy muons ("TeV muons") from the shower can subsequently produce a track-like event in the IceCube in-ice array. Results are obtained assuming the hadronic interaction models Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC. The measured number of TeV muons is found to be in agreement with predictions from air-shower simulations. The results have also been compared to a measurement of low-energy muons by IceTop, indicating an inconsistency between the predictions for low- and high-energy muons in simulations based on the EPOS-LHC model.

2025-06-25, **Cosmological bounds on dark matter annihilation using dark ages 21-cm signal**, Vivekanand Mohapatra et.al., [2506.20648v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20648v1)

 We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on the global 21-cm signal during the dark ages and cosmic dawn eras. The 21-cm line provides a complementary probe for studying the nature of dark matter beyond standard cosmological observables. In the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the expected absorption amplitude of the dark ages global 21-cm signal is approximately $-42\, \rm mK$. However, energy injection from DM annihilation can significantly heat and ionize the intergalactic medium, potentially altering or even erasing this absorption feature. We evaluate the thermal and ionization history of the gas to derive an upper bound on $f\_\chi^2 \langle \sigma v \rangle / M\_\chi$ using the dark ages signal, which is free from astrophysical uncertainties. After incorporating observational and theoretical uncertainties arising from future lunar-based experiments and variations in cosmological parameters, respectively -- we obtain a conservative upper limit of $f\_\chi^2\langle\sigma v\rangle/M\_\chi \lesssim 10^{-28}~\rm cm^3\,s^{-1}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. This constraint is nearly an order of magnitude stronger than the bounds derived from Planck 2018 data.

2025-06-25, **Cosmological abundance of primordial black holes in mixed dark matter scenarios incorporating Kaluza-Klein dark matter**, Yupeng Yang et.al., [2506.20391v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20391v1)

 The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m\_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M\_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M\_{\odot}$, are $f\_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.

2025-06-25, **Mono-Higgs signature in a singlet fermionic dark matter model**, Yeong Gyun Kim et.al., [2506.20113v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20113v1)

 We investigate the production of dark matter in association with a Higgs boson at the LHC within the singlet fermionic dark matter model. We focus on final states featuring a Higgs boson accompanied by large missing transverse momentum ($E^{\textrm{miss}}\_{\textrm{T}}$), where the Higgs decays into a $b \bar{b}$ pair in the ATLAS analysis and into a $ZZ$ pair in the CMS analysis. Assuming light dark matter fermions with a mass of approximately 1 GeV, we find that the predicted production yields in this model are compatible with, or even exceed, those of the benchmark scenarios studied in the recent experimental analyses, particularly in the low $E^{\textrm{miss}}\_{\textrm{T}}$ region, under parameter sets allowed by current collider bounds and dark matter constraints. Therefore, we expect that some exclusion limits on the model parameters introduced in this work may be derived from existing ATLAS and CMS mono-Higgs search results, and that the mono-Higgs production in this model can be directly probed at the future High-Luminosity phase of the LHC.

2025-06-25, **Constraints on the dark sector from electroweak precision observables**, B. M. Loizos et.al., [2506.20080v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20080v1)

 We revisit the Standard Model fit to electroweak precision observables in using the latest data and the Particle Data Group (PDG) measurement of the W boson mass. The analysis is then repeated in light of the new W boson mass measurement from the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) collaboration. We then introduce a dark photon to the model, placing constraints on the parameter space arising from these electroweak precision observables, both for the PDG and CDF values for the W boson mass. We also extend previous work by placing the first electroweak precision observable constraints on the coupling of dark photons to the fermionic dark matter sector.

2025-06-25, **WIMP/FIMP dark matter and primordial black holes with memory burden effect**, Amane Takeshita et.al., [2506.20071v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20071v1)

 The lifetime of primordial black holes (PBHs), which were formed in the early universe, can be extended by the memory burden effect. Light PBHs may be in existence today and become a candidate for dark matter (DM). We assume that DM is made of thermally produced weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), WIMPs produced via Hawking radiation of PBHs, and survived PBHs via the memory burden effect. In addition, feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) are considered as an alternative to WIMPs. Various similar studies have been conducted either with or without considering the memory burden effect. In this study, we simultaneously account for thermally produced WIMPs or FIMPs and the memory burden effect of PBHs to explain the relic abundance of DM. We show that this abundance is highly sensitive to the memory burden effect in PBHs.

2025-06-24, **New bounds on Axion-Like Particles in the Ultraviolet from Legacy Data**, Elisa Todarello et.al., [2506.19962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19962v1)

 We use legacy data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) to search for a spectral line from the spontaneous decay of axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter. The HST data consists of blank sky observations taken with the Faint Object Spectrograph in the 165-240~nm wavelength range, while the IUE data consists of observations of the Virgo Cluster obtained with the long- and short-wavelength spectrographs, covering 195-325~nm and 123-200~nm, respectively. We set a 95\% C.L. upper limit on the ALP-photon coupling $g\_{a\gamma} < 10^{-11}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across the full ALP mass range. Notably, we rule out values of $g\_{a\gamma}$ above $1.6 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses between 12.4 and 14.5\,eV, improving upon previous limits by an order of magnitude.

2025-06-24, **QCD Axion Domain Walls from Super-Cooling First Order Phase Transition**, Kun-Feng Lyu et.al., [2506.19918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19918v1)

 The QCD axion is a well-motivated hypothetical particle beyond the Standard Model (SM) and a compelling dark matter candidate. Its relic abundance is highly sensitive to the thermal history of the universe when the temperature is around the QCD confinement scale. Meanwhile, the NANOGrav Collaboration has reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background, which could originate from a supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) with a nucleation temperature around the O(MeV-GeV) scale. We explore how such an FOPT might alter the evolution of the QCD axion. Our findings suggest that it could induce the axion to go through a short stage of mini kinetic misalignment. Moreover, in some parameter regime, the formation of QCD axion domain walls becomes generically expected. This has intriguing implications for both the existence of the QCD axion and the FOPT interpretation of the NANOGrav signal.

2025-06-24, **Long-lived SEC violation via DM/DE couplings**, Gary Shiu et.al., [2506.19914v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19914v1)

 We discuss a cosmological scenario where an effective violation of the strong energy condition (SEC) is realized through a coupling between SEC-fulfilling dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). Although the SEC-violating solutions might in principle last for an arbitrarily long time, we highlight several challenges that string realizations must face: most notably, the identification of suitable heavy states and their relationship with the theory cutoff. We also discuss negative potentials in the presence of a tower of light states, showing that the DM/DE coupling can push the theory towards regions of parametric control.

2025-06-24, **First High-Throughput Evaluation of Dark Matter Detector Materials**, Sinéad M. Griffin et.al., [2506.19905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19905v1)

 We perform the first high-throughput search and evaluation of materials that can serve as excellent low-mass dark matter detectors. Using properties of close to one thousand materials from the Materials Project database, we project the sensitivity in dark matter parameter space for experiments constructed from each material, including both absorption and scattering processes between dark matter and electrons. Using the anisotropic materials in the dataset, we further compute the level of daily modulation in interaction rates and the resulting directional sensitivities, highlighting materials with prospects to detect the dark matter wind. Our methods provide the basic tools for the data-driven design of dark matter detectors, and our findings lay the groundwork for the next generation of highly optimized direct searches for dark matter as light as the keV scale.

2025-06-24, **MUSE-DARK-I: Dark matter halo properties of intermediate-z star-forming galaxies**, B. I. Ciocan et.al., [2506.19721v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19721v1)

 [Abridged] We analyse the dark matter (DM) halo properties of 127 0.3<z<1.5 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) down to low stellar masses (7<log(Mstar/Msun)<11), using data from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey and photometry from HST and JWST. We employ a 3D forward modelling approach to analyse the morpho-kinematics of our sample, enabling measurement of individual rotation curves out to 2-3 times the effective radius. We perform a disk-halo decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as or better than the other profiles in >65% of the sample. We find that the kinematically inferred stellar masses agree with values from SED fitting. We find that 89% of galaxies have DM fractions >50%. For 70% of SFGs, we infer a DM inner slope, gamma < 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation is found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar, while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z systems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale radii are z-invariant.

2025-06-24, **Cross-sections and experimental signatures for detection of a well-defined dark matter WIMP**, Bailey Tallman et.al., [2506.19719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19719v1)

 We report the following calculations for a recently proposed bosonic dark matter WIMP with well-defined interactions: (1)~the mass as determined by fitting to the relic abundance; (2)~the current annihilation cross-section for indirect detection; (3)~cross-sections for pair production accompanied by jets in proton colliders with center-of-mass energies ranging from 13 to 100 TeV; (4)~for the high-luminosity LHC, and planned 100 TeV proton collider, detailed plots of experimentally accessible quantities before and after optimal cuts; (5)~cross-sections, and plots of experimentally accessible quantities, for production in e$^+$e$^-$ or muon colliders with center-of-mass energies up to 10 TeV; (6)~cross-section per nucleon for direct detection. The conclusions are given in the text, including the principal prediction that (with optimal cuts) this particle should be detectable at the high-luminosity LHC, perhaps after only two years with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$.

2025-06-24, **Directional search for light dark matter with quantum sensors**, Hajime Fukuda et.al., [2506.19614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19614v1)

 The presence of dark matter (DM) stands as one of the most compelling indications of new physics in particle physics. Typically, the detection of wave-like DM involves quantum sensors, such as qubits or cavities. The phase of the sensors is usually discarded as the value of the phase itself is not physically meaningful. However, the difference of the phase between the sensors contains the information of the velocity and direction of the DM wind. We propose a measurement protocol to extract this information from the sensors using quantum states. Our method does not require specific experimental setups and can be applied to any type of DM detector as long as the data from the detectors can be taken quantum mechanically. We also show that our method does not spoil the sensitivity of the DM detectors and is superior to the classical method based on the correlations of the DM signals between the detectors.

2025-06-24, **Tracing Cosmic Voids with fast simulations**, M. D. Lepinzan et.al., [2506.19506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19506v1)

 Context. Cosmic voids are vast underdense regions in the cosmic web that encode crucial information about structure formation, the composition of the Universe, and its expansion history. Due to their lower density, these regions are less affected by non-linear gravitational dynamics, making them suitable candidates for analysis using semi-analytic methods. Aims. We assess the accuracy of the PINOCCHIO code, a fast tool for generating dark matter halo catalogs based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, in modeling the statistical properties of cosmic voids. We validate this approach by comparing the resulting void statistics measured from PINOCCHIO to those obtained from N-body simulations. Methods. We generate a set of simulations using PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, assuming a fiducial cosmology and varying the resolution. For a given resolution, the simulations share the same initial conditions between the different simulation codes. Snapshots are saved at multiple redshifts for each simulation and post-processed using the watershed void finder VIDE to identify cosmic voids. For each simulation code, we measure the following statistics: void size function, void ellipticity function, core density function, and the void radial density profile. We use these statistics to quantify the accuracy of PINOCCHIO relative to OpenGADGET3 in the context of cosmic voids. Results. We find agreement for all void statistics at better than 2{\sigma} between PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, with no systematic difference in redshift trends. This demonstrates that the PINOCCHIO code can reliably produce void statistics with high computational efficiency compared to full N-body simulations.

2025-06-24, **Detectability of dark matter density distribution via gravitational waves from binary black holes in the Galactic center**, Zhijin Li et.al., [2506.19327v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19327v1)

 The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.

2025-06-25, **Outflows from Star-Forming Galaxies in the Early Universe: Evolution from Double- to Single-Peaked Lyman-$ α$ Profiles Following Delayed Supernova Feedback**, James Nianias et.al., [2506.20422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20422v1)

 Lyman-$ \alpha $ emission, which owing to its resonant nature strongly couples the emergent line profile to gas kinematics, has become a key observable for probing outflows from star-forming galaxies in the early universe. Typically, Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles are explained in terms of idealised expanding shell models, while empirically-motivated interpretations of Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles that make use of comparisons with kinematics revealed by other spectral features (e.g. metal emission and absorption lines) are limited. Here, we analyse the kinematics of emission/absorption lines in the spectra of 338 gravitationally-lensed Lyman-$ \alpha $ sources revealed via blind spectroscopy of galaxy clusters with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Using metal emission lines to measure systemic redshifts, we confirm that the Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles are consistent with outflowing gas. In cases where interstellar metal absorption lines are detected, we find their kinematics and line ratios to be indicative of clumpy outflows. We investigate the differences between sources with single- and double-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles, finding the latter to drive weaker outflows yet show spectral signatures suggestive of younger stellar ages ($ < 4\,$Myr compared with $ > 20\,$Myr for sources with single-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles). We argue that double-peaked Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles may reflect weaker feedback in extremely young starbursts due to the delayed onset of supernova explosions. We also investigate whether outflow properties can be reliably inferred by fitting simple expanding shell models. We find that these models yield unphysical parameters in many cases even when they can reproduce the Lyman-$ \alpha $ profiles to high precision, and urge caution when inferring outflow properties from such models.

2025-06-25, **Framework for phase transitions between the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions at finite temperature**, Constantinos Constantinou et.al., [2506.20418v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20418v1)

 The characteristics of the hadron-to-quark first-order phase transition differ depending on whether charge neutrality is locally or globally fulfilled. In $\beta$-equilibrated matter, these two possibilities correspond to the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions. Recently, we presented a new framework in which a continuously-varying parameter allows one to describe a first-order phase transition in intermediate scenarios to the two extremes of fully local and fully global charge neutrality. In this work, we extend the previous framework to finite temperatures and out-of-$\beta$ equilibrium conditions, making it available for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. We investigate its impact on key thermodynamic quantities across a range of baryon densities, temperatures, and electron fractions. We find that when matter is not in $\beta$-equilibrium, the pressure in the mixed phase is not constant even for the case of fully-local charge neutrality. Moreover, we compute the thermal index using three different approaches, demonstrating that the finite-temperature extension of an equation of state using a constant thermal index can be ill-defined when applied to the mixed phase.

2025-06-25, **Fine-Tuned Supernova or Failed Explosion? Decoding the Origins of the G3425 Binary**, Zsolt Regaly et.al., [2506.20386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20386v1)

 A binary system (G3425) consisting of a massive unseen component and a red giant star on a nearly circular orbit was recently discovered. The formation of such a system is puzzling because orbital stability generally breaks down due to the large mass loss from the system caused by the SN explosion while forming the unseen component. Analytical solutions of the variable-mass two-body problem suggest that the explosion should have occurred when the component was close to its apocenter to explain the near-circular remnant system. This provides a strong constraint on the total mass and orbital configuration of the progenitor system. The nearly circular orbit of G3425 rules out type II SN scenarios and allows only for a fine-tuned SN~Ib/c explosion to occur when the secondary was close to its apocenter. Such a scenario, although possible, is highly unlikely. However, the most likely scenario is a failed SN that produced a black hole, for which no additional constraints on the position of the secondary are needed. We propose that the unseen component of G3425 is a mass-gap black hole with a mass constrained between the theoretical minimum for failed supernova progenitors (4 MSun) and the observed upper limit (4.4 MSun). Our analysis can be applied to any wide binary system containing an unseen component on a nearly circular orbit.

 The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), as a pathfinder of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, is the first lobster-eye focusing X-ray telescope with a considerably large field-of-view (FoV) ever flown. During the two and half years of operations, a series of calibration observations were performed, to fully characterize its performance and calibrate the instrumental properties. In this paper, we present the results of the in-flight calibration campaign of LEIA, focusing on the properties of the PSF, source positional accuracy, effective area, energy response and the instrumental background. The calibration sources used are the Crab nebula, Sco X-1 and Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Specifically, it is found that the spatial resolution remains almost unchanged compared to the pre-launch values, ranging from 3.6'-9.3' with a median of 5.9'. The post-calibration source positional accuracy is found to be ~2' (at the 90% C.L.). The Crab spectra can be well reproduced by the absorbed power-law model with the best-fit parameters in large agreement with the literature values, indicating that the in-orbit effective area is overall consistent with the model predictions and ground measurements. The effective area exhibits a systematic of $\lesssim10\%$ (at the 68% C.L.), and a mild deterioration of ~15% at the lower energy end after one year of operation. The Cas A spectral analysis shows that the energy scale and spectral resolution of the detectors are generally consistent with ground values. The instrumental background is found to be largely consistent among the four detectors, with strong modulations by the geomagnetic activity and the spectrum qualitatively consistent with our previous simulations. These instrumental performances well meet the design requirements. This work paves the way for the in-orbit calibration of the EP-WXT.

2025-06-25, **Microquasar jet-cocoon systems as PeVatrons**, B. Theodore Zhang et.al., [2506.20193v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20193v1)

 The origin of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), particularly around the knee region ($\sim$3 PeV), remains a major unsolved question. Recent observations by LHAAASO suggest that the knee is shaped mainly by protons, with a transition to heavier elements at higher energies. Microquasars -- compact jet-emitting sources -- have emerged as possible PeV CR accelerators, especially after detections of ultrahigh-energy gamma rays from these systems. We propose that the observed proton spectrum (hard below a few PeV, steep beyond) arises from the reacceleration of sub-TeV Galactic CRs via shear acceleration in large-scale microquasar jet-cocoon structures. Our model also naturally explains the observed spectrum of energies around a few tens of PeV by summing up heavier nuclei contributions. Additionally, similar reacceleration processes in radio galaxies can contribute to ultrahigh-energy CRs, bridging Galactic and extragalactic origins. Combined with low-energy CRs from supernova remnants and galaxy clusters around the second knee region, this scenario could provide a unified explanation for CRs across the entire energy spectrum.

2025-06-25, **Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe. II: Lightcurve Analysis**, Kaustav K. Das et.al., [2506.20068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20068v1)

 The Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey yielded a sample of 330 Type IIP supernovae (SNe) with well-constrained peak luminosities. In paper I (arXiv:2502.19493), we measured their luminosity function and volumetric rate. Here (paper II), we present the largest systematic study of lightcurve properties for Type IIP SNe from a volume-limited survey, analyzing a selected subset of 129 events, including 16 low-luminosity Type IIP (LLIIP) SNe with M${r,peak} \geq -16$ mag. We find that plateau slope correlates with peak brightness, with many LLIIP SNe showing positive slopes--suggesting smaller progenitor radii and distinct density profiles compared to brighter Type IIP SNe. The plateau duration shows only a weak dependence on peak brightness, likely suggesting binary interaction. One SN exhibits a plateau-to-tail drop of >3.5 mag, consistent with an electron-capture or failed SN with very low or zero nickel mass. We derive explosion and progenitor parameters of the entire Type IIP SN sample using semi-analytical and radiation-hydrodynamical models. Based on radiation-hydrodynamical model fitting, LLIIP SNe are characterized by low nickel masses (0.001-0.025 $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$), low explosion energies (0.1-0.28 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), low ejecta masses ($8.1^{+0.8}\_{-1.7}$ $\mathrm{M\odot}$), and ZAMS masses below 11 $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$. In comparison, the full Type IIP SN sample spans a wider range with nickel masses (0.001-0.222 $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$), explosion energies (0.10-4.43 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), ejecta masses (5.4-24.8 $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$), and ZAMS masses (9.3-16.7 $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$). We find strong correlations between peak brightness, explosion energy, and nickel mass that extend to the low-luminosity end. We conclude that LLIIP SNe represent the faint, low-energy end of the Type IIP population and originate from the lowest-mass core-collapse progenitors.

2025-06-24, **Power-law Emission-line Wings and Radiation-Driven Superwinds in Local Lyman Continuum Emitters**, Lena Komarova et.al., [2506.19623v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19623v1)

 We investigate broad emission-line wings, reaching velocities up to 800 km/s, observed in 26 galaxies with Lyman continuum (LyC) observations, primarily from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS). Using Magellan/MIKE, VLT/X-shooter, and WHT/ISIS high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that this fast gas appears to probe the dominant feedback mechanisms linked to LyC escape. We find that in 14 galaxies, the wings are best fit with power laws with slopes -3.5 to -1.6, with four others best fit by Gaussians of width ~300 km/s; the remaining eight show ambiguous wing morphologies. Gaussian wings are found only at low O32 = [O III]5007/[O II]3726,3729 and high metallicity, while power-law wings span the full range of these parameters. The general evidence suggests a dual-mode paradigm for LyC escape: radiation-driven superwinds traced by power-law wings and supernova-driven feedback traced by Gaussian wings. For the former, the < 3 Myr-old, pre-supernova stellar population correlates with more luminous, faster winds. The data also show that radiation-driven wind parameters like wind luminosity and power-law slope depend on the UV luminosity more than the optically thick covering fraction, consistent with ``picket-fence" radiative transfer. Observed wing slope values flatten with both escaping LyC luminosity and higher extinction, while still preserving the anticorrelation between these two quantities. Additionally, the differential between red and blue slopes implies that extinction and dense gas are centrally concentrated relative to the wind emission. Overall, our results show that power-law emission-line wings probe LyC-driven winds and LyC escape in metal-poor starbursts.

2025-06-24, **The Crab Nebula at subarcsecond resolution with the International LOFAR Telescope**, M. Arias et.al., [2506.19460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19460v1)

 We present International LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Telescope (ILT) observations of the Crab Nebula, the remnant of a core-collapse supernova explosion observed by astronomers in 1054. The field of the Crab Nebula was observed between 120 and 168 MHz as part of the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), and the data were re-processed to include the LOFAR international stations to create a high angular resolution ($0.43'' \times 0.28''$) map at a central frequency of 145 MHz. Combining the ILT map with archival centimeter-range observations of the Nebula with the Very Large Array (VLA) and LOFAR data at 54 MHz, we become sensitive to the effects of free-free absorption against the synchrotron emission of the pulsar wind nebula. This absorption is caused by the ionised filaments visible in optical and infrared data of the Crab Nebula, which are the result of the pulsar wind nebula expanding into the denser stellar ejecta that surrounds it and forming Rayleigh-Taylor fingers. The LOFAR observations are sensitive to two components of these filaments: their dense cores, which show electron densities of $\gtrsim1,000$ cm$^{-3}$, and the diffuse envelopes, with electron densities of $\sim50-250$ cm$^{-3}$. The denser structures have widths of $\sim0.03$ pc, whereas the diffuse component is at one point as large as $0.2$ pc. The morphology of the two components is not always the same. These finding suggests that the layered temperature, density, and ionisation structure of the Crab optical filaments extends to larger scales than previously considered.

2025-06-24, **Elemental Abundances in X-ray Binary Outflows**, Noa Keshet et.al., [2506.19440v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19440v1)

 Line resolved X-ray spectra of outflows from X-ray binaries are interesting since they provide quantifiable measures of the accreted material on to the compact object (black hole or neutron star), which can not be observed directly in the accretion disk. One such measurement that has been largely overlooked is that of the elemental abundances, which potentially provide insights into the origin of the ejected material. Using the Chandra/HETG grating spectrometer we measure and present elemental abundances in four low-mass X-ray binaries. We compare two measurement methods. One is by fitting line series of individual ions and reconstructing the absorption measure distribution (AMD), and the other is a global fit with one or two individual ionization components. All outflows feature a steep AMD strongly favoring high ionization degrees. The present abundances are consistent with previous works suggesting the abundances in the outflows are non-solar. We find a tentative trend of increasing abundances with atomic number, which fits some core-collapse supernova models, but no exact match to a specific one.
