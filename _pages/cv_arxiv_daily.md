2024-04-18, **Neutrinoless double beta decay in the minimal type-I seesaw model: mass-dependent nuclear matrix element, current limits and future sensitivities**, Dong-Liang Fang et.al., [2404.12316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12316v1)

 In this work we discuss the neutrino mass dependent nuclear matrix element (NME) of the neutrinoless double beta decay process and derive the limit on the parameter space of the minimal Type-I seesaw model from the current available experimental data as well as the future sensitivities from the next-generation experiments. Both the explicit many-body calculations and naive extrapolations of the mass dependent NME are employed in the current work. The uncertainties of the theoretical nuclear structure models are taken into account. By combining the latest experimental data from $^{76}$Ge-based experiments, GERDA and MAJORANA, the $^{130}$Te-based experiment, CUORE and the $^{136}$Xe-based experiments, KamLAND-Zen and EXO-200, the bounds on the parameter space of the minimal Type-I seesaw model are obtained and compared with the limits from other experimental probes. Sensitivities for future experiments utilizing $^{76}$Ge-based (LEGEND-1000), $^{82}$Se-based (SuperNEMO), $^{130}$Te based (SNO+II) and $^{136}$Xe-based (nEXO), with a ten-year exposure, are also derived.

2024-04-17, **Annihilation of NMSSM neutralinos and Branching Ratios, Particle Decay Channel of lightest CP odd, even Higgs in NMSSM**, Gayatri Ghosh et.al., [2404.11692v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11692v1)

 We examine neutralino dark matter within the NMSSM framework by conducting a comprehensive analysis of its parameter space. This involves evaluating neutralino capture and annihilation rates within the Sun. The exploration of potential detection strategies for neutralino dark matter in neutrino experiments hinges on the composition of neutralinos and their primary annihilation pathways. Our study also involves reassessing the maximum thresholds for branching ratios of lepton flavour violation decays by directly referencing the constrained limits on $ \Delta a\_{\mu} $ from $ g\_{\mu}-2 $ experiment. This work also presents constraints of muon flux, photon, positron and antiproton flux, specifically its independence from experimental intricacies and the universal applicability of recalculation coefficients across NMSSM model. We also calculate the Branching Ratios, Particle Decay Channel of lightest CP odd, even Higgs in NMSSM.

2024-04-17, **Tunneling away the relic neutrino asymmetry**, Saarik Kalia et.al., [2404.11664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11664v1)

 The Earth acts as a matter potential for relic neutrinos which modifies their index of refraction from vacuum by $\delta\sim10^{-8}$. It has been argued that the refractive effects from this potential should lead to a large $\mathcal O(\sqrt\delta)$ neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry at the surface of the Earth. This result was computed by treating the Earth as flat. In this work, we revisit this calculation in the context of a perfectly spherical Earth. We demonstrate, both numerically and through analytic arguments, that the flat-Earth result is only recovered under the condition $\delta^{3/2}kR\gg1$, where $k$ is the typical momentum of the relic neutrinos and $R$ is the radius of the Earth. This condition is required to prevent antineutrinos from tunneling into classically inaccessible trajectories below the Earth's surface and washing away the large asymmetry. As the physical parameters of the Earth do not satisfy this condition, we find that the asymmetry at the surface should only be $\mathcal O(\delta)$. While the asphericity of the Earth may serve as a loophole to our conclusions, we argue that it is still difficult to generate a large asymmetry even in the presence of local terrain.

2024-04-17, **Neutrino Masses in the Mirror Twin Higgs with Spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Breaking**, Pedro Bittar et.al., [2404.11651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11651v1)

 We introduce a mirror twin Higgs model with spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ symmetry breaking that ameliorates the constraints in twin Higgs cosmology and, at the same time, generates the Standard Model neutrino masses. The model features an $SU(2)$ triplet with hypercharge $1$ alongside its twin counterpart. Spontaneous breaking of both $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ and electroweak symmetry occurs in the scalar sector. The Standard Model neutrinos acquire small masses through the type-II seesaw mechanism. In contrast, their twin counterparts acquire large masses, effectively addressing the dark radiation problem in mirror twin Higgs scenarios. We study the impact of the model on the $N\_{\rm eff.}$ constraints, as well as on collider phenomenology.

2024-04-17, **Explaining Fermions Mass and Mixing Hierarchies through $U(1)_X$ and $Z_2$ Symmetries**, Abdul Rahaman Shaikh et.al., [2404.11570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11570v1)

 For understanding the hierarchies of fermion masses and mixing, we extend the standard model gauge group with $U(1)\_X$ and $Z\_2$ symmetry. The field content of the Standard model is augmented by three heavy right-handed neutrinos and two new scalar singlets. $U(1)\_X$ charges of different fields are considered after satisfying anomaly cancellation conditions. In this scenario, the fermion masses are generated through higher dimensional effective operators. The small neutrino masses are obtained through type-1 seesaw mechanism using the heavy right handed neutrino fields. We discuss the flavor-changing neutral current processes which is originated due to the sequential nature of $U(1)\_X$ symmetry. We have written effective higher dimensional operators in terms of renormalizable dimension four operators by introducing vector like fermions.

2024-04-17, **Stage-IV Cosmic Shear with Modified Gravity and Model-independent Screening**, Maria Tsedrik et.al., [2404.11508v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11508v1)

 We forecast constraints on minimal model-independent parametrisations of several Modified Gravity theories using mock Stage-IV cosmic shear data. We include nonlinear effects and screening, which ensures recovery of General Relativity on small scales. We introduce a power spectrum emulator to accelerate our analysis and evaluate the robustness of the growth index parametrisation with respect to two cosmologies: $\Lambda$CDM and the normal branch of the DGP model. We forecast the uncertainties on the growth index $\gamma$ to be of the order $\sim 10\%$. We find that our halo-model based screening approach demonstrates excellent performance, meeting the precision requirements of Stage-IV surveys. However, neglecting the screening transition results in biased predictions for cosmological parameters. We find that the screening transition shows significant degeneracy with baryonic feedback, requiring a much better understanding of baryonic physics for its detection. Massive neutrinos effects are less prominent and challenging to detect solely with cosmic shear data.

2024-04-17, **Local clustering of relic neutrinos: Comparison of kinetic field theory and the Vlasov equation**, Emil Brinch Holm et.al., [2404.11295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11295v1)

 Gravitational clustering in our cosmic vicinity is expected to lead to an enhancement of the local density of relic neutrinos. We derive expressions for the neutrino density, using a perturbative approach to kinetic field theory and perturbative solutions of the Vlasov equation up to second order. Our work reveals that both formalisms give exactly the same results and can thus be considered equivalent. Numerical evaluation of the local relic neutrino density at first and second order provides some fundamental insights into the frequently applied approach of linear response to neutrino clustering (also known as the Gilbert equation). Against the naive expectation, including the second-order contribution does not lead to an improvement of the prediction for the local relic neutrino density but to a dramatic overestimation. This is because perturbation theory breaks down in a momentum-dependent fashion and in particular for densities well below unity.

2024-04-18, **Constraining Higgs sectors of BSM models -- the case of 95 GeV "Higgs"**, Jan Kalinowski et.al., [2404.12233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12233v1)

 In view of lack of the direct experimental evidence for a Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, accommodating a SM-like Higgs boson is on the most important constraints that a BSM model must fulfill. Already for some time the FlexibleSUSY spectrum generator generator allowed for a reliable prediction of masses and decay patterns of the BSM Higgs boson in a large class of user defined supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models. However, no easy way to compare those predictions with experimental data existed. To that end we present here an interface between FlexibleSUSY and HiggsTools, a computer program assessing in a statistically meaningful way consistency of a BSM Higgs sector with experiments.   Motivated by the recent ATLAS and CMS observation of the di-photon excess at a mass of $\sim$95 GeV we demonstrate the capabilities of our framework by investigating whether the observed low mass excesses around 95 GeV seen in the data can be explained as the lightest scalar of the Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model, without spoiling the SM-like properties of the second-to-lightest state. We also briefly comment on the light dark matter candidate which is a necessarily ingredient of such a setup.

2024-04-18, **Axion Dark Matter from Heavy Quarks**, Mohammad Aghaie et.al., [2404.12199v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12199v1)

 We propose simple scenarios where the observed dark matter abundance arises from decays and scatterings of heavy quarks through freeze-in of an axion-like particle with mass in the $10 {\rm \, keV} - 1 {\rm \, MeV}$ range. These models can be tested by future X-ray telescopes, and in some cases will be almost entirely probed by searches for two-body decays $K \to \pi + {\rm invis.}$ at NA62. As a byproduct, we discuss the cancellation of IR divergencies in flavor-violating scattering processes relevant for thermal axion production, and derive the general contribution to axion-photon couplings from all three light quarks.

2024-04-18, **Strange quark matter as dark matter: 40 years later, a reappraisal**, Francesco Di Clemente et.al., [2404.12094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12094v1)

 Forty years ago, Witten suggested that dark matter could be composed of macroscopic clusters of strange quark matter. This idea was very popular for several years, but it dropped out of fashion once lattice QCD calculations indicated that the confinement/deconfinement transition, at small baryonic chemical potential, is not first order, which seemed to be a crucial requirement in order to produce large clusters of quarks. Here we revisit both the conditions under which strangelets can be produced in the Early Universe and the many phenomenological implications of their existence. Most of the paper discusses the limits on their mass distribution and a possible and simple scheme for their production. Finally, we discuss the most promising techniques to detect this type of objects.

2024-04-18, **Big Bang equivalence of $f(R)$ gravity with no cosmological lithium problem**, Abhijit Talukdar et.al., [2404.12084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12084v1)

 $f(R)$ gravity is one of the serious alternatives of general relativity having large range of astronomical consequences. In this work, we study Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in $f(R)$ gravity theory. We consider modification to gravity due to the existence of primordial black holes in the radiation era which introduce additional degrees of freedom known as scalarons. We calculate the light element abundances by using the BBN code PArthENoPE. It is found that for a range of scalaron mass $(2.2-3.5) \times 10^4$ eV, the abundance of lithium is lowered by $3-4$ times the value predicted by general relativistic BBN which is a level desired to address the cosmological lithium problem. For the above scalaron mass range helium abundance is within observed bound. However, deuterium abundance is found to be increased by $3-6$ times the observed primordial abundance which calls for high efficiency of stellar formation and evolution processes for destruction of the same. A novel relation between scalaron mass and black hole mass has been used to estimate that the above scalaron mass range corresponds to primordial black holes of sub-planetary mass ($\sim 10^{19}$ g) serving as one of the potential non-baryonic dark matter candidates. We infer Big Bang equivalence of power law $f(R)$ gravity with primordial black holes.

2024-04-18, **The relic density and temperature evolution of light dark sector**, Xin-Chen Duan et.al., [2404.12019v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12019v1)

 We have developed a set of four fully coupled Boltzmann equations to precisely determine the relic density and temperature of dark matter by including three distinct sectors: dark matter, light scalar, and standard model sectors. The intricacies of heat transfer between DM and the SM sector through a light scalar particle are explored, inspired by stringent experimental constraints on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle and the DM-scalar coupling. Three distinct sectors emerge prior to DM freeze-out, requiring fully coupled Boltzmann equations to accurately compute relic density. Investigation of forbidden, resonance, and secluded DM scenarios demonstrates significant deviations between established methods and the novel approach with fully coupled Boltzmann equations. Despite increased computational demands, this emphasizes the need for improved precision in relic density calculations, underlining the importance of incorporating these equations in comprehensive analyses.

2024-04-17, **The Field Theory Axiverse**, Stephon Alexander et.al., [2404.11642v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11642v1)

 Axion and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model, and can play an important role in cosmology, serving as dark matter or dark energy, or both, drawing motivation in part from the string theory axiverse. Axion-like particles (ALPs) can also arise as composite degrees of freedom following chiral symmetry breaking in a dark confining gauge theory, analogous to the Standard Model (SM) pion. A dark sector with arbitrary $N\_f$ flavors of dark quarks leads to $N\_f^2-1$ axion-like states, effectively a field theory axiverse (or '$\pi$-axiverse'). A portal to the visible sector can be achieved through the standard kinetic mixing between the dark photon and SM photon, generating millicharges for the dark quarks and consequently couplings, both parity-even and parity-odd, between the SM and the dark pions. This scenario has been studied for the $N\_f=2$ case and more recently for a dark Standard Model with $N\_f=6$. In this work, we study the spectrum of this field theory axiverse for an arbitrary number of flavors, and apply this to the example $N\_f=10$. We calculate the couplings to the SM photon analogous to the conventional axion-photon coupling, including the $N\_f$ and $N\_c$ dependence, and compute the present and future constraints on the $N\_f=10$, $N\_c=3$, $\pi$-axiverse. We elucidate the accompanying 'bary-verse' of superheavy dark baryons, namely an ensemble of charged and neutral dark baryons with a mass set by the dark pion decay constant.

2024-04-17, **Unlocking New Physics with Joint Power Spectrum and Voxel Intensity Distribution Forecasts in Line-Intensity Mapping**, Vivian I. Sabla et.al., [2404.11609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11609v1)

 The power spectrum and voxel intensity distribution (VID) are two summary statistics that can be applied to condense the information encoded in line-intensity maps. The information contained in both summary statistics is highly complementary, and their combination allows for a major increase in precision of parameter estimation from line-intensity mapping (LIM) surveys. Until recently, combination of these statistics required simulation-based estimations of their covariance. In this work we leverage an analytical model of covariance between these observables to run a joint Fisher forecast focusing on the CO(1-0) rotational line targeted by the COMAP survey and a wider, shallower hypothetical iteration. We consider a generalized phenomenological non-CDM model, models with axion dark matter, and local primordial non-Gaussianity, to highlight where a combined analysis of the power spectrum and VID can be most useful. Our results demonstrate improvements in sensitivity to beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics over analyses using either the power spectrum or VID on their own, by factors ranging from 2 to 50, showcasing the potential of joint analyses in unlocking new insights into fundamental physics with LIM surveys.

2024-04-17, **Dark matter, black holes, and gravitational waves**, Gianfranco Bertone et.al., [2404.11513v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11513v1)

 The formation and growth of black holes can strongly influence the distribution of dark matter around them. I discuss here the different types of dark matter overdensities around black holes, including dark matter cusps, spikes, mounds, crests, and gravitational atoms. I then review recent results on the evolution of a black holes binary in presence of dark matter, focusing on the energy transfer between binary and dark matter induced by dynamical friction. Finally, I present the prospects for studying dark matter with gravitational wave observations, and argue that future interferometers might be able to detect and characterise dark matter overdensities around black holes.

2024-04-17, **Modern tools for computing neutron star properties**, Wolfgang Kastaun et.al., [2404.11346v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11346v1)

 Astronomical observations place increasingly tighter and more diverse constraints on the properties of neutron stars (NS). Examples include observations of radio or gamma-ray pulsars, accreting neutron stars and x-ray bursts, magnetar giant flares, and recently, the gravitational waves (GW) from coalescing binary neutron stars. Computing NS properties for a given EOS, such as mass, radius, moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), is therefore an important task. This task is unnecessarily difficult because relevant formulas are scattered throughout the literature and publicly available software tools are far from being complete and easy to use. Further, naive implementations are unreliable in numerical corner cases, most notably when using equations of state (EOS) with phase transitions. To improve the situation, we provide a public library for computing NS properties and handling of EOS data. Further, we include a collection of EOS based on existing nuclear physics models together with precomputed sequences of NS models. All methods are accessible via a Python interface. This article collects all relevant equations and numerical methods in full detail, including a novel formulation for the tidal deformability equations suitable for use with phase transitions. As a sidenote to the topic of ISCOs, we discuss the stability of non-interacting dark matter particle circular orbits inside NSs. Finally, we present some simple applications relevant for parameter estimation studies of GW data. For example, we explore the validity of universal relations, and discuss the appearance of multiple stable branches for parametrized EOS.

2024-04-17, **Accreting Black Holes in Dark Matter Halos**, Sobhan Kazempour et.al., [2404.11333v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11333v1)

 We examine the thin accretion disk behaviors surrounding black holes embedded in cold dark matter halos and scalar field dark matter halos. We first calculate the event horizons and derive the equations of motion and effective potential in black hole geometries with different dark matter halos. We then compute the specific energy, specific angular momentum, and angular velocity of particles moving along circular orbits. We also derive the effective potentials to find the locations of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and compare them to the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes without the dark matter haloes. We also use the observed ISCO of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, to constrain the dark matter halos and discuss the astrophysical Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) generation from systems.

2024-04-17, **High-redshift, small-scale tests of ultralight axion dark matter using Hubble and Webb galaxy UV luminosities**, Harrison Winch et.al., [2404.11071v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11071v1)

 We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation but with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We thus set the first limits on axion DM using a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for m\_{ax} < 10^{-21.6} eV and limit axions with -26 < log(m\_{ax}/eV) < -23 to be less than 22% of the DM (both limits at 95% credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts 4 < z < 10 inaccessible to other cosmological observables. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to fit the results of hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-alpha forest. These high-z measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-z tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-alpha forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-z (z > 10) galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming LambdaCDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos (< 10^9 M\_\odot) at z < 3, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).

2024-04-17, **Exploring Supermassive Compact Dark Matter with the Millilensing Effect of Gamma-Ray Bursts**, Huan Zhou et.al., [2404.11053v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11053v1)

 Gravitational lensing effect is one of most significant observational probes to investigate compact dark matter/objects over a wide mass range. In this work, we first propose to derive the population information and the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter in the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M\_{\odot}$ from 6 millilensed gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates in 3000 Fermi GRB events using the hierarchical Bayesian inference method. We obtain that, for the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M\_{\odot}$, the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter is $f\_{\rm CO}=10^{-1.60}$ in the log-normal mass distribution scenario. This result is in obvious tension with some other observational constraints, e.g. ultra-faint dwarfs and dynamical friction. However, it also was argued that there is only one system in these 6 candidates has been identified as lensed GRB event with fairly high confidence. In this case, the tension would be significantly alleviated. Therefore, it would be an interesting clue for both the millilensed GRB identification and the formation mechanism of supermassive compact dark matter.

2024-04-17, **Strategies for Machine Learning Applied to Noisy HEP Datasets: Modular Solid State Detectors from SuperCDMS**, P. B. Cushman et.al., [2404.10971v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10971v1)

 Background reduction in the SuperCDMS dark matter experiment depends on removing surface events within individual detectors by identifying the location of each incident particle interaction. Position reconstruction is achieved by combining pulse shape information over multiple phonon channels, a task well-suited to machine learning techniques. Data from an Am-241 scan of a SuperCDMS SNOLAB detector was used to study a selection of statistical approaches, including linear regression, artificial neural networks, and symbolic regression. Our results showed that simpler linear regression models were better able than artificial neural networks to generalize on such a noisy and minimal data set, but there are indications that certain architectures and training configurations can counter overfitting tendencies. This study will be repeated on a more complete SuperCDMS data set (in progress) to explore the interplay between data quality and the application of neural networks.

2024-04-18, **Comparing the three-dimensional morphological asymmetries in the ejecta of Kepler and Tycho in X-rays**, Adrien Picquenot et.al., [2404.12002v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12002v1)

 Recent simulations have shown that asymmetries in the ejecta distribution of supernova remnants (SNRs) may be a reflection of asymmetries left over from the initial supernova explosion. Thus, SNR studies provide a vital means for testing and constraining model predictions in relation to the distribution of heavy elements, which are key to improving our understanding of the explosion mechanisms in Type Ia supernovae.   The use of a novel blind source separation method applied to the megasecond X-ray observations of the historic Kepler and Tycho supernova remnants has revealed maps of the ejecta distribution. These maps are endowed with an unprecedented level of detail and clear separations from the continuum emission. Our method also provides a three-dimensional (3D) view of the ejecta by individually disentangling red- and blueshifted spectral components associated with images of the Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe emission. This approach provides insights into the morphology of the ejecta distribution in those two remnants.   Those mappings have allowed us to thoroughly investigate the asymmetries in the intermediate-mass elements and Fe distribution in two Type Ia supernova remnants. We also compared the results with the core-collapse Cassiopeia A remnant, which we had studied previously. The images obtained confirm, as expected for Type Ia SNRs, that the Fe distribution is mostly closer to the core than that of intermediate-mass elements. They also highlight peculiar features in the ejecta distribution, such as the Fe-rich southeastern knot in Tycho.

2024-04-18, **Dark supernova remnant buried in the Galactic-Centre "Brick" G0.253+0.016 revealed by an expanding CO-line bubble**, Yoshiaki Sofue et.al., [2404.11892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11892v1)

 We performed a $^{12}$CO- and $^{13}$CO($J=1-0$)-line study of the "Brick" (G0.253+0.016) in the Galactic Centre (GC) by analyzing the archival data obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. We present kinematics and molecular gas distributions in the longitude-velocity diagrams, and suggest that the Brick is located along the GC Arm I in the central molecular zone (CMZ) in front of the GC, which yields a distance of 8 kpc and GC radius 0.2 kpc. The major and minor-axis diameters of the Brick are $D\_x\times D\_y=8.4 \ {\rm pc} \times 4.1 \ {\rm pc}$, and the scale radius is $r\_{\rm bri}=\sqrt{D\_x D\_y}=2.96$ pc. The molecular mass inferred from the CO-line integrated intensity is $M\_{\rm brixco} \sim 5.1\times 10^4 M\_\odot$ for a conversion factor $X\_{\rm gc}=1.0\times 10^{20}$ H$\_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km s$^{-1}$]$^{-1}$, while the Virial mass for the velocity dispersion of $\sigma\_v=10.0 $ km s $^{-1}$ is calculated to be $M\_{\rm brivir}\sim 6.8 \times 10^4 \ M\_\odot$, which yields a new conversion factor of $X\_{\rm bri} =1.3\times 10^{20}$ H$\_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km s$^{-1}$]$^{-1}$. No thermal radio emission indicative of HII region and star formation is found in radio-continuum archive. The Brick's center has a cavity surrounded by a spherical molecular bubble of radius $r\_{\rm bub}=1.85$ pc and mass $\sim 1.7\times 10^4 M\_\odot$ expanding at $v\_{\rm exp}=10$ km s$^{-1}$ with kinetic energy of $E\_0\sim 1.7\times 10^{49}$ erg. If the bubble is approximated by an adiabatic spherical shock wave, its age is $t\sim 2/5 r\_{\rm bub}/v\_{\rm exp}\sim 7.2\times 10^4$ y. We suggest that the bubble will be a dark supernova remnant buried in the dense molecular cloud. The Brick, therefore, experienced massive-star formation followed by a supernova explosion more than $\sim 10^5$ y ago.

2024-04-17, **Detecting gravitational wave signals using a flexible model for the amplitude and frequency evolution**, Toral Gupta et.al., [2404.11719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11719v1)

 We currently lack good waveform models for many gravitational wave sources. Examples where models are lacking include neutron star post merger signals, core collapse supernovae, and signals of unknown origin. Wavelet based techniques have proven effective at detecting and characterizing these signals. Here we introduce a new method that uses collections of evolving amplitude-frequency tracks, or "voices", to model generic gravitational wave signals. The analysis is implemented using trans-dimensional Bayesian inference, building on the earlier wavelet-based BayesWave algorithm. The new algorithm, BayesWaveVoices, outperforms the original for long duration signals.

2024-04-17, **Joint r-Process Enrichment by Supernovae with a Metallicity Threshold and Neutron Star Mergers**, Takuji Tsujimoto et.al., [2404.11668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11668v1)

 The enrichment history of $r$-process elements has been imprinted on the stellar abundances that change in accordance with increasing metallicity in galaxies. Close examination of the [Eu/Fe] feature caused by stars in nearby galaxies, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), shows its perplexity. The decreasing trend of the [Eu/Fe] feature is followed by a nearly constant value; this trend is generally attributed to an onset of the delayed Fe release from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which is the same interpretation of the [$\alpha$/Fe] feature. However, this feature appears in the LMC at [Fe/H] of approximately -0.7, which is significantly higher than that for the [alpha/Fe] case ($\approx$ -2). This result potentially indicates the presence of an overlooked property of the $r$-process site that remains unseen in the study of the Milky Way. Here, we propose that this [Eu/Fe]-knee feature is created by a fade-out of core-collapse SNe producing $r$-process elements; these elements along with neutron star mergers (NSMs) promote the $r$-process enrichment under the condition for this specific SNe such that their occurrence is limited to a low-metallicity environment. This metallicity threshold for the occurrence rate of $r$-process SNe at a subsolar is nearly identical to that for long gamma-ray bursts whose origin may be connected to fast-rotating massive stars. Moreover, we reason that the contribution of Eu from NSMs is crucial to maintain a high [Eu/Fe] at an early stage in dwarf galaxies by a balance with Fe from SNe Ia; both enrichments via NSMs and SNe Ia proceed with similar delay time distributions.

2024-04-17, **The Reliability of Type Ia Supernovae Delay Time Distributions Recovered from Galaxy Star Formation Histories**, Bhavin A. Joshi et.al., [2404.11555v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11555v1)

 We present a numerical analysis investigating the reliability of type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) delay-time distributions recovered from individual host galaxy star-formation histories. We utilize star-formation histories of mock samples of galaxies generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation at two redshifts to recover delay-time distributions. The delay-time distributions are constructed through piecewise constants as opposed to typically employed parametric forms such as power-laws or Gaussian or skew/log-normal functions. The SN~Ia delay-time distributions are recovered through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration of the likelihood space by comparing the expected SN Ia rate within each mock galaxy to the observed rate. We show that a reduced representative sample of \emph{non-host} galaxies is sufficient to reliably recover delay-time distributions while simultaneously reducing the computational load. We also highlight a potential systematic between recovered delay-time distributions and the mass-weighted ages of the underlying host galaxy stellar population.

2024-04-17, **Resolved properties of a luminous "hinge clump" in the compact group of galaxies NGC\,6845**, Daniela E. Olave-Rojas et.al., [2404.11549v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11549v1)

 We study the properties of one of the most luminous hinge clumps, located on the compact group of galaxies NGC6845. Using IFS from GMOS/Gemini, complemented with archival MUSE data, we obtain oxygen abundances, ages, star formation rates, velocity fields and we also performed a single stellar populations modeling to understand the SFH of the hinge clump localized in NGC6845. We found that the hinge clump sits in a tail, having a SFR of 3.4$M\_{\odot}yr^{-1}$, which is comparable with a few other extreme cases, e.g., the star clusters in the Antennae galaxy and other reported hinge clumps in the literature. In fact, this clump represents ~15\% of total SFR of NGC6845A. Large-scale modeling of the observed velocity field of NGC6845A rules out the scenario on which this hinge clump was a satellite galaxy. Indeed, its kinematics is compatible with the galactic disk of NGC6845A. Its abundance, mean value of 0.4Z$\_{\odot}$, is also consistent with the metallicity gradient of the galaxy. Our analysis, suggest that the hinge clump is formed by multiple stellar populations instead of a single burst, thus having a large range of ages. We found that central clump is encompassed by a ring-like structure, suggesting that the ring-like structure represents a second-generation of star formation. In addition, the analysis of the diagnostic diagram indicates that this central region can also be being ionized by shock from stellar and supernovae winds. Finally, the derived SFR density $\Sigma=9.7M\_{\odot}yr^{-1}kpc^{-2}$ of the central clump, place it in starburst regime, where gas inflows should provide gas to maintain the star formation. This work shows a resolved example of an extreme localized starburst in a compact group of galaxies.

2024-04-17, **How robust are the parameter constraints extending the $Λ$CDM model?**, Stefano Gariazzo et.al., [2404.11182v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11182v1)

 We present model-marginalized limits on the six standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters ($\Omega\_{\rm c} h^2$, $\Omega\_{\rm b} h^2$, $\theta\_{\rm MC}$, $\tau\_{\rm reio}$, $n\_s$ and $A\_s$), as well as on selected derived quantities ($H\_0$, $\Omega\_{\rm m}$, $\sigma\_8$, $S\_8$ and $r\_{\rm drag}$), obtained by considering three independent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments: the Planck satellite, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and South Pole Telescope. We also consider low redshift observations in the form of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey and Supernovae (SN) distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon-Plus catalog. The marginalized errors are stable against the different fiducial cosmologies explored in this study. The largest impact on the parameter accuracy is produced by varying the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom ($N\_{\rm eff}$) or the lensing amplitude ($A\_{\rm lens}$). Nevertheless the marginalized errors on some derived parameters such as $H\_0$ or $\Omega\_{\rm m}$ can be up to two orders of magnitude larger than in the canonical $\Lambda$CDM scenario when considering only CMB data. In these cases, low redshift measurements are crucial for restoring the stability of the marginalized cosmological errors computed here. Overall, our results underscore remarkable stability in the mean values and precision of the main cosmological parameters, making irrelevant the choice of different possible cosmological scenarios once both high and low redshift probes are fully accounted for. The very same results should be understood as a tool to test exotic cosmological scenarios, as the marginalized values should be used in numerical analyses due to their robustness and slightly larger errors, providing a more realistic and conservative approach.

2024-04-17, **Search for synchrotron emission from secondary electrons of proton-proton interaction in Galactic PeVatron candidate HESS J1641$-$463**, Naomi Tsuji et.al., [2404.11012v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11012v1)

 HESS J1641-463 is an unidentified gamma-ray source with a hard TeV gamma-ray spectrum, and thus it has been proposed to be a possible candidate for cosmic ray (CR) accelerators up to PeV energies (a PeVatron candidate). The source spatially coincides with the radio supernova remnant (SNR) G338.5+0.1, but has not yet been fully explored in the X-ray band. We analyzed newly taken NuSTAR data, pointing at HESS J1641-463, with 82 ks effective exposure time. There is no apparent X-ray counterpart of HESS J1641-463, while nearby stellar cluster, Mercer 81, and stray-light X-rays are detected. Combined with the archival Chandra data, partially covering the source, we derived an upper limit of $\sim 6\times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in 2-10 keV ($\sim 3\times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in 10-20 keV). If the gamma-ray emission is originated from decay of $\pi^0$ mesons produced in interactions between CR protons and ambient materials, secondary electrons in the proton-proton interactions can potentially emit synchrotron photons in the X-ray band, which can be tested by our X-ray observations. Although the obtained X-ray upper limits cannot place a constraint on the primary proton spectrum, it will be possible with a future hard X-ray mission.
