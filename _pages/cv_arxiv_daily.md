2023-08-15, **Renormalization of a Standard Model Extension with a Dark Abelian Sector and Predictions for the W-Boson Mass**, Stefan Dittmaier et.al., [2308.07845v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07845v1)

 The described Dark Abelian Sector Model (DASM) extends the Standard Model (SM) by a ``dark'' sector containing a spontaneously broken $U(1)\_\text{d}$ gauge group. Keeping this dark sector quite generic we only add one additional Higgs boson, one Dirac fermion, and right-handed SM-like neutrinos to the SM. Using the only two singlet operators of the SM with dimension less than 4 (the $U(1)\_\text{Y}$ field-strength tensor and the SM Higgs mass operator $\|\Phi\|^2$) as well as the right-handed neutrino fields we open up three portals to the dark sector. Dark sectors, such as the one of the DASM, that introduce an additional Higgs boson $\text{H}$ as well as an additional $\text{Z}'$ gauge boson can have a large influence on the predictions for electroweak precision observables and even accommodate possible dark matter candidates. We consider one of the two Higgs bosons to be the known $125\,\text{GeV}$ Higgs boson and parameterize the extension of the scalar sector by the mass of the second Higgs boson, the Higgs mixing angle, and a Higgs self-coupling. We do not assume any mass hierarchy in the gauge sector and use the mass of the additional $\text{Z}'$ boson and a corresponding gauge-boson mixing angle to parameterize the extension of the gauge sector. The fermion sector is parameterized by the mass of the additional fermion and a fermion mixing angle. We describe an on-shell as well as an $\overline{\text{MS}}$ renormalization scheme for the DASM sectors and give explicit results for the renormalization constants at the 1-loop level, and, thus, prepare the ground for full NLO predictions for collider observables in the DASM. As a first example, we provide the DASM prediction for the W-boson mass derived from muon decay.

2023-08-15, **Joint measurement of the ultra-high-energy neutrino spectrum and cross section**, Victor B. Valera et.al., [2308.07709v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07709v1)

 Soon, a new generation of neutrino telescopes, presently under planning, will target the discovery of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos of cosmic origin, with energies higher than 100 PeV, that promise unique insight into astrophysics and particle physics. Yet, predictions of the UHE neutrino flux and interaction cross section -- whose measurement is co-dependent -- are laden with significant uncertainty that, if unaddressed, could misrepresent the capabilities to measure one or the other. To address this, we advocate for the joint measurement of the UHE neutrino spectrum and neutrino-nucleon cross section, including of their energy dependence, without assuming prior knowledge of either. We illustrate our methods by adopting empirical parametrizations of the neutrino spectrum, in forecasts geared to the planned radio array of the IceCube-Gen2 neutrino telescope. We warn against using simple parametrizations -- a simple power law or one augmented with an exponential cut-off -- that might fail to capture features of the spectrum that are commonplace in the predictions. We argue instead for the use of flexible parametrizations -- a piecewise power law or an interpolating polynomial -- that ensure accuracy. We report loose design targets for the detector energy and angular resolution that are compatible with those under present consideration.

2023-08-15, **Search for Extremely High Energy Neutrinos with IceCube**, Maximilian Meier et.al., [2308.07656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07656v1)

 Extremely high energy (EHE) neutrinos (with energies above $10^7$ GeV) are produced in interactions of the highest energy cosmic rays. A primary contribution to the EHE neutrino flux is expected from so-called cosmogenic neutrinos produced when ultra high energy cosmic rays interact with ambient photon backgrounds. Observations of these EHE neutrinos with IceCube can probe the nature of cosmic rays beyond the energies for resonant photo-pion production (GZK cutoff). We present a new event selection of extremely high energy neutrinos by more effectively identifying and rejecting high multiplicity muon bundles with respect to previous analyses. Furthermore, we show the expected improvements of the quasi-differential upper limits on the EHE neutrino flux using 12 years of IceCube data.

2023-08-15, **Multiwavelength Observations of the Blazar PKS~0735+178 in Spatial and Temporal Coincidence with an Astrophysical Neutrino Candidate IceCube-211208A**, M. Pohl et.al., [2308.07643v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07643v1)

 We report on multiwavelength target-of-opportunity observations of the blazar PKS 0735+178, located 2.2 degrees away from the best-fit position of the IceCube neutrino event 211208A. The source was in a high-flux state in the optical, ultraviolet, X-ray, and GeV gamma-ray bands around the time of the neutrino event, exhibiting daily variability in the soft X-ray flux. The X-ray data from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR characterize the transition between the low-energy and high-energy components of the broadband spectral energy distribution, and the gamma-ray data from Fermi-LAT, VERITAS, and H.E.S.S. require a spectral cut-off near 100 GeV. Both measurements provide strong constraints on leptonic and hadronic models. We analytically explore a synchrotron self-Compton model, an external Compton model, and a lepto-hadronic model. Models that are entirely based on internal photon fields face serious difficulties in matching the observed spectral energy distribution (SED). The existence of an external photon field in the source would instead explain the observed gamma-ray spectral cut-off in both leptonic and lepto-hadronic models, and it would allow a proton jet power that marginally agrees with the Eddington limit in the lepto-hadronic model. A numerical lepto-hadronic model with external target photons reproduces the observed SED and is reasonably consistent with the neutrino event despite requiring a high jet power.

2023-08-15, **Sensitivity to CP Discovery in the Presence of Lorentz Invariance Violating Potential at T2HK/T2HKK**, Supriya Pan et.al., [2308.07566v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07566v1)

 Investigation of conservation/violation of CP symmetry in the leptonic sector is very essential in understanding the evolution of the universe. Lorentz invariance and CPT are fundamental symmetries of nature. The violation of Lorentz invariance can also lead to CPT violations. The standard three flavour neutrino oscillation framework presents a scenario to observe the signature of Lorentz invariance and CP violations. This work focuses on the effect of Lorentz invariance violating (LIV) parameters on the sensitivity to CP violation. We investigate the sensitivity in two proposed configurations of the upcoming T2HK experiment: (i) one detector each placed at 295 km and 1100 km, and (ii) two identical detectors at 295 km. This study probes the effect of CPT violating parameters $a\_{e\mu},a\_{e\tau},a\_{\mu\tau}$.

2023-08-14, **Neutrino charge radius and electromagnetic dipole moments via scalar and vector leptoquarks**, A. Bolaños-Carrera et.al., [2308.07493v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07493v1)

 The one-loop contribution of scalar and vector leptoquarks (LQs) to the electromagnetic properties (NEPs) of massive Dirac neutrinos is presented via an effective Lagrangian approach, with emphasis on the effective neutrino charge radius (NCR), which has never been calculated and is obtained by the background field formalism in a Yang-Mills-like scenario for gauge LQs. Analytical results for nonzero neutrino mass are presented in terms of both Feynman-parameter integrals and Passarino-Veltman scalar functions, which can be useful to obtain the NEPs of heavy neutrinos, out of which approximate expressions are obtained for light neutrinos. For the numerical analysis we concentrate on the only renormalizable scalar and vector LQ representations that do not need extra symmetries to forbid tree-level proton decay. Constraints on the parameter space consistent with current experimental data are then discussed and it is found that the LQ representations $\widetilde{R}\_2$ and $U\_1$ could yield the largest contributions to the NEPs provided that they have couplings to both left- and right-handed neutrinos of the order of $O(1)$. For a LQ mass of $1.5$ TeV, the magnetic dipole moment (MDM) of the tau neutrino can be of the order of $10^{-9}$ $\mu\_B$, whereas its neutrino electric dipole moment (EDM) can reach values as high as $10^{-20}$-$10^{-19}$ ecm. On the other hand, the NCR can reach values up to $10^{-35}$ cm$^2$ regardless of the neutrino flavor and even in the absence of right-handed neutrinos. In the latter scenario, the EDM vanishes and the contribution to neutrino MDM would be negligible, of the order of $10^{-14}$ $\mu\_B$ for the tau neutrino, whereas those for the muon and electron neutrinos would be about two and seven orders of magnitude smaller, respectively. Our estimates could be severely suppressed due to a possible suppression of the LQ coupling constants.

2023-08-14, **Benefits of Looking for Coincident Events, Taus, and Muons with the Askaryan Radio Array**, Abby Bishop et.al., [2308.07401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07401v1)

 Ultra-High Energy (UHE) neutrinos over $10^{16}$ eV have yet to be observed but the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is one in-ice neutrino observatory attempting to make this discovery. In anticipation of a thorough full-observatory and full-livetime neutrino search, we estimate how many neutrino events can be detected accounting for secondary interactions, which are typically ignored in UHE neutrino simulations. Using the NuLeptonSim and PyREx simulation frameworks, we calculate the abundance and usefulness of cascades viewed by multiple ARA stations and observations made of taus, muons, and neutrinos generated during and after initial neutrino cascades. Analyses that include these scenarios benefit from a considerable increase in effective area at key ARA neutrino energies, one example being a 30% increase in ARA's effective area when simulating taus and muons produced in $10^{19}$ eV neutrino interactions. These analysis techniques could be utilized by other in-ice radio neutrino observatories, as has been explored by NuRadioMC developers. Our contribution showcases full simulation results of neutrinos with energies $3\times10^{17}$ - $10^{21}$ eV and visualizations of interesting triggered event topologies.

2023-08-14, **Muonic Force and Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions at Muon Colliders**, Sudip Jana et.al., [2308.07375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07375v1)

 The discovery of neutrino oscillations implies that neutrinos are massive and mixed, necessitating an extension of the Standard Model, which may require the introduction of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI). We investigate the potential of a high-energy muon collider to probe such NSIs with muons, specifically focusing on muonic forces. By analyzing the monophoton signal from the process $\mu^+ \mu^- \rightarrow \nu \overline{\nu } \gamma$, we explore four-fermion contact interactions involving two muons and two neutrinos. Moreover, we examine minimal models that generate scalar and vector-mediated NSIs and study their phenomenology. Projected sensitivities for the strength of NSIs, $\epsilon\_{\alpha \beta}^{\mu \mu}$, are presented at a 95$\%$ confidence level for a center-of-mass energy of 3 TeV and integrated luminosities of $\mathcal{L} = 1$ and $10~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$, showcasing the complementarity between a muon collider and other experimental probes.

2023-08-14, **Finite Naturalness and Quark-Lepton Unification**, Pavel Fileviez Perez et.al., [2308.07367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07367v1)

 We study the implications of finite naturalness in Pati-Salam models where SU(3)c is embedded in SU(4). For the minimal realization at low scale of quark-lepton unification, which employs the inverse seesaw for neutrino masses, we find that radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass are at least $\delta m\_h^2/m\_h^2 \sim {\cal O}(10^3)$. We find that the one-loop contributions to the Higgs mass are suppressed by four powers of the hypercharge gauge coupling. Naively, the two-loop contributions involving the heavy vector bosons are large. We find that for the vector leptoquarks these two-loop corrections cancel when the Dirac Yukawa couplings for neutrinos are equal to the up-type quark Yukawa couplings as predicted in the minimal theory for quark-lepton unification. We show that the two-loop corrections to the Higgs mass involving the new heavy neutral gauge boson are suppressed. We mention a way to relax the lower bound on the vector leptoquark mass and have $\delta m\_h^2/m\_h^2 \sim {\cal O}(1)$.

2023-08-14, **Heavy neutrino-antineutrino oscillations at the FCC-ee**, Stefan Antusch et.al., [2308.07297v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07297v1)

 We discuss the impact of heavy neutrino-antineutrino oscillations (NNOs) on heavy neutral lepton (HNL) searches at proposed electron-positron colliders such as the future circular $e^+e^-$ collider (FCC-ee). During the $Z$ pole run, HNLs can be produced alongside a light neutrino or antineutrino that escapes detection and can decay into a charged lepton or antilepton together with an off-shell $W$ boson. In this case, signals of lepton number violation only show up in the final state distributions. We discuss how NNOs, a typical feature of collider-testable low-scale seesaw models where the heavy neutrinos form pseudo-Dirac pairs, modify such final state distributions. For example, the forward-backward asymmetry (FBA) of the reconstructed heavy (anti)neutrinos develops an oscillatory dependence on the HNL lifetime. We show that these oscillations can be resolvable for long-lived HNLs. We also discuss that when the NNOs are not resolvable, they can nevertheless significantly modify the theory predictions for FBAs and observables such as the ratio of the total number of HNL decays into $\ell^-$ over ones into $\ell^+$, in an interval of the angle~$\theta$ between the HNL and the beam axis. Our results show that NNOs should be included in collider simulations of HNLs at the FCCee.

2023-08-14, **Calibration and Physics with ARA Station 1: A Unique Askaryan Radio Array Detector**, M. F. H Seikh et.al., [2308.07292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07292v1)

 The Askaryan Radio Array Station 1 (A1), the first among five autonomous stations deployed for the ARA experiment at the South Pole, is a unique ultra-high energy neutrino (UHEN) detector based on the Askaryan effect that uses Antarctic ice as the detector medium. Its 16 radio antennas (distributed across 4 strings, each with 2 Vertically Polarized (VPol), 2 Horizontally Polarized (HPol) receivers), and 2 strings of transmitting antennas (calibration pulsers, CPs), each with 1 VPol and 1 HPol channel, are deployed at depths less than 100 m within the shallow firn zone of the 2.8 km thick South Pole (SP) ice. We apply different methods to calibrate its Ice Ray Sampler second generation (IRS2) chip for timing offset and ADC-to-Voltage conversion factors using a known continuous wave input signal to the digitizer, and achieve a precision of sub-nanoseconds. We achieve better calibration for odd, compared to even samples, and also find that the HPols under-perform relative to the VPol channels. Our timing calibrated data is subsequently used to calibrate the ADC-to-Voltage conversion as well as precise antenna locations, as a precursor to vertex reconstruction. The calibrated data will then be analyzed for UHEN signals in the final step of data compression. The ability of A1 to scan the firn region of SP ice sheet will contribute greatly towards a 5-station analysis and will inform the design of the planned IceCube Gen-2 radio array.

2023-08-14, **Operations plans and sensitivities of the IceCube Upgrade Camera System**, Steven Rodan et.al., [2308.07276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07276v1)

 The IceCube Upgrade consists of seven new strings to be deployed in the central region of the existing IceCube detector. The goals of the IceCube Upgrade are two-fold: to enhance sensitivity to neutrinos in the GeV range, and to improve the calibration of the IceCube detector as a means of reducing systematic uncertainties due to the optical properties of the ice. Among other calibration devices designed to study ice properties, a novel camera system will be deployed as part of the Upgrade. The system will include three cameras, each paired with an illumination LED, included in each of the Upgrade optical modules. In total, 2,300 cameras will be deployed. A combination of photographic images from transmitted and reflected light will measure optical properties of both the bulk ice in-between strings and the local ice refrozen in the drill hole. In this contribution, we present the operations plans for these two types of measurements and the sensitivities to the ice properties and geometry of the new modules that can be achieved with the new camera system.

2023-08-14, **Multimessenger Potential of the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland**, Marco Stein Muzio et.al., [2308.07224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07224v1)

 The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is the only ultrahigh energy (UHE, ${\gtrsim}30$~PeV) neutrino monitor of the Northern sky and will soon be the world's most sensitive high-uptime detector of UHE neutrinos. Because of this, RNO-G represents an important piece of the multimessenger landscape over the next decade. In this talk, we will highlight RNO-G's multimessenger capabilities and its potential to provide key information in the search for the most extreme astrophysical accelerators. In particular, we will highlight opportunities enabled by RNO-G's unique field-of-view, its potential to constrain the sources of UHE cosmic rays, and its complementarity with IceCube at lower energies.

 We present the extent to which anisotropies in the ultrahigh energy neutrino sky can probe the distribution of extreme astrophysical accelerators in the universe. In this talk, we discuss the origin of an anisotropic neutrino sky and show how observers can use this anisotropy to measure the evolution of ultrahigh energy neutrino sources - and therefore, the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays - for the very first time.

2023-08-14, **Projections of Discovery Potentials from Expected Background**, M. K. Singh et.al., [2308.07049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07049v1)

 Background with certain uncertainties are usually known in searches of novel phenomena prior to the experiments are conducted at their design stage. We quantitatively study the projected sensitivities in terms of discovery potentials. These are essential for the optimizations of the experimental specifications as well as of the cost-effectiveness in various investment. Sensitivities in counting analysis are derived with complete Poisson statistics and its continuous approximation, and are compared with those using maximum likelihood analysis in which additional measurables are included as signatures. The roles and effects due to uncertainties in the background estimates are studied. Two expected features to establish positive effects are verified and quantified: (i) In counting-only experiments, the required signal strength can be derived with complete Poisson analysis, and the continuous approximation would underestimate the results. (ii) Incorporating continuous variables as additional constraints would reduce the required signal strength relative to that of counting-only analysis. The formulations are applied to the case on the experimental searches of neutrinoless double beta decay in which both ambient and two-neutrino background are considered.

2023-08-14, **Astro-COLIBRI: An Advanced Platform for Real-Time Multi-Messenger Astrophysics**, Fabian Schüssler et.al., [2308.07044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07044v1)

 Observations of transient phenomena like Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares and explosions (novae and supernovae), combined with the detection of novel cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has revolutionized astrophysics over the last years. The discovery potential of both ulti-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations as well as serendipitous observations could be maximized with a novel tool which allows for quickly acquiring an overview over relevant information associated with each new detection. Here we present Astro-COLIBRI, a novel and comprehensive platform for this challenge.   Astro-COLIBRI's architecture comprises a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system and a website as well as apps for iOS and Android as clients for users. Astro-COLIBRI evaluates incoming messages of astronomical observations from all available alert streams in real time, filters them by user specified criteria and puts them into their MWL and MM context. The clients provide a graphical representation with an easy to grasp summary of the relevant data to allow for the fast identification of interesting phenomena, provides an assessment of observing conditions at a large selection of observatories around the world, and much more.   Here the key features of Astro-COLIBRI are presented. We outline the architecture, summarize the used data resources, and provide examples for applications and use cases. Focussing on the high-energy domain, we'll discuss the use of the platform in searches for high-energy gamma-ray counterparts to high-energy neutrinos, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves.

2023-08-14, **The Scale Invariant Vacuum Paradigm: Main Results plus the Current BBNS Progress**, Vesselin G. Gueorguiev et.al., [2308.07483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07483v1)

 We summarize the main results within the Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm as related to the Weyl Integrable Geometry (WIG) as an extension to the standard Einstein General Relativity (EGR). After a short sketch of the mathematical framework, the main results until 2023 [1] are highlighted in relation to: the inflation within the SIV [2], the growth of the density fluctuations [3], the application of the SIV to scale-invariant dynamics of galaxies, MOND, dark matter, and the dwarf spheroidals [4],and the most recent results on the BBNS light-elements' abundances within the SIV [5]. Keywords: cosmology: theory, dark matter, dark energy, inflation, BBNS; galaxies: formation, rotation; Weyl integrable geometry; Dirac co-calculus.

2023-08-14, **Small-scale stellar haloes: detecting low surface brightness features in the outskirts of Milky Way dwarf satellites**, Jaclyn Jensen et.al., [2308.07394v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07394v1)

 Dwarf galaxies are valuable laboratories for dynamical studies related to dark matter and galaxy evolution, yet it is currently unknown just how physically extended their stellar components are. Satellites orbiting the Galaxy's potential may undergo tidal stripping by the host, or alternatively, may themselves have accreted smaller systems whose debris populates the dwarf's own stellar halo. Evidence of these past interactions, if present, is best searched for in the outskirts of the satellite. However, foreground contamination dominates the signal at these large radial distances, making observation of stars in these regions difficult. In this work, we introduce an updated algorithm for application to Gaia data that identifies candidate member stars of dwarf galaxies, based on spatial, color-magnitude and proper motion information, and which allows for an outer component to the stellar distribution. Our method shows excellent consistency with spectroscopically confirmed members from the literature despite having no requirement for radial velocity information. We apply the algorithm to all $\sim$60 Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites, and we find 9 dwarfs (Bo\"otes 1, Bo\"otes 3, Draco 2, Grus 2, Segue 1, Sculptor, Tucana 2, Tucana 3, and Ursa Minor) that exhibit evidence for a secondary, low-density outer profile. We identify many member stars which are located beyond 5 half-light radii (and in some cases, beyond 10). We argue these distant stars are likely tracers of dwarf stellar haloes or tidal streams, though ongoing spectroscopic follow-up will be required to determine the origin of these extended stellar populations.

2023-08-14, **A New Cosmological Model: Exploring the Evolution of the Universe and Unveiling Super-Accelerated Expansion**, Himanshu Chaudhary et.al., [2308.07354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07354v1)

 In this paper, we present a cosmological model designed to study the evolution of the universe based on a new parametrization of the deceleration parameter. The model considers a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe filled with radiation, dark matter (DM), and dark energy (DE). We derive the Friedmann equations and the energy conservation equation for the universe, accounting for separate conservation equations for radiation, DM, and DE. Our proposed deceleration parameter is given by a formula involving constants $H\_{0}$, $\Omega\_{r0}$, $\Omega\_{m0}$, $q\_{2}$, $q\_{1}$, $q\_{0}$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. which we subsequently fit to observational data. To assess the model's viability, we compare it with a diverse range of observational data, including cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background measurements. Employing the chi-square statistic and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we estimate the best-fit values for the free parameters and investigate the constraints imposed by observational data on the model. Our results indicate that our cosmological model provides an excellent fit to the observed data and exhibits a remarkable agreement with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm at higher redshifts. However, the most intriguing discovery lies in the model's prediction of a super-accelerated expansion in the distant future, in contrast to the de Sitter phase predicted by $\Lambda$CDM. This implies the presence of dark energy driving the universe's accelerated expansion. These findings suggest that our proposed cosmological model offers a compelling alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, shedding new light on the nature of dark energy and the future fate of the cosmos.

2023-08-14, **Full analysis of the scalar-induced gravitational waves for the curvature perturbation with local-type non-Gaussianities**, Chen Yuan et.al., [2308.07155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07155v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are supposed to form through the gravitational collapse of regions with large density fluctuations. The formation of PBHs inevitably leads to the emission of scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) signals, offering a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis of PBHs as a constituent of dark matter (DM). Previous studies have calculated the energy spectrum of SIGWs in local-type non-Gaussian models, primarily considering the contributions from the $F\_{\mathrm{NL}}$-order or the $G\_{\mathrm{NL}}$-order while neglecting connected diagrams. In this study, we extend the previous work by (i) considering the full contribution of non-Gaussian diagrams up to the $G\_{\mathrm{NL}}$-order; (ii) deriving the generic scaling of the SIGW energy spectrum in the infrared region. We derive semi-analytical results applicable to arbitrary primordial power spectra and numerically evaluate the energy spectrum of SIGWs for a log-normal power spectrum.

2023-08-14, **Kinetically Coupled Scalar Fields Model and Cosmological Tensions**, Gang Liu et.al., [2308.07069v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07069v1)

 In this paper, we investigate the kinetically coupled early dark energy (EDE) and scalar field dark matter to address cosmological tensions. The EDE model presents an intriguing theoretical approach to resolving the Hubble tension, but it introduces challenges such as the "why then" problem of why EDE was injected during the epoch of matter-radiation equality, and exacerbates existing large-scale structure tension. Therefore, we consider the interaction between dark matter and EDE, such that the dynamics of EDE are triggered by the dark matter, and the drag effect of dark energy on dark matter suppresses structure growth, which can alleviate large-scale structure tension. We replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter, which has the property of suppressing structure growth on small scales. We employed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the model parameters by utilising a variety of cosmological data, our new model reveals a non-zero coupling constant of $0.030 \pm 0.026$ at a 68\% confidence level. The coupled model yields a Hubble constant value of $72.38^{+0.71}\_{-0.82}$ \,km\,/\,s\,/\,Mpc, which resolves the Hubble tension. However, similar to the EDE model, it also obtains a larger $S\_8$ value compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, further exacerbating the large-scale structure tension. The best-fit $S\_8$ value for the EDE model is $0.8316$, whereas our new model yields a smaller value of $0.8134$. Additionally, the coupled model exhibits a smaller $\chi^2\_\mathrm{tot}$ value compared to the EDE model and the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating a better fit to the data.

2023-08-14, **Dark Coloured Scalars Impact on Single and Di-Higgs Production at the LHC**, Pedro Gabriel et.al., [2308.07023v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07023v1)

 The search for Dark Matter (DM) at colliders is primarily pursued via the detection of missing energy in particular final states. These searches are based on the production and decay processes where final states include DM particles and at least one Standard Model (SM) particle. DM will then reveal itself as missing energy. An alternative form to get a hint of a dark sector is via loop contribution to SM processes. In this case, it is not even relevant if the new particles have their origin in the dark sector of the model. In this work we discuss the impact of an arbitrary number of coloured scalars in single Higgs and double Higgs production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and we show their complementarity. We determine the range of variation of the corrections relative to the SM for an arbitrary number of coloured scalars $n$, and discuss in more detail the cases $n=1$ and $n=2$.

2023-08-14, **Constraints on primordial black holes in the mixed dark matter scenarios using the ratio $\rm (^3{He}+D)/H$**, Yupeng Yang et.al., [2308.07010v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07010v1)

 We derive the upper limit on the dark matter (DM) fraction in primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mixed DM scenarios. In this scenarios, a PBH can accrete weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) to form a ultracompact minihalo (UCMH) with a density profile of $\rho\_{\rm DM}(r)\sim r^{-9/4}$. The energy released from UCMHs due to dark matter annihilation has influence on the photodissociation of $^{4}{\rm He}$, producing the $^{3}{\rm He}$ and the D. By requiring that the ratio $\rm (^3{He}+D)/H$ caused by UCMHs does not exceed the measured value, we derive the upper limit on the dark matter fraction in PBHs. For the canonical value of DM thermally averaged annihilation cross section $\left<\sigma v\right>=3\times 10^{-26}\rm cm^{3}s^{-1}$, we find that the upper limit is $f\_{\rm PBH} < 0.35(0.75)$ for DM mass $m\_{\chi}=1(10)~\rm GeV$. Compared with other limits obtained by different astronomical measurements, although our limit is not the strongest, we provide a different way of constraining the cosmological abundance of PBHs.

 Analyzing the high-resolution CO-line survey of the Galactic plane with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope (FUGIN), we show that the star-forming complex G18.15-0.30+51 (G18) at radial velocity of 51 \kms is {a tight triple association of a giant molecular cloud (GMC), HII regions, and a supernova remnant (SNR).} The kinematical distance of G18 is determined to be $d=3.9\pm 0.2$ kpc for near solution for circular rotation, $12\pm 0.2$ kpc for far solution, or $d=6.1\pm 0.1$, if it is in the 3-kpc expanding ring. The HI-line absorption of radio continuum from the HII regions constrains the distance to $5.6 \lesssim d\_{\rm SNR}\le 7.6$ kpc. The $\Sigma-D$ (radio brightness-diameter) relation yields the distance to the SNR of $d\_{\rm SNR}=10.1^{+11.5}\_{-4.7}$ kpc, allowing for a minimum distance of 5.4 kpc. From these we uniquely determined the distance of G18 to be $6.07\pm 0.13$ kpc in the 3-kpc expanding ring with the SNR being physically associated. The molecular mass of the GMC is estimated to be $M\_{\rm mol}\sim 3\times 10^5 M\_\odot$. The ratio of Virial to luminous molecular masses is greater than unity in the central region and decreases outward to $\lesssim 0.2$ at the cloud edge, indicating that the central region is dynamic, while the entire cloud is stable. We discuss the origin of the G18 triple system and propose a sustainable GMC model with continuous star formation.

 Accurately quantifying the rates dM/dt at which massive stars lose mass is essential to any understanding of their evolution. All dM/dt estimates to date assume wind clumping factors; not allowing for clumping leads to overestimates of dM/dt and underestimates of lifetimes and masses when these stars explode as supernovae. Mid-IR spectroscopy suggested that the wind of the nearest Wolf-Rayet star, Gamma2 Vel, is resolved with a Full Width at 10 per cent intensity of 0.5 arcsec, or 171 AU at the 342 pc distance of the star. As the Zorro speckle imager on Gemini-South is capable of 0.02 arcsec resolution, we have used it to image Gamma2 Vel at two orbital phases (0.30 and 0.44) with two narrowband and two intermediate-band filters in an attempt to resolve its wind. Our observations demonstrate that the wind of Gamma2 Vel may be resolved as a 0.07 arcsec westward elongation through an 832 nm filter at orbital phase 0.3 . If confirmed, this is the smallest scale (24 AU) at which a WR star wind asymmetry has been directly imaged. Similar imaging at multiple phases is needed to determine if the asymmetry is due to stochastic wind clumping, co-rotating interaction regions or colliding-wind, cone-shaped shocks.

2023-08-14, **Late time HST UV and optical observations of AT~2018cow: extracting a cow from its background**, Anne Inkenhaag et.al., [2308.07381v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07381v1)

 The bright, blue, rapidly evolving AT2018cow is a well-studied peculiar extragalactic transient. Despite an abundance of multi-wavelength data, there still is no consensus on the nature of the event. We present our analysis of three epochs of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations spanning the period from 713-1474 days post burst, paying particular attention to uncertainties of the transient photometry introduced by the complex background in which AT2018cow resides. Photometric measurements show evident fading in the UV and more subtle but significant fading in the optical. During the last HST observation, the transient's optical/UV colours were still bluer than those of the substantial population of compact, young, star-forming regions in the host of AT2018cow, suggesting some continued transient contribution to the light. However, a compact source underlying the transient would substantially modify the resulting spectral energy distribution, depending on its contribution in the various bands. In particular, in the optical filters, the complex, diffuse background poses a problem for precise photometry. An underlying cluster is expected for a supernova occurring within a young stellar environment or a tidal-disruption event (TDE) within a dense older one. While many recent works have focused on the supernova interpretation, we note the substantial similarity in UV light-curve morphology between AT2018cow and several tidal disruption events around supermassive black holes. Assuming AT2018cow arises from a TDE-like event, we fit the late-time emission with a disc model and find $M\_{BH} = 10^{3.2{\pm}0.8}$ M$\_{\odot}$. Further observations are necessary to determine the late-time evolution of the transient and its immediate environment.

2023-08-14, **Very late-time spectroscopy of SN 2009ip: Constraints on the ongoing H$α$ emission**, Thallis Pessi et.al., [2308.07370v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07370v1)

 The peculiar supernova (SN) 2009ip is an ambiguous event that spurred many questions regarding its true origins. Here, we present very late-time spectroscopic and photometric observations of SN 2009ip, obtained 9 years (3274 days) after the 2012B outburst. We analyze the H$\alpha$ emission still present in the very late-time spectrum of SN 2009ip. We also obtain photometric measurements in the $r$, $g,$ and $i$ bands. We obtained observations of SN 2009ip on 2021 September 10 with the IMACS instrument at the 6.5 m Magellan Baade Telescope, located at the Las Campanas Observatory. SN 2009ip was detected in the $r$, $g,$ and $i$ bands, with an absolute magnitude in $r$ band of $\sim -8.66$~mag. We show that the source faded significantly since the last observations in these bands. We further show that the very late-time spectrum contains a persistent H$\alpha$ emission, although no other emission lines were detected. We measured a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $930 \pm 40 \ \textrm{km s}^{-1}$ and luminosity of $\sim 8.0 \times 10^{37} \ \textrm{erg s}^{-1}$ for the H$\alpha$ emission. The luminosity decreased relatively slowly in comparison to the last observations and its fading rate is very similar to other long-living interacting transients, such as SN 2005ip. Finally, we conclude that although these properties could be consistent with a non-regular core-collapse SN, they may also be explained through non-terminal explosion scenarios.

2023-08-14, **GHOST Commissioning Science Results II: a very metal-poor star witnessing the early Galactic assembly**, Federico Sestito et.al., [2308.07366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07366v1)

 This study focuses on Pristine$\\_180956.78$$-$$294759.8$ (hereafter P180956, [Fe/H] $=-1.95\pm0.02$), a star selected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS), and followed-up with the recently commissioned Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) at the Gemini South telescope. The GHOST spectrograph's high efficiency in the blue spectral region ($3700-4800$~\AA) enables the detection of elemental tracers of early supernovae (e.g. Al, Mn, Sr, Eu), which were not accessible in the previous analysis of P180956. The star exhibits chemical signatures resembling those found in ultra-faint dwarf systems, characterised by very low abundances of neutron-capture elements (Sr, Ba, Eu), which are uncommon among stars of comparable metallicity in the Milky Way. Our analysis suggests that P180956 bears the chemical imprints of a small number (2 or 4) of low-mass hypernovae ($\sim10-15\msun$), which are needed to reproduce the abundance pattern of the light-elements (e.g. [Si, Ti/Mg, Ca] $\sim0.6$), and one fast-rotating intermediate-mass supernova ($\sim300\kms$, $\sim80-120\msun$). Both types of supernovae explain the high [Sr/Ba] of P180956 ($\sim1.2$). The small pericentric ($\sim0.7\kpc$) and apocentric ($\sim13\kpc$) distances and its orbit confined to the plane ($\lesssim 2\kpc$), indicate that this star was likely accreted during the early Galactic assembly phase. Its chemo-dynamical properties suggest that P180956 formed in a system similar to an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy accreted either alone, as one of the low-mass building blocks of the proto-Galaxy, or as a satellite of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus. The combination of Gemini's large aperture with GHOST's high efficiency and broad spectral coverage makes this new spectrograph one of the leading instruments for near-field cosmology investigations.

2023-08-14, **A New Cosmological Model: Exploring the Evolution of the Universe and Unveiling Super-Accelerated Expansion**, Himanshu Chaudhary et.al., [2308.07354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07354v1)

 In this paper, we present a cosmological model designed to study the evolution of the universe based on a new parametrization of the deceleration parameter. The model considers a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe filled with radiation, dark matter (DM), and dark energy (DE). We derive the Friedmann equations and the energy conservation equation for the universe, accounting for separate conservation equations for radiation, DM, and DE. Our proposed deceleration parameter is given by a formula involving constants $H\_{0}$, $\Omega\_{r0}$, $\Omega\_{m0}$, $q\_{2}$, $q\_{1}$, $q\_{0}$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. which we subsequently fit to observational data. To assess the model's viability, we compare it with a diverse range of observational data, including cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background measurements. Employing the chi-square statistic and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we estimate the best-fit values for the free parameters and investigate the constraints imposed by observational data on the model. Our results indicate that our cosmological model provides an excellent fit to the observed data and exhibits a remarkable agreement with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm at higher redshifts. However, the most intriguing discovery lies in the model's prediction of a super-accelerated expansion in the distant future, in contrast to the de Sitter phase predicted by $\Lambda$CDM. This implies the presence of dark energy driving the universe's accelerated expansion. These findings suggest that our proposed cosmological model offers a compelling alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, shedding new light on the nature of dark energy and the future fate of the cosmos.

2023-08-14, **An Extensive $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ Study of the Offset and Host Light Distributions of Type I Superluminous Supernovae**, Brian Hsu et.al., [2308.07271v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07271v1)

 We present an extensive $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ ($\textit{HST}$) rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging study of the locations of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) within their host galaxies. The sample includes 65 SLSNe with detected host galaxies in the redshift range $z\approx 0.05-2$. Using precise astrometric matching with SN images, we determine the distributions of physical and host-normalized offsets relative to the host centers, as well as the fractional flux distribution relative to the underlying UV light distribution. We find that the host-normalized offsets of SLSNe roughly track an exponential disk profile, but exhibit an overabundance of sources with large offsets of $1.5-4$ times their host half-light radius. The SLSNe normalized offsets are systematically larger than those of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), and even Type Ib/c and II SNe. Furthermore, we find that about 40\% of all SLSNe occur in the dimmest regions of their host galaxies (fractional flux of 0), in stark contrast to LGRBs and Type Ib/c and II SNe. We do not detect any significant trends in the locations of SLSNe as a function of redshift, or as a function of explosion and magnetar engine parameters inferred from modeling of their optical lights curves. The significant difference in SLSN locations compared to LGRBs (and normal core-collapse SNe) suggests that at least some of their progenitors follow a different evolutionary path. We speculate that SLSNe arise from massive runaway stars from disrupted binary systems, with velocities of $\sim 10^2$ km s$^{-1}$.

2023-08-14, **Lightcurve and spectral modelling of the Type IIb SN 2020acat. Evidence for a strong Ni bubble effect on the diffusion time**, Mattias Ergon et.al., [2308.07158v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07158v1)

 We use the light curve and spectral synthesis code JEKYLL to calculate a set of macroscopically mixed Type IIb supernova (SN) models, which are compared to both previously published and new late-phase observations of SN 2020acat. The models differ in the initial mass, the radial mixing and expansion of the radioactive material, and the properties of the hydrogen envelope. The best match to the photospheric and nebular spectra and lightcurves of SN 2020acat is found for a model with an initial mass of 17 solar masses, strong radial mixing and expansion of the radioactive material, and a 0.1 solar mass hydrogen envelope with a low hydrogen mass-fraction of 0.27. The most interesting result is that strong expansion of the clumps containing radioactive material seems to be required to fit the observations of SN 2020acat both in the diffusion phase and the nebular phase. These "Ni bubbles" are expected to expand due to heating from radioactive decays, but the degree of expansion is poorly constrained. Without strong expansion there is a tension between the diffusion phase and the subsequent evolution, and models that fit the nebular phase produce a diffusion peak that is too broad. The diffusion phase lightcurve is sensitive to the expansion of the "Ni bubbles", as the resulting Swiss-cheese-like geometry decreases the effective opacity and therefore the diffusion time. This effect has not been taken into account in previous lightcurve modelling of stripped-envelope SNe, which may lead to a systematic underestimate of their ejecta masses. It should be emphasized, though, that JEKYLL is limited to a geometry that is spherically symmetric on average, and large-scale asymmetries may also play a role. The relatively high initial mass found for the progenitor of SN 2020acat places it at the upper end of the mass distribution of Type IIb SN progenitors, and a single star origin can not be excluded.

2023-08-14, **Late-time Cosmology without Dark Sector but with Closed String Massless Sector**, Hocheol Lee et.al., [2308.07149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07149v1)

 We propose to solve the dark energy problem by postulating the massless sector of closed strings. This sector constitutes the gravitational multiplet of string theory and, when applied to four-dimensional cosmology, predicts that the expansion of an open Universe defined in string frame is readily accelerating. We confront the prediction with the late-time cosmological data of Type Ia supernovae and quasar absorption spectrum, which probe the evolutions of the Hubble parameter and possibly the fine-structure constant. We report that the observations are in admirable agreement with the prediction without any dark sector. We estimate the Hubble constant, $H\_{0}\simeq 71.2\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.

2023-08-14, **A Model-independent Method to Determine $H_0$ using Time-Delay Lensing, Quasars and Type Ia Supernova**, Xiaolei Li et.al., [2308.06951v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06951v1)

 Absolute distances from strong lensing can anchor Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) at cosmological distances giving a model-independent inference of the Hubble constant ($H\_0$). Future observations could provide strong lensing time delay distances with source redshifts up to $z\,\simeq\,4$, which are much higher than the maximum redshift of SNe Ia observed so far. Quasars are also observed at high redshifts and can be potentially used as standard candles based on a linear relation between the log of the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray luminosities. In order to make full use of time delay distances measured at higher redshifts, we use quasars as a complementary cosmic probe to measure cosmological distances at redshifts beyond those of SNe Ia and provide a model-independent method to determine the Hubble constant. In this work, we demonstrate a model-independent, joint constraint of SNe Ia, quasars, and time-delay distances. We first generate mock datasets of SNe Ia, quasar, and time-delay distances based on a fiducial cosmological model. Then, we calibrate quasar parameters model independently using Gaussian process (GP) regression with mock SNe Ia data. Finally, we determine the value of $H\_0$ model-independently using GP regression from mock quasars and time-delay distances from strong lensing systems. As a comparison, we also show the $H\_0$ results obtained from mock SNe Ia in combination with time delay lensing systems whose redshifts overlap with SNe Ia. Our results show that quasars at higher redshifts show great potential to extend the redshift coverage of SNe Ia and thus enables the full use of strong lens time-delay distance measurements from ongoing cosmic surveys and improve the accuracy of the estimation of $H\_0$ from $2.1\%$ to $1.3\%$.
