2024-04-30, **The Width of an Electron-Capture Neutrino Wave Packet**, B. J. P. Jones et.al., [2404.19746v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19746v1)

 We expand on the methodology outlined in previous work that predicted the width of an antineutrino wave packet emerging from a beta-decaying nucleus, to the case of a neutrino from electron capture decay. Based on this result, we also respond to a recent Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions Experiment (BeEST) paper which utilizes this previous work in forming their measurement of the neutrino wave packet width. According to our interpretation, the direct limit on the neutrino wave packet width from electron capture decay ($e^- + \mathrm{^{7}Be}\rightarrow\mathrm{^{7}Li+\nu\_e}$) using the BeEST analysis should map to $\sigma\_{\nu,x}>6.2\,\mathrm{pm}$ while our theoretical prediction is $\sigma\_{\nu,x}\sim2.7\,\mathrm{nm}$.

2024-04-30, **Investigating the correlations between IceCube high-energy neutrinos and Fermi-LAT $γ$-ray observations. II**, Ming-Xuan Lu et.al., [2404.19730v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19730v1)

 Given that gamma rays with energies larger than TeV are severely absorbed by background radiation fields, for many extragalactic sources, the GeV-TeV gamma-ray observations are the messengers that are closest in energy to the TeV-PeV neutrinos observed by IceCube. Investigating whether there is a correlation between the gamma-ray and neutrino observations can help us identify high-energy neutrino sources and determine which sources are the main contributors to the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux of IceCube. In previous work, we have already studied the possible gamma-neutrino correlations by analyzing 10 years of IceCube muon-track data. In this work, we further investigate such correlations by employing the IceCube p-value sky map of the scan for point sources. We examine the spatial associations of hotspots in the neutrino sky map with various gamma-ray source samples: the third Fermi-LAT catalog of high-energy sources (3FHL), LAT 14-year source catalog (4FGL), the fourth catalog of active galactic nuclei (4LAC) and subsets of these samples. Among all the samples, the 3FHL sample shows a possible correlation with the neutrino hotspots, with a pre-trial p-value of $1.1\times10^{-4}$ ($\sim 3.9\,\sigma$). However, this is found to be caused by three already known neutrino sources/source candidates: NGC 1068, TXS 0506+056, and PKS 1424+240. In order to validate our analysis procedure and to test the robustness of the previously claimed correlation between the 5BZCAT blazars and neutrino hotspots, we also consider 5BZCAT blazars in our correlation study. We find that the way in which mock sources are generated in the simulation used to derive the chance coincidence probability may have a large impact on the claimed correlation.

2024-04-30, **Recent Neutrino Parameters Impact on the Effective Majorana Neutrino Mass in 0$νββ$ Decay**, Dongming Mei et.al., [2404.19624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19624v1)

 We investigate how recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters and the sum of neutrino masses influence the sensitivity of neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. Incorporating the latest cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and laboratory measurements on oscillations, we determine the sum of neutrino masses for both the normal hierarchy (NH) and the inverted hierarchy (IH). Our analysis reveals a narrow range for the sum of neutrino masses, approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for IH. Utilizing these constraints, we calculate the effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH scenarios, establishing the corresponding allowed regions. Importantly, we find that the minimum neutrino mass is non-zero, as constrained by the current oscillation parameters. Additionally, we estimate the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay using these effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH. Our results suggest that upcoming ton-scale experiments will comprehensively explore the IH scenario, while 100-ton-scale experiments will effectively probe the parameter space for the NH scenario, provided the background index can achieve 1 event/kton-year in the region of interest.

2024-04-30, **Prospects for weighing neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using joint observations of gravitational waves and $γ$-ray bursts**, Lu Feng et.al., [2404.19530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19530v1)

 In this work, we explore the capability of future gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations to constrain the total neutrino mass in some typical interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We examine the combined potential of the third-generation ground-based GW detector network and a short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector similar to the THESEUS telescope for cosmological analysis. Our findings suggest that future GW standard siren observations could modestly refine the upper limit on the total neutrino mass, enhancing it by $5\%$ to $10\%$ over the existing limit given by the CMB+BAO+SN data. Additionally, the future observations are expected to significantly improve the constraints on $\Omega\_{\rm m}$ and $H\_0$. Moreover, the measurements could enhance the precision of the coupling strength $\beta$ by $23\%$ to $42\%$.

2024-04-30, **DARWIN/XLZD: a future xenon observatory for dark matter and other rare interactions**, Laura Baudis et.al., [2404.19524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19524v1)

 The DARWIN/XLZD experiment is a next-generation dark matter detector with a multi-ten-ton liquid xenon time projection chamber at its core. Its principal goal will be to explore the experimentally accessible parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in a wide mass-range, until interactions of astrophysical neutrinos will become an irreducible background. The prompt scintillation light and the charge signals induced by particle interactions in the liquid xenon target will be observed by VUV-sensitive, ultra-low background photosensors. Besides its excellent sensitivity to WIMPs with masses above $\sim$5\,GeV, such a detector with its large mass, low-energy threshold and ultra-low background level will also be sensitive to other rare interactions, and in particular also to bosonic dark matter candidates with masses at the keV-scale. We present the detector concept, discuss the main sources of backgrounds, the technological challenges and some of the ongoing detector design and R&D efforts, as well as the large-scale demonstrators. We end by discussing the sensitivity to particle dark matter interactions.

2024-04-30, **Interplay between Vector-like Lepton and Seesaw Mechanism:Oblique Corrections**, Shuyang Han et.al., [2404.19502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19502v1)

 The non-vanishing neutrino mass strongly hints the existence of right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), singlets of the standard model (SM). However, they are highly decoupled from the SM and difficult to probe. In this work, we consider the Majorana RHNs from the type-I seesaw mechanism may well mix with the heavy neutral lepton dwelling in certain vector-like lepton (VLL), thus acquiring a sizable electroweak charge. Such a simple scenario yields many interesting consequences, and the imprint on oblique corrections, well expected from the mass splitting between components of VLL by virtue of VLL-RHN mixing, is our focus here. We analytically calculate the Peskin-Takeuchi parameters S, T and U with full details, carefully treating the Majorana loop to obtain the self consistent expressions free of divergence. Then, we constrain on the VLL-RHN system which only gives a sizable $T$ parameter using the PDG-2021 data and CDF-II data, separately, by imposing $T\lesssim{\cal O}(0.1)$. It is found that for the RHN and VLL below the TeV scale, with a properly large mixing, stands in the frontier of the electroweak precision test such as W-boson mass.

2024-04-30, **AGN constraints on neutrino-dark matter scattering**, James M. Cline et.al., [2404.19471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19471v1)

 The IceCube collaboration has identified neutrinos of energy $\sim 10-100$ TeV from the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the active galaxy NGC 1068, which must have traveled through a dense dark matter spike surrounding the supermassive black holes that power the galactic nuclei. We use this to set new constraints on dark matter-neutrino scattering, and interpret the results in terms of a dark photon that couples to baryon minus lepton number.

2024-04-30, **Neutrinos in Cosmology**, Eleonora Di Valentino et.al., [2404.19322v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19322v1)

 Neutrinos are the least known particle in the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. They play a crucial role in cosmology, governing the universe's evolution and shaping the large-scale structures we observe today. In this chapter, we review crucial topics in neutrino cosmology, such as the neutrino decoupling process in the very early universe. We shall also revisit the current constraints on the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom and the departures from its standard expectation of 3. Neutrino masses represent the very first departure from the Standard Model of elementary particle physics and may imply the existence of new unexplored mass generation mechanisms. Cosmology provides the tightest bound on the sum of neutrino masses, and we shall carefully present the nature of these constraints, both on the total mass of the neutrinos and on their precise spectrum. The ordering of the neutrino masses plays a major role in the design of future neutrino mass searches from laboratory experiments, such as neutrinoless double beta decay probes. Finally, we shall also present the futuristic perspectives for an eventual direct detection of cosmic, relic neutrinos.

2024-04-30, **High-energy neutrino signals from supernova explosions: a new window into dark photon parameter space**, Vsevolod Syvolap et.al., [2404.19191v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19191v1)

 Dark photons, hypothetical feebly interacting massive vector bosons, appear in many extensions of the Standard Model. This study investigates their production and subsequent decay during supernova explosions. We demonstrate that the decay of dark photons, with masses ranging from 200 to 400 MeV, can lead to the emission of neutrinos with energies surpassing those emitted by supernovae. These neutrinos therefore serve as a distinct signal of new physics, allowing for the exploration of previously uncharted regions of the dark photon parameter space and complementing both accelerator-based searches and other astrophysical constraints. The signal is largely unaffected by the specifics of the supernova's temperature and density radial profiles outside the SN core, rendering the prediction both robust and model-independent. Our results indicate that searching for high-energy neutrinos accompanying supernova explosions provides a novel approach to probe physics beyond the Standard Model, including dark photons, heavy neutral leptons, and other feebly interacting particles with masses in the hundreds of MeV range.

2024-04-29, **Torsion-induced axions in string theory, quantum gravity and the cosmological tensions**, Nick E. Mavromatos et.al., [2404.18741v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18741v1)

 We discuss the role of torsion in string theory on inducing pseudoscalar degrees of freedom (axions), which in turn couple to (gravitational) Chern-Simons (CS) anomalous terms. Such interactions can induce inflation, of running vacuum type, not requiring external inflaton fields, through condensation of the anomalous terms as a consequence of primordial chiral gravitational-wave (GW) tensor perturbations in a weak-quantum gravity setting. The presence of an UV cutoff for the GW quantum graviton modes opens up the system, leading to a dissipative behaviour realised via the presence of non trivial imaginary parts of the gravitational CS terms. The naive estimate of the life time of inflation based on such imaginary parts, which afflict the pertinent GW Hamiltonian, is quite consistent with the estimates of the duration of inflation based on an analysis of the condensate-induced linear-axion-potential by means of dynamical systems. Such quantum-gravity effects can also contribute positively to the alleviation of cosmological tensions if they survive today. In the talk we discuss the conditions under which such a result may be achieved. We also discuss the potential role of other axions in string theory, coming from compactification, in inducing enhanced densities of primordial black holes during RVM inflation, thereby contributing to significantly increased percentages of these black holes that can play the role of dark matter components. Moreover, under certain circumstances, that we shall discuss in some detail, it is also possible that the initially massless torsion-induced axions can acquire a non-trivial mass during the radiation era, thereby providing additional dark matter components in the Universe. With regards to this aspect, we also emphasise the role of massive right-handed neutrinos, provided that such excitations exist in the relevant spectra.

2024-04-29, **Dynamical ejecta from binary neutron star mergers: Impact of residual eccentricity and equation of state implementation**, Francois Foucart et.al., [2404.18674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18674v1)

 Predicting the properties of the matter ejected during and after a neutron star merger is crucial to our ability to use electromagnetic observations of these mergers to constrain the masses of the neutron stars, the equation of state of dense matter, and the role of neutron star mergers in the enrichment of the Universe in heavy elements. Our ability to reliably provide such predictions is however limited by a broad range of factors, including the finite resolution of numerical simulations, their treatment of magnetic fields, neutrinos, and neutrino-matter interactions, and the approximate modeling of the equation of state of dense matter. In this manuscript, we study specifically the role that a small residual eccentricity and different implementations of the same equation of state have on the matter ejected during the merger of a $1.3M\_\odot-1.4M\_\odot$ binary neutron star system. We find that a residual eccentricity $e\sim 0.01$, as measured $\sim 4-6$ orbits before merger, causes $O(25\%-30\%)$ changes in the amount of ejected mass, mainly due to changes in the amount of matter ejected as a result of core bounces during merger. We note that $O(1\%)$ residual eccentricities have regularly been used in binary neutron star merger simulations as proxy for circular binaries, potentially creating an additional source of error in predictions for the mass of the dynamical ejecta.

2024-04-30, **The Local Dark Matter Kinematic Substructure Based on LAMOST K Giants**, Hai Zhu et.al., [2404.19655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19655v1)

 Numerical simulations indicate that correlations exist between the velocity distributions of stars and dark matter (DM). We study the local DM velocity distribution based on these correlations. We select K giants from LAMOST DR8 cross-matched with Gaia DR3, which has robust measurements of three-dimensional velocity and metallicity, and separate them into the disk, halo substructure and main halo components in the chemo-dynamical space utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model. The substructure component is highly radially anisotropic, and possibly related to the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) merger event, while the halo component is isotropic and accreted from the earliest mergers following the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution (Standard Halo Model, SHM). We find that the GES-like substructure contributes $\sim85\%$ of the local non-disk stars in the Solar neighbourhood, which is nearly invariant when applying different volume cuts or additional angular momentum constraints. Utilizing the metallicity-stellar-mass relation and the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation, we find that $\sim25\_{-15}^{+24}\%$ of local DM is in the kinematic substructure. Combined with the stellar distributions of non-disk components, we compute the velocity distribution of local DM. The modified heliocentric velocity distribution of local DM shifts to a lower speed and has a sharper peak compared to the SHM, which yields updated detection limits for the DM direct detection experiments. Our work confirms that the local DM velocity distribution deviates from the SHM, and needs to be properly accounted in the DM detection experiments.

2024-04-30, **NMSSM Explanation for Excesses in the Search for Neutralinos and Charginos and a 95 GeV Higgs Boson**, Ulrich Ellwanger et.al., [2404.19338v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19338v1)

 The observed excesses in the search for neutralinos and charginos by ATLAS and CMS can be fitted simultaneously in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) assuming a light higgsino mass, of magnitude less than about 250 GeV, and a compressed higgsino dominated neutralino and chargino spectrum, with $5-10\%$ mass splittings. However, light higgsinos as dark matter would have far too large direct detection cross sections. We consider the next-to-MSSM (NMSSM) with an additional singlino-like lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) a few GeV below the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). Sparticles prefer to decay first into the NLSP and remnants from the final decay into the LSP are too soft to contribute to the observed signals. Co-annihilation in the higgsino-sector can generate a relic density in the WMAP/Planck window. The singlino-like LSP has automatically a direct detection cross section below present and future sensitivities: a direct detection signal in the near future would exclude this scenario. The singlet-like Higgs scalar of the NMSSM can have a mass around 95 GeV and signal cross sections in the $b\bar{b}$ channel at LEP and in the $\gamma\gamma$ channel at the LHC compatible with the respective observations.

2024-04-29, **Modelling the Track of the GD-1 Stellar Stream Inside a Host with a Fermionic Dark Matter Core-Halo Distribution**, Martín F. Mestre et.al., [2404.19102v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19102v1)

 Traditional studies on stellar streams typically involve phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM halos or ad hoc dark matter (DM) profiles with different degrees of triaxiality, which preclude to gain insights into the nature and mass of the DM particles. Recently, a Maximum Entropy Principle of halo formation has been applied to provide a DM halo model which incorporates the fermionic (quantum) nature of the particles, while leading to DM profiles which depend on the fermion mass. Such profiles develop a more general dense core - diluted halo morphology able to explain the Galactic rotation curve, while the degenerate fermion core can mimic the central massive black hole (BH). We attempt to model the GD-1 stellar stream using a spherical core-halo DM distribution for the host, which, at the same time, explains the dynamics of the S-cluster stars through its degenerate fermion-core with no central BH. We used two optimization algorithms in order to fit both the initial conditions of the stream orbit and the fermionic model. The stream observables are 5D phase-space data from the Gaia DR2 survey. We were able to find good fits for both the GD-1 stream and the S-stars for a family of fermionic core-halo profiles parameterized by the fermion mass. This work provides evidence that the fermionic profile is a reliable model for both the massive central object and the DM of the Galaxy. Remarkably, this model predicts a total MW mass of $2.3\times 10^{11}M\_{\odot}$ which is in agreement with recent mass estimates obtained from Gaia DR3 rotation curves (Gaia RC). In summary, with one single fermionic model for the DM distribution of the MW, we obtain a good fit in three totally different distance scales of the Galaxy: $\sim 10^{-6}$ kpc (central, S-stars), $\sim14$ kpc (mid, GD-1) and $\sim 30$ kpc (boundary, Gaia RC mass estimate).

2024-04-29, **Capture of field stars by dark substructures**, Jorge Peñarrubia et.al., [2404.19069v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19069v1)

 We use analytical and $N$-body methods to study the capture of field stars by gravitating substructures moving across a galactic environment. We find that the majority of captured stars move on temporarily-bound orbits that escape from the substructure potential after a few orbital revolutions. In numerical experiments where a substructure model is immersed in a galaxy on a circular orbit, we also find particles that remain bound to the substructure potential for indefinitely-long times. This population is absent from substructure models initially placed outside the galaxy on an eccentric orbit. We show that gravitational capture is most efficient in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) on account of their low velocity dispersions and high stellar phase-space densities. In these galaxies `dark' sub-subhaloes which do not experience in-situ star formation may capture field stars and become visible as stellar overdensities with unusual properties: (i) they would have a large size for their luminosity, (ii) contain stellar populations indistinguishable from the host galaxy, and (iii) exhibit dark matter (DM)-dominated mass-to-light ratios. We discuss the nature of several `anomalous' stellar systems reported as star clusters in the Fornax and Eridanus II dSphs which exhibit some of these characteristics. A large population of DM sub-subhaloes with a mass function $d N/d M\_\bullet\sim M\_\bullet^{-\alpha}$ generates stellar substructures with a luminosity function, $d N/d M\_\star\sim M\_\star^{-\beta}$, where $\beta=(2\alpha+1)/3=1.6$ for $\alpha=1.9$. Detecting and characterizing these objects in dSphs would provide unprecedented constraints on the particle mass and cross section of a large range of DM particle candidates.

2024-04-29, **Coscattering in the Extended Singlet-Scalar Higgs Portal**, Bastián Díaz Sáez et.al., [2404.19057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19057v1)

 We study the coscattering mechanism in a simple Higgs portal which add two real singlet scalars to the Standard Model. In this scenario, the lighter scalar is stabilized by a single $\mathcal{Z}\_2$ symmetry and acts as the dark matter relic, whose freeze-out is driven by conversion processes. The heavier scalar becomes an unstable state which participate actively in the coscattering. We find viable parameter regions fulfilling the measured relic abundance, while evading direct detection and big-bang nucleosynthesis bounds. In addition, we discuss collider prospects for the heavier scalar as a long-lived particle at present and future detectors.

2024-04-29, **Report from the Workshop on Xenon Detector $0νββ$ Searches: Steps Towards the Kilotonne Scale**, A. Anker et.al., [2404.19050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19050v1)

 These proceedings summarize the program and discussions of the ``Workshop on Xenon Detector $0\nu\beta\beta$ Searches: Steps Towards the Kilotonne Scale'' held on October 25-27 2023 at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. This workshop brought together experts from the communities of neutrinoless double-beta decay and dark matter detection, to discuss paths forward for the realization of monolithic experiments with xenon approaching the kilotonne scale.

2024-04-29, **Axion Searches Go Deep Underground**, Carlo Broggini et.al., [2404.18993v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18993v1)

 We propose to investigate the time modulation of radioisotope decays deep underground as a method to explore axion dark matter. In this work, we focus on the $\alpha$-decay of heavy isotopes and develop a theoretical description for the $\theta$-dependence of $\alpha$-decay half-lives, which enables us to predict the time variation of $\alpha$-radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. To probe this scenario, we have recently constructed and installed a setup deep underground at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the $\alpha$-decay of Americium-241. This prototype experiment, named RadioAxion-$\alpha$, will allow us to explore a broad range of oscillation's periods, from a few micro-seconds up to one year, thus providing competitive limits on the axion decay constant across 13 orders of magnitude in the axion mass, ranging from $10^{-9}$ eV to $10^{-20}$ eV after one month of data collection, and down to $10^{-22}$ eV after three years.

2024-04-29, **A dusty proto-cluster surrounding the binary galaxy HerBS-70 at $z = 2.3$**, Tom J. L. C. Bakx et.al., [2404.18991v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18991v1)

 We report on deep SCUBA-2 observations at 850$\mu$m and NOEMA spectroscopic measurements at 2 mm of the environment surrounding the luminous, massive ($M\_{*} \approx 2 \times 10^{11}$ M$\_{\odot}$) Herschel-selected source HerBS-70. This source was revealed by previous NOEMA observations to be a binary system of dusty star-forming galaxies at $z= 2.3$, with the East component (HerBS-70E) hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). The SCUBA-2 observations detected, in addition to the binary system, twenty-one sources at $> 3.5 \sigma$ over an area of $\sim 25$ square comoving Mpc with a sensitivity of $\sigma\_{850} = 0.75$ mJy. The surface density of continuum sources around HerBS-70 is three times higher than for field galaxies. The NOEMA spectroscopic measurements confirm the protocluster membership of three of the nine brightest sources through their CO(4 - 3) line emission, yielding a volume density 36 times higher than for field galaxies. All five confirmed sub-mm galaxies in the HerBS-70 system have relatively short gas depletion times ($80 - 500$ Myr), indicating the onset of quenching for this protocluster core due to the depletion of gas. The dark matter halo mass of the HerBS-70 system is estimated around $5 \times{} 10^{13}$ M$\_{\odot}$, with a projected current-day mass of $10^{15}$ M$\_{\odot}$, similar to the local Virgo and Coma clusters. These observations support the claim that DSFGs, in particular the ones with observed multiplicity, can trace cosmic overdensities.

2024-04-29, **Evolving wormhole geometry from dark matter energy density**, Farook Rahaman et.al., [2404.18964v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18964v1)

 We analyze traversable wormholes defined by the dynamic line elements that asymptotically approaches Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. This dynamical wormholes is supported by the galactic dark matter as well as perfect isotropic fluid. We will discuss several evolving Lorentzian wormholes comprising with different perfect isotropic fluids in addition to various scale factors. We will speculate the various significance, features and throat energy conditions for these evolving traversable Lorentzian wormholes.

2024-04-29, **Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions**, Adria Gomez-Valent et.al., [2404.18845v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18845v1)

 The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy (associated to the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, collectively denoted $X$. This was indeed the old proposal from 2006, (cf. Ref.[41]) called the `$\Lambda$XCDM model', which was primordially designed to explain the cosmic coincidence problem. We now find that it can also have far reaching consequences on the current cosmological tensions on $H\_0$ and the growth of large scale structure (LSS). The $\Lambda$XCDM may involve both a phantom-like component $X$ and a constant cosmological term $\Lambda$ (positive or negative) or even a running one, $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. In the current work, we deal with a simplified version of the model and exploit the possibility that $X$ behaves as `phantom matter' (PM). The latter appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, it satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the tensions virtually disappear in this stringy RVM scenario characterized by axionic dark matter. The value of $H\_0$ emerging from our analysis proves compatible with SH0ES to within less than $0.25\sigma$ and the LSS growth tension is nonexistent. The statistical information criteria point to very strong evidence in favor of the PM solution.

2024-04-29, **Classical Casimir pressure in the presence of axion dark matter**, Philippe Brax et.al., [2404.18710v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18710v1)

 We study the effects of an oscillating axion field on the pressure between two metallic plates. We consider the situation where a magnetic field parallel to the plates is present and show that the electric field induced by the coupling of the axion to photons leads to resonances. When the boundary plates are perfect conductors, the resonances are infinitely thin whilst they are broadened when the conductivity of the boundary plates is taken into account. The resonances take place at the tower of distances close to dn = (2n+1){\pi}/m where m is the axion mass and have a finite width and height depending on the conductivity. The resulting resonant pressure on the plate depends on the induced polarisation at the surface of the plates. We investigate the reach of future Casimir experiments in terms of the axion mass and the conductivity of the boundary plates. We find that for large enough conductivities, the axion-induced pressure could be larger than the quantum Casimir effect between the plates.

2024-04-29, **Gravitational wave detection of DFSZ axion models**, Aidi Yang et.al., [2404.18703v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18703v1)

 As a promising dark matter candidate, the axion particle can naturally solve the strong CP problem of the standard model through the U(1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking process. However, detecting this high-energy process poses a significant challenge for colliders. We precisely calculate the phase transition gravitational wave signals of this symmetry-breaking process in the popular DFSZ axion model. By comparing the signals with the expected sensitivity of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, we demonstrate that Cosmic Explorer could detect this process with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 8 for the benchmark points. Furthermore, by performing Fisher analysis, we find that if signals are observed, the bubble wall velocity will be the first phase transition parameter to be determined. The future gravitational wave detectors are expected to provide a new approach to exploring concrete axion models.

2024-04-29, **Exploring the evolution of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy with SPH simulations: I. Stellar feedback**, Roberto Hazenfratz et.al., [2404.18701v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18701v1)

 A fundamental question regarding the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is the identification of the key physical mechanisms responsible for gas depletion. Here, we focus on the study of stellar feedback in isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, by performing numerical simulations using a modified version of the SPH code GADGET-3. The Milky Way satellite Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group was considered as our default model dwarf galaxy. The parameter space for the stellar feedback models was explored to match observational constraints of Leo II, such as residual gas mass, total mass within the tidal radius, star formation history, final stellar mass, stellar ages and metallicity. Additionally, we examined the impact of the binary fraction of stars, initial mass function, dark matter halo mass and initial gas reservoir. Many simulations revealed recent star formation quenching due to stellar feedback. In general, the gas depletion, expected star formation history, total mass of stars and total mass within the tidal radius were adequately reproduced in the simulations when compared to observational estimates. However, there were discrepancies in the distribution of stellar ages and metallicities, which suggested that the cosmic gas infall would play a more complex role in our dwarf spheroidal galaxy than captured by a monolithic infall scenario. Our results suggest that currently quenched dwarf galaxies may not necessarily need to evolve within clusters or groups, and that stellar feedback alone could be a sufficient factor in shaping at least some of these galaxies as we observe them today.

2024-04-29, **Absolute light yield measurement of NaI:Tl crystals for dark matter search**, Nguyen Thanh Luan et.al., [2404.18551v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18551v1)

 The NaI:Tl crystals were early investigated and used for wide application fields due to high light yield and crystal growth advantages. So far, the absolute light yields of NaI:Tl crystal have typically been known to be 40 ph/keV. However, it varies widely, far from the theoretical estimation. Since the high light yield and better sensitivity of NaI:Tl crystal is important for low mass dark matter search. Therefore, it is necessary to use high light NaI:Tl crystal, and absolute light yield should be measured with accuracy. In this work, we use the single photoelectron technique for measuring the absolute light yield of 35 NaI:Tl crystals with various sizes from different vendors. There are several high-quality crystals from the COSINE-100 experiment and commercial companies in these crystals. The theoretical estimation and GEANT4 optical simulation have been studied to investigate the PMT optics. Results show the essential role of this correction in avoiding overrated light yield values. The SPE technique using different PMT was compared to the photodiode and avalanche photodiode methods. A 10% systematic error was obtained. Our results show the excellent absolute light yield of NaI:Tl, at 59.4 +- 5.9 ph/keV, while the theoretical predicted light yield is around 70 ph/keV. The evaluation with NaI:Tl crystals in the COSINE-100 experiment has been performed. The six crystals in the COSINE-100 experiment have a high light yield. Based on our results, the light loss of encapsulation needs to be improved, especially for the big-size crystals.

 Experiments aimed at direct searches for WIMP dark matter require highly effective reduction of backgrounds and control of any residual radioactive contamination. In particular, neutrons interacting with atomic nuclei represent an important class of backgrounds due to the expected similarity of a WIMP-nucleon interaction, so that such experiments often feature a dedicated neutron detector surrounding the active target volume. In the context of the development of DarkSide-20k detector at INFN Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), several R&D projects were conceived and developed for the creation of a new hybrid material rich in both hydrogen and gadolinium nuclei to be employed as an essential element of the neutron detector. Thanks to its very high cross-section for neutron capture, gadolinium is one of the most widely used elements in neutron detectors, while the hydrogen-rich material is instrumental in efficiently moderating the neutrons. In this paper results from one of the R&Ds are presented. In this effort the new hybrid material was obtained as a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix, loaded with gadolinium oxide in the form of nanoparticles. We describe its realization, including all phases of design, purification, construction, characterization, and determination of mechanical properties of the new material.

 The cavity haloscope is among the most widely adopted experimental platforms designed to detect dark matter axions with its principle relying on the conversion of axions into microwave photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA), known for its quantum-limited noise characteristics, has been incorporated in the detection system to capture the weakly interacting axion signals. However, the performance of the JPA can be influenced by its environment, leading to potential unreliability of a predefined parameter set obtained in a specific laboratory setting. Furthermore, conducting a broadband search requires consecutive characterization of the amplifier across different tuning frequencies. To ensure more reliable measurements, we utilize the Nelder-Mead technique as a numerical search method to dynamically determine the optimal operating conditions. This heuristic search algorithm explores the multidimensional parameter space of the JPA, optimizing critical characteristics such as gain and noise temperature to maximize signal-to-noise ratios for a given experimental setup. Our study presents a comprehensive analysis of the properties of a flux-driven JPA to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. This approach contributes to ongoing efforts in axion dark matter research by offering an efficient method to enhance axion detection sensitivity through the optimized utilization of JPAs.

2024-04-30, **Optical Spectroscopy of Type Ia Supernovae by the Carnegie Supernova Projects I and II**, N. Morrell et.al., [2404.19208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19208v1)

 We present the second and final release of optical spectroscopy of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained during the first and second phases of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I and CSP-II). The newly released data consist of 148 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed in the course of the CSP-I, and 234 spectra of 127 SNe Ia obtained during the CSP-II. We also present 216 optical spectra of 46 historical SNe Ia, including 53 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed by the Cal\'an/Tololo Supernova Survey. We combine these observations with previously published CSP data and publicly-available spectra to compile a large sample of measurements of spectroscopic parameters at maximum light, consisting of pseudo-equivalent widths and expansion velocities of selected features, for 232 CSP and historical SNe Ia (including more than 1000 spectra). Finally, we review some of the strongest correlations between spectroscopic and photometric properties of SNe Ia. Specifically, we define two samples: one consisting of SNe Ia discovered by targeted searches (most of them CSP-I objects) and the other composed of SNe Ia discovered by untargeted searches, which includes most of the CSP-II objects. The analysed correlations are similar for both samples. We find a larger incidence of SNe Ia belonging to the Cool (CL)and Broad Line (BL) Branch subtypes among the events discovered by targeted searches, Shallow Silicon (SS) SNe Ia are present with similar frequencies in both samples, while Core Normal (CN) SNe Ia are more frequent in untargeted searches.

2024-04-29, **On the Pair-Instability Supernova origin of J1010+2358**, Ása Skúladóttir et.al., [2404.19086v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19086v1)

 The first (Pop III) stars formed only out of H and He and were likely more massive than present-day stars. Massive Pop III stars in the range 140-260 M$\_\odot$ are predicted to end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), enriching the environment with a unique abundance pattern, with high ratios of odd to even elements. Recently, the most promising candidate for a pure descendant of a zero-metallicity massive PISN (260 M$\_{\odot}$) was discovered by the LAMOST survey, the star J1010+2358. However, the key elements to verify the high PISN contribution, C and Al, were missing from the analysis. To rectify this, we obtained and analyzed a high-resolution VLT/UVES spectrum, correcting for 3D and/or non-LTE effects. Our measurements of both C and Al give much higher values (~1 dex) than expected from a 260 M$\_{\odot}$ PISN. Furthermore, we find significant discrepancies with the previous analysis, and therefore a much less pronounced odd-even effect. Thus, we show that J1010+2358 cannot be a pure descendant of a 260 M$\_{\odot}$ PISN. Instead, we find that the best fit model consists of a 13 M$\_{\odot}$ Pop II core-collapse supernova combined with a Pop III supernova. Alternative, less favoured solutions $(\chi^2/\chi^2\_{\rm best}\approx2.3)$ include a 50% contribution from a 260 M$\_{\odot}$ PISN, or a 40% contribution from a Pop III type Ia supernova. Ultimately, J1010+2358 is certainly a unique star giving insights into the earliest chemical enrichment. However, this star has not necessarily obtained any of its metals from a PISN. So the search continues for a concrete proof of the existence of zero-metallicity PISNe.

2024-04-29, **SN 1054 as a Pulsar-Driven Supernova: Implications for the Crab Pulsar and Remnant Evolution**, Conor M. B. Omand et.al., [2404.19017v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19017v1)

 One of the most studied objects in astronomy, the Crab Nebula, is the remnant of the historical supernova SN 1054. Historical observations of the supernova imply a typical supernova luminosity, but contemporary observations of the remnant imply a low explosion energy and low ejecta kinetic energy. These observations are incompatible with a standard $^{56}$Ni-powered supernova, hinting at an an alternate power source such as circumstellar interaction or a central engine. We examine SN 1054 using a pulsar-driven supernova model, similar to those used for superluminous supernovae. The model can reproduce the luminosity and velocity of SN 1054 for an initial spin period of $\sim$ 13 ms and an initial dipole magnetic field of 10$^{14-15}$ G. We discuss the implications of these results, including the evolution of the Crab pulsar, the evolution of the remnant structure, formation of filaments, and limits on freely expanding ejecta. We discuss how our model could be tested further through potential light echo photometry and spectroscopy, as well as the modern analogues of SN 1054.

2024-04-29, **SN 2024ggi in NGC 3621: Rising Ionization in a Nearby, CSM-Interacting Type II Supernova**, W. V. Jacobson-Galán et.al., [2404.19006v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19006v1)

 We present UV/optical/NIR observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a type II supernova (SN II) located in NGC 3621 at 7.2 Mpc. Early-time ("flash") spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi within +0.8 days of discovery shows emission lines of H I, He I, C III, and N III with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings (i.e., IIn-like) arising from the photoionized, optically-thick, unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) that surrounded the progenitor star at shock breakout. By the next spectral epoch at +1.5 days, SN 2024ggi showed a rise in ionization as emission lines of He II, C IV, N IV/V and O V became visible. This phenomenon is temporally consistent with a blueward shift in the UV/optical colors, both likely the result of shock breakout in an extended, dense CSM. The IIn-like features in SN 2024ggi persist on a timescale of $t\_{\rm IIn} = 3.8 \pm 1.6$ days at which time a reduction in CSM density allows the detection of Doppler broadened features from the fastest SN material. SN 2024ggi has peak UV/optical absolute magnitudes of $M\_{\rm w2} = -18.7$ mag and $M\_{\rm g} = -18.1$ mag that are consistent with the known population of CSM-interacting SNe II. Comparison of SN 2024ggi with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nLTE) radiative-transfer simulations suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 10^{-2}$M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v\_w$ = 50 km/s), confined to a distance of $r < 5\times 10^{14}$ cm. Assuming a wind velocity of $v\_w$ = 50 km/s, the progenitor star underwent an enhanced mass-loss episode in the last ~3 years before explosion.

2024-04-29, **Gamma-ray Emission from a Young Star Cluster in the Star-Forming Region RCW 38**, Paarmita Pandey et.al., [2404.19001v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19001v1)

 We report the detection of gamma-ray emission near the young Milky Way star cluster ($\approx$ 0.5 Myr old) in the star-forming region RCW 38. Using 15 years of data from the Fermi-LAT, we find a significant ($ \sigma > 22$) detection coincident with the cluster, producing a total $\gamma$-ray luminosity of $L\_{\gamma} = (2.66\pm 0.92) \times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ adopting a power-law spectral model ($\Gamma = 2.34\pm0.04$) in the 0.1 $-$ 500 GeV band. We estimate the total wind power to be $7 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a CR acceleration efficiency of $\eta\_{\rm CR} \simeq 0.4$ for a diffusion coefficient consistent with the local interstellar medium of $D = 10^{28}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$. Alternatively, the $\gamma$-ray luminosity could also account for a lower acceleration efficiency of 0.1 if the diffusion coefficient in the star-forming region is smaller, $D\simeq 2.5\times10^{27}\,{\rm cm^2\,\,s^{-1}}$. We compare the hot-gas pressure from Chandra X-ray analysis to the CR pressure and find the former is four orders of magnitude greater, suggesting that the CR pressure is not dynamically important relative to the stellar wind feedback. As RCW 38 is too young for supernovae to have occurred, the high CR acceleration efficiency in RCW 38 demonstrates that stellar winds may be an important source of Galactic cosmic rays.

2024-04-29, **The population of Galactic supernova remnants in the TeV range**, Rowan Batzofin et.al., [2404.18595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18595v1)

 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are likely to be significant sources of cosmic rays up to the knee of the local cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum. They produce gamma-rays in the very-high-energy (VHE) ($E>0.1$ TeV) range via: hadronic interactions with the interstellar medium and leptonic interactions with soft photons. Current observations have lead to the detection of about a dozen of VHE SNRs and future instruments should increase this number. The details of particle acceleration at SNRs, and of the mechanisms producing VHE gamma-rays at SNRs are poorly understood. We aim to study the population of SNRs detected in the TeV range and its properties, and to address fundamental questions of particle acceleration at SNR shocks: What is the spectrum of accelerated particles? What is the efficiency of acceleration? Is the VHE emission dominated by hadronic or leptonic interactions? By means of Monte Carlo methods, we simulate the population of SNRs in the VHE domain and confront our simulations to H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS). We explore the parameter space: the slope of accelerated particles $\alpha$, the electron-to-proton ratio $K\_{\rm ep}$, and the efficiency of particle acceleration $\xi $. We found sets of parameters for which $\gtrsim 90$\% of realisations are found in agreements with the HGPS data. These parameters are found $ 4.2 \gtrsim \alpha \gtrsim 4.1 $, $10^{-5} \lesssim K\_{\rm ep} \lesssim 10^{-4.5}$, and $0.03 \lesssim \xi\lesssim 0.1 $ . We were able to strongly argue against some regions of the parameter space: $\alpha \lesssim 4.05$, $\alpha \gtrsim 4.35$, or $K\_{\rm ep} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$. Our model is so far able to explain the SNR population of the HGPS. Our approach, confronted to the results of future systematic surveys, will help remove degeneracy in the solutions, and to better understand particle acceleration at SNR shocks.

2024-04-29, **Constraints on Tsallis cosmology using recent low redshift measurements**, M. L. Mendoza-Martínez et.al., [2404.18346v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18346v1)

 Recently Tsallis cosmology has been presented as a novel proposal for alleviating both $H\_0$ and $\sigma\_8$ tensions. Hence a universe filled with matter and radiation as perfect fluids and considering the Tsallis entropy is confronted using recent cosmological measurements coming from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, hydrogen II galaxies, quasars, and baryon acoustic oscillations. Following a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis and combining the samples, we constrain the main characteristic parameters $\alpha = 1.031^{+0.054}\_{-0.051}$ and $\delta = 1.005^{+0.001}\_{-0.001}$ where the uncertainties are $1\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, we estimate the today deceleration parameter $q\_0=-0.530^{+0.018}\_{-0.017}$, the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift $z\_T=0.632^{+0.028}\_{-0.028}$ and the age of the universe $\tau\_U = 12.637^{+0.067}\_{-0.066}\,\rm{Gyrs}$ which are in agreement with the standard cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) within $1.5\sigma$. Furthermore, we find that the dark energy equation of state is consistent with both phantom and quintessence behaviors within $1\sigma$ in the past and converging to $\Lambda$CDM in the future. Finally, Tsallis cosmology is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data, suggesting further studies at the perturbation level.
