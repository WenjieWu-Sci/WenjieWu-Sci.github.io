2024-12-03, **Gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions in conformal Majoron models of neutrino mass**, João Gonçalves et.al., [2412.02645v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02645v1)

 We study supercooled first-order phase transitions above the QCD scale in a wide class of conformal Majoron-like U(1)' models that explain the totality of active neutrino oscillation data and produce a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at LIGO, LISA and ET. We place constraints on the U(1)' breaking scale and gauge coupling using current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra data. We find that strong supercooling can be ruled out in large regions of parameter space if a SGWB is not detected by these experiments. A null signal at LIGO and ET will disfavor a type-I seesaw scale above $10^{14}$ GeV, while a positive signal is a signature of heavy right-handed neutrinos. On the other hand, LISA will be sensitive to seesaw scales as low as a TeV, and could detect a SGWB even if the right-handed neutrinos are decoupled.

2024-12-03, **Electromagnetic interactions in elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering**, Konstantin A. Kouzakov et.al., [2412.02169v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02169v1)

 A thorough account of electromagnetic interactions of massive Dirac neutrinos as well as their spin-flavor state in the theoretical formulation of elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering is given. The formalism of neutrino charge, magnetic, electric, and anapole form factors defined as matrices in the mass basis is employed under the assumption of three-neutrino mixing. The flavor and spin change of neutrinos propagating from the source to the detector is taken into account in the form of a spin-flavor density matrix of the neutrino arriving at the detector. The potential effects of the neutrino charge radii, magnetic moments, and spin polarization in the neutrino-nucleon scattering experiments are outlined.

2024-12-03, **The neutrino flavor oscillations in the static and spherically symmetric black-hole-like wormholes**, Yuxuan Shi et.al., [2412.02144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02144v1)

 We study the effects of neutrino lensing induced by a Damour-Solodukhin wormhole on the neutrino oscillation. We derive and calculate the flavour transition probabilities in the presence of Damour-Solodukhin factor $\Lambda$ as a shift in the massive source to show that the neutrino flavour oscillation is also sensitive not only to the sign of difference between the squared masses but also to the individual mass of neutrinos in both the two-flavour and the three-flavour cases, which is similar to the results for the black holes in the previous works mentioned here. As a consequence of parameter $\Lambda$ within a region, a series of curves of probability function versus the azimuthal angle $\phi$ with definite masses of neutrino can be plotted and their shapes resemble each other in the case of two-flavoured neutrinos and of three-flavoured ones. In view of the probability functions due to the wormhole, we reveal that the contribution of the factor $\Lambda$ is novel. Based on our analytical and numerical discussions on the probability expressions, the difference of the neutrino flavour oscillation arising from the shift in the wormhole factor $\Lambda$ is detectable. It is crucial that the $\Lambda$ as deviation from the black holes can change the shapes of the curves greatly, in the case of three-flavoured neutrinos in particular. The detailed comparisons can be made among our estimations depicted in the figures for neutrino oscillations and the measurements from the detector, which open a new window for judging whether the remote star as lens is black-hole-like wormhole or just a spherically symmetric black hole and further the wormhole factor $\Lambda$ can be estimated.

2024-12-03, **Exploring the Diversity of Faint Satellites in the M81 Group**, Katya Gozman et.al., [2412.02697v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02697v1)

 In the last decade, we have been able to probe further down the galaxy luminosity function than ever before and expand into the regime of ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs), which are some of the best probes we have of small-scale cosmology and galaxy formation. Digital sky surveys have enabled the discovery and study of these incredibly low-mass, highly dark-matter dominated systems around the Local Group, but it is critical that we expand the satellite census further out to understand if Milky Way and M31 satellites are representative of dwarf populations in the local Universe. Using data from HST/ACS, we present updated characterization of four satellite systems in the M81 group. These systems - D1005+68, D1006+69, DWJ0954+6821, and D1009+68 - were previously discovered using ground-based Subaru HSC data as overdensities in M81's halo and are now confirmed with HST/ACS by this work. These are all faint (M\_V >= -7.9) and consistent with old (~13 Gyr), metal-poor ([M/H] < -1.5) populations. Each system possesses relatively unusual features - including one of the most concentrated satellite galaxies with a Sersic index of n ~ 5, one of the most elliptical galaxies outside the Local Group with an e ~ 0.6, and one of the most compact galaxies for its magnitude. Two of the satellites have very low surface brightness, lower than most known galaxies in this absolute magnitude range. This work previews the scientific promise of the upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Telescope for illuminating the diversity of UFDs in the Local Volume and beyond.

2024-12-03, **Anatomy of singlet-doublet dark matter relic: annihilation, co-annihilation, co-scattering, and freeze-in**, Partha Kumar Paul et.al., [2412.02607v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02607v1)

 The singlet-doublet vector-like fermion dark matter model has been extensively studied in the literature over the past decade. An important parameter in this model is the singlet-doublet mixing angle ($\sin\theta$). All the previous studies have primarily focused on annihilation and co-annihilation processes for obtaining the correct dark matter relic density, assuming that the singlet and doublet components decouple at the same epoch. In this work, we demonstrate that this assumption holds only for larger mixing angles with a dependency on the mass of the dark matter. However, it badly fails for the mixing angle $\sin\theta<0.05$. We present a systematic study of the parameter space of the singlet-doublet dark matter relic, incorporating annihilation, co-annihilation, and, for the first time, co-scattering processes. Additionally, the freeze-in parameter space is also explored. We found that due to the inclusion of co-scattering processes, the correct relic density parameter space is shifted towards the detection sensitivity range of the LHC and MATHUSLA via displaced vertex signatures.

2024-12-03, **Bounds on Axions-Like Particles Shining in the Ultra-Violet**, Elisa Todarello et.al., [2412.02543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02543v1)

 Axion-like particles (ALPs) can decay into two photons with a rest-frame frequency given by half of the ALP mass. This implies that ultra-violet searches can be used to investigate ALPs in the multi-eV mass range. We use archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope between 110 and 170 nm to constrain ALPs with mass between 14.4-22.2 eV. We consider observations of a set of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and galaxy clusters and assume the ALP density in these objects to follow their dark matter density. The derived limit on the ALP-photon coupling $g\_{a\gamma}$ excludes values above $10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ over the whole mass range and surpasses previous limits by over one order of magnitude.

2024-12-03, **Exploring Dark Photon Production and Kinetic Mixing Constraints in Heavy-Ion Collisions**, Adrian William Romero Jorge et.al., [2412.02536v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02536v1)

 Vector $U$-bosons, often referred to as 'dark photons', are potential candidates for mediating dark matter interactions. In this study, we outline a procedure to derive theoretical constraints on the upper bound of the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon^2(M\_U)$ using dilepton data from heavy-ion from SIS to RHIC energies. The analysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport model, which successfully reproduces the measured dilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions. Besides the dilepton channels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model particles (such as mesons and baryons), we extend the PHSD approach to include the decay of hypothetical $U$-bosons into dileptons, $U \to e^+ e^-$. The production of these $U$-bosons occurs via Dalitz decays of pions, $\eta$-mesons, $\omega$-mesons, Delta resonances, as well as from the decays of vector mesons and $K^+$ mesons. This analysis provides an upper limit on $\epsilon^2(M\_U)$ and offers insights into the accuracy required for future experimental searches for dark photons through dilepton experiments.

2024-12-03, **Formation of solitons and their transitions in scalar-field dark matter models with a non-polynomial self-interaction potential**, Raquel Galazo García et.al., [2412.02519v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02519v1)

 We study the formation of solitons inside scalar-field dark matter halos with a non-polynomial self-interaction potential. We consider a self-interaction potential that is quartic in the scalar field in the low-density regime but saturates at large densities. This mimics the behaviour of axion monodromy potentials. We concentrate on the semi-classical regime, where the de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than the size of the system. We find that depending on the strength and scale of the self-interactions, the system can form solitons of the Thomas-Fermi type (dominated by self-interactions) or of the Fuzzy Dark Matter type (dominated by the quantum pressure). The system can also display transitions from a Thomas-Fermi soliton to a Fuzzy Dark Matter soliton as the former becomes unstable. We show that these behaviours can be understood from a simple Gaussian ansatz. We find that even in cases where the self-interactions are always subdominant they can play a critical role, by providing a small density boost that is enough to generate the seed for the formation of a Fuzzy Dark Matter soliton at much later times. We also point out that the intuition derived from a hydrodynamical picture can be misleading in regimes where wave effects are important.

2024-12-03, **Gravitational Waves as a Probe of Particle Dark Matter**, Sulagna Bhattacharya et.al., [2412.02453v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02453v1)

 Galactic dark matter (DM) particles, having non-gravitational interactions with nucleons, can interact with stellar constituents and eventually become captured within stars. Over the lifetime of the celestial body, these non-annihilating, heavy DM particles may accumulate and eventually form a comparable stellar mass black hole (BH), referred to as a Transmuted Black Hole (TBH). We investigate how current gravitational wave (GW) experiments could detect such particle DM through the presence of low-mass TBHs, which cannot form via standard stellar evolution. Different stellar objects (compact and non-compact) provide laboratories across DM-nucleon interaction regimes, offering insight into DM's mass and its non-gravitational properties.

2024-12-03, **Searches for signatures of ultra-light axion dark matter in polarimetry data of the European Pulsar Timing Array**, N. K. Porayko et.al., [2412.02232v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02232v1)

 Ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs) can be a viable solution to the dark matter problem. The scalar field associated with ALPs, coupled to the electromagnetic field, acts as an active birefringent medium, altering the polarisation properties of light through which it propagates. In particular, oscillations of the axionic field induce monochromatic variations of the plane of linearly polarised radiation of astrophysical signals. The radio emission of millisecond pulsars provides an excellent tool to search for such manifestations, given their high fractional linear polarisation and negligible fluctuations of their polarisation properties. We have searched for the evidence of ALPs in the polarimetry measurements of pulsars collected and preprocessed for the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) campaign. Focusing on the twelve brightest sources in linear polarisation, we searched for an astrophysical signal from axions using both frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks. For the frequentist analysis, which uses Lomb-Scargle periodograms at its core, no statistically significant signal has been found. The model used for the Bayesian analysis has been adjusted to accommodate multiple deterministic systematics that may be present in the data. A statistically significant signal has been found in the dataset of multiple pulsars with common frequency between $10^{-8}$ Hz and $2\times10^{-8}$ Hz, which can most likely be explained by the residual Faraday rotation in the terrestrial ionosphere. Strong bounds on the coupling constant $g\_{a\gamma}$, in the same ballpark as other searches, have been obtained in the mass range between $6\times10^{-24}$ eV and $5\times10^{-21}$ eV. We conclude by discussing problems that can limit the sensitivity of our search for ultra-light axions in the polarimetry data of pulsars, and possible ways to resolve them.

2024-12-03, **First Pulsar Polarization Array Limits on Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter**, Xiao Xue et.al., [2412.02229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02229v1)

 We conduct the first-ever Pulsar Polarization Array (PPA) analysis to detect the ultralight Axion-Like Dark Matter (ALDM) using the polarization data of 22 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. As one of the major dark matter candidates, the ultralight ALDM exhibits a pronounced wave nature on astronomical scales and offers a promising solution to small-scale structure issues within local galaxies. While the linearly polarized pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position angle (PA) can be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for detecting the ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the arrayed pulsars. To accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that allows us to construct pulsar PA residual time series, model noise contributions properly and search for pulsar cross-correlations. We find that for an ALDM density of $\rho\_0=0.4\,\textrm{GeV}/\textrm{cm}^3$, the Parkes PPA offers the best global limits on the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling, namely $\lesssim 10^{-13.5}-10^{-12.2}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, for the mass range of $10^{-22} - 10^{-21}~{\rm eV}$. The crucial role of pulsar cross-correlation in recognizing the nature of the derived limits is also highlighted.

2024-12-03, **An unbiased statistical study of the metallicity of core-collapse supernovae based on VLT/MUSE integral-field-unit spectroscopy**, Qiang Xi et.al., [2412.02667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02667v1)

 Metallicity plays a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars and their final core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy can provide a spatially resolved view of SN host galaxies and serve as a powerful tool to study SN metallicities. Early transient surveys targeted bright galaxies with high star formation and SN rates; as a result, the discovered SNe are significantly biased toward high metallicities. More recently, the untargeted, wide-field transient surveys, such as ASAS-SN and ZTF, have discovered a large number of SNe without such a bias. In this work, we construct a large and unbiased sample of SNe discovered by (quasi-) untargted searches, consisting of 209 SNe of Types II (with unknown subtypes), IIP, IIn, IIb, Ib and Ic at z $\leq$ 0.02 with VLT/MUSE observations. This is currently the largest CCSN sample with IFU observations. With the strong-line method, we reveal the spatially-resolved metallicity maps of the SN host galaxies and acquire accurate metallicity measurements for the SN sites. Our results show that the SN metallicities range from 12 + log(O/H) = 8.1 to 8.7 dex, and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are very close to each other, with mean and median values of 8.4 - 8.5 dex. We carefully analysed the stochastic sampling effect, showing that our large sample size narrows the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty down to only 0.05 dex. The apparent metallicity differences among SN types are all within 3$\sigma$ uncertainties and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are all consistent with being randomly drawn from the same reference distribution. This suggests that metallicity plays a minor role in the origin of different CCSN types and some other metallicity-insensitive processes, such as binary interaction, dominate the distinction of CCSN types.

2024-12-03, **Late-time HST and JWST Observations of GRB 221009A: Evidence for a Break in the Light Curve at 50 Days**, Huei Sears et.al., [2412.02663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02663v1)

 GRB 221009A is one of the brightest transients ever observed with the highest peak gamma-ray flux for a gamma-ray burst (GRB). A type Ic-BL supernova (SN), SN 2022xiw, was definitively detected in late-time JWST spectroscopy (t = 195 days, observer-frame). However, photometric studies have found SN 2022xiw to be less luminous (10-70%) than the canonical GRB-SN, SN 1998bw. We present late-time Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 and JWST/NIRCam imaging of the afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 221009A at t ~ 185, 277, and 345 days post-trigger. Our joint archival ground, HST, and JWST light curve fits show strong support for a break in the light curve decay slope at t = 50 +/- 10 days (observer-frame) and a supernova at $1.4^{+0.37}\_{-0.40} \times$ the optical/NIR flux of SN 1998bw. This break is consistent with an interpretation as a jet break when requiring slow-cooling electrons in a wind medium with the electron energy spectral index, p > 2, and $\nu\_m < \nu\_c$. Our light curve and joint HST/JWST spectral energy distribution (SED) also show evidence for the late-time emergence of a bluer component in addition to the fading afterglow and supernova. We find consistency with the interpretations that this source is either a young, massive, low-metallicity star cluster or a scattered light echo of the afterglow with a SED shape of $f\_{\nu} \propto \nu^{2.0\pm1.0}$.

2024-12-03, **Temporal-spatial distribution of YSOs nearby Taurus region**, Jiaming Liu et.al., [2412.02456v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02456v1)

 The Taurus region is one of the most extensively studied star-forming regions. Surveys indicate that the young stars in this region are comprised of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) that cluster in groups associated with the molecular cloud (Grouped Young Stellar Objects, GYSOs), and some older ones that are sparsely distributed throughout the region (Distributed Young Stellar Objects, DYSOs). To bridge the age gap between the GYSOs ($\le$5 Myr) and the DYSOs (10-20 Myr), we conducted a survey to search for new YSOs in this direction. Based on infrared color excesses and Li I absorption lines, we identified 145 new YSOs. Combining these with the previously identified GYSOs and DYSOs, we constructed a sample of 519 YSOs that encompasses the entire region. Subsequently, we calculated the ages of the sample based on their proximity to the local bubble. The age versus Distance to the Local Bubble ($D\_{\rm LB}$) relationship for the DYSOs shows a clear trend: the farther they are from the Local Bubble, the younger they are, which is consistent with the supernovae-driven formation scenario of the Local Bubble. The GYSOs also exhibit a mild age versus $D\_{\rm LB}$ trend. However, they are significantly younger and are mostly confined to distances of 120 to 220 pc. Considering their distribution in the age versus $D\_{\rm LB}$ space is well separated from the older DYSOs, they may also be products of the Local Bubble but formed in more recent and localized events.

2024-12-03, **Viscous cosmological fluids and large-scale structure**, BG Mbewe et.al., [2412.02276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02276v1)

 In this paper, we study the viscous fluid cosmological model that when certain conditions are invoked mimics the $\Lambda$CDM model. The background equations governing the evolution of viscous interacting fluids in a multifluid system are derived. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is applied to constrain the best-fit cosmological parameters with Supernova Type 1a data. In addition, linear cosmological perturbations are investigated in a dust-matter-dominated frame using a $1+3$ covariant formalism approach. It is evident from the perturbation results obtained that the model predicts the disintegration of bound structures of large-scale structures in the late-time universe.
