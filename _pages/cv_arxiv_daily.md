2024-09-25, **Correlative study of flavor anomalies and dark matter in the light of scalar leptoquark**, Manas Kumar Mohapatra et.al., [2409.16961v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16961v1)

 We explore $U(1)\_{L\_e-L\_\mu}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model with particle content enlarged by three neutral fermions, of which the lightest one contributes to dark matter content of the Universe. The scalar sector is enriched with a $\tilde{R}\_2$ scalar leptoquark doublet to investigate flavor anomalies in $B$-meson sector, an additional inert scalar doublet to realize neutrino mass at one loop and a scalar singlet to spontaneously break the new $U(1)$. We discuss dark matter relic density and direct detection cross section in scalar and gauge portals. New physics contribution for $b \to s$ transition comes from penguin diagrams with $Z^\prime$, leptquark and new fermions. We analyze the constraints on the model parameters from the established observables of $B \to K^{(*)} \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $B\_s\to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay channels. Utilizing the permissible parameter space consistent with both flavor and dark sectors, we discuss the impact on various observables such as branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal polarisation asymmetry, and also lepton non-universality of $\Lambda\_b \to \Lambda ^* (1520) (\to pK) \ell ^+\ell ^-$ decay channel.

2024-09-25, **From angular coefficients to quantum observables: a phenomenological appraisal in di-boson systems**, Michele Grossi et.al., [2409.16731v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16731v1)

 Motivated by the growing interest in accessing the spin structure of multi-boson processes and in measuring quantum entanglement at high energies, we study polarisation and spin-correlation coefficients in di-boson systems. We show that higher-order corrections of QCD and electroweak type, off-shell modelling, and realistic effects such as fiducial selections and neutrino reconstruction are unavoidable to properly determine such coefficients, and consequently to provide a sound interpretation of observables sensitive to quantum entanglement and Bell-inequality violation. Our findings are based on a detailed phenomenological analysis of boson pairs at the LHC, either in inclusive electroweak production or coming from Higgs-boson decays.

2024-09-25, **Inclusive and diffractive neutrino-nucleus scattering at high energy**, Anh Dung Le et.al., [2409.16705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16705v1)

 We calculate the energy dependence of inclusive and diffractive neutrino-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering cross sections within the dipole picture, focusing on the ultra-high-energy regime. We predict an up to $\sim 10\%$ nuclear suppression in the inclusive neutrino-Oxygen scattering originating from the non-linear QCD dynamics in the small-$x$ Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution. Diffraction is found to be a small $1\dots 4\%$ contribution to the total cross section across a wide range of neutrino energies relevant for current and near-future experiments. The diffractive cross section is calculated separately for the coherent and incoherent channels that are found to be of equal importance. Additionally, we include the dominant contribution from the $\|q\bar q g\rangle$ Fock state of the $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons in the high-$Q^2$ limit, along with the lowest-order $\|q\bar q\rangle$ contribution. The $\|q\bar{q}g\rangle$ contribution is found to be numerically significant, reaching up to 40\% of the diffractive cross section.

2024-09-25, **Single Production of Doubly Charged Higgs at Muon Collider**, Jie-Cheng Jia et.al., [2409.16582v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16582v1)

 In this paper, we study the single production of doubly charged Higgs $H^{\pm\pm}$ in the type-II seesaw at the high energy muon collider. Compared with the pair production channel $\mu^+\mu^-\to H^{++} H^{--}$, the single production channel $\mu^+\mu^-\to \mu^\mp\ell^\mp H^{\pm\pm}$ in principle could probe the mass region above the threshold $m\_{H^{\pm\pm}}>\sqrt{s}/2$. The single production channel depends on the Yukawa coupling $h$, which is related to the neutrino oscillation parameters. We show that the Majorana phases $\phi\_1$ and $\phi\_2$ have great impact on the individual cross section of the single production. We find that the same sign dilepton signature from $H^{\pm\pm}\to \ell^\pm\ell^\pm$ could probe $m\_{H^{\pm\pm}}\lesssim2.6(7.1)$ TeV at the 3 (10) TeV muon collider when the triplet VEV $v\_\Delta\lesssim3$ eV.

2024-09-24, **The Unknowns of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background Hinder New Physics Searches**, Miller MacDonald et.al., [2409.16367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16367v1)

 Neutrinos traveling over cosmic distances are ideal probes of new physics. We leverage on the approaching detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) to explore whether, if the DSNB showed departures from theoretical predictions, we could attribute such modifications to new physics unequivocally. In order to do so, we focus on visible neutrino decay. Many of the signatures from neutrino decay are degenerate with astrophysical unknowns entering the DSNB modeling. Next generation neutrino observatories, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, as well as DUNE, will set stringent limits on a neutrino lifetime over mass ratio $\tau/m \sim 10^{9}$-$10^{10}$ s eV$^{-1}$ at $90\%$ C.L., if astrophysical uncertainties and detector backgrounds were to be fully under control. However, if the lightest neutrino is almost massless and the neutrino mass ordering is normal, constraining visible decay will not be realistically possible in the coming few decades. We also assess the challenges of distinguishing among different new physics scenarios (such as visible decay, invisible decay, and quasi-Dirac neutrinos), all leading up to similar signatures in the DSNB. This work shows that the DSNB potential for probing new physics strongly depends on an improved understanding of the experimental backgrounds at next generation neutrino observatories as well as progress in the DSNB modeling.

2024-09-24, **Probing the equation of state of neutron stars using neutrino oscillations**, Siddhartha Bandyopadhyay et.al., [2409.16232v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16232v1)

 We study the phenomena of neutrino oscillations and flavour mixing by incorporating the gravitational effects through the Dirac equation in curved spacetime inside a spherically symmetric star. We show that the flavour transition probabilities of the neutrinos depend on the interior spacetime metric as they propagate out of the star. As a consequence, we show that one could distinguish between different possible equation of states of nuclear matter even for an isolated neutron star if one could determine the flavour composition of emitted neutrinos near the stellar surface.

2024-09-24, **Exploring the neutral pion production data of MINER$Î½$A**, R K Pradhan et.al., [2409.15913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15913v1)

 With the neutrino experiments advancing towards high-precision measurements and greater emphasis on reducing systematic uncertainties, embedding the single-pion production models, a major component of the hadronic activity observed in the neutrino oscillation experiments, into the Monte Carlo simulations is crucial. This work presents the measurements of the struck nucleon's Fermi motion with the transverse kinematic imbalance approach by analyzing the charged-current neutral pion production on carbon nucleus in MINER$\nu$A. A minimal tuning of GENIE and NuWro based on their default models shows an improvement in the prediction of single $\pi^0$ production. The prediction describes the data more accurately in the higher momentum tail however, discrepancies between the predictions and data below the Fermi peak highlight the limitations in current nuclear models used in the Monte Carlo generators.

2024-09-24, **Interplay and Correlations Between Quark and Lepton Observables in Modular Symmetry Models**, Gui-Jun Ding et.al., [2409.15823v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15823v1)

 We present the first combined analysis of quark and lepton observables in flavour models based on modular invariance. The analysis is performed within a specific model with modular $2O$ symmetry. Unlike previous studies, which analyzed observables in the quark and lepton sectors separately, our work unifies their treatment under a single framework governed by a common complex modulus $\tau$ and twelve real parameters. The model is in good agreement with experimental data, while also predicting unmeasured lepton observables such as the leptonic Dirac CP-violation (CPV) phase, the two Majorana CPV phases, the lightest neutrino mass $m\_1$ in normal ordering, and the effective masses $m\_\beta$ and $m\_{\beta\beta}$, which are measured in beta decay and neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. These predictions fall within ranges that can be tested by current and future experiments, providing a concrete opportunity to probe the considered modular symmetry framework. Our results show that the $2O$ modular symmetry offers a natural, minimal-parameter explanation for quark and lepton mixing, revealing important correlations between the observables in the two sectors. This unified analysis opens new directions for investigations in neutrino and precision flavor physics.

2024-09-25, **A singlet scalar assisted $N_{2}$ Leptogenesis and Pseudo-Scalar Dark Matter**, Dilip Kumar Ghosh et.al., [2409.17067v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17067v1)

 We study the Leptogenesis and Dark Matter in the presence of an extra singlet complex scalar field in an extended discrete $\mathcal{Z\_{\rm 3}}$ symmetry. The vacuum expectation value of the new scalar spontaneously breaks the $\mathcal{Z\_{\rm 3}}$ symmetry. A remnant CP-like $\mathcal{Z\_{\rm 2}}$ symmetry stabilizes the imaginary part of the complex scalar field which can act as a pseudo-Goldstone DM. The real part of the complex scalar couples to RHN opens up new decay channels which can lead to a larger CP-violation in generating the lepton asymmetry. Thus the singlet complex scalar plays a crucial role in understanding the Leptogenesis and Dark Matter parameter space. This singlet complex scalar is also responsible for the First-Order Phase Transition (FOPT) which may provide observable stochastic Gravitational wave signatures. We discuss the possible correlations among these three phenomena.

2024-09-25, **Matching current observational constraints with non-minimally coupled dark energy**, William J. Wolf et.al., [2409.17019v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17019v1)

 We show that a universe with a non-minimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using various information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.

2024-09-25, **A gas rich cosmic web revealed by partitioning the missing baryons**, Liam Connor et.al., [2409.16952v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16952v1)

 Approximately half of the Universe's dark matter resides in collapsed halos; significantly less than half of the baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) remains confined to halos. A small fraction of baryons are in stars and the interstellar medium within galaxies. The lion's share are diffuse (less than $10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) and ionized (neutral fraction less than $10^{-4}$), located in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and in the halos of galaxy clusters, groups, and galaxies. The quantity and spatial distribution of this diffuse ionized gas is notoriously difficult to measure, but has wide implications for galaxy formation, astrophysical feedback, and precision cosmology. Recently, the dispersion of extragalactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has been used to measure the total content of cosmic baryons. However, past efforts had modest samples and methods that cannot discriminate between IGM and halo gas, which is critical for studying feedback and for observational cosmology. Here, we present a large cosmological sample of FRB sources localized to their host galaxies. We have robustly partitioned the missing baryons into the IGM, galaxy clusters, and galaxies, providing a late-Universe measurement of the total baryon density of $\Omega\_b h\_{70}$=0.049$\pm$0.003. Our results indicate efficient feedback processes that can expel gas from galaxy halos and into the intergalactic medium, agreeing with the enriched cosmic web scenario seen in cosmological simulations. The large diffuse baryon fraction that we have measured disfavours bottom-heavy stellar initial mass functions, which predict a large total stellar density, $\Omega\_*$.

2024-09-25, **Relative distances and peculiar velicities of 140 groups and clusters of galaxies at low redshifts: the Hubble diagram**, Flera G. Kopylova et.al., [2409.16871v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16871v1)

 To determine the relative distances and peculiar velocities of 140 groups and clusters of galaxies at low redshifts ($z$ < 0.12), we used the fundamental plane (FP) of early-type galaxies (from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data). We constructed the Hubble diagram for the relative distances of galaxy groups/clusters versus their radial velocities in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) reference frame in the flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model ($\Omega\_m=0.3$, $H\_0=70$~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$). We have found that the standard logarithmic deviation for groups and clusters of galaxies on the Hubble diagram (minus peculiar velocities) is $\pm0.0173$ ($N$ = 140), which corresponds to a deviation of $70\pm2.8$~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the Hubble constant. For a sample of galaxy systems ($N$ = 63), the X-ray luminosity of which is in an interval of (0.151--4)~$\times 10^{44}$~erg/s, this quantity turned out to be $70\pm2.1$~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The root-mean-square deviations of peculiar velocities with quadratic accounting for errors are $<V\_{pec}^2>^{1/2}$ = $714\pm7$~km/s and $600\pm7$~km/s, respectively. For five large superclusters of galaxies from the SDSS region, the average peculiar velocity relaive to the CMB reference frame is $+240\pm250$~km/s. We detected no outflow of galaxy systems from the void (Giant Void, $\alpha \approx 13^h, \delta \approx 40^\circ, z \approx 0.107$) formed by groups and clusters of galaxies.

2024-09-25, **Understanding the Radial Acceleration Relation of Dwarf Galaxies with Emergent Gravity**, Sanghyeon Han et.al., [2409.16655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16655v1)

 We examine whether the radial acceleration relation (RAR) of dwarf galaxies can be explained by Verlinde's emergent gravity. This is the extension of arXiv:2206.11685v3, which examines the RAR of typical spiral galaxies, to less massive systems. To do this, we compile the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles of 30 dwarf galaxies in the Local Group from the literature. We then calculate the expected gravitational acceleration from the stellar component in the framework of the emergent gravity, and compare it with that from observations. The calculated acceleration with the emergent gravity under the assumption of a quasi-de Sitter universe agrees with the observed one within the uncertainty. Our results suggest that the emergent gravity can explain the kinematics of galaxies without introducing dark matter, even for less massive galaxies where dark matter is expected to dominate. This sharply contrasts with MOND, where a new interpolating function has to be introduced for dwarf galaxies to explain their kinematics without dark matter.

2024-09-25, **Optimised neural network predictions of galaxy formation histories using semi-stochastic corrections**, Jayashree Behera et.al., [2409.16548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16548v1)

 We present a novel methodology to improve neural network (NN) predictions of galaxy formation histories by incorporating semi-stochastic corrections to account for short-timescale variability. Our paper addresses limitations in existing models that capture broad trends in galaxy evolution, but fail to reproduce the bursty nature of star formation and chemical enrichment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of key observables such as stellar masses, optical spectra, and colour distributions. We introduce a simple technique to add stochastic components by utilizing the power spectra of galaxy formation histories. We justify our stochastic approach by studying the correlation between the phases of the halo mass assembly and star-formation histories in the IllustrisTNG simulation, and we find that they are correlated only on timescales longer than 6 Gyr, with a strong dependence on galaxy type. Building on NNs developed in Chittenden & Tojeiro (2023), trained on hydrodynamical simulations from the IllustrisTNG project, which predict time-resolved star formation and stellar metallicity histories for central and satellite galaxies based solely on the properties and evolution of their dark matter halos and environments, this approach successfully recovers realistic variability in galaxy properties at short timescales. It significantly improves the accuracy of predicted stellar masses, metallicities, spectra, and colour distributions and provides a powerful framework for generating large, realistic mock galaxy catalogs, while also enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and dark matter halo assembly.

2024-09-24, **A Heavy Seed Black Hole Mass Function at High Redshift -- Prospects for LISA**, Joe McCaffrey et.al., [2409.16413v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16413v1)

 The advent of new and near-future observatories probing the earliest epochs of the Universe has opened the opportunity to investigate the formation and growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs). Additionally, the use of high resolution cosmological simulations to investigate these high-redshift environments is needed to predict the dark matter halos in which these MBH seeds will form. We use the $\textit{Renaissance}$ simulations to analyse the formation and growth of so-called heavy seed black holes. Other past work has investigated the formation and growth of light (black hole) seeds with $\textit{Renaissance}$ and found that these black holes do not grow in the environments in which they reside. In this work we seed MBHs, in post-processing, and track accretion onto the MBHs as well as mergers with other MBHs at high-redshift. We show that the heavy seeds struggle to achieve high accretion rates with only the most massive black holes ($\gtrsim 10^5 \text{M}\_\odot$) growing at close to the Eddington limit under optimistic conditions. Despite the lack of significant growth for these early MBHs, the signals from their merger events will be sufficiently strong (SNR $\sim 10^2$) to be probed by the next generation of gravitational wave observatories, such as $\textit{LISA}$. We predict that $\textit{LISA}$ will observe of the order of $10$ MBH merger events per year where the mergers occur at z $\gtrsim$ 10 or at least begin their early inspiral phase at z $\gtrsim$ 10.

2024-09-24, **On the CP Properties of Spin-0 Dark Matter**, Atri Dey et.al., [2409.16360v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16360v1)

 Aiming to uncover the CP properties of spin-0 particle Dark Matter (DM), we explore a two-component DM scenario within the framework of 3-Higgs Doublet Models (3HDMs), a well-motivated set-up previously studied due to the complementarity of its collider and astrophysical probes. We devise benchmark points in which the two components of DM have same CP in one case and opposite CP in another. We then show several cross section distributions of observables at collider experiments where the two cases are clearly distinguishable.

2024-09-24, **Detecting dark objects with plasma microlensing by their gravitational wakes**, M. Sten Delos et.al., [2409.16348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16348v1)

 A moving mass makes a gravitational wake in the partially ionized interstellar medium, which acts as a lens for radio-frequency light. Consequently, plasma microlensing could complement gravitational microlensing in the search for invisible massive objects, such as stellar remnants or compact dark matter. This work explores the spatial structure of the plasma lens associated with a gravitational wake. Far away from the moving mass, the characteristic lensing signal is the steady demagnification or magnification of a radio source as the wake passes in front of it at the speed of sound. Sources can be plasma lensed at a much greater angular distance than they would be gravitationally lensed to the same degree by the same object. However, only the wakes of objects greatly exceeding stellar mass are expected to dominate over the random turbulence in the interstellar medium.

2024-09-24, **TRINITY VI: Connection between Galaxy Star Formation Rates and Supermassive Black Hole Accretion Rates from z=0-10**, Haowen Zhang et.al., [2409.16347v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16347v1)

 We infer supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rates and Eddington ratios as a function of SMBH/host galaxy mass and redshift with the empirical TRINITY model of dark matter halo--galaxy--SMBH connection. The galaxy--SMBH mass and growth rate connection from TRINITY is constrained by galaxy observables from $0<z<13$ and SMBH observables from $0<z<6.5$. Key findings include: 1) the ratio between cosmic SMBH accretion rate and galaxy star formation rate stays constant at $\sim 2\times 10^{-3}$ from $z=0-4$, and decreases by 2 orders of magnitude from $z=4-10$; 2) the average SMBH Eddington ratio $\overline{\eta}$ increases towards higher redshifts, nearly reaching $\overline{\eta}=1$ at $z\sim 10$; 3) at fixed redshift for $z<3$, SMBHs/galaxies with higher masses have lower $\overline{\eta}$, consistent with AGN downsizing; 4) the average ratio of specific SMBH accretion rate ($\overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}$) to average specific star formation rate ($\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}$) is nearly mass-independent, with a value $\overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}/\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}\sim 1$, which decreases slightly from $z=10$ to $z=0$; 5) similar to galaxies, SMBHs reach their peak efficiency to convert baryons into mass when host halos reach $10^{12} M\_\odot$; 6) given galaxy and SMBH growth histories from TRINITY, the local descendants of $1<z<11$ overmassive JWST AGNs will remain outliers from the local SMBH mass--galaxy mass relation. These findings combine to give a simple explanation for massive ($10^9-10^{10}M\_\odot$) quasars at $z>6$: at these redshifts, dark matter halos experience $\sim$Eddington specific growth rates, driving $\sim$Eddington specific growth rates in both galaxies and SMBHs.

2024-09-24, **Light Dark Fermion in Two Natural Scenarios**, Ernest Ma et.al., [2409.16246v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16246v1)

 Dark matter is postulated as a light fermion in two natural scenarios as the outcome of a softly broken discrete symmetry. It is produced from the naturally suppressed decay of the standard-model Higgs boson through the freeze-in mechanism.

2024-09-24, **Low-scale Mirror Standard Model Dark Matter and its Detection via Gravitational Waves and the Guitar Nebula**, V. K Oikonomou et.al., [2409.16095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16095v1)

 What if the dark matter Sector is truly dark, self-interacting and unreachable by terrestrial experiments? How could we find hints of such dark sector if it is experimentally unreachable by any terrestrial experiment? In this work we study a low-mass-scale mirror Standard Model which can act as a model for dark matter, which interacts only gravitationally with the Standard Model particles. The mirror Standard Model sector particles can form mirror atoms and hadrons and all these stable particles can comprise a large part of the dark matter of the Universe. These mirror Standard Model particles acquire mass through a low-temperature dark first order phase transition. We examine in detail this dark phase transition and we indicate how stochastic gravitational waves can be generated through this transition. Such a phase transition can generate stochastic gravitational waves that can be detected by the future gravitational wave experiments. For the model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can be detected by the SKA. Moreover, we propose a possible way to detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational data coming from the guitar nebula. We assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the interaction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar medium, which is assumed to be comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be directly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a large angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar medium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas. This is motivated by the Bosma effect which indicates that hydrogen is always in correlation with dark matter, and hydrogen gas is strongly present in the guitar nebula.

2024-09-24, **Evaluating the galaxy formation histories predicted by a neural network in pure dark matter simulations**, Harry George Chittenden et.al., [2409.16079v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16079v1)

 We investigate a series of galaxy properties computed using the merger trees and environmental histories from dark matter only cosmological simulations, using the predictive semi-recurrent neural network outlined in Chittenden and Tojeiro (2023), and using stochastic improvements presented in our companion paper: Behera, Tojeiro and Chittenden (2024). We apply these methods to the dark matter only runs of the IllustrisTNG simulations to understand the effects of baryon removal, and to the gigaparsec-volume pure dark matter simulation Uchuu, to understand the effects of the lower resolution or alternative metrics for halo properties. We find that the machine learning model recovers accurate summary statistics derived from the predicted star formation and stellar metallicity histories, and correspondent spectroscopy and photometry. However, the inaccuracies of the model's application to dark simulations are substantial for low mass and slowly growing haloes. For these objects, the halo mass accretion rate is exaggerated due to the lack of stellar feedback, yet the formation of the halo can be severely limited by the absence of low mass progenitors in a low resolution simulation. Furthermore, differences in the structure and environment of higher mass haloes results in an overabundance of red, quenched galaxies. These results signify progress towards a machine learning model which builds high fidelity mocks based on a physical interpretation of the galaxy-halo connection, yet they illustrate the need to account for differences in halo properties and the resolution of the simulation.

2024-09-24, **Condensate decay in a radiation dominated cosmology**, Shuyang Cao et.al., [2409.16076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16076v1)

 We study the decay of a homogeneous condensate of a massive scalar field of mass \emph{m} into massless fields in thermal equilibrium in a radiation dominated cosmology. The model is a \emph{proxy} for the non-equilibrium dynamics of a misaligned axion condensate decaying into radiation. After consistent field quantization in the cosmological background, we obtain the causal equations of motion for a homogeneous condensate including the finite temperature self-energy corrections up to one loop. The dynamical renormalization group is implemented to obtain the time dependent relaxation rate that describes the decay dynamics of the condensate amplitude from stimulated emission and recombination of massless quanta in the medium. It is explicitly shown that a simple friction term in the equation of motion does not describe correctly the decay of the condensate. During the super-Hubble regime, relevant for ultralight dark matter, the condensate amplitude decays as $e^{-\frac{g^2}{10} t^2\,\ln(1/mt)}$. In the sub-Hubble regime the amplitude decays as $e^{-\gamma(t;T(t))/2}$ with $T(t)=T\_0/a(t)$, therefore the finite temperature contribution to the decay rate vanishes fast during the expansion. A main conclusion is that a phenomenological friction term is inadequate to describe the decay in the super-Hubble regime, the decay function $\gamma(t)$ is always \emph{smaller} than that from a local friction term as a consequence of the cosmological expansion. For ultra light dark matter, the time scale during which transient dynamics is sensitive to cosmological expansion and a local friction term is inadequate, is much longer. A friction term always \emph{underestimates} the time scale of decay in the sub-Hubble case.

2024-09-24, **Strange Stars Admixed with Mirror Dark Matter: Confronting Observations of XTE J1814-338**, Shu-Hua Yang et.al., [2409.15969v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15969v1)

 In this paper, we explore a novel framework for explaining the mass and radius relationships of observed neutron stars by considering strange stars (SSs) admixed with mirror dark matter (MDM). We develop a theoretical model that incorporates non-commutative algebra to describe the interactions between ordinary strange quark matter (SQM) and MDM, which are predicted to form compact objects that could explain recent astrophysical data, including observations of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0437-4715, and the central compact object in HESS J1731-347. Notably, we demonstrate that the exotic mass-radius measurement of XTE J1814-338 can be explained by the presence of a mirror SS with an ordinary SQM core. In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system. We provide detailed mass-radius comparisons with observational data and discuss future observations that could test the predictions of our model, offering new insights into neutron star structure and the role of dark matter in compact objects.

 An upgrade of the COSINE-100 experiment, COSINE-100U, has been prepared for installation at Yemilab, a new underground laboratory in Korea, following 6.4 years of operation at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory. The COSINE-100 experiment aimed to investigate the annual modulation signals reported by the DAMA/LIBRA but observed a null result, revealing a more than 3$\sigma$ discrepancy. COSINE-100U seeks to explore new parameter spaces for dark matter detection using NaI(Tl) detectors. All eight NaI(Tl) crystals, with a total mass of 99.1 kg, have been upgraded to improve light collection efficiency, significantly enhancing dark matter detection sensitivity. This paper describes the detector upgrades, performance improvements, and the enhanced sensitivity to low-mass dark matter detection in the COSINE-100U experiment.

 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, when combined with Planck satellite Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and Type Ia Supernovae, suggest a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) at a significance level ranging from $2.5\sigma$ to $3.9\sigma$. In this work, I test whether, and to what extent, this preference is supported by CMB experiments other than Planck. I analyze the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) temperature, polarization, and lensing spectra at small scales, eventually combining them with Planck or WMAP 9-year observations at large angular scales. My analysis shows that ACT and WMAP data, when combined with DESI BAO and Pantheon-plus Supernovae, yield independent constraints with a precision comparable to Planck. Notably, in this case, the cosmological constant value is recovered within two standard deviations. A preference for DDE reappears when Pantheon-plus is replaced with distance moduli measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DESy5). However, it remains less pronounced compared to the Planck-based results. When considering SPT data, no clear preference for DDE is found, although the parameter uncertainties are significantly larger compared to both Planck- and ACT-based constraints. Overall, CMB experiments other than Planck generally weaken the evidence for DDE. I argue that the subsets of Planck data that strengthen the shift toward DDE are the temperature and E-mode polarization anisotropy measurements at large angular scales $\ell \lesssim 30$.

 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events detected from beyond the Milky Way. FRB emission characteristics favor highly magnetized neutron stars, or magnetars, as the sources, as evidenced by FRB-like bursts from a galactic magnetar, and the star-forming nature of FRB host galaxies. However, the processes that produce FRB sources remain unknown. Although galactic magnetars are often linked to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), it's uncertain what determines which supernovae result in magnetars. The galactic environments of FRB sources can be harnessed to probe their progenitors. Here, we present the stellar population properties of 30 FRB host galaxies discovered by the Deep Synoptic Array. Our analysis shows a significant deficit of low-mass FRB hosts compared to the occurrence of star-formation in the universe, implying that FRBs are a biased tracer of star-formation, preferentially selecting massive star-forming galaxies. This bias may be driven by galaxy metallicity, which is positively correlated with stellar mass. Metal-rich environments may favor the formation of magnetar progenitors through stellar mergers, as higher metallicity stars are less compact and more likely to fill their Roche lobes, leading to unstable mass transfer. Although massive stars do not have convective interiors to generate strong magnetic fields by dynamo, merger remnants are thought to have the requisite internal magnetic-field strengths to result in magnetars. The preferential occurrence of FRBs in massive star-forming galaxies suggests that CCSN of merger remnants preferentially forms magnetars.

 We present an analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic dataset of the Type II supernova (SN) 2018ivc in the nearby (10 Mpc) galaxy Messier 77. Thanks to the high cadence of the CHASE survey, we observed the SN rising very rapidly by nearly three magnitudes in five hours (or 18 mag d$^{-1}$). The $r$-band light curve presents four distinct phases: the maximum light is reached in just one day, then a first, rapid linear decline precedes a short-duration plateau. Finally, a long, slower linear decline lasted for one year. Following a radio rebrightening, we detected SN 2018ivc four years after the explosion. The early spectra show a blue, nearly featureless continuum, but the spectra evolve rapidly: after about 10 days a prominent H$\alpha$ line starts to emerge, with a peculiar profile, but the spectra are heavily contaminated by emission lines from the host galaxy. He I lines, namely $\lambda\lambda$5876,7065, are also strong. On top of the former, a strong absorption from the Na I doublet is visible, indicative of a non-negligible internal reddening. From its equivalent width, we derive a lower limit on the host reddening of $A\_V\simeq1.5$ mag, while from the Balmer decrement and a match of the $B-V$ colour curve of SN 2018ivc to that of the comparison objects, a host reddening of $A\_V\simeq3.0$ mag is obtained. The spectra are similar to those of SNe II, but with strong He lines. Given the peculiar light curve and spectral features, we suggest SN 2018ivc could be a transitional object between the Type IIL and Type IIb SNe classes. In addition, we found signs of interaction with circumstellar medium in the light curve, making SN 2018ivc also an interacting event. Finally, we modelled the early multi-band light curves and photospheric velocity of SN 2018ivc to estimate the explosion and CSM physical parameters.

 Magnetic turbulence is classified as weak or strong based on the relative amplitude of the magnetic field fluctuations compared to the mean field. These two classifications have different energy transport properties. This study analyzes interstellar turbulence based on this classification. Specifically, we examine the ISM of simulated galaxies to detect evidence of strong magnetic turbulence and provide statistics on the associated magnetic coherent structures (MCoSs), such as current sheets, that arise in this context. We analyzed MHD galaxy simulations with different initial magnetic field structures (ordered or random) and studied the magnetic field fluctuations ($\delta B/B\_0$) and the MCoSs, defined here as regions where the current density surpasses a certain threshold. We also studied the MCoS sizes and kinematics. The magnetic field disturbances in both models follow a log-normal distribution, peaking at values close to unity, which turns into a power-law at large values ($\rm \delta B/B\_0 > 1$). The current densities are widely distributed, with deviations from a log-normal at the largest values. These deviating values of the current density define MCoSs. We find that, in both models, MCoSs are fractally distributed in space, with a typical volume-filling factor of about 10 percent, and tend to coincide with peaks of star formation density. Their fractal dimension is close to unity below kpc scales and between 2 and 3 on larger scales. Our work challenges the prevailing paradigm of weak magnetic turbulence in the ISM by demonstrating that strong magnetic disturbances occur even when the initial magnetic field is initially ordered due to differential rotation and supernova feedback. Our findings provide a foundation for a strong magnetic turbulence description of the galactic ISM. (abridged)

 Context. Sensitive radio continuum data could remove the difference between the number of known supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galaxy compared to that expected, but due to confusion in the Galactic plane, faint SNRs can be challenging to distinguish from brighter HII regions and filamentary radio emission. Aims. We wish to exploit new SARAO MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) radio continuum data, which covers $251\deg \le l \le 358\deg$ and $2\deg \le l \le 61\deg$ at $\|b\|\le 1.5\deg$, to search for SNR candidates in the Milky Way disk. Methods. We also use MIR data from the Spitzer GLIMPSE, Spitzer MIPSGAL, and WISE surveys to help identify SNR candidates. The identified SNR candidate are sources of extended radio continuum emission that lack MIR counterparts, are not known as HII regions in the WISE Catalog of Galactic HII Regions, and are not known previously as SNRs Results. We locate 237 new Galactic SNR candidates in the SMGPS data. We also identify and confirm the expected radio morphology for 201 objects listed in the literature as being SNRs and 130 previously-identified SNR candidates. The known and candidate SNRs have similar spatial distributions and angular sizes. Conclusions. The SMGPS data allowed us to identify a large population of SNR candidates that can be confirmed as true SNRs using radio polarization measurements or by deriving radio spectral indices. If the 237 candidates are confirmed as true SNRs, it would approximately double the number of known Galactic SNRs in the survey area, alleviating much of the difference between the known and expected populations.

2024-09-25, **He-accreting oxygen-neon white dwarfs and accretion-induced collapse events**, Zhengyang Zhang et.al., [2409.16588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16588v1)

 It has been widely accepted that mass-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) are the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae or electron-capture supernovae. Previous work has shown that the accretion rate could affect the elemental abundance on the outer layers of CO WDs, and therefore affect the observational characteristics after they exploded as SNe Ia. However, it has not been well studied how elemental abundance changes on the outer layers of He-accreting ONe WDs as they approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit. In this paper, we investigated the evolution of He-accreting ONe WDs with MESA. We found that a CO-rich mantle will accumulate beneath the He layers resulting from the He burning, after which the ignition of the CO-rich mantle could transform carbon into silicon (Si). The amount of Si produced by carbon burning is strongly anti-correlated with the accretion rate. As the ONe WD nearly approaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit (Mch) through accretion, it is likely to undergo accretion-induced collapse (AIC), resulting in the formation of the neutron star (NS).

2024-09-24, **On the explosion engine of supernovae driven by a hadron-quark phase transition**, Xu-Run Huang et.al., [2409.16189v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16189v1)

 A hadron-quark phase transition (PT) may trigger supernova explosions during stellar core collapse. However, both success and failure have occurred in previous attempts to explode dying stars via this mechanism. We systematically explore the outcomes of the PT-induced collapse of proto-compact stars (PCSs), with spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and a controlled series of hybrid equations of state. Our results reveal the dependence of successful and failed explosions on the PT and quark matter characteristics. A small portion ($\sim\!0.04\%\!-\!1\%$) of the released binding energy $\Delta E\_B$ transforms into the diagnostic explosion energy $E\_{\rm exp,diag}$, which saturates at $\sim\!6\times10^{51}\,\rm{erg}$ near the black hole formation. We draw the phase diagrams for the possible fates of supernova explosions driven by hadron-quark PTs, where the control parameters are the onset density, energy gap of the PT, and the quark matter speed of sound. Our findings can be used to guide further investigations on PT-driven core-collapse supernovae and help identify hadron-quark PT-induced PCS collapse from future observations.

2024-09-24, **Pulsar wind nebulae meeting the circumstellar medium of their progenitors**, D. M. A. Meyer et.al., [2409.15829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15829v1)

 A significative fraction of high mass stars sail away through the interstellar medium of the galaxies. Once they evolved and died via a core collapse supernova, a magnetized, rotating neutron star (a pulsar) is usually their leftover. The immediate surroundings of the pulsar is the pulsar wind, which forms a nebula whose morphology is shaped by the supernova ejecta, channeled into the circumstellar medium of the progenitor star in the pre supernova time. Consequently, irregular pulsar wind nebulae display a large variety of radio appearances, screened by their interacting supernova blast wave or harboring asymmetric up down emission. Here, we present a series of 2.5 dimensional non relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations exploring the evolution of the pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) generated by a red supergiant and a Wolf Rayet massive supernova progenitors, moving with Mach number M eq. to 1 and M eq. to 2 into the warm phase of the galactic plane. In such a simplified approach, the progenitors direction of motion, the local ambient medium magnetic field, the progenitor and pulsar axis of rotation, are all aligned, which restrict our study to peculiar pulsar wind nebula of high equatorial energy flux. We found that the reverberation of the termination shock of the pulsar wind nebulae, when sufficiently embedded into its dead stellar surroundings and interacting with the supernova ejecta, is asymmetric and differs greatly as a function of the past circumstellar evolution of its progenitor, which reflects into their projected radio synchrotron emission. This mechanism is particularly at work in the context of remnants involving slowly moving or very massive stars. We find that the mixing of material in plerionic core collapse supernova remnants is strongly affected by the asymmetric reverberation in their pulsar wind nebulae.
