2025-01-27, **Neutrino reheating predictions with non-thermal leptogenesis**, Xinyi Zhang et.al., [2501.16114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16114v1)

 Connecting inflation with neutrino physics through non-thermal leptogenesis via direct inflaton-right-handed neutrino (RHN) coupling naturally incorporates neutrino reheating, leaving no ambiguity regarding the early history of the Universe. In ref.~\cite{Zhang:2023oyo}, we demonstrate that non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decay expands the viable parameter space compared to thermal leptogenesis and provides a natural link to inflation. In this work, we refine our previous findings by closely examining the dynamics of neutrino reheating. We first calculate the duration of neutrino reheating on a general basis, then analyze inflationary observables consistent with neutrino reheating across four models, establishing a direct connection between baryon asymmetry and the spectral index. This approach places these two important observables on the same plane and yields specific predictions that help break the degeneracy among inflationary models. The well-motivated and economical framework offers a simple, natural, and testable description of the early Universe.

2025-01-27, **The Signals of the Doomsday**, Amartya Sengupta et.al., [2501.15848v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15848v1)

 The measured standard model parameters indicate that we might live in a false Higgs vacuum, possibly with a very long lifetime. However, small black holes can serve as catalysers and significantly speed up the phase transition. In fact, bubbles of true vacuum might already exist in our universe. We calculate the spectrum of Higgs particles produced by such a bubble, and use event generators to study their decay and subsequent evolution of the decay products to obtain the spectrum of emitted photons and neutrinos as a long-range signature. If the propagation of the bubble walls slows down due to interaction with the surrounding matter and plasma, these signals can reach us before the bubble wall hits us, thus representing the signals of the doomsday.

 We study a non-holomorphic modular $S\_3$ flavor symmetry in which we analyze neutrino sector, dark matter, and lepton flavor violations. The active neutrino mass is generated via one-loop level. We achieve chi-square analysis and demonstrate some predictions in cases of normal hierarchy with fermionic or bosonic dark matter and inverted hierarchy of fermionic or bosonic dark matter.

2025-01-27, **A MARVEL-ous study of how well galaxy shapes reflect Dark Matter halo shapes in Cold Dark Matter Simulations**, Blake Keith et.al., [2501.16317v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16317v1)

 We present a 3D shape analysis of both dark matter (DM) and stellar matter (SM) in simulated dwarf galaxies to determine whether stellar shape traces DM shape. Using 80 central and satellite galaxies from three simulation suites (Marvelous Massive Dwarfs, Marvelous Dwarfs, and DC Justice League) spanning stellar masses of $10^6$--$10^{10}$ M$\_\odot$, we measure 3D shapes through the moment of inertia tensor at two times the effective radius to derive axis ratios ($C/A$, $B/A$) and triaxiality. We find that stellar shape does indeed follow DM halo shape for our dwarf galaxies. However, the presence of a stellar disk in more massive dwarfs (M$\_* \gtrsim 10^{7.5}$ M$\_\odot$) pulls the distribution of stellar $C/A$ ratios to lower values, while in lower mass galaxies the gravitational potential remains predominantly shaped by DM. Similarly, stellar triaxiality generally tracks dark matter halo triaxiality, with this relationship being particularly strong for non-disky galaxies though weaker in disky systems. This correlation is reinforced by strong alignment between SM and DM axes, particularly in disk galaxies. Further, we find no detectable difference in either SM or DM shape comparing two different SNe feedback implementations, demonstrating that shape measurements may be robust to different implementations of baryonic feedback in dwarf galaxies. We also observe that a dwarf galaxy's shape is largely unperturbed by recent mergers (with merger ratios $>4$). This comprehensive study demonstrates that stellar shape measurements can serve as a reliable tool for inferring DM shapes in dwarf galaxies.

2025-01-27, **Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): Exploring the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra-I cluster II. Stellar kinematics and dynamical masses**, Chiara Buttitta et.al., [2501.16190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16190v1)

 Context: This paper focuses on a class of galaxies characterised by an extremely low surface brightness: the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We used new integral-field spectroscopic data from the ESO Large Programme Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS) project. Aims: Our main goals are addressing the formation channels and investigating possible correlations of their observational properties. In particular, we derive their stellar kinematics and dynamical properties. Methods: We extract the 1D stacked spectrum inside the effective radius to obtain an unbiased measure of $\sigma\_{\rm eff}$. To derive the spatially-resolved stellar kinematics, we first apply the Voronoi tessellation algorithm to bin the spaxels in the datacube and then follow the same prescription adopted for the 1D case. In addition, we extract the velocity profiles along the galaxy's major and minor axes. Results: We find that 7 out of 18 UDGs in LEWIS show a mild rotation, 5 do not have evidence of any rotation, and the remaining 6 UDGs are unconstrained cases. This is the first large census of velocity profiles for UDGs. On average, UDGs in LEWIS are characterised by low values of $\sigma\_{\rm eff}$, comparable with available values from the literature. In the Faber-Jackson relation plane, we found a group of UDGs consistent with the relation within the errorbars, whereas outliers are objects with non-negligible rotation components. UDGs and LSBs in LEWIS have larger dark matter content than dwarf galaxies with similar total luminosity. We do not find clear correlations between the derived properties and the local environment. Conclusions: Based on the stellar kinematics, two classes of UDGs are found in the Hydra I cluster: the rotating and non-rotating systems. This result, combined with other structural properties, can help to discriminate between the several formation scenarios proposed for UDGs.

2025-01-27, **Measuring the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation at $\sim10^{10}$ Solar masses, using space-based imaging of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses**, Kaihao Wang et.al., [2501.16139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16139v1)

 The stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) embodies the joint evolution of galaxies and their host dark matter halos. However, the relation is poorly constrained at sub-galactic masses, because the stellar emission from such objects is so faint. However, it is possible to directly detect the mass of halos along the line of sight to a strong gravitational lens, when they perturb one of its multiple images. Space telescopes including Euclid, CSST, and Roman will soon discover millions of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing systems. We simulate Euclid-like imaging of a typical lens galaxy, and find that a lensing reconstruction is sensitive to $3\times10^{10}$ subhalos with various positions and concentrations, at statistical signficance $>$$3.6\sigma$. The subhalo mass can be measured without bias, provided the model simultaneously fits light from both the main lens and the subhalo. A future sample of 48 subhalos with $\geqslant$$5\sigma$ detection significance would constrain the SHMR at this mass range with $1\sigma$ uncertainty of 0.045 dex: distinguishing between different theoretical predictions at the sub-galactic scale. Follow-up spectroscopy is needed to measure lens and source redshifts; follow-up imaging at greater spatial resolution and depth would substantially improve the measurement, and eliminate false-positives at even lower halo masses.

2025-01-27, **Quasinormal Ringing and Shadows of Black Holes and Wormholes in Dark Matter-Inspired Weyl Gravity**, R. A. Konoplya et.al., [2501.16134v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16134v1)

 Weyl gravity naturally generates effective dark matter and cosmological constant terms as integration constants, eliminating the need to explicitly introduce them into the theory. Additionally, the framework permits three intriguing solutions for compact objects: an asymptotically de Sitter Schwarzschild-like black hole described by the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, a non-Schwarzschild black hole, and a traversable wormhole that exists without exotic matter. In this work, we investigate the quasinormal spectra of all three solutions.   We demonstrate that when the mass of the black hole corresponding to the Mannheim-Kazanas solution approaches zero, the perturbation equations yield an exact solution expressible through hypergeometric functions. The quasinormal modes of black holes in Weyl gravity can be classified into three distinct branches: Schwarzschild-like modes modified by effective dark matter and cosmological terms, and modes associated with empty spacetime (de Sitter and dark matter branches), which are further influenced by the black hole mass. Previous studies have shown that the dark matter term induces a secondary stage of quasinormal ringing following the initial Schwarzschild phase. Here, we compute the frequencies using convergent methods and elucidate how this unique time-domain behavior translates into the frequency domain.   Furthermore, we demonstrate that the non-Schwarzschild black hole can be distinguished from both the Schwarzschild-like solution and the wormhole through their distinct quasinormal spectra. We also compute shadow radii for black holes and wormholes within Weyl gravity, revealing that wormholes with large throat radii can produce significantly smaller shadows compared to black holes of equivalent mass.

2025-01-27, **Search for H2 cloudlets in our backyard**, A. V. Popkova et.al., [2501.16109v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16109v1)

 Several observational lines of evidence imply that a fraction of the dark matter in the Galaxy may be comprised of small cold clouds of molecular hydrogen. Such objects are difficult to detect because of their small size and low temperature, but they can reveal themselves with gamma radiation arising in interactions between such clouds and cosmic rays or as dark shadows cast on the optical, UV and X-ray sky background. In our work we use the data of Fermi LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalogue of gamma-ray sources together with the data of GALEX UV All-Sky Survey to search for small dark clouds of molecular hydrogen in the Solar neighbourhood. This approach allows us to put an upper limit on the local concentration of such objects: $n < 2.2 \times 10^{-11} {\mathrm{AU}^{-3}}$. Constraints (upper limits) on the total amount of matter in this form bound to the Sun strongly depend on the radial profile of the clouds' distribution and reside in $0.05-30~M\_{\odot}$ mass range.

2025-01-27, **Axion-like Particle Conversion in the Solar Magnetic Field**, Elisa Todarello et.al., [2501.15960v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15960v1)

 Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical extensions of the Standard Model, can convert into photons in an external magnetic field. Two recent studies~\cite{Todarello:2023ptf, Ruz:2024gkl} explored the phenomenology of ALP-photon conversion in the magnetic field of the solar atmosphere. Dark matter ALPs convert into radio photons and may be detected with next-generation radio interferometers, while ALPs produced in the solar core convert into X-rays. Thanks to solar observation acquired with the NuSTAR X-ray telescope, Ref.~\cite{Ruz:2024gkl} establishes stringent robust bounds on the ALP-photon coupling over a large portion of parameter space.

2025-01-27, **TiDES: The 4MOST Time Domain Extragalactic Survey**, C. Frohmaier et.al., [2501.16311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16311v1)

 The Time Domain Extragalactic Survey (TiDES) conducted on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) will perform spectroscopic follow-up of extragalactic transients discovered in the era of the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. TiDES will conduct a 5-year survey, covering ${>}14\,000\,\mathrm{square\, degrees}$, and use around 250 000 fibre hours to address three main science goals: (i) spectroscopic observations of ${>}30 000$ live transients, (ii) comprehensive follow-up of ${>}200 000$ host galaxies to obtain redshift measurements, and (iii) repeat spectroscopic observations of Active Galactic Nuclei to enable reverberation mapping studies. The live spectra from TiDES will be used to reveal the diversity and astrophysics of both normal and exotic supernovae across the luminosity-timescale plane. The extensive host-galaxy redshift campaign will allow exploitation of the larger sample of supernovae and improve photometric classification, providing the largest-ever sample of spec-confirmed type Ia supernovae, capable of a sub-2 per cent measurement of the equation-of-state of dark energy. Finally, the TiDES reverberation mapping experiment of 700--1\,000 AGN will complement the SN Ia sample and extend the Hubble diagram to $z\sim2.5$

2025-01-27, **The Observed Luminosity Correlations of Gamma-Ray Bursts and Their Applications**, Chen Deng et.al., [2501.16058v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16058v1)

 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most luminous electromagnetic transients in the universe, providing unique insights into extreme astrophysical processes and serving as promising probes for cosmology. Unlike Type Ia supernovae, which have a unified explosion mechanism, GRBs cannot directly act as standard candles for tracing cosmic evolution at high redshifts due to significant uncertainties in their underlying physical origins. Empirical correlations derived from statistical analyses involving various GRB parameters provide valuable information regarding their intrinsic properties. In this brief review, we describe various correlations among GRB parameters involving the prompt and afterglow phases, discussing possible theoretical interpretations behind them. The scarcity of low-redshift GRBs poses a major obstacle to the application of GRB empirical correlations in cosmology, referred to as the circularity problem. We present various efforts aiming at calibrating GRBs to address this challenge and leveraging established empirical correlations to constrain cosmological parameters. The pivotal role of GRB sample quality in advancing cosmological research is underscored. Some correlations that could potentially be utilized as redshift indicators are also introduced.

2025-01-27, **Using Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy to simultaneously alleviate the $H_{0}$ and $σ_{8}$ tensions**, Stylianos A. Tsilioukas et.al., [2501.15927v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15927v1)

 We present how Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy can alleviate $H\_{0}$ and $\sigma 8$ tensions simultaneously. This modified cosmological scenario is obtained by applying the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture to the Universe apparent horizon, employing the Wald-Gauss-Bonnet entropy instead of the standard Bekenstein Hawking one. Therefore, the modified Friedmann equations and the effective dark energy depend on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant and on measured astrophysical parameters such as the black-hole formation rate and the black-hole progenitors average mass. Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy exhibits phantom behavior at intermediate redshifts for positive coupling constants, which is known to be a sufficient mechanism that can lead to the $H\_{0}$ tension alleviation. Indeed, we show that for particular regions of the parameter space the scenario at hand does lead to higher $H\_{0}$ values, and we verify this result performing a confrontation with observational data from Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) measurements. Additionally, analyzing the growth of structures and the evolution of the matter overdensity we show that the redshift behavior of the $f\sigma\_{8}$ observable obtains smaller values than the ones arising in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and thus the scenario at hand can alleviate the $\sigma\_{8}$ tension too. This is an advantage of Wald-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology, since the simultaneous alleviation of both tensions cannot be easily achieved within other entropic scenarios.
