2024-03-05, **On the (non-)degeneracy of massive neutrinos and elastic interactions in the dark sector**, Jose Beltrán Jiménez et.al., [2403.03216v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03216v1)

 Cosmological models featuring an elastic interaction in the dark sector at linear order has been shown to provide a promising scenario for alleviating the $\sigma\_8$ tension. A natural question for these scenarios is whether there could be a degeneracy between the interaction and massive neutrinos that also contribute to erasing structures at late times. In this work we investigate the presence of such a degeneracy and show that the two effects do not exhibit strong correlations.

2024-03-05, **Thomas K. Gaisser, a Pioneer of Particle Astrophysics**, Francis Halzen et.al., [2403.03207v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03207v1)

 We describe the pioneering contributions of Thomas K. Gaisser to the birth and development of particle astrophysics, a new field of research at the intersection of cosmic ray physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and particle physics that has emerged in the last few decades. We will especially focus on his studies of natural beams of neutrinos: those generated by the interactions of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere and those emitted by astrophysical sources. Tom actively participated in the discovery of these cosmic neutrinos as well. His contributions also extend to gamma-ray astronomy, the study of the cosmic ray spectra and composition, and the modeling of cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere and in astrophysical environments. Tom invariably focused his research on the theoretical and phenomenological problems of greatest interest at the time, producing frameworks that transparently interpreted often complex data. These studies have been very influential and have shaped the development of the field.

2024-03-05, **The Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit for Neutrino and Dark Matter Experiments**, Yuyi Wang et.al., [2403.03156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03156v1)

 Photomultiplier tubes (PMT) are widely deployed at neutrino and dark matter experiments for photon counting. When multiple photons hit a PMT consecutively, their photo-electron (PE) pulses pile up to hinder the precise measurements of the count and timings. We introduce Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit (FSMP) to analyze the PMT signal waveforms into individual PEs with the strategy of reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate that FSMP improves the energy and time resolution of PMT-based experiments, gains acceleration on GPUs and is extensible to microchannel-plate (MCP) PMTs with jumbo-charge outputs. In the condition of our laboratory characterization of 8-inch MCP-PMTs, FSMP improves the energy resolution by up to 12% from the long-serving method of waveform integration.

2024-03-05, **The Density of Relic Neutrinos Near the Surface of Earth**, Andrei Gruzinov et.al., [2403.03152v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03152v2)

 It has been claimed that matter effects cause an asymmetry in the density of relic neutrinos versus antineutrinos near the surface of Earth, of order $O(G\_F^{1/2})\sim 10^{-4}$, with the vertical extent $\sim 10$m. We argue that the effect is of order $O(G\_F)\sim 10^{-8}$, with the vertical extent $\sim 1$mm.

2024-03-05, **Understanding gravitationally induced decoherence parameters in neutrino oscillations using a microscopic quantum mechanical model**, Alba Domi et.al., [2403.03106v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03106v2)

 In this work, a microscopic quantum mechanical model for gravitationally induced decoherence introduced by Blencowe and Xu is investigated in the context of neutrino oscillations. The focus is on the comparison with existing phenomenological models and the physical interpretation of the decoherence parameters in such models. The results show that for neutrino oscillations in vacuum gravitationally induced decoherence can be matched with phenomenological models with decoherence parameters of the form $\Gamma\_{ij}\sim \Delta m^4\_{ij}E^{-2}$. When matter effects are included, the decoherence parameters show a dependence on matter effects, which vary in the different layers of the Earth, that can be explained with the form of the coupling between neutrinos and the gravitational wave environment inspired by linearised gravity. Consequently, in the case of neutrino oscillations in matter, the microscopic model does not agree with many existing phenomenological models that assume constant decoherence parameters in matter, and their existing bounds cannot be used to further constrain the model considered here. The probabilities for neutrino oscillations with constant and varying decoherence parameters are compared and it is shown that the deviations can be up to 10%. On a theoretical level, these different models can be characterised by a different choice of Lindblad operators, with the model with decoherence parameters that do not include matter effects being less suitable from the point of view of linearised gravity.

2024-03-05, **Front-end electronics development of large-area SiPM arrays for high-precision single-photon time measurement**, Wei Zhi et.al., [2403.02948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02948v1)

 TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT) plans to incorporate silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) with superior time resolution in addition to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) into its detection units, namely hybrid Optical Digital Modules (hDOMs), to improve its angular resolution.   However, the time resolution significantly degrades for large-area SiPMs due to the increased parasitic capacitance, posing significant challenges for the readout electronics of SiPMs in hDOM.   We designed the front-end readout electronics for large-area SiPM arrays dedicated to high-precision time measurements, which consists of a high-speed pre-amplifier based on transformers (MABA-007159) and radio frequency (RF) amplifiers (BGA2803), a series-parallel combination SiPM array with reduced capacitance, and an analog multi-channel summing circuit.   We measured the single photon time resolution (SPTR) of a $4\times4$ SiPM (Hamamatsu S13360-3050PE) array ($12\times12~\mathrm{mm}^2$) of approximately 300 ps FWHM with a power consumption of less than 100 mW.   This front-end readout design enables the large-area SiPM array to achieve high-precision SPTR with low power consumption.

2024-03-05, **Rare $B$ and $K$ decays in a scotogenic model**, Chuan-Hung Chen et.al., [2403.02897v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02897v1)

 A scotogenic model can radiatively generate the observed neutrino mass, provide a dark matter candidate, and lead to rare lepton flavor-violating processes. We aim to extend the model to establish a potential connection to the quark flavor-related processes within the framework of scotogenesis, enhancing the unexpectedly large branching ratio (BR) of $B^+\to K^+ \nu \bar\nu$, observed by Belle II Collaboration. Meanwhile, the model can address tensions between some experimental measurements and standard model (SM) predictions in flavor physics, such as the muon $g-2$ excess and the higher BR of $B\_s \to \mu^- \mu^+$. We introduce in the model the following dark particles: a neutral singlet Dirac-type lepton ($N$); two inert Higgs doublets ($\eta\_{1,2}$), with one of which carrying a lepton number; a charged singlet dark scalar $(\chi^+)$, and a singlet vector-like up-type dark quark ($T$). The first two entities are responsible for the radiative neutrino mass, and $\chi^+$ couples to right-handed quarks and leptons and can resolve the tensions existing in muon $g-2$ and $B\_s\to \mu^- \mu^+$. Furthermore, the BR of $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar\nu$ can be enhanced up to a factor of 2 compared to the SM prediction through the mediations of the dark $T$ and the charged scalars. In addition, we also study the impacts on the $K\to \pi \nu \bar\nu$ decays.

2024-03-05, **Macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay: long range quantum coherence**, Gordon Baym et.al., [2403.02602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02602v1)

 We introduce the concept of ``macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay" (MDBD) for Majorana neutrinos. In this process an antineutrino produced by a nucleus undergoing beta decay, $X \to Y + e^- + \bar \nu\_e$, is absorbed as a neutrino by another identical $X$ nucleus via the inverse beta decay reaction, $\nu\_e + X \to e^-+Y$. The distinct signature of MDBD is that the total kinetic energy of the two electrons equals twice the endpoint energy of single beta decay. The amplitude for MDBD, a coherent sum over the contribution of different mass states of the intermediate neutrinos, reflects quantum coherence over macroscopic distances, and is a new macroscopic quantum effect. We evaluate the rate of MDBD for a macroscopic sample of ``$X$" material, e.g., tritium, acting both as the source and the target. The accidental background for MDBD originating from two separate single beta decays, which contains two final state neutrinos, can be readily rejected by measuring the energy of the detected two electrons. We discuss the similarities and differences between the MDBD and conventional neutrinoless double beta decay.

2024-03-05, **How much information can be extracted from galaxy clustering at the field level?**, Nhat-Minh Nguyen et.al., [2403.03220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03220v1)

 We present optimal Bayesian field-level cosmological constraints from nonlinear tracers of the large-scale structure, specifically the amplitude $\sigma\_8$ of linear matter fluctuations inferred from rest-frame simulated dark matter halos in a comoving volume of $8\,(h^{-1}\mathrm{Gpc})^3$. Our constraint on $\sigma\_8$ is entirely due to nonlinear information, and obtained by explicitly sampling the initial conditions along with bias and noise parameters via a Lagrangian EFT-based forward model, LEFTfield. The comparison with a simulation-based inference analysis employing the power spectrum and bispectrum likewise using the LEFTfield forward model shows that, when including precisely the same modes of the same data up to $k\_{\mathrm{max}}= 0.10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ ($0.12\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), the field-level approach yields a factor of 1.7 (2.6) improvement on the $\sigma\_8$ constraint, from 9.9% to 5.8% (9.4% to 3.6%). This study provides the first direct insights into cosmological information encoded in galaxy clustering beyond low-order $n$-point functions.

2024-03-05, **Probing Recoil Signatures of Inelastic Dark Matter**, Hong-Jian He et.al., [2403.03128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03128v1)

 Different dark matter (DM) candidates could have different types of DM-lepton and/or DM-quark interactions. For direct detection experiments, this leads to diversity in the recoil spectra, where both DM-electron and DM-nucleus scatterings may contribute. Furthermore, kinematic effects such as those of the inelastic scattering can also play an important role in shaping the recoil spectra. In this work, we systematically study signatures of the light exothermic inelastic DM from the recoil spectra including both the DM-electron scattering and Migdal effect. Such inelastic DM has mass around (sub-)GeV scale and the DM mass-splitting ranges from 1keV to 30keV. We analyze the direct detection sensitivities to such light inelastic DM. For different inelastic DM masses and mass-splittings, we find that the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect can contribute significantly and differently to the direct detection signatures. Hence, it is important to perform combined analysis to include both the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect. We further demonstrate that this analysis has strong impacts on the cosmological and laboratory bounds for the inelastic DM.

2024-03-05, **Ultralight vector dark matter search using data from the KAGRA O3GK run**, The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et.al., [2403.03004v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03004v1)

 Among the various candidates for dark matter (DM), ultralight vector DM can be probed by laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors through the measurement of oscillating length changes in the arm cavities. In this context, KAGRA has a unique feature due to differing compositions of its mirrors, enhancing the signal of vector DM in the length change in the auxiliary channels. Here we present the result of a search for $U(1)\_{B-L}$ gauge boson DM using the KAGRA data from auxiliary length channels during the first joint observation run together with GEO600. By applying our search pipeline, which takes into account the stochastic nature of ultralight DM, upper bounds on the coupling strength between the $U(1)\_{B-L}$ gauge boson and ordinary matter are obtained for a range of DM masses. While our constraints are less stringent than those derived from previous experiments, this study demonstrates the applicability of our method to the lower-mass vector DM search, which is made difficult in this measurement by the short observation time compared to the auto-correlation time scale of DM.

2024-03-05, **The Future of Primordial Black Holes: Open Questions and Roadmap**, Antonio Riotto et.al., [2403.02907v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02907v1)

 We discuss some of the the open questions and the roadmap in the physics of primordial black holes. Black holes are the only dark matter candidate that is known to actually exit. Their conjectured primordial role is admittedly based on hypothesis rather than fact, most straightforwardly as a simple extension to the standard models of inflation, or even, in homage to quantum physics, more controversially via a slowing-down of Hawking evaporation. Regardless of one's stance on the theoretical basis for their existence, the possibility of primordial black holes playing a novel role in dark matter physics and gravitational wave astronomy opens up a rich astrophysical phenomenology that we lay out in this brief overview.

2024-03-05, **Primordial black hole formation processes with full numerical relativity**, Eloy de Jong et.al., [2403.02878v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02878v1)

 See thesis for complete abstract.   Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form in the early universe, and there are several mass windows in which their abundance today may be large enough to comprise a significant part of the dark matter density. Additionally, numerical relativity (NR) allows one to investigate the formation processes of PBHs in the fully nonlinear strong-gravity regime. In this thesis, we will describe the use of NR methods to study PBH formation, motivated in particular by open questions about the nonspherical effects PBH formation in a matter-dominated early universe.   We demonstrate that superhorizon non-linear perturbations can collapse and form PBHs via the direct collapse or the accretion collapse mechanisms in a matter-dominated universe. The heaviest perturbations collapse via the direct collapse mechanism, while lighter perturbations trigger an accretion process that causes a rapid collapse of the ambient DM. From the hoop conjecture we propose an analytic criterion to determine whether a given perturbation will collapse via the direct or accretion mechanism and we compute the timescale of collapse. Independent of the formation mechanism, the PBH forms within an efold after collapse is initiated and with a small initial mass compared to the Hubble horizon, $M\_\textrm{BH} H\_0\sim 10^{-2}m\_\mathrm{Pl}^2$. Finally, we find that PBH formation is followed by extremely rapid growth $M\_\textrm{BH}\propto H^{-\beta}$ with $\beta\gg 1$, during which the PBH acquires most of its mass.   Furthermore, we study the formation of spinning primordial black holes during an early matter-dominated era. Using non-linear 3+1D general relativistic simulations, we compute the efficiency of mass and angular momentum transfer in the process -- which we find to be $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$.   Abstract continues in thesis.

2024-03-05, **Simulations of galaxies in an expanding Universe with modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and with modified gravitational attractions (MOGA)**, Søren Toxvaerd et.al., [2403.02848v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02848v1)

 The stability of galaxies is either explained by the existence of dark matter or caused by a modification of Newtonian acceleration (MOND). Here we show that the modification of the Newtonian dynamics can equally well be obtained by a modification of Newton's law of universal gravitational attraction (MOGA), by which an inverse square attraction from a distant object is replaced with an inverse attraction. This modification is often proposed in the standard model, and with the modification of the attraction caused by dark matter. The recently derived algorithm, Eur. Phys. J. Plus 137, 99 (2022); Class. Quantum Grav. 39, 225006 (2022), for classical celestial dynamics is used to simulate models of the Milky Way in an expanding universe and with either MOND or MOGA. The simulations show that the galaxies with MOND dynamics are unstable whereas MOGA stabilizes the galaxies. The rotation velocities for objects in galaxies with classical Newtonian dynamics decline inversely proportional to the square root of the distance $r$ to the galaxy's center. However, the rotation velocities are relatively independent of $r$ for MOGA and qualitatively in agreement with experimentally determined rotation curves for galaxies in the Universe. The modification of the attractions may be caused by the masses of the objects in the central part of the galaxy by the lensing of gravitational waves from far-away objects in the galaxy.

2024-03-05, **Differential cross-sections for events with missing transverse momentum and jets measured with the ATLAS detector in 13 TeV proton-proton collisions**, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., [2403.02793v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02793v1)

 Measurements of inclusive, differential cross-sections for the production of events with missing transverse momentum in association with jets in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV are presented. The measurements are made with the ATLAS detector using an integrated luminosity of 140~fb$^{-1}$ and include measurements of dijet distributions in a region in which vector-boson fusion processes are enhanced. They are unfolded to correct for detector resolution and efficiency within the fiducial acceptance, and are designed to allow robust comparisons with a wide range of theoretical predictions. A measurement of differential cross sections for the $Z~\to \nu\nu$ process is made. The measurements are generally well-described by Standard Model predictions except for the dijet invariant mass distribution. Auxiliary measurements of the hadronic system recoiling against isolated leptons, and photons, are also made in the same phase space. Ratios between the measured distributions are then derived, to take advantage of cancellations in modelling effects and some of the major systematic uncertainties. These measurements are sensitive to new phenomena, and provide a mechanism to easily set constraints on phenomenological models. To illustrate the robustness of the approach, these ratios are compared with two common Dark Matter models, where the constraints derived from the measurement are comparable to those set by dedicated detector-level searches.

2024-03-05, **Light Thermal Dark Matter Beyond $p$-Wave Annihilation in Minimal Higgs Portal Model**, Yu-Tong Chen et.al., [2403.02721v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02721v1)

 This study explores a minimal renormalizable dark matter (DM) model, incorporating a sub-GeV Majorana DM and a singlet scalar particle $\phi$. Using scalar and pseudo-scalar interactions (couplings $c\_s$ and $c\_p$), we investigate implications for DM detection, considering $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and combined ($s$+$p$ wave) contributions in DM annihilation cross-section, as well as loop-correction contributions to DM-nucleon elastic scattering. Identifying a broad parameter space ($10 \,\rm{MeV} < m\_\chi \lesssim m\_\phi$) within the $2\sigma$ allowed region, we explore scenarios ($\left\|c\_s\right\|\gg \left\|c\_p\right\|$, $\left\|c\_s\right\|\ll \left\|c\_p\right\|$, and $\left\|c\_s\right\|\approx \left\|c\_p\right\|$). We find that (i) a non-zero pseudo-scalar coupling alleviates direct detection constraints as a comparison with the previous pure scalar coupling case; (ii) CMB observations set stringent limits on pseudo-scalar interaction dominant cases, making $s$-wave annihilation viable only for $m\_\chi>1\,\rm{GeV}$; (iii) the preferred $\phi$-resonance region can be tested in the future indirect detection experiments, such as e-ASTROGAM.

2024-03-05, **Limits on scalar dark matter interactions from radiative corrections**, V. V. Flambaum et.al., [2403.02685v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02685v1)

 There is limited information about interaction strength of scalar dark matter candidate with hadrons and leptons for scalar particle mass exceeding $10^{-3}$ eV while its interaction with photon is well-studied. The scalar-photon coupling constant receives quantum corrections from one-loop Feynman diagrams which involve the scalar-lepton, scalar-quark and scalar-W boson vertices. We calculate these one-loop quantum corrections and find new limits on the scalar particle interactions with electron, muon, tau, quarks, nucleons, gluons and W boson for $m\_{\phi}<15$ MeV by re-purposing the results of experiments measuring the scalar-photon interaction. Limits on interactions with heavy leptons and quarks have been obtained for the first time, limits on other interactions in certain mass intervals are 2 to 15 orders of magnitude stronger than those presented in previous publications.

2024-03-05, **Effect of dark matter on the shadow of a distorted and deformed compact object**, Shokoufe Faraji et.al., [2403.02597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02597v1)

 This work investigates observational properties, namely the shadow and photon ring structure, of emission profiles originated near compact objects. In particular, we consider a distorted and deformed compact object characterized by quadrupoles and surrounded by an optically thin and geometrically thin accretion disk with different emission profiles modeled by the Johnson's Standard-Unbound (SU) distribution in the reference frame of the emitter. Under these assumptions, we produce the observed intensity profiles and shadow images for a face-on observer. Our results indicate that, due to the fact that modifications of the quadrupole parameters affect the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the photon sphere (PS), the observed shadow images and their properties are significantly influenced by the quadrupole parameters and emission profiles. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of the presence of a dark matter halo in the observational imprints considered and verify that both the increase in the matter contained in the halo or decrease in the length-scale of the halo lead to an increase in the size of the observed shadow. Our results indicate potential degeneracies between the observational features of distorded and deformed compact objects with those of spherically symmetric blackholes, which could be assessed by a comparison with the current and future generation of optical experiments in gravitational physics.

2024-03-05, **CLEAN algorithm implementation comparisons between popular software packages**, Daniel Wright et.al., [2403.03091v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03091v1)

 The CLEAN algorithm, first published by H\"{o}gbom and its later variants such as Multiscale CLEAN (msCLEAN) by Cornwell, has been the most popular tool for deconvolution in radio astronomy. Interferometric imaging used in aperture synthesis radio telescopes requires deconvolution for removal of the telescopes point spread function from the observed images. We have compared source fluxes produced by different implementations of H\"{o}gbom and msCLEAN (WSCLEAN, CASA) with a prototype implementation of H\"{o}gbom and msCLEAN for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) on two datasets. First is a simulation of multiple point sources of known intensity using H\"{o}gbom, where none of the software packages detected all the simulated point sources to within 1.0% of the simulated values. The second is of supernova remnant G055.7+3.4 taken by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) using msCLEAN, where each of the software packages produced different images for the same settings.

2024-03-05, **On Cepheid distances in the $H_0$ measurement**, Richard I. Anderson et.al., [2403.02801v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02801v1)

 Classical Cepheids were the first stellar standard candles and have played a crucial role for astronomical distance measurements ever since the discovery of the Leavitt law (period-luminosity relation). Enormous improvements in distance accuracy have been achieved since Hertzsprung's first application of Leavitt's law to measure the distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud in 1913, notably in very recent years thanks to a large data set of highly accurate space astrometry from the ESA mission Gaia. Complemented by homogeneous space photometry, Cepheids enable the most accurate distance estimates to galaxies hosting type-Ia supernovae up to approximately 70 Mpc distant. Here, I review the history of Cepheid distance measurements, open questions on the side of stellar astrophysics, and recent studies seeking to quantify and mitigate systematics with a view to further improve the accuracy on the Hubble constant. For example, the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope will enhance precision due to 4x lower sensitivity to source blending in crowded regions and greater sensitivity in dust-insensitive infrared bands. Future 30m-class telescopes could in principle further improve Cepheid distance measurements towards the Hubble flow, if technical challenges related to a continuously evolving instrument can be overcome.
