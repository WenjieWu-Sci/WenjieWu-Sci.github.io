2024-08-08, **Distinguishing Beyond-Standard Model Effects in Neutrino Oscillation**, A. Calatayud-Cadenillas et.al., [2408.04234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04234v1)

 We systematically assess the DUNE experiment's ability to distinguish between various beyond-standard neutrino oscillation hypotheses pair combinations. For a pair comparison, we evaluate the statistical separation, where one hypothesis plays the role of the true signal while the other corresponds to the test signal. The beyond-standard neutrino oscillation hypotheses under scrutiny include neutrino decay (invisible and visible), non-standard interactions, quantum decoherence, and the violation of the equivalence principle. When taken as the true model, we found that either quantum decoherence or the violation of the equivalence principle are the easiest to differentiate compared to the rest of the hypotheses. Additionally, from our statistical test, we investigate potential discrepancies between the measured CP-violation phase $\delta\_{CP}$ relative to its true value, which could occur for a given comparison. In our analysis, we will take the true values of $\delta\_{CP}$ as $-90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. Notably, even in cases where the beyond-standard neutrino oscillation hypotheses scenarios are statistically indistinguishable, the measured value can exhibit significant deviations from its true value.

2024-08-08, **From Safeguards Application to Fundamental Physics: Advancements in Reactor Neutrino Detection with the ν-Angra Experiment**, E. Kemp et.al., [2408.04180v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04180v1)

 Operating on a surface with high noise rates and requiring susceptible, yet small-scale detectors, the Neutrinos-Angra detector is an excellent platform for technological development and expertise in new detection methods. This report details the primary features of the detector, the electronics involved, and preliminary physics results from the operational phase, particularly the ON-OFF analysis comparing the signals with the reactor in operation (ON) and during the maintenance shut-down (OFF), demonstrating the detector's capability to monitor reactor activity. Additionally, we will briefly discuss the prospects of using a cryogenic calorimeter to detect neutrinos via Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS), highlighting potential advancements in neutrino detection technology. Looking ahead, the project promises to play a crucial role in the integration of Latin American scientists and engineers into global scientific collaborations, significantly contributing to the LASF4RI and the broader HECAP strategic framework.

2024-08-08, **Axion production via trapped misalignment from Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking**, Luca Di Luzio et.al., [2408.04623v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04623v1)

 The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry does not need to be exact, and even a tiny source of PQ breaking not aligned with the QCD anomaly might have significant phenomenological implications. In this study, we examine the effects of a general class of PQ-breaking operators on the axion cosmological production via misalignment, focussing on both temperature-dependent and independent PQ-breaking potentials. In particular, we show that a variant of the trapped misalignment mechanism can delay the onset of axion oscillation, leading to an axion dark matter window with $m\_a \gg 10^{-5}$ eV. This scenario is testable through various experimental approaches, including standard axion haloscopes and helioscopes, as well as searches for electric dipole moments and axion-mediated forces.

2024-08-08, **An empirical background modeling tool (TweedleDEE) applied to new Milky Way satellite Leo VI**, Chance Hoskinson et.al., [2408.04611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04611v1)

 We present a computational tool, TweedleDEE, for empirically modeling diffuse gamma-ray background emission in a 1 degree region of the sky, using publicly available gamma-ray data slightly off-axis from this region. This background model allows a user to perform a purely data-driven search for anomalous localized sources of gamma-ray emission, including new physics. As an application, we use TweedleDEE and the MADHATv2 package to perform the first search for dark matter annihilation in the newly discovered Leo VI dwarf spheroidal galaxy, and present model constraints for a variety of choices of the annihilation channel and velocity dependence of the cross section.

2024-08-08, **Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $Ω_m$ and $ω_c$**, Davide Pedrotti et.al., [2408.04530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04530v1)

 The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H\_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega\_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega\_c$. We argue that once $\Omega\_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega\_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega\_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega\_b$, any model raising $H\_0$ inevitably raises $\omega\_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, the clustering parameter $S\_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega\_m$ which is as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.

2024-08-08, **Why artificial disruption is not a concern for current cosmological simulations**, Feihong He et.al., [2408.04470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04470v1)

 Recent studies suggest that cold dark matter subhalos are hard to disrupt and almost all cases of subhalo disruption observed in numerical simulations are due to numerical effects. However, these findings primarily relied on idealized numerical experiments, which do not fully capture the realistic conditions of subhalo evolution within a hierarchical cosmological context. Based on the Aquarius simulations, we identify clear segregation in the population of surviving and disrupted subhalos, which corresponds to two distinct acquisition channels of subhalos. We find that all of the first-order subhalos accreted after redshift 2 survive to the present time without suffering from artificial disruption. On the other hand, most of the disrupted subhalos are sub-subhalos accreted at high redshift. Unlike the first-order subhalos, sub-subhalos experience pre-processing and many of them are accreted through major mergers at high redshift, resulting in very high mass loss rates. We confirm these high mass loss rates are physical through both numerical experiments and semi-analytical modeling, thus supporting a physical origin for their rapid disappearance in the simulation. Even though we cannot verify whether these subhalos have fully disrupted or not, their extreme mass loss rates dictate that they can at most contribute a negligible fraction to the very low mass end of the subhalo mass function. We thus conclude that current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations have reliably resolved the subhalo population.

2024-08-08, **Effects from Dark Matter Halos on X-ray Pulsar Pulse Profiles**, Yukun Liu et.al., [2408.04425v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04425v1)

 Neutron stars (NSs) can capture dark matter (DM) particles because of their deep gravitational potential and high density. The accumulated DM can affect the properties of NSs. In this work we use a general relativistic two-fluid formalism to solve the structure of DM-admixed NSs (DANSs) and the surrounding spacetime. Specifically, we pay attention to the situation where those DANSs possess DM halos. Due to the gravitational effect of the DM halo, the pulse profile of an X-ray pulsar is changed. Our study finds a universal relation between the peak flux deviation of the pulse profile and $M\_{\rm halo}/R\_{\rm BM}$, which is the ratio of the DM halo mass, $M\_{\rm halo}$, to the baryonic matter (BM) core radius, $R\_{\rm BM}$. Our results show that, when $M\_{\rm halo}/R\_{\rm BM}=0.292$ and the DM particle mass $m\_f = 0.3\,$GeV, the maximum deviation of the profile can be larger than 100$\%$, which has implication in X-ray pulsar observation.

2024-08-08, **Exploring the Hubble tension with a late time Modified Gravity scenario**, Luis A. Escamilla et.al., [2408.04354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04354v1)

 We investigate a modified cosmological model aimed at addressing the Hubble tension, considering revised dynamics in the late Universe. The model introduces a parameter $c$ affecting the evolution equations, motivated by a modified Poisson algebra inspired by effective Loop Quantum Cosmology. Our analysis includes diverse background datasets such as Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae (with and without the SH0ES calibration), SDSS, DESY6 and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and background information of the Cosmic Microwave Background. We find that the model alleviates the Hubble tension in most of the dataset combinations, with cases reducing discrepancies to below $1\sigma$ when including SH0ES. However, the model exhibits minimal improvement in the overall fit when compared to $\Lambda$CDM, and Bayesian evidence generally favors the standard model. Theoretical foundations support this approach as a subtle adjustment to low-redshift dynamics, suggesting potential for further exploration into extensions of $\Lambda$CDM. Despite challenges in data fitting, our findings underscore the promise of small-scale modifications in reconciling cosmological tensions.
