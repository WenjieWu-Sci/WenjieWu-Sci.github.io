2026-01-05, **Joint Constraints on Neutrinos and Dynamical Dark Energy in Minimally Modified Gravity**, Artur Ladeira et.al., [2601.02077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02077v1)

 The \(w\_{\dagger}\)VCDM framework provides a theoretically well-controlled extension of \(Λ\)CDM within the class of minimally modified gravity theories, allowing for flexible cosmological background evolution and linear perturbation dynamics while remaining free of pathological instabilities. In this work, we have shown that this scenario remains robust when confronted with current cosmological observations, even in the presence of an extended neutrino sector. Combining \textit{Planck} CMB data with DESI DR2 BAO and DESY5 supernovae, we obtain stringent constraints on neutrino physics, including \(\sum m\_ν< 0.11~\mathrm{eV}\) (95\% CL) and \(N\_{\rm eff} = 2.98^{+0.13}\_{-0.14}\), fully consistent with Standard Model expectations. Crucially, the data exhibit a statistically significant preference for a late-time dark-energy transition, characterized by a robust quintessence--phantom crossing that remains stable across all dataset combinations and neutrino-sector extensions, including the presence of a sterile neutrino. The combined effects of modified late-time expansion and additional relativistic degrees of freedom systematically raise the inferred Hubble constant, substantially alleviating the \(H\_0\) tension without invoking early dark energy or introducing theoretical instabilities. Overall, the \(w\_{\dagger}\)VCDM scenario emerges as a compelling phenomenological framework that simultaneously accommodates current constraints on neutrino physics, provides an excellent fit to recent BAO and supernovae data, and offers a viable pathway toward resolving persistent tensions in the standard cosmological model.

2026-01-05, **Proton Acceleration by Collisionless Shocks in Supermassive Black Hole Coronae: Implications for High-Energy Neutrinos**, Minh Nhat Ly et.al., [2601.01999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01999v1)

 Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have revealed a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC~1068, without a corresponding flux of high-energy gamma-rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M\_s \approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($<1\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit.

2026-01-05, **Asymmetric Dark Matter from Low-Scale Spontaneous Leptogenesis**, Hiroki Takahashi et.al., [2601.01849v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01849v1)

 We investigate a novel type of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) model in which the dark matter asymmetry and the baryon asymmetry in our universe (BAU) are produced simultaneously via low-scale spontaneous leptogenesis, where the mass scale of right-handed neutrino is much lower than the Davidson-Ibarra bound $M\_1 \ll 10^{9}~\rm{GeV}$. In our scenario, both asymmetries are predominantly sourced by a dynamical $CP$ phase, namely the majoron. Its kinetic misalignment provides a sufficiently large, time-dependent effective $CP$ phase, allowing efficient asymmetry production even for low-scale right-handed neutrinos. In our framework, the sources of $CP$ violation responsible for the BAU and ADM are correlated with each other, leading to a predictive relation for the dark matter mass. In particular, when the dark matter asymmetry reaches its equilibrium value before freeze-out, the dark matter mass is typically predicted to lie in the range $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m\_χ \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)~\mathrm{GeV}$, which lies within the sensitivity of direct detection experiments. On the other hand, if the dark matter asymmetry does not reach its equilibrium value due to weak coupling, the allowed mass range extends over a broader interval, $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m\_χ \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)~\rm{TeV}$.

2026-01-04, **Overview of Neutrino-Mass Determination**, Diana S. Parno et.al., [2601.01672v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01672v1)

 This proceedings paper briefly reviews the status of direct experimental probes into the neutrino-mass scale, with an emphasis on recent results from the KATRIN experiment.

2026-01-04, **Diffuse neutrino flux from relativistic reconnection in AGN coronae**, D. Karavola et.al., [2601.01533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01533v1)

 IceCube observations point to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as promising contributors to the observed astrophysical neutrino flux. Close to the central black hole, protons can be accelerated through magnetic reconnection to very high energies and subsequently interact with abundant X-ray photons in the source, leading to neutrino production. We investigate whether the diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube can originate, via proton acceleration, in reconnection-powered coronae of non-jetted AGN. We create a library of neutrino spectral templates, over a large grid of values for the three key model parameters: the proton plasma magnetization of the corona $σ\_{\rm p}$, the X-ray coronal luminosity, and the black hole mass. Synchrotron cooling of pions and muons plays a significant role due to the large coronal magnetic fields. We couple the single-source model with a mock AGN catalog, consistent with the observed X-ray and mid-infrared AGN samples at redshifts $z=0-4$, to infer the diffuse neutrino flux. Coronal emission satisfactorily explains the most recent IceCube measurements of the diffuse neutrino flux up to energies of $\sim 1$~PeV, provided that $\sim$10\% of the AGN coronae have $σ\_{\rm p} \sim 10^5$, while the rest are distributed over a range of lower magnetizations. Coronal emission is suppressed at higher energies by pion and muon cooling, so that another population is required, with jetted AGN being strong candidates.

2026-01-04, **Cracks in the Standard Cosmological Model: Anomalies, Tensions, and Hints of New Physics**, Eleonora Di Valentino et.al., [2601.01525v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01525v1)

 Cosmology has entered an era of unprecedented precision, yet increasing accuracy has revealed cracks in the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm. Although the model remains highly successful when confronted with individual datasets, joint analyses expose a network of tensions involving the Hubble constant, CMB lensing, curvature, neutrino masses, and the nature of dark energy. In this contribution to the 3rd General Meeting of the COST Action COSMIC WISPers (CA21106), within the context of Working Group~2, we critically assess these discrepancies, emphasizing the role of model assumptions, parameter degeneracies, and dataset consistency. We review proposed early- and late-time solutions, discuss how recent DESI BAO results alter the viability of late-time extensions, and explore interacting dark-sector scenarios. Our analysis highlights the need for caution in interpreting cosmological measurements and underscores the importance of internal consistency among cosmological probes before claiming percent-level accuracy or invoking new physics.

2026-01-04, **Classifying Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational Waves using Supervised Contrastive Learning**, Ao-Bo Wang et.al., [2601.01376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01376v1)

 The detection and reconstruction of gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) present significant challenges due to the highly stochastic nature of the signals and the complexity of detector noise. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework utilizing a ResNet-50 encoder pre-trained via supervised contrastive learning to classify CCSN signals and distinguish them from instrumental noise artifacts. Our approach explicitly optimizes the feature space to maximize intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Using a simulated four-detector network (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA) and realistic datasets injecting magnetorotational and neutrino-driven waveforms, we demonstrate that the contrastive learning paradigm establishes a superior metric structure within the embedding space, significantly enhancing detection efficiency. At a false positive rate of $10^{-4}$, our method achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of nearly $100\%$ for both rotational and neutrino-driven signals within a distance range of $10$--$200$~kpc, while maintaining a TPR of approximately $80\%$ at $1200$~kpc. In contrast, traditional end-to-end methods yield a TPR below $20\%$ for rotational signals at distances $\geq 200$~kpc, and fail to exceed $60\%$ for neutrino-driven signals even at a close proximity of $10$~kpc.

2026-01-05, **Axions explain the formation of supermassive black holes at cosmic dawn**, Pierre Sikivie et.al., [2601.02321v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02321v1)

 In a recent paper we pointed out that supermassive black holes, with masses ranging from $10^5$ to $10^{10} M\_\odot$ form naturally at cosmic dawn if the dark matter is QCD axions or axion-like particles with mass $m > 10^{-16}\, \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. No additional assumptions are required. Here we answer in detail the most commonly raised questions regarding our work.

2026-01-05, **Resonant Photon-Axion Mixing Driven by Dark Matter Oscillations**, Run-Min Yao et.al., [2601.02115v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02115v1)

 Wave propagation in a coherently oscillating background is intrinsically a periodically driven problem. We show that photon propagation through an axion dark matter background in the presence of a magnetic field is governed by Floquet physics, distinct from conventional static or adiabatic mixing paradigms. Coherent photon-axion mode conversion occurs when the mismatch between the photon and axion dispersion relations is compensated by integer harmonics of the axion oscillation frequency, $Δ\_γ- Δ\_a \approx n m\_a$ ($n \in \mathbb{Z}$) with the axion mass $m\_a$, even far from the standard level-crossing condition $Δ\_γ\approx Δ\_a$. Crucially, this resonance disappears entirely if the axion oscillations are averaged over, and is therefore systematically missed in conventional static or adiabatic treatments. This driven resonance represents a unitary Floquet mode-mixing process and is fundamentally distinct from parametric instability or stimulated axion decay, preserving the axion dark matter number density. We develop a general Floquet framework for photon propagation in oscillating axion backgrounds, revealing that resonant mixing generates robust polarization effects during propagation. As an astrophysical application, we apply this mechanism to the realistic environment of the blazar 3C 279 to derive concrete constraints on the axion-photon coupling. While the observational manifestation depends on environmental conditions, the underlying driven mixing mechanism is generic to coherent axion dark matter, revealing a previously overlooked regime of photon-axion conversion.

2026-01-05, **Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto ultra dense dark matter halos and direct collapse black holes**, Kandaswamy Subramanian et.al., [2601.02104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02104v1)

 We suggest a formation scenario of black holes with intermediate mass $\sim 10^3 M\_\odot$, by post recombination Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion into ultra dense dark matter halos (UDMH) of $\sim 10^5 M\_\odot$, which have formed around the recombination epoch. Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about $\sim 8000$ K and collapses on the free fall time of few $10^4$ yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of $H\_2$ molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts $z> 200-400$. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about $10^3 M\_\odot$ at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope.

2026-01-05, **ODIN: Clustering Properties of Ly$α$ Blobs at $z$ $\sim$ 2.4 and 3.1**, Byeongha Moon et.al., [2601.01991v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01991v1)

 Spatially extended Ly$α$ nebulae, known as Ly$α$ blobs (LABs), are a rare population at $z > 2$ that are thought to trace proto-groups or the progenitors of massive galaxies in the present-day universe. However, their dark matter halo properties (e.g., halo mass) are still uncertain due to their rarity and strong field-to-field variation. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey has discovered 103 and 112 LABs in the extended ($\sim$9~\sqdeg) COSMOS field at $z\sim2.4$ and 3.1, respectively, enabling estimation of their bias and host halo masses through clustering analysis. We measure the angular auto-correlation functions (ACFs) of LABs and derive galaxy bias factors of $b$ = $4.0\pm0.8$ and $3.8\pm0.7$, corresponding to minimum halo masses of $2.8^{+3.0}\_{-1.8}$ and $0.7^{+0.8}\_{-0.5}\times10^{12}~M\_\odot$ and median halo masses of $4.2^{+3.8}\_{-2.5}$ and $1.1^{+1.1}\_{-0.7}\times10^{12}~M\_\odot$ at $z\sim2.4$ and 3.1, respectively. LABs occupy $\sim$11$^{+39}\_{-8}$\% and $\sim$3$^{+9}\_{-2}$\% of all dark matter halos above these minimum halo masses. These findings suggest that LABs inhabit massive dark matter halos, likely tracing proto-group environments that evolve into present-day massive halos ($\sim$10$^{13}~M\_\odot$), where massive elliptical galaxies or galaxy groups reside, by $z=0$.

2026-01-05, **Accelerating cosmological simulations on GPUs: a step towards sustainability and green-awareness**, Giovanni Lacopo et.al., [2601.01935v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01935v1)

 The increasing complexity and scale of cosmological N-body simulations, driven by astronomical surveys like Euclid, call for a paradigm shift towards more sustainable and energy-efficient high-performance computing (HPC). The rising energy consumption of supercomputing facilities poses a significant environmental and financial challenge.   In this work, we build upon a recently developed GPU implementation of pinocchio, a widely-used tool for the fast generation of dark matter (DM) halo catalogues, to investigate energy consumption. Using a different resource configuration, we confirmed the time-to-solution behavior observed in a companion study, and we use these runs to compare time-to-solution with energy-to-solution.   By profiling the code on various HPC platforms with a newly developed implementation of the Power Measurement Toolkit (PMT), we demonstrate an 8x reduction in energy-to-solution and 8x speed-up in time-to-solution compared to the CPU-only version. Taken together, these gains translate into an overall efficiency improvement of up to 64x. Our results show that the GPU-accelerated pinocchio not only achieves substantial speed-up, making the generation of large-scale mock catalogues more tractable, but also significantly reduces the energy footprint of the simulations. This work represents an step towards ``green-aware" scientific computing in cosmology, proving that performance and sustainability can be simultaneously achieved.

2026-01-05, **Accelerated evolution of galaxy host halo masses during Cosmic Dawn from deep JWST clustering**, Nicolò Dalmasso et.al., [2601.01697v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01697v1)

 We present the deepest clustering analysis of early galaxies to date, analyzing $N\_{\rm{g}} \simeq 6500$ photometrically-selected Lyman Break Galaxies from JWST's Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to reveal how galaxies and dark matter evolved during cosmic dawn ($5 \leq z < 11$). Using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling of the two-point angular correlation function, we trace the galaxy-halo relationships across the first billion years of cosmic history. Our analysis reveals that galaxies at $z = 10.6$ reside in dark matter halos over an order of magnitude less massive ($M\_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{10.12} M\_{\odot}$) than their counterparts at $z = 5.5$ ($M\_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{11.45} M\_{\odot}$), while exhibiting correspondingly higher effective bias values ($b\_{\rm{g}}^{\rm{eff}} = 8.13^{+0.04}\_{-0.02}$ compared to $5.64^{+0.10}\_{-0.13}$). Correspondingly, the satellite galaxy fraction hints at a declining trend with decreasing redshift, reaching $<1\%$ by $z \sim 5-6$. However, the significant systematic and random uncertainties in the data-model comparison prevent us from drawing robust conclusions on the evolution - if any - of the satellite fraction during the epoch of reionization. These results provide the first view of the coevolution between galaxies and dark matter evolved at redshift $\gtrsim 10$, offering additional and independent constraints on early galaxy formation models tuned to reproducing luminosity function evolution.

2026-01-04, **Simulation of the CYGNO Gaseous TPC Optical Readout**, F. D. Amaro et.al., [2601.01435v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01435v1)

 Gaseous Time Projection Chambers with Optical Readout are sensitive detectors suitable for 3D measurement of low-energy O(1 keV) particles and are proposed for detecting rare events such as Dark Matter particle interactions. The CYGNO collaboration is developing such a detector with a high spatial and energy resolution, leveraging an innovative optical readout system. A reliable simulation of the detector response is needed to properly assess the physics reach of this technique and to better understand the performance of the detector in the development phase. Such a simulation cannot entirely rely on existing software packages; indeed, none of the available tools is capable of properly and reliably treating the different phenomena occurring in the detector, from the primary interaction in the gas volume throughout the whole detector response model, including charge transport, light production and propagation, and the response of the optical sensors. In this paper, we present a modeling of the detector response tuned on the CYGNO Optical TPC case; a description of the method is reported together with comparisons with experimental data from the LIME prototype to demonstrate the simulation performances.

2026-01-04, **A refined model of secondary photon emission from heavy WIMP annihilations in the Galactic Centre**, Rajat Shinde et.al., [2601.01397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01397v1)

 Heavy Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) remain a prominent yet less constrained dark matter (DM) candidate, with the Galactic Centre (GC) serving as a prime target for indirect detection via gamma-ray signals. Extending our previous work that highlighted the significance of secondary inverse Compton (IC) emission from annihilation-produced electrons, we expand the analysis to a broader range of WIMP masses and introduce a more realistic spatially-dependent modelling framework for the GC environment. This approach incorporates complexities such as the three-dimensional DM distribution, spatially varying radiation and magnetic fields, and electron transport mechanisms like Galactic winds and diffusion. We assess the impact of these environmental factors on both the spatial and spectral characteristics of the resulting secondary emissions. Our results demonstrate the robustness and necessity of incorporating this emission, and highlight its role in enhancing the prospects for detecting heavy WIMPs through observations of the inner Galaxy. We provide the resulting data products to the community to support future analyses and observational studies.

2026-01-04, **Effective dark matter component presents a robust signature of negative pressure by the DESI observations**, Hao Xu et.al., [2601.01340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01340v1)

 Comprehensive cosmological analysis of an effective non-standard dark matter(NSDM) model, characterized by an equation of state $w\_{\mathrm{dm}} = w\_2 a^2$, which allows for mild deviations from the previously assumed pressureless cold dark matter, is elaborated in the present work. This effective description framework is the scenarios that matter contents coupled to three distinct single-parameter dynamical dark energy models: i.e, the thawing scalar field, the Modified Emergent Dark Energy(MEDE) scenario, and the constant-$w$ model. We constrain these frameworks by using the latest cosmological probes, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), and three compilations of Type Ia Supernovae(SN Ia) namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus (PP) sample. Across all three dark energy scenarios and all dataset combinations, we find a consistent preference for negative values of the parameter $w\_2$. Furthermore, this result is robust against the choice of dark energy parametrization, suggesting a model-independent deviation from "standard" cold dark matter. This result indicates that the dark matter fluid possesses a small but non-vanishing negative pressure, meaning a non-cold nature. While the inferred Hubble constant $H\_0$ remains consistent with the Planck $Λ$CDM value and does not fully alleviate the $H\_0$ tension with local measurements, the persistent detection of $w\_2 < 0$ across a wide range of independent cosmological probes provides compelling evidence for new physics in the dark matter sector -- suggesting that dark matter may be better described as an effective fluid endowed with a mild negative pressure, rather than as a perfectly cold, pressureless substance.

2026-01-05, **A comprehensive search for high-velocity X-ray sources: New compact object binary candidates in the Gaia era**, Yue Zhao et.al., [2601.02287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02287v1)

 We perform a comprehensive search for high-velocity X-ray sources with large X-ray/optical flux ratios ($F\_\mathrm{X}/F\_\mathrm{G}$), identifying candidates for interacting black hole or neutron star binaries potentially accelerated by supernova natal kicks. We cross-match X-ray points sources from a variety of catalogues (Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift and eROSITA) with Gaia DR3. Using Gaia coordinates, parallaxes, and proper motions, we compute peculiar velocities ($\upsilon\_\mathrm{pec}$) relative to Galactic disc rotation. Remaining agnostic about radial velocities (RVs), we vary RVs to find the minimum possible $\upsilon\_\mathrm{pec}$ values ($\upsilon\_\mathrm{pec, min}$). Uncertainties on $\upsilon\_\mathrm{pec, min}$ are estimated via Monte Carlo resampling, and we select X-ray sources that have $1\,σ$ lower limits on $\upsilon\_\mathrm{pec, min}\geq 200\,\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and high $F\_\mathrm{X}/F\_\mathrm{G}$ values. We show that this velocity threshold excludes most contaminants (e.g., cataclysmic variables and active binaries) while retaining a sensible fraction of compact object binaries, demonstrating that $\upsilon\_\mathrm{pec}$ could serve as an effective indicator for the presence of a neutron star or black hole companion. Our selection yields a sample of 2372 sources, from which we construct a gold sample of 7 sources that have relatively well-constrained astrometry and confident optical counterparts. Follow-up is necessary to confirm and characterise their high-energy emission, as well as a Galactic disc vs. halo origin.

2026-01-05, **Quintom Dark Energy: Future Attractor and Phantom Crossing in Light of DESI DR2 Observation**, Phusuda Thanankullaphong et.al., [2601.02284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02284v1)

 We study the late-time cosmological dynamics of a two-field dark energy model consisting of a canonical quintessence scalar field and a phantom scalar field in a spatially flat FLRW universe. The fields are minimally coupled to gravity and uncoupled at the level of the potential, with the quintessence sector governed by an exponential potential and the phantom sector by an inverse power-law potential. By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability. A notable feature of the model is that the effective dark energy equation of state undergoes phantom divide crossing in a gradual and asymptotic manner, rather than as a sharp transition.

2026-01-05, **The JWST EXCELS survey: Outflows in 1.5 < z < 5 quiescent galaxies are likely relics from episodic AGN activity**, Elizabeth Taylor et.al., [2601.02269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02269v1)

 We investigate the presence and origin of neutral gas outflows and inflows in 13 post-starburst (PSB) and quiescent galaxies at redshifts 1.8 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 4.6, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the EXCELS survey. NaD absorption profiles reveal that 3 out of 13 exhibit blueshifted absorption indicative of outflows, and a further 2 objects show signs of inflowing gas. Outflow velocities range from $\approx$ 300 - 1200 kms$^{-1}$, and we find gas flows are detected exclusively in objects that quenched $\lt$ 600 Myr ago. This result holds when we include comparable objects from recent literature. We derive mass outflow rates over two orders of magnitude higher than current levels of star formation in our sample, indicating that the winds are unlikely to be driven by supernovae, and likely play a significant role in keeping the galaxies quenched. The majority of the outflow sample have anomalously high energy and momentum outflow rates compared to those predicted for current levels of star formation or AGN activity. We conclude that we are likely observing fossil outflows driven by previous, more luminous AGN activity which has since faded. We then compare with the EAGLE simulation to explore a potential 'outflow cycle', finding that our observations are consistent with a model in which z $\sim$ 3 quiescent galaxies undergo short $\simeq$ 5 Myr periods of AGN activity strong enough to drive outflows, which occur every $\simeq$ 40 Myr on average. This AGN activity drives observable outflows that persist for up to $\simeq$ 10 Myr after the AGN fades, followed by a $\simeq$ 20 Myr lull, and a subsequent short inflow, which eventually re-ignites AGN activity, and the cycle repeats.

2026-01-05, **A phoenix rises from the ashes: WOH G64 is still a red supergiant, for now**, Jacco Th. van Loon et.al., [2601.02057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02057v1)

 For a long time, WOH G64 was known as the most extreme red supergiant outside our Galaxy. However, in a matter of years it has faded, its pulsations have become suppressed and the spectrum has become dominated by emission lines from ionised gas, a far cry from the Mira-like pulsation and late M-type spectrum it used to display. Around the same time, a hot dust cloud was discovered using the VLT interferometer. WOH G64 has been claimed to have turned into a yellow hypergiant, which could signal a pre-supernova post-red supergiant evolution. Here we present spectra of WOH G64 obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) between November 2024 and December 2025. Molecular absorption bands from TiO are seen at all times. This implies that WOH G64 is currently a red supergiant, and may never have ceased to be. However, the shallow, resolved bands and possible detection of VO hint at a highly extended atmosphere. The continuum appears to be varying, while the line emission shows a different behaviour, suggesting two separate components in the system. Meanwhile, atomic absorption lines are deepening. This places important constraints on scenarios for the dramatic events that are unfolding.

2026-01-05, **The Betelgeuse Enigma: The Betelbuddy Hypothesis**, Priya Hasan et.al., [2601.02012v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02012v1)

 In the past six years, Betelgeuse has been in the news and drawn significant public interest. Starting in October 2019, Betelgeuse underwent a striking dimming event, fading from magnitude 0.5 to 1.7 by mid February 2020 a threefold decrease in brightness This gave rise to a number of speculative debates that the star was on the verge of a supernova, a moment of eerie quiet before the cosmic outburst. In a previous article, the author discussed the most accepted explanation to the dimming caused by episodic mass loss that released large dust grains, which obscured Betelgeuse's light and made it appear fainter. This interpretation suggested that the dimming was not a precursor to a supernova, as Betelgeuse is likely still far from reaching that stage.   On 21 July 2025, the existence of the companion star was confirmed with direct imaging, for the first time, by the alopeke instrument on the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope. The companion is 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse and orbits close to Betelgeuse itself, within the supergiant star's extended outer atmosphere. The stellar companion was detected at an angular separation of 52 mas and a position angle of 115 deg east of north. These measurements, along with its brightness, being roughly 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse at 466 nm, are in excellent agreement with dynamical predictions. Although this was only a 1.5 sigma detection, the agreement in the companion's appearance, separation, position angle, magnitude difference, and estimated mass is reasonable, making the result tentatively acceptable. The next optimum period for observations is November 2027, when we hope to get better observations. This article describes the interesting twists and turns of this study and what lies in the future for Betelgeuse and its companion, Betelbuddy or Siwarha.

2026-01-05, **Extended Ionized Fe Objects in the UWIFE Survey**, Kim Yesol et.al., [2601.01812v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01812v1)

 We explore systematically the shocked gas in the first Galactic quadrant of the Milky Way using the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Wide-field Infrared Survey for Fe+ (UWIFE). The UWIFE survey is the first imaging survey of the Milky Way in the [Fe II] 1.644 um emission line and covers the Galactic plane in the first Galactic quadrant (7 deg < l < 62 deg; \|b\| < 1.5 deg). We identify 204 extended ionized Fe objects (IFOs) using a combination of a manual and automatic search. Most of the IFOs are detected for the first time in the [Fe II] 1.644 um line. We present a catalog of the measured sizes and fluxes of the IFOs and searched for their counterparts by performing positional cross-matching with known sources. We found that IFOs are associated with supernova remnants (25), young stellar objects (100), H II regions (33), planetary nebulae (17), and luminous blue variables (4). The statistical and morphological properties are discussed for each of these.

2026-01-05, **Light curve modeling of the nearest neutron star candidate LAMOST J235456.73+335625.9**, Qing-bo Han et.al., [2601.01755v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01755v1)

 The discovery of heavy radioactive elements (e.g., $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$) on Earth suggests that supernova explosions may have occurred near our planet within the past million years, potentially having a significant impact on the ecological environment. This finding has motivated the search for nearby neutron stars in the Solar neighborhood. In a recent study, a candidate for one of the closest neutron stars to Earth, LAMOST J235456.73+335625.9 (hereafter J2354), was reported. Based on dynamical mass measurements under different inclination angle assumptions, the inferred mass range for the unseen compact companion in the system is $1.4$--$1.6$ $M\_{\odot}$. Hence, the unseen companion in J2354 is either a massive cold white dwarf or a neutron star. Here we model the flux variations of J2354 as a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and surface spots. We test both cold spot and hot spot models, setting the number of spots to two in each case, and constrain the spot properties through light curve fitting. In the cold spot scenario, the spots are mostly visible at phases $0.5$--$0.75$, whereas in the hot spot scenario, the spots appear predominantly at phases $0.25$--$0.5$. The hot spot model shows better agreement with the observed H$α$ phase variation than the cold spot model. Furthermore, the thermal radiation of a massive but cold white dwarf cannot produce the level of localized heating required to explain the hot spot unless additional heating mechanisms are involved; in contrast, a neutron star can naturally provide such heating through energetic winds. Our results are consistent with the neutron star interpretation of the compact object in J2354.

 The life-cycle, structure, and dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) is regulated by turbulence. Complex physical processes, including supernova (SN) explosions, shear, and gravitational collapse, drive and maintain turbulence, but it is still an open question what turbulence driving mode is primarily excited by these different mechanisms. The turbulence driving parameter, b, can be used to quantify the ratio of solenoidal to compressive modes in the acceleration field that drives the turbulence. Compressive driving is characterised by b ~ 1, while purely solenoidal driving gives b ~ 0.3. To quantify the turbulence in the galactic ISM, we investigate the time evolution of b, as well as the turbulent Mach number, and plasma beta (thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio), and its correlation with star formation in the magnetised warm neutral medium (WNM) of the TIGRESS shearing-box simulations of a kpc-sized patch of a Milky-Way-like galaxy, over a 100 Myr time period (~ half an orbital time). In this simulation the turbulence is driven by a combination of shear, gravitational collapse, and star formation feedback in the form of radiation and SNe. We find that the turbulence driving parameter fluctuates in time between b ~ 0.4 and b ~ 1. We find a time-dependent correlation of b with star formation activity, such that high star formation rates follow about one turbulent turnover time (~ 10 Myr) after phases of highly compressive driving (b > 0.5). About 20 Myr after the peak in star formation, type-B SN feedback drives up the WNM fraction and turbulent Mach numbers, and reduces plasma beta and the driving to b ~ 0.4-0.5.

2026-01-04, **Analysis of 14 Years of X-Ray Emission From SN 2011DH**, Elisa J. Gao et.al., [2601.01365v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01365v1)

 Ejecta from core-collapse supernovae interact with the circumstellar medium shed by the progenitor star, producing X-ray emission. Previous studies analyzed the X-ray spectrum of the Type IIb supernova SN 2011dh up to 500 days after explosion. Long-term monitoring of X-ray emission provides valuable constraints on supernova evolution and progenitor systems, yet such studies remain rare for Type IIb events due to limited data. Here we present the most comprehensive X-ray light curve of SN 2011dh to date, combining all available Chandra and XMM-Newton data with previously published and newly released Swift observations, extending coverage to 5100 days. We measure a luminosity decline proportional to t$^{-0.74 \pm 0.04}$ and infer a mass-loss rate of $(1.0-2.2) \times 10^{-6}$ solar masses per year for $v\_w = 10$ km/s, or $(2.0-4.4) \times 10^{-6} $ solar masses per year for $v\_w = 20$ km/s. These estimates agree with earlier results, supporting the interpretation that the X-ray emission has been dominated by an adiabatic reverse shock. The consistency of our late-time results with previous studies demonstrates that SN 2011dh has evolved steadily for nearly 14 years.

2026-01-04, **Effective dark matter component presents a robust signature of negative pressure by the DESI observations**, Hao Xu et.al., [2601.01340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01340v1)

 Comprehensive cosmological analysis of an effective non-standard dark matter(NSDM) model, characterized by an equation of state $w\_{\mathrm{dm}} = w\_2 a^2$, which allows for mild deviations from the previously assumed pressureless cold dark matter, is elaborated in the present work. This effective description framework is the scenarios that matter contents coupled to three distinct single-parameter dynamical dark energy models: i.e, the thawing scalar field, the Modified Emergent Dark Energy(MEDE) scenario, and the constant-$w$ model. We constrain these frameworks by using the latest cosmological probes, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), and three compilations of Type Ia Supernovae(SN Ia) namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus (PP) sample. Across all three dark energy scenarios and all dataset combinations, we find a consistent preference for negative values of the parameter $w\_2$. Furthermore, this result is robust against the choice of dark energy parametrization, suggesting a model-independent deviation from "standard" cold dark matter. This result indicates that the dark matter fluid possesses a small but non-vanishing negative pressure, meaning a non-cold nature. While the inferred Hubble constant $H\_0$ remains consistent with the Planck $Λ$CDM value and does not fully alleviate the $H\_0$ tension with local measurements, the persistent detection of $w\_2 < 0$ across a wide range of independent cosmological probes provides compelling evidence for new physics in the dark matter sector -- suggesting that dark matter may be better described as an effective fluid endowed with a mild negative pressure, rather than as a perfectly cold, pressureless substance.

2026-01-04, **SN 2024abvb: A Type Icn Supernova in the Outskirts of its Host Galaxy**, Maokai Hu et.al., [2601.01333v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01333v1)

 We present multiband photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2024abvb, which exhibits early-time prominent photoionized narrow emission lines of C II superposed on a blue continuum. The absence of Balmer features indicates that the SN exploded within hydrogen-poor circumstellar matter (CSM). Together with the lack of explicit evidence of helium signatures, we tentatively identify SN 2024abvb as a Type Icn SN (SN Icn). After correcting for extinction, we estimate an r-band peak absolute magnitude of -19.7, placing SN 2024abvb in the luminous regime of SNe Icn. We adopted a hybrid model that accounts for both the energy released by the ejecta-CSM interaction and the radioactive decay of nickel synthesized in the SN ejecta to fit the light curve of SN 2024abvb. The best-fit model to the multiband light curves within the first ~ 40 days after explosion suggests that the CSM, radioactive nickel, and ejecta masses to be 0.28 Msun, 3.54 * 10-3 Msun, and 0.12 Msun, respectively. Such a low ejecta mass indicates that the progenitor star of SN 2024abvb experienced a significant mass-stripping process, consistent with the hydrogen-poor and helium-poor spectral features. SN 2024abvb provides important insights into the physical origins of the rare subclass of SNe Icn.
