2025-01-07, **Effective textures from a $[SU(3)]^3$ flavored scalar sector**, A. Carrillo-Monteverde et.al., [2501.03872v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03872v1)

 Current constraints on flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) strongly indicate that any new physics emerging at the 1-10 TeV scale must adhere to the Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV) principle, where Yukawa couplings are the sole sources of flavor violation. In this work, we present a model inspired by a gauged $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry that dynamically generates leptonic Yukawa matrices through effective operators. The model incorporates a scalar sector with two sets of flavons, characterized by their vacuum expectation values (VEVs), which govern the suppression scale of the Yukawa couplings and the hierarchy of neutrino masses. By leveraging phenomenologically viable Yukawa textures, we derive restrictions on the flavon VEVs and demonstrate the compatibility of the model with experimental neutrino oscillation data. Furthermore, the model predicts at least one neutrino mass to be strongly suppressed, consistent with the normal mass ordering and experimental upper bounds. This framework provides a robust mechanism for dynamically generating neutrino masses and mixing while addressing key challenges in leptonic flavor physics, such as FCNC suppression and CP-violating phases.

2025-01-07, **GraphNeT 2.0 -- A Deep Learning Library for Neutrino Telescopes**, Rasmus F. Ørsøe et.al., [2501.03817v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03817v1)

 Neutrino telescopes, an extension of traditional multiwavelength astronomy, provide a complementary view of the universe using neutrinos. Differences in detector geometry and detection medium mean that improvements to reconstruction techniques made at one experiment are not readily applicable to another. Recently, deep learning has been shown to improve prediction speed and accuracy and offer indifference to detector geometry and detection medium, providing a unique opportunity for collaboration. This work introduces GraphNeT 2.0, an open-source, detector-agnostic deep learning library for neutrino telescopes and related experiments. GraphNeT enables inter-experimental collaboration on the use and development of advanced methods based on major deep learning paradigms like transformers, normalizing flows, graph neural networks, and more.

2025-01-07, **Constraints on the properties of macroscopic transport in the Sun from combined lithium and beryllium depletion**, G. Buldgen et.al., [2501.03723v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03723v1)

 Context. The Sun is a privileged laboratory of stellar evolution, thanks to the quality and complementary nature of available constraints. Using these observations, we are able to draw a detailed picture of its internal structure and dynamics which form the basis of the successes of solar modelling. Amongst such constraints, the depletion of lithium and beryllium are key tracers of the required efficiency and extent of macroscopic mixing just below the solar convective envelope. Thanks to revised determinations of these abundances, we may use them in conjunction with other existing spectroscopic and helioseismic constraints to study in detail the properties of macroscopic transport. Aims. We aim at constraining the efficiency of macroscopic transport at the base of the convective envelope and determining the compatibility of the observations with a suggested candidate linked with the transport of angular momentum in the solar radiative interior. Methods. We use recent spectroscopic observations of lithium and beryllium abundance and include them in solar evolutionary model calibrations. We test the agreement of such models in terms of position of the convective envelope, helium mass fraction in convective zone, sound speed profile inversions and neutrino fluxes. Results. We constrain the required efficiency and extent of the macroscopic mixing at the base of the solar convective envelope, finding that a power law of density with an index n between 3 and 6 would reproduce the data, with efficiencies at the base of the envelope of about 6000 cm2 /s, depending on the value of n. We also confirm that macroscopic mixing worsens the agreement with neutrino fluxes and that the current implementations of the magnetic Tayler instability are unable to explain the observations.

2025-01-07, **The Gallium Solar Neutrino Capture Cross Section Revisited**, W. C. Haxton et.al., [2501.03528v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03528v1)

 Solar neutrino flux constraints from the legacy GALLEX/GNO and SAGE experiments continue to influence contemporary global analyses of neutrino properties. The constraints depend on the neutrino absorption cross sections for various solar sources. Following recent work updating the $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar neutrino source cross sections, we reevaluate the $^{71}$Ga solar neutrino cross sections, focusing on contributions from transitions to $^{71}$Ge excited states, but also revising the ground-state transition to take into account new $^{71}$Ge electron-capture lifetime measurements and various theory corrections. The excited-state contributions have been traditionally taken from forward-angle $(p,n)$ cross sections. Here we correct this procedure for the $\approx 10\%-20\%$ tensor operator contribution that alters the relationship between Gamow-Teller and $(p,n)$ transition strengths. Using state-of-the-art nuclear shell-model calculations to evaluate this correction, we find that it lowers the $^8$B and hep neutrino cross sections. However, the addition of other corrections, including contributions from near-threshold continuum states that radiatively decay, leads to an overall increase in the $^8$B and hep cross sections of $\approx 10\%$ relative to the values recommended by Bahcall. Uncertainties are propagated using Monte Carlo simulations.

2025-01-07, **Implications of the intriguing constant inner mass surface density observed in dark matter halos**, Jorge Sanchez Almeida et.al., [2501.03761v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03761v1)

 It is known for long that the observed mass surface density of cored dark matter (DM) halos is approximately constant, independently of the galaxy mass (i.e., rhoc X rc simeq constant}, with rhoc and rc the central volume density and the radius of the core, respectively). Here we review the evidence supporting this empirical fact as well as its theoretical interpretation. It seems to be an emergent law resulting from the concentration-halo mass relation predicted by the current cosmological model, where the DM is made of collisionless cold DM particles (CDM). We argue that the prediction rhoc X rc simeq constant is not specific to this particular model of DM but holds for any other DM model (e.g., self-interacting) or process (e.g., stellar or AGN feedback) that redistributes the DM within halos conserving its CDM mass. In addition, the fact that rhoc X rc simeq constant is shown to allow the estimate of the core DM mass and baryon fraction from stellar photometry alone, particularly useful when the observationally-expensive conventional spectroscopic techniques are unfeasible.

2025-01-07, **Halo spin and orientation in Interacting Dark Matter Dark Energy Cosmology**, Guandi Zhao et.al., [2501.03750v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03750v1)

 In recent years, the interaction between dark matter (DM) and dark energy has become a topic of interest in cosmology. Interacting dark matter-dark energy (IDE) models have a substantial impact on the formation of cosmological large-scale structures, which serve as the background for DM halo evolution. This impact can be examined through the shape and spin orientation of halos in numerical simulations incorporating IDE effects. In our work, we use the N-body simulation pipeline ME-GADGET to simulate and study the halo spin and orientation in IDE models. We found that in models where DM transfers into DE (IDE I), the alignment of halo shapes with the surrounding tidal field is enhanced, while the alignment of halo spins with the tidal field is decreased compared to {\Lambda}CDM. Conversely, in models where DE transfers into DM (IDE II), the opposite occurs. We have provided fitted functions to describe these alignment signals. Our study provides the foundation for more accurate modeling of observations in the future such as China Space Station Telescope.

2025-01-07, **A cosmic degeneracy story: structure formation with warm dark matter and scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities**, Clément Stahl et.al., [2501.03672v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03672v1)

 It has been recently shown that cosmological models with scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities (sPNG) could provide a possible path to solve current cosmic tensions. Moreover, it has been pointed out that some of these models might mimic the effects of Warm Dark Matter (WDM) for several observables at low redshift. Here, we confirm the qualitative similarity of the matter power spectrum for sPNG and WDM models, but also point out differences in the halo mass function and void size function. We then jointly simulate WDM and sPNG together. Such simulations allow us to demonstrate that the joint impact of WDM and sPNG is close to the linear superposition of their respective effects at low redshift, at the percent level. We finally propose a model with mixed hot and cold dark matter together with sPNG, that reproduces the $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum at redshifts $z \leq 3$ but is still distinct in terms of halo statistics.

2025-01-07, **Dark matter from inflationary quantum fluctuations**, Mohammad Ali Gorji et.al., [2501.03444v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03444v1)

 We explore a scenario in which dark matter is a massive bosonic field, arising solely from quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. In this framework, dark matter exhibits primordial isocurvature perturbations with an amplitude of ${\cal O}(1)$ at small scales that are beyond the reach of current observations such as those from the CMB and large-scale structure. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. Based on this result, we also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exact transfer function reproduces known behaviors. Assuming a monochromatic initial power spectrum, we use the transfer function to identify the viable parameter space defined by the dark matter mass and the length scale of perturbations. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of a large population of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations.

2025-01-07, **Cosmic-ray acceleration and escape from supernova remnant W44 as probed by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC**, S. Abe et.al., [2501.03889v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03889v1)

 Context. The supernova remnant (SNR) W44 and its surroundings are a prime target for studying the acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs). Several previous studies established an extended gamma-ray emission that is set apart from the radio shell of W44. This emission is thought to originate from escaped high-energy CRs that interact with a surrounding dense molecular cloud complex. Aims. We present a detailed analysis of Fermi-LAT data with an emphasis on the spatial and spectral properties of W44 and its surroundings. We also report the results of the observations performed with the MAGIC telescopes of the northwestern region of W44. Finally, we present an interpretation model to explain the gamma-ray emission of the SNR and its surroundings. Methods. We first performed a detailed spatial analysis of 12 years of Fermi-LAT data at energies above 1 GeV, in order to exploit the better angular resolution, while we set a threshold of 100MeV for the spectral analysis. We performed a likelihood analysis of 174 hours of MAGIC data above 130 GeV using the spatial information obtained with Fermi-LAT. Results. The combined spectra of Fermi-LAT and MAGIC, extending from 100MeV to several TeV, were used to derive constraints on the escape of CRs. Using a time-dependent model to describe the particle acceleration and escape from the SNR, we show that the maximum energy of the accelerated particles has to be ' 40 GeV. However, our gamma-ray data suggest that a small number of lower-energy particles also needs to escape. We propose a novel model, the broken-shock scenario, to account for this effect and explain the gamma-ray emission.

2025-01-07, **Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?**, Chan-Gyung Park et.al., [2501.03480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480v1)

 We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ expressed using three different quadratic and other polynomial forms (as functions of $1-a$, where $a$ is the scale factor), without and with a varying cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing consistency parameter $A\_L$. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z)$), and growth factor ($f\sigma\_8$) measurements, but not recent DESI BAO data. The six $w(z)$CDM ($+A\_L$) parametrizations show higher consistency between the CMB and non-CMB data constraints compared to the XCDM ($+A\_L$) and $w\_0 w\_a$CDM ($+A\_L$) cases. Constraints from the most-restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation on the six $w(z)$CDM ($+A\_L$) parametrizations indicate that dark energy dynamics is favored over a cosmological constant by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ when $A\_L = 1$, but only by $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ when $A\_L$ is allowed to vary (and $A\_L>1$ at $\sim2\sigma$ significance). Non-CMB data dominate the P18+lensing+non-CMB compilation at low $z$ and favor quintessence-like dark energy. At high $z$ P18+lensing data dominate, favoring phantom-like dark energy with significance from $1.5\sigma$ to $2.9 \sigma$ when $A\_L = 1$, and from $1.1\sigma$ to $1.8\sigma$ when $A\_L$ varies. These results suggest that the observed excess weak lensing smoothing of some of the Planck CMB anistropy multipoles is partially responsible for the $A\_L = 1$ cases $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence for dark energy dynamics over a cosmological constant.
