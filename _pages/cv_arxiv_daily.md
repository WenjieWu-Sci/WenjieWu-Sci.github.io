2023-10-18, **Time-energy uncertainty relation for neutrino oscillations: historical development, applications and future prospects**, Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano et.al., [2310.12124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12124v1)

 Time-energy uncertainty relation (TEUR) plays a fundamental role in quantum mechanics, as it allows to grasp peculiar aspects of a variety of phenomena based on very general principles and symmetries of the theory. Using the Mandelstam-Tamm method, TEUR has been recently derived for neutrino oscillations by connecting the uncertainty on neutrino energy with the characteristic time-scale of oscillations. Interestingly enough, the suggestive interpretation of neutrinos as unstable-like particles has proved to naturally emerge in this context. Further aspects have been later discussed in semiclassical gravity by computing corrections to the neutrino energy uncertainty in a generic stationary curved spacetime, and in quantum field theory, where the clock observable turns out to be identified with the non-conserved flavor charge operator. In the present work, we give an overview on the above achievements. In particular, we analyze the implications of TEUR and explore the impact of gravitational and non-relativistic effects on the standard condition for neutrino oscillations. Correlations with the quantum-information theoretic analysis of oscillations and possible experimental consequences are qualitatively discussed.

2023-10-18, **Scotogenic $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ origin of $(g-2)_μ$, W-mass anomaly and 95 GeV excess**, Debasish Borah et.al., [2310.11953v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11953v1)

 We study a scotogenic extension of the minimal gauged $L\_{\mu}-L\_{\tau}$ model, including three right-handed singlet fermions and a scalar doublet all odd under an in-built $Z\_2$ symmetry to explain the anomalous magnetic moments of the muon, CDF-II W-mass anomaly, and the 95 GeV excess reported by the CMS collaboration. While the minimal model can successfully explain the muon $(g-2)$ and CDF-II W-mass anomalies, the required diphoton signal strength for the 95 GeV scalar, together with that of the SM Higgs, can not be obtained in the minimal model. The same can, however, be explained by incorporating two additional scalar doublets whose only role is to contribute radiatively to diphoton decay modes of the light, neutral scalars. Due to the scotogenic extension, the model remains consistent with the observed properties of light neutrinos and dark matter in the Universe.

2023-10-18, **Results and Prospects of T2K**, T. Nosek et.al., [2310.11942v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11942v1)

 T2K is a neutrino oscillation experiment with a 295 km long baseline between the far detector, Super-Kamiokande, and a suite of near detectors to study $\nu\_\mu/\bar{\nu}\_\mu$ disappearance and $\nu\_e/\bar{\nu}\_e$ appearance in a $\nu\_\mu/\bar{\nu}\_\mu$ neutrino beam produced at J-PARC. The experiment has excluded CP conservation in the three-neutrino oscillation model at $>90~\%$ CL and precisely constrained the parameters $\vert \Delta m\_{32}^2 \vert$ and $\sin^2 \theta\_{23}$. This paper reports on the novelties of the most up-to-date 2022 analysis and the near-future prospects of T2K.

2023-10-18, **Novel techniques for alpha/beta pulse shape discrimination in Borexino**, D. Basilico et.al., [2310.11826v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11826v1)

 Borexino could efficiently distinguish between alpha and beta radiation in its liquid scintillator by the characteristic time profile of their scintillation pulse. This alpha/beta discrimination, first demonstrated at the tonne scale in the Counting Test Facility prototype, was used throughout the lifetime of the experiment between 2007 and 2021. With this method, alpha events are identified and subtracted from the beta-like solar neutrino events. This is particularly important in liquid scintillator as alpha scintillation is quenched many-fold. In Borexino, the prominent Po-210 decay peak was a background in the energy range of electrons scattered from Be-7 solar neutrinos. Optimal alpha-beta discrimination was achieved with a "multi-layer perceptron neural network", which its higher ability to leverage the timing information of the scintillation photons detected by the photomultiplier tubes. An event-by-event, high efficiency, stable, and uniform pulse shape discrimination was essential in characterising the spatial distribution of background in the detector. This benefited most Borexino measurements, including solar neutrinos in the \pp chain and the first direct observation of the CNO cycle in the Sun. This paper presents the key milestones in alpha/beta discrimination in Borexino as a term of comparison for current and future large liquid scintillator detectors

2023-10-18, **Evidence of Hadronic Emission from the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A**, Kai Wang et.al., [2310.11821v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11821v1)

 Acceleration of hadrons in relativistic shocks has been long expected and invoked to model GRB high-energy photon and neutrino emissions. However, so far there has been no direct observational evidence of hadronic emission from GRBs. The B.O.A.T. ("brightest of all time") gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A had extreme energies (with an isotropic energy exceeding $10^{55}$ erg) and was detected in broad-band including the very-high-energy (VHE, $>100\,\rm GeV$) band up to $>10$ TeV. Here we perform a comprehensive spectral analysis of the GRB from keV to TeV energy range and perform detailed spectral and light curve modelings considering both the traditional synchrotron self-Compton process and the electromagnetic (EM) cascade process initiated by hadronic interactions by accelerated cosmic rays in the external shock. We find that the leptonic scenario alone is not adequate to account for the observations, whereas the proposed scenario with the combination of hadronic and leptonic components can well reproduce the multi-wavelength spectra and the light curve. This result reveals the existence of the accelerated hadronic component in the early afterglow of this extreme burst. According to this scenario, the observed TeV light curve should contain imprints of the prompt MeV emission.

2023-10-18, **Determine the Origin of Very-high-energy Gamma Rays from Galactic Sources by the Prospect of Observing Neutrinos**, Bo-Heng Song et.al., [2310.11813v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11813v1)

 Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) identified 12 $\gamma$-ray sources emitting above 100 TeV gamma rays, making them potential PeV cosmic-ray accelerators (PeVatrons). Neutrino observations are crucial in determining whether the gamma-ray radiation process is due to hadronic or leptonic origin. In this paper, we study three detected sources, LHAASO J1908+0621, LHAASO J2018+3651, and LHAASO J2032+4102, which are also the most promising galactic high-energy neutrino candidate sources with the lowest pre-trial p-value based on the stacking searches testing for excess neutrino emission by IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We study the lepto-hadronic scenario for the observed multiband spectra of these LHAASO sources considering the possible counterpart source of the LHAASO sources. The very-high-energy gamma rays are entirely attributed to the hadronic contribution, therefore the most optimistic neutrino flux can be derived. Then, we evaluate the statistical significance (p-value) as the observational time of the IceCube and next-generation IceCube-Gen2 neutrino observatory respectively. We find that the origin of gamma rays totally from the hadronic process or at most partially from the hadronic process can be determined by IceCube-Gen2 for LHAASO J1908+0621 at a $5\sigma$ significance level with a running time of $\sim 10$ months. For LHAASO J2018+3651 and LHAASO J2032+4102, the required running time is $\sim 10$ years ($3\sigma$) and $\sim 4$ years ($5\sigma$), respectively. The future confirmation by the next-generation neutrino telescope will be crucial to understanding the particle acceleration and the radiation processes inside the sources.

2023-10-17, **Determination of the Equation of State from Nuclear Experiments and Neutron Star Observations**, Chun Yuen Tsang et.al., [2310.11588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11588v1)

 With recent advances in neutron star observations, major progress has been made in determining the pressure of neutron star matter at high density. This pressure is constrained by the neutron star deformability, determined from gravitational waves emitted in a neutron-star merger, and measurements of radii for two neutron stars, using a new X-ray observatory on the International Space Station. Previous studies have relied on nuclear theory calculations to provide the equation of state at low density. Here we use a combination of 15 constraints composed of three astronomical observations and twelve nuclear experimental constraints that extend over a wide range of densities. Bayesian Inference is then used to obtain a comprehensive nuclear equation of state. This datacentric result provides benchmarks for theoretical calculations and modeling of nuclear matter and neutron stars. Furthermore, it provides insights on the composition of neutron stars and their cooling via neutrino radiation.

2023-10-17, **Search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the $2b + 2\ell + E_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{miss}$ final state in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\mathrm{TeV}$ with the ATLAS detector**, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., [2310.11286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11286v1)

 A search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair ($HH$) production is presented, in which one of the Higgs bosons decays to a b-quark pair ($b\bar b$) and the other decays to $WW^*$, $ZZ^*$, or $\tau^+\tau^-$, with in each case a final state with $\ell^+\ell^- +$ neutrinos ($\ell = e, \mu$). The analysis targets separately the gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes. Data recorded by the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $140\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, are used in this analysis. Events are selected to have exactly two $b$-tagged jets and two leptons with opposite electric charge and missing transverse momentum in the final state. These events are classified using multivariate analysis algorithms to separate the $HH$ events from other Standard Model processes. No evidence of the signal is found. The observed (expected) upper limit on the cross-section for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production is determined to be 9.7 (16.2) times the Standard Model prediction at 95% confidence level. The Higgs boson self-interaction coupling parameter $\kappa\_\lambda$ and the quadrilinear coupling parameter $\kappa\_{2V}$ are each separately constrained by this analysis to be within the ranges ${[-6.2, 13.3]}$ and ${[-0.17, 2.4]}$, respectively, at 95% confidence level, when all other parameters are fixed.

2023-10-17, **Revisiting Renormalization Group Equations of the SMEFT Dimension-Seven Operators**, Di Zhang et.al., [2310.11055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11055v1)

 In this work, we revisit the renormalization group equations (RGEs) of dimension-seven (dim-7) operators in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) resulting from mixing among dim-7 operators themselves by means of the background field method. Adopting a recently proposed physical basis for dim-7 operators, we achieve the explicit RGEs of all non-redundant dim-7 operators in the SMEFT for the first time. Together with those originating from the dim-5 and dim-6 operators, these results constitute the complete RGEs of dim-7 operators, and hence can be exploited to study full RG-running effects on some lepton- or baryon-number-violating processes involving dim-7 operators in the SMEFT, such as neutrino masses, neutrinoless double beta decay, meson and nucleon decays. We perform an analysis of the structure and perturbative power counting of the obtained one-loop anomalous dimension matrix, which is consistent with a non-renormalization theorem and the naive dimension analysis. Additionally, a partial check on some results is carried out by means of different tools and quantum field gauges.

2023-10-18, **Dissipationless collapse and the dynamical mass-ellipticity relation of elliptical galaxies in Newtonian gravity and MOND**, Pierfrancesco Di Cintio et.al., [2310.12114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12114v1)

 Context. Deur (2014) and Winters et al. (2023) proposed an empirical relation between the dark to total mass ratio and ellipticity in elliptical galaxies from their observed total dynamical mass-to-light ratio data M/L = (14.1 +/- 5.4){\epsilon}. In other words, the larger is the content of dark matter in the galaxy, the more the stellar component would be flattened. Such observational claim, if true, appears to be in stark contrast with the common intuition of the formation of galaxies inside dark halos with reasonably spherical symmetry. Aims. Comparing the processes of dissipationless galaxy formation in different theories of gravity, and emergence of the galaxy scaling relations therein is an important frame where, in principle one could discriminate them. Methods. By means of collisionless N-body simulations in modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity with and without active dark matter halos, with both spherical and clumpy initial structure, I study the trends of intrinsic and projected ellipticities, S\'ersic index and anisotropy with the total dynamical to stellar mass ratio. Results. It is shown that, the end products of both cold spherical collapses and mergers of smaller clumps depart more and more from the spherical symmetry for increasing values of the total dynamical mass to stellar mass, at least in a range of halo masses. The equivalent Newtonian systems of the end products of MOND collapses show a similar behaviour. The M/L relation obtained from the numerical experiments in both gravities is however rather different from that reported by Deur and coauthors.

2023-10-18, **Exploring the Potential of Residual Impurities in Germanium Detectors for Low-Mass Dark Matter Detection**, Dongming Mei et.al., [2310.11955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11955v1)

 The pursuit of low-mass dark matter detection hinges on achieving an unprecedentedly low energy detection threshold. Germanium (Ge) detectors, when meticulously tailored with precise impurity compositions, hold the promise of expanding their sensitivity to energy levels below the sub-electronvolt (sub-eV) range. In this study, we embark on an exploration of residual impurities inherent to Ge detectors, focusing on their behavior at helium temperatures. These impurity atoms undergo a captivating freeze-out phenomenon, transitioning into localized states known as excited dipole states. Through compelling evidence derived from the measurement of relative capacitance, we elucidate the transition of impurity atoms from free charge states to these localized dipole states, as the temperature plummets from 11 K to 6.5 K. Our investigation encompasses the intricate formation of these dipole states in both n-type and p-type impurities. Furthermore, we shed light on the electric field generated by these dipole states, unveiling their capacity to ensnare charges and foster the creation of cluster dipole states. Drawing from prior measurements, we affirm that these excited dipole states exhibit a binding energy of less than 10 meV, thus forging a path toward an exceptionally low detection threshold for low-mass dark matter. Capitalizing on this concept, we propose the development of a 1-kg Ge detector equipped with internal charge amplification, an innovative approach poised to surpass electrical noise and, in turn, empower the detection of low-mass dark matter with unprecedented sensitivity.

2023-10-17, **Modeling Post-Reionization HI Distributions in Fuzzy Dark Matter Cosmologies Using Conditional Normalizing Flows**, Tibor Dome et.al., [2310.11502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11502v1)

 Upcoming 21 cm intensity mapping experiments like the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) hold significant potential to constrain the properties of dark matter. In this work, we model neutral hydrogen (HI) distributions using high-resolution hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of both cold dark matter (CDM) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies in the post-reionization redshift range of $z=3.42-4.94$. We show that the HI abundance and the HI column density distribution function decrease in FDM-like cosmologies. Extreme FDM models with $m\sim 10^{-22}$ eV are at odds with a range of measurements. Due to the increased halo bias, the HI bias increases, paralleled by the damped \Lya \ (DLA) bias which we infer from the cross-section of DLAs. The DLA cross-section distribution in extreme FDM models has a high median at the low-mass end, which can be traced to the high column density of cosmic filaments. We study the prospects of detecting the brightest HI peaks with SKA1-Low at $z=4.94$, indicating moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) at angular resolution $\theta\_A = 2^{\prime}$ with a rapidly declining SNR for lower values of $\theta\_{A}$. After training the conditional normalizing flow network HIGlow on 2D HI maps, we interpolate its latent space of axion masses to predict the peak flux for a new, synthetic FDM cosmology, finding good agreement with expectations. This work thus underscores the potential of normalizing flows in capturing complex, non-linear structures within HI maps, offering a versatile tool for conditional sample generation and prediction tasks.

2023-10-17, **A Full Accounting of the Visible Mass in SDSS MaNGA Disk Galaxies**, Nitya Ravi et.al., [2310.11422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11422v1)

 We present a study of the ratio of visible mass to total mass in spiral galaxies to better understand the relative amount of dark matter present in galaxies of different masses and evolutionary stages. Using the velocities of the H-alpha emission line measured in spectroscopic observations from the SDSS MaNGA DR17, we evaluate the rotational velocity of 5522 disk galaxies at their 90% elliptical Petrosian radii, R90. We compare this to the velocity expected from the total visible mass, which we compute from the stellar, HI, molecular hydrogen, heavy metal, and dust masses. Molecular hydrogen mass measurements are available for only a small subset of galaxies observed in SDSS MaNGA DR17, so we derive a parameterization of the molecular hydrogen mass as a function of absolute magnitude in the r-band using galaxies observed as part of SDSS DR7. With these parameterizations, we calculate the fraction of visible mass within R90 that corresponds to the observed velocity. Based on statistically analyzing the likelihood of this fraction, we conclude that the null hypothesis (no dark matter) cannot be excluded at a confidence level better than 95% within the visible extent of the disk galaxies. We also find that, by including all of these mass components, star-forming disk galaxies contain statistically the same ratio of visible-to-total mass, independent of magnitude.

2023-10-17, **Exploring Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration with EoS Parameterizations in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity via Baryon Acoustic Oscillations**, Madhur Khurana et.al., [2310.11413v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11413v1)

 In our study, we have adopted the framework of Horava-Lifshitz gravity to model the Universe's dark matter and dark energy components. Specifically, we have considered two recent parametrizations for dark energy models: the CBDRM-type and CADMM-type parameterizations. In our analysis, we have explicitly expressed the Hubble parameter, denoted as $H(z)$, for these two distinct dark energy models. By doing so, we have aimed to investigate and quantify the accelerated cosmic expansion rate characterizing the late-time Universe. Our study uses a wide range of datasets. This dataset consists of recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) collected over a period of twenty years with the Cosmic Chronometers (CC) dataset, Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) dataset, the Hubble diagram of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), quasars (Q), and the latest measurement of the Hubble constant (R22). Consequently, we present a crucial aspect of our study by plotting the $r\_{d}$ vs. $H\_{0}$ plane. In the context of the $\Lambda$CDM model, after incorporating all the datasets, including the R22 prior, we obtain the following results: $H\_{0}$ = $71.674089 \pm 0.734089$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r\_d = 143.050380 Mpc \pm 3.702038$. For the CBDRM model, we find $H\_{0}$ = $72.355058 \pm 1.004604$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r\_d = 144.835069 Mpc \pm 2.378848$. In the case of the CADMM model, our analysis yields $H\_{0}$ = $72.347804 \pm 0.923328$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r\_d = 144.466836 Mpc \pm 4.288758$. We have conducted cosmographic analyses for both of the proposed parameterizations in comparison to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Additionally, we have applied Diagnostic tests to investigate the evolution of both models. Finally, the Information Criteria test demonstrates that the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges as the preferred choice among the models we have considered.

2023-10-17, **Dark matter scattering off ${}^4$He in chiral effective field theory**, J. de Vries et.al., [2310.11343v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11343v1)

 We study dark matter scattering off ${}^4$He and other light nuclei using chiral effective field theory. We consider scalar DM interactions and include both one- and two-nucleon scattering processes. The DM interactions and nuclear wave functions are obtained from chiral effective field theory and we work up to fourth order in the chiral expansion for the latter to investigate the chiral convergence. The results for the scattering rates can be used to determine the sensitivity of planned experiments to detect relatively light dark matter particles using ${}^4$He. We find that next-to-leading-order scalar currents are smaller than expected from power counting for scattering off ${}^4$He confirming earlier work. However, the results for two-nucleon corrections exhibit a linear regulator dependence indicating potential problems in the applied power counting. We observe a linear correlation between the, in principle not observable, D-wave probability of various light nuclei and the scalar two-nucleon matrix elements, again pointing towards potentially missing contributions.

2023-10-17, **Status and first results from XENONnT**, S. E. M. Ahmed Maouloud et.al., [2310.11322v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11322v1)

 XENON is a project for direct dark matter search located in the INFN underground laboratory LNGS. The previous generation of XENON detector, XENON1T, achieved an exposure of 1 ton$\times$year, setting the most stringent limits on the spin-independent scattering cross section of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) on nucleons for nearly the complete range of WIMP masses above $120$ MeV. The multi-tonne XENONnT detector is the next step in the evolution of the XENON project. The experiment, aimed at directly detecting WIMPs, utilizes $5.9~t$ of instrumented liquid Xenon (LXe). The expected overall background in the detector is based on dedicated screening results of all detector materials. In contrast, improvements in mitigating intrinsic backgrounds from electronic recoil sources allow XENONnT to reduce this background compared to its predecessor. Adding a neutron veto around the XENONnT cryostat also allows for a significant rejection of the neutron background. XENONnT aims at achieving a 20 ton$\times$year exposure over its lifetime. The talk summarised the main results of XENON1T and the status of XENONnT.

2023-10-17, **QUEST-DMC superfluid $^3$He detector for sub-GeV dark matter**, S. Autti et.al., [2310.11304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11304v1)

 The focus of dark matter searches to date has been on Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in the GeV/$c^2$-TeV/$c^2$ mass range. The direct, indirect and collider searches in this mass range have been extensive but ultimately unsuccessful, providing a strong motivation for widening the search outside this range. Here we describe a new concept for a dark matter experiment, employing superfluid $^3$He as a detector for dark matter that is close to the mass of the proton, of order 1 GeV/$c^2$. The QUEST-DMC detector concept is based on quasiparticle detection in a bolometer cell by a nanomechanical resonator. In this paper we develop the energy measurement methodology and detector response model, simulate candidate dark matter signals and expected background interactions, and calculate the sensitivity of such a detector. We project that such a detector can reach sub-eV nuclear recoil energy threshold, opening up new windows on the parameter space of both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions of light dark matter candidates.

2023-10-17, **Sommerfeld effect for continuum gamma-ray spectra from Dark Matter annihilation**, Barbara Jäger et.al., [2310.11067v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11067v1)

 We present a calculation of the continuum part of the gamma-ray spectra resulting from Dark Matter annihilation in the framework of the MSSM taking into account Sommerfeld effects. Concentrating on pure wino and pure higgsino scenarios we compare our calculation to existing work and explore the numerical impact of the features not captured by previous approximative descriptions. We find that, in particular for large neutralino masses, when the Sommerfeld enhancement is very large, chargino-antichargino annihilation processes, which have not been considered before, lead to sizable differences with respect to existing calculations. In scenarios with neutralinos in the intermediate-mass range, we find that the role of the charginos is crucial in the endpoint regime. Our calculation provides the currently most accurate prediction for the continuum gamma-ray spectra.

2023-10-17, **Primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves from generalized power-law non-canonical Higgs inflation**, Soma Heydari et.al., [2310.11030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11030v1)

 Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) could be promising candidate for not only the Dark Matter (DM) content of the universe but also the source of Gravitational Waves (GWs) observed by Ligo-Virgo. In the present work, generation of PBHs and secondary GWs from non-canonical Higgs inflation have been probed. It is elucidated that, Higgs potential in non-canonical setup with a generalized power-law Lagrangian density can source a consistent inflationary era with the latest observational data. Besides, we show that our model satisfies the swampland criteria. At the same time, defining a peaked function of inflaton field as non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(\phi)$ of the Lagrangian, gives rise to slow down the inflaton in a while. In this interim, namely Ultra-Slow-Roll (USR) stage, the amplitude of the curvature perturbations on small scales enlarges versus CMB scales. It has been illustrated that, further to the peaked aspect of the chosen non-canonical mass scale parameter, the amount of $\alpha$ parameter of the Lagrangian has enlarging impact on the amplitude of the scalar perturbations. As a consequence of adjusting three parameter Cases of this model, three Cases of PBHs in proper mass scopes to explain LIGO-VIRGO events, microlensing events in OGLE data and DM content in its totality, could be produced. It is indicated that, current density parameter spectra $(\Omega\_{\rm GW\_0})$ of the coeval GWs with these PBHs can be traced by various GWs observatories. In the end, power-law behavior of the spectra of $\Omega\_{\rm GW\_0}$ in terms of frequency has been examined. The logarithmic power index as $n=3-2/\ln(f\_c/f)$ in the infrared regime is obtained for each Case of the model.

2023-10-18, **Chemical Analysis of the Brightest Star of the Cetus II Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxy Candidate**, K. B. Webber et.al., [2310.12090v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12090v1)

 We present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of the brightest star in the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy candidate Cetus II from high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra. For this star, DES J011740.53-173053, abundances or upper limits of 18 elements from Carbon to Europium are derived. Its chemical abundances generally follow those of other UFD galaxy stars, with a slight enhancement of the alpha-elements (Mg, Si, and Ca) and low neutron-capture element (Sr, Ba, Eu) abundances supporting the classification of Cetus II as a likely UFD. The star exhibits lower Sc, Ti, and V abundances than Milky Way (MW) halo stars with similar metallicity. This signature is consistent with yields from a supernova (SN) originating from a star with a mass of ~11.2 solar masses. In addition, the star has a Potassium abundance of [K/Fe] = 0.81 which is somewhat higher than the K abundances of MW halo stars with similar metallicity, a signature which is also present in a number of UFD galaxies. A comparison including globular clusters (GC) and stellar stream stars suggests that high K is a specific characteristic for some UFD galaxy stars and can thus be used to help classify objects as UFD galaxies.

2023-10-18, **A measurement of the dark energy equation of state with 40 strong lenses**, Natalie B. Hogg et.al., [2310.11977v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11977v1)

 Problems with the cosmological constant model of dark energy motivate the investigation of alternative scenarios. I make the first measurement of the dark energy equation of state using the hierarchical strong lensing time delay likelihood provided by TDCOSMO. I find that the combination of seven TDCOSMO lenses and 33 SLACS lenses is only able to provide an upper bound on the dark energy equation of state, $w < -1.75$, which nevertheless implies the presence of a phantom dark energy component. When the strong lensing time delay data is combined with a collection of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillation and Type Ia supernova data, I find that the equation of state remains consistent with a cosmological constant.

2023-10-18, **The JWST Galactic Center Survey -- A White Paper**, Rainer Schoedel et.al., [2310.11912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11912v1)

 The inner hundred parsecs of the Milky Way hosts the nearest supermassive black hole, largest reservoir of dense gas, greatest stellar density, hundreds of massive main and post main sequence stars, and the highest volume density of supernovae in the Galaxy. As the nearest environment in which it is possible to simultaneously observe many of the extreme processes shaping the Universe, it is one of the most well-studied regions in astrophysics. Due to its proximity, we can study the center of our Galaxy on scales down to a few hundred AU, a hundred times better than in similar Local Group galaxies and thousands of times better than in the nearest active galaxies. The Galactic Center (GC) is therefore of outstanding astrophysical interest. However, in spite of intense observational work over the past decades, there are still fundamental things unknown about the GC. JWST has the unique capability to provide us with the necessary, game-changing data. In this White Paper, we advocate for a JWST NIRCam survey that aims at solving central questions, that we have identified as a community: i) the 3D structure and kinematics of gas and stars; ii) ancient star formation and its relation with the overall history of the Milky Way, as well as recent star formation and its implications for the overall energetics of our galaxy's nucleus; and iii) the (non-)universality of star formation and the stellar initial mass function. We advocate for a large-area, multi-epoch, multi-wavelength NIRCam survey of the inner 100\,pc of the Galaxy in the form of a Treasury GO JWST Large Program that is open to the community. We describe how this survey will derive the physical and kinematic properties of ~10,000,000 stars, how this will solve the key unknowns and provide a valuable resource for the community with long-lasting legacy value.

 Binary neutron star mergers (BNS) produce high-energy emissions from several physically different sources, including a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and its afterglow, a kilonova, and, at late times, a remnant many parsecs in size. Ionizing radiation from these sources can be dangerous for life on Earth-like planets when located too close. Work to date has explored the substantial danger posed by the GRB to on-axis observers: here we focus instead on the potential threats posed to nearby off-axis observers. Our analysis is based largely on observations of the GW 170817/GRB 170817A multi-messenger event, as well as theoretical predictions. For baseline kilonova parameters, we find that the X-ray emission from the afterglow may be lethal out to $\sim 5$ pc and the off-axis gamma-ray emission may threaten a range out to $\sim 4$ pc, whereas the greatest threat comes years after the explosion, from the cosmic rays accelerated by the kilonova blast, which can be lethal out to distances up to $\sim 11$ pc. The distances quoted here are typical, but the values have significant uncertainties and depend on the viewing angle, ejected mass, and explosion energy in ways we quantify. Assessing the overall threat to Earth-like planets, have a similar kill distance to supernovae, but are far less common. However, our results rely on the scant available kilonova data, and multi-messenger observations will clarify the danger posed by such events.

2023-10-17, **Some stars fade quietly: Varied Supernova explosion outcomes and their effects on the multi-phase interstellar medium**, Ulrich P. Steinwandel et.al., [2310.11495v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11495v1)

 We present results from galaxy evolution simulations with a mutiphase Interstellar medium (ISM), a mass resolution of $4$ M$\_{\odot}$ and a spatial resolution of 0.5 pc. These simulations include a stellar feedback model that includes the resolved feedback from individual massive stars and accounts for heating from the far UV-field, non-equilibrium cooling and chemistry and photoionization. In the default setting, individual supernova (SN) remnants are realized as thermal injections of $10^{51}$ erg; this is our reference simulation WLM-fid. Among the remaining seven simulations, there are two runs where we vary this number by fixing the energy at $10^{50}$ erg and $10^{52}$ erg (WLM-1e50 and WLM-1e52, respectively). We carry out three variations with variable SN-energy based on the data of Sukhbold et al. (2016) (WLM-variable, WLM-variable-lin, and WLM-variable-stoch). We run two simulations where only 10 or 60 percent of stars explode as SNe with $10^{51}$ erg, while the remaining stars do not explode (WLM-60prob and WLM-10prob). We find that the variation in the SN-energy, based on the tables of Sukhbold et al. (2016), has only minor effects: the star formation rate changes by roughly a factor of two compared to the fiducial run, and the strength of the galactic outflows in mass and energy only decreases by roughly 30 percent, with typical values of $\eta\_m \sim 0.1$ and $\eta\_e \sim 0.05$ (measured at a height of 3 kpc after the hot wind is fully decoupled from the galactic ISM). In contrast, the increase and decrease in the canonical SN-energy has a clear impact on the phase structure, with loading factors that are at least 10 times lower/higher and a clear change in the phase structure. We conclude that these slight modulations are driven not by the minor change in SN-energy but rather by the stochasticity of whether or not an event occurs when variable SN-energies are applied.

 When a compact object is formed, an impulse (kick) will be imparted to the system by the mass lost during the core-collapse supernova (SN). A number of other mechanisms may impart an additional kick on the system, although evidence for these natal kicks in black hole systems remains limited. Updated Gaia astrometry has recently identified a number of high peculiar velocity (in excess of Galactic motion) compact objects. Here, we focus on the black hole low-mass X-ray binary H 1705--250, which has a peculiar velocity $\upsilon\_{\mathrm{pec}}\,=\,221^{+101}\_{-108}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Using population synthesis to reconstruct its evolutionary history (assuming formation via isolated binary evolution within the Galactic plane), we constrain the properties of the progenitor and pre-SN orbit. The magnitude of a kick solely due to mass loss is found to be $\sim\,30\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which cannot account for the high present-day peculiar motion. We therefore deduce that the black hole received an additional natal kick at formation, and place limits on its magnitude, finding it to be $\sim\,295\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (minimum $90\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). This furthers the argument that these kicks are not limited to neutron stars.

2023-10-17, **Exploring Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration with EoS Parameterizations in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity via Baryon Acoustic Oscillations**, Madhur Khurana et.al., [2310.11413v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11413v1)

 In our study, we have adopted the framework of Horava-Lifshitz gravity to model the Universe's dark matter and dark energy components. Specifically, we have considered two recent parametrizations for dark energy models: the CBDRM-type and CADMM-type parameterizations. In our analysis, we have explicitly expressed the Hubble parameter, denoted as $H(z)$, for these two distinct dark energy models. By doing so, we have aimed to investigate and quantify the accelerated cosmic expansion rate characterizing the late-time Universe. Our study uses a wide range of datasets. This dataset consists of recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) collected over a period of twenty years with the Cosmic Chronometers (CC) dataset, Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) dataset, the Hubble diagram of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), quasars (Q), and the latest measurement of the Hubble constant (R22). Consequently, we present a crucial aspect of our study by plotting the $r\_{d}$ vs. $H\_{0}$ plane. In the context of the $\Lambda$CDM model, after incorporating all the datasets, including the R22 prior, we obtain the following results: $H\_{0}$ = $71.674089 \pm 0.734089$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r\_d = 143.050380 Mpc \pm 3.702038$. For the CBDRM model, we find $H\_{0}$ = $72.355058 \pm 1.004604$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r\_d = 144.835069 Mpc \pm 2.378848$. In the case of the CADMM model, our analysis yields $H\_{0}$ = $72.347804 \pm 0.923328$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r\_d = 144.466836 Mpc \pm 4.288758$. We have conducted cosmographic analyses for both of the proposed parameterizations in comparison to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Additionally, we have applied Diagnostic tests to investigate the evolution of both models. Finally, the Information Criteria test demonstrates that the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges as the preferred choice among the models we have considered.
