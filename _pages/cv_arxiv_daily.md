2024-02-28, **Minimal seesaw and leptogenesis with the smallest modular finite group**, Simone Marciano et.al., [2402.18547v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18547v1)

 We propose a model for leptons based on the smallest modular finite group $\Gamma\_2\cong S\_3$ that, for the first time, accounts for both the hints of large low-energy CP-violation in the lepton sector and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe, generated by only two heavy right-handed neutrinos. These same states are also employed in a Minimal seesaw mechanism to generate light neutrino masses. Besides the heavy neutrinos, our particle content is the same as the Standard Model (SM), with the addition of one single modulus $\tau$, whose vacuum expectation value is responsible for both the modular and CP-symmetry breakings. We show that this minimalistic SM extension is enough to get an excellent fit to low energy neutrino observables and to the required baryon asymmetry $\eta\_B$. Predictions for the neutrino mass ordering, effective masses in neutrinoless double beta decay and tritium decay as well as for the Majorana phases are also provided.

2024-02-28, **Dark matter bound-state formation in the Sun**, Xiaoyong Chu et.al., [2402.18535v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18535v1)

 The Sun may capture asymmetric dark matter (DM), which can subsequently form bound-states through the radiative emission of a sub-GeV scalar. This process enables generation of scalars without requiring DM annihilation. In addition to DM capture on nucleons, the DM-scalar coupling responsible for bound-state formation also induces capture from self-scatterings of ambient DM particles with DM particles already captured, as well as with DM bound-states formed in-situ within the Sun. This scenario is studied in detail by solving Boltzmann equations numerically and analytically. In particular, we take into consideration that the DM self-capture rates require a treatment beyond the conventional Born approximation. We show that, thanks to DM scatterings on bound-states, the number of DM particles captured increases exponentially, leading to enhanced emission of relativistic scalars through bound-state formation, whose final decay products could be observable. We explore phenomenological signatures with the example that the scalar mediator decays to neutrinos. We find that the neutrino flux emitted can be comparable to atmospheric neutrino fluxes within the range of energies below one hundred MeV. Future facilities like Hyper-K, and direct DM detection experiments can further test such scenario.

2024-02-28, **Towards a precision calculation of $N_{\rm eff}$ in the Standard Model III: Improved estimate of NLO corrections to the collision integral**, Marco Drewes et.al., [2402.18481v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18481v1)

 We compute the dominant QED correction to the neutrino-electron interaction rate in the vicinity of neutrino decoupling in the early universe, and estimate its impact on the effective number of neutrino species $N\_{\rm eff}$ in cosmic microwave background anisotropy observations. We find that the correction to the interaction rate is at the sub-percent level, consistent with a recent estimate by Jackson and Laine. Relative to that work we include the electron mass in our computations, but restrict our analysis to the enhanced $t$-channel contributions. The fractional change in $N\_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ due to the rate correction is of order $10^{-5}$ or below, i.e., about a factor of 30 smaller than that recently claimed by Cielo {\it et al.}, and below the nominal computational uncertainties of the current benchmark value of $N\_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM} = 3.0440 \pm 0.0002$. We therefore conclude that aforementioned number remains to be the state-of-the-art benchmark for $N\_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ in the standard model of particle physics.

2024-02-28, **Prospects for measuring time variation of astrophysical neutrino sources at dark matter detectors**, Yi Zhuang et.al., [2402.18454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18454v1)

 We study the prospects for measuring the time variation of solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes at future large-scale Xenon and Argon dark matter detectors. For solar neutrinos, a yearly time variation arises from the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, and, for charged current interactions, from a smaller energy-dependent day-night variation to due flavor regeneration as neutrinos travel through the Earth. For a 100-ton Xenon detector running for 10 years with a Xenon-136 fraction of $\lesssim 0.1\%$, in the electron recoil channel a time-variation amplitude of about 0.8\% is detectable with a power of 90\% and the level of significance of 10\%. This is sufficient to detect time variation due to eccentricity, which has amplitude of $\sim 3\%$. In the nuclear recoil channel, the detectable amplitude is about 10\% under current detector resolution and efficiency conditions, and this generally reduces to about 1\% for improved detector resolution and efficiency, the latter of which is sufficient to detect time variation due to eccentricity. Our analysis assumes both known and unknown periods. We provide scalings to determine the sensitivity to an arbitrary time-varying amplitude as a function of detector parameters. Identifying the time variation of the neutrino fluxes will be important for distinguishing neutrinos from dark matter signals and other detector-related backgrounds, and extracting properties of neutrinos that can be uniquely studied in dark matter experiments.

2024-02-28, **Grey Two-moment Neutrino Transport: Comprehensive Tests and Improvements for Supernova Simulations**, Haakon Andresen et.al., [2402.18303v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18303v1)

 In this work, we extended an energy-integrated neutrino transport method to facilitate efficient, yet precise, modeling of compact astrophysical objects. We focus particularly on core-collapse supernovae. We implemented the framework of Foucart et al. (2016) into FLASH and performed a detailed evaluation of its accuracy in core-collapse supernova simulations. Based on comparisons with results from simulations using energy-dependent neutrino transport, we incorporated several improvements to the original scheme. Our analysis shows that our grey neutrino transport method successfully reproduces key aspects from more complex energy-dependent transport across a variety of progenitors and equations of state. We find both qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement with multi-group M1 transport simulations. However, the grey scheme tends to slightly favor shock revival. In terms of gravitational wave and neutrino signals, there is a good alignment with the energy-dependent transport, although we find 15-30 percent discrepancies in the average energy and luminosity of heavy-lepton neutrinos. Simulations using the grey transport are around four times faster than those using energy-dependent transport.

2024-02-28, **Ultra-light Dark Matter Search with Astrophysical Neutrino Flavour**, Carlos A. Arg√ºelles et.al., [2402.18126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18126v1)

 The ultra-light dark matter is a new class of dark matter candidates. Unlike traditional dark matter particle candidates, the ultra-light dark matter behaves like a classical field, which saturates the entire Milky Way galaxy with a coherent oscillation. If such dark matter exists and couples with neutrinos, properties of astrophysical neutrinos propagating in the Milky Way would be modified and detectable by neutrino telescopes such as IceCube. Meantime, IceCube looked for quantum-gravity-motivated effects from the astrophysical neutrino flavour information. IceCube did not find evidence of new physics, and they set limits on neutrino - Lorentz violating field couplings. Here, we investigate if these results can be applied to limit the ultra-light dark matter couplings with neutrinos. It is found that the strong limits of neutrino-dark matter couplings in low dark matter mass regions can be obtained in this approach.

2024-02-28, **Characterization of the Astrophysical Diffuse Neutrino Flux using Starting Track Events in IceCube**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2402.18026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18026v1)

 A measurement of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino spectrum is presented using IceCube data collected from 2011-2022 (10.3 years). We developed novel detection techniques to search for events with a contained vertex and exiting track induced by muon neutrinos undergoing a charged-current interaction. Searching for these starting track events allows us to not only more effectively reject atmospheric muons but also atmospheric neutrino backgrounds in the southern sky, opening a new window to the sub-100 TeV astrophysical neutrino sky. The event selection is constructed using a dynamic starting track veto and machine learning algorithms. We use this data to measure the astrophysical diffuse flux as a single power law flux (SPL) with a best-fit spectral index of $\gamma = 2.58 ^{+0.10}\_{-0.09}$ and per-flavor normalization of $\phi^{\mathrm{Astro}}\_{\mathrm{per-flavor}} = 1.68 ^{+0.19}\_{-0.22} \times 10^{-18} \times \mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ (at 100 TeV). The sensitive energy range for this dataset is 3 - 550 TeV under the SPL assumption. This data was also used to measure the flux under a broken power law, however we did not find any evidence of a low energy cutoff.

2024-02-28, **Dark Scattering: accelerated constraints from KiDS-1000 with $\tt{ReACT}$ and $\tt{CosmoPower}$**, Karim Carrion et.al., [2402.18562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18562v1)

 We present constraints on the Dark Scattering model through cosmic shear measurements from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), using an accelerated pipeline with novel emulators produced with $\tt{CosmoPower}$. Our main emulator, for the Dark Scattering non-linear matter power spectrum, is trained on predictions from the halo model reaction framework, previously validated against simulations. Additionally, we include the effects of baryonic feedback from $\tt{HMcode2016}$, whose contribution is also emulated. We analyse the complete set of statistics of KiDS-1000, namely Band Powers, COSEBIs and Correlation Functions, for Dark Scattering in two distinct cases. In the first case, taking into account only KiDS cosmic shear data, we constrain the amplitude of the dark energy - dark matter interaction to be $\vert A\_{\rm ds} \vert \lesssim 20$ $\rm b/GeV$ at 68\% C.L. Furthermore, we add information from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from Planck, along with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from 6dFGS, SDSS and BOSS, approximating a combined weak lensing + CMB + BAO analysis. From this combination, we constrain $A\_{\rm ds} = 10.6^{+4.5}\_{-7.3}$ $\rm b/GeV$ at 68\% C.L. We confirm that with this estimated value of $A\_{\rm ds}$ the interacting model considered in this work offers a promising alternative to solve the $S\_8$ tension.

2024-02-28, **Dark matter from mediator decay in early matter domination**, Rouzbeh Allahverdi et.al., [2402.18557v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18557v1)

 We study dark matter production from mediator decays in scenarios with an epoch of early matter domination. Particles that mediate interactions between dark matter and the standard model particles are kinematically accessible to the thermal bath as long as their mass is below the reheating temperature of the Universe after inflation. Decay of on-shell mediators can then lead to copious production of dark matter during early matter domination or a preceding radiation-dominated phase. In particular, for mediators that are charged under the standard model, it can exceed the standard freeze-in channel due to inverse annihilations at much lower temperatures (often by many orders of magnitude). The requirement to obtain the correct relic abundance severely constrains the parameter space for dark matter masses above a few TeV.

2024-02-28, **Primordial Rotating Disk Composed of $\geq$15 Dense Star-Forming Clumps at Cosmic Dawn**, S. Fujimoto et.al., [2402.18543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18543v1)

 Early galaxy formation, initiated by the dark matter and gas assembly, evolves through frequent mergers and feedback processes into dynamically hot, chaotic structures. In contrast, dynamically cold, smooth rotating disks have been observed in massive evolved galaxies merely 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang, suggesting rapid morphological and dynamical evolution in the early Universe. Probing this evolution mechanism necessitates studies of young galaxies, yet efforts have been hindered by observational limitations in both sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here we report high-resolution observations of a strongly lensed and quintuply imaged, low-luminosity, young galaxy at $z=6.072$ (dubbed the Cosmic Grapes), 930 million years after the Big Bang. Magnified by gravitational lensing, the galaxy is resolved into at least 15 individual star-forming clumps with effective radii of $r\_{\rm e}\simeq$ 10--60 parsec (pc), which dominate $\simeq$ 70\% of the galaxy's total flux. The cool gas emission unveils a smooth, underlying rotating disk characterized by a high rotational-to-random motion ratio and a gravitationally unstable state (Toomre $Q \simeq$ 0.2--0.3), with high surface gas densities comparable to local dusty starbursts with $\simeq10^{3-5}$ $M\_{\odot}$/pc$^{2}$. These gas properties suggest that the numerous star-forming clumps are formed through disk instabilities with weak feedback effects. The clumpiness of the Cosmic Grapes significantly exceeds that of galaxies at later epochs and the predictions from current simulations for early galaxies. Our findings shed new light on internal galaxy substructures and their relation to the underlying dynamics and feedback mechanisms at play during their early formation phases, potentially explaining the high abundance of bright galaxies observed in the early Universe and the dark matter core-cusp problem.

2024-02-28, **Exploring Charge Transport Dynamics in a Cryogenic P-Type Germanium Detector**, P. Acharya et.al., [2402.18388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18388v1)

 This study explores the dynamics of charge transport within a cryogenic P-type Ge particle detector, fabricated from a crystal cultivated at the University of South Dakota (USD). By subjecting the detector to cryogenic temperatures and an Am-241 source, we observe evolving charge dynamics and the emergence of cluster dipole states, leading to the impact ionization process at 40 mK. Our analysis focuses on crucial parameters: the zero-field cross-section of cluster dipole states and the binding energy of these states. For the Ge detector in our investigation, the zero-field cross-section of cluster dipole states is determined to be $8.45 \times 10^{-11}\pm 4.22\times 10^{-12}~cm^2$. Examination of the binding energy associated with cluster dipole states, formed by charge trapping onto dipole states during the freeze-out process, reveals a value of $0.034 \pm 0.0017$ meV. These findings shed light on the intricate charge states influenced by the interplay of temperature and electric field, with potential implications for the sensitivity in detecting low-mass dark matter.

2024-02-28, **Galaxy clustering at cosmic dawn from JWST/NIRCam observations to redshift z$\sim$11**, Nicol√≤ Dalmasso et.al., [2402.18052v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18052v1)

 We report measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function at cosmic dawn, using photometrically-selected sources from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The JWST/NIRCam dataset comprises approximately $N\_g \simeq 7000$ photometrically-selected Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs), spanning from $z=5.5$ up to $z=10.6$. The primary objective of this study is to extend clustering measurements beyond redshift $z>10$, finding a galaxy bias $b=9.6\pm1.7$ for the sample at $\overline{z} = 10.6$. The result suggests that the observed sources are hosted by dark matter halos of approximately $M\_{h}\sim 10^{10.5}~\mathrm{M\_{\odot}}$, in broad agreement with theoretical and numerical modelling of early galaxy formation during the epoch of reionization. Furthermore, the JWST JADES dataset enables an unprecedented investigation of clustering of dwarf galaxies two orders of magnitude fainter than the characteristic $L\_*$ luminosity (i.e. with $M\_{F200W}\simeq-14.5$) during the late stages of the epoch of reionization at $z\sim 6$. By measuring clustering versus luminosity, we observe that $b(M\_{F200W})$ initially decreases with $M\_{F200W}$ as theoretically expected, but a turning point of the relationship is seen at $M\_{F200W} \sim -16$. We interpret the rise of clustering of the faintest dwarf as evidence of multiple halo occupation (i.e. as a one-halo term in bias modelling). These initial results demonstrate the potential for further quantitative characterisation of the interplay between assembly of dark matter and light during cosmic dawn that the growing samples of JWST observations are enabling.

2024-02-28, **Spatial Distribution of Intracluster Light versus Dark Matter in Horizon Run 5**, Jaewon Yoo et.al., [2402.17958v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17958v1)

 One intriguing approach for studying the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters is to compare the spatial distributions among various components, such as dark matter, member galaxies, gas, and intracluster light (ICL). Utilizing the recently introduced Weighted Overlap Coefficient (WOC) \citep{2022ApJS..261...28Y}, we analyze the spatial distributions of components within 174 galaxy clusters ($M\_{\rm tot}> 5 \times 10^{13} M\_{\odot}$, $z=0.625$) at varying dynamical states in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon Run 5. We observe that the distributions of gas and the combination of ICL with the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) closely resembles the dark matter distribution, particularly in more relaxed clusters, characterized by the half-mass epoch. The similarity in spatial distribution between dark matter and BCG+ICL mimics the changes in the dynamical state of clusters during a major merger. Notably, at redshifts $>$ 1, BCG+ICL traced dark matter more accurately than the gas. Additionally, we examined the one-dimensional radial profiles of each component, which show that the BCG+ICL is a sensitive component revealing the dynamical state of clusters. We propose a new method that can approximately recover the dark matter profile by scaling the BCG+ICL radial profile. Furthermore, we find a recipe for tracing dark matter in unrelaxed clusters by including the most massive satellite galaxies together with BCG+ICL distribution. Combining the BCG+ICL and the gas distribution enhances the dark matter tracing ability. Our results imply that the BCG+ICL distribution is an effective tracer for the dark matter distribution, and the similarity of spatial distribution may be a useful probe of the dynamical state of a cluster.

2024-02-28, **Origin of broad He II 4686√Ö emission in early spectra of type IIP supernovae**, Nikolai Chugai et.al., [2402.18299v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18299v1)

 We propose a model for the origin of the broad He II 4686A emission in the early spectrum of type II SN~2020jfo. The 4686A line is emitted presumably by dense fragments embedded into a hot gas of the forward shock wave. The fragments are produced as a result of a heavy braking of the dense low-mass shell at the ejecta boundary and a simultaneous Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The temperature of line-emitting fragments is $\approx$5$\times10^4$K. Calculations of ionization and excitation of helium and hydrogen account for the He II 4686A luminosity, the large flux ratio of He II 4686A/H$\alpha$, and a significant optical depth of the 4686A line. We demonstrate that fragments heating by hot electrons behind the forward shock compensates cooling via the HeII 304A emission.

2024-02-28, **From Simulations to Reality: Dark Energy Reconstruction with Simulated SNIa data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory**, Ayan Mitra et.al., [2402.18124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18124v1)

 In this paper, we present an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based reconstruction analysis of the Supernova Ia (SNIa) distance moduli ($\mu(z)$), and hence dark energy, using LSST simulated three-year SNIa data. Our ANN reconstruction architecture can model both the distance moduli and their corresponding error estimates. For this we employ astroANN and incorporate Monte Carlo dropout techniques to quantify uncertainties in our predictions. We tune our hyperparameters through advanced genetic algorithms, including elitism, utilizing the DEAP library. We compared the performance of the ANN based reconstruction with two theoretical descriptions of dark energy models, $\Lambda$CDM and Chevallier-Linder-Polarski (CPL). We perform a Bayesian analysis for these two theoretical models using the LSST simulations and also compare with observations from Pantheon and Pantheon+ SNIa real data. We show that our model-independent reconstruction using ANN is consistent with both of them. We assessed the performance using mean squared error (MSE) and showed that the ANN can produce distance estimates in better agreement with the LSST dataset than either $\Lambda$CDM or CPL, albeit very small. We included an additional residual analysis and a null test with $F$-scores to show that the reconstructed distances from the ANN model, are in excellent agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM or CPL model.

2024-02-28, **Missing Titanium in the Asymmetric Supernova Remnant W49B**, Toshiki Sato et.al., [2402.17957v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17957v1)

 The progenitor of the W49B supernova remnant is still under debate. One of the candidates is a jet-driven core-collapse supernova. In such a highly asymmetric explosion, a strong $\alpha$-rich freezeout is expected in local high entropy regions, which should enrich elements synthesized by the capture of $\alpha$-particles such as $^{44}$Ti and $^{48}$Cr (decaying to $^{44}$Ca and $^{48}$Ti, respectively). In the present work, in order to infer the progenitor of the W49B remnant, we constrain the amount of stable Ti ($^{48}$Ti) synthesized, using the {\it Suzaku} observation. We found no firm evidence for the Ti line and set the upper limit of $M\_{\rm Ti}/M\_{\rm Fe} < 8.2 \times$ 10$^{-4}$ (99\% limit using Xspec) and $M\_{\rm Ti}/M\_{\rm Fe} < 1.9 \times$ 10$^{-3}$ (99\% limit using SPEX), and thus excluded almost all hypernova/jet-driven supernova models. Our results, as complemented by some previous studies, suggest that a Type Ia supernova from a near-$M\_{\rm Ch}$ (Chandrasekhar mass) white dwarf is the most favorable candidate for the origin of W49B. Future observations with X-ray calorimeter missions, such as XRISM, will give us a stronger constraint on the progenitor.
