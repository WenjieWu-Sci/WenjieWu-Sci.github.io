2024-01-11, **Precision test of the weak interaction with slow muons**, Xin Chen et.al., [2401.05945v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05945v1)

 We propose to use slow muons facilities combined with cyclotron radiation detection for precision test of the weak interaction in the muon decays. Slow positive muon bunches are first injected into a cylindrical superconducting vacuum chamber with uniform strong axial magnetic fields to radially confine the muons. The positrons resulting from muon decays can be detected by their cyclotron radiation, which can be transported to low-noise electronic devices through waveguides coupled to the chamber. The decay positron's energy can be precisely measured down to eV level in the low energy region, which is sensitive to new physics effects such as Majorana neutrinos and new structures of weak interactions.

2024-01-11, **Effects on neutrino propagation in space-time foam of D-branes revisited**, Chengyi Li et.al., [2401.05867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05867v1)

 Neutrinos from the cosmos have proven to be ideal for probing the nature of space-time. Previous studies on high-energy events of IceCube suggested that some of these events might be gamma-ray burst neutrinos, with their speeds varying linearly with their energy, implying also the coexistence of subluminal and superluminal propagation. However, a recent reanalysis of the data, incorporating revised directional information, reveals stronger signals that neutrinos are actually being slowed down compared to previous suggestion of neutrino speed variation. Thus, it is worth discussing its implications for the brane/string inspired framework of space-time foam, which has been used to explain previous observations. We revisit effects on neutrino propagation from specific foam models within the framework, indicating that the implied violation of Lorentz invariance could necessarily cause the neutrino to decelerate. We therefore argue that this sort of model is in agreement with the updated phenomenological indication just mentioned. An extended analysis of the revised IceCube data will further test these observations and stringy quantum gravity.

2024-01-11, **Gamma-rays and Neutrinos from Giant Molecular Cloud Populations in the Galactic Plane**, Abhijit Roy et.al., [2401.05863v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05863v1)

 The recent detection of significant neutrino flux from the inner Galactic plane by the IceCube detector has provided us valuable insights on the spectrum of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. This flux can be produced either by a population of Galactic point sources or by diffused emission from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium or by a mixture of both. In this work, we compute diffused gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes produced by a population of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in our Galaxy, assuming different parametrizations of the Galactic diffused cosmic ray distribution. In particular, we take into account two main cases: (I) constant cosmic ray luminosity in our Galaxy, and (II) space-dependent cosmic ray luminosity based on the supernovae distribution in our Galaxy. For Case-I, we found that the neutrino flux from GMCs is a factor of $\sim 10$ below compared to $\pi^0$ and KRA$\_\gamma$ best-fitted models of IceCube observations at $10^5$ GeV. Instead, for Case-II the model can explain up to $\sim 90 \%$ of the neutrino flux at that energy. Moreover, for this scenario IceCube detector could be able to detect neutrino events from the Galactic centre regions. We then calculated the gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from individual GMCs and noticed that several current and future Cherenkov telescopes and neutrino observatories have the right sensitivities to study these objects. In particular, very neutrino-bright region such as Aquila Rift is favourable for detection by the IceCube-Gen2 observatory.

2024-01-11, **Gravity limits the kinetic energy of a massive elementary particle**, Justin C. Feng et.al., [2401.05764v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05764v1)

 In this note, I describe a gravitational effect that generically limits the kinetic energy of a single massive elementary particle in the vicinity of a compact object. In the rest frame of a scattering trajectory, tidal accelerations have a quadratic dependence on the specific kinetic energy. As the kinetic energy is increased, the differences in the tidal potential over a Compton wavelength will at some point become large enough to create additional particles. A straightforward calculation reveals that neutrinos scattering off a $10 M\_\odot$ black hole within three Schwarzschild radii are roughly limited to about $1~\text{GeV}$, so that an incident neutrino of significantly higher energy passing through such a region decays into a shower of neutrinos with individual energies below the threshold.

2024-01-11, **Triplet scalar flavored leptogenesis with spontaneous CP violation**, Sreerupa Chongdar et.al., [2401.05699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05699v1)

 The inclusion of two triplet scalars in the Standard Model (SM) enables to accommodate neutrino mass generation as well as baryogenesis through leptogenesis. One of the essential ingredients of leptogenesis is the violation of charge conjugation and parity (CP) symmetry in lepton number-violating decays of the triplet scalars. We work on the promising sector of spontaneous CP violation (SCPV) which is manifested by the involvement of one scalar singlet and two scalar fields, added to the SM. The predictive aspect of the model is accomplished by imposing $A\_4 \times Z\_4$ symmetry which results in the traditional tribimaximal mixing pattern. With updated data on neutrino oscillation, we study the parameter space of the model. The phase of the complex vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the singlet scalar acts as the common source of CP violation in both low and high-energy sectors. Due to the flavor symmetry of the model, required baryon asymmetry cannot be accomplished via unflavored leptogenesis. In the temperature regime, $\left[ 10^{9}, 10^{12} \right]$ GeV when flavor effects become important in the study of leptogenesis, it is shown that baryogenesis is achievable. The rich flavor interplay is explored through the study of the density matrix equations. We also study the interplay of hierarchical branching ratios of the decay of the triplet scalars and SCPV phase to accommodate the required CP asymmetry to account for the final baryon asymmetry in the observational range. Considering all possible mass hierarchies among the triplet scalars, the flavor structure of the triplet Yukawa couplings results in different scales of leptogenesis.

2024-01-11, **Elastic scattering of supernova neutrinos with electrons in xenon**, Pijushpani Bhattacharjee et.al., [2401.05644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05644v1)

 Neutrinos from a Galactic core collapse supernova can undergo elastic scattering with electrons in xenon atoms in liquid xenon based dark matter detectors giving rise to electrons of kinetic energy up to a few MeV. We calculate the scattered electron spectrum and the number of such elastic scattering events expected for a typical Galactic core collapse supernova in a xenon target. Although the expected number of events is small (compared to, for example, inelastic neutrino-nucleus charged current interaction with xenon nuclei, that also gives rise to final state electrons), the distinct spectral shape of the scattered electrons may allow identification of the elastic scattering events. Further, while the process is dominated by neutrinos and antineutrinos of electron flavor, it receives contributions from all the six neutrino species. Identification of the electron scattering events may, therefore, allow an estimation of the relative fractions of the total supernova explosion energy going into electron flavored and non-electron flavored neutrinos.

2024-01-11, **Post-Newtonian effects in compact binaries with a dark matter spike: A Lagrangian approach**, Diego Montalvo et.al., [2401.06084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06084v1)

 We present a simple but powerful Lagrangian method that can be used to study the post-Newtonian evolution of a compact binary system with environment, including a dark matter spike, around it, and obtain the resulting gravitational wave emission. This formalism allows one to incorporate post-Newtonian effects up to any desired known order, as well as any other environmental effect around the binary, as long as their dissipation power or force formulae are known. In particular, in this work, we employ this method to study a black hole-black hole binary system of mass ratio $10^5$, by including post-Newtonian effects of order 1PN and 2.5PN as well as the effect of relativistic dynamical friction. We obtain the modified orbits and the corresponding modified gravitational waveform. Finally, we contrast these modifications against the LISA sensitivity curve in frequency space and show that this observatory can detect the associated signals.

2024-01-11, **Bursting with Feedback: The Relationship between Feedback Model and Bursty Star Formation Histories in Dwarf Galaxies**, Bianca Azartash-Namin et.al., [2401.06041v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06041v1)

 We use high-resolution cosmological simulations to compare the effect of bursty star formation histories on dwarf galaxy structure for two different subgrid supernovae (SNe) feedback models in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses from $5000 <$ M$\_*$/M$\_\odot$ $< 10^{9}$. Our simulations are run using two distinct supernova feedback models: superbubble and blastwave. We show that both models are capable of producing galaxies that are cored and reproduce observed scaling relations for metallicity, luminosity, mass, and size. We show that continuous bursty star formation and the resulting stellar feedback are able to sustain dark matter cores in the higher dwarf galaxy mass regime, while the majority of ultra-faint and classical dwarfs retain cuspy central dark matter density profiles. We find that both subgrid SN models are able to create bursty star formation histories. We find that effective core formation peaks at M$\_*$/M$\_\odot$ $\simeq 5 \times 10^{-3}$ for both feedback models. Galaxies simulated with superbubble feedback peak at lower mean burstiness values relative to blastwave feedback, indicating that core formation in the superbubble sample may be less motivated by the burstiness of star formation.

2024-01-11, **Constraints on Dark Matter Self-Interactions from weak lensing of galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey around clusters from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Survey**, Susmita Adhikari et.al., [2401.05788v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05788v1)

 Self--interactions of dark matter particles impact the distribution of dark matter in halos. The exact nature of the self--interactions can lead to either expansion or collapse of the core within the halo lifetime, leaving distinctive signatures in the dark matter distributions not only at the halo center but throughout the virial region. Optical galaxy surveys, which precisely measure the weak lensing of background galaxies by massive foreground clusters, allow us to directly measure the matter distribution within clusters and probe subtle effects of self--interacting dark matter (SIDM) throughout the halo's full radial range. We compare the weak--lensing measurements reported by Shin et al. 2021, which use lens clusters identified by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Survey and source galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey, with predictions from SIDM models having either elastic or dissipative self--interactions. To model the weak--lensing observables, we use cosmological N-body simulations for elastic self--interactions and semi-analytical fluid simulations for dissipative self--interactions. We find that current weak--lensing measurements already constrain the isotropic and elastic SIDM to a cross-section per mass of $\sigma/m<1~{\rm cm^2/g}$ at a $95\%$ confidence level. The same measurements also impose novel constraints on the energy loss per unit mass for dissipative SIDM. Upcoming surveys are anticipated to enhance the signal-to-noise of weak--lensing observables significantly making them effective tools for investigating the nature of dark matter, including self--interactions, through weak lensing.

2024-01-11, **Images of hairy Reissner-Nordström black hole illuminated by static accretions**, Yuan Meng et.al., [2401.05634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05634v1)

 In this paper, we investigate the shadow and optical appearance of the hairy Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black hole illuminated by two toy models of static accretion. The hairy RN black hole describes the deformation of a Schwarzschild black hole due to the inclusion of additional arbitrary source (scalar field, tensor field, fluidlike dark matter, etc.), which is characterized by the parameters: mass ($M$), deformation factor ($\alpha$), electric charge ($Q$) and the additional hairy charge ($l\_o$). We find that for the hairy RN black hole, the event horizon, radius of photon sphere and critical impact parameter all increase as the increasings of $Q$ and $l\_o$,but decrease as $\alpha$ grows. Furthermore, the three characterized parameters are found to have significant effects on the photon trajectories, and shadows as well as images of the hairy RN black hole surrounded by the static accretion disk and spherical accretion, respectively. In particular, both $Q$ and $l\_o$ have mutually reinforcing effects on the optical appearance and shadows of the hairy RN black hole, which implies that we may not distinguish the electric charge and hairy charge from the shadow and image of black hole in this scenario. Additionally, because of the competing effects of the charge parameters ($Q, l\_o$) and the deviation parameter $\alpha$ on the observed intensities of brightness, the optical appearance between the hairy RN black hole and RN black hole could have degeneracies, indicating the indistinguishability.

2024-01-11, **Probing the Diversity of Type Ia Supernova Light Curves in the Open Supernova Catalog**, Chang Bi et.al., [2401.06087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06087v1)

 The ever-growing sample of observed supernovae enhances our capacity for comprehensive supernova population studies, providing a richer dataset for understanding the diverse characteristics of Type Ia supernovae and possibly that of their progenitors. Here, we present a data-driven analysis of observed Type Ia supernova photometric light curves collected in the Open Supernova Catalog. Where available, we add the environmental information from the host galaxy. We focus on identifying sub-classes of Type Ia supernovae without imposing the pre-defined sub-classes found in the literature to date. To do so, we employ an implicit-rank minimizing autoencoder neural network for developing low-dimensional data representations, providing a compact representation of the supernova light curve diversity. When we analyze light curves alone, we find that one of our resulting latent variables is strongly correlated with redshift, allowing us to approximately ``de-redshift'' the other latent variables describing each event. After doing so, we find that three of our latent variables account for $\sim$95\% of the variance in our sample, and provide a natural separation between 91T and 91bg thermonuclear supernovae. Of note, the 02cx subclass is not unambiguously delineated from the 91bg sample in our results, nor do either the over-luminous 91T or the under-luminous 91bg/02cx samples form a clearly distinct population from the broader sample of ``other'' SN Ia events. We identify the physical characteristics of supernova light curves which best distinguish SNe 91T from SNe 91bg \& 02cx, and discuss prospects for future refinements and applications to other classes of supernovae as well as other transients.

2024-01-11, **Bursting with Feedback: The Relationship between Feedback Model and Bursty Star Formation Histories in Dwarf Galaxies**, Bianca Azartash-Namin et.al., [2401.06041v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06041v1)

 We use high-resolution cosmological simulations to compare the effect of bursty star formation histories on dwarf galaxy structure for two different subgrid supernovae (SNe) feedback models in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses from $5000 <$ M$\_*$/M$\_\odot$ $< 10^{9}$. Our simulations are run using two distinct supernova feedback models: superbubble and blastwave. We show that both models are capable of producing galaxies that are cored and reproduce observed scaling relations for metallicity, luminosity, mass, and size. We show that continuous bursty star formation and the resulting stellar feedback are able to sustain dark matter cores in the higher dwarf galaxy mass regime, while the majority of ultra-faint and classical dwarfs retain cuspy central dark matter density profiles. We find that both subgrid SN models are able to create bursty star formation histories. We find that effective core formation peaks at M$\_*$/M$\_\odot$ $\simeq 5 \times 10^{-3}$ for both feedback models. Galaxies simulated with superbubble feedback peak at lower mean burstiness values relative to blastwave feedback, indicating that core formation in the superbubble sample may be less motivated by the burstiness of star formation.

2024-01-11, **Probing diversity of type II supernovae with the Chinese Space Station Telescope**, Han Lin et.al., [2401.05910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05910v1)

 Type II supernovae (SNe II), which show abundant hydrogen in their spectra, belong to a class of SNe with diverse observed properties. It is commonly accepted that SNe II are produced by core collapse and explosion of massive stars. However, the large photometric and spectroscopic diversity of SNe II, and the mechanisms responsible for these diversities, have not been thoroughly understood. In this review, we first briefly introduce the optical characteristics and possible progenitors of each subtype of SNe II. We then highlight the role of the Chinese Space Station Telescope in future SN studies. With a deep limiting magnitude, the main survey project could detect SN IIP-like objects as distant as $z\sim 1.2$, and obtain UV-optical follow-up for peculiar transients, especially those long-lived events. With a high resolution and a large field of view, the main survey camera is powerful in linking a nearby SN with its progenitor, while the integral field spectrograph is powerful in revealing the SN environment. All this information has the potential to help enrich our understanding of supernova physics.

2024-01-11, **A spectral data release for 104 Type II Supernovae from the Tsinghua Supernova Group**, Han Lin et.al., [2401.05889v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05889v1)

 We present 206 unpublished optical spectra of 104 type II supernovae obtained by the Xinglong 2.16m telescope and Lijiang 2.4m telescope during the period from 2011 to 2018, spanning the phases from about 1 to 200 days after the SN explosion. The spectral line identifications, evolution of line velocities and pseudo equivalent widths, as well as correlations between some important spectral parameters are presented. Our sample displays a large range in expansion velocities. For instance, the Fe~{\sc ii} $5169$ velocities measured from spectra at $t\sim 50$ days after the explosion vary from ${\rm 2000\ km\ s^{-1}}$ to ${\rm 5500\ km\ s^{-1}}$, with an average value of ${\rm 3872 \pm 949\ km\ s^{-1}}$. Power-law functions can be used to fit the velocity evolution, with the power-law exponent quantifying the velocity decline rate. We found an anticorrelation existing between H$\beta$ velocity at mid-plateau phase and its velocity decay exponent, SNe II with higher velocities tending to have smaller velocity decay rate. Moreover, we noticed that the velocity decay rate inferred from the Balmer lines (i.e., H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$) have moderate correlations with the ratio of absorption to emission for H$\alpha$ (a/e). In our sample, two objects show possibly flash-ionized features at early phases. Besides, we noticed that multiple high-velocity components may exist on the blue side of hydrogen lines of SN 2013ab, possibly suggesting that these features arise from complex line forming region. All our spectra can be found in WISeREP and Zenodo.

2024-01-11, **Intermediate-luminosity Type IIP SN 2021gmj: a low-energy explosion with signatures of circumstellar material**, Yuta Murai et.al., [2401.05837v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05837v1)

 We present photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric observations of the intermediate-luminosity Type IIP supernova (SN) 2021gmj from 1 to 386 days after the explosion. The peak absolute V-band magnitude of SN 2021gmj is -15.5 mag, which is fainter than that of normal Type IIP SNe. The spectral evolution of SN 2021gmj resembles that of other sub-luminous supernovae: the optical spectra show narrow P-Cygni profiles, indicating a low expansion velocity. We estimate the progenitor mass to be about 12 Msun from the nebular spectrum and the 56Ni mass to be about 0.02 Msun from the bolometric light curve. We also derive the explosion energy to be about 3 x 10^{50} erg by comparing numerical light curve models with the observed light curves. Polarization in the plateau phase is not very large, suggesting nearly spherical outer envelope. The early photometric observations capture the rapid rise of the light curve, which is likely due to the interaction with a circumstellar material (CSM). The broad emission feature formed by highly-ionized lines on top of a blue continuum in the earliest spectrum gives further indication of the CSM at the vicinity of the progenitor. Our work suggests that a relatively low-mass progenitor of an intermediate-luminosity Type IIP SN can also experience an enhanced mass loss just before the explosion, as suggested for normal Type IIP SNe.
