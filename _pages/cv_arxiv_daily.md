2024-09-16, **Neutrino yield and neutron shielding calculations for a high-power target installed in an underground setting**, Adriana Bungau et.al., [2409.10211v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10211v1)

 With the ever increasing beam power at particle accelerator-based facilities for nuclear and particle physics, radioactive isotope production, and nuclear engineering, targets that can withstand this power, and shielding of secondary particles are becoming increasingly important. Here we present Monte Carlo (MC) calculations using the well-established Geant4 software to optimise and predict the antineutrino yield of a $^8$Li Decay-At-Rest (DAR) source. The source relies on 600~kW of beam power from a continuous wave proton beam impinging on a beryllium target, where spallation neutrons capture on $^7$Li to produce the $^8$Li. We further present an in-depth treatment of the neutron shielding surrounding this target. We show that we can produce the high antineutrino flux needed for the discovery-level experiment IsoDAR, searching for ``sterile'' neutrinos (predicted new fundamental particles) and other beyond standard model physics, while maintaining a neutron flux in the detector that is below natural backgrounds. The methods presented in this paper are easily transferable to other high-power targets and their associated shielding.

2024-09-16, **Neutrino Model in Left-Right Symmetric Linear Seesaw Augmented with $A_4$ Modular Group**, Raktima Kalita et.al., [2409.10195v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10195v1)

 In this work, we have implemented $A\_4$ modular symmetry in the left-right symmetric linear seesaw model. Interestingly, such modular symmetry restricts the proliferation of flavon fields, and as a result, the predictibility of the model is enhanced. The fermion sector of the model comprises of quarks, leptons and a sterile fermion in each generation, while the scalar sector consists of Higgs doublets and bidoublets. We investigate numerically various Yukawa coupling co-efficients, the neutrino masses and mixing parameters in our intended model and predictions become consistent with $3\sigma$ range of current neutrino oscillation data. We also studied the non-unitarity, effects on lepton flavor violation in our model and evolution of lepton asymmetry to explain the current baryon asymmetry of the universe.

2024-09-16, **Neutrino theory: open questions and future opportunities**, Raymond R. Volkas et.al., [2409.09992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09992v1)

 The subtitle of my talk is ``The quest for understanding the origin of neutrino masses''. After reviewing why the discovery of neutrino masses is also the discovery of New Physics, the substance of the talk details mechanisms for generating Majorana neutrino masses and implications for experimental searches and/or cosmology. I review high-scale seesaw, low-scale seesaw and radiative mechanisms, asking at every turn how testable the scenario is. While it is clear that determining the origin of neutrino masses -- knowing what Lagrangian to put into textbooks -- is a distant and ambitious goal, I end with experimental advances that we can reasonably hope for that would constitute progress.

2024-09-16, **The Three Hundred: The existence of massive dark matter-deficient satellite galaxies in cosmological simulations**, Ana Contreras-Santos et.al., [2409.10356v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10356v1)

 The observation of a massive galaxy with an extremely low dark matter content (i.e. NGC 1277) has posed questions about how such objects form and evolve in a hierarchical universe. We here report on the finding of several massive, dark matter-deficient galaxies in a set of 324 galaxy clusters theoretically modelled by means of full-physics hydrodynamical simulations. We first focus on two example galaxies selected amongst the most massive and dark matter-deficient ones. By tracing the evolution of these galaxies, we find that their lack of dark matter is a result of multiple pericentre passages. While orbiting their host halo, tidal interactions gradually strip away dark matter while preserving the stellar component. A statistical analysis of all massive satellite galaxies in the simulated clusters shows that the stellar-to-total mass ratio today is strongly influenced by the number of orbits and the distance at pericentres. Galaxies with more orbits and closer pericentres are more dark matter-deficient. Additionally, we find that massive, dark matter-deficient galaxies at the present day are either the remnants of very massive galaxies at infall or former central galaxies of infalling groups. We conclude that such massive yet dark matter-deficient galaxies exist and are natural by-products of typical cluster galaxy evolution, with no specific requirement for an exotic formation scenario.

2024-09-16, **A Common Origin for Nano-Hz Gravitational Wave Background and Black Hole Merger Events**, Bo-Qiang Lu et.al., [2409.10251v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10251v1)

 We explore the potential primordial connection between the black hole merger events detected by LIGO and the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays. We propose an innovative mechanism for the formation of primordial black holes, suggesting that the Poisson fluctuations within the domain wall network can give rise to horizon-sized overdense regions. Our results indicate a plausible common origin for gravitational wave observations in two different frequency bands, potentially linked to the annihilation of the domain wall network at the QCD scale, while accounting for the accretion effects on primordial black holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bias potential induced by the QCD instanton effect may naturally facilitate the annihilation of the domain wall network during the QCD phase transition. Additionally, our scenario can yield the correct axion dark matter relic abundance, particularly if realized within the clockwork axion framework.

2024-09-16, **Shedding light on Dark Sectors with high-energy muons at the NA64 experiment at the CERN SPS**, Yu. M. Andreev et.al., [2409.10128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10128v1)

 A search for Dark Sectors is performed using the unique M2 beam line at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. New particles ($X$) could be produced in the bremsstrahlung-like reaction of high energy 160 GeV muons impinging on an active target, $\mu N\rightarrow\mu NX$, followed by their decays, $X\rightarrow\text{invisible}$. The experimental signature would be a scattered single muon from the target, with about less than half of its initial energy and no activity in the sub-detectors located downstream the interaction point. The full sample of the 2022 run is analyzed through the missing energy/momentum channel, with a total statistics of $(1.98\pm0.02)\times10^{10}$ muons on target. We demonstrate that various muon-philic scenarios involving different types of mediators, such as scalar or vector particles, can be probed simultaneously with such a technique. For the vector-case, besides a $L\_\mu-L\_\tau$ $Z'$ vector boson, we also consider an invisibly decaying dark photon ($A'\rightarrow\text{invisible}$). This search is complementary to NA64 running with electrons and positrons, thus, opening the possibility to expand the exploration of the thermal light dark matter parameter space by combining the results obtained with the three beams.

2024-09-16, **Detection of Dark Matter Coherent Scattering via Torsion Balance with Test Bodies of Different Sizes**, Shigeki Matsumoto et.al., [2409.09950v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09950v1)

 Dark matter with mass in the crossover range between wave dark matter and particle dark matter, around $(10^{-3},\, 10^3)\,$eV, remains relatively unexplored by terrestrial experiments. In this mass regime, dark matter scatters coherently with macroscopic objects. The effect of the coherent scattering greatly enhances the accelerations of the targets that the dark matter collisions cause by a factor of $\sim 10^{23}$. We propose a novel torsion balance experiment with test bodies of different geometric sizes to detect such dark matter-induced acceleration. This method provides the strongest constraints on the scattering cross-section between the dark matter and a nucleon in the mass range $(10^{-5}, 10^3)\,$eV.
