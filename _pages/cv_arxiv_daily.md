2023-05-18, **Cogenesis of matter and dark matter from triplet fermion seesaw**, Satyabrata Mahapatra et.al., [2305.11138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11138v1)

 We propose a simple model in the type-III seesaw framework to explain the recently reported W-mass anomaly by CDF-II collaboration, neutrino mass, asymmetric dark matter, and baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We extend the standard model with a vector-like singlet lepton ($\chi$) and a hypercharge zero scalar triplet ($\Delta$) in addition to three hypercharge zero triplet fermions($\Sigma\_i~,i=1,2,3$). A $Z\_2$ symmetry is imposed under which $\chi$ and $\Delta$ are odd, while all other particles are even. As a result, the lightest $Z\_2$ odd particle $\chi$ behaves as a candidate of dark matter. In the early Universe, the CP-violating out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy triplet fermions to the Standard Model lepton ($L$) and Higgs ($H$) generate a net lepton asymmetry, while that of triplet fermions to $\chi$ and $\Delta$ generate a net asymmetric dark matter. The lepton asymmetry is converted to the required baryon asymmetry of the Universe via the electroweak sphalerons, while the asymmetry in $\chi$ remains as a dark matter relic that we observe today. We introduce a singlet scalar $\phi$, with mass $m\_\phi < m\_\chi$, which not only assists to deplete the symmetric component of $\chi$ through the annihilation process: $\bar{\chi} \chi \to \phi \phi$ but also paves a path to detect dark matter $\chi$ at direct search experiments through $\phi-H$ mixing. The $Z\_2$ symmetry is broken softly resulting in an unstable asymmetric dark matter with mass ranging from a few MeV to a few tens of GeV. The softly broken $Z\_2$ symmetry also induces a vacuum expectation value (vev) of $\Delta$ due to which the asymmetry in $\Delta$ disappears. Moreover, the vev of $\Delta$ enhances the W-boson mass as reported by CDF-II collaboration with $7\sigma$ statistical significance, while keeping the $Z$-boson mass intact.

2023-05-18, **Production of $p$-nuclei from $r$-process seeds: the $νr$-process**, Zewei Xiong et.al., [2305.11050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11050v1)

 We present a new nucleosynthesis process that may take place on neutron-rich ejecta experiencing an intensive neutrino flux. The nucleosynthesis proceeds similarly to the standard $r$-process, a sequence of neutron-captures and beta-decays, however with charged-current neutrino absorption reactions on nuclei operating much faster than beta-decays. Once neutron capture reactions freeze-out the produced $r$-process neutron-rich nuclei undergo a fast conversion of neutrons into protons and are pushed even beyond the $\beta$-stability line producing the neutron-deficient $p$-nuclei. This scenario, which we denote as the $\nu r$-process, provides an alternative channel for the production of $p$-nuclei and the short-lived nucleus $^{92}$Nb. We discuss the necessary conditions posed on the astrophysical site for the $\nu r$-process to be realized in nature. While these conditions are not fulfilled by current neutrino-hydrodynamic models of $r$-process sites, future models, including more complex physics and a larger variety of outflow conditions, may achieve the necessary conditions in some regions of the ejecta.

2023-05-18, **Probing Non-Standard Neutrino Interactions with Interference: Insights from Dark Matter and Neutrino Experiments**, Jong-Chul Park et.al., [2305.10836v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10836v1)

 Neutrino-electron scattering experiments play a crucial role in investigating the non-standard interactions of neutrinos. In certain models, these interactions can include interference terms that may affect measurements. Next-generation direct detection experiments, designed primarily for dark-matter searches, are also getting sensitive to probe the neutrino properties. We utilise the data from XENONnT, a direct detection experiment, and Borexino, a low-energy solar neutrino experiment, to investigate the impact of interference on non-standard interactions. Our study considers models with an additional $U(1)$, including $U(1)\_{B-L}$, $U(1)\_{L\_e-L\_\mu}$, and $U(1)\_{L\_e-L\_\tau}$, to investigate the impact of interference on non-standard neutrino interactions. We demonstrate that this interference can lead to a transition between the considered non-standard interaction models in the energy range relevant to both the XENONnT and Borexino experiments. This transition can be used to distinguish among the considered models if any signals are observed at direct detection or neutrino experiments. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for the interference and incorporating both direct detection and solar neutrino experiments to gain a better understanding of neutrino interactions and properties.

2023-05-18, **Bubble-assisted Leptogenesis**, Eung Jin Chun et.al., [2305.10759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10759v1)

 The typical mass scale of the lightest right-handed neutrino (RHN), in the thermal leptogenesis paradigm, is bounded from below at about $10^{11} \text{ GeV}$ due to a "strong washout" of the final asymmetry without a tuning of parameters. In this work, we explore the possibility of embedding thermal leptogenesis within a first-order phase transition (FOPT) such that RHNs remain massless until a FOPT arises. Their sudden and violent mass gain allows the neutrinos to become thermally decoupled, and the lepton asymmetry generated from their decay can be, in principle, free from the strong wash-out processes that conventional leptogenesis scenarios suffer from, albeit at the cost of new washout channels. We numerically quantify to what extent such a framework can alleviate strong-washout effects and we find the lower bound on the RHN mass, $M\_N \sim 10^{7}\text{ GeV}$, below which bubble-assisted leptogenesis cannot provide an enhancement. We also study the signature possibly observable at GW terrestrial interferometers and conclude that bubble-assisted leptogenesis models with relatively light masses, $M\_N \lesssim 5\times 10^9 \text{ GeV}$ may be probable.

2023-05-18, **Lepto-hadronic interpretation of 2021 RS Ophiuchi nova outburst**, Agnibha De Sarkar et.al., [2305.10735v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10735v1)

 Very high energy (VHE; 100 GeV $<$ E $\leq$ 100 TeV) and high energy (HE; 100 MeV $<$ E $\leq$ 100 GeV) gamma-rays were observed from the symbiotic recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) during its outburst in August 2021, by various observatories such as High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC), and {\it Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT). The models explored so far tend to favor a hadronic scenario of particle acceleration over an alternative leptonic scenario. This paper explores a time-dependent lepto-hadronic scenario to explain the emission from the RS Oph source region. We have used simultaneous low frequency radio data observed by various observatories, along with the data provided by H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and \textit{Fermi}-LAT, to explain the multi-wavelength (MWL) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) corresponding to 4 days after the outburst. Our results show that a lepto-hadronic interpretation of the source not only explains the observed HE-VHE gamma-ray data but the corresponding model synchrotron component is also consistent with the first 4 days of low radio frequency data, indicating the presence of non-thermal radio emission at the initial stage of nova outburst. We have also calculated the expected neutrino flux from the source region and discussed the possibility of detecting neutrinos.

2023-05-18, **Lepton flavor violating decays $l_j\rightarrow l_i γγ$**, Ming-Yue Liu et.al., [2305.10663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10663v1)

 In this paper, we study the lepton flavor violating decays (LFV) of the $l\_j\rightarrow l\_i \gamma\gamma$ (j=2, 3; i=1, 2) processes under the $U(1)\_X$SSM model. The $U(1)\_X$SSM is the addition of three singlet new Higgs superfields and right-handed neutrinos to the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM). Based on the latest experimental constraints of $l\_j\rightarrow l\_i \gamma\gamma$, we analyze the effects of different sensitive parameters on the results and made reasonable predictions for future experimental development. Numerical analysis shows that many parameters have a greater or lesser effect on LFV, but the main sensitive parameters and sources leading to LFV are the non-diagonal elements involving the initial and final leptons. This work could provide a basis for the discovery of the existence of new physics (NP).

2023-05-18, **Cosmology with a supersymmetric local $B-L$ model**, Kwang Sik Jeong et.al., [2305.11143v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11143v1)

 We propose a minimal gauged $U(1)\_{B-L}$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) which resolves the cosmological moduli problem via thermal inflation, and realizes late-time Affleck-Dine leptogensis so as to generate the right amount of baryon asymmetry at the end of thermal inflation. The present relic density of dark matter can be explained by sneutrinos, MSSM neutralinos, axinos, or axions. Cosmic strings from $U(1)\_{B-L}$ breaking are very thick, and so the expected stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic string loops has a spectrum different from the one in the conventional Abelian-Higgs model, as would be distinguishable at least at LISA and DECIGO. The characteristic spectrum is due to a flat potential, and may be regarded as a hint of supersymmetry. Combined with the resolution of moduli problem, the expected signal of gravitational waves constrains the $U(1)\_{B-L}$ breaking scale to be $\mathcal{O}(10^{12-13})\,{\rm GeV}$. Interestingly, our model provides a natural possibility for explaining the observed ultra-high-energy cosmic rays thanks to the fact that the core width of strings in our scenario is very large, allowing a large enhancement of particle emissions from the cusps of string loops. Condensation of $LH\_u$ flat-direction inside of string cores arises inevitably and can also be the main source of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays accompanied by ultra-high-energy lightest supersymmetric particles.

2023-05-18, **Equilibrium dynamical models for the Large Magellanic Cloud**, Nikolay Kacharov et.al., [2305.10980v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10980v1)

 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has a complex dynamics driven by both internal and external processes. The external forces are due to tidal interactions with the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way, while internally its dynamics mainly depends on the stellar, gas, and dark matter mass distributions. Despite the overall complexity of the system, very often simple physical models can give us important insights about the main driving factors. Here we focus on the internal forces and attempt to model the proper motions of $\sim10^6$ stars in the LMC as measured by Gaia Data Release 3 with an axisymmetric dynamical model, based on the Jeans equations. We test both cored and cusped spherical Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halos to fit the LMC gravitational potential. We find that this simple model is very successful at selecting a clean sample of genuine LMC member stars and predicts the geometry and orientation of the LMC with respect to the observer within the constraint of axisymmetry. Our Jeans dynamical models describe well the rotation profile and the velocity dispersion of the LMC stellar disc, however they fail to describe the motions of the LMC bar, which is a non-axisymmetric feature dominating the central region. We plan a triaxial Schwarzschild approach as a next step for the dynamical modelling of the LMC.

2023-05-18, **Dark matter condensates as highly nonlocal solitons: instability in the Schwarzschild metric and laboratory analog**, Ludovica Dieli et.al., [2305.10780v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10780v1)

 Theories on the bosonic nature of dark matter are a promising alternative to the cold dark matter model. Here we consider a dark matter halo in the state of a Bose-Einstein condensate, subject to the gravitation of a black hole. In the low energy limit, we bring together the general relativity in the Schwarzschild metric and the quantum description of the Bose-Einstein condensate. The model is solvable in the Fermi normal coordinates with the so called highly nonlocal approximation and describes tidal deformations in the condensate wave function. The black hole deforms the localized condensate until the attraction of the compact object overcomes the self-gravitation and destabilizes the solitonic dark matter. Moreover, the model can be implemented as a gravitational analog in the laboratory; the time-dependent potential generated by the galactic black hole can be mimicked by an optical trap acting on a conventional condensate. The results open the way to new laboratory simulators for quantum gravitational effects.

2023-05-18, **Multiple Peaks and a Long Precursor in the Type IIn Supernova 2021qqp: An Energetic Explosion in a Complex Circumsteller Environment**, Daichi Hiramatsu et.al., [2305.11168v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11168v1)

 We present detailed optical photometry and spectroscopy of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2021qqp. Its unusual light curve is marked by a long gradual brightening (i.e., precursor) for about 300 days, a rapid increase in brightness for about 60 days, and then a sharp increase of about 1.6 mag in only a few days to a first peak of $M\_r\approx -19.5$ mag. The light curve then turns over and declines rapidly, until it re-brightens to a second distinct and sharp peak with $M\_r\approx -17.3$ mag centered at about 335 days after the first peak. The spectra are dominated by Balmer-series lines with a complex morphology that includes a narrow component with a width of $\approx 1300$ km s$^{-1}$ (first peak) and $\approx 2500$ km s$^{-1}$ (second peak) that we associate with the circumstellar medium (CSM), and a P Cygni component with an absorption velocity of $\approx 8500$ km s$^{-1}$ (first peak) and $\approx 5600$ km s$^{-1}$ (second peak) that we associate with the SN-CSM interaction shell. Using the bolometric light curve and velocity evolution, we construct an analytical model to extract the CSM profile and SN properties. We find two significant mass-loss episodes with peak mass loss rates of $\approx 10$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\approx 5$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ about 0.8 and 2 years before explosion, and a total CSM mass of $\approx 2-4\,M\_\odot$. We show that the most recent mass-loss episode can explain the precursor for the year preceding the explosion. The SN ejecta mass is constrained to be $M\_{\rm SN}\approx 5-30\,M\_\odot$ for an explosion energy of $E\_{\rm SN}\approx (3-10)\times10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$. We discuss eruptive massive stars (luminous blue variable, pulsational pair instability) and an extreme stellar merger with a compact object as possible progenitor channels for generating the energetic explosion in the complex CSM environment.
