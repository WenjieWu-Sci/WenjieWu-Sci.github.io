2026-02-11, **Demonstration and performance of an online data selection algorithm for liquid argon time projection chambers using MicroBooNE**, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., [2602.11138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11138v1)

 The MicroBooNE detector is a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) that produces three-dimensional images of particle interactions using ionization charge collected by anode wire plane arrays and scintillation light collected by a light detection system. In addition to testing long-standing experimental neutrino anomalies and performing measurements of neutrino interactions with argon nuclei using the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam, MicroBooNE aims to develop methodologies for rare beyond the Standard Model and off-beam physics searches. Looking ahead to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), with MicroBooNE serving as a valuable testbed, achieving high sensitivity and livetime for off-beam physics while satisfying data processing and storage constraints will require data-driven, intelligent, and online or real-time data selection techniques. These techniques are essential for reducing data rates and preserving rare signals with high accuracy. In this paper, we describe a fast data selection algorithm suitable for online execution to identify electrons from stopping cosmic ray muons in the MicroBooNE detector utilizing ionization charge information, and present its performance. This represents the first demonstration of online data selection in a LArTPC using real data and charge information exclusively and provides an important proof-of-principle for applying such techniques to other LArTPC experiments such as the Short-Baseline Near Detector and DUNE.

2026-02-11, **Sterile neutrino dark matter in conformal Majoron models**, João Gonçalves et.al., [2602.11085v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11085v1)

 We study sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) in a classically conformal U(1)' extension of the Standard Model with three right-handed neutrinos and a Majoron-like singlet scalar that generate the observed pattern of active neutrino masses and mixing via the type-I seesaw mechanism. Working in the regime of strongly suppressed active-sterile mixing, we show that the observed DM abundance can be produced through freeze-in from feeble interactions mediated by the heavy Z' and the conformal scalar. We solve the Boltzmann equation for the nonthermal phase-space distribution and confront the scenario with Lyman-$α$ data by computing the matter power spectrum. For keV-scale sterile neutrinos we identify the viable parameter space consistent with structure-formation and X-ray bounds, including regions compatible with a tentative 3.5 keV line. If a second sterile state is long-lived, late decays can realize a two-component setup that alleviates the $S\_8$ tension. In a highly fine-tuned variant of the model, the 220 PeV KM3NeT event can also be explained by invoking the decay of a superheavy sterile neutrino.

2026-02-11, **Application of a high-precision distributed uranium source for determining the effective mass and volume of a HPGe detector**, A. S. Barabash et.al., [2602.10759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10759v1)

 A distributed uranium source with the accurately certified activity of 238U has been used to verify the effective mass of the HPGe detector intended for the νGeN neutrino experiment. The source, dissolved in nitric acid, provides homogeneous irradiation of the detector crystal allowing the study of its mass and volume. The experimental spectra obtained with the distributed source have been compared to the detailed Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations. The measured counting rates of several gamma-lines agree with the simulated efficiencies, confirming that the detector mass and volume coincide with the manufacturer specifications. The results demonstrate the applicability of such sources for mass calibration of HPGe detectors.

2026-02-10, **Evidence for neutrino emission from X-ray Bright Seyfert Galaxies in the Southern Hemisphere using Enhanced Starting Track Events with IceCube**, The IceCube Collaboration et.al., [2602.10208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10208v1)

 IceCube recently reported the observation of TeV neutrinos from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC~1068, and the corresponding neutrino flux is significantly higher than the upper limit implied by observations of GeV-TeV gamma rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced near the supermassive black hole, where the radiation density is high enough to obscure gamma rays. We use a set of muon neutrinos with interaction vertices inside the detector, which have good sensitivity to sources in the Southern sky, from IceCube data recorded between 2011 and 2021. We then search for individual and collective neutrino signals from 14 Seyfert galaxies in the Southern Sky selected from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN Spectroscopic Survey. Using the correlations between keV X-rays and TeV neutrinos predicted by disk-corona models, and assuming production characteristics similar to NGC~1068, a collective neutrino signal search reveals an excess of $6.7\_{-3.2}^{+4.0}$ events, which is inconsistent with background expectations at the 3$σ$ level of significance. In this paper, we present new independent evidence that Seyfert galaxies contribute to the extragalactic flux of high-energy neutrinos.

2026-02-10, **The supernova remnant J0450.4-7050 possesses a jets-shaped point-symmetric morphology**, Noam Soker et.al., [2602.09993v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09993v1)

 By examining recently published images in different wavelengths, I identify a point-symmetric morphology in the Large Magellanic Cloud core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) J0450.4-7050 (SNR 0450-70.9; nicknamed Veliki), which I attribute to at least three pairs of energetic jets that participated in the explosion of the progenitor in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). Two pairs of ears, a pair of blowouts in the north and south along the long axis of this SNR, and a pair of dents compose the point symmetric morphology. The fact that the symmetry axes of two pairs include pairs of opposite structural features in the inner ejecta implies that the shaping is by jets and not due to an interaction with an ambient material. While the JJEM predicts such morphologies, the competing neutrino-driven mechanism cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies. This study provides strong support for the claim that the JJEM is the primary CCSN explosion mechanism.

2026-02-10, **Cosmological signature and light Dark Matter in Dirac $L_μ-L_τ$ model**, Pritam Das et.al., [2602.09962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09962v1)

 We revisit an anomaly-free extension of the Standard Model (SM) $viz.$ gauged ${L\_μ-L\_τ}$ model in the Dirac framework, where the local $U(1)\_{L\_μ-L\_τ}$ symmetry breaks and gives rise to a new gauge boson $Z'$ and corresponding gauge coupling $g\_{μτ}$. Three additional heavy vector-like fermions, three light right-handed neutrinos and two heavy singlet scalars are added to complete the model framework for Dirac neutrinos. Another singlet vector-like fermion is added with a new gauge charge, which serves as a viable DM candidate, and the correct relic abundance is obtained via the resonance effect. The parameter space is considered after satisfying the current bounds on $M\_{Z'}$ and the gauge coupling $g\_{μτ}$. The influence of dark radiations coming from the additional light degrees of freedoms are studied in connection with the dark matter. After imposing all relevant theoretical and experimental constraints, the allowed parameter space is found to be highly restricted yet still accessible to ongoing and near-future experiments, rendering the scenario strongly predictive. Moreover, clear correlations among the relevant observables emerge throughout this study, making the model testable in current and future experimental searches.

2026-02-10, **Study of $B^+ \to μ^+ ν_μ$ decays at Belle and Belle II**, Belle et.al., [2602.09800v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09800v1)

 We report a measurement of the branching fraction for the leptonic decay $B^+\toμ^+ν\_μ$. This work presents the first $B^+\toμ^+ν\_μ$ result using Belle~II data, an updated Belle measurement that supersedes the previous result, and their combination, which yields the most precise search to date. The analysis is based on $1076\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data collected at a center-of-mass energy of $10.58\,\mathrm{GeV}$ with the Belle and Belle~II detectors at the KEKB and SuperKEKB colliders, respectively. We measure $\mathcal{B}(B^+\toμ^+ν\_μ)=(4.4\pm1.9\pm 1.0)\times10^{-7}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. The observed significance relative to the background-only hypothesis is 2.4 standard deviations. We set a 90\% confidence level upper limit of $\mathcal{B}(B^+\toμ^+ν\_μ)<6.7\times10^{-7}$ using a frequentist approach and a 90\% credibility level upper limit of $\mathcal{B}(B^+\toμ^+ν\_μ)<7.2\times 10^{-7}$ using a Bayesian approach. These are the most stringent limits to date. The result is interpreted as an exclusion region in the parameter space of type~II and type~III two-Higgs-doublet models. We search for stable sterile neutrinos with masses $m\_N\in[0,1.5]\,\mathrm{GeV}$. No signal is observed, and the resulting exclusion on the squared mixing parameter $\|U\_{μN}\|^2$ provides improvement over previous limits. We report a measurement of the partial branching fraction of semileptonic $B\to X\_u\ellν\_\ell$ decays with $p\_μ^B>2.2\,\mathrm{GeV}$, obtaining $Δ\mathcal{B}(B\to X\_u\ellν\_\ell)=(2.72\pm0.05\pm0.29)\times10^{-4}$. We present a model-dependent study of weak annihilation decays using the muon momentum spectrum. We observe a signal of 2.4 standard deviations above the background-only hypothesis in regions where the distribution resembles that of $B\to X\_u\ellν\_\ell$ decays.

2026-02-11, **Light to Heavy, Brief to Eternal: An Axion for Every Occasion (in the Early Universe)**, Francesco D'Eramo et.al., [2602.11121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11121v1)

 The early universe grants access to energy scales far beyond those achievable in terrestrial experiments and allows unstable Standard Model particles to play an active dynamical role. In this contribution, we focus on recent studies aimed at quantifying the potential of the early universe to probe the properties and interactions of axions. The discussion is organized around four classes of axion scenarios, ordered from long to short lifetimes: (i) stable or long-lived axions contributing to dark radiation; (ii) stable or long-lived axions produced out-of-equilibrium and constituting dark matter; (iii) metastable axions whose decays inject energy into the primordial plasma and leave observable signatures in the global 21 cm signal; and (iv) very short-lived axions that act only as portals to additional degrees of freedom. Together, these scenarios highlight the interplay between axion phenomenology and early universe cosmology and demonstrate the potential of cosmological data to probe axions over a broad range of masses and lifetimes.

2026-02-11, **Early Architecture Concepts for the Habitable Worlds Observatory -- System Design, Modeling, and Analysis**, Alice et.al., [2602.11046v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11046v1)

 The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), NASA's next flagship science mission, follows in the tradition of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and other preceding great observatories. HWO will directly image and characterize Earth-like exoplanet and their atmospheres, with the capability to detect biosignatures and potentially answer the question of whether we are we alone. HWO will also serve as a powerful general astrophysics observatory, enabling breakthroughs in galaxy evolution, stellar astrophysics, and dark matter studies. Currently in pre-formulation, the project has established Exploratory Analytic Cases (EACs), a series of architectural concept designs used to assess the mission's demanding science objectives while exploring challenging engineering parameters. This paper describes the first three EACs, starting with observing strategies and error budget formulation and then progressing to design formulations, trade studies and lessons learned; this paper also discusses the integrated modeling pipeline, a key multidisciplinary system-level analysis capability, and analysis findings as applied to the first EAC. These activities set the stage for the follow on EACs 4 and 5, which will further explore the trade space and prepare for the baseline design that will support the Mission Concept Review (MCR).

2026-02-11, **The high speed analog optical readout system designed for low temperature experiments**, Z. Zhou et.al., [2602.10596v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10596v1)

 For low-temperature experiments such as liquid xenon dark matter detectors, it is crucial to read out detector signals from cryostats. Traditionally, photoelectrical signals are transmitted from the cryogenic region to the outside using coaxial cables through vacuum feedthroughs on the cryostats. In this paper, we investigate an analog optical transmission method in which the raw electrical signals are converted into optical signals with light intensity linearly proportional to the electrical amplitude, transmitted out of the cryogenic environment through optical fiber, and subsequently converted back into electrical signals by photoelectric devices while preserving the signal waveform. This new approach offers advantages, including low attenuation over long-distance transmission and reduced crosstalk across the feedthroughs. Additionally, the low-temperature optical wavelength multiplexing scheme has been investigated and applied, increasing the transmission capability of a single fiber. At -100 degree Celsius, the proposed analog optical readout system achieves a -3dB bandwidth of larger than 150MHz, a dynamic range of up to 500mV, and a low cryogenic-region power consumption of 70mW per channel, demonstrating its strong potential for low-temperature experiments.

2026-02-11, **Geometric properties of slowly rotating black holes embedded in matter environments**, Sayak Datta et.al., [2602.10579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10579v1)

 Astrophysical black holes are embedded in surrounding dark and baryonic matter that can measurably perturb the spacetime. We construct a self-consistent spacetime describing a slowly rotating black hole embedded in an external matter distribution, modeling the surrounding dark matter halo as an anisotropic fluid. Working within the slow-rotation approximation, we capture leading-order spin and frame-dragging effects while retaining analytic transparency. We show that the presence and rotation of the halo induce distinct deviations from the vacuum black hole geometry, modifying inertial frame dragging, equatorial circular geodesics, the light ring, the innermost stable circular orbit, and radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. These effects produce systematic shifts in orbital constants of motion and the locations of epicyclic resonances. In particular, the epicyclic frequency ratios develop nonmonotonic behavior, such as local minima. We further demonstrate that these features depend on the angular velocity of the surrounding fluid, reflecting the interplay between environmental gravity and frame dragging. Our results demonstrate that environmental and rotational effects can leave observable imprints on precision strong-field probes, particularly extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where small corrections accumulate over many orbital cycles. This work provides a minimal and extensible framework for incorporating realistic astrophysical environments into strong-field tests of gravity with future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.

2026-02-11, **Unidentified falling objects in the LHC as dark matter signals**, Xunyu Liang et.al., [2602.10562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10562v1)

 Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs) refer to sporadic beam losses observed during LHC operation. The prevailing explanation is that micrometer-sized dust particles released from the beam screen produce beam losses through interactions with the protons. However, the release mechanism of these particles remains unknown. We propose that roughly $(1-10)$% of UFOs may be caused by axion quark nuggets (AQNs), macroscopic dark matter (DM) candidates with masses of order $(5-1000)\,$g. The AQN model naturally relates the dark- and visible-matter abundances ($Ω\_\mathrm{DM}\simΩ\_\mathrm{visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry, with DM composed of both matter and antimatter AQNs. When passing underground within approximately 100km of the LHC, an antimatter AQN generates acoustic waves strong enough to trigger multiple UFO events within $2\,$s. If three correlated UFOs (placed at different locations along the LHC ring) are detected, the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed 5 across the entire allowed AQN mass range for a measurement time of about 360 hours. Practically, the LHC can serve as a large broadband acoustic detector for AQNs.

2026-02-10, **Cosmological production of dark matter in the Universe and in the laboratory**, Álvaro Parra-López et.al., [2602.10331v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10331v1)

 This thesis investigates cosmological particle production within Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes, both as a dark matter mechanism and through analog simulations using Bose-Einstein condensates. While a full theory of Quantum Gravity remains elusive, studying quantum fields on curved backgrounds provides essential insights into the early Universe. We focus on how dynamical spacetimes, particularly during inflation, generate particles from spectator fields influenced solely by geometry.   The work is divided into four parts. Part I establishes the theoretical framework, covering cosmology, inflation, and the principles of analog gravity. Part II analyzes particle production in various inflationary models, showing that scalar and vector fields can account for observed dark matter abundance, especially through tachyonic instabilities. Part III explores BEC experiments, mapping phonons to scalar fields in expanding universes. We demonstrate the reconstruction of expansion histories, reinterpret production as a scattering problem, and propose methods to measure entanglement between produced pairs. Finally, Part IV addresses quantum vacuum ambiguities and the impact of non-adiabatic transitions during the "switch-on" and "switch-off" of expansion.   Ultimately, this work highlights the viability of cosmological particle production for dark matter and the power of analog experiments to enhance our understanding of quantum effects in curved spacetimes.

2026-02-10, **Gravitational scalar production with a generic reheating scenario**, Francesco Costa et.al., [2602.10215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10215v1)

 Gravitational production of decoupled scalars during inflationary and post-inflationary phases is efficient and can lead to over-production. We study this production with various reheating scenarios such as a generic power-law inflaton potential $V\_{\rm inf}\propto φ^k$ as well as a multi-stage reheating scenario. We derive constraints on the scalar self-interaction coupling $λ\_s$, the mass $m\_s$, and coefficients of quantum gravity-induced operators. We find that the constraints depend sensitively on the reheating dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that universal gravity effects do not necessarily spoil the predictivity of non-thermal dark matter scenarios with $k < 4$ and low reheating temperatures, as an extended reheating phase dilutes gravitationally-produced relics. For $k > 4$, on the other hand, the relic abundance is enhanced during the reheating phase, leading to stringent constraints on the scalar. In multi-stage reheating, we show that the enhancement/dilution effect of subsequent reheating phases factorises.

2026-02-10, **The Keck/DEIMOS Stellar Archive: II. Dynamical Masses and Metallicities for a Uniform Sample of Milky Way Satellites**, Marla Geha et.al., [2602.10202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10202v1)

 Population-level studies of Milky Way satellites used to constrain dark matter or the threshold of galaxy formation often rely on velocity dispersions and metallicities derived from heterogeneous spectroscopic analyses. Systematic differences between data reduction pipelines and membership criteria can masquerade as astrophysical signals, or obscure real trends. Here, we present the largest self-consistent sample of spectroscopically-derived quantities for Milky Way satellite galaxies and globular clusters based on a homogeneous re-analysis of individual stars observed with the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph. We determine enclosed dynamical masses, mean [Fe/H] metallicities, and metallicity dispersions for 67 systems with 10 or more member stars. At a given stellar mass, systems classified as satellite galaxies are well separated from globular clusters in their dynamical mass and mass-to-light ratios. The average enclosed mass densities of satellite galaxies agree with semi-analytic CDM model predictions. For satellite galaxies, we observe a break in the stellar mass-metallicity relation near log M*/Msun = 4 (M\_V ~ -4.5). Above this stellar mass, satellite galaxies show the well-known tight trend (0.16 dex scatter in [Fe/H]) of decreasing metallicity with stellar mass; below log M*/Msun = 4, the mass-metallicity relation flattens and/or increases in scatter. Satellite galaxies have internal metallicity scatter between 0.3-0.4 dex across our stellar mass range. These uniform measurements will enable tighter constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relation, improved J-factor estimates for dark matter searches, and lay a foundation for interpreting the flood of new Milky Way satellites expected in the LSST/Roman/Euclid era.

2026-02-10, **Pushing the Limits of Atomic Dark Matter: First-Principles Recombination Rates and Cosmological Constraints**, Jared Barron et.al., [2602.10197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10197v1)

 Minimal atomic dark matter with its distinctive cooling mechanisms offers an instructive framework for understanding the potential impact of dark matter on small-scale structure formation and early cosmology. The model consists of two fermions with opposite charges under a hidden Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)\_{D}$ and masses $m\_{p\_{D}}$ and $m\_{e\_{D}}$, respectively. Analogous to hydrogen in the Standard Model, these fermions interact via their own electromagnetic-like force, with a dark fine structure constant denoted by $α\_{D}$, and can bind into neutral atomic (and molecular) dark states. Previous work has largely focused on the benchmark scenario where the dark sector mirrors ordinary matter, with $m\_{e\_{D}}$ near the electron mass, $m\_{p\_{D}}$ near the proton mass, and $α\_{D}\sim 1/137$. We extend this analysis by investigating dark recombination and cooling physics across the full parameter space of masses and couplings. Combining Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck and ACT with BAO and Pantheon+ data, we place new constraints on the atomic dark matter parameter space, identifying regions where acoustic damping and recombination dynamics leave observable imprints on the CMB.

2026-02-10, **The stellar-to-halo mass relation of central galaxies across three orders of halo mass**, Victoria Toptun et.al., [2602.10193v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10193v1)

 The stellar content of galaxies is tightly connected to the mass and growth of their host dark matter halos. Observational constraints on this relation remain limited, particularly for low-mass groups, leaving uncertainties in how galaxies assemble their stars across halo mass scales. Accurately measuring the brightest central galaxy (BCG) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) over a wide mass range is therefore crucial for understanding galaxy formation and the role of feedback processes. Here we present the SHMR spanning $M\_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12}$-$10^{15}\,M\_\odot$, using halo masses derived from eROSITA eRASS1 X-ray data and BCG stellar masses based on SDSS photometry. By stacking X-ray spectra of optically selected groups, we recover robust average halo gas temperatures for each bin, which are then converted to halo masses via the $M$-$T\_X$ relation. We find that the SHMR peaks near $M\_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12}\,M\_\odot$, with a declining stellar fraction at higher masses. This trend reflects a combination of processes that reduce the efficiency of stellar mass growth in massive halos, such as AGN feedback, reduced cooling efficiency, and the increasing dominance of ex-situ assembly, while halos continue to grow through mergers and accretion. Our measurements are consistent over the full mass range with previous observational studies, including weak lensing, X-ray analyses of individual clusters, and kinematical and dynamical methods. Comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations show good agreement at low masses but reveal significant discrepancies in the normalization at cluster scales, highlighting the sensitivity of BCG stellar growth to feedback prescriptions and halo assembly history. These results provide the first X-ray-based observational SHMR covering three orders of magnitude in halo mass, establish a robust benchmark for testing galaxy formation models.

2026-02-10, **Minimal Freeze-in Dark Matter: Reviving electroweak doublet dark matter with Boltzmann suppressed freeze-in**, Nicolás Bernal et.al., [2602.10112v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10112v1)

 Dark matter communicating with the Standard Model solely via electroweak interactions provides a compelling picture. However, thermal freeze-out of electroweak doublet dark matter is generically strongly excluded by direct detection. We show that SU(2)${}\_L$ doublet fermion dark matter evades direct detection if its mass exceeds $10^{10}$ GeV. If the neutral Dirac fermion is split into a pseudo-Dirac pair (via high dimension operator) this limit can be relaxed to 300 GeV. Provided the dark matter mass is above the reheat temperature of the Universe, the production rate never exceeds the Hubble rate in cases of interest, thus the dark matter never thermalizes. We apply constraints from direct detection (e.g. LZ) and consider the discovery potential of Darwin. This scenario presents the most minimal model of freeze-in dark matter, and is both elegant and highly predictive.

2026-02-10, **Massive disk galaxies with high surface brightness plus low surface brightness stellar disks, hosted by massive dark matter halo -- a TNG50 simulation study**, Suchira Sarkar et.al., [2602.09773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09773v1)

 We study massive disk galaxies (total stellar mass$>=10^{11}$ $\mathrm{M\_{\odot}}$) from IllustrisTNG50 simulation, and perform 2-D structural decomposition of the galaxies using their idealised, synthetic SDSS images for z=0. We find an interesting sample of galaxies having a central high surface brightness (HSB) stellar disk, surrounded by an extended low surface brightness (LSB) stellar disk, similar to giant LSB galaxies. These massive, double-exponential disk galaxies are found to be hosted by dark matter haloes of $\sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M\_{\odot}}$ in agreement to observations of such galaxies. Their maximum rotation velocity, an approximate measure of their dynamical mass, lies within $\sim$ (300-500) km/s. The stellar-to-dark matter mass ratio and the baryon-to-dark matter mass ratio of the sample lies in the range of $\sim$ (0.04 - 0.46) and $\sim$ (0.07 - 0.47) respectively. Our results show that cosmological simulations are able to form disc galaxies with HSB plus LSB disks, as in observations.

2026-02-10, **Microlensing events and primordial black holes in the axionlike curvaton model**, Kentaro Kasai et.al., [2602.09558v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09558v1)

 Recently, Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations found 12 candidates for microlensing events. These events can be explained by primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses of $10^{-7}$-$10^{-6} M\_\odot$ and a fraction of all dark matter of $f\_\mathrm{PBH} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. In this paper, we consider the PBH production in two types of the axionlike curvaton models, which predict an enhancement of the curvature perturbations on small scales. We show that the microlensing events can be explained in the axionlike curvaton model and discuss the cosmological implications such as gravitational waves.

2026-02-10, **Field-Dependent Qubit Flux Noise Simulated from Materials-Specific Disordered Exchange Interactions Between Paramagnetic Adsorbates**, Keith G. Ray et.al., [2602.09471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09471v1)

 Superconducting quantum devices, from qubits and magnetometers to dark matter detectors, are influenced by magnetic flux noise originating from paramagnetic surface defects and impurities. These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$\_2$ molecules on an Al$\_2$O$\_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise.

2026-02-10, **First Nuclear Ultra-Heavy Dark Matter Search in Argon Time Projection Chambers with the DarkSide-50 Experiment**, P. Agnes et.al., [2602.09421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09421v1)

 We report the first search for nuclear ultra-heavy dark matter (UHDM) in a dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber using the DarkSide-50 experiment. Unlike conventional weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), nuclear UHDM candidates may be composed of many dark nucleons and scatter numerous times while passing through the detector. Accounting for energy loss through the Earth's overburden, we apply selection criteria optimized for multi-scatter event topologies using the 532-day low-radiation campaign of the DarkSide-50 detector. Excluded limits on the UHDM-nucleon scattering cross section for dark nucleon masses of $m\_χ= 10, 50, 100, 500 \, \mathrm{GeV/c^2}$ are presented.

2026-02-11, **Unmasking LHAASO J2108+5157: Near Infrared Insights into a Mysterious TeV Source**, Josep Martí et.al., [2602.11148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11148v1)

 LHAASO J2108+5157 is one of the few ultra-high energy gamma-ray sources in the LHAASO catalogue without secure counterpart at longer wavelengths. Several Galactic scenarios have been proposed, including an evolved supernova remnant and a pulsar wind nebula. Yet, no shocked gas, shell-like structure, or compact pulsar candidate has been identified. Follow-up observations with VERITAS and the LST-1 prototype have not firmly clarified its nature. A recent microquasar candidate from GMRT radio data remains uncertain. Here we present the first dedicated near-infrared study of the field, combining deep JHKs imaging with narrow band observations targeting the H2 v=1-0 S(1) line. Our observations were initially planned to encompass the full source region, but now only partially cover the latest updated position and size of LHAASO J2108+5157. We find no evidence of shocked emission, extended nebular structures, or an accreting compact object signature in the covered field. The GMRT radio source, despite its jet-like morphology, exhibits near-infrared properties incompatible with both a Galactic microquasar and a nearby radio galaxy, discouraging an association with the gamma-ray emission. Our analysis reveals no convincing counterpart consistent within the positional uncertainty, leaving LHAASO J2108+5157 as an enigmatic ultra-high energy emitter that requires deeper observations.

 In this work, we attempted to apply the dipole fitting (DF) method to galaxy clusters to search for cosmic anisotropic signals, and to construct a statistical isotropic analysis scheme for them. Compared to Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia), the galaxy clusters offer a significant advantage in terms of spatial distribution. This advantage makes the anisotropic signals obtained from them more reliable. From 313 galaxy clusters (Chandra + XMM-Newton), we find two preferred directions (l, b) = (${257.82^{\circ}}\_{-52.88}^{+58.01}$, $-31.30{^{\circ}}\_{-39.46}^{+35.92}$) and ($80.89{^{\circ}}\_{-52.46}^{+60.97}$, $31.75{^{\circ}}\_{-40.16}^{+35.19}$). The former to a direction where the universe is expanding at a faster rate than the surrounding area, while the latter to a slower rate of expansion. The corresponding magnitude of anisotropy is $\|A\|$ = 5.2 $\sim$ 5.4 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$. The results of statistical isotropy analyses give $\sim$1.0$σ$ confidence level. From the reanalyses based on the subsamples including Chandra, XMM-Newton, low reshift (LR, $z < 0.10$), high redshift (HR, $z > 0.10$) datasets, we find that the observation equipment and sample redshift can affect the preferred direction, anisotropic magnitude, and statistical significance of anisotropy. The XMM-Newton dataset gives a statistical significance of 2.26$σ$ (Mock) and 2.86$σ$ (Iso) which are much higher than that from Chandra and the total datasets. The magnitude of anisotropy $\|A\|$ from HR dataset is larger than that from LR dataset. Overall, our results indicate the presence of anisotropic signals in galaxy clusters, which must be taken seriously. Further test is still needed to better understand these signals.

 H-band spectra contain very limited spectral information for stars at the most metal-poor tail ( Fe/H < -2.5) because the available Fe lines in FGK stars in this wavelength range are weak. The first paper in this series successfully identified a sample of 327 very metal-poor stars (with [Fe/H] < -2) from the APOGEE database, 289 of which are on the red giant branch. The spectra of these stars were not properly analysed by the APOGEE main pipeline because they are very metal poor. In this work, we measure metallicities for these stars using the abundances of the elements Mg and Si. We demonstrate that the absorption lines of the elements Mg and Si are of good quality despite the challenging combination of (low) metallicity, wavelength regime, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratios available for these spectra. A specialised pipeline was designed to measure the abundance of Mg and Si in APOGEE spectra and yielded a robust estimate of the overall metallicity. In order to provide reliable measurements, we tested three different sets of assumptions for Mg and Si enhancement. We present Mg and Si abundances as well as overall metallicities for 327 stars, all of which had previously gotten null values from the main APOGEE pipeline for either the calibrated M/H or [Fe/H] . The typical uncertainties for our measurements are 0.2 dex. We found five stars in our sample with unusual [Si/Mg] abundances higher than 0.5, and we connect this signature to globular cluster stars, and this might be related to specific supernova events. Our data suggest a concentration of high [Si/Mg] stars in the Sextans dwarf galaxy. Other dwarf galaxies are found to agree well with results in the literature. Our derived metallicities range between -3.1 $\leq$ [M/H] $\leq$ -2.25, thereby pushing the metal-poor tail of APOGEE results down by 0.6 dex.

 Symbiotic stars are interacting binaries consisting of a red giant and typically a white dwarf, important as potential Type Ia supernova progenitors. Despite theoretical predictions that white dwarfs in symbiotic systems should often be magnetic, direct evidence has been elusive. We report the discovery of a $682.5 \pm 7$ s periodicity in the XMM-Newton X-ray light curve that we interpret as the spin period of the WD in CH Cygni. This detection provides strong evidence for a magnetic white dwarf in CH Cygni, making it only the second WD symbiotic star with confirmed X-ray pulsations after R Aquarii. Our discovery supports the magnetic propeller model previously proposed for CH Cygni's jet activity and state transitions.

2026-02-10, **The Landscape of Unstable Mass Transfer in Interacting Binaries and Its Imprint on the Population of Luminous Red Novae**, Angela A. G. Twum et.al., [2602.10211v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10211v1)

 A common-envelope (CE) phase occurs when a star engulfs its companion and is widely considered the primary channel for producing Luminous Red Novae (LRNe). In this study, we combine binary-population synthesis with stellar-evolution calculations to systematically estimate the mass, velocity, and launching radius of ejecta produced during coalescence across a range of binary configurations. Our aim is to quantify how unstable mass-transfer dynamics in binaries at various evolutionary stages shape CE outcomes, enabling a predictive framework for modeling the LRN luminosity function. We find a bimodal distribution of plateau luminosities with significant implications for binary mass stability criteria that can be tested with forthcoming LSST observations. This bimodality emerges from differing mass-ejection outcomes during common-envelope interactions, which can lead either to stellar mergers, often accompanied by tidal disruption of the companion, or to successful envelope ejection. Although our predicted plateau luminosities and timescales broadly match existing observations, the models underpredict the number of LRNe with long-duration plateaus ($t\_p \gtrsim 100\, \text{d}$) by about a third. We propose that these long-duration events arise from highly extended progenitors whose envelopes are ejected over multiple orbits (i.e., non-impulsively), producing relatively faint, long-lived transients. By constraining ejecta properties and incorporating pre-outburst progenitor imaging, we show how our models can clarify the physical processes that drive unstable mass transfer in these events. Finally, we argue that common-envelope interactions involving white-dwarf accretors can yield exotic outcomes, including red giants containing embedded white dwarfs that resemble Thorne-Żytków objects (TŻOs), along with calcium-rich supernovae that preserve hydrogen envelopes.

2026-02-10, **A method for constructing the joint mass function of binary stars**, Amery Gration et.al., [2602.10186v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10186v1)

 The initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses in a population of newly born stars and is amongst the most fundamental concepts in astrophysics. It is not only the direct result of the star formation process but it also explains the evolution of galaxies' luminosities, metal yields, star-formation efficiencies, and supernova production rates. Because most stars exist in binary systems, however, a full statistical account of stellar mass requires not the IMF but rather the joint distribution of a binary population's primary- and secondary-star masses. This joint distribution must respect the IMF of the stars from which the population has been assembled as well as the distribution of mass ratios that results from the assembly mechanism. Despite its importance, this joint distribution is known only in the case of random pairing. Here we present a method for constructing it in the general case. We also illustrate the use of our method by recovering the known result for random pairing and by finding the previously unknown result for uniform pairing.

 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear runaways in certain white dwarfs in binary systems. They have been extensively studied, yet their progenitor and explosion mechanisms remain poorly understood. We study a large sample of SNe Ia comparing the narrow interstellar absorption features in their spectra with various photometric and spectroscopic supernova properties, as well as with environmental characteristics. We find that the sodium absorption is significantly stronger in younger, more star-forming and more centrally located SNe Ia, as expected. However, we also show that there is a strong dependence on intrinsic properties that is independent of the environment. In fact, we find strong evidence for two environmental SN Ia populations, an old and a young one, with the young population showing significantly different distributions of sodium strength when divided according to the Si II ejecta velocity, nebular velocity, extinction, E(B-V), and reddening curve, RV. Performing a clustering of the SNe Ia, we recover an old population of SNe with low extinction and normal ejecta velocity, while we confirm that the young population can be subdivided into a group of highly-extincted, high-velocity SNe Ia with much stronger blueshifted sodium absorption, and another of low-extincted, normal-velocity objects with little sodium absorption. We interpret this relation of intervening material with intrinsic properties as evidence for the young SN Ia population, occurring in young and star-forming environments, to have asymmetric radiation that interacts with nearby material, and whose observables depend thus on the viewing angle. Finally, we show that the cosmological mass-step is consistent with these populations.

 This study investigates and compares two prominent two-dimensional dark energy (DE) parameterizations: Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) and Logarithmic forms by comparing them with a comprehensive set of observational data comprising Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Pantheon compilation, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (DESI BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC). The primary objective was to explore the constraining power and cosmological implications of each parameterization in light of the current data. After formulating the theoretical framework and background equations governing cosmic expansion, we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques using the emcee Python package to constrain the free parameters of each model. The best-fit values for parameters $ω\_0$, $ω\_a$, and $H\_0$ were extracted for each model using individual and combined datasets. The results include confidence contours at the levels $1σ$ and $2σ$. Our findings demonstrate that both parameterizations are consistent with observational data, with logarithmic parameterization showing slightly better constraints in terms of parameter evolution. Furthermore, we employed a statefinder diagnostic to analyze the geometric behavior of the models, providing an effective distinction between the two DE scenarios. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of DE evolution and its constraints in light of current cosmological data.

2026-02-10, **Orbital Period Changes of Recurrent Nova T Pyxidis Demonstrate that M_ejecta >> 11.3xM_accreted and Is Not a Type Ia Supernova Progenitor**, Bradley E. Schaefer et.al., [2602.09377v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09377v1)

 Recurrent nova (RN) T Pyxidis (T Pyx) has a complex history of mass accreting-onto and ejection-from the white dwarf, with a classical nova eruption around 1866 kick-starting a RN-phase with six RN eruptions from 1890--2011. T Pyx is a primary progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). This is chiefly a question of whether the mass accreted by the white dwarf ($M\_{\rm accreted}$) is more-or-less than the mass ejected by the nova eruptions ($M\_{\rm ejecta}$) over the entire eruption cycle. Prior attempts to measure $M\_{\rm ejecta}$ from the traditional methods have a scatter of $>$130$\times$, so only a new technique can provide a measure of adequate accuracy and reliability. This new technique is the timing experiment of measuring the orbital period from 1986 to 2025, where the period increased by $+$50.3$\pm$7.9 parts-per-million across the 2011 eruption. With simple and sure physics, the best estimate for the mass ejected by one RN event is $>$2400$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$\_{\odot}$, with an extreme inviolate limit of $\gg$354$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$\_{\odot}$. Over all eruptions in a cycle, $M\_{ejecta}$$>$17120$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$\_{\odot}$, with an inviolate limit of $M\_{ejecta}$$\gg$2144$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$\_{\odot}$. Over the full eruption cycle, the white dwarf accreted 220$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$\_{\odot}$. So M$\_{\rm ejecta}$$\gg$11.3$\times$M$\_{\rm accreted}$, and T Pyx can never become a SNIa. This paper is the seventh in a series proving that each of various popular candidate SNIa progenitors cannot possibly evolve to a supernova; including V445 Pup, U Sco, T CrB, all symbiotic stars, FQ Cir, V1405 Cas, and now T Pyx.
