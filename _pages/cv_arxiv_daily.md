2023-10-26, **Soft supersymmetry breaking as the sole origin of neutrino masses and lepton number violation**, Anjan S. Joshipura et.al., [2310.17472v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17472v1)

 We discuss a scenario in which the supergravity induced soft terms, conventionally used for breaking supersymmetry, also lead to non-zero Majorana neutrino masses. The soft terms lead to the spontaneous violation of the lepton number at the gravitino mass scale $m\_{3/2}$ which in turn leads to (i) the Majorana masses of ${\cal O} (m\_{3/2})$ for the right-handed neutrinos and (ii) the $R$-parity breaking at the same scale. The former contributes to light neutrino masses through the type I seesaw mechanism, while the latter adds to it through neutrino-neutralino mixing. Both contributions can scale inversely with respect to $m\_{3/2}$ given that gaugino and Higgsino masses are also of order $m\_{3/2}$. Together, these two contributions adequately explain observed neutrino masses and mixing. One realization of the scenario also naturally leads to a $\mu$ parameter of ${\cal O} (m\_{3/2})$. Despite the lepton number symmetry breaking close to the weak scale, the Majoron in the model exhibits very weak coupling to leptons, satisfying existing constraints on Majoron-lepton interactions. The right-handed neutrinos in the model have a large coupling to Higgsinos. This coupling and the relatively large heavy-light neutrino mixing induced through the seesaw mechanism can lead to the observable signals at colliders in terms of displaced vertices.

2023-10-26, **Long-lived HNLs at lepton colliders as a probe of left-right symmetric models**, Kevin A. Urquía-Calderón et.al., [2310.17406v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17406v1)

 Left-right symmetric models (LRSM) were proposed to reconcile the apparent parity violation in weak interactions with our intrinsic notion of fundamental parity symmetry. It was quickly realized that LRSM offers a viable framework for explaining neutrino masses by incorporating right-handed neutrinos, $N$, into its spectrum. In this study, we investigate for the first time the potential of future lepton colliders (including the FCC-ee, CEPC, ILC, CLIC, and a muon collider) to detect signals stemming from $N$'s, focusing primarily on displaced vertex signals, and on prompt signals to a lesser degree. Our results demonstrate that these signals can effectively probe the characteristic scales of LRSM, providing evidence that would be unobtainable through any other experimental means.

2023-10-26, **Reconstructing the early-universe expansion and thermal history**, Rui An et.al., [2310.17195v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17195v1)

 We present a model-independent reconstruction of the early expansion and thermal histories of the universe, obtained from light element abundance measurements. The expansion history is tightly constrained around the onset of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The temperature of photons is additionally constrained around the time of neutrino decoupling. Allowing for perturbations to the standard expansion rate, we find that the radiation energy density is constrained to within 15% of its $\Lambda$CDM value, and only 1% extra matter energy density is allowed around the epoch of BBN. We introduce a new and general analytic fitting formula for the temperature variation, which is flexible enough to reproduce the signal of large classes of beyond-CDM particle models that can alter the temperature through early-time energy injection. We present its constraints from BBN data and from the measurements of effective number of relativistic species and helium-4 abundance probed by the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation anisotropy. Our results provide clarity on the most fundamental properties of the early universe, reconstructed with minimal assumptions about the unknown physics that can occur at keV--MeV energy scales and can be mapped to broad classes of models of interest to cosmology.

2023-10-26, **Novel moduli space in modular flavor models : a case study for modular $T'$ seesaw model with hidden $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry**, Keiya Ishiguro et.al., [2310.17068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17068v1)

 We study flavor phenomenologies in a basis of a double covering of modular $A\_4$ group with a hidden $SU(2)$ symmetry, in which we work on regions at nearby two fixed points and three special points. These special points of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ moduli space are statistically favored in flux compactifications of Type IIB string theory. Neutrino masses are approximately obtained by using the seesaw mechanism due to our two additional symmetries. We perform chi square numerical analysis for each of the fixed/special points in the normal and inverted hierarchies and demonstrate predictions for each case. Then, we briefly discuss the possible signature of hidden gauge bosons at collider experiments from the hidden $SU(2)$ symmetry.

2023-10-25, **Measurement of the Multi-Neutron $\barν_μ$ Charged Current Differential Cross Section at Low Available Energy on Hydrocarbon**, A. Olivier et.al., [2310.17014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17014v1)

 Neutron production in antineutrino interactions can lead to bias in energy reconstruction in neutrino oscillation experiments, but these interactions have rarely been studied. MINERvA previously studied neutron production at an average antineutrino energy of ~3 GeV in 2016 and found deficiencies in leading models. In this paper, the MINERvA 6 GeV average antineutrino energy data set is shown to have similar disagreements. A measurement of the cross section for an antineutrino to produce two or more neutrons and have low visible energy is presented as an experiment-independent way to explore neutron production modeling. This cross section disagrees with several leading models' predictions. Neutron modeling techniques from nuclear physics are used to quantify neutron detection uncertainties on this result.

2023-10-25, **Multi-messenger astronomy with black holes: tidal disruption events**, Thomas Wevers et.al., [2310.16879v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16879v1)

 This chapter provides an overview of tidal disruption events, aiming to provide an overview of both the theoretical and the observational state of the field, with the overarching goal of introducing them as tools to indirectly observe massive black holes in the Universe. We start by introducing the relevant theoretical concepts, physical scales and timescales with an emphasis on the classical framework and how this has been (and continues to be) improved since the inception of the field. We then cover the current and future prospects of observing TDEs through a variety of messengers, including photons across the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as gravitational waves and neutrino particles. More recent advancements in the field, including repeating TDEs as well as TDEs by stellar-mass black holes, are also highlighted.

2023-10-25, **Gravitational wave triggered searches for high-energy neutrinos from binary neutron star mergers: prospects for next generation detectors**, Mainak Mukhopadhyay et.al., [2310.16875v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16875v1)

 The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors - Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), will have distance horizons up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ Gpc for detecting binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. This will make them ideal for triggering high-energy neutrino searches from BNS mergers at the next generation neutrino detectors, such as IceCube-Gen2. We calculate the distance limits as a function of the time window of neutrino analysis, up to which meaningful triggers from the GW detectors can be used to minimize backgrounds and collect a good sample of high-energy neutrino events at the neutrino detectors, using the sky localization capabilities of the GW detectors. We then discuss the prospects of the next generation detectors to work in synergy to facilitate coincident neutrino detections or to constrain the parameter space in the case of non-detection of neutrinos. We show that good localization of GW events, which can be achieved by multiple third generation GW detectors, is necessary to detect a GW-associated neutrino event or put a meaningful constraint ($\sim 3\sigma$ confidence level) on neutrino emission models. Such a model independent analysis can also help constrain physical models and hence provide insights into neutrino production mechanisms in binary neutron star mergers.

2023-10-25, **Quasithermal GeV neutrinos from neutron-loaded magnetized outflows in core-collapse supernovae: spectra and light curves**, Jose Alonso Carpio et.al., [2310.16823v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16823v1)

 Rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized protoneutron stars (PNSs) created in core-collapse supernovae can drive relativistic magnetized winds. Ions and neutrons can be co-accelerated while they remain coupled through elastic collisions. We investigate the nucleosynthesis and subsequent nuclear disintegration, and find that relativistic neutrons can be generated in such magnetized winds. Upon eventual decoupling, resulting inelastic collisions with ejecta lead to pion production, resulting in $0.1-10\,{\rm GeV}$ neutrinos. Following this scenario presented in Murase, Dasgupta & Thompson, Phys. Rev. D, 89, 043012 (2014), we numerically calculate the spectra and light curves of quasithermal neutrino emission and find that power-law tails are formed without cosmic-ray acceleration. In the event of a Galactic supernova, $\sim 10-1000$ neutrino events could be detected with Hyper-Kamiokande, KM3Net-ORCA and IceCube-Upgrade for PNSs with surface magnetic field $B\_{\rm dip}\sim 10^{13-15}\,{\rm G}$ and initial spin period $P\_i \sim 1-30\,{\rm ms}$. Successful detection will enable us to study supernovae as multienergy neutrino sources and may provide clues to the roles of PNSs in diverse classes of transients.

2023-10-25, **STRAW-b (STRings for Absorption length in Water-b): the second pathfinder mission for the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment**, Kilian Holzapfel et.al., [2310.16714v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16714v2)

 Since 2018, the potential for a high-energy neutrino telescope, named the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment (P-ONE), has been thoroughly examined by two pathfinder missions, STRAW and STRAW-b, short for short for Strings for Absorption Length in Water. The P-ONE project seeks to install a neutrino detector with a one cubic kilometer volume in the Cascadia Basin's deep marine surroundings, situated near the western shores of Vancouver Island, Canada. To assess the environmental conditions and feasibility of constructing a neutrino detector of that scale, the pathfinder missions, STRAW and STRAW-b, have been deployed at a depth of 2.7 km within the designated site for P-ONE and were connected to the NEPTUNE observatory, operated by Ocean Networks Canada (ONC). While STRAW focused on analyzing the optical properties of water in the Cascadia Basin, \ac{strawb} employed cameras and spectrometers to investigate the characteristics of bioluminescence in the deep-sea environment. This report introduces the STRAW-b concept, covering its scientific objectives and the instrumentation used. Furthermore, it discusses the design considerations implemented to guarantee a secure and dependable deployment process of STRAW-b. Additionally, it showcases the data collected by battery-powered loggers, which monitored the mechanical stress on the equipment throughout the deployment. The report also offers an overview of STRAW-b's operation, with a specific emphasis on the notable advancements achieved in the data acquisition (DAQ) system and its successful integration with the server infrastructure of ONC.

2023-10-25, **Probing photon-ALP oscillations from the MAGIC observations of FSRQ QSO B1420+326**, Bhanu Prakash Pant et.al., [2310.16634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16634v1)

 At the beginning of the year 2020, MAGIC reported a very-high-energy (VHE) flaring activity from the FSRQ QSO B1420+326. It is now the fourth known most distant blazar (z=0.682) with an observed VHE gamma-ray emission. In this work, we investigate the effect of photon-axion-like particle (ALP) oscillations in the gamma-ray spectra measured by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC around the flaring state. We set 95% confidence level (C.L.) upper limit on the ALP parameters and obtain a constraint on the photon-ALP coupling constant $g\_{a\gamma} < 2\times10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for ALP masses $m\_{a} \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ eV. Assuming the hadronic origin of VHE photons, we also estimate the expected neutrino flux from this source and the contribution to diffuse neutrino flux from QSO B1420+326-like FSRQs at sub-PeV energies. Furthermore, we study the implications of photon-ALP oscillations on the counterpart $\gamma$-rays of the sub-PeV neutrinos. Finally, we investigate a viable scenario of invisible neutrino decay to ALPs on the gamma-ray spectra and diffuse $\gamma$-ray flux at sub-PeV energies. Interestingly, we find that for the choice of neutrino lifetime $\tau\_{2}/m\_{2} = 10^3$ s eV$^{-1}$, the $\gamma$-ray flux has a good observational sensitivity towards LHAASO-KM2A.

2023-10-25, **Muon-induced background in a next-generation dark matter experiment based on liquid xenon**, Viktor Pěč et.al., [2310.16586v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16586v1)

 Muon-induced neutrons can lead to potentially irreducible backgrounds in rare event search experiments. We have investigated the implication of laboratory depth on the muon-induced background in a future dark matter experiment capable of reaching the so-called neutrino floor. Our simulation study focused on a xenon-based detector with 70 tonnes of active mass, surrounded by additional veto systems plus a water shield. Two locations at the Boulby Underground Laboratory (UK) were analysed as examples: an experimental cavern in salt at a depth of 2850 m w. e. (similar to the location of the existing laboratory), and a deeper laboratory located in polyhalite rock at a depth of 3575 m w. e. Our results show that no cosmogenic background events are likely to survive standard analysis cuts for 10 years of operation at either location. The largest background component we identified comes from beta-delayed neutron emission from $^{17}$N which is produced from $^{19}$F in the fluoropolymer components of the experiment. Our results confirm that a dark matter search with sensitivity to the neutrino floor is viable (from the point of view of cosmogenic backgrounds) in underground laboratories at these levels of rock overburden. This work was conducted in 2019-21 in the context of a feasibility study to investigate the possibility of developing the Boulby Underground Laboratory to host a next-generation dark matter experiment; however, our findings are also relevant for other underground laboratories.

2023-10-25, **Quantum corrections and the minimal Yukawa sector of $SU(5)$**, Ketan M. Patel et.al., [2310.16563v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16563v1)

 It is well-known that the $SU(5)$ grand unified theory, with the standard model quarks and leptons unified in $\overline{5}$ and $10$ and the electroweak Higgs doublet residing in $5$ dimensional representations, leads to relation, $Y\_d=Y\_e^T$, between the Yukawa couplings of the down-type quarks and the charged leptons. We show that this degeneracy can be lifted in a phenomenologically viable way when quantum corrections to the tree-level matching conditions are taken into account in the presence of one or more copies of gauge singlet fermions. The 1-loop threshold corrections arising from heavy leptoquark scalar and vector bosons, already present in the minimal model, and heavy singlet fermions can lead to realistic Yukawa couplings provided their masses differ by at least two orders of magnitude. The latter can also lead to a realistic light neutrino mass spectrum through the type I seesaw mechanism if the colour partner of the Higgs stays close to the Planck scale. Most importantly, our findings demonstrate the viability of the simplest Yukawa sector when quantum corrections are considered and sizeable threshold effects are present.

2023-10-25, **The $ν_{R}$-philic scalar dark matter**, Xun-Jie Xu et.al., [2310.16346v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16346v1)

 Right-handed neutrinos ($\nu\_{R}$) offer an intriguing portal to new physics in hidden sectors where dark matter (DM) may reside. In this work, we delve into the simplest hidden sector involving only a real scalar exclusively coupled to $\nu\_{R}$, referred to as the $\nu\_{R}$-philic scalar. We investigate the viability of the $\nu\_{R}$-philic scalar to serve as a DM candidate, under the constraint that the coupling of $\nu\_{R}$ to the standard model is determined by the seesaw relation and is responsible for the observed DM abundance. By analyzing the DM decay channels and solving Boltzmann equations, we identify the viable parameter space. In particular, our study reveals a lower bound ($\sim10^{4}$ GeV) on the mass of $\nu\_{R}$ for the $\nu\_{R}$-philic scalar to be DM. The DM mass may vary from sub-keV to sub-GeV. Within the viable parameter space, monochromatic neutrino lines from DM decay can be an important signal for DM indirect detection.

2023-10-26, **Fermion Proca Stars: Vector Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars**, Cédric Jockel et.al., [2310.17291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17291v1)

 Dark matter could accumulate around neutron stars in sufficient amounts to affect their global properties. In this work, we study the effect of a specific model for dark matter -- a massive and self-interacting vector (spin-1) field -- on neutron stars. We describe the combined systems of neutron stars and vector dark matter using Einstein-Proca theory coupled to a nuclear-matter term, and find scaling relations between the field and metric components in the equations of motion. We construct equilibrium solutions of the combined systems, compute their masses and radii and also analyse their stability and higher modes. The combined systems admit dark matter (DM) core and cloud solutions. Core solutions compactify the neutron star component and tend to decrease the total mass of the combined system. Cloud solutions have the inverse effect. Electromagnetic observations of certain cloud-like configurations would appear to violate the Buchdahl limit. This could make Buchdahl-limit violating objects smoking gun signals for dark matter in neutron stars. The self-interaction strength is found to significantly affect both mass and radius. We also compare fermion Proca stars to objects where the dark matter is modelled using a complex scalar field. We find that fermion Proca stars tend to be more massive and geometrically larger than their scalar field counterparts for equal boson masses and self-interaction strengths. Both systems can produce degenerate masses and radii for different amounts of DM and DM particle masses.

2023-10-26, **Using two point correlation functions to understand the assembly histories of Milky Way-like galaxies**, Yike Zhang et.al., [2310.17104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17104v1)

 The two point correlation function (2PCF) is a powerful statistical tool to measure galaxy clustering. Although 2PCF has also been used to study the clustering of stars on parsec and sub-parsec scales, its physical implication is not clear on such non-linear scales. In this study, we use the Illustris-TNG50 simulation to study the connection between the 2PCF signals of accreted halo stars and the assembly histories of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find, in general, the 2PCF signal increases with the increase in galactocentric radii, $r$, and with the decrease in the pair separations. Galaxies which assemble late on average have stronger 2PCF signals. With $z\_{1/4}$, $z\_{1/2}$ and $z\_{3/4}$ defined as the redshifts when galaxies accreted one-fourth, half and three-fourths of their ex-situ stellar mass at today, we find all of them show the strongest correlations with the 2PCF signals at $r\sim0.2R\_{200}$. $z\_{3/4}$ shows the strongest correlations at all radii than those of $z\_{1/4}$ or $z\_{1/2}$, as later accreted stars preserve better clusterings. However, the correlations between the 2PCF signals at different radii and the galaxy formation times all have large scatters. The 2PCFs in velocity space show weaker correlations with the galaxy formation times within $0.38R\_{200}$ than real space 2PCFs, and the scatter is considerably large. Both the real and velocity space 2PCFs correlate with the assembly histories of the host dark matter halos as well. Within $0.38R\_{200}$, the real space 2PCF shows stronger correlations with the galaxy formation histories than with the halo formation histories, while the velocity space 2PCFs do not show large differences. We conclude that it is difficult to use 2PCF alone to precisely predict the formation times or assembly histories of galaxies.

2023-10-26, **Dark matter signatures of black holes with Yukawa potential**, A. A. Araújo Filho et.al., [2310.17081v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17081v1)

 This study uses a nonsingular Yukawa--modified potential to obtain a static and spherically symmetric black hole solution with a cosmological constant. Such Yukawa--like corrections are encoded in two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, that modify Newton's law of gravity in large distances, and a deformation parameter $\ell\_0$, which plays an essential role in short distances. The most significant effect is encoded in $\alpha$, which modifies the total black hole mass with an extra mass proportional to $\alpha M$, mimicking the dark matter effects at large distances from the black hole. On the other hand, the effect due to $\lambda$ is small for astrophysical values. We scrutinize the \textit{quasinormal} frequencies and shadows associated with a spherically symmetric black hole and the thermodynamical behavior influenced by the Yukawa potential. In particular, the thermodynamics of this black hole displays a rich behavior, including possible phase transitions. We use the WKB method to probe the \textit{quasinormal} modes of massless scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational field perturbations. In order to check the influence of the parameters on the shadow radius, we consider astrophysical data to determine their values, incorporating information on an optically thin radiating and infalling gas surrounding a black hole to model the black hole shadow image. In particular, we consider Sgr A* black hole as an example and we find that its shadow radius changes by order of $10^{-9}$, meaning that the shadow radius of a black hole with Yukawa potential practically gives rise to the same result encountered in the Schwarzschild black hole. Also, in the eikonal regime, using astrophysical data for Yukawa parameters, we show that the value of the real part of the QNMs frequencies changes by $10^{-18}$.

2023-10-25, **Primordial Black Holes with QCD Color Charge**, Elba Alonso-Monsalve et.al., [2310.16877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16877v1)

 We describe a realistic mechanism whereby black holes with significant QCD color charge could have formed during the early universe. Primordial black holes (PBHs) could make up a significant fraction of the dark matter if they formed well before the QCD confinement transition. Such PBHs would form by absorbing unconfined quarks and gluons, and hence could acquire a net color charge. We estimate the number of PBHs per Hubble volume with near-extremal color charge for various scenarios, and discuss possible phenomenological implications.

2023-10-26, **Does or did the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A operate as a PeVatron?**, Zhen Cao et.al., [2310.17082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17082v1)

 For decades, supernova remnants (SNRs) have been considered the prime sources of Galactic Cosmic rays (CRs). But whether SNRs can accelerate CR protons to PeV energies and thus dominate CR flux up to the knee is currently under intensive theoretical and phenomenological debate. The direct test of the ability of SNRs to operate as CR PeVatrons can be provided by ultrahigh-energy (UHE; $E\_\gamma \geq 100$~TeV) $\gamma$-rays. In this context, the historical SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is considered one of the most promising target for UHE observations. This paper presents the observation of Cas A and its vicinity by the LHAASO KM2A detector. The exceptional sensitivity of LHAASO KM2A in the UHE band, combined with the young age of Cas A, enabled us to derive stringent model-independent limits on the energy budget of UHE protons and nuclei accelerated by Cas A at any epoch after the explosion. The results challenge the prevailing paradigm that Cas A-type SNRs are major suppliers of PeV CRs in the Milky Way.

2023-10-25, **SPLUS J142445.34-254247.1: An R-Process Enhanced, Actinide-Boost, Extremely Metal-Poor star observed with GHOST**, Vinicius M. Placco et.al., [2310.17024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17024v1)

 We report on the chemo-dynamical analysis of SPLUS J142445.34-254247.1, an extremely metal-poor halo star enhanced in elements formed by the rapid neutron-capture process. This star was first selected as a metal-poor candidate from its narrow-band S-PLUS photometry and followed up spectroscopically in medium-resolution with Gemini South/GMOS, which confirmed its low-metallicity status. High-resolution spectroscopy was gathered with GHOST at Gemini South, allowing for the determination of chemical abundances for 36 elements, from carbon to thorium. At [Fe/H]=-3.39, SPLUS J1424-2542 is one of the lowest metallicity stars with measured Th and has the highest logeps(Th/Eu) observed to date, making it part of the "actinide-boost" category of r-process enhanced stars. The analysis presented here suggests that the gas cloud from which SPLUS J1424-2542 was formed must have been enriched by at least two progenitor populations. The light-element (Z<=30) abundance pattern is consistent with the yields from a supernova explosion of metal-free stars with 11.3-13.4 Msun, and the heavy-element (Z>=38) abundance pattern can be reproduced by the yields from a neutron star merger (1.66Msun and 1.27Msun) event. A kinematical analysis also reveals that SPLUS J1424-2542 is a low-mass, old halo star with a likely in-situ origin, not associated with any known early merger events in the Milky Way.

2023-10-25, **SPICE: the connection between cosmic reionisation and stellar feedback in the first galaxies**, Aniket Bhagwat et.al., [2310.16895v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16895v1)

 We present SPICE, a new suite of RHD cosmological simulations targeting the epoch of reionisation. The goal of these simulations is to systematically probe a variety of stellar feedback models, including "bursty" and "smooth" forms of supernova energy injection, as well as poorly-explored scenarios such as hypernova explosions and radiation pressure. Subtle differences in the behaviour of supernova feedback drive profound differences in reionisation histories, with burstier forms of feedback causing earlier reionisation. We also find that some global galaxy properties, such as the dust-attenuated luminosity functions and star formation main sequence, remain degenerate between models. Stellar feedback and its strength determine the morphological mix of galaxies emerging by z = 5 and that the reionisation history is inextricably connected to intrinsic properties such as galaxy kinematics and morphology. While star-forming, massive disks are prevalent if supernova feedback is "smooth", "bursty" feedback preferentially generates dispersion-dominated systems. Different modes of feedback produce different strengths of outflows, altering the ISM/CGM in different ways, and in turn strongly affecting the escape of LyC photons. We establish a correlation between galaxy morphology and LyC escape fraction, revealing that dispersion-dominated systems have escape fractions 10-50 times higher than their rotation-dominated counterparts at all redshifts. Dispersion-dominated systems should thus preferentially generate large HII regions as compared to their rotation-dominated counterparts. Since dispersion-dominated systems are more prevalent if stellar feedback is more explosive, reionisation occurs earlier in our simulation with burstier feedback. Statistical samples of post-reionisation galaxy morphologies probed with JWST, ALMA and MUSE can constrain stellar feedback and models of cosmic reionisation.

2023-10-25, **Detecting Detached Black Hole binaries through Photometric Variability**, Chirag Chawla et.al., [2310.16891v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16891v1)

 Understanding the connection between the properties of black holes (BHs) and their progenitors is interesting in many branches of astrophysics. Discovering BHs in detached orbits with luminous companions (LCs) promises to help create this map since the LC and BH progenitor are expected to have the same metallicity and formation time. We explore the possibility of detecting BH-LC binaries in detached orbits using photometric variations of the LC flux, induced by tidal ellipsoidal variation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. We create realistic present-day populations of detached BH-LC binaries in the Milky Way (MW) using binary population synthesis where we adopt observationally motivated initial stellar and binary properties, star formation history and present-day distribution of these sources in the MW based on detailed cosmological simulations. We test detectability of these sources via photometric variability by Gaia and TESS missions by incorporating their respective detailed detection biases as well as interstellar extinction. We find that Gaia (TESS) is expected to resolve ~700-1500 (~100-400) detached BH-LC binaries depending on the photometric precision and details of supernova physics. We find that ~369 BH-LC binaries would be common both in Gaia and TESS. Moreover, between ~80-270 (~70-290) of these BH-LC binaries can be further characterised using Gaia's radial velocity (astrometry) measurements.

2023-10-25, **The Early Ultraviolet Light-Curves of Type II Supernovae and the Radii of Their Progenitor Stars**, Ido Irani et.al., [2310.16885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16885v1)

 We present a sample of 34 normal SNe II detected with the Zwicky Transient Facility, with multi-band UV light-curves starting at $t \leq 4$ days after explosion, as well as X-ray detections and upper limits. We characterize the early UV-optical colors and provide prescriptions for empirical host-extinction corrections. We show that the $t > 2\,$days UV-optical colors and the blackbody evolution of the sample are consistent with the predictions of spherical phase shock-cooling (SC), independently of the presence of `flash ionization" features. We present a framework for fitting SC models which can reproduce the parameters of a set of multi-group simulations without a significant bias up to 20% in radius and velocity. Observations of about half of the SNe II in the sample are well-fit by models with breakout radii $<10^{14}\,$cm. The other half are typically more luminous, with observations from day 1 onward that are better fit by a model with a large $>10^{14}\,$cm breakout radius. However, these fits predict an early rise during the first day that is too slow. We suggest these large-breakout events are explosions of stars with an inflated envelope or a confined CSM with a steep density profile, at which breakout occurs. Using the X-ray data, we derive constraints on the extended ($\sim10^{15}$ cm) CSM density independent of spectral modeling, and find most SNe II progenitors lose $<10^{-4} M\_{\odot}\, \rm yr^{-1}$ a few years before explosion. This provides independent evidence the CSM around many SNe II progenitors is confined. We show that the overall observed breakout radius distribution is skewed to higher radii due to a luminosity bias. We argue that the $66^{+11}\_{-22}\%$ of red supergiants (RSG) explode as SNe II with breakout radii consistent with the observed distribution of field RSG, with a tail extending to large radii, likely due to the presence of CSM.

 We consider the finite velocity of the ejecta of a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in the double detonation (DDet) scenario with a white dwarf (WD) mass-donor companion, and find that the runaway velocity of the surviving (mass donor) WD is lower than its pre-explosion orbital velocity by about 8-11 %. This implies that the fastest runaway WDs in the Galaxy, if come from the DDet scenario, require even more massive WDs than what a simple calculation that neglects the finite ejecta velocity gives. This extreme set of initial conditions makes such binaries less common. We also tentatively find that the inner ejecta largely deviate from spherical symmetry, unlike observed SN Ia remnants. We argue that these findings support the claim that the DDet scenario leads mostly to peculiar SNe Ia but not to normal SNe Ia.

 We present new and archival Australia Telescope Compact Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of the Small Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219 at 2100, 5500, 9000, and 108000 MHz; as well as Hi data provided by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. The remnant shows a ring-like morphology with a mean radius of 6.2 pc. The 5500 MHz image reveals a bridge-like structure, seen for the first time in a radio image. This structure is also visible in both optical and X-ray images. In the 9000 MHz image we detect a central feature that has a flux density of 4.3 mJy but rule out a pulsar wind nebula origin, due to the lack of significant polarisation towards the central feature with an upper limit of 4 per cent. The mean fractional polarisation for 1E 0102.2-7219 is 7 +- 1 and 12 +- 2 per cent for 5500 and 9000 MHz, respectively. The spectral index for the entire remnant is -0.61 +- 0.01. We estimate the line-of-sight magnetic field strength in the direction of 1E 0102.2-7219 of ~44 microG with an equipartition field of 65 +- 5 microG. This latter model, uses the minimum energy of the sum of the magnetic field and cosmic ray electrons only. We detect an Hi cloud towards this remnant at the velocity range of ~160-180 km s-1 and a cavity-like structure at the velocity of 163.7-167.6 km s-1. We do not detect CO emission towards 1E 0102.2-7219.

2023-10-25, **Joint Constraints on the Hubble Constant, Spatial Curvature, and Sound Horizon from the Late-time Universe with Cosmography**, Kaituo Zhang et.al., [2310.16512v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16512v1)

 In this paper, using the latest Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and observational Hubble data (OHD), we carry out a joint constraint on the Hubble constant $H\_0$, the spatial curvature $\Omega\_{\rm K}$, and the sound horizon at the end of drag epoch $r\_{\rm d}$. To be model-independent, four cosmography models, i.e., the Taylor series in terms of redshift $y\_1=z/(1+z)$, $y\_2=\arctan(z)$, $y\_3=\ln(1+z)$, and the Pad\'e approximants, are used without the assumption of flat Universe. The results show that the $H\_0$ is anti-correlated with $\Omega\_{\rm K}$ and $r\_{\rm d}$, indicating smaller $\Omega\_{\rm K}$ or $r\_{\rm d}$ would be helpful in alleviating the Hubble tension. And the values of $H\_0$ and $r\_{\rm d}$ are consistent with the estimate derived from the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data based on the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, but $H\_0$ is in 2.3$\sim$3.0$\sigma$ tension with that obtained by \cite{Riess2022} in all these cosmographic approaches. Meanwhile, a flat Universe is preferred by the present observations under all approximations except the third order of $y\_1$ and $y\_2$ of the Taylor series. Furthermore, according to the values of the Bayesian evidence, we found that the flat $\Lambda$CDM remains to be the most favored model by the joint datasets, and the Pad\'e approximant of order (2,2), the third order of $y\_3$ and $y\_1$ are the top three cosmographic expansions that fit the datasets best, while the Taylor series in terms of $y\_2$ are essentially ruled out.

2023-10-25, **The effects of Thomson scattering and chemical mixing on early-time light curves of double peaked type IIb supernovae**, Seong Hyun Park et.al., [2310.16328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16328v1)

 Previous numerical simulations of double-peaked SNe IIb light curves have demonstrated that the radius and mass of the hydrogen-rich envelope of the progenitor star can significantly influence the brightness and timescale of the early-time light curve around the first peak. In this study, we investigate how Thomson scattering and chemical mixing in the SN ejecta affect the optical light curves during the early stages of the SNe IIb using radiation hydrodynamics simulations. By comparing the results from two different numerical codes (i.e., \stella{} and \snec{}), we find that the optical brightness of the first peak can be reduced by more than a factor of 3 due to the effect of Thomson scattering that causes the thermalization depth to be located below the Rosseland-mean photosphere, compared to the corresponding case where this effect is ignored. We also observe a short-lived plateau-like feature lasting for a few days in the early-time optical light curves of our models, in contrast to typical observed SNe IIb that show a quasi-linear decrease in optical magnitudes after the first peak. A significant degree of chemical mixing between the hydrogen-rich envelope and the helium core in SN ejecta is required to reconcile this discrepancy between the model prediction and observation. Meanwhile, to properly reproduce the first peak, a significant mixing of \nifs{} into the hydrogen-rich outermost layers should be restricted. Our findings indicate that inferring the SN IIb progenitor structure from a simplified approach that ignores these two factors may introduce substantial uncertainty.
