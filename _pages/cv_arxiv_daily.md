2023-10-04, **A lepton model with nearly Cobimaximal mixing**, Juan Carlos GÃ³mez-Izquierdo et.al., [2310.03000v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03000v1)

 Cobimaximal mixing predicts $\pi/4$ and $3\pi/2$ for the atmospheric angle and the Dirac CP-violating phase, respectively. These values are in tension with the neutrino globals fits. If this pattern was behind the lepton mixings, then it would have to be broken. In that case, in this paper, we explore the $\mathbf{S}\_{3}$ flavor symmetry within the $B-L$ gauge model where the aforementioned scheme comes from the neutrino sector but the charged lepton contribution breaks the well known predictions so the mixing observables as well as the $m\_{ee}$ mass can be accommodated quite well according to the available data. Notably, the predicted regions for the Dirac CP-violating phase would allow to test the model in future experiments.

2023-10-04, **Evolutionary tracks of massive stars with different rotation and metallicity in neutrino H-R diagram**, Hao Wang et.al., [2310.02824v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02824v1)

 Neutrino losses play a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars. We study the neutrino luminosity of stars ranging from 20 to 90 M\_{\odot} from Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) to Fe Core Collapse (FeCC) with different rotation and metallicity in a neutrino Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In our simulations, we consider {\omega}/{\omega}crit = 0 and 0.7 to represent non-rotation and high rotation, respectively, and set the metallicities to 0.014, 0.001, and 0.0001. During hydrogen burning stages, neutrino luminosity primarily originates from CNO cycle, and increases with higher stellar mass while decreasing with increasing metallicity. For the high metallicity models (Z = 0.014) during the helium burning stage, the reduction of the hydrogen envelope caused by a larger mass loss rate leads to a gradual decrease in neutrino luminosity. The rapid rotation results in extra mixing inside massive stars, which increases the neutrino luminosity during main sequence (MS), while decreases the neutrino luminosity during helium burning phase. Simultaneously, the rapid rotation also increases CO core mass, which enhances the neutrino luminosity during C and O burning phase. We also investigate the effect of neutrino magnetic moment (NMM) on the massive stars. We find that the energy loss caused by the NMM does not have effects on the evolutionary destiny of massive stars, and it does not significant change the compactness at the time of Fe core collapse.

2023-10-04, **Possible explanation of not observing ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos**, Jakub Rembielinski et.al., [2310.02763v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02763v1)

 Assuming that neutrinos are spacelike (tachyonic) fermions, we calculate width for the kinematically allowed, lepton number conserving, three-body decay $\nu\_{\alpha}\rightarrow \nu\_{\alpha} \; \nu\_{\beta} \bar{\nu}\_{\beta}$ in the Standard Model. Decays of tachyonic neutrinos over cosmological distances can lead to a reduction of the neutrino flux in the high-energy end of the spectrum. We estimate upper limits on the spacelike neutrino mass based on the PeV-energy cosmological neutrino events observed in the IceCube experiment. These limits are close to those deduced from the measurements of $m\_{\nu}^2$ in the tritium-decay experiment KATRIN.

2023-10-03, **Predictions from scoto-seesaw with $A_4$ modular symmetry**, Ranjeet Kumar et.al., [2310.02363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02363v1)

 This paper's novelty lies in introducing a hybrid scoto-seesaw model rooted in $A\_4$ discrete modular symmetry leading to several interesting phenomenological implications. The scoto-seesaw framework leads to generation of one mass square difference $( \Delta m^2\_{\rm atm}$) using the type-I seesaw mechanism at the tree level. Additionally, the scotogenic contribution is vital in obtaining the other mass square difference ($\Delta m^2 \_{\rm sol}$) at the loop level, thus providing a clear interpretation of the two different mass square differences. The non-trivial transformation of Yukawa couplings under the $A\_4$ modular symmetry helps to explore neutrino phenomenology with a specific flavor structure of the mass matrix. In addition to predictions for neutrino mass ordering, mixing angles and CP phases, this setup leads to precise predictions for $\sum m\_i$ as well as $\|m\_{ee}\|$. In particular, the model predicts $\sum m\_i \in (0.073,0.097)$ eV and $\left\| m\_{ee}\right\| \in (3.15,6.66)\times 10^{-3} $ eV range; within reach of upcoming experiments. Furthermore, our model is also promising for addressing lepton flavor violations, i.e., $\ell\_\alpha \to \ell\_\beta \gamma$, $\ell\_\alpha \to 3\ell\_\beta$ and $\mu - e $ conversion rates while staying within the realm of current experimental limits.

2023-10-03, **Low-Energy Compton Scattering in Materials**, Rouven Essig et.al., [2310.02316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02316v1)

 Low-energy Compton scattering is an important background for sub-GeV dark matter direct-detection and other experiments. Current Compton scattering calculations typically rely on assumptions that are not valid in the low-energy region of interest, beneath ~ 50 eV. Here we relate the low-energy Compton scattering differential cross section to the dielectric response of the material. Our new approach can be used for a wide range of materials and includes all-electron, band structure, and collective effects, which can be particularly relevant at low energies. We demonstrate the strength of our approach in several solid-state systems, in particular Si, Ge, GaAs, and SiC, which are relevant for current and proposed experiments searching for dark matter, neutrinos, and millicharged particles.

2023-10-03, **Neutrino Emissions of TXS 0506+056 caused by a Supermassive Binary Black Hole Inspiral?**, Ilja Jaroschewski et.al., [2310.02212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02212v1)

 The IceCube neutrino observatory detected two distinct flares of high-energy neutrinos from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056: a $\sim 300$ TeV single neutrino on September 22, 2017 and a $3.5\sigma$ signature of a dozen TeV neutrinos in 2014/2015. In a previous work, it was shown that these two episodes of neutrino emission could be due to an inspiral of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) close to its merger at the core of TXS 0506+056. Such an inspiral can lead to quasi-periodic particle emission due to jet precession close to the final coalescence. This model made predictions on when the next neutrino emission episode must occur. On September 18, 2022, IceCube detected an additional, $\sim 170$ TeV neutrino in directional coincidence with the blazar TXS 0506+056, being consistent with the model prediction. Additionally, in April 2021, the Baikal Collaboration reported the detection of a $224\pm 75$ TeV neutrino, with TXS 0506+056 being in the uncertainty range of the event direction. We show that these four distinct flares of neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 are consistent with a precessing jet scenario, driven by an inspiraling SMBBH. Using improved modeling, we are now able to constrain the total mass together with the mass ratio for the binary. We predict when the next neutrino flares from TXS 0506+056 should be happening. Finally, we estimate the detection potential of the Laser-interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) for the merger in the future.

2023-10-03, **Real-time Signal Detection for Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy Measurements using Antenna Arrays**, A. Ashtari Esfahani et.al., [2310.02112v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02112v1)

 Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES) is a technique for precision measurement of the energies of charged particles, which is being developed by the Project 8 Collaboration to measure the neutrino mass using tritium beta-decay spectroscopy. Project 8 seeks to use the CRES technique to measure the neutrino mass with a sensitivity of 40~meV, requiring a large supply of tritium atoms stored in a multi-cubic meter detector volume. Antenna arrays are one potential technology compatible with an experiment of this scale, but the capability of an antenna-based CRES experiment to measure the neutrino mass depends on the efficiency of the signal detection algorithms. In this paper, we develop efficiency models for three signal detection algorithms and compare them using simulations from a prototype antenna-based CRES experiment as a case-study. The algorithms include a power threshold, a matched filter template bank, and a neural network based machine learning approach, which are analyzed in terms of their average detection efficiency and relative computational cost. It is found that significant improvements in detection efficiency and, therefore, neutrino mass sensitivity are achievable, with only a moderate increase in computation cost, by utilizing either the matched filter or machine learning approach in place of a power threshold, which is the baseline signal detection algorithm used in previous CRES experiments by Project 8.

2023-10-03, **Fermilab Main Injector and Recycler Operations in the Megawatt Era**, A. P. Schreckenberger et.al., [2310.02085v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02085v1)

 Significant upgrades to Fermilab's accelerator complex have accompanied the development of LBNF (the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility) and DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment). These improvements will facilitate 1-MW operation of the NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam for the first time this year through changes to the Recycler slip-stacking procedure and shortening of the Main Injector ramp time. The modifications to the Recycler slip-stacking and efforts to reduce the duration of the Main Injector ramp will be discussed. Additionally, details regarding further shortening of the ramp time and the subsequent impacts on future accelerator operations are presented.

2023-10-03, **Nuclear models for inclusive lepton-nucleus scattering in the quasi-elastic region and beyond**, Valerio Belocchi et.al., [2310.02007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02007v1)

 High-precision measurements in neutrino oscillation experiments require a very accurate description of the lepton-nucleus scattering process. Several cross-section calculations are available, but important discrepancies are still present between different model predictions. For the quasi-elastic channel, dominated by one particle-one hole excitations, an overview over several nuclear models - specifically Relativistic Fermi Gas, SuperScaling Approach, Spectral Function, Hartree-Fock and Random Phase Approximation - is presented and compared with data for electron-nucleus scattering, a very important process for testing theoretical models validity, highlighting the specific features of each approach. Furthermore an ongoing microscopic calculation of the two particle-two hole excitations contribution to the electromagnetic response is presented, and some preliminary results are shown.

2023-10-03, **Quantum algorithm for the Vlasov simulation of the large-scale structure formation with massive neutrinos**, Koichi Miyamoto et.al., [2310.01832v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01832v1)

 It is now experimentally established that neutrino has finite mass, and investigating its cosmological implication is of significant importance also for fundamental physics. In particular, as a matter component, massive neutrino affects the formation of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe, and conversely, observations of the LSS can give constraints on the neutrino mass. Performing large numerical simulations of the LSS formation including massive neutrino along with conventional cold dark matter is thus an important task. For this, calculating the neutrino distribution in the phase space by solving the Vlasov equation is a more suitable approach than conventional $N$-body simulations, but it requires solving the PDE in the $(6+1)$-dimensional space and is thus computationally demanding: configuring $n\_\mathrm{gr}$ grid points in each coordinate and $n\_t$ time grid points leads to $O(n\_tn\_\mathrm{gr}^6)$ complexity. We propose an efficient quantum algorithm for this task. Linearizing the Vlasov equation by neglecting the relatively weak self-gravity of the neutrino, we perform the Hamiltonian simulation to produce quantum states that encode the phase space distribution of neutrino. We also propose a way to extract the power spectrum of the neutrino density perturbations as classical data from the quantum state by quantum amplitude estimation with accuracy $\epsilon$ and query complexity of order $\widetilde{O}((n\_\mathrm{gr} + n\_t)/\epsilon)$. As far as we know, this is the first quantum algorithm for the LSS simulation that outputs the quantity of practical interest with guaranteed accuracy.

2023-10-03, **Statistical Issues on the Neutrino Mass Hierarchy with $ÎÏ^{2}$**, Fatma Sawy et.al., [2310.01814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01814v1)

 The Neutrino Mass Hierarchy Determination ($\nu$ MHD) is one of the main goals of the major current and future neutrino experiments. The statistical analysis usually proceeds from a standard method, a single dimensional estimator $(1D-\Delta \chi^{2})$ that shows some draw-backs and concerns, together with a debatable strategy. The draw-backs and considerations of the standard method will be explianed through the following three main issues. First issue is the limited power of the standard method. The $\Delta \chi^{2}$ estimator provides us with different results when different simulation procedures were used. Second issue, when $\chi^{2}\_{min(NH)}$ and $\chi^{2}\_{min(IH)}$ are drawn in a $2D$ map, their strong positive correlation manifests $\chi^{2}$ as a bi-dimensional instead of single dimensional estimator. The overlapping between the $\chi^{2}$ distributions of the two hypotheses leads to the experiment sensitivity reduction. Third issue is the robustness of the standard method. When the JUNO sensitivity is obtained using different procedures, $\Delta \chi^{2}$ as one dimensional and $\chi^{2}$ as two dimensional estimator, the experimental sensitivity varies with the different values of the atmospheric mass, the input parameter. We computed the oscillation of $\vert\overline{\Delta \chi^{2}} \vert$ with the input parameter values, $\vert\Delta m^{2} \vert\_{input}$. The MH significance using the standard method, $\Delta\chi^{2}$, strongly depends on the values of the parameter $\vert\Delta m^{2} \vert\_{input}$. Consequently, the experiment sensitivity depends on the precision of the atmospheric mass. This evaluation of the standard method confirms the draw-backs.

2023-10-04, **Total and dark mass from observations of galaxy centers with Machine Learning**, Sirui Wu et.al., [2310.02816v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02816v1)

 The galaxy total mass inside the effective radius encode important information on the dark matter and galaxy evolution model. Total "central" masses can be inferred via galaxy dynamics or with gravitational lensing, but these methods have limitations. We propose a novel approach, based on Random Forest, to make predictions on the total and dark matter content of galaxies using simple observables from imaging and spectroscopic surveys. We use catalogs of multi-band photometry, sizes, stellar mass, kinematic "measurements" (features) and dark matter (targets) of simulated galaxies, from Illustris-TNG100 hydrodynamical simulation, to train a Mass Estimate machine Learning Algorithm (Mela). We separate the simulated sample in passive early-type galaxies (ETGs), both "normal" and "dwarf", and active late-type galaxies (LTGs) and show that the mass estimator can accurately predict the galaxy dark masses inside the effective radius in all samples. We finally test the mass estimator against the central mass estimates of a series of low redshift (z$\leq$0.1) datasets, including SPIDER, MaNGA/DynPop and SAMI dwarf galaxies, derived with standard dynamical methods based on Jeans equations. Dynamical masses are reproduced within 0.30 dex ($\sim2\sigma$), with a limited fraction of outliers and almost no bias. This is independent of the sophistication of the kinematical data collected (fiber vs. 3D spectroscopy) and the dynamical analysis adopted (radial vs. axisymmetric Jeans equations, virial theorem). This makes Mela a powerful alternative to predict the mass of galaxies of massive stage-IV surveys' datasets.

2023-10-04, **Transonic galactic wind model including stellar feedbacks and application to outflows in high/low-$z$ galaxies**, Asuka Igarashi et.al., [2310.02780v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02780v1)

 Galactic winds play a crucial role in the ejection of the interstellar medium (ISM) into intergalactic space. This study presents a model that classifies possible transonic solutions of galactic winds in the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo and stellar component under spherically symmetric and steady assumptions. Our model includes injections of mass and energy resulting from supernovae feedback along a flow line. The mass flux in galactic winds is a critical factor in determining the acceleration process of the flow and revealing the impact of galactic winds on galaxy evolution. We apply the transonic galactic wind model to the observed outflow velocities of star-forming galaxies to estimate the mass flux. Dividing the mass flux by the star formation rate (SFR) yields the mass loading rate (and mass loading factor), which indicates the entrainment effect of the ISM by the hot gas flow. Our results demonstrate that the mass loading rate is inversely correlated with galaxy mass and SFR. In less massive galaxies (stellar mass $\sim 10^{7-8} M\_\odot$), the mass loading rate exceeds unity, indicating effective ejection of the ISM into intergalactic space. However, in massive galaxies (stellar mass $\sim 10^{10-11} M\_\odot$), the mass loading rate falls below unity, meaning that the mass flux cannot exceed the injected mass by supernovae, thus resulting in the ineffective ejection of the ISM.

2023-10-04, **Effect of low-mass galaxy interactions on their star formation**, Smitha Subramanian et.al., [2310.02595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02595v1)

 According to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model of galaxy formation, the hierarchical assembly process is scale-free and interactions between galaxies in all mass ranges are expected. The effects of interactions between dwarf galaxies on their evolution are not well understood. In this study, we aim to understand the effect of low-mass galaxy interactions on their star formation rate (SFR). We estimated the SFR of 22 interacting and 36 single gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the Lynx-Cancer void region using their far-ultraviolet (FUV) images from the GALEX mission. We find an enhancement in SFR by a factor of 3.4$\pm$1.2 for interacting systems compared to single dwarf galaxies in the stellar mass range of 10$^{7}$ - 10$^{8}$ M$\odot$. Our results indicate that dwarf - dwarf galaxy interactions can lead to an enhancement in their SFR. These observations are similar to the predictions based on the simulations of dwarf galaxies at lower redshifts. Future deeper and higher-spatial-resolution UV studies will help us to understand the effect of dwarf galaxy interactions on the spatial distribution of star forming clumps and to identify star formation in tidal tails.

2023-10-03, **Light QCD Axion Dark Matter from Double Level Crossings**, Hai-Jun Li et.al., [2310.02126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02126v1)

 The even light QCD axion called the $Z\_{\mathcal N}$ axion can both solve the strong CP problem and account for the dark matter (DM). We point out that the double level crossings can naturally take place in the mass mixing between the $Z\_{\mathcal N}$ axion and axionlike particle (ALP). The first level crossing occurs much earlier than the QCD phase transition, while the second level crossing occurs exactly during the QCD phase transition if it exists. The $Z\_{\mathcal N}$ axion DM relic density can be suppressed or enhanced in the single level crossing, and suppressed in the double level crossings, depending on the onset of axion oscillations. The future axion experiments can detect these level crossing effects.

2023-10-03, **Updated bounds on Axion-Like Particle Dark Matter with the optical MUSE-Faint survey**, Elisa Todarello et.al., [2310.01996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01996v1)

 Bounds are derived on the axion-like particle (ALP) to two-photon coupling in the mass range $2.65-5.27$ eV. The bounds are obtained by searching for the signal from ALP decay in the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of five dwarf spheroidal galaxies, under the assumption that ALPs constitute the dark matter component of the haloes. These bounds are of the same order and improve on the robustness of those of Reference~\cite{Regis}, and currently represent the strongest bounds within the considered mass range.

2023-10-03, **Dark Matter Search with Cherenkov Telescope Array**, Nagisa Hiroshima et.al., [2310.01847v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01847v1)

 Many models of dark matter (DM) are now widely considered and probed intensively with accelerators, underground detectors, and astrophysical experiments. Among the various approaches, high-energy astrophysical observations are extremely useful to complement laboratory searches for some DM candidates. In the near future, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) should enable us to access much heavier weakly interacting massive particles, as well as a broad range of other DM candidates. In this talk, we describe DM searches with CTA.

2023-10-03, **A Strategy for Identifying Periodic Sources Contributing to the Galactic Center Excess**, Eric J. Baxter et.al., [2310.01724v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01724v1)

 The origin of the Galactic Center gamma-ray excess has not been conclusively determined after over a decade of careful study. The two most widely discussed possibilities are a population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and annihilation of dark matter particles. In contrast with annihilating dark matter, MSPs are expected to produce periodic emission. We show that even though the number of photons contributing to the excess is small, there is potentially sufficient information in the data from Fermi to detect a periodic MSP signal. Such a detection would definitively prove that at least some fraction of the excess is due to MSPs. We argue that this conclusion is robust to potential timing perturbations of the gamma-ray photons, such as those due to Earth's orbit, even if the number of parameters that must be used to model the perturbations is $\sim 7$.

2023-10-04, **Rainbow: a colorful approach on multi-passband light curve estimation**, E. Russeil et.al., [2310.02916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02916v1)

 We present Rainbow, a physically motivated framework which enables simultaneous multi-band light curve fitting. It allows the user to construct a 2-dimensional continuous surface across wavelength and time, even in situations where the number of observations in each filter is significantly limited. Assuming the electromagnetic radiation emission from the transient can be approximated by a black-body, we combined an expected temperature evolution and a parametric function describing its bolometric light curve. These three ingredients allow the information available in one passband to guide the reconstruction in the others, thus enabling a proper use of multi-survey data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to simulated data from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) as well as real data from the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE DR1).We evaluate the quality of the estimated light curves according to three different tests: goodness of fit, time of peak prediction and ability to transfer information to machine learning (ML) based classifiers. Results confirm that Rainbow leads to equivalent (SNII) or up to 75% better (SN Ibc) goodness of fit when compared to the Monochromatic approach. Similarly, accuracy when using Rainbow best-fit values as a parameter space in multi-class ML classification improves for all classes in our sample. An efficient implementation of Rainbow has been publicly released as part of the light curve package at https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve. Our approach enables straight forward light curve estimation for objects with observations in multiple filters and from multiple experiments. It is particularly well suited for situations where light curve sampling is sparse.

2023-10-04, **Prospects for a survey of the Galactic plane with the Cherenkov Telescope Array**, CTA Consortium et.al., [2310.02828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02828v1)

 Approximately one hundred sources of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays are known in the Milky Way. A survey of the entire Galactic Plane in the energy range from a few tens of GeV to a few hundred TeV has been proposed as a Key Science Project for the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). This article presents the status of the studies towards the Galactic Plane Survey (GPS). We build and make publicly available a sky model that combines data from observations of known gamma-ray emitters with state-of-the-art physically-driven models of synthetic populations of the main classes of established Galactic VHE sources, as well as of interstellar emission from cosmic-ray interactions in the Milky Way. We also perform an optimisation of the observation strategy. We use the improved sky model and observation strategy to simulate GPS data that are analysed using the methods and software tools under development for real data. We show that the GPS has the potential to increase the number of known Galactic VHE emitters by almost a factor of five. This corresponds to the detection of more than two hundred pulsar wind nebulae and a few tens of supernova remnants at average integral fluxes one order of magnitude lower than in the existing sample above 1 TeV, therefore opening the possibility to perform unprecedented population studies. The GPS also has the potential to provide new VHE detections of binary systems and pulsars, and to identify any bright PeVatrons. Furthermore, the GPS will constitute a pathfinder for deeper follow-up observations of these source classes. Finally, we show that we can extract from GPS data an estimate of the contribution to diffuse emission from unresolved sources, and that there are good prospects of detecting interstellar emission and statistically distinguishing different scenarios.

2023-10-04, **New Dynamical Channel: Wide Binaries in the Galactic Center as a Source of Binary Interactions**, Erez Michaely et.al., [2310.02558v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02558v1)

 The inner $500\rm pc$ in the galactic center is dense with stars and a dynamically hot environment. Here, we focus on wide binaries as a source of tidally or collisional interactions. These binaries were previously ignored as sources of binary interaction because they are too wide to have a close pericenter passage, or they will quickly become unbound (ionized) due to gravitational interactions with passing neighbors. However, we show that wide binaries tend to interact more frequently with neighboring stars due to their larger cross-section for gravitational impulse interactions. These interactions mainly torque the wide system, causing it to change its eccentricity. As a result, the eccentricity might be excited to sufficiently high values, causing the binary to interact at the pericenter. As a proof of concept, we present four channels of such interactions: binary main-sequence (MS), white-dwarf (WD) - MS, black hole - MS, and lastly, WD-WD. During Galaxy's lifetime, we predict tens of thousands of MS-MS interacting binaries that may form G2-like objects later appear younger than their environment. X-ray signatures and, perhaps, supernovae may result from thousands of WD-MS and WD-WD interacting binaries from this channel. Lastly, we predict a few hundred BH-MS interacting binaries at the inner $500$~pc.

2023-10-03, **Pre-supernova outbursts by core magnetic activity**, Tamar Cohen et.al., [2310.02411v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02411v1)

 We conduct one-dimensional stellar evolutionary numerical simulations under the assumption that an efficient dynamo operates in the core of massive stars years to months before core collapse, and find that the magnetic activity enhances mass loss rate and might trigger binary interaction that leads to outbursts. We assume that the magnetic flux tubes that the dynamo forms in the inner core buoy out to the outer core where there is a steep entropy rise and a molecular weight drop. There the magnetic fields turn to thermal energy, i.e., by reconnection. We simulate this energy deposition where the entropy steeply rises and find that for our simulated cases the envelope radius increases by a factor of ~1.2-2 and luminosity by about an order of magnitude. These changes enhance mass loss rate. The envelope expansion can trigger a binary interaction that power an outburst. Because magnetic field amplification depends positively on the core rotation rate and operates in cycles, not in all cases the magnetic activity will be powerful enough to change envelope properties. Namely, only a fraction of core collapse supernovae experience pre-explosion outbursts.

2023-10-03, **Addressing type Ia supernova color variability with a linear spectral template**, CÃ¡ssia S. Nascimento et.al., [2310.02329v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02329v1)

 We investigate the potential of a pure linear expansion for the rest-frame flux of a type Ia supernova light curve fitter based on the well known Spectral Adaptive Light Curve Template 2 (SALT2). We generate the expansion components by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA) onto a representative training set. Then, we derive a Tripp-like expression for the distance modulus and fit the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model on the Pantheon sample. The constraining power of the model, dubbed Pure Expansion Template for Supernovae (PETS), and SALT2 is evaluated and we found compatible results for $\Omega\_{m0}$ and $\Omega\_{\Lambda 0}$ within $68\%$ uncertainty between the two models, with PETS' fit parameters exhibiting non negligible linear correlations with SALT2' parameters. We find non negligible correlations between PETS's fit parameters and the supernovae host galaxies masses, while the Hubble Diagram residues show no correlation with fit parameters, redshift or host galaxy mass. The model nuisance parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, are slighted correlated and we find evidence for redshift evolution for $\beta$. The intrinsic scatter, $\sigma\_{\textrm{int}}$, shows a subtle redshift evolution that should be further investigated increasing the number of high redshift supernovae in the cosmology sample.

2023-10-03, **RESCUER: Cosmological K-corrections for star clusters**, Marta Reina-Campos et.al., [2310.02307v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02307v1)

 The advent of JWST (the James Webb Space Telescope) now allows entire star cluster populations to be imaged in galaxies at cosmologically significant redshifts, bringing with it the need to apply K-corrections to their magnitudes and colour indices. Since the stellar populations within star clusters can be well approximated by a single age and metallicity, their spectral energy distributions are very different from those of galaxies or supernovae, and their K-corrections behave differently. We derive the photometric K-corrections versus redshift for model star clusters that cover a wide range of ages and metallicities, illustrating the results particularly for the broadband filters on the HST/ACS and the JWST/NIRCam cameras that are most commonly being used for imaging of populations of star clusters in distant galaxies. In an Appendix, we introduce a simple webtool called RESCUER that can generate K-values for any user-defined combination of cluster properties.

 We present the continued analysis of polarization and Faraday rotation for the supernova remnants (SNRs) G46.8-0.3 and G39.2-0.3 in L-band (1-2 GHz) radio continuum in The HI/OH/Recombination line (THOR) survey. In this work, we present our investigation of Faraday depth fluctuations from angular scales comparable to the size of the SNRs down to scales less than our 16" beam (<~0.7 pc) from Faraday dispersion (sigma\_phi). From THOR, we find median sigma\_phi of 15.9 +/- 3.2 rad m^-2 for G46.8-0.3 and 17.6 +/- 1.6 rad m^-2 for G39.2-0.3. When comparing to polarization at 6cm, we find evidence for sigma\_phi >~ 30 rad m^-2 in localized regions where we detect no polarization in THOR. We combine Faraday depth dispersion with the rotation measure (RM) structure function (SF) and find evidence for a break in the SF on scales less than the THOR beam. We estimate the RM SF of the foreground interstellar medium (ISM) using the SF of extra-Galactic radio sources (EGRS) and pulsars to find that the RM fluctuations we measure originate within the SNRs for all but the largest angular scales.

 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory that will study the universe at very high energy using atmospheric Cherenkov light. CTAO will comprise over 67 telescopes of three different sizes, located in the northern and southern hemispheres. Among these, the Medium-Sized Telescope (MST) will play a crucial role in CTAO's observations, providing excellent sensitivity and angular resolution for gamma rays in the energy range of 100 GeV to 5 TeV. The MST is based on a modified single-mirror Davies-Cotton design, featuring a segmented mirror with a diameter of 12 meters, a total reflective surface of 88 square meters, and a focal length of 16 meters. It will cover an approximately 8-degree field of view and be equipped with two different cameras: NectarCAM and FlashCam, at the northern and southern CTAO sites, respectively. The MST's design is optimized for efficient observation of extended sources, including supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae, as well as the study of gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. Currently, the MST is in the midst of production and testing stages with the aim of being installed in 2025 for the CTAO Pathfinder project. In this project, one MST telescope will be deployed at each CTAO site to provide on-site experience with pre-production components. This approach facilitates cost and risk reduction before starting serial production. This contribution provides an overview of the current status and plans of the MST's construction at both the northern and southern CTAO sites, as well as details on the telescope and camera designs and their expected performance.

2023-10-03, **On the influence of shock-cloud interactions on the nonthermal X-ray emission from the supernova remnant RCW 86**, Aya Bamba et.al., [2310.01797v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01797v1)

 It is an open issue how the surrounding environment of supernova remnant shocks affect nonthermal X-rays from accelerated electrons, with or without interacting dense material. We have conducted spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of the shock-cloud interacting region of RCW 86 with XMM-Newton. It is found that bright soft X-ray filaments surround the dense cloud observed with 12CO and HI emission lines. These filaments are brighter in thermal X-ray emission, and fainter and possibly softer in synchrotron X-rays, compared to those without interaction. Our results show that the shock decelerates due to the interaction with clouds, which results in an enhancements of thermal X-ray emission. This could possibly also explain the softer X-ray synchrotron component, because it implies that those shocks that move through a low density environment, and therefore decelerate much less, can be more efficient accelerators. This is similar to SN 1006 and Tycho, and is in contrast to RX J1713.7-3946. This difference among remnants may be due to the clumpiness of dense material interacting with the shock, which should be examined with future observations.
