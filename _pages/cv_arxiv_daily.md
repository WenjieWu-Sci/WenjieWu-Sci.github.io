2024-01-08, **CE$ν$NS at the European Spallation Source**, A. Simón et.al., [2401.04074v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04074v2)

 The recent detection of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) opens the possibility to use neutrinos to explore physics beyond standard model, with small-size detectors. However, the CE$\nu$NS process generates signals at the few keV level, requiring very sensitive detector technologies. The European Spallation Source (ESS) has been identified as an optimal source of low energy neutrinos, offering an opportunity for a definitive exploration of all phenomenological applications of CE$\nu$NS. A number of different detector approaches are currently under development for deployment at ESS. These next-generation technologies will be able to observe the process with lower energy threshold and better energy resolution than current detectors. The combination of their observations will allow for a complete phenomenological exploitation of the CE$\nu$NS signal. In particular, these measurements will not be statistically-limited, a result of the large neutrino flux expected at the ESS. The main projects currently being developed to detect CE$\nu$NS at the ESS are presented: the GanESS project which will use high pressure gas TPC filled with different noble gases; the C$^{\circ}\!$sI project, which employs cryogenic undoped CsI crystals; and p-type point contact HPGe detectors.

2024-01-08, **Mathematical methods for neutrino cross-section extraction**, Steven Gardiner et.al., [2401.04065v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04065v1)

 Precise modeling of neutrino-nucleus scattering is becoming increasingly important as accelerator-based oscillation experiments seek definitive answers to open questions about neutrino properties. To guide the needed model refinements, a growing number of experimental collaborations are pursuing a wide-ranging program of neutrino interaction measurements at GeV energies. A key step in most such analyses is cross-section extraction, in which measured event counts are corrected for background contamination and imperfect detector performance to yield cross-section results that are directly comparable to theoretical predictions. In this paper, I review the major approaches to cross-section extraction in the literature using representative examples from the MINERvA, MicroBooNE, and T2K experiments. I then present two mathematical techniques, blockwise unfolding and the conditional covariance background constraint, which overcome some limitations of typical cross-section extraction procedures.

2024-01-08, **On the Nucleosynthesis in Accretion-Induced Collapse of White Dwarfs**, Chun-Ming Yip et.al., [2401.03798v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03798v1)

 It has long been hypothesized that accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs contribute to heavy chemical elements production in the universe. We present one-dimensional neutrino-radiative hydrodynamic simulations of AIC followed by post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations of the ejecta. A proto-neutron star is formed after the AIC, and a neutrino burst with peak luminosity $\sim10^{53}$ erg s$^{-1}$, comparable to that of a core-collapse supernova (CCSN), is emitted. The ejecta mass of AIC could be up to $\sim10^{-2}$ M$\_\odot$, and the first neutron-capture peak elements (Sr, Y, and Zr) could be abundantly synthesized, with an overproduction of $\sim10^{6}$ relative to the solar abundances. The yield of $^{56}\text{Ni}$ could be up to at most $\sim10^{-3}$ M$\_\odot$, suggesting that the electromagnetic light curve associated with AIC is at least $2$ orders dimmer than those associated with Type Ia supernovae (Type Ia SN). The inferred upper bound of AIC event rate, from nucleosynthesis calculations, is at most $\sim10\,\%$ relative to those of CCSNe and Type Ia SNe.

2024-01-08, **String Theory and the First Half of the Universe**, Fien Apers et.al., [2401.04064v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04064v1)

 We perform a detailed study of stringy moduli-driven cosmologies between the end of inflation and the commencement of the Hot Big Bang, including both the background and cosmological perturbations: a period that can cover half the lifetime of the universe on a logarithmic scale. Compared to the standard cosmology, stringy cosmologies motivate extended kination, tracker and moduli-dominated epochs involving significantly trans-Planckian field excursions. Conventional effective field theory is unable to control Planck-suppressed operators and so such epochs require a stringy completion for a consistent analysis. Perturbation growth in these stringy cosmologies is substantially enhanced compared to conventional cosmological histories. The transPlanckian field evolution results in radical changes to Standard Model couplings during this history and we outline potential applications to baryogenesis, dark matter and gravitational wave production.

2024-01-08, **Mono-Higgs and Mono-$Z$ Production in the Minimal Vector Dark Matter Model**, Gonzalo Benítez-Irarrázabal et.al., [2401.03954v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03954v1)

 The Minimal Vector Dark Matter is a viable realization of the minimal dark matter paradigm. It extends the Standard Model by the inclusion of a vector matter field in the adjoint representation of $SU (2)\_L$. The dark matter candidate corresponds to the neutral component of the new vector field ($V^0$). Previous studies have shown that the model can explain the observed dark matter abundance while evading direct and indirect searches. At colliders, the attention has been put on the production of the charged companions of the dark matter candidate. In this work, we focus on the mono-Higgs and mono-$Z$ signals at hadron colliders. The new charged vectors ($V^{\pm}$) are invisible unless a dedicated search is performed. Consequently, we assume that the mono-Higgs and mono-$Z$ processes correspond the $pp\rightarrow h V^{+,0} V^{-,0}$ and $pp\rightarrow Z V^{+,0} V^{-,0}$ reactions, respectively. We show that, while the $p p \rightarrow h V^{+,0} V^{-,0}$ is more important, both channels may produce significant signals at the HL-LHC and colliders running at $\sqrt{s} = 27$ TeV and $100$ TeV, probing almost the complete parameter space.

2024-01-08, **Sub-GeV Dark Matter Annihilation: Limits from Milky Way observations with INTEGRAL**, Thomas Siegert et.al., [2401.03795v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03795v1)

 From 16 years of INTEGRAL/SPI $\gamma$-ray observations, we derive bounds on annihilating light dark matter particles in the halo of the Milky Way up to masses of about 300 MeV. We test four different spatial templates for the dark matter halo, including a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Einasto, Burkert, and isothermal sphere profile, as well as three different models for the underlying diffuse Inverse Compton emission. We find that the bounds on the s-wave velocity-averaged annihilation cross sections for both the electron-positron and the photon-photon final states are the strongest to date from $\gamma$-ray observations alone in the mass range $\lesssim 6$ MeV. We provide fitting formulae for the upper limits and discuss their dependences on the halo profile. The bounds on the two-photon final state are superseding the limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background in the range of 50 keV up to $\sim 3$ MeV, showing the great potential future MeV mission will have in probing light dark matter.

2024-01-08, **Levitated ferromagnetic magnetometer with energy resolution well below $\hbar$**, Felix Ahrens et.al., [2401.03774v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03774v1)

 A quantum limit on the measurement of magnetic field has been recently pointed out, stating that the so-called Energy Resolution $E\_\mathrm{R}$ is bounded to $E\_\mathrm{R} \gtrsim \hbar$. This limit holds indeed true for the vast majority of existing quantum magnetometers, including SQUIDs, solid state spins and optically pumped atomic magnetometers. However, it can be surpassed by highly correlated spin systems, as recently demonstrated with a single-domain spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate. Here we show that similar and potentially much better resolution can be achieved with a hard ferromagnet levitated above a superconductor at cryogenic temperature. We demonstrate $E\_\mathrm{R}=\left( 0.064 \pm 0.010 \right) \, \hbar$ and anticipate that $E\_\mathrm{R}<10^{-3} \, \hbar$ is within reach with near-future improvements. This finding opens the way to new applications in condensed matter, biophysics and fundamental science. In particular, we propose an experiment to search for axionlike dark matter and project a sensitivity orders of magnitude better than in previous searches.

2024-01-08, **Boosted Dark Matter From Centaurus A and Its Detection**, Chen Xia et.al., [2401.03772v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03772v1)

 Dark matter can be boosted by high energy particles in astrophysical environments through elastic scattering. We study the production of boosted dark matter via scattering with electrons in the relativistic jet of the closest active galactic nucleus, Centaurus A, and its detection in the Super-Kamiokande experiment. Since there are a huge number of electrons in the jet and dark matter is extremely dense around the supermassive black hole that powers the jet, the number of boosted dark matter is tremendously large. Compared to boosted dark matter from blazars, the dark matter flux from Centaurus A is enhanced due to the proximity of Centaurus A. The constraint on dark matter-electron scattering cross section set by Super-Kamiokande is more stringent, down to $\sim 10^{-36} \, \mathrm{cm}^2$ for $\mathrm{MeV}$ dark matter.

2024-01-08, **Heavy Hexaquarks in the Flux Tube Model**, Sindhu D G et.al., [2401.03732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03732v1)

 Hexaquarks are one of the currently emerging topics in both experimental and theoretical high energy physics. Hexaquarks have been examined in relation to particle physics, however, there are still some research and theoretical conjectures surrounding their relationship to dark matter. Due to some experimental discoveries, it has attracted much interest and also resulted in new theoretical models to study the properties of these states. In the present work, Regge trajectories of some hexaquark states are compared with tetraquark and pentaquark states. The study is mainly concentrated on fully heavy hexaquark states. The mass spectra of these hexaquark states have also been investigated and the results are compared with other theoretical works. Our findings agree well with those of other researchers.

2024-01-08, **Impact of non-thermal phase-space distributions on dark matter abundance in secluded sectors**, Hugues Beauchesne et.al., [2401.03657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03657v1)

 Many new physics models include secluded sectors that interact little with the Standard Model and whose internal interactions control the dark matter abundance. If these same interactions are responsible for maintaining kinematic equilibrium within the secluded sector, it is possible that the phase-space distributions will differ considerably from their thermal values during freeze-out. This can potentially result in deviations of the dark matter abundance from that computed under the assumption of thermal distributions. In this paper, we revisit dark matter abundance computations for a benchmark secluded sector by numerically tracking the phase-space distributions. Namely, we show that the dark matter abundance can deviate considerably from standard results during the freeze-out process, but that a longer period of annihilation ultimately leaves only a slight excess.

2024-01-08, **Hidden high ionization lines in the low luminosity type II SN 2021gmj**, Nicolas Meza Retamal et.al., [2401.04027v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04027v1)

 We present comprehensive optical observations of SN~2021gmj, a type II supernova (SN~II) discovered within a day of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40~Mpc (DLT40) survey. Follow up observations show that SN~2021gmj is a low luminosity SN~II (LL~SN~II), with a peak magnitude $M\_V = -15.45$ and Fe II velocity of $\sim 1800 \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 50 days past explosion. Using the expanding photosphere method we derive a distance of $17.8^{+0.6}\_{-0.4}$~Mpc. From the tail of the light-curve we obtain a radioactive nickel mass of $0.014 \pm 0.001$ $\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$. The presence of circumstellar material (CSM) is suggested by the early light curve, early spectra and the presence of high velocity H$\alpha$ in absorption. Analytical shock-cooling models of the early light curve cannot reproduce the fast rise, also supporting the idea that the early emission is partially powered by the interaction of the SN ejecta and CSM. The inferred low CSM mass of 0.025 $\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$ in our hydrodynamic-modeling light curve analysis is also consistent with our spectroscopic observations. We observe a broad feature near 4600 A, which may be high ionization lines of C, N or/and He II. This feature is reproduced by radiation hydrodynamic simulations of red supergiants with extended atmospheres. Several LL~SNe~II show similar spectral features implying that high density material around the progenitor may be common among them.
