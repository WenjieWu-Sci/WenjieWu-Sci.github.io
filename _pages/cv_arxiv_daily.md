2023-12-06, **Neutrino-based safeguards of CANDU spent fuel using superconducting detectors and the CE$ν$NS interaction**, M. Stringer et.al., [2312.03586v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03586v1)

 To prevent the unauthorised spread of radioactive materials, it is essential to detect and monitor spent nuclear fuel. This paper investigates the feasibility of using a detector based on transition edge superconductors to monitor spent CANDU fuel in two distinct scenarios. The first of these considered the monitoring of a CANSTOR container at the location of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant. The fuel in a CANSTOR container is contained within baskets, which are then stored in tubes in the container. An individual detector with a mass of 1 kg is not sensitive to the removal of a single basket from the container without an unfeasibly long monitoring time. When an entire tube in the container is emptied (equivalent to approximately 5% of the fuel in the container), the results are improved. The second scenario examined the feasibility of monitoring a single dry storage container (DSC) at the Pickering site. The DSCs are much smaller than a CANSTOR container and contain approximately 7.4 tonnes of spent fuel. The background due to the neutrinos from the nearby reactors at the Pickering site was also evaluated. It was found that monitoring DSC was unfeasible due to the high reactor neutrino background. Both studies utilized fuel that was 30 years old; monitoring a container loaded with spent fuel that is younger would require a shorter monitoring time due to the fuel's higher radioactivity.

2023-12-06, **Successful $νp$-process in neutrino-driven outflows in core-collapse supernovae**, Alexander Friedland et.al., [2312.03208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03208v1)

 The origin of the solar system abundances of several proton-rich isotopes, especially $^{92,94}$Mo and $^{96,98}$Ru, has been an enduring mystery in nuclear astrophysics. An attractive proposal to solve this problem is the $\nu p$-process, which can operate in neutrino-driven outflows in a core-collapse supernova after the shock is launched. Years of detailed studies, however, have cast doubt over the ability of this process to generate sufficiently high absolute and relative amounts of various $p$-nuclei. The $\nu p$-process is also thought to be excluded by arguments based on the long-lived radionuclide $^{92}$Nb. Here, we present explicit calculations, in which both the abundance ratios and the absolute yields of the $p$-nuclei up to $A\lesssim105$ are successfully reproduced, even when using the modern (medium enhanced) triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates. The process is also shown to produce the necessary amounts of $^{92}$Nb. The models are characterized by subsonic outflows and by the protoneutron star masses in the {$\gtrsim1.7 M\_\odot$ range}. This suggests that the Mo and Ru $p$-nuclides observed in the Solar System were made in CCSN explosions characterized by an extended accretion stage.

2023-12-06, **Revisiting the averaged annihilation rate of thermal relics at low temperature**, A. Arbey et.al., [2312.03695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03695v1)

 We derive a low-temperature expansion of the formula to compute the average annihilation rate $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ for dark matter in $\mathbb{Z}\_2$-symmetric models, both in the absence and the presence of mass degeneracy in the spectrum near the dark matter candidate. We show that the result obtained in the absence of mass degeneracy is compatible with the analytic formulae in the literature, and that it has a better numerical behaviour for low temperatures. We also provide as ancillary files two Wolfram Mathematica notebooks which perform the two expansions at any order.

2023-12-06, **DarkSide-20k: Next generation Direct Dark Matter searches with liquid Argon**, I. Manthos et.al., [2312.03597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03597v1)

 DarkSide-20k is a next-generation dual-phase Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber, currently under construction at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy. With a 20 t fiducial mass of liquid Argon, DarkSide-20k will probe WIMP-nucleon interactions down to cross sections equal to 10$^{-48}$ cm$^2$ for a WIMP mass of 0.1 TeV/c$^2$. DarkSide-20k is designed to be a nearly "instrumental background-free" experiment, meaning that less than 0.1 background events are expected in the WIMP search region during the 200 tonne-year planned exposure. To achieve this, the TPC is surrounded by an inner (neutron) and outer (muon) veto, while low-radioactivity underground argon (depleted in $^{39}$Ar), is used as the inner detector (TPC and inner veto) medium. Both the TPC and the veto systems are instrumented with novel cryogenic silicon photomultiplier, capable of resolving single photoelectrons and providing the required spatial and time resolution. An overview of the DarkSide-20k experimental program is reported, with a focus on the photo-detector system construction and testing procedures for the inner veto system.

2023-12-06, **Axion and Dark Fermion Electromagnetic Form Factors in Superfluid He-4**, Wei Chao et.al., [2312.03530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03530v1)

 Condensed matter materials have shown great potential in searching for light dark matter (DM) via detecting the phonon or magnon signals induced by the scattering of DMs off the materials. In this paper, we study the possibility of detecting electromagnetic form factors of fermionic DM and axion-like particles (ALPs) using superfluid Helium-4. The phonon induced by a sub-GeV fermionic DM scattering off the superfluid can be described using the effective field theory with the interaction between DM and the bulk ${}^4$He. Signals arising from the electromagnetic form factors of light DM in the presence of an external electric field are calculated. Projected constraints on the charge radius, the anapole moment, and the magnetic moment of the DM are derived with 1 kg$\cdot$year exposure. The phonon signal induced by the scattering of ALPs off the superfluid is also calculated, which can put competitive and the first direct detection bounds on ALP-photon-dark photon couplings in the projected experiments.

2023-12-06, **A unified linear intrinsic alignment model for elliptical and disc galaxies and the resulting ellipticity spectra**, Basundhara Ghosh et.al., [2312.03353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03353v1)

 Alignments of disc galaxies were thought to result from tidal torquing, where tidal field of the cosmic large-scale structure exert torquing moments onto dark matter haloes, determining their angular momentum and ultimately the orientation of galactic discs. In this model, resulting intrinsic ellipticity correlations are typically present on small scales, but neither observations nor simulations have found empirical evidence; instead, simulations point at the possibility that alignments of disc galaxies follow a similar alignment model as elliptical galaxies, but with a weaker alignment amplitude. In our article we make the case for the theory of linear alignments resulting from tidal distortions of the galactic disc, investigate the physical properties of this model and derive the resulting angular ellipticity spectra, as they would appear as a contribution to weak gravitational lensing in surveys such as Euclid's. We discuss in detail on the statistical and physical properties of tidally induced alignments in disc galaxies, as they are relevant for mitigation of alignment contamination in weak lensing data, comment on the consistency between the alignment amplitude in spiral and elliptical galaxies and finally, estimate their observability with a Euclid-like survey.

2023-12-06, **Gravitational Wave as a Probe of Light Feebly Interacting Dark Matter**, Yuchao Gu et.al., [2312.03349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03349v1)

 Light feebly interacting dark matter is widely predicted in a plethora of new physics models. However, due to very feeble couplings with the Standard Model particles, its relic density produced via the relativistic thermal freeze-out process easily exceeds the observed value. The entropy dilution in an early matter-dominated era provides an attractive mechanism for solving such an overabundance problem. In this work, we note that this dark matter dilution mechanism will lead to two distinctive kinks in the primordial GW spectrum, whose frequencies strongly correlate with the DM mass. We show that the GW detectors, such as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Big Bang Observer (BBO), can measure the kinks in the primordial GW spectrum and will offer a new avenue to probe light feebly interacting dark matter.

2023-12-06, **GA-NIFS: JWST discovers an offset AGN 740 million years after the Big Bang**, Hannah Übler et.al., [2312.03589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03589v1)

 A surprising finding of recent studies is the large number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) associated with moderately massive black holes ($\rm \log(M\_\bullet/M\_\odot)\sim 6-8$), in the first billion years after the Big Bang ($z>5$). In this context, a relevant finding has been the large fraction of candidate dual AGN, both at large separations (several kpc) and in close pairs (less than a kpc), likely in the process of merging. Frequent black hole merging may be a route for black hole growth in the early Universe; however, previous findings are still tentative and indirect. We present JWST/NIRSpec-IFU observations of a galaxy at $z=7.15$ in which we find evidence for a $\rm \log(M\_\bullet/M\_\odot)\sim7.7$ accreting black hole, as traced by a broad component of H$\beta$ emission, associated with the Broad Line Region (BLR) around the black hole. This BLR is offset by 620 pc in projection from the centroid of strong rest-frame optical emission, with a velocity offset of $\sim$40 km/s. The latter region is also characterized by (narrow) nebular emission features typical of AGN, hence also likely hosting another accreting black hole, although obscured (type 2, narrow-line AGN). We exclude that the offset BLR is associated with Supernovae or massive stars, and we interpret these results as two black holes in the process of merging. This finding may be relevant for estimates of the rate and properties of gravitational wave signals from the early Universe that will be detected by future observatories like LISA.
