2023-04-13, **Constraining low-scale dark phase transitions with cosmological observations**, Shihao Deng et.al., [2304.06576v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06576v1)

 We investigate the effects of the low-scale cosmological first-order phase transitions on the neutrino decoupling and constrain the PT parameters with the cosmological observations of big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background. We consider the phase transitions that occur at the MeV-scale which can produce stochastic gravitational wave background to be probed by pulsar timing array experiments. We find that the phase transition can modify the effective number of neutrinos and the primordial nucleosynthesis. In turn, the cosmological observations can exclude slow and strong phase transitions around the MeV scale.

2023-04-13, **Testing electroweak scale seesaw models at $e^{-} γ$ and $γ γ$ colliders**, Arindam Das et.al., [2304.06298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06298v1)

 We investigate the possibilities of probing the electroweak scale seesaw scenarios such as type-I, type-II and type-III seesaw at $e^-\gamma$ and $\gamma\gamma$ colliders. For the case of type-I seesaw, the heavy neutrinos can be produced at $e^{-}\gamma$ colliders in association with a $W$ boson. We study a variety of final states in this case including single and multilepton modes in association with jets to estimate bounds on the light-heavy neutrino mixing angle. In case of type-II seesaw, doubly charged multiplets of the SU$(2)\_L$ triplet scalar can be produced in pair at $\gamma \gamma$ collider. We study the multi-leptonic decay modes coming from this pair production of doubly charged Higgs and show how one can probe neutrino mass hierarchy. We also study same sign $W$ boson production from the doubly charged Higgs to study multilepton modes in association with missing energy. From the type-III seesaw, we study same sign dilepton+jets and trilepton+jets modes at $e^-\gamma$ collider which are coming from the neutral and charged component of the triplet fermion in association with a $W$ boson and $Z$ boson, respectively. Due to the existing limits on the triplet fermions from the LHC we choose heavier mass so that the gauge boson originated from the decay of a neutral multiplet can be sufficiently boosted producing a fat-jet signature in association with same sign dilepton and trilepton. Finally we estimate bounds on the light neutrino-heavy triplet fermion mixing angle and compare with the existing bounds.

2023-04-13, **Neutrino Mass in Non-Supersymmetric $SO(10)$ GUT**, Naoyuki Haba et.al., [2304.06263v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06263v1)

 We study a prediction on neutrino observables in a non-supersymmetric renormalizable $SO(10)$ GUT model that contains a ${\bf 10}$ complex scalar field and a ${\bf 126}$ scalar field whose Yukawa couplings with ${\bf 16}$ matter fields provide the quark and charged lepton Yukawa couplings, neutrino Dirac Yukawa coupling and Majorana mass for the singlet neutrinos. The $SO(10)$ breaking is achieved in two steps by a ${\cal O}(10^{15})$ GeV VEV of a ${\bf 54}$ real scalar field and a ${\cal O}(10^{14})$ GeV VEV of the ${\bf 126}$ field. First, we analyze the gauge coupling unification conditions and determine the VEV of the ${\bf 126}$ field. Next, we constrain the Yukawa couplings of the ${\bf 10}$ and ${\bf 126}$ fields at the scale of the ${\bf 126}$ field's VEV from experimental data on quark and charged lepton masses and quark flavor mixings. Then we express the active neutrino mass with the above Yukawa couplings and the ${\bf 126}$ field's VEV based on the Type-1 seesaw mechanism, and fit neutrino oscillation data, thereby deriving a prediction on poorly or not measured neutrino observables. What distinguishes our work from previous studies is that we do not assign Peccei-Quinn charges on visible sector fields so that the ${\bf 10}$ scalar field and its complex conjugate both have Yukawa couplings with ${\bf 16}$ matter fields. From the fitting of neutrino oscillation data, we find that not only the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, but also the inverted hierarchy can be realized. We also reveal that in the normal hierarchy case, the Dirac CP phase of the neutrino mixing matrix $\delta\_{CP}$ is likely in the ranges of $-2.4<\delta\_{\rm CP}<-1.2$ and $1.2<\delta\_{\rm CP}<2.4$, and not in the region with $\delta\_{\rm CP}\sim\pi$, and that in the normal hierarchy case, $\theta\_{23}$ is likely in the upper octant and in the range of $0.50\lesssim\sin^2\theta\_{23}\lesssim0.55$.

2023-04-13, **Addressing the self-interaction for ELDER dark matter from the 21-cm signal**, Rupa Basu et.al., [2304.06680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06680v1)

 The self-interacting dark matter can affect various cosmological processes. Such interactions can be number conserving (\emph{e.g.} $2 \rightarrow 2$) or number violating (\emph{e.g.} $3 \rightarrow 2,\,4 \rightarrow 2$ etc.). The latter processes where three (or more) dark matter particles undergo self-annihilation/scattering to produce less number of dark matter is termed as ``Cannibalism'' process. In this work, the self-interaction of dark matter and the strength of such interactions are investigated in the light of experimental results of the global 21-cm spectrum of neural hydrogen from the era of cosmic dawn. From the present work, it appears that $2\rightarrow 2$ process is much more dominant over the $3\rightarrow 2$ process. It is also found that such interactions affect the dark matter-baryon elastic scattering cross-section. The study also indicates the presence of multi component dark matter of different mass range in the Universe.

2023-04-13, **Chaotic interactions between dark matter and dark energy**, E. Aydiner et.al., [2304.06614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06614v1)

 In this study, we consider dark matter and dark energy as grand-canonical systems which are open, non-equilibrium coupled, and interacting systems. It is the first time, we propose a new more realistic interaction schema to explain dynamics between coupled interacting thermodynamic systems. Based on this new interaction schema, we propose new theorems to define the interactions. We proved the theorems based on the energy conservation law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, we obtain new coupled equations using the theorems. We numerically solve the interaction equations and obtained phase space diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. We show that the interaction between dark matter and dark energy is chaotic. We conclude that these theorems and results can be generalized to all coupled interacting non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we give a new definition of chaos.

2023-04-13, **On the anti-correlation between pericentric distance and inner dark matter density of Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal galaxies**, Salvador Cardona-Barrero et.al., [2304.06611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06611v1)

 An anti-correlation between the central density of the dark matter halo ($\rho\_{150,\ {\rm DM}}$) and the pericentric distances ($r\_{p}$) of the Milky Way's (MW's) dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) has been reported in the literature. The existence and origin of such anti-correlation is however controversial, one possibility being that only the densest dSphs can survive the tidal field towards the centre of our Galaxy. In this work, we place particular emphasis on quantifying the statistical significance of such anti-correlation, by using available literature data in order to explore its robustness under different assumptions on the MW gravitational potential, and for various derivations of $\rho\_{150}$ and $r\_{p}$. We consider models in which the MW is isolated and has a low ($8.8\times10^{11}\,M\_{\odot}$) and high ($1.6\times10^{12}\, M\_{\odot}$) halo mass, respectively, as well as configurations in which the MW's potential is perturbed by a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) infall. We find that, while data generally support models in which the dSphs' central DM density decreases as a function of their pericentric radius, this anti-correlation is statistically significant at $3\sigma$ level only in $\sim$12$\%$ of the combinations of $\rho\_{150}$ and $r\_{p}$ explored. Moreover, including the impact of the LMC's infall onto the MW weakens or even washes away this anti-correlation, with respect to models in which the MW is isolated. Our results suggest that the strength and existence of such anti-correlation is still debatable: exploring it with high-resolution simulations including baryonic physics and different DM flavours will help us to understand its emergence.

2023-04-13, **On the use of dielectric elements in axion searches with microwave resonant cavities**, Xiran Bai et.al., [2304.06562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06562v1)

 This study explores the primary effects of dielectric materials in a resonant cavity-based search for axion dark matter. While dielectrics prove beneficial in numerous cases, their incorporation may lead to less-than-optimal performance, especially for the lowest TM mode. Additionally, the stronger confinement of the electric field inside the dielectrics can exacerbate mode mixings, in particular for higher-order modes. Case studies have been carried out using a combination of analytical solutions and numerical simulations. The findings indicate dielectric cavities employing the $\text{TM}\_{010}$ mode experience a significant reduction in sensitivity when compared to a similar search conducted in a cavity at equivalent frequency using no dielectrics.

2023-04-13, **Fermionic Dark Matter: Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology**, C. R. Arguüelles et.al., [2304.06329v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06329v1)

 The nature of dark matter (DM) is one of the most relevant questions in modern astrophysics. We present a brief overview of recent results that inquire into a possible fermionic quantum nature of the DM particles, focusing mainly on the interconnection between the microphysics of the neutral fermions {and the macrophysical structure of galactic halos, including their formation both in the linear and non-linear cosmological regimes. We discuss the general relativistic Ruffini-Arg\"uelles-Rueda (RAR) model of fermionic DM in galaxies, its applications to the Milky Way, the possibility that the Galactic center harbors a DM core instead of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), the S-cluster stellar orbits with an in-depth analysis of the S2's orbit including precession, the application of the RAR model to other galaxy types (dwarf, elliptic, big elliptic and galaxy clusters), and universal galaxy relations. All the above focusing on the model parameters constraints, most relevant to the fermion mass. We also connect the RAR model fermions with particle physics DM candidates, self-interactions, and galactic observables constraints. The formation and stability of core-halo galactic structures predicted by the RAR model and their relation to warm DM cosmologies are also treated. Finally, we briefly discuss how gravitational lensing, dynamical friction, and the formation of SMBHs can also probe the DM nature.

2023-04-13, **Exploring Mirror Twin Higgs Cosmology with Present and Future Weak Lensing Surveys**, Lei Zu et.al., [2304.06308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06308v1)

 We explore the potential of precision cosmological data to study non-minimal dark sectors by updating the cosmological constraint on the mirror twin Higgs model (MTH). The MTH model addresses the Higgs little hierarchy problem by introducing dark sector particles. In this work, we perform a Bayesian global analysis that includes the latest cosmic shear measurement from the DES three-year survey and the Planck CMB and BAO data. In the early Universe, the mirror baryon and mirror radiation behave as dark matter and dark radiation, and their presence modifies the Universe's expansion history. Additionally, the scattering between mirror baryon and photon generates the dark acoustic oscillation process, suppressing the matter power spectrum from the cosmic shear measurement. We demonstrate how current data constrain these corrections to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find that for a viable solution to the little hierarchy problem, the proportion of MTH dark matter cannot exceed about $30\%$ of the total dark matter density, unless the temperature of twin photon is less than $30\%$ of that of the standard model photon. While the MTH model is presently not a superior solution to the observed $H\_0$ tension compared to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\Delta N\_{\rm eff}$ model, we demonstrate that it has the potential to alleviate both the $H\_0$ and $S\_8$ tensions, especially if the $S\_8$ tension persists in the future and approaches the result reported by the Planck SZ (2013) analysis. In this case, the MTH model can relax the tensions while satisfying the DES power spectrum constraint up to $k \lesssim 10~h\rm {Mpc}^{-1}$. If the MTH model is indeed accountable for the $S\_8$ and $H\_0$ tensions, we show that the future China Space Station Telescope (CSST) can determine the twin baryon abundance with a $10\%$ level precision.

2023-04-13, **CATS: The Hubble Constant from Standardized TRGB and Type Ia Supernova Measurements**, D. Scolnic et.al., [2304.06693v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06693v1)

 The Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) provides a luminous standard candle for constructing distance ladders to measure the Hubble constant. In practice its measurements via edge-detection response (EDR) are complicated by the apparent fuzziness of the tip and the multi-peak landscape of the EDR. As a result, it can be difficult to replicate due to a case-by-case measurement process. Previously we optimized an unsupervised algorithm, Comparative Analysis of TRGBs (CATs), to minimize the variance among multiple halo fields per host without reliance on individualized choices, achieving state-of-the-art $\sim$ $<$ 0.05 mag distance measures for optimal data. Further, we found an empirical correlation at 5$\sigma$ confidence in the GHOSTS halo survey between our measurements of the tip and their contrast ratios (ratio of stars 0.5 mag just below and above the tip), useful for standardizing the apparent tips at different host locations. Here, we apply this algorithm to an expanded sample of SN Ia hosts to standardize these to multiple fields in the geometric anchor, NGC 4258. In concert with the Pantheon$+$ SN Ia sample, this analysis produces a (baseline) result of $H\_0= 73.22 \pm 2.06$ km/s/Mpc. The largest difference in $H\_0$ between this and similar studies employing the TRGB derives from corrections for SN survey differences and local flows used in most recent SN Ia compilations but which were absent in earlier studies. SN-related differences total $\sim$ 2.0 km/s/Mpc. A smaller share, $\sim$ 1.4 km/s/Mpc, results from the inhomogeneity of the TRGB calibration across the distance ladder. We employ a grid of 108 variants around the optimal TRGB algorithm and find the median of variants is $72.94\pm1.98$ km/s/Mpc with an additional uncertainty due to algorithm choices of 0.83 km/s/Mpc. None of these TRGB variants result in $H\_0$ less than 71.6 km/s/Mpc.

2023-04-13, **The role of previous generations of stars in triggering star formation and driving gas dynamics**, Nicholas P. Herrington et.al., [2304.06659v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06659v1)

 We present hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of sub galactic regions including photoionising and supernova feedack. We aim to improve the initial conditions of our region extraction models by including an initial population of stars. We also investigate the reliability of extracting regions in simulations, and show that with a good choice of region, results are comparable with using a larger region for the duration of our simulations. Simulations of star formation on molecular cloud scales typically start with a turbulent cloud of gas, from which stars form and then undergo feedback. In reality, a typical cloud or region within a galaxy may already include, or reside near some population of stars containing massive stars undergoing feedback. We find the main role of a prior population is triggering star formation, and contributing to gas dynamics. Early time supernova from the initial population are important in triggering new star formation and driving gas motions on larger scales above 100 pc, whilst the ionising feedback contribution from the initial population has less impact, since many members of the initial population have cleared out gas around them in the prior model. In terms of overall star formation rates though, the initial population has a relatively small effect, and the feedback does not for example suppress subsequent star formation. We find that MHD has a relatively larger impact than initial conditions, reducing the star formation rate by a factor of 3 at later times.

2023-04-13, **Cosmological application of the lens-redshift probability distribution with improved galaxy-scale gravitational lensing sample**, Hui Li et.al., [2304.06529v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06529v1)

 We conduct the cosmological analysis by using the lens-redshift distribution test with updated galaxy-scale strong lensing sample, where the considered scenarios involve three typical cosmological models (i.e., $\Lambda$CDM, $\omega$CDM and $\omega\_0\omega\_a$CDM models) and three typical choices (i.e., non-evolving, power-law and exponential forms) for the velocity-dispersion distribution function (VDF) of lens galaxies. It shows that degeneracies between cosmological and VDF parameters lead to the shifts of estimates on the parameters. The limits on $\Omega\_{m0}$ from the lens-redshift distribution are consistent with those from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample at 68.3% confidence level, though the uncertainties on $\Omega\_{m0}$ from the former are about 3 to 8 times larger than those from the latter. The mean values of $\Omega\_{m0}$ shift to the larger values in the power-law VDF case and to the lower values in the exponential VDF case, compared with those obtained in the non-evolving VDF case. In the $\omega$CDM model, the limits on $\omega\_0$, i.e. the dark energy equation of state (EoS), are consistent with those from the Pantheon+ sample at 68.3% confidence level, but the mean values of $\omega\_0$ from the former are significantly smaller than those from the latter. In the $\omega\_0\omega\_a$CDM model, the uncertainties on $\omega\_0$ are dramatically enlarged compared with those obtained in the $\omega$CDM model; moreover, the Markov chains of $\omega\_a$, i.e. the time-varying slope of EoS, do not achieve convergence in the three VDF cases. Overall, the lens-redshift distribution test is more effective on constraining $\Omega\_{m0}$ than on the dark energy EoS.

2023-04-13, **Origin of neutron capture elements with the Gaia-ESO survey: the evolution of s- and r-process elements across the Milky Way**, Marta Molero et.al., [2304.06452v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06452v1)

 We study the abundance patterns and the radial gradients of s-process elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La and Ce), r-process elements (Eu) and mixed-process elements (Mo, Nd and Pr) in the Galactic thin disc by means of a detailed two-infall chemical evolution model for the Milky Way with state-of-the-art nucleosynthesis prescriptions. We consider r-process nucleosynthesis from merging neutron stars (MNS), magneto-rotational supernovae (MR-SNe) and s-process synthesis from low- and intermediate- mass stars (LIMS) and rotating massive stars. The predictions of our model are compared with data from the sixth data release of the Gaia-ESO survey, from which we consider 62 open clusters with age > 0.1 Gyr and 1300 Milky Way disc field stars. We conclude that: i) the [Eu/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] is reproduced by both a prompt and a delayed source, but the quick source completely dominates the Eu production; ii) rotation in massive stars contribute substantially to the s-process elements of the first peak, but MNS and MR-SNe are necessary in order to reproduce the observations; iii) due to the adopted yields, our model overpredicts Pr and underpredicts Nd, while the [Mo/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] is nicely reproduced. For the radial gradients, we conclude that: i) our predicted slope of the [Fe/H] gradient is in agreement with the one observed in open clusters by Gaia-ESO and other high-resolution spectroscopic surveys. ii) The predicted slope of the [Eu/H] radial gradient is steeper than the observed one, independently on how quick the production of Eu is. We discuss the possible causes of this discrepancy in terms of both different Galaxy formation scenarios and stellar radial migration effects. iii) For all the elements belonging to the second s-process peak (Ba, La, Ce) as well as for Pr, we predict a plateau at low Galactocentric distances, which is probably due to the enhanced enrichment from LIMS in the inner regions.

2023-04-13, **Far-infrared Polarization of the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A with SOFIA HAWC+**, Jeonghee Rho et.al., [2304.06291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06291v1)

 We present polarization observations of the young supernova remnant (SNR) Cas A using the High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera-Plus (HAWC+) instrument onboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The polarization map at 154 microns reveals dust grains with strong polarization fractions (5 - 30 percent), supporting previous measurements made over a smaller region of the remnant at 850 microns. The 154 microns emission and the polarization signal is coincident with a region of cold dust observed in the southeastern shell and in the unshocked central ejecta. The highly polarized far-IR emission implies the grains are large (greater than 0.14 microns) and silicate-dominated. The polarization level varies across the SNR, with an inverse correlation between the polarization degree and the intensity and smaller polarization angle dispersion for brighter SNR emission. Stronger polarization is detected between the bright structures. This may result from a higher collision rate between the gas and dust producing a lower grain alignment efficiency where the gas density is higher. We use the dust emission to provide an estimate of the magnetic field strength in Cas A using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The high polarization level is direct evidence that grains are highly elongated and strongly aligned with the magnetic field of the SNR. The dust mass from the polarized region is 0.14+-0.04 Msun, a lower limit of the amount of dust present within the ejecta of Cas A. This result strengthens the hypothesis that core-collapse SNe are an important contributor to the dust mass in high redshift galaxies.
