2025-12-11, **Hiding a Light Vector Boson from Terrestrial Experiments: A Chargephobic Dark Photon**, Haidar Esseili et.al., [2512.10916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10916v1)

 We calculate the terrestrial, astrophysical and cosmological constraints on a light vector boson that couples to an arbitrary combination of the electromagnetic and $B-L$ currents of the Standard Model. The dark photon and a vector boson coupling to $B-L$ are special cases of our generalized flavor-universal anomaly-free vector boson, requiring just one additional parameter (the "dark mixing angle" corresponding to the linear combination of the electromagnetic and $B-L$ currents) beyond that of the overall coupling strength and the vector boson mass, where we focus on the range $1\, {\rm MeV}$ to $60\, {\rm GeV}$. We perform a detailed investigation of a unique combination where the vector boson couplings to electrically charged leptons and protons are highly suppressed: the "chargephobic dark photon". A chargephobic vector boson is very weakly constrained by current terrestrial experiments including beam dumps and collider experiments, since they rely on couplings to electrons and protons. Instead, neutrino scattering experiments (such as COHERENT), astrophysical sources (supernova emission), and cosmology ($ΔN\_{\rm eff}$) provide the strongest constraints due to the nonzero couplings of the chargephobic vector boson to neutrinos and neutrons. Indeed, we find that supernova emission and $ΔN\_{\rm eff}$ provide constraints throughout the space of dark mixing angles, demonstrating their importance to provide model-independent constraints. For nearly all of the parameter space, a chargephobic vector boson is the most weakly constrained anomaly-free vector boson that couples to flavor-independent or flavor-dependent combinations of Standard Model currents. Finally, we highlight the importance of future experiments, including SHiP, that are able to probe new regions of the chargephobic parameter space due to the significantly improved detector capabilities.

2025-12-11, **Cosmic Ray Measurements Using Charge and Light Readout in a Pixelated Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber**, SoLAr Collaboration et.al., [2512.10830v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10830v1)

 Liquid argon time projection chambers have emerged as a competitive technology for detecting solar neutrinos. The SoLAr collaboration was formed to explore argon detectors with pixelated light and charge readout, aiming for high detection efficiency and improved energy resolution. Building on the success of an initial prototype, we present results obtained with a second SoLAr prototype (V2), a $30 \times 30 \times 30$ cm$^{3}$ time projection chamber operated in a cryostat containing several hundred kilograms of liquid argon. We report measurements of cosmic-ray muons using both tracking and calorimetry from light and charge sensors, and we highlight the improved performance achieved through combined charge and light reconstruction. These results demonstrate the promise of dual-readout detectors and motivate future prototyping efforts toward kiloton-scale facilities.

2025-12-11, **Modeling Light Signals Using Data from the First Pulsed Neutron Source Program at the DUNE Vertical Drift ColdBox Test Facility at CERN Neutrino Platform**, A. Paudel et.al., [2512.10790v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10790v1)

 In this paper, we present a first quantitative test of detected light signals produced in a pulsed neutron source run in a small vertical drift LArTPC at the CERN neutrino platform ColdBox test facility. The ColdBox cryostat, detectors, neutron sources, and particle interactions are modeled and simulated using Fluka. A good agreement is found in the detected number of photoelectrons, with values below 650 photoelectrons in both data and simulation, for all four X-ARAPUCA photodetectors on the cathode in the LArTPC. A time constant is also fitted from the neutron-beam-off light signal spectrum and found consistent between data and MC. Several important systematic effects are discussed and serve as guides for future runs at larger LArTPCs.

2025-12-11, **Electroweak right-handed neutrino portal dark matter**, Wan-Zhe Feng et.al., [2512.10762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10762v1)

 We study dark matter coupled to the standard model via electroweak scale right-handed neutrinos in a Type-I seesaw framework. We consider a minimal dark sector containing a fermion $χ$ and a complex scalar $φ$ whose only connection to the standard model is through renormalizable Yukawa interactions with right-handed Majorana neutrinos, thus realizing a neutrino portal after seesaw mixing. We discuss three representative realizations of electroweak right-handed neutrinos arising from the Type-I seesaw mechanism, spanning small, large, and ultraweak couplings to the standard model sector, so that the dark particles can either undergo secluded freeze-out or be produced via freeze-in. Instead of merely estimating the order of magnitude of the seesaw couplings, we use the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to obtain viable seesaw parameter sets consistent with neutrino data and other constraints, and then compute the coupled evolution of the dark particles and right-handed neutrinos, reproducing the observed dark matter relic abundance in representative benchmark scenarios. For the freeze-in case, we show that internal dark sector interactions can significantly modify the predicted relic density: treating each hidden particle as an independent freeze-in component and simply adding late decays can misestimate the final dark matter abundance by $30\%$, or even $95\%$, depending on the type of internal interactions, compared to a full solution of the coupled Boltzmann equations for all dark species, including the dark sector temperature. Electroweak right-handed neutrino portal dark matter thus provides a robust, testable framework that tightly connects neutrino physics, collider searches for heavy neutral leptons, and the cosmological dark matter relic density, offering a well-motivated benchmark for multi-messenger probes at the high energy frontier.

2025-12-11, **Exploring New Propagation Scales With Galactic Neutrinos**, Miller MacDonald et.al., [2512.10744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10744v1)

 The recent observation of high-energy Galactic neutrinos by IceCube allows for searches of new physics affecting neutrino propagation on scales of $O(10^9-10^{15})\,\mathrm{km/GeV}$ in distance over energy. We assess the sensitivity of upcoming measurements of Galactic neutrinos by IceCube and KM3NeT to such new phenomena. We focus on two scenarios: quasi-Dirac neutrinos and neutrino decays. In the quasi-Dirac scenario, we find that joint measurements by IceCube and KM3NeT are sensitive to the mass-squared differences $δm^2 \in \left(10^{-13.5}~\mathrm{eV^2}, 10^{-11.9}~\mathrm{eV^2}\right)$ at the $90\%$ confidence level. For neutrino decays, the same measurements are sensitive to mass over lifetime ratios $m / τ> 10^{-12.3}~\mathrm{eV^2}$ at the same significance. Our results demonstrate that measurements of Galactic neutrinos by a global network of neutrino telescopes can probe signatures of neutrino mass models.

2025-12-11, **Partial $A_4$ flavor symmetry of the leptonic 3HDM**, Bartosz Dziewit et.al., [2512.10736v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10736v1)

 When the Higgs doublets in the 3HDM transform as a flavor triplet of the $A\_4$ group, the lepton mass matrices accommodate the experimental neutrino mixing angles at arbitrary precision while maintaining the correct mass ordering of the charged and neutral leptons, the latter being Dirac neutrinos in the normal spectrum. Under $A\_4$ symmetry, also agreement of the lepton masses with experimental data is obtained for Higgs vacua differing from those for fitting $U\_{\text{PMNS}}$. For groups of order equal or less than 600 no contractions different from the one found for $A\_4$ yield better agreement with experimental data, and the solution structure presented is unique within the set of groups studied.

2025-12-11, **Constraints on the Population of Common Sources of Gravitational Waves and High-Energy Neutrinos with IceCube During the Third Observing Run of the LIGO and Virgo Detectors**, Doğa Veske et.al., [2512.10707v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10707v1)

 The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, such as progenitor dynamics and outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the observation when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Leveraging data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, we conducted an archival investigation of sub-threshold multimessenger events. Complementing previous analyses, we used minimal assumptions to search for common sources of sub-threshold gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino candidates during the third observing run (O3) of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We therefore derive constraints on the rate density of joint sources for each compact binary merger population as a function of the energy emitted in neutrinos. Only a fraction of the gravitational-wave sources emit neutrinos, if the neutrino emission has high bolometric energy ($>10^{52}$ to $10^{54}$ erg).

2025-12-11, **Quantization of massive Dirac neutrinos in external fields**, Maxim Dvornikov et.al., [2512.10587v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10587v1)

 We review the applications of the quantum field theory (QFT) for the description of massive Dirac neutrinos in external fields. Two particular cases of external background are considered. First, we examine neutrinos in background matter. Then, we study neutrinos with anomalous magnetic moments in a magnetic field. In both situations, we derive the operator valued neutrino wavefunctions, accounting for external fields, which obey the canonical anticommutation relations. Then, we check that the total energy and momentum of a neutrino field have the appropriate forms. Using the exact solution in a Dirac equation in a magnetic field, we also derive the propagator for a massive Dirac neutrino in this external background. The results obtained are of importance for the QFT application to neutrino oscillations in external fields.

2025-12-11, **Renormalization group evolution induced breaking of $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry in MSSM with effects of variation of $tanβ$**, Chandan Kumar Borah et.al., [2512.10586v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10586v1)

 We study the renormalization group (RG) evolution induced breaking of $μ$--$τ$ reflection symmetry in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), with a special focus on the effects of varying $\tanβ\equiv v\_u/v\_d$, the ratio of MSSM Higgs vacuum expectation values. Starting from an exact $μ$--$τ$ reflection symmetry imposed at a high flavor symmetry scale $Λ\_{\text{FS}}$, we run the complete set of coupled RGEs for neutrino masses, mixing angles, and CP-violating phases down to the electroweak scale, imparting perturbation to the symmetry. We consider a specific value of the SUSY breaking scale, $Λ\_s=7\ TeV$ during the run. By choosing suitable free parameters at the high-energy scale, we reproduce the low-energy experimental constraints on neutrino observables consistent with $3ν$ global analysis data. We then examine how the breaking of $μ$--$τ$ reflection symmetry is influenced by different values of $\tanβ$, considering three benchmark choices. In addition, the analysis is performed for both normal ordering (NO) and inverted ordering (IO) of neutrino masses to highlight potential differences in their RG running behavior.

2025-12-11, **Neutrino oscillations in a Kalb-Ramond black hole background**, Yuxuan Shi et.al., [2512.10557v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10557v1)

 The analysis examines how neutrinos behave when their trajectories unfold around a black hole sourced by a Kalb-Ramond field, where spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking reshapes the surrounding geometry. Instead of following the conventional order, the study focuses first on the observable consequences: alterations in the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation energy output, shifts in the oscillation phase accumulated along the path, and distortions in flavor conversion probabilities induced by gravitational lensing. These features are then tied to the Lorentz-violating spacetime structure, which governs the propagation of the neutrinos. Numerical simulations are carried out for both two- and three-flavor descriptions, with normal and inverted mass orderings.

2025-12-11, **Ultra-Fast Muon Transport via Histogram Sampling on GPUs**, Luis Felipe P. Cattelan et.al., [2512.10520v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10520v1)

 We present a GPU-accelerated method for muon transport based on histogram sampling that delivers orders of magnitude faster performance than CPU-based Geant4 simulation. Our method employs precomputed histograms of momentum loss and scattering, derived from detailed Geant4 simulations, to statistically reproduce all the non-decaying physics processes during muon traversal through matter. Implemented as a CUDA kernel, the parallel algorithm enables the concurrent simulation of tens of thousands of particles on a single GPU whilst taking into account a complex geometry and a magnetic field force integrated using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Validation against Geant4 in both simple and realistic detector geometries shows that the approach preserves key physical features while achieving speedups of several orders of magnitude, even compared to CPU-based simulations on a large CPU farm with over a thousand cores. This work highlights the significant potential of GPU-based implementations for particle transport, with applicability extending to neutrino propagation and future implementations including discrete processes such as particle decay.

2025-12-11, **Electromagnetic leptogenesis -- an EFT-consistent analysis via Wilson coefficients. Part III. Probing light-neutrino masses and low-energy observables**, Rin Takada et.al., [2512.10444v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10444v1)

 In this third part of our EFT-consistent analysis of electromagnetic leptogenesis, we confront the dipole operator that sources the baryon asymmetry with constraints from light-neutrino masses and low-energy observables. Starting from the UV completion and one-loop-matched Wilson coefficient $C\_{NB}$ of the gauge-invariant operator $O\_{NB}=(\bar{L}σ^{μν}P\_RN)\tilde{H}B\_{μν}$, we compute the radiatively induced Weinberg operator $O\_5$ and derive the light Majorana mass matrix generated by a double insertion of $O\_{NB}$. For the benchmarks that realise successful resonant electromagnetic leptogenesis at the electroweak scale, these contributions yield neutrino masses far below the scale implied by neutrino oscillation data, so that the observed neutrino masses must originate from additional interactions such as one of the seesaw mechanisms, and only in extreme corners of parameter space do they saturate the cosmological bound on $\sum m\_ν$. We also show that no additional Dirac neutrino mass is generated at one loop by the dipole operator alone. Furthermore, we derive the charged-lepton dipole operator $O\_{eγ}$ in LEFT, accounting for one-loop operator mixing in the symmetric phase and two-loop Barr--Zee--type graphs in the broken phase, and evolve its Wilson coefficient $C\_{eγ}$ down to the muon and electron mass scales using QED renormalisation-group equations. The resulting analytic upper bounds on $\mathrm{BR}(μ\to eγ)$, the electron EDM, and $(g-2)\_μ$ lie many orders of magnitude below current experimental sensitivities throughout the BAU-compatible region. Electromagnetic leptogenesis in this EFT framework is therefore robust against present constraints from light-neutrino masses and low-energy dipole probes.

2025-12-11, **A Systematic Study of Magnetic Fields Impacts on Neutrino Transport in Core-Collapse Supernovae**, Yudong Luo et.al., [2512.10417v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10417v1)

 We quantify the impact of strong magnetic fields (assuming $B=B\_0\cdot r\_0^3/r^3$ with $B\_0\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G) on the neutrino transport in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Magnetic fields quantize the momenta of electrons and positrons, resulting in an enhanced absorption cross section for low-energy neutrinos and suppressed chemical potentials for $e^\pm$. We include these changes in the M1 scheme for neutrino transport and perform 1-D CCSNe simulations with \texttt{GR1D}. The increased low-energy cross sections reduce the $\barν\_e$ mean energy $\langle E\_{\barν\_e}\rangle$ while elevating the neutrino number luminosities $\mathcal{L\_ν}$ for both $ν\_e$ and $\barν\_e$ due to the lower energy weighted spectra. The reduction of chemical potential enhances the $\barν\_e$ emission while suppressing that of $ν\_e$, thereby driving an increase in the electron fraction behind the stalled shock at $\sim30$--$100$ km. This further amplifies $\langle E\_{ν\_e}\rangle$ through an increased electron density. Consequently, magnetic fields amplify $L\_{ν\_e}$ by increasing both $\mathcal{L}\_{ν\_e}$ and $\langle E\_{ν\_e}\rangle$ whereas for $\barν\_e$, the rise in $\mathcal{L}\_{\barν\_e}$ is offset by a decreased $\langle E\_{\barν\_e}\rangle$, leading to a minimal change in $L\_{\barν\_e}$. A systematic parameter scan of dipole field configurations suggests that, for $r\_0 > 30$ km, $\langle E\_{\barν\_e} \rangle$ is significantly suppressed and $L\_{ν\_e}$ is enhanced if $B\_0 \geq {2.7} \times 10^{16}$ G. These magnetic effects become negligible for $B\_0$ below $\sim {7.4} \times 10^{15}$ G.

2025-12-11, **Relaxation of time-variable neutron-loaded relativistic jets across the photosphere and their GeV-TeV neutrino counterparts**, Kanako Nakama et.al., [2512.10253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10253v1)

 Both observational and theoretical studies indicate that the central engine of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is intrinsically time-variable, implying jet inhomogeneity. A jet with an inhomogeneous Lorentz factor distribution develops internal shocks both below and above the photosphere, relaxing toward homologous expansion. Below the photosphere, neutrons, whose mean free paths are much longer than those of charged particles, play an essential role in the dissipation process. Using neutron-inclusive shell simulations with initial conditions based on the collapsar scenario, we link the statistical inhomogeneity of the jet at the breakout of the progenitor to the dissipation that occurs inside and outside the photosphere, and calculate the GeV-TeV neutrino counterpart originated from inelastic neutron-proton interactions consistently with the prompt gamma-ray emission. We find that the peak energy of the GeV-TeV neutrinos is in 10-30 GeV irrespective to the baryon loading factor of the jet, with the high-energy tail extending into the TeV range as the amplitude of the time variability becomes stronger. When gamma-ray emission is efficient as in typical GRBs (i.e., the gamma-ray radiation efficiency with respect to the total jet power is approximately 100%, the radiative efficiency of GeV-TeV neutrinos remains 0.1-10%. By contrast, when the gamma-ray radiation efficiency is relatively low (< 10%) for jets where a large fraction of the energy is dissipated below the photosphere, the neutrino efficiency can increase up to 20%. This suggests that GRBs with relatively low gamma-ray luminosities, as well as X-ray-rich transients, can be promising targets for ongoing and future GeV-TeV neutrino transient searches.

2025-12-11, **Detection prospects for heavy WIMP dark matter near supermassive black holes, particularly in M31**, Andrei E. Egorov et.al., [2512.10923v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10923v1)

 This work analyzes the detection prospects for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in dark matter (DM) density spikes around nearby supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by observations in very high energy gamma-ray band. Such spikes are unique targets, which provide a possibility to discover the basic thermal s-wave annihilating WIMP with any mass up to the theoretical unitarity limit ~ 100 TeV. All relevant SMBHs were checked, and only MW* and M31* were identified as worthwhile objects. Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) sensitivity to heavy WIMPs in M31* was estimated. It was obtained that CTA will be able to probe a major part of TeV-scale WIMP parameter space in case of optimistic spike density configuration in M31*. In certain scenarios, M31* may yield even stronger constraints than MW*. Relevant systematic uncertainties were explored.

2025-12-11, **Updated and Projected Cosmic Microwave Background Bounds on WIMP Annihilation**, Charlotte Myers et.al., [2512.10896v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10896v1)

 We derive updated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints on annihilating dark matter, and present forecasts for upcoming CMB surveys. We show that the addition of recent temperature, polarization, and lensing data from ground-based experiments yields only minor improvements ($\approx 10\%$) compared to Planck bounds, confirming that the sensitivity remains dominated by the large-scale E-mode polarization. Forecasts, using a LiteBIRD-like setup, indicate that pairing a low-noise, wide-sky satellite at $\ell < 200$ with high-resolution ground observations nearly saturates the cosmic-variance limit, improving bounds by $\approx 60\%$, where our derived 95th percentile limit is $p\_{\rm ann} < 1.27{\times}10^{-28}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}\,GeV^{-1}}$. We also consider the inclusion of B-mode polarization for a realistic future experiment.

2025-12-11, **Weighing the Milky Way's Satellite Galaxies Using Pulsar Accelerations**, Thomas Donlon et.al., [2512.10883v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10883v1)

 The properties of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way (MW) are useful for testing models of the formation of our Galaxy, and by extension various theories of cosmology. Recent efforts to measure the masses of the MW's satellite dwarf galaxies have relied on the motions and positions of stars in the MW's disk and halo, which are perturbed by the passage of satellite galaxies. As there are many known processes in our Galaxy that lead to observed disequilibrium in stars, these kinematic methods have been limited by the inherent difficulty in identifying only the perturbations due to particular satellite galaxies. We present a novel method for determining the masses of two MW satellite galaxies -- the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Sgr dSph) -- using only direct, instantaneous acceleration data derived from extremely precise timing of millisecond pulsars near the Sun. As the LMC and Sgr dSph orbit the MW, they cause wave-like distortions in the structure of the disk plus a large-scale offset in the centers of mass of the dark matter halo and the baryonic disk. These two effects lead to asymmetric accelerations above and below the disk midplane near the Sun, which is observed in the pulsar acceleration data. Notably, the amplitude of this asymmetry is shown to depend on the masses of the orbiting satellites. We analyze a grid of simulations with varying masses of each satellite. We find the total (dark + baryon) mass enclosed within the tidal radius at the present day for the LMC to be 4.1 $\pm$ 1.0 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$\_\odot$ within a radius of 16.6 kpc, and for Sgr to be 3.5 $\pm$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^8$ M$\_\odot$ within a radius of 5 kpc. These results are generally consistent and competitive with previous determinations of the masses of these objects, but entirely independent of any stellar kinematic data for the first time.

2025-12-11, **Measuring the neutron star equation of state from EMRIs in dark matter environments with LISA**, Theophanes K. Karydas et.al., [2512.10855v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10855v1)

 Gravitational-wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in vacuum are largely insensitive to the internal structure of the small compact companion. We show that this conclusion can change when the central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter environment. We compute, for the first time, the relativistic dynamical-friction force on a neutron star moving through a collisionless medium and its impact on the evolution of EMRIs embedded in dense dark matter spikes. We then perform a Bayesian parameter-estimation analysis of simulated LISA observations to assess the measurability of both spike properties and the companion's internal structure. We find that, in our fiducial dark matter spike models, EMRIs with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\gtrsim 20$ already allow us to distinguish neutron star from black hole companions, while events with SNR $\gtrsim 400$ make it possible to discriminate between different neutron star equations of state.

2025-12-11, **Pressure and Star Formation in LITTLE THINGS Dwarf Irregular Galaxies**, Bruce G. Elmegreen et.al., [2512.10776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10776v1)

 The surface densities of star formation, Sigma\_SFR, in 24 dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS survey are combined with gas surface densities and midplane pressures to examine the correlations found previously for spiral galaxies. The pressure is the weight of the disk inside the gas layer, including gas, stars, and dark matter, which usually dominates disk gravity in dIrrs. We compare the results to the outer part of M33, which has similar local properties but a slightly higher metallicity, enabling the detection of CO. All the data are convolved to the HI beam, but to study the effects of resolution, the galaxies are examined first with average radial profiles, and then with maps having 1.5" pixels and 244 pc pixels. The correlations are found to be independent of resolution from 24 pc to 424 pc. The average ratio of molecular to atomic surface density is estimated to be 0.23+-0.1, from the H\_2 surface density in M33 compared to the HI surface density at the same Sigma\_SFR in the dIrrs. With this ratio, the average star formation rate per molecule is about the same for all the dIrrs, and a factor of 2 less than the rate in M33. The pressure in dIrrs is so low that CO is essentially a dense gas tracer, with the same surface density threshold at the low metallicities of dIrrs as HCN has in spiral galaxies. As a result, CO regions in dIrrs should be strongly self-gravitating.

2025-12-11, **BinaryGFH-v2: Improved method to search for gravitational waves from sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact binaries using the Generalized Frequency-Hough Transform**, Andrew L. Miller et.al., [2512.10539v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10539v1)

 Observing gravitational waves from sub-solar-mass, inspiraling compact binaries would provide almost smoking-gun evidence for primordial black holes. Here, we develop a method to search for ultra-compact binaries with chirp masses ranging from $[10^{-2},10^{-1}]M\_\odot$. This mass range represents a previously unexplored gap in gravitational-wave searches for compact binaries: it was thought that the signals would too long for matched-filtering analyses but too short for time-frequency pattern-recognition techniques. Despite this, we show that a pattern-recognition technique, the Generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), can be employed with particular modifications that allow us to handle rapidly spinning-up binaries and to increase the statistical robustness of our method, and call this improved method BinaryGFH-v2. We then design a hypothetical search for binaries in this mass regime, compare the empirical and theoretical sensitivities of this method, and project constraints on formation rate densities and the fraction of dark matter that primordial black holes could compose in both current- and future-generation gravitational-wave detectors. Our results show that our method can be used to search for sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact objects in a mass regime that remains to-date unconstrained with gravitational waves.

 Nonlocal modifications of gravity derive from corrections to the quantum gravitational stress tensor which grow nonperturbatively strong during primordial inflation and may persist to the current epoch. Phenomenological constructions have been given that realize MOND in gravitationally bound systems and, separately, reproduce all the cosmological phenomena usually ascribed to dark matter, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, baryon acoustic oscillations and linearized structure formation. In this work we exhibit a single model that interpolates between the two regimes.

2025-12-11, **5D Rotating Black Holes as dark matter in Dark Dimension Scenario: Hawking Radiation versus the Memory Burden Effect**, George K. Leontaris et.al., [2512.10381v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10381v1)

 This work explores the possibility that five-dimensional primordial rotating black holes could account for all, or a significant portion, of the dark matter in our universe. Our analysis is performed within the context of the ``dark dimension'' scenario, a theoretical consequence of the Swampland Program that predicts a single micron-scale extra dimension to explain the observed value of dark energy. We demonstrate that within this scenario, the mass loss of a primordial rotating black hole sensitive to the fifth dimension is significantly slower than that of its four-dimensional counterpart. Consequently, primordial black holes with an initial mass of $M\gtrsim 10^{10}$g can survive to the present day and potentially constitute the dominant form of dark matter. Finally, we investigate the memory burden effect and find that it dramatically prolongs the lifetime of five-dimensional rotating primordial black holes, making them compelling candidates for all the dark matter in the universe.

2025-12-11, **Applying the BF method on the DESI evidence for dynamical dark energy models**, Ziad Sakr et.al., [2512.10763v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10763v1)

 Recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the DESI, when combined with CMB data and Type Ia supernovae observations, indicate a preference for dynamical dark energy when considering the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model, over the standard ΛCDM or the wCDM model. However, the Bayes factor, a key metric for model comparison, remains inconclusive on which model is preferred. This paper applies the BF method, that integrates both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to DESI data to address the limitations of purely frequentist or Bayesian methods. It consists in considering the Bayes factor as a random variable and calculates its distribution, that results from values computed in a frequentist approach after perturbing the data following the model considered. We apply this hybrid method to DESI data, comparing the CPL and w models under various prior conditions, including weak and strong priors, and theory-informed priors. We find that, when the traditional bayes factor is considered, that weak priors favor the w model over CPL, while strong priors favor CPL. Additionally, theory-informed priors further enhance the preference for the w model. While when we apply the BF method, the preference for CPL over w is seen in all cases albeit with similar but reduced impact on the p-value from the different prior considerations. We also tried to generalize further, by perturbing as well the covariance matrix following the model considered, and found that, in general, the current data in that case is not stringent enough to disentangle between the two models. Our results demonstrate that varying the Bayes factor as a random variable, providing that the covariance matrix is kept as model independent, provides a robust model comparison, reducing the impact of prior dependence as well as offering quantitative assessment of the preferences of the competing models.(abridged)

 We investigate whether the recent DESI DR2 measurements provide or not evidences for dynamical dark energy by exploring the $ω\_0ω\_a$CDM model and its extensions with free $\sum m\_ν$ and $N\_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Using a comprehensive MCMC analysis with a wide range of cosmological datasets including DESI~DR2 BAO and Ly$α$ data, CMB compressed likelihoods, BBN, cosmic chronometers, and multiple Type~Ia supernova compilations, we assess the statistical preference for departures from $Λ$CDM.

 The Near Ultraviolet Transient Explorer (NUTEx) is a CubeSat-based near-ultraviolet (NUV) imaging payload designed for transient sky surveys and is currently under development. CubeSats are compact and cost-effective satellite platforms that have emerged as versatile tools for scientific exploration and technology demonstrations in space. NUTEx is an imaging telescope operating in the 200-300 nm wavelength range, intended for deployment on a micro-satellite bus. The optical system is based on a Ritchey Chretien (RC) telescope configuration, featuring a 146 mm primary mirror. The detector is a photon-counting microchannel plate (MCP) device with a solar-blind photocathode, paired with an in-house developed readout unit. The instrument has a wide field of view (FoV) of 4 deg, a peak effective area of approximately 18 sq cm at 260 nm, and can reach a sensitivity of 21 AB magnitude (SNR = 5) in a 200 second exposure. The primary scientific objective of NUTEx is to monitor the night sky for transient phenomena, such as supernova remnants, flaring M-dwarf stars, and other short-timescale events. The payload is currently scheduled for launch in Q2 2026. This paper presents the NUTEx instrument design, outlines its scientific goals and capabilities, and provides an overview of the electronics and mechanical subsystems, including structural analysis.

2025-12-11, **Cosmological and lunar laser ranging constraints on evolving dark energy in a nonminimally coupled curvature-matter gravity model**, Riccardo March et.al., [2512.10530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10530v1)

 We analyze a cosmological solution to the field equations of a modified gravity model where curvature and matter are nonminimally coupled. The current Universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a cosmological constant while the impact of the nonminimal coupling on the expansion history is recast as an effective equation of state for evolving dark energy. The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data. We find that a variety of model parameters are consistent with both of these constraints, all while producing a dynamical evolution of dark energy with similarities to that found in recent DESI results.

 The double pulsar system PSR~J0737$-$3039A/B has enabled some of the most precise tests of strong-field gravity to date. Here, we present a scintillation analysis of the system based on an 18-month observation campaign with the MeerKAT radio telescope. We characterise this interference pattern to infer properties of scattering plasma and the orbital geometry of the system. Our preferred model supports a scattering screen located at a distance of $D\_s = 360^{+30}\_{-40}$ pc. This moderately anisotropic screen of ionized gas (axial ratio $A\_R = 2.4 \pm 0.2$) lies near the edge of the Gum Nebula, which is believed to be a supernova remnant (SNR) or an \HII\, region. We estimate the expansion velocity of the nebula to be $V\_{\textrm{s}} = 35 \pm 5$ km s$^{-1}$, implying a SNR age of $t \approx 1$ Myr. We also constrain the orbital orientation and inclination sense of the double pulsar to be $Ω= 40^{\circ} \pm 3^{\circ}$ and $i > 90^{\circ}$, respectively. Assuming standard scattering geometry, our model yields a distance estimate consistent with the parallax-derived value of $D = 770 \pm 70$ pc from very long baseline interferometry. We conclude by discussing how future models of pulsar scintillation can enhance our understanding of the IISM and the properties of pulsars embedded within or lying behind such intervening structures.

2025-12-11, **$^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 Observations of Tycho's supernova remnant: constraints on the environmental gas properties**, Sendi Bo et.al., [2512.10245v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10245v1)

 Recent observations suggest that Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR; SN 1572) is expanding into a cavity wall of molecular clouds (MCs), which decelerate the SNR and influence its multi-wavelength morphology. To constrain the physical properties of environmental MCs and search for heated gas, we perform a JCMT $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 observation and compare with previous $^{12}$CO $J$=2--1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1--0 and $^{13}$CO $J$=1--0 data. We present the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 map toward Tycho and show that the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 spatial distribution and line profiles are similar to those of the lower-$J$ CO lines. By comparing the multiple transitions of CO and the RADEX (Radiative transfer code in non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) models, we constrain the physical properties of molecular gas surrounding Tycho: the northern cloud has a molecular column density of $N({\rm H}\_{2})=0.5$ -- $4.5\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, while other regions have $N({\rm H}\_{2})=0.2$ -- $3.9\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$; the kinetic temperatures $T\_{\rm k}$ of these clouds are in the range of 9 -- 22 K and the volume densities $n({\rm H}\_{2})$ are 20 -- $700$ cm$^{-3}$. We also discuss the difficulty in finding hot molecular gas shocked by such a young SNR. We estimate that the shocked molecular layer can be as thin as 0.003 pc, corresponding to $0.2''$ at the distance of 2.5 kpc, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the angular resolution of current CO observations. Therefore, our molecular observations are largely insensitive to the thin shocked gas layer; instead, they detect the environmental gas.

2025-12-11, **EP250827b/SN 2025wkm: An X-ray Flash-Supernova Powered by a Central Engine and Circumstellar Interaction**, Gokul P. Srinivasaragavan et.al., [2512.10239v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10239v1)

 We present the discovery of EP250827b/SN 2025wkm, an X-ray Flash (XRF) discovered by the Einstein Probe (EP), accompanied by a broad-line Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) at $z = 0.1194$. EP250827b possesses a prompt X-ray luminosity of $\sim 10^{45} \, \rm{erg \, s^{-1}}$, lasts over 1000 seconds, and has a peak energy $E\_{\rm{p}} < 1.5$ keV at 90% confidence. SN 2025wkm possesses a double-peaked light curve (LC), though its bolometric luminosity plateaus after its initial peak for $\sim 20$ days, giving evidence that a central engine is injecting additional energy into the explosion. Its spectrum transitions from a blue to red continuum with clear blueshifted Fe II and Si II broad absorption features, allowing for a SN Ic-BL classification. We do not detect any transient radio emission and rule out the existence of an on-axis, energetic jet $\gtrsim 10^{50}~$erg. In the model we invoke, the collapse gives rise to a long-lived magnetar, potentially surrounded by an accretion disk. Magnetically-driven winds from the magnetar and the disk mix together, and break out with a velocity $\sim 0.35c$ from an extended circumstellar medium with radius $\sim 10^{13}$ cm, generating X-ray breakout emission through free-free processes. The disk outflows and magnetar winds power blackbody emission as they cool, producing the first peak in the SN LC. The spin-down luminosity of the magnetar in combination with the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni produces the late-time SN LC. We end by discussing the landscape of XRF-SNe within the context of EP's recent discoveries.
