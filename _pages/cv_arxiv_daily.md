2025-01-08, **The ENUBET monitored neutrino beam and its implementation at CERN**, ENUBET collaboration et.al., [2501.04531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04531v1)

 The ENUBET project recently concluded the R&D for a site independent design of a monitored neutrino beam for high precision cross section measurements, in which the neutrino flux is inferred from the measurement of charged leptons in an instrumented decay tunnel. In this phase three fundamental results were obtained and will be discussed here: 1) a beamline not requiring a horn and relying on static focusing elements allows to perform a $\nu\_e$ cross section measurement in the DUNE energy range with 1% statistical uncertainty employing $10^{20}$ 400 GeV protons on target (pot) and a neutrino detector of the size of ProtoDUNE; 2) the instrumentation of the decay tunnel, based on a cost effective sampling calorimeter solution, has been tested with a large scale prototype achieving the performance required to identify positrons and muons from kaon decays with high signal-to-noise ratio; 3) the systematics budget on the neutrino flux is constrained at the 1% level by fitting the charged leptons observables measured in the decay tunnel. Based on these successful results ENUBET is now pursuing a study for a site dependent implementation at CERN in the framework of Physics Beyond Colliders. In this context a new beamline, able to enrich the neutrino flux at the energy of HK and to reduce by more than a factor 3 the needed pot, has been designed and is being optimized. The civil engineering and radioprotection studies for the siting of ENUBET in the North Area towards the two ProtoDUNEs are also in the scope of this work, with the goal of proposing a neutrino cross section experiment in 2026. The combined use of both the neutrino detectors and of the improved beamline would allow to perform cross section measurements with unprecedented precision in about 5 years with a proton request compatible with the needs of other users after CERN Long Shutdown 3.

2025-01-08, **The probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrino in Quantum Field Theory**, Takuya Morozumi et.al., [2501.04320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04320v1)

 We derive the probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrinos based on quantum field theory. Since the Hamiltonian under the Majorana mass term does not conserve lepton number, the eigenstates of lepton number change continuously over time. Therefore, the transition amplitude is described by the inner product of the eigenstates of lepton number at the time of the neutrino production and the detection. With the Bogoliubov transformation, we successfully relates the lepton number eigenstates at different times. This method enables us to understand the time variation of lepton number induced by chiral oscillations in terms of transition probabilities. We also present the physical picture that emerges through the Bogoliubov transformation.

2025-01-08, **Testing non-standard neutrino properties**, Manibrata Sen et.al., [2501.04309v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04309v1)

 Neutrinos provide a compelling avenue to explore physics beyond the Standard Model. This proceeding is a brief summary of a plenary talk given at the 12th Neutrino Oscillation Workshop (NOW2024). We present a discussion on various topics on neutrino non-standard properties, such as the origin of neutrino mass, their decay modes, interaction mechanisms, and a potential connection to dark matter. Constraints and observational results from cosmology, astrophysics, and laboratory experiments are reviewed to illustrate the interplay between neutrino physics and broader questions about the universe.

2025-01-08, **Searching for dark matter annihilating into light-long-lived mediators from stars inside dwarf spheroidal galaxies**, Aman Gupta et.al., [2501.04663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04663v1)

 Several astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of dark matter (DM) through its gravitational effects, yet its nature remains elusive. Despite the lack of DM signals from direct detection experiments, efforts continue to focus on the indirect detection of DM from DM-rich astrophysical objects. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are among the most promising targets for such searches. In this work, we aim to investigate the expected DM capture rate from the stellar component of 10 nearby DM-rich dSphs, assuming that the accumulated DM eventually annihilates into light, long-lived mediators (LLLMs) which decay into gamma rays outside the dSphs. We analyze nearly 16 years of {\it Fermi}-LAT data to search for DM annihilation through LLLMs, and, from the observed stacked flux upper limits, set limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section using model-independent methods. Additionally, we incorporate the Sommerfeld Enhancement (SE) effect into the DM annihilation process, obtaining bounds on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section of $\sim~10^{-36} {\rm cm}^2$ for DM masses around 100 GeV. This allows us to explore an alternative avenue for exploring DM phenomena from dSphs and compare our results with the bounds reported by direct DM detection experiments and other celestial bodies.

2025-01-08, **Dark matter effects on the properties of quark stars and the implications for the peculiar objects**, Hong-Ming Liu et.al., [2501.04382v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04382v1)

 We systematically investigate the observable properties of dark matter-admixed quark stars (DQSs) using the confined-isospin-density-dependent-mass model in combination with the generic bosonic self-interacting dark matter model. Our results show that the dark matter (DM) can significantly influence the properties of quark stars including the mass, radius, and the central pressure at the maximum mass configurations. Moreover, we observe that the mass of DMparticles and the DMfraction significantly affect the types of stellar configurations, and we study these configurations in detail under various scenarios and predict the possibility that two recently observed peculiar objects HESS J1731-347 and PSR J014-4002E are DQSs.
