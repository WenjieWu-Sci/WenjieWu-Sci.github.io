2024-06-27, **Probing self-interacting ultra-high-energy neutrinos with cosmic 21-cm signal**, Mansi Dhuria et.al., [2406.19279v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19279v1)

 In this study, we investigate the constraints on secret self-interactions of neutrinos by examining the impact of radiative scattering of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. These neutrinos are produced from the decay of superheavy dark matter and interact with the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). We explore how these interactions influence the 21-cm hydrogen signal during the cosmic dark ages and cosmic dawn, periods relatively free from astrophysical uncertainties, providing a clearer signal for studying non-standard neutrino interactions. By analyzing the global brightness temperature measurements, we constrain the scattering cross-section of UHE self-interacting neutrinos, determining the coupling constant $g$ to be within $\sim 10^{-4}$ to $\sim 10^{-3}$ for neutrino energies in the PeV to EeV range. Interestingly, these constraints are more competitive than those from existing astrophysical and collider experiments. As future 21-cm experiments focus on measuring brightness temperature across a wide range of redshifts from the cosmic dark ages to reionization, using the epoch of 21-cm to probe neutrino properties could provide crucial insights into dark matter and neutrino physics.

2024-06-27, **Loop-induced masses for the first two generations with optimum flavour violation**, Gurucharan Mohanta et.al., [2406.19179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19179v1)

 A mechanism for the masses of third, second, and first generation charged fermions at the tree, 1-loop, and 2-loop levels, respectively, is proposed. The fermionic self-energy corrections that lead to this arrangement are induced through heavy vector bosons of a new gauged flavour symmetry group $G\_F$. It is shown that a single Abelian group suffices as $G\_F$. Moreover, the gauge charges are optimized to result in relatively smaller flavour violations in processes involving the first and second generation fermions. The scheme is explicitly implemented on the Standard Model fermions in an anomaly-free manner and is shown to be viable with observed charged fermion masses and quark mixings. Constraints from flavour violations dictate the lower limit on the new physics scale in these types of frameworks. Through optimal flavour violation, it is shown that nearly two orders of magnitude improvement can be achieved on the lower limit, leading to the new physics scale $\ge 10^3$ TeV in this case. Further improvements are possible at the cost of the down quark mass deviating more than $3 \sigma$ from its value extracted from lattice calculations. Options for inducing tiny masses for light neutrinos are also discussed.

2024-06-27, **Laboratory constraint on the electric charge of the neutron and the neutrino**, Savely G. Karshenboim et.al., [2406.19129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19129v1)

 We revisit constraints on the electric charge of the neutron and neutrino as well as on e\_p+e\_e. We consider phenomenological constraints based on laboratory study of the electrical neutrality of subatomic, atomic, and molecular species under assumption of the conservation of the electric charge in the beta decay, that relates e\_p+e\_e, e\_n, and e\_nu. Some previously published constraints utilized an additional assumption e\_nu=0, which we do not. We dismiss a cosmological constraint at the level of 10^-35 e utilized by PDG in their Review of particle properties as a controversial one which makes the laboratory constraints on e\_nu dominant.   The phenomenological constraints from the laboratory experiments are obtained as e\_p+e\_e=(0.2\pm2.6)10^-21 e, e\_n=(-0.4\pm1.1)10^-21 e, and e\_nu=(0.6\pm3.2)10^{-21} e. The ones on e\_p+e\_e and e\_n are at the same level as the PDG constraints, while our e\_nu constraint is several orders of magnitude weaker than the controversial cosmological result dominated in the PDG constraint, but several orders of magnitude stronger than the other individual e\_nu constraints considered by PDG.   We also consider consistency of the phenomenological constraints and the SM. The SM ignores the neutrino mass term and cannot describe the neutrino oscillations which makes it not a complete theory but a part of it. We demonstrate that the condition of the cancellation of the triangle anomaly within the complete theory does not disagree with the phenomenological constraints since different extensions of the SM may produce different additional contributions to the anomaly. In particular, we consider a minimal extension of the SM, where leptons (nu,e) are treated the same ways as quarks, which sets e\_p+e\_e=0 and allows for numerical strengthening the constraint on e\_n and e\_nu, which is e\_n=-e\_nu=(-0.4\pm1.0)10^-21 e.

2024-06-27, **A Superfluid Dark Matter Cosmic String Wake**, Aline Favero et.al., [2406.19325v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19325v1)

 We study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the structure of a cosmic string wake, considering both the effects of regular and quantum pressure terms. We consider the total fluid to consist of a combination of baryons and dark matter. Hence, we are also able to study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the distribution of baryons inside the wake. We focus on parameter values for the superfluid dark matter which allow a MONDian explanation of galaxy rotation curves.

2024-06-27, **Interacting ultralight dark matter and dark energy and fits to cosmological data in a field theory approach**, Amin Aboubrahim et.al., [2406.19284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19284v1)

 The description of dark matter as a pressure-less fluid and of dark energy as a cosmological constant, both minimally coupled to gravity, constitutes the basis of the concordance $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model. However, the concordance model is based on using equations of motion directly for the fluids with constraints placed on their sources, and lacks an underlying Lagrangian. In this work, we propose a Lagrangian model of two spin zero fields describing dark energy and dark matter with an interaction term between the two along with self-interactions. We study the background evolution of the fields as well as their linear perturbations, suggesting an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM with dark matter and dark energy being fundamental dynamical fields. The parameters of the model are extracted using a Bayesian inference tool based on multiple cosmological data sets which include those of Planck (with lensing), BAO, Pantheon, SH0ES, and WiggleZ. Using these data, we set constraints on the dark matter mass and the interaction strengths. Furthermore, we find that the model is able to alleviate the Hubble tension for some data sets while also resolving the $S\_8$ tension.

2024-06-27, **Rotation curves velocities obtained by warm low-density plasma simulating dark halos and dark matter**, Y. Ben-Aryeh et.al., [2406.19218v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19218v1)

 The free electron model with Boltzmann statistics for spherical low-density plasmas is developed further with asymptotic relations obtaining the density of electrons, mass densities, and the potentials of such plasmas. Solutions are developed as function of a pure number proportional to the distance from the stellar plasma center (galaxy center) with extremely small coefficient, so that these solutions are essentially functions of large astronomical distances and masses. The present plasma is divided into a central part and very long tail, where the central part of the plasma shows an exponential dependence on the distance from the galaxy center, but a part of the large mass of this plasma is included in the long stellar plasma tail. The present model is specialized to completely ionized Hydrogen plasma (with a small correction factor considering its mixture with heavier atoms) where emission and absorption of spectral lines can be neglected in the warm low density stellar plasma. We apply the present approach for treating rotation curves measurements, A general theory for rotation curves should include the superposition of the gravitational potentials introduced by the high-density compact stars, with those of the low-density stellar plasma potentials. But for halos which are at extremely large distance from the galaxy center, the dominant effects would be those of dark matter, and such dark halos are permeating and surrounding the compact galactic stars. Such plasma is found to be transparent in most of the EM spectrum. The existence of a large mass for the warm low-density plasma may solve the problem of missing mass in rotation curves measurements.

2024-06-27, **Axion Detection Experiments Meet the Majoron**, Qiuyue Liang et.al., [2406.19083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19083v1)

 The majoron is a well-motivated light (pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone) boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of a global lepton-number symmetry. In this {\it letter}, we relate the spontaneous breaking scale and its soft-breaking mass by requiring that the majoron is the main component of the dark matter. An electromagnetic-anomalous coupling can be induced by minimally modifying the original majoron model, surprisingly, predicting a parameter region that largely overlaps with the QCD-axion dark matter band. Thus, we expect that axion search experiments meet the majoron.

2024-06-27, **A halo model approach to describe clustering and emission of the two main star forming galaxy populations for Cosmic Infrared Background studies**, Giorgia Zagatti et.al., [2406.19069v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19069v1)

 The Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB), traced by the emission from dusty star-forming galaxies, provides a crucial window into the phases of star formation throughout cosmic history. These galaxies, although challenging to detect individually at high redshifts due to their faintness, cumulatively contribute to the CIB which then becomes a powerful probe of galaxy formation, evolution and clustering. Here, we introduce a physically-motivated model for the CIB emission spanning a wide range of frequency and angular resolution, employing a halo model approach and distinguishing, within dark matter halos, between two main populations of star forming galaxies, i.e. normal late-type spiral and irregular galaxies and the progenitors of early-type galaxies. The emission from two galaxy populations maps into different regimes in frequency/resolution space, allowing us to constrain the clustering parameters of the model - $M\_{\text{min}}$, the mass of a halo with 50% probability of having a central galaxy and $\alpha$, the power law index regulating the number of satellite galaxies - through a fit to Planck and Herschel-SPIRE CIB anisotropy measurements. We find that, while being able to place constraints on some of the clustering parameters, the Planck frequency and multipole coverage cannot effectively disentangle the contributions from the two galaxy populations. On the other side, the Herschel-SPIRE measurements separate out and constrain the clustering of both populations. Our work, though, highlights an inconsistency of the results between the two datasets, partially already reported in other literature and still not understood.

2024-06-27, **Investigating a new neutral heavy gauge boson within the mono-Z$^{\prime}$ model via simulated pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV at the HL-LHC**, Ali Muhammad H. H. et.al., [2406.19004v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19004v1)

 In this study, we aim to explore the potential for generating events related to dark matter (DM) in conjunction with a neutral heavy gauge boson (Z$^{\prime}$) decaying leptonically during proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These collisions occur at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, with a high integrated luminosity equivalent to 1000 fb$^{-1}$. Our analysis involves interpreting the outcomes through Monte Carlo simulation of the effective field theory (EFT) framework. If no new physics is detected, we establish constraints on various parameters within the EFT context, such as the scenario cutoff scale ($\Lambda$) and the Z$^{\prime}$ mass.

2024-06-27, **Indirect Detection for Higgs Portal Majorana Fermionic Dark Matter**, Naoyuki Habaa et.al., [2406.18986v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18986v1)

 We study the $\gamma$-ray signal emitted from dark matter (DM) pair annihilation in the Higgs portal Majorana fermion DM model. In the model, a Majorana fermion DM $\chi$ couples with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field $H$ through a higher-dimensional term $-{\cal L}\supset H^\dagger H \bar{\chi}\chi/\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is a cutoff scale. The pair annihilation of $\chi$ through the above term produces the Higgs boson and the longitudinal modes of $W,Z$ gauge bosons. The Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs) are used as the most promising targets to search for the $\gamma$-ray signal of the model, due to high DM density and lack of astrophysical backgrounds. The {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope ({\it Fermi}-LAT) is used for the search, for its high sensitivity. In this work, we use 14-year {\it Fermi}-LAT data from 16 dSphs, to constrain the DM pair annihilation cross section for the DM mass range from 125 GeV to 100 TeV.

2024-06-27, **Attractive voids**, Raymond Isichei et.al., [2406.18979v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18979v1)

 We explore the well know mass deficit/surplus phenomenon in General Relativity to suggest that it could play a part in the dark matter conundrum. Specifically in collapses and condensations of matter associated with negative intrinsic curvature of the foliation associated with the asymptotic boundary conditions, the external (ADM) mass can vastly exceed the integrated local energy over the internal volume. This can be phrased in terms of a deficit of volume for a given surface area (with respect to zero curvature). We explore the phenomenon in the context of generalizations of the Oppenheimer-Snyder models and other "cut and paste" models, the Lemaitre-Bondi-Tolman metric and several others. We produce constructions where the internal object is contracting or expanding, has a life time different from the asymptotic Universe, as well as a volume different than the escavated volume from the Universe. These are purely relativistic constructions and they could play a role in the puzzle of dark matter: attraction without visible or indeed any matter.

2024-06-27, **Insights into Gravitinos Abundance, Cosmic Strings and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background**, K. El Bourakadi et.al., [2406.18828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18828v1)

 In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kahler potential. Our study reveals that this model can overcome the {\eta}-problem found in F-term models. Additionally, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Perturbation theory reveals that Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) evolve according to second-order effects arising from first-order curvature perturbations. In fact, the spectral energy density of these waves is particularly relevant to Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties. The dimensionless string tension significantly influences the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings post-inflation. Finally, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings is influenced by the energy scales of inflation and string formation.
