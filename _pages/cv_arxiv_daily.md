2025-09-16, **Smallness of neutrino masses and leptogenesis in 331 composite Higgs model**, Roman Nevzorov et.al., [2509.13245v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13245v1)

 We consider 331 composite Higgs model (CHM3) in which the Lagrangian of the strongly coupled sector is invariant with respect to global SU(3)\_C \times SU(3)\times U(1)\_6 symmetry that can originate from SU(6) subgroup of E\_6 and contains the gauge group of the standard model (SM) as a subgroup. The breakdown of the approximate SU(3)\times U(1)\_6 symmetry down to SU(2)\_W\times U(1)\_Y subgroup around the scale f\sim 10 TeV results in a set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs doublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is discussed. We argue that an approximate discrete Z\_2 symmetry may give rise to tiny masses of the left-handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with masses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the CHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the Higgs doublet and these composite fermions.

2025-09-16, **Probing Geometrical NSI at the DUNE experiment**, Riya Barick et.al., [2509.13205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13205v1)

 In this work, we investigate the implications of a novel non-standard interaction (NSI) of neutrinos. This interaction is geometric in origin -- it arises because the propagation of fermions in curved spacetime induces torsion. This torsion is non-propagating and can be eliminated from the action, resulting in a four-fermion interaction in a torsion-free background. The new interaction modifies the behaviour of the neutrinos passing through matter by introducing additional coupling terms, resulting in a new component in the effective potential. As a result, the neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter are altered. The relevant probabilities are computed using the Cayley-Hamilton formalism. We then explore the potential to probe these torsion-induced NSI in the proposed DUNE experiment. Constraints on the parameters characterizing the torsional effects are obtained. By selecting representative values of torsion parameters to which the DUNE experiment is sensitive, we analyse how these geometric interactions affect the experiment's sensitivity to determine neutrino mass hierarchy, the octant of the 2-3 leptonic mixing angle, and the CP phase. We also examine the new parameter degeneracies introduced by torsion effects and assess their impact on the overall sensitivities of DUNE. We find that the additional parameter degeneracies in the presence of torsion significantly affect the octant sensitivity.

2025-09-16, **Cogenesis of baryon and lepton number asymmetries matching the EMPRESS Data**, Kyu Jung Bae et.al., [2509.13098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13098v1)

 We show that a simple supersymmetric $U(1)\_{B-L}$ extension of the standard model can explain simultaneously the large electron neutrino asymmetry hinted by the recent EMPRESS data as well as the observed tiny baryon number asymmetry via the resonant leptogenesis mechanism. The condensation of $B-L$ Higgs dominating the universe at its decay is the sole source for these generation processes. Here, the infrequent decays of the $B-L$ Higgs to heavy right handed neutrinos and successive prompt decays of these right handed neutrinos around the electroweak phase transition produce the observed baryon number asymmetry, while the complete decay of the same $B-L$ Higgs at a later epoch leads to a large lepton number asymmetry. The right amounts of both asymmetries are found to be obtained for the symmetry-breaking scale $v\_\phi \sim 10^{10}~{\rm GeV}$. Moreover, in a close connection to the positivity of both asymmetries, seemingly only the normal mass hierarchy of light neutrino species works. Finally, the gravitational wave background from the topologically stable strong type-I cosmic strings, generated from the breaking of $U(1)\_{B-L}$ symmetry, can be within the reach of future experiments such as ultimate DECIGO.

2025-09-16, **Physics potential of the IceCube Upgrade for atmospheric neutrino oscillations**, IceCube Collaboration et.al., [2509.13066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13066v1)

 The IceCube Upgrade is an extension of the existing IceCube Neutrino Observatory and will be deployed in the 2025-2026 austral summer. It will significantly improve the sensitivity of the detector to atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The existing 86-string IceCube array contains a dense in-fill known as DeepCore which is optimized to measure neutrinos with energies down to a few GeV. The IceCube Upgrade will consist of seven new densely-instrumented strings placed within the DeepCore volume to further enhance the performance in the GeV energy range. The additional strings will feature new optical modules, each containing multiple PMTs, in contrast to the existing modules that each contain a single PMT. This will more than triple the number of PMT channels with respect to the current IceCube configuration, allowing for improved detection efficiency and reconstruction performance at GeV energies. We describe necessary updates to simulation, event selection, and reconstruction to accommodate the higher data rates observed by the upgraded detector and the addition of multi-PMT modules. We determine the expected sensitivity of the IceCube Upgrade to the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters sin$^2\theta\_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2\_{32}$, the appearance of tau neutrinos and the neutrino mass ordering. The IceCube Upgrade will provide neutrino oscillation measurements that are of similar precision to those from accelerator experiments, while providing complementarity by probing higher energies and longer baselines, and with different sources of systematic uncertainties.

2025-09-16, **Radio detection of Cosmic Rays with the IceCube Surface Array Enhancement**, Megha Venugopal et.al., [2509.13033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13033v1)

 The surface array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, IceTop, measures cosmic rays in the PeV-EeV primary energy range. Stations comprising radio antennas and scintillation detectors will be added to enhance the existing surface detectors. A prototype station, consisting of eight scintillation detectors and three radio antennas, has been in operation in with the instrumentation in final design since the beginning of 2023. Radio signals from air showers are measured by antennas that are read-out when the trigger condition from the scintillation detectors is met. This contribution reports on air-shower coincidence measurements of these radio antennas with IceTop. Geometric shower parameters reconstructed from the radio antennas are compared with those from IceTop to determine the angular resolution. We also present details on the two new stations that were tested, deployed and commissioned with their respective data acquisition systems during the latest field season at the South Pole.

2025-09-16, **Archival Search for IceCube Sub-TeV Neutrino Counterparts to Sub-Threshold Gravitational Wave Events from the Third Observing Run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA**, Tista Mukherjee et.al., [2509.13003v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13003v1)

 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory actively participates in multimessenger follow-ups of gravitational-wave (GW) events. With the release of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue (GWTC)-2.1 and -3, the sub-threshold GW event information from the third observation run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors is publicly available. These sub-threshold GWs are identified via template-based and minimally modelled search pipelines. Neutrino counterparts can enhance their astrophysical significance and improve their localisation. In this contribution, we propose a catalogue-based search for sub-TeV neutrino counterparts to sub-threshold GWs. For this search, we use archival data from IceCube's dense infill array, DeepCore. Using the unbinned maximum likelihood method, we search for correlation between IceCube sub-TeV neutrinos and the $\sim$ 100 most significant sub-threshold GW source candidates. With this study, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts to identify common astrophysical sources of neutrinos and GWs. We present the current status of this search and its role in advancing multimessenger astronomy, paving the way for deeper exploration of GW events and their sources.

2025-09-16, **Muon number reconstruction with IceTop using a two-component lateral distribution function**, Mark Weyrauch et.al., [2509.13002v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13002v1)

 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, situated at the geographic South Pole, comprises both a surface component, IceTop, and a deep in-ice component. This unique setup allows for simultaneous measurements of low-energy ($\sim \rm{GeV}$) and high-energy ($\gtrsim 400\,\rm{GeV}$) muons generated in cosmic-ray air showers. The correlation between these low- and high-energy muons can serve as a valuable tool not only for analyzing cosmic-ray composition but also for tests of hadronic interaction models. However, IceTop does not feature dedicated muon detectors, making it challenging to measure the low-energy muon component for individual air showers. \\ \noindent For this reason, a two-component lateral distribution function is utilized for the simultaneous reconstruction of the primary energy and low-energy muon number on a single-event basis. This is achieved by combining analytical descriptions of the electromagnetic and muon lateral distributions. In this work, the underlying principles of this method will be discussed, as well as its capability for muon number reconstruction using the hadronic interaction models Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC.

2025-09-16, **Investigating the capability of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory to detect gamma-ray emission from simulated stationary neutrino sources identified by KM3NeT**, Gloria Maria Cicciari et.al., [2509.12910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12910v1)

 The simultaneous observation of gamma rays and neutrinos from the same astrophysical source offers a unique opportunity to probe particle acceleration and interaction mechanisms in ultra-high-energy environments. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray facility, sensitive to energies from 20~GeV to 300~TeV. In this work, we present for the first time a performance study of CTAO based on joint simulations of steady-state sources emitting both neutrinos and gamma rays, under the assumption that neutrino events are detected by the KM3NeT telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. To identify potentially observable sources, we apply a neutrino-based selection filter according to KM3NeT's discovery potential. We then simulate gamma-ray detectability with CTAO, taking into account visibility, sensitivity, and extragalactic background light absorption. The analysis is specifically focused on exploring the detectability of sources at low neutrino luminosities, limited to values below $10^{52}\,\mathrm{erg\,yr^{-1}}$, in order to assess the performance of CTAO and KM3NeT in identifying faint extragalactic emitters. Particular attention is given to the strategic role of KM3NeT's geographic location, which provides access to Southern-sky sources, and to the impact of the planned CTA+ upgrade, which will enhance CTAO-South with Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs). Our results highlight the importance of coordinated multi-messenger strategies between KM3NeT and CTAO to maximize the discovery potential of astrophysical neutrino sources.

2025-09-16, **One-loop Renormalization of the Type-I Seesaw Model in the On-shell Scheme**, Jihong Huang et.al., [2509.12844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12844v1)

 In a previous paper arxiv:2507.21691, we have carried out one-loop renormalization of the type-I seesaw model in the modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\rm MS}$) scheme. In the present one, we continue to renormalize the type-I seesaw model in the on-shell scheme. Such an investigation is mainly motivated by the fact that the on-shell scheme has been widely adopted in the renormalization of the standard electroweak theory and implemented for its precision tests. We first specify the physical parameters in the on-shell scheme, and then fix the corresponding counterterms through on-shell renormalization conditions. In the presence of massive Majorana neutrinos, we propose a practical method to determine gauge-independent counterterms for the lepton flavor mixing matrix. With the explicit counterterms in both the $\overline{\rm MS}$ and on-shell schemes, we establish the matching relations of the electric charge, physical masses and flavor mixing matrix elements between these two schemes. Our results in the present and previous papers lay the foundation for precision calculations in the type-I seesaw model.

2025-09-16, **Extreme High-Energy Neutrinos: IceCube vs. KM3NeT**, Lu Lu et.al., [2509.12628v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12628v1)

 We review the state of the art in the detection of extreme high-energy neutrinos, focusing on the IceCube and KM3NeT neutrino telescopes. IceCube, operating deep in Antarctic ice, and KM3NeT, a new array in the Mediterranean Sea, employ distinct designs to capture Cherenkov light from neutrino interactions. We examine their detector architectures, readout and reconstruction performance for PeV-scale and higher-energy neutrinos. Recent candidate events above 5 PeV are highlighted. These include a ~120 PeV muon track observed by KM3NeT in 2023, and IceCube's highest-energy detections, which comprise several-PeV showers and tracks. We outline current approaches to neutrino energy reconstruction and explore scenarios that might explain the apparent differences in observed event characteristics. Finally, we summarize future prospects for extreme-energy neutrino observations and their implications for astrophysical source populations and cosmogenic neutrinos.

2025-09-15, **Observing Double Higgs Production at the LHC via Neutrino Feature Engineering in $hh\to b\bar{b}\ell\ellνν$**, Alexandre Alves et.al., [2509.12450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12450v1)

 Double Higgs production is challenging even at the High Luminosity LHC. The Standard Model (SM) $hh\to b\bar{b}WW(ZZ)\to b\bar{b}\ell\ell\nu\nu$ has a moderate cross section compared to other decay modes, but its backgrounds, mainly top quark pairs and Drell-Yan production, are overwhelming. In this work, we propose new kinematic features designed to improve the discrimination of double Higgs pairs, in the $b\bar{b}\ell\ell\nu\nu$ channel, with cut-based and multivariate analyses. The new features are built with the neutrinos' momenta solutions obtained from imposing mass constraints when calculating Higgsness and Topness variables. For the SM $hh$ production, we estimate a $3.7\sigma$ statistical significance from an optimized cut-based strategy, improving about 20% over the best estimates of the literature, and $5\sigma$ from a multivariate analysis if systematic uncertainties on the backgrounds are small. The new variables are constructed as ratios of kinematic functions of the particles' momenta, being less prone to systematic errors. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the solutions in reconstructing heavy scalar resonances and other variables of phenomenological importance.

2025-09-15, **Leptogenesis from Dark Matter Coannihilation**, Simran Arora et.al., [2509.12333v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12333v1)

 We propose a minimal extension of the type-I seesaw model to realise leptogenesis from the co-annihilation of dark sector particles. The type-I seesaw model is extended with a singlet fermion and two singlet scalars charged under a $Z\_{2}$ symmetry. The $Z\_{2}$-odd singlet scalar is the dark matter candidate. Here the usual type-I seesaw mechanism generates neutrino mass, and a net lepton asymmetry is generated from the co-annihilation of the dark matter and the $Z\_2$-odd singlet fermion. The $Z\_{2}$-even singlet scalar is important in dark matter phenomenology. Successful leptogenesis is possible at TeV-scale, unlike the vanilla case. This minimal extension provides an elegant explanation of successful leptogenesis with direct connection to the dark matter abundance in the Universe.

2025-09-15, **New constraints on $Z^\prime$ from captured dark matter annihilation in astrophysical objects**, Basabendu Barman et.al., [2509.12192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12192v1)

 Considering dark matter capture in astrophysical objects such as neutron stars and brown dwarfs, followed by their annihilation into two neutrino and four neutrino final states, we derive new constraints on the mass and coupling of a novel abelian gauge boson $Z^\prime$ arising from an anomaly-free $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model. We further confront these astrophysical limits with complementary bounds from the Planck-observed relic abundance via the freeze-in mechanism, big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), gravitational wave signatures from cosmic strings, and searches at energy and intensity frontier experiments.

2025-09-15, **DeepMET: Improving missing transverse momentum estimation with a deep neural network**, CMS Collaboration et.al., [2509.12012v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12012v1)

 At hadron colliders, the net transverse momentum of particles that do not interact with the detector (missing transverse momentum, $\vec{p}\_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$) is a crucial observable in many analyses. In the standard model, $\vec{p}\_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ originates from neutrinos. Many beyond-the-standard-model particles, such as dark matter candidates, are also expected to leave the experimental apparatus undetected. This paper presents a novel $\vec{p}\_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ estimator, DeepMET, which is based on deep neural networks that were developed by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC. The DeepMET algorithm produces a weight for each reconstructed particle based on its properties. The estimator is based on the negative vector sum of the weighted transverse momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Compared with other estimators currently employed by CMS, DeepMET improves the $\vec{p}\_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ resolution by 10$-$30%, shows improvement for a wide range of final states, is easier to train, and is more resilient against the effects of additional proton-proton interactions accompanying the collision of interest.

2025-09-15, **Search for Neutrino Counterparts to Gravitational Wave Events in Super-Kamiokande during the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA O4 Observing Run**, L. N . Machado et.al., [2509.12002v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12002v1)

 In recent years, the Super-Kamiokande (SK) experiment has contributed to multi-messenger astronomy by searching for neutrino signals in coincidence with gravitational wave events. The fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaborations started in May 2023. During the initial phase, known as O4a, LIGO identified 81 gravitational wave candidates. Neutrino follow-up searches with O4a were performed in SK. While no significant signal was observed, flux limits were computed.

2025-09-16, **Constraints on Dark Matter Structures around Gaia Black Holes**, Nuno P. Branco et.al., [2509.13319v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13319v1)

 We demonstrate that Gaia's detection of stars on wide orbits around black holes opens a new observational window on dark matter structures -- such as scalar clouds and dark matter spikes -- predicted in a range of theoretical scenarios. Using precise radial velocity measurements of these systems, we derive state-of-the-art constraints on dark matter density profiles and particle masses in previously unexplored regions of parameter space. We also test the black hole hypothesis against the alternative of a boson star composed of light scalar fields.

2025-09-16, **Revisiting axion dark matter with nonlinear transitions**, Max Miyazaki et.al., [2509.13292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13292v1)

 Recently, two of the present authors showed that even when the axion momentum is much smaller than its mass, the axion can still behave like radiation if its energy density greatly exceeds the maximum potential energy set by the cosine-type potential. As the energy density redshifts down to the potential scale, a nonlinear transition occurs, during which the axion's adiabatic invariant is not conserved. In this paper, we revisit the analysis of axion dark matter by incorporating the effects of this nonlinear transition through a precise study of the axion spectrum. We demonstrate that in the parameter region with a relatively small decay constant, often favored in axion search experiments, special care is required when estimating the axion abundance and spectrum. We also highlight a scenario in which axions are produced through the stimulated decay of a modulus, a situation that may naturally arise in the string axiverse, where the nonlinear transition occurs across a wide parameter region. Furthermore, we discuss related phenomena, including QCD axion dark matter, the formation of axion clumps such as miniclusters and axion stars, gravitational wave production, and formation of primordial black holes as dark matter.

2025-09-16, **Parity in Composite-Field Galaxy Correlators**, Zucheng Gao et.al., [2509.13207v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13207v1)

 Detecting parity violation on cosmological scales would provide a striking clue to new physics. Large-scale structure offers the raw statistical power -- many three-dimensional modes -- to make such tests. However, for scalar observables, like galaxy clustering, the leading parity-sensitive observable is the trispectrum, whose high dimensionality makes the measurement and noise estimation challenging. We present two late-time parity-odd kurto spectra that compress the parity-odd scalar trispectrum into one-dimensional, power-spectrum-like observables. They are built by correlating (i) two appropriately weighted quadratic composite fields, or (ii) a linear and cubic composite field, constructed from dark matter (DM) or galaxy overdensity fields. We develop an FFTLog pipeline for efficient theoretical predictions of the two observables. We then validate the estimators for a specific parity-odd primordial template on perturbative DM field, and on DM and halo fields in full N-body \texttt{Quijote} simulations, with and without parity-odd initial conditions, in real and redshift space. For DM, the variance is dominated by the parity-even contribution -- i.e., the gravitationally induced parity-even trispectrum -- and is efficiently suppressed by phase-matched fiducial subtraction. For halos, discreteness-driven stochasticity dominates and is not appreciably reduced by subtraction; however, optimal weighting and halo-matter cross kurto spectra considerably mitigate this noise and enhance the signal. Using controlled down-sampling of the matter field, we empirically calibrate how the parity-even variance scales with number density and volume, and provide an illustrative forecast for the detectability of parity-odd kurto spectra in a Euclid-like spectroscopic galaxy survey.

2025-09-16, **Euclid preparation. Using mock Low Surface Brightness dwarf galaxies to probe Wide Survey detection capabilities**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2509.13163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13163v1)

 Local Universe dwarf galaxies are both cosmological and mass assembly probes. Deep surveys have enabled the study of these objects down to the low surface brightness (LSB) regime. In this paper, we estimate Euclid's dwarf detection capabilities as well as limits of its MERge processing function (MER pipeline), responsible for producing the stacked mosaics and final catalogues. To do this, we inject mock dwarf galaxies in a real Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) field in the VIS band and compare the input catalogue to the final MER catalogue. The mock dwarf galaxies are generated with simple S\'ersic models and structural parameters extracted from observed dwarf galaxy property catalogues. To characterize the detected dwarfs, we use the mean surface brightness inside the effective radius SBe (in mag arcsec-2). The final MER catalogues achieve completenesses of 91 % for SBe in [21, 24], and 54 % for SBe in [24, 28]. These numbers do not take into account possible contaminants, including confusion with background galaxies at the location of the dwarfs. After taking into account those effects, they become respectively 86 % and 38 %. The MER pipeline performs a final local background subtraction with small mesh size, leading to a flux loss for galaxies with Re > 10". By using the final MER mosaics and reinjecting this local background, we obtain an image in which we recover reliable photometric properties for objects under the arcminute scale. This background-reinjected product is thus suitable for the study of Local Universe dwarf galaxies. Euclid's data reduction pipeline serves as a test bed for other deep surveys, particularly regarding background subtraction methods, a key issue in LSB science.

2025-09-16, **Probing the millisecond pulsar origin of the GeV excess in the Galactic Centre with LISA**, Valeriya Korol et.al., [2509.12998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12998v1)

 The GeV $\gamma$-ray excess observed towards the Galactic Centre remains unexplained. While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading interpretation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of millisecond pulsars has not been ruled out. Testing this hypothesis with electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are strongly affected by scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge.   We construct synthetic populations of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario, in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only $10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA. Nevertheless, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses ($\sim$0.4 M$\_\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions ($\sim$0.9 M$\_\odot$).   LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems. Distinguishing millisecond pulsar binaries from the far more numerous double white dwarfs will be challenging, though LISA detections could provide valuable targets for follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array, enabling a critical test of the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\gamma$-ray excess.

2025-09-16, **Evolution of low surface brightness ultra-thin galaxies: The role of dark matter halo and bar formation on disk thickness**, K. Aditya et.al., [2509.12966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12966v1)

 We investigate how stellar disks sustain their ultrathin structure throughout their evolution. We follow the evolution of ultrathin stellar disks with varying dark matter (DM) halo concentration ($c$) using collisionless $N$-body simulations with \texttt{AREPO}. We test models embedded in steep ($c = 12$), shallow ($c = 2$), and intermediate ($c = 6$) DM concentrations. Our models match the observed structural properties of the stellar disk in the low surface brightness (LSB) ultrathin galaxy FGC~2366, specifically its surface brightness, disk scalelength, and vertical thinness ($h\_{z}/R\_{D} = 0.1$), while excluding gas, allowing us to isolate the effects of DM. The internal disk heating mechanism driven by bars is suppressed in the LSB ultrathin stellar disks regardless of the DM concentration. The ratio of disk thickness ($h\_z$) to scalelength ($R\_D$) remains constant at $\leq 0.1$ throughout their evolution. To clearly establish that the LSB nature of stellar disks is the key to preventing disk thickening, we construct the initial conditions by increasing the stellar mass fraction from $f\_{s} \sim 0.01$ to $0.02$ and $0.04$, respectively, while keeping the total mass equal to $10^{11} M\_\odot$ and $h\_z/R\_D \leq 0.1$ unchanged. We find that models with a higher stellar mass fraction embedded in a shallow DM potential ($c = 2$) form bars and undergo significant disk thickening ($h\_{z}/R\_{D} \gg 0.1$) concurrent with the bar growth. We conclude that if the LSB disks are thin to begin with, they remain so throughout their evolution in isolation, regardless of the concentration of the DM halo.

2025-09-16, **Electric Dipole Moments from Axion-Like Particle Dark Matter Background**, Jason L. Evans et.al., [2509.12869v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12869v1)

 New one- and two-loop contributions to the lepton's and nucleon's EDM, which are induced by an axion-like particle dark matter background, are examined. These contributions include effects from CP-violating ALP interactions with photons, leptons and nucleons. The contribution to the EDM is so larger it leads to new constraints on the CP violating couplings of axion-like particles, if the axion-like particle mass is smaller than $10^{-11} $ eV.

2025-09-16, **Revisiting thermodynamics at the outskirts of the Perseus cluster with Suzaku: importance of modeling the Hot Galactic gas**, Kyoko Matsushita et.al., [2509.12624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12624v1)

 The thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) at the outskirts of galaxy clusters provide valuable insights into the growth of the dark matter halo and the heating of the ICM. Considering the results of the soft X-ray background study of non-cluster Suzaku fields, we revisit 65 Suzaku pointing observations of the Perseus cluster in eight azimuthal directions beyond 1 Mpc (0.8 $r\_{500}$). A possible foreground component, whose spectrum is modeled as a 1 keV collisional ionization equilibrium plasma, significantly affects the temperature and density measurements of the ICM in cluster outskirts. The emission measures in the six arms are similar, showing that the radial slopes of temperature and density follow $r^{-0.67\pm0.25}$ and $r^{-2.21\pm 0.06}$, respectively. The radial pressure profile is close to the average profile measured by the Planck satellite. The resulting entropy slope is $\propto r^{0.81\pm 0.25}$, consistent with the theoretical slope of 1.1. The integrated gas fraction, the ratio of the integrated gas mass to the hydrostatic mass, is estimated to be 0.13$\pm$0.01 and 0.18$\pm$0.02 at $r\_{500}$ and $r\_{200}$, respectively, consistent with the cosmic baryon fraction. These results suggest that the ICM at the cluster outskirts is quite regular and close to hydrostatic equilibrium. The remaining two arms show that the emission measure is higher by a factor of 1.5-2, possibly due to accretion from filaments from the large-scale structure. A sudden drop in the emission measure also occurs in a direction toward one of the filaments.

2025-09-15, **Searching for leptophilic composite asymmetric dark sector at $e^+e^-$ colliders**, Chih-Ting Lu et.al., [2509.12504v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12504v1)

 Composite asymmetric dark matter (ADM) models provide a well-motivated paradigm that simultaneously explains dark matter (DM) relic density and matter-antimatter asymmetry. In these models, the mass of the DM candidate (the lightest dark baryon) is generated through the dark confinement scale dynamics. Although the leptophilic composite ADM model offers a viable framework, comprehensive studies of its collider phenomenology are absent. This work systematically explores novel signatures from leptophilic composite asymmetric dark sector at both low-energy and high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders as well as other existing collider constraints. We demonstrate detectability of TeV-scale mediators along with sub-GeV to GeV-scale lightest dark mesons at Belle II and its proposed far detector, GAZELLE, as well as CEPC experiments. Moreover, these experiments exhibit complementary coverage of the model parameter space.

2025-09-15, **Regular Black Holes from Proper-Time flow in Quantum Gravity and their Quasinormal modes, Shadow and Hawking radiation**, Alfio Bonanno et.al., [2509.12469v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12469v1)

 We derive a class of regular black holes from the proper-time renormalization group approach to asymptotically safe gravity. A central challenge is the robustness of physical predictions to the regularization scheme. We address this by computing key observables for our quantum-corrected black holes, which are non-singular and asymptotically Schwarzschild. We calculate the quasinormal mode spectrum, finding significant deviations from the classical case. The Hawking radiation spectrum is strongly suppressed, implying a slower evaporation rate and relaxed constraints on primordial black holes as dark matter. Shadows and ISCO radii remain consistent with observations. Our results demonstrate that the singularity resolution and its primary observational implications are robust physical outcomes.

2025-09-15, **Towards a theory of dissipative Dark Matter I: the Born limit**, Garance Lankester--Broche et.al., [2509.12317v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12317v1)

 We derive the energy-differential cross section and energy loss rate for dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM) models within the Born regime using perturbative quantum field theory. Six dissipative scenarios are considered, incorporating the emission of particles that may be either massless or possess a kinematically allowed light mass. Both short-range and long-range force-mediated dSIDM interactions are examined. In the non-relativistic regime we obtain closed-form expressions of the energy-differential cross sections by a controlled expansion in the initial relative dark matter velocity. Up to trivial factors, the leading-order squared emission amplitude is model-independent for massless emissions. Model dependence arises for massive particle emission and at the next-to-leading order. The latter reduces to three distinct cases. The derived analytical expressions for dipole and quadrupole emission exhibit excellent agreement with numerical computations, providing simple, ready-to-use formulas. These expressions are benchmarked against full numerical results to confirm their accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of these processes in the soft emission limit. Our results show that additional corrections are necessary when applying factorization to ensure consistency between the soft energy-differential cross section and the full counterparts across a broad energy range. Finally, we investigate the regime of perturbative validity in terms of the model parameters, identifying the conditions under which our results are applicable.

2025-09-15, **DELVE Milky Way Satellite Census I: Satellite Population and Survey Selection Function**, C. Y. Tan et.al., [2509.12313v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12313v1)

 The properties of Milky Way satellite galaxies have important implications for galaxy formation, reionization, and the fundamental physics of dark matter. However, the population of Milky Way satellites includes the faintest known galaxies, and current observations are incomplete. To understand the impact of observational selection effects on the known satellite population, we perform rigorous, quantitative estimates of the Milky Way satellite galaxy detection efficiency in three wide-field survey datasets: the Dark Energy Survey Year 6, the DECam Local Volume Exploration Data Release 3, and the Pan-STARRS1 Data Release 1. Together, these surveys cover $\sim$13,600 deg$^2$ to $g \sim 24.0$ and $\sim$27,700 deg$^2$ to $g \sim 22.5$, spanning $\sim$91% of the high-Galactic-latitude sky ($\|b\| \geq 15^\circ$). We apply multiple detection algorithms over the combined footprint and recover 49 known satellites above a strict census detection threshold. To characterize the sensitivity of our census, we run our detection algorithms on a large set of simulated galaxies injected into the survey data, which allows us to develop models that predict the detectability of satellites as a function of their properties. We then fit an empirical model to our data and infer the luminosity function, radial distribution, and size-luminosity relation of Milky Way satellite galaxies. Our empirical model predicts a total of $265^{+79}\_{-47}$ satellite galaxies with $-20 \leq M\_V \leq 0$, half-light radii of $15 \leq r\_{1/2} (\rm pc) \leq 3000$, and galactocentric distances of $10 \leq D\_{\rm GC} (\rm kpc) \leq 300$. We also identify a mild anisotropy in the angular distribution of the observed galaxies, at a significance of $\sim$$2\sigma$, which can be attributed to the clustering of satellites associated with the LMC.

 We use a cavity optomechanical accelerometer to perform a resonant search for ultralight dark matter at acoustic frequencies near 39 kHz (a particle mass of $0.16$ neV/$c^2$). The accelerometer is based on a Si$\_3$N$\_4$ membrane, cryogenically cooled to 4 K, with photothermal heating employed to scan the resonance frequency by $10^2$ detector linewidths. Leveraging shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation pressure feedback cooling, we realize an acceleration resolution of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g\_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over a bandwidth of $30$ Hz near the fundamental test mass resonance. We find no evidence of a dark matter signal and infer an upper bound on the coupling to normal matter that is several orders of magnitude above the stringent bounds set by equivalence principle experiments. We outline a path toward novel dark matter constraints in future experiments by exploiting arrays of mass-loaded optomechanical sensors at lower temperature probed with distributed squeezed light.

 The current cosmological model, known as the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model (or $\Lambda$CDM for short) is one of the most astonishing accomplishments of contemporary theoretical physics. It is a well-defined mathematical model which depends on very few ingredients and parameters and is able to make a range of predictions and postdictions with astonishing accuracy. It is built out of well-known physics - general relativity, quantum mechanics and atomic physics, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics - and predicts the existence of new, unseen components. Again and again it has been shown to fit new data sets with remarkable precision. Despite these successes, we have yet to understand the unseen components of the Universe and there has been evidence for inconsistencies in the model. In these lectures, we lay the foundations of modern cosmology.

2025-09-15, **Gravitational Signatures of Axion Dark Matter via Parity-Violating Interactions**, Marco Figliolia et.al., [2509.12038v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12038v1)

 We investigate axion-like particles coupled to gravity through a parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) interaction. In this framework, axion dark matter (DM) can decay into pairs of circularly polarized gravitons, producing a persistent, nearly monochromatic GW signal. We compute the expected signal at Earth assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White Galactic halo model with the corresponding velocity distribution, and compare it with the narrowband sensitivities of the LIGO O4 run and the projected reach of the Einstein Telescope. The resulting bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological stability requirement for axion masses $m\_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit. This constitutes a robust direct terrestrial constraint on the axion-gravity CS coupling. We also discuss distinctive observational signatures, such as circular polarization asymmetries, annual modulation, and potential enhancements from DM substructures, which could serve as smoking-gun evidence for parity-violating gravitational interactions.

2025-09-15, **Dark Parton Shower Effects for Cosmic Ray Boosted Dark Matter**, Zirong Chen et.al., [2509.12007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12007v1)

 We investigate the dark parton shower effects in the direct detection of cosmic-ray boosted dark matter (CRDM), focusing on a dark photon-mediated model with fermionic dark matter-electron interactions. Utilizing a Monte Carlo framework to incorporate the Sudakov form factors and kinematic dipole recoil schemes, we simulate the CRDM energy spectrum evolution under the dark sector splitting. Our results reveal a significant energy-dependent modification of the CRDM flux. For a 1 keV dark matter (DM) mass and a coupling of $g\_D=3$, the CRDM flux can be enhanced by a factor up to 1.12 in the $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2} \sim 1)$ MeV energy range for $2m\_\chi \lesssim m\_{A^\prime} \lesssim 10^{-2}$ MeV, while it is suppressed by more than $50\%$ at energy around 100 MeV for $m\_{A^\prime} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ MeV. We then translate these effects into the experimental sensitivities for PandaX-4T, Super-Kamiokande, and JUNO. At $m\_{A^\prime} = 10^{-3}$ MeV and $g\_D=3$, the bounds on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon^2$ are relaxed by factors of 1.02, 1.6 and 1.4, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that the parameter space considered is consistent with those astrophysical constraints on dark matter self-interactions from observations of the Bullet Cluster.

2025-09-15, **Enhanced Cosmic-Ray Cooling in AGN from Dark Matter Deep Inelastic Scattering**, Linjie Li et.al., [2509.11906v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11906v1)

 The diffusion of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs) through the dark matter (DM) spikes of active galactic nuclei entails significant energy loss via interactions with DM. While previous studies of sub-GeV DM have focused on elastic scattering, this process becomes insufficient at higher proton energies and DM masses. In this work, we investigate the CR-DM deep inelastic scattering (DIS) as mediated by a vector portal. We calculate the DIS contribution to the CR energy loss rate and derive stringent exclusion limits on the CR-DM scattering cross-section for DM masses between $10^{-6}$ GeV and $1$ GeV. For higher CR energies and mediator masses, the resulting CR cooling timescales are reduced by orders of magnitude after involving the DIS contribution, producing stringent constraints that surpass most of current experimental limits.

2025-09-15, **Testing CCC+TL Cosmology with Galaxy Rotation Curves**, Rajendra P. Gupta et.al., [2509.11896v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11896v1)

 This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the Universe's expansion and Zwicky's tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that the CCC parameter {\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark matter and dark energy, which we call {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy, and is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically {\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe, e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions, one expects {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database and find the results promising.

2025-09-15, **Letter of Intent: AICE - 100m Atom Interferometer Experiment at CERN**, Charles Baynham et.al., [2509.11867v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11867v2)

 We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment - AICE - to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the AICE detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to AICE.

2025-09-15, **Precise Measurement of the Absolute Sky Brightness at 60 to 350 MHz**, Luke McKay et.al., [2509.11846v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11846v1)

 Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.

2025-09-15, **Investigating the correlations of bulk properties of hyperon star with dark matter**, Rashmita Jena et.al., [2509.11758v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11758v1)

 The strong gravitational pull of the neutron star leads to the accretion of dark matter (DM) inside the core of the neutron star. The accretion of DM affects the bulk properties of the neutron star. Here, we study how the accretion of WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) dark matter particles affects the $\Delta-$admixed hyperon star's bulk properties specifically mass, radius, tidal deformability, $f-$mode frequency and moment of inertia. The inclusion of dark matter softens the EOS (equation of state) and reduces the maximum possible mass, canonical radius, canonical tidal deformability, and moment of inertia of canonical star. However, the $f-$mode frequency of the canonical star increases. We find a cubical correlation between the dark matter fermi momenta $k\_f^{DM}$ and bulk properties of canonical star.

 We study magnetic conversion of ultra-relativistic axion-like particles (ALPs) into photons in compact-star environments, focusing on the hot, transient conditions of core-collapse supernova (SN) remnants and neutron-star mergers (NSMs). We address previously overlooked uncertainties, particularly the suppression caused by ejected matter near the stellar surface, a region crucial to the conversion process. We derive analytical expressions for the transition rate; they reveal the influence of key parameters and their uncertainties. We update constraints using historical gamma-ray data from SN~1987A and find $g\_{a\gamma}<5\times10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for $m\_a\lesssim10^{-9}$ meV. We also forecast sensitivities for a future Galactic SN and for NSMs, assuming observations with Fermi-LAT or similar gamma-ray instruments. We distinguish ALPs -- defined as coupling only to photons and produced via Primakoff scattering -- from axions, which also couple to nucleons and emerge through nuclear bremsstrahlung. We omit pionic axion production due to its large uncertainties and inconsistencies, though it could contribute comparably to bremsstrahlung under optimistic assumptions. For the compact sources, we adopt time-averaged one-zone models, guided by numerical simulations, to enable clear and reproducible parametric studies.

2025-09-16, **How Theory-Informed Priors Affect DESI Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy**, Michael W. Toomey et.al., [2509.13318v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13318v1)

 Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have been interpreted to suggest that dark energy may be evolving. In this work, we examine how prior choices affect such conclusions. Specifically, we study the biases introduced by the customary use of uniform priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters, $w\_0$ and $w\_a$, when assessing evidence for evolving dark energy. To do so, we construct theory-informed priors on $(w\_0, w\_a)$ using a normalizing flow (NF), trained on two representative quintessence models, which learns the distribution of these parameters conditional on the underlying $\Lambda$CDM parameters. In the combined $\textit{Planck}$ CMB + DESI BAO analysis we find that the apparent tension with a cosmological constant in the CPL framework can be reduced from $\sim 3.1\sigma$ to $\sim 1.3\sigma$ once theory-informed priors are applied, rendering the result effectively consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. For completeness, we also analyze combinations that include Type Ia supernova data, showing similar shifts toward the $\Lambda$CDM limit. Taken together, the observed sensitivity to prior choices in these analyses arises because uniform priors - often mischaracterized as "uninformative" - can actually bias inferences toward unphysical parameter regions. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of adopting physically motivated priors to ensure robust cosmological inferences, especially when evaluating new hypotheses with only marginal statistical support. Lastly, our NF-based framework achieves these results by post-processing existing MCMC chains, requiring $\approx 1$ hour of additional CPU compute time on top of the base analysis - a dramatic speedup over direct model sampling that highlights the scalability of this approach for testing diverse theoretical models.

2025-09-16, **Short-Duration Gravitational Wave Burst Detection using Convolutional Neural Network**, Matteo Pracchia et.al., [2509.13241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13241v1)

 Detecting unmodeled gravitational wave (GW) bursts presents significant challenges due to the lack of accurate waveform templates required for matched-filtering techniques. A primary difficulty lies in distinguishing genuine signals from transient noise. Machine learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer promising alternatives for this classification problem. This paper presents a CNN-based pipeline for detecting short GW bursts (duration $< 10~\mathrm{s}$), adapted from an existing framework designed for longer-duration events. The CNN has been trained on core-collapse supernova (CCSN) gravitational waveform models injected into simulated Gaussian noise. The network successfully identifies these signals and generalizes to CCSN waveforms not included in the training set, showing the potential of U-Net architectures for detecting short-duration gravitational wave transients across diverse astrophysical scenarios.

2025-09-16, **Dynamic or Systematic? Bayesian model selection between dark energy and supernova biases**, A. N. Ormondroyd et.al., [2509.13220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13220v1)

 DES-5Y supernovae, combined with DESI BAO, appear to favour Chevallier-Polarski-Linder $(w\_0, w\_a)$ dynamical dark energy over $\Lambda$CDM. arXiv:2408.07175 suggested that this is driven by a systematic in the DES pipeline, which particularly affects the low-redshift supernovae brought in from legacy surveys. It is difficult to investigate these data in isolation, however, as the complicated supernovae pipelines must properly account for selection effects. In this work, we discover that the Bayesian evidence previously found for flexknot dark energy (arXiv:2503.17342) is beaten by a magnitude offset between the low- and high-redshift supernovae. In addition, we find that the possible tension between DES-5Y and DESI is significantly reduced by such an offset. We also take the opportunity to trial Nested Bridge Sampling with Sequential Monte Carlo as an alternative method for calculating Bayes factors.

2025-09-16, **Two unseen massive white dwarf candidates in close binaries**, Yuta Shiraishi et.al., [2509.12808v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12808v1)

 We report the discovery of two binary systems, each consisting of a slightly bloated G-type main-sequence star and an unseen companion, identified through photometric data from TESS and radial velocity variation from Gaia. High-resolution spectroscopy confirms orbital periods of 1.37 and 2.67 days with circular orbits. The visible components have masses of $\sim 0.9\,M\_\odot$, while the minimum masses of the unseen companions are $1.073^{+0.058}\_{-0.060} M\_\odot$ and $0.919^{+0.049}\_{-0.051} M\_\odot$, respectively. Assuming tidal synchronization, we estimate the companion masses to be $1.12^{+0.10}\_{-0.08} M\_\odot$ and $1.02^{+0.15}\_{-0.10} M\_\odot$. The absence of detectable spectral features from the companions rules out main-sequence stars of these masses, suggesting that the unseen companions are likely O/Ne or C/O massive white dwarfs. The short orbital periods imply that these systems are post-common envelope binaries. Their subsequent evolution is uncertain, with possible outcomes including cataclysmic variables, Type Ia supernovae, or accretion-induced collapse, depending on the nature of future mass transfer.

2025-09-16, **Large-field CO(1-0) observations toward the Galactic historical supernova remnants: shocked molecular clouds toward the Crab Nebula**, Xuepeng Chen et.al., [2509.12622v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12622v1)

 Using the PMO 13.7m telescope, we present large-field and high-sensitivity CO(1-0) line observations toward the Crab Nebula, in order to better understand the interstellar gas environment of this well-known historical supernova remnant. The CO observations show molecular clouds toward the Crab Nebula at a velocity range from about 0 to 16 km/s. After checking the CO spectra, we find shocked signatures in the clouds extending at a velocity of roughly [5, 11] km/s. These shocked molecular clouds, with an angular distance of about 0.4-0.5 degree toward the Crab Nebula, are located at the shell of a bubble discovered in the GALFA-HI (and HI4PI) images at the same velocity range. The dimension of the bubble is roughly 2.3$\times$2.6 degree and the expansion velocity is about 5 km/s. The kinetic energy referred from the shocked molecular clouds (roughly 3.5$\times$10$^{51}$ erg), together with the HI bubble, support the picture that the Crab Nebula belongs to a typical core-collapse supernova remnant. Nevertheless, due to the large uncertainty in the distance measurement, further observations are needed to verify the physical association between the shocked molecular clouds and the Crab Nebula.

2025-09-15, **A high fraction of close massive binary stars at low metallicity**, H. Sana et.al., [2509.12488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12488v1)

 At high metallicity, a majority of massive stars have at least one close stellar companion. The evolution of such binaries is subject to strong interaction processes, heavily impacting the characteristics of their life-ending supernova and compact remnants. For the low-metallicity environments of high-redshift galaxies constraints on the multiplicity properties of massive stars over the separation range leading to binary interaction are crucially missing. Here we show that the presence of massive stars in close binaries is ubiquitous, even at low metallicity. Using the Very Large Telescope, we obtained multi-epoch radial velocity measurements of a representative sample of 139 massive O-type stars across the Small Magellanic Cloud, which has a metal content of about one fifth of the solar value. We find that 45% of them show radial velocity variations which demonstrate that they are members of close binary systems, and predominantly have orbital periods shorter than one year. Correcting for observational biases indicates that at least 70[+11:-6]% of the O stars in our sample are in close binaries, and that at least 68[+7:-8]% of all O stars interact with a companion star during their lifetime. We found no evidence supporting a statistically significant trend of the multiplicity properties with metallicity. Our results indicate that multiplicity and binary interactions govern the evolution of massive stars and determine their cosmic feedback and explosive fates.

2025-09-15, **When IIb Ceases To Be: Bridging the Gap Between IIb and Short-plateau Supernovae**, Joseph R. Farah et.al., [2509.12470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12470v1)

 Hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) span a range of hydrogen envelope masses at core collapse, producing diverse light curves from extended plateaus in Type II SNe to double-peaked Type IIb SNe. Recent hydrodynamic modeling predicts a continuous sequence of light-curve morphologies as hydrogen is removed, with short plateau SNe (plateau durations ~50--70 days) emerging as a transitional class. However, the observational boundary between IIb and short-plateau remains poorly defined, and thus far unobserved. We report on extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv, candidate transitional events on the low-mass end of the short-plateau class. Both exhibit weak, double-peaked light curves which we interpret as exceptionally short plateaus (10--20 days), and hybrid spectral features: persistent H$\alpha$ absorption with He I contamination, but without the helium dominance characteristic of IIb SNe. Using analytic shock-cooling models and numerical light curve fitting, we estimate hydrogen-rich envelope masses of ~0.6--0.8 $M\_\odot$ -- significantly larger than canonical IIb values ($\lesssim0.1\,M\_\odot$) but consistent with the ${\sim}0.9\,M\_\odot$ threshold predicted for short-plateau behavior. Although the progenitor radii inferred from analytic and numerical methods differ by factors of 2--5, envelope mass estimates are consistent across approaches. Comparisons to well-studied IIb (SN 2016gkg, SN 2022hnt), short-plateau (SN 2023ufx, SN 2006ai, SN 2016egz, SN 2006Y), and II SNe (SN 2023ixf, SN 2013ej) suggest a monotonic relationship between hydrogen envelope mass and plateau length consistent with analytic and numerical expectations. These findings provide additional evidence for a continuous distribution of envelope stripping in hydrogen-rich core-collapse progenitors and place SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv along the IIb/short-plateau boundary.

2025-09-15, **Search for Quintessence-Like Pseudoscalar Dark Energy Effects on $^{56}\text{Fe}$ Nuclear Transition Energies in Supernova 1991T**, Robert D. Orlando et.al., [2509.12422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12422v1)

 The nature of dark energy remains one of the most important unanswered problems in physics. Here we use gamma-ray spectra from the Type Ia supernova 1991T to constrain the recent evolution of a dynamical pseudoscalar quintessence-like field $Q(t)$. We found that the 1991T gamma rays emitted by the $^{56}\text{Fe}$ nuclei observed by COMPTEL aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory were slightly shifted to lower energies with respect to terrestrial values, with the average fractional energy shift of both the first and second excited states found to be $\delta E/E = -0.006\pm0.008$ including statistical and systematic errors. Assuming that this energy shift is caused by a dynamical QCD axion-like pseudoscalar field $Q(t)$, we find that observed energy deviations are consistent with a fractional rate of change of the pion mass given by $\delta \dot{m\_{\pi}}/m\_{\pi}=-(6\pm9)\times10^{-11}\text{ yr}^{-1}$. The observed energy deviation was also used to determine the rate of change of the quintessence-like field ($\dot{Q}\_0$) for tracking models: $\dot{Q}\_{0,max} = (3\pm 4)\times10^7 \text{ GeV/yr}$. Our findings are consistent with the cosmological constant ($\dot{Q}\_0 =0$). Furthermore, we have demonstrated how nuclear spectra produced by astrophysical events can be used to inform the nature and behavior of dark energy.

 SN 2024aecx is a nearby ($\sim$11 Mpc) Type IIb SN discovered within $\sim$1 d after explosion. In this paper we report high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations, conducted from as early as 0.27 d post discovery out to the nebular phase at 158.4 d. We analyze the environment of SN 2024aecx and derive a new distance, metallicity and host extinction. The light curve exhibits a hot and luminous shock-cooling peak at the first few days, followed by a main peak with very rapid post-maximum decline. The earliest spectra are blue and featureless, while from 2.3 d after discovery prominent P-Cygni profiles emerge. At nebular phase, the emission lines exhibit asymmetric and double-peaked profiles, indicating asphericity and/or early dust formation in the ejecta. We simulated the progenitor and explosion using a two-component model of shock cooling and radioactive $^{56}$Ni heating; our model favors an extended, low-mass H-rich envelope with$ M\_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.08^{+0.02}\_{-0.03}\, M\_{\odot} $ and a low ejecta mass of $ M\_{\mathrm{ej}} = 2.65^{+1.21}\_{-0.73} \, M\_{\odot}. $The comprehensive monitoring of SN 2024aecx, coupled with the detailed characterization of its local environment, establishes it as a benchmark event for probing the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of Type IIb SNe.

 We develop a two-scalar field quintom model, which utilises both a quintessence-like and a phantom-like scalar field, enabling a smooth and stable transition across the $w=-1$ phantom divide as hinted by recent measurements of Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2. We explore a range of initial conditions and potential configurations that facilitate such a phantom-to-quintessence-like crossing, and find that this can be naturally realised with hill-top or cliff-face potentials bound from above. We study how varying these conditions affects the dynamics of the system, calculate the background observables and compare them with DESI, CMB, and Type Ia supernova data, identifying a viable parameter space for our model. In particular, we find that a potential featuring a hyperbolic tangent form can successfully reproduce the desired phantom crossing, although such models can suffer from fine-tuning effects. Finally, we discuss prospects for distinguishing such models with upcoming state-of-the-art cosmological observations.

 We present a model-independent null test of the late-time cosmological response to a reduced sound horizon, as typically required by early-universe solutions to the Hubble tension. In this approach, we phenomenologically impose a shorter sound horizon without modeling early-universe physics to isolate its impact on late-time dark energy inference. Using baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), supernovae (SN), big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), and local $H\_0$ data, while explicitly avoiding CMB anisotropies, we examine how this calibration shift propagates into constraints on the dark energy equation of state. We find that lowering $r\_d$ systematically drives the $w\_0$-$w\_a$ posterior toward less dynamical, quintessence-like behavior, bringing it closer to $\Lambda$CDM. This result underscores that some of the apparent evidence for evolving or phantom-like dark energy may reflect early-universe assumptions rather than genuine late-time dynamics. More broadly, our analysis highlights the importance of carefully disentangling calibration effects from physical evolution in interpreting forthcoming results from DESI and future surveys.

 MACS J0138-2155 is the only known cluster to strongly lens two supernovae (SNe), Requiem and Encore, from the same host galaxy at z=1.949. We present seven independent mass models of the galaxy cluster built using six software packages. By conducting a blind analysis (no exchanges of results between modeling teams), we quantified uncertainties due to modeling and software. Through HST, JWST and MUSE observations, we assembled high-quality data products, including eight "gold" lensed image systems consisting of 23 images with secure spectroscopic redshifts, and one "silver" system with a likely redshift value. Restricting to the gold images, we obtain overall consistent model predictions of the positions, magnifications and time delays of SN Encore and SN Requiem images, especially for models with $\chi^2 \leq 25$. We predict the appearance of the next images of SNe Encore and Requiem with a time delay of >~3000 days and of ~3700 to 4000 days, respectively, based on a fiducial cosmological model of $H\_0 = 70 {\rm\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\Omega\_{\rm m} = 0.3$. We obtain relations between $H\_0$ and the time delays of SNe Encore and Requiem. In particular, for $H\_0 = 73 {\rm\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, the four lowest $\chi^2$ models predict SN Requiem to reappear in ~Apr-Dec 2026; for $H\_0 = 67 {\rm\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, in ~Mar-Nov 2027. Using the newly measured time delay between the two detected images of SN Encore by Pierel et al. (submitted) and our mass models, we jointly infer $H\_0 = {\rm 66.9^{+11.2}\_{-8.1}\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, where the uncertainty is dominated by that of the time delay. The long delays of the next-appearing SN Requiem and SN Encore images provide excellent opportunities to measure $H\_0$ with an uncertainty of 2-3%. Our mass models form the basis for cosmological inference from this unique lens cluster with two strongly lensed SNe. (Abridged)

2025-09-15, **Cosmology with supernova Encore in the strong lensing cluster MACS J0138-2155: Time delays & Hubble constant measurement**, J. D. R. Pierel et.al., [2509.12301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12301v1)

 Multiply-imaged supernovae (SNe) provide a novel means of constraining the Hubble constant ($H\_0$). Such measurements require a combination of precise models of the lensing mass distribution and an accurate estimate of the relative time delays between arrival of the multiple images. Only two multiply-imaged SNe, Refsdal and H0pe, have enabled measurements of $H\_0$ thus far. Here we detail the third such measurement for SN Encore, a $z=1.95$ SNIa discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging. We measure the time delay, perform simulations of additional microlensing and millilensing systematics, and combine with the mass models of Suyu et al. in a double-blind analysis to obtain our $H\_0$ constraint. Our final time-delay measurement is $\Delta t\_{1b,1a}=-39.8\_{-3.3}^{+3.9}$ days, which is combined with seven lens models weighted by the likelihood of the observed multiple image positions for a result of $H\_0=66.9\_{-8.1}^{+11.2} \rm{km} \rm{s}^{-1}\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The uncertainty on this measurement could be improved significantly if template imaging is obtained. Remarkably, a sibling to SN Encore (SN "Requiem") was discovered in the same host galaxy, making the MACS J0138.0-2155 cluster the first system known to produce more than one observed multiply-imaged SN. SN Requiem has a fourth image that is expected to appear within a few years, providing an unprecedented decade-long baseline for time-delay cosmography and an opportunity for a high-precision joint estimate of $H\_0$.

2025-09-15, **Chandra Large Project Observations of the Supernova Remnant N132D: Measuring the Expansion of the Forward Shock**, Xi Long et.al., [2509.12157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12157v1)

 We present results from the Chandra X-ray Observatory Large Project (878 ks in 28 observations) of the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant N132D. We measure the expansion of the forward shock in the bright southern rim to be $0.\!^{\prime\prime}10 \pm 0.\!^{\prime\prime}02$ over the $\sim14.5$ yr baseline, which corresponds to a velocity of $1620\pm400~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ after accounting for several instrumental effects. We measure an expansion of $0.\!^{\prime\prime}23 \pm 0.\!^{\prime\prime}02$ and a shock velocity of $3840\pm260~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ for two features in an apparent blowout region in the northeast. The emission-measure-weighted average temperature inferred from X-ray spectral fits to regions in the southern rim is $0.95\pm0.17$ keV, consistent with the electron temperature implied by the shock velocity after accounting for Coulomb equilibration and adiabatic expansion. In contrast, the emission-measure-weighted average temperature for the northeast region is $0.77\pm0.04$ keV, which is significantly lower than the value inferred from the shock velocity. We fit 1-D evolutionary models for the shock in the southern rim and northeast region, using the measured radius and propagation velocity into a constant density and power-law profile circumstellar medium. We find good agreement with the age of $\sim2500$ years derived from optical expansion measurements for explosion energies of $1.5-3.0 \times 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$, ejecta masses of $2-6 \,\mathrm{M\_{\odot}}$ and ambient medium densities of $\sim0.33-0.66$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the south and $\sim0.01-0.02$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the northeast assuming a constant density medium. These results are consistent with previous studies that suggested the progenitor of N132D was an energetic supernova that exploded into a pre-existing cavity.

2025-09-15, **Observational Evidence of Dust Evolution in Supernova Remnants: Size Redistribution Toward Larger Grains in Early Sedov Phase**, He Zhao et.al., [2509.12067v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12067v1)

 Recent observations have revealed that dust is widespread and abundant in galaxies up to $z\,{\backsimeq}\,8$, significantly influencing their appearance and spectral properties. In the early Universe, dust is thought to form primarily in supernova (SN) ejecta, but also undergoes destruction by the reverse shock. Studying dust in local supernova remnants (SNRs) of different sizes and ages thus provides key constraints on dust formation and evolution during cosmic dawn. Using the newly released 3D $R\_{\rm V}$ map, we derived local $R\_{\rm V} \equiv A\_{\rm V}/E(B-V)$ values for dust in 14 Galactic SNRs in the early Sedov phase and their surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we detect a moderately strong positive correlation between the difference in SNR and ISM $R\_{\rm V}$ ($\Delta R\_{\rm V}$) and SNR radius ($R\_{\rm SNR}$), with a Spearman coefficient of $r\_{\rm s}\,{=}\,0.62\,{\pm}\,0.14$. This trend offers direct observational evidence for a redistribution of dust grain sizes toward larger grains during SN shock processing, consistent with theoretical models. Our findings provide essential observational constraints on dust size evolution in SNRs and important implications for understanding the rapid enrichment and survival of dust in the early Universe.

2025-09-15, **The dependence of the Type Ia Supernova colour-luminosity relation on their host galaxy properties**, S. Ramaiya et.al., [2509.12035v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12035v1)

 Using the Dark Energy Survey 5-year sample, we determine the properties of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies across a wide multi-wavelength range - from the optical to far-infrared - including data from the $Herschel$ and $Spitzer$ space telescopes. We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M\_\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\beta\_{\mathrm{R\_1}} = 3.51 \pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\sim}6\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\beta\_{\mathrm{R\_3}} = 2.12 \pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($>3\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M\_\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.

2025-09-15, **Testing CCC+TL Cosmology with Galaxy Rotation Curves**, Rajendra P. Gupta et.al., [2509.11896v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11896v1)

 This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the Universe's expansion and Zwicky's tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that the CCC parameter {\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark matter and dark energy, which we call {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy, and is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically {\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe, e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions, one expects {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database and find the results promising.

2025-09-15, **Astrophysics: a Modern Discipline with a Newtonian origin**, M. Paola Vaccaro et.al., [2509.11886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11886v1)

 Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.

2025-09-15, **Self-lensing binaries as probes of Supernova physics**, Grzegorz Wiktorowicz et.al., [2509.11726v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11726v1)

 Self-lensing (SL) in binary systems has the potential to provide a unique observational window into the Galactic population of compact objects. Using the $\mathtt{startrack}$ and COSMIC population synthesis codes, we investigate how different supernova mechanisms affect the observable population of SL systems, with particular attention to the mass gap (2$\mathrm{-}$5 M$\_\odot$) in compact object distributions. We test three supernova remnant formation models with different convective growth timescales ($f\_{\rm mix}$ = 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0), simulating SL binary systems across the Galactic disk and bulge. We identify distinct groupings of SL sources based on lens mass and Einstein crossing time, clearly differentiating neutron star from black hole systems and close from wide orbits. Notably, the delayed $f\_{\rm mix} = 0.5$ model predicts a significantly higher fraction of systems with lens masses in the mass gap region (up to $\sim10$ times more for certain surveys), suggesting that SL observations could help constrain this controversial population. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for systems with low centre-of-mass velocities ($v\_{\rm cm}\leq20$ km/s) across all models, resulting primarily from physical processes governing compact object formation and binary survival. While many potential detections will have limited observational coverage, ZTF is predicted to yield several dozen well-covered systems that should enable detailed characterization. When applying simple detection criteria including photometric precision and signal-to-noise requirements, predicted rates decrease by approximately two orders of magnitude, but still yield up to a few tens of expected detections for LSST and ZTF in the Galactic disk population.
