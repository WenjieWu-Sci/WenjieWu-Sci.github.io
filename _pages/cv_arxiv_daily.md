2023-04-03, **IceCat-1: the IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2304.01174v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01174v1)

 We present a catalog of likely astrophysical neutrino track-like events from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. IceCube began reporting likely astrophysical neutrinos in 2016 and this system was updated in 2019. IceCube began reporting likely astrophysical neutrinos in 2016 and this system was updated in 2019. The catalog presented here includes events that were reported in real-time since 2019, as well as events identified in archival data samples starting from 2011. We report 275 neutrino events from two selection channels as the first entries in the catalog, the IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks, which will see ongoing extensions with additional alerts. The gold and bronze alert channels respectively provide neutrino candidates with 50\% and 30\% probability of being astrophysical, on average assuming an astrophysical neutrino power law energy spectral index of 2.19. For each neutrino alert, we provide the reconstructed energy, direction, false alarm rate, probability of being astrophysical in origin, and likelihood contours describing the spatial uncertainty in the alert's reconstructed location. We also investigate a directional correlation of these neutrino events with gamma-ray and X-ray catalogs including 4FGL, 3HWC, TeVCat and Swift-BAT.

2023-04-03, **Invariant mass reconstruction of heavy gauge bosons decaying to $Ï„$ leptons using machine learning techniques**, Vinaya Krishnan MB et.al., [2304.01126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01126v1)

 Many analyses are performed by the LHC experiments to search for heavy gauge bosons, which appear in several new physics models. The invariant mass reconstruction of heavy gauge bosons is difficult when they decay to $\tau$ leptons due to missing neutrinos in the final state. Machine learning techniques are widely utilized in experimental high-energy physics, in particular in analyzing the large amount of data produced at the LHC. In this paper, we study machine learning techniques such as supervised and unsupervised neural network algorithms to reconstruct the invariant mass of $Z^{\prime}~\rightarrow~\tau\tau$ and $W^{\prime}~\rightarrow~\tau\nu$ decays, which can improve the sensitivity of these searches.

2023-04-03, **Investigating starburst-driven neutrino emission from galaxies in the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey**, Yarno Merckx et.al., [2304.01020v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01020v1)

 We present a phenomenological framework for starburst-driven neutrino production via proton-proton collisions and apply it to (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). The framework relates the infrared luminosity of a GOALS galaxy, derived from consistently available Herschel Space Observatory data, to the expected starburst-driven neutrino flux. The model parameters that define this relation can be estimated from multi-wavelength data. We apply the framework in a case study to the LIRG NGC 3690 (Arp 299, Mrk 171) and compare the obtained neutrino fluxes to the current sensitivity of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Using our framework, we also conclude that the neutrino emission in the LIRG NGC 1068, recently presented as the first steady IceCube neutrino point source, cannot be explained by a starburst-driven scenario and is therefore likely dominated by the active galactic nucleus in this galaxy. In addition to the single-source investigations, we also estimate the diffuse starburst-driven neutrino flux from GOALS galaxies and the total LIRG population over cosmic history.

2023-04-03, **Sterile neutrino searches with reactor antineutrinos using coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments**, S. P. Behera et.al., [2304.00912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00912v1)

 We present an analysis on the sensitivity to the active-sterile neutrino mixing with Germanium (Ge) and Silicon (Si) detectors in the context of proposed coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus experiment in India. The study has been carried out with 3 (active) + 1 (sterile) neutrino oscillation model. It is observed that the measurements that can be carried out with Ge detector give better sensitivity for the active-sterile neutrino mixing as compared to Si detector. Both the detectors are able to exclude most of the anomaly regions observed by the GALLIUM experiment. The Ge detector with mass 10 kg can observe the active sterile neutrino oscillation at 95$\%$ confidence level provided \sin^{2}2\theta\_{14}\geq 0.09 at \Delta m^{2}\_{41} = 1.0 eV^{2} for an exposure of 1-yr. At higher values of \Delta m^{2}\_{41} the better sensitivity is obtained at short baseline. It is also found that the threshold as well as resolution of detectors play a crucial role for measuring the active-sterile neutrino mixing parameters.

2023-04-03, **Constraints on the localization volume of High Energy Neutrinos for galaxy-targetted electromagnetic followups**, Thierry Pradier et.al., [2304.00831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00831v1)

 High Energy Neutrino telescopes such as IceCube or KM3NeT issue public alerts describing the characteristics of possible astrophysical high energy neutrino events. This information, in particular the arrival direction and the associated uncertainty of the neutrino candidates, is used by observatories to search for possible electromagnetic counterparts. Such searches are complicated by the localization areas as high as tens of squared degrees or more and the absence of constraints on the distance or nature of the source, contrarily to gravitational wave alerts issued by instruments such as LIGO/Virgo. A method to derive a probable distance for the astrophysical source possibly associated to a HEN event is described, which can be used in a cross-match with galaxy catalogues to search for possible electromagnetic counterparts. This is intended as a guide for high energy neutrino followup campaigns.

2023-04-02, **Dirac and Majorana neutrino scattering by cosmic torsion in spatial-flat FRW spacetime background**, Wei Lin et.al., [2304.00475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00475v1)

 The possibility of distinguishing Dirac and Majorana fermions by cosmic torsion in the spatial-flat FRW spacetime is discussed. The scattering amplitudes of two types of fermions deviate from each other by the vector part of torsion in non-minimal coupling case. The scattering of massive fermions by cosmic torsion leads to a shift of final state energy distribution. The difference between shift values of two types of fermions can be used to distinguish fermion types of neutrinos.

2023-04-03, **Supermassive Dark Star candidates seen by JWST?**, Cosmin Ilie et.al., [2304.01173v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01173v1)

 The first generation of stars in the Universe is yet to be observed. There are two leading theories for those objects that mark the beginning of the cosmic dawn: hydrogen burning Population~III stars and Dark Stars, made of hydrogen and helium but powered by Dark Matter heating. The latter can grow to become supermassive ($M\_\star\sim 10^6\Msun$) and extremely bright ($L\sim 10^9L\_\odot$). We show that each of the following three objects: JADES-GS-z13-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z11-0 (at redshifts $z\in[11,14]$) are consistent with a Supermassive Dark Star interpretation, thus identifying, for the first time, Dark Star candidates.

2023-04-03, **Investigating the GmSUGRA in the MSSM through the long-lived bino NLSP at the HL-LHC**, Wenxing Zhang et.al., [2304.01082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01082v1)

 The axino, the supersymmetric partner of axion, is a well-motivated warm/hot dark matter candidate, and provides a natural solution to the relic density problem for the bino-like neutralino if it is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). With the Generalized Minimal Supergravity, we study such kind of the viable parameter space where the bino-like neutralino is the next-to-LSP (NLSP) and the axino is the LSP. In addition, we consider a scenario where the bino is a long-lived NLSP with the lifetime varying from $10^{-6}$s to $10^{-4}$s, and then propose a new signal searching scheme involving one displaced photon together with the large missing transverse momentum at the HL-LHC. The bino-like lightest neutralino lies under or around 100 GeV and is produced as a decay product of the right-handed sleptons.The relevant axion coupling $f\_a$ can be probed up to $\mathcal{O}(10^9)$ GeV at 2$\sigma$ level for the right-handed slepton mass under 300 GeV and the lightest neutralino mass under 100 GeV.

2023-04-03, **$Sp(2N)$ Lattice Gauge Theories and Extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics**, Ed Bennett et.al., [2304.01070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01070v1)

 We review the current status of the long-term programme of numerical investigation of $Sp(2N)$ gauge theories with and without fermionic matter content. We start by introducing the phenomenological as well as theoretical motivations for this research programme, which are related to composite Higgs models, models of partial top compositeness, dark matter models, and in general to the physics of strongly coupled theories and their approach to the large-N limit. We summarise the results of lattice studies conducted so far in the $Sp(2N)$ Yang-Mills theories, measuring the string tension, the mass spectrum of glueballs and the topological susceptibility, and discuss their large-N extrapolation. We then focus our discussion on $Sp(4)$, and summarise numerical measurements of mass and decay constant of mesons in the theories with fermion matter in either the fundamental or the antisymmetric representation, first in the quenched approximation, and then with dynamical fermions. We finally discuss the case of dynamical fermions in mixed representations, and exotic composite fermion states such as the chimera baryons. We conclude by sketching the future stages of the programme. And we describe our approach to open access.

2023-04-03, **Solar radio emissions and ultralight dark matter**, Haipeng An et.al., [2304.01056v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01056v1)

 Ultralight axions and dark photons are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Inside the plasma, once the mass of ultralight dark matter candidates equals the plasma frequency, they can resonantly convert into electromagnetic waves, due to the coupling between the ultralight dark matter particles and the standard model photons. The converted electromagnetic waves are monochromatic. In this article, we review the development of using radio detectors to search for ultralight dark matter conversions in the solar corona and solar wind plasma.

2023-04-03, **Freeze-in of WIMP dark matter**, Xiaorui Wong et.al., [2304.00908v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00908v1)

 We propose a novel scenario for dark matter (DM) in which weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can freeze-in due to a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the early Universe. The FOPT dilutes the preexisting DM density to zero, and leads to a sudden change in DM mass that prevents WIMPs from re-equilibrating due to their large mass-to-temperature ratio. Following the FOPT, WIMPs are produced via a freeze-in process, even though their interactions are NOT feeble. We demonstrate this concept using a simplified model and then realize the scenario in a realistic model with a delayed electroweak phase transition. Our work extends the category of WIMP DM and opens up a new direction for the freeze-in mechanism.

2023-04-03, **Reanalysis of the Systematic Uncertainties in Cosmic-Ray Antiproton Flux**, Xing-Jian Lv et.al., [2304.00760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00760v1)

 Recent studies on cosmic rays (CRs) have reported the possibility of an excess in the antiproton flux around $10-20$ GeV. However, the associated systematic uncertainties have impeded the interpretation of these findings. In this study, we conduct a global Bayesian analysis to constrain the propagation parameters and evaluate the CR antiproton spectrum, while comprehensively accounting for uncertainties associated with interstellar CR propagation, production cross sections for antiprotons and other secondaries, and the charge and energy dependent effects of solar modulation. We establish that the most recent AMS-02 $\bar{p}$ spectrum is in agreement with a pure secondary origin. Based on this, we establish upper limits on dark matter (DM) annihilation. We also determine that the AMS-02 data favors the empirical hadronic interaction models over phenomenological ones. Finally, we find that the latest AMS-02 antiproton data from 2011 to 2018 disfavors the antiproton excess at $\mathcal{O}$(10) GeV and the corresponding DM interpretation that can simultaneously account for the Galactic Center excess in the gamma-ray observation.

2023-04-03, **Modelling Dark Matter Halo Spin using Observations and Simulations: application to UGC 5288**, Sioree Ansar et.al., [2304.00724v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00724v1)

 Dark matter (DM) halo properties are extensively studied in cosmological simulations but are very challenging to estimate from observations. The DM halo density profile of observed galaxies is modelled using multiple probes that trace the dark matter potential. However, the angular momentum distribution of DM halos is still a subject of debate. In this study we investigate a method for estimating the halo spin and halo concentration of low surface brightness (LSB), gas-rich dwarf barred galaxy UGC 5288, by forward modelling disk properties derived from observations - stellar and gas surface densities, disk scale length, HI rotation curve, bar length and bar ellipticity. We combine semi-analytical techniques, N-body/SPH and cosmological simulations to model the DM halo of UGC 5288 with both a cuspy Hernquist profile and a flat-core pseudo-isothermal profile. We find that the best match with observations is a pseudo-isothermal halo model with a core radius of $r\_{c} = 0.23$ kpc, and halo spin of $\lambda$= 0.08 at the virial radius. Although our findings are consistent with previous core radius estimates of the halo density profile of UGC 5288, as well as with the halo spin profiles of similar mass analogues of UGC5288 in the high-resolution cosmological-magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, there still remain some uncertainties as we are limited in our knowledge of the formation history of the galaxy. Additionally, we find that the inner halo spin ($ r< 10$ kpc) in barred galaxies is different from the unbarred ones, and the halo spin shows weak correlations with bar properties.

2023-04-03, **Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 Results: Cosmology from Cosmic Shear Two-point Correlation Functions**, Xiangchong Li et.al., [2304.00702v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00702v1)

 We perform a blinded cosmology analysis with cosmic shear two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) measured from more than 25 million galaxies in the Hyper Suprime-Cam three-year shear catalog in four tomographic redshift bins ranging from 0.3 to 1.5. After conservative masking and galaxy selection, the survey covers 416 deg$^2$ of the northern sky with an effective galaxy number density of 15 arcmin$^{-2}$ over the four redshift bins. The 2PCFs adopted for cosmology analysis are measured in the angular range: $7.1 < \theta/{\rm arcmin} < 56.6$ for $\xi\_+$ and $31.2 <\theta/{\rm arcmin} < 248$ for $\xi\_-$, with a total signal-to-noise ratio of 26.6. We apply a conservative, wide, flat prior on the photometric redshift errors on the last two tomographic bins, and the relative magnitudes of the cosmic shear amplitude across four redshift bins allow us to calibrate the photometric redshift errors. With this flat prior on redshift errors, we find $\Omega\_{\rm m}=0.256\_{-0.044}^{+0.056}$ and $S\_8\equiv \sigma\_8 \sqrt{\Omega\_{\rm m}/0.3}=0.769\_{-0.034}^{+0.031}$ (both 68\% CI) for a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology. We find, after unblinding, that our constraint on $S\_8$ is consistent with the Fourier space cosmic shear and the 3$\times$2pt analyses on the same HSC dataset. We carefully study the potential systematics from astrophysical and systematic model uncertainties in our fiducial analysis using synthetic data, and report no biases (including projection bias in the posterior space) greater than $0.5\sigma$ in the estimation of $S\_8$. Our analysis hints that the mean redshifts of the two highest tomographic bins are higher than initially estimated. In addition, a number of consistency tests are conducted to assess the robustness of our analysis. Comparing our result with Planck-2018 cosmic microwave background observations, we find a ~$2\sigma$ tension for the $\Lambda$CDM model.

2023-04-02, **Dark Matter in a bi-metric universe**, Carlos Maldonado et.al., [2304.00620v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00620v1)

 We study the possibility to describe dark matter in a model of the universe with two scale factors and a non-standard Poisson bracket structure characterized by the deformation parameter \kappa. The dark matter evolution is analyzed in the early stages of the universe, and its relic density is obtained via the Freeze-In and Freeze-Out mechanism. We show that by fixing \k{appa} and the initial ratio of energy densities present in the different sectors of the universe, the space of thermal average annihilation cross-sections and dark matter masses compatible with the standard cosmology prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), is enlarged. This feature of the model is compatible with non-standard cosmology.

2023-04-02, **A Long-Baseline Atom Interferometer at CERN: Conceptual Feasibility Study**, G. Arduini et.al., [2304.00614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00614v1)

 We present results from exploratory studies, supported by the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) Study Group, of the suitability of a CERN site and its infrastructure for hosting a vertical atom interferometer (AI) with a baseline of about 100 m. We first review the scientific motivations for such an experiment to search for ultralight dark matter and measure gravitational waves, and then outline the general technical requirements for such an atom interferometer, using the AION-100 project as an example. We present a possible CERN site in the PX46 access shaft to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), including the motivations for this choice and a description of its infrastructure. We then assess its compliance with the technical requirements of such an experiment and what upgrades may be needed. We analyse issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine and its ancillary hardware and present a preliminary safety analysis and the required mitigation measures and infrastructure modifications. In conclusion, we identify primary cost drivers and describe constraints on the experimental installation and operation schedules arising from LHC operation. We find no technical obstacles: the CERN site is a very promising location for an AI experiment with a vertical baseline of about 100 m.

2023-04-02, **Stochastic Multiple Fields Inflation: Diffusion Dominated Regime**, Kosar Asadi et.al., [2304.00577v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00577v1)

 We study multiple fields inflation in diffusion dominated regime using stochastic $\delta N$ formalism. The fields are under pure Brownian motion in a dS background with boundaries in higher dimensional field space. This setup can be realized towards the final stages of the ultra slow-roll setup where the classical drifts fall off exponentially and the perturbations are driven by quantum kicks. We consider both symmetric and asymmetric boundaries with absorbing and reflective boundary conditions and calculate the average number of e-folds, the first crossing probabilities and the power spectrum. We study the primordial black holes (PBHs) formation in this setup and calculate the mass fraction and the contribution of PBHs in dark matter energy density for various higher dimensional field spaces.

2023-04-02, **Modified Newtonian Dynamics as an Alternative to the Planet Nine Hypothesis**, Katherine Jones-Smith et.al., [2304.00576v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00576v1)

 A new class of Kuiper belt objects that lie beyond Neptune with semimajor axes greater than 250 astronomical units show orbital anomalies that have been interpreted as evidence for an undiscovered ninth planet. We show that a modified gravity theory known as MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) provides an alternative explanation for the anomalies using the well-established secular approximation. We predict that the major axes of the orbits will be aligned with the direction towards the galactic center and that the orbits cluster in phase space, in agreement with observations of Kuiper belt objects from the new class. Thus MOND, which can explain galactic rotation without invoking dark matter, might also be observable in the outer solar system.

2023-04-03, **Constraints on the frequency and mass content of r-process events derived from turbulent mixing in galactic disks**, A. N. Kolborg et.al., [2304.01144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01144v1)

 Metal-poor stars in the Milky Way (MW) halo display large star-to-star dispersion in their r-process abundance relative to lighter elements. This suggests a chemically diverse and unmixed interstellar medium (ISM) in the early Universe. This study aims to help shed light on the impact of turbulent mixing, driven by core collapse supernovae (cc-SNe), on the r-process abundance dispersal in galactic disks. To this end, we conduct a series of simulations of small-scale galaxy patches which resolve metal mixing mechanisms at parsec scales. Our set-up includes cc-SNe feedback and enrichment from r-process sources. We find that the relative rate of the r-process events to cc-SNe is directly imprinted on the shape of the r-process distribution in the ISM with more frequent events causing more centrally peaked distributions. We consider also the fraction of metals that is lost on galactic winds and find that cc-SNe are able to efficiently launch highly enriched winds, especially in smaller galaxy models. This result suggests that smaller systems, e.g. dwarf galaxies, may require higher levels of enrichment in order to achieve similar mean r-process abundances as MW-like progenitors systems. Finally, we are able to place novel constraints on the production rate of r-process elements in the MW, $6 \times 10^{-7} {M\_\odot / \rm yr} \lesssim \dot{m}\_{\rm rp} \ll 4.7 \times 10^{-4} {M\_\odot / \rm yr} $, imposed by accurately reproducing the mean and dispersion of [Eu/Fe] in metal-poor stars. Our results are consistent with independent estimates from alternate methods and constitute a significant reduction in the permitted parameter space.

2023-04-03, **Investigating the gamma-ray burst from decaying MeV-scale axion-like particles produced in supernova explosions**, Eike MÃ¼ller et.al., [2304.01060v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01060v1)

 We investigate the characteristics of the gamma-ray signal following the decay of MeV-scale Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) coupled to photons which are produced in a Supernova (SN) explosion. This analysis is the first to include the production of heavier ALPs through the photon coalescence process, enlarging the mass range of ALPs that could be observed in this way and giving a stronger bound from the observation of SN 1987A. Furthermore, we present a new analytical method for calculating the predicted gamma-ray signal from ALP decays. With this method we can rigorously prove the validity of an approximation that has been used in some of the previous literature, which we show here to be valid only if all gamma rays arrive under extremely small observation angles (i.e. very close to the line of sight to the SN). However, it also shows where the approximation is not valid, and offers an efficient alternative to calculate the ALP-induced gamma-ray flux in a general setting when the observation angles are not guaranteed to be small. We also estimate the sensitivity of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) to this gamma-ray signal from a future nearby SN and show that in the case of a non-observation the current bounds on the ALP-photon coupling $ g\_{a\gamma} $ are strengthened by about an order of magnitude. In the case of an observation, we show that it may be possible to reconstruct the product $ g\_{a\gamma}^2 m\_a $, with $ m\_a $ the mass of the ALP.

2023-04-02, **Origin of high-velocity ejecta and early red excess emission in the infant Type Ia supernova 2021aefx**, Yuan Qi Ni et.al., [2304.00625v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00625v1)

 \object{SN 2021aefx} is a normal Type Ia Supernova (SN) with red excess emission over the first $\sim$ 2 days. We present detailed analysis of this SN using our high-cadence KMTNet multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and publicly available data. We provide the first measurements of its epochs of explosion (MJD 59529.32 $\pm$ 0.16) as well as ``first light'' (MJD 59529.85 $\pm$ 0.55) associated with the main ejecta ${\rm{^{56}Ni}}$ distribution. This places our first detection of SN 2021aefx at $\sim -$0.5 hours since ``first light'', indicating the presence of additional power sources. Our peak-spectrum confirms its Type Ia sub-classification as intermediate between Core-Normal and Broad-Line, and we estimate the ejecta mass to be $\sim$ 1.34 $M\_{\odot}$. The pre-peak spectral evolution identifies fast-expanding material reaching $>$ 40,000 km s$^{-1}$ (the fastest ever observed in Type Ia SNe) and at least two distinct homologously-expanding ejecta components: (1) a normal-velocity (12,400 km s$^{-1}$) component consistent with the typical photospheric evolution of Chandrasekhar-mass ejecta; and (2) a high-velocity (23,500 km s$^{-1}$) component visible during the first $\sim$ 3.6 days post-explosion, which locates the component within the outer $<$ 16\% of the ejecta mass. Asymmetric, subsonic explosion processes producing a non-spherical photosphere provide an explanation for the simultaneous presence of the two components, as well as the red excess emission via a slight ${\rm{^{56}Ni}}$ enrichment in the outer $\sim$ 0.5\% of the ejecta mass. Our spectrum from 300 days post-peak advances the constraint against non-degenerate companions and further supports a near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion origin. Off-center ignited delayed-detonations of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs may be responsible for the observed features of SN 2021aefx in some normal Type Ia SNe.
