2025-04-10, **Testing Leptogenesis from Observable Gravitational Waves**, Wei Liu et.al., [2504.07819v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07819v1)

 Leptogenesis provides an elegant mechanism to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU), yet its experimental verification remains challenging due to requirements of either extremely heavy right-handed neutrinos or precisely fine-tuned mass splittings. We adapt a solution by introducing an extra scalar field that significantly enhances $CP$ asymmetry through loop-level contributions. This scalar extension not only facilitates successful leptogenesis but also enables a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, generating potentially observable gravitational waves (GWs). We demonstrate a strong correlation between the generated BAU and the GW signal strength, establishing a unique way to test the leptogenesis. We show that when the model achieves a successful BAU, the resulting GW signal from EWPT can have signal-to-noise ratio of $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ at the upcoming LISA and DECIGO experiments, respectively. This work presents a concrete connection between successful leptogenesis and detectable GWs, offering a promising method for experimental testing of the leptogenesis mechanism through future GW observations.

2025-04-10, **The effect of background matter on the spin oscillations of neutrinos scattered by the supermassive black hole**, Mridupawan Deka et.al., [2504.07816v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07816v1)

 We study spin oscillations of neutrinos in relativistic moving matter inside an accretion disk. These neutrinos are gravitationally scattered off a spinning Kerr black hole surrounded by a thick accretion disk. The disk can co-rotate and counter-rotate with respect to BH spin. We perform numerical simulations of the propagation of a large number of incoming test neutrinos. We briefly discuss our results.

2025-04-10, **Symmetry energy dependence of the bulk viscosity of nuclear matter**, Yumu Yang et.al., [2504.07805v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07805v1)

 We clarify how the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity $\zeta$ and the bulk relaxation time $\tau\_\Pi$ of neutrino-transparent $npe$ matter depend on the nuclear symmetry energy. We show that, at saturation density, the equation-of-state dependence of these transport quantities is fully determined by the experimentally constrained nuclear symmetry energy $S$ and its slope $L$. Variations of $L$ within current experimental uncertainties can change the (frequency-independent) bulk viscosity by orders of magnitude. This suggests that dissipative effects encoded in the gravitational-wave signatures of binary neutron star inspirals may help constrain nuclear symmetry energy properties.

2025-04-10, **Millimeter emission from supermassive black hole coronae**, S. del Palacio et.al., [2504.07762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07762v1)

 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The accretion can lead to the formation of a hot, X-ray emitting corona close to the SMBH capable of accelerating relativistic electrons. Observations in the millimetre (mm) band can probe its synchrotron emission. We provide a framework to derive physical information of SMBH coronae by modelling their spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to far infrared frequencies. We also explore the possibilities of deriving additional information from mm observations, such as the SMBH mass, and studying high-redshift lensed sources. We introduce a corona emission model based on a one-zone spherical region with a hybrid thermal and non-thermal plasma. We investigate in detail how the corona SED depends on different parameters such as size, opacity, and magnetic field strength. Other galactic emission components from dust, ionised gas and diffuse relativistic electrons are also included in the SED fitting scheme. We apply our code consistently to a sample of radio-quiet AGN with strong indications of a coronal component in the mm. The detected mm emission from SMBH coronae is consistent with having a non-thermal relativistic particle population with an energy density that is ~0.5-10% of that in the thermal plasma. This requires magnetic energy densities close to equipartition with the thermal gas, and corona sizes of 60-250 gravitational radii. The model can also reproduce the observed correlation between mm emission and SMBH mass when accounting for uncertainties in the corona size. The mm band offers a unique window into the physics of SMBH coronae, enabling the study of highly dust-obscured sources and high-redshift lensed quasars. Gaining a deeper understanding of the relativistic particle population in SMBH coronae can provide key insights into their potential multiwavelength and neutrino emission.

2025-04-10, **Stupendously Large Primordial Black Holes from the QCD axion**, Miguel Faria et.al., [2504.07890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07890v1)

 The inflationary diffusion of (pseudo-)scalar fields with discrete symmetries can seed the formation of a gas of closed domain walls after inflation, when the distance between degenerate minima in field space is not too far from the inflationary Hubble scale. Primordial black holes (PBHs) can then be formed once sufficiently heavy domain walls re-enter the Hubble sphere. In this scenario, inflation determines a distinctive PBH mass distribution that is rather flat and can thus lead to a sizable total abundance of PBHs, while avoiding some of the downsides of PBH formation from critical collapse. We show that generic QCD axion models, with decay constant close to the inflationary Hubble scale, can yield up to $1\%$ of the dark matter (DM) today in the form of PBHs, while being compatible with isocurvature constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background observations. This occurs for values of axion decay constants around $f\_a\simeq 10^{8}~\text{GeV}$, that is the region targeted by axion helioscopes and partially constrained by astrophysical observations. The resulting PBHs have \textit{stupendously} large masses, above $10^{11}M\_\odot$, and their existence can be probed by Large Scale Structure observations. Larger PBH abundances can be generated by axion-like particles. Alternatively, in scenarios where isocurvature constraints can be relaxed, we find that the totality of the DM can be produced by the QCD axion misalignment mechanism, accompanied by a ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ DM fraction in PBHs of masses $(10^5-10^6)~M\_\odot$. These can act as seeds for the formation of massive black holes at large redshifts, as suggested by recent JWST observations.

2025-04-10, **Horizons, throats and bounces in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a non-zero potential**, Gabriel I. RÃ³is et.al., [2504.07861v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07861v1)

 This work conducts an in-depth exploration of exact electrically charged solutions, including traversable wormholes, black holes, and black bounces, within the framework of the scalar-tensor representation of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) with a non-zero scalar potential. By integrating principles from both the metric and Palatini formulations, HMPG provides a flexible approach to addressing persistent challenges in General Relativity (GR), such as the late-time cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark matter. Under the assumption of spherical symmetry, we employ an inverse problem technique to derive exact solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. This method naturally leads to configurations involving either canonical or phantom scalar fields. A thorough examination of horizon structures, throat conditions, asymptotic behaviour, and curvature regularity (via the Kretschmann scalar) reveals the intricate causal structures permitted by this theoretical model. The analysis uncovers a diverse range of geometric configurations, with the phantom sector exhibiting a notably richer spectrum of solutions than the canonical case. These solutions encompass traversable wormholes, black universe models, where the interior of a black hole evolves into an expanding cosmological phase rather than a singularity, as well as black bounce structures and multi-horizon black holes. The results demonstrate that introducing a non-zero scalar potential within HMPG significantly expands the array of possible gravitational solutions, yielding complex causal and curvature properties that go beyond standard GR. Consequently, HMPG stands out as a powerful theoretical framework for modelling extreme astrophysical environments, where deviations from classical gravity are expected to play a crucial role.

2025-04-10, **Conversion-Driven Freeze-Out: A Common Framework for Dark Matter and Baryogenesis**, Jan Heisig et.al., [2504.07859v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07859v1)

 We explore dark matter genesis beyond the WIMP paradigm, focusing on the mechanism of conversion-driven freeze-out. This mechanism enables the thermalization of dark matter despite its very weak couplings. While the scenario evades conventional WIMP searches, it predicts novel signatures of long-lived particles at colliders, making it a prime target for upcoming LHC searches. We review various model realizations of this mechanism, highlighting its deep connections to other unresolved problems of the Standard Model. In particular, we show how conversion-driven freeze-out can naturally give rise to baryogenesis, offering a compelling perspective on the origins of both dark and baryonic matter.

2025-04-10, **The Cosmological Evidence for Non-Minimal Coupling**, William J. Wolf et.al., [2504.07679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07679v1)

 The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field $\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2<0$. Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm 0.60$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.

2025-04-10, **Power spectrum of the CODEX clusters**, Valtteri Lindholm et.al., [2504.07613v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07613v1)

 Aims. We analyze the clustering of galaxy clusters in a large contiguous sample, the Constrain Dark Energy with X-ray (CODEX) sample. We construct a likelihood for cosmological parameters by comparing the measured clustering signal and a theoretical prediction, and use this to obtain parameter constraints. Methods. We measured the three multipole moments (monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole, $\ell = 0, 2, 4$) of the power spectrum of a subset of the CODEX clusters. To fully model cluster clustering, we also determined the expected clustering bias of the sample using estimates for the cluster masses and a mass-to-bias model calibrated using N-body simulations. We estimated the covariance matrix of the measured power spectrum multipoles using a set of simulated dark-matter halo catalogs. Combining all these ingredients, we performed a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of cosmological parameters $\Omega\_m$ and $\sigma\_8$ to obtain their posterior. Results. We found the CODEX clustering signal to be consistent with an earlier X-ray selected cluster sample, the REFLEX II sample. We also found that the measured power spectrum multipoles are compatible with the predicted, bias-scaled linear matter power spectrum when the cosmological parameters determined by the Planck satellite are assumed. Furthermore, we found the marginalized parameter constraints of $\Omega\_m = 0.24^{+0.06}\_{-0.04}$ and $\sigma\_8 = 1.13^{+0.43}\_{-0.24}$. The full 2D posterior is consistent, for example, with the Planck cosmology within the 68% confidence region.

2025-04-10, **Axion dark matter search from terrestrial magnetic fields at extremely low frequencies**, Atsushi Nishizawa et.al., [2504.07559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07559v1)

 The natural environment of the Earth can act as a sensitive detector for dark matter in ultralight axions. When axions with masses between $1\times10^{-15}\,{\rm eV}$ and $1\times10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ pass through the Earth, they interact with the global geomagnetic field, generating electromagnetic (EM) waves in the extremely low-frequency range ($0.3$--$30\,{\rm Hz}$) through axion-photon coupling. This paper is one of a series of companion papers for~\cite{Taruya:2025zql}, focusing on the data analysis method and search results for an axion signal. Utilizing the theoretical predictions of axion-induced EM spectra from a companion study, we analyzed long-term observational data of terrestrial magnetic fields in this frequency band to search for axion-induced signals. Our analysis identified 65 persistent signal candidates with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3. Aside from these candidates, we placed a new upper bound on the axion-photon coupling parameter, significantly refining the previous constraint from CAST by at most two orders of magnitude down to $g\_{a\gamma} \lesssim 4\times10^{-13} \,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for the axion mass around $3 \times 10^{-14}\,{\rm eV}$.

2025-04-10, **Gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes orbiting solar-type stars**, Vitorio A. De Lorenci et.al., [2504.07517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07517v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses between $10^{14}$ and $10^{20}$ kg are candidates to contribute a substantial fraction of the total dark matter abundance. When in orbit around the center of a star, which can possibly be a completely interior orbit, such objects would emit gravitational waves, as predicted by general relativity. In this work, we examine the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects when they orbit typical stars, such as the Sun. We show that the magnitude of the waves that could eventually be detected on Earth from a possible PBH orbiting the Sun or a neighboring Sun-like star within our galaxy can be significantly stronger than those originating from a PBH orbiting a denser but more distant neutron star (NS). Such signals may be detectable by the LISA gravitational-wave detector. In addition, we estimate the contribution that a large collection of such PBH-star systems would make to the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) within a range of frequencies to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive.

2025-04-10, **Galaxy and halo properties around cosmic filaments from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 and the ELUCID simulation**, Youcai Zhang et.al., [2504.07367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07367v1)

 Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) along with haloes from the dark matter only constrained ELUCID (Exploring the Local Universe with the reConstructed Initial Density field) simulation, we examine the properties of galaxies and haloes with respect to their distance to cosmic filaments, determined by the medial-axis thinning technique of the COsmic Web Skeleton (COWS) method. Our findings suggest that galaxies or subhaloes grow in mass as they approach these filaments. Galaxies exhibit a redder colour and diminished specific star formation rates as they approach these filaments. Additionally, older subhaloes tend to be more common near the central regions of these filaments. Elliptical galaxies are more frequently found than spiral galaxies in the central regions of the filaments. Lower-mass galaxies typically display reduced sizes in proximity to filaments, whereas higher-mass galaxies tend to exhibit increased sizes when close to filaments. Moreover, the concentration and spin of the haloes grow as they approach the filaments. These findings support the notion that the large-scale structure of the universe, characterized by cosmic web structures, plays a vital role in shaping galaxy and halo properties.

2025-04-10, **What it takes to solve the Hubble tension through scale-dependent modifications of the primordial power spectrum**, Nanoom Lee et.al., [2504.07966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07966v1)

 We investigate scale-dependent modifications to the primordial scalar power spectrum as potential solutions to the Hubble tension. We use the Fisher-bias formalism, recently adapted to examine perturbed recombination solutions to the Hubble tension, and extend its range of validity with an iterative method. We first analyze the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data, demonstrating the existence of modifications to the primordial power spectrum capable of fully resolving the tension between Planck and SH0ES. As a proof of concept, we interpret these solutions in terms of small, time-dependent variations in the first slow roll parameter or in the sound speed of curvature perturbations during a stage of primordial inflation. However, these solutions are associated with a low total matter density $\Omega\_m$, which makes them inconsistent with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and uncalibrated supernovae (SNIa) data. When incorporating additional BOSS and PantheonPlus data, the solutions that reduce the Hubble tension tend to overfit Planck CMB data to compensate for the worsened fit to BAO and SNIa data, making them less compelling. These findings suggest that modifying the primordial power spectrum alone is unlikely to provide a robust resolution to the tension and highlight how the viability of such data-driven solutions depends on the specific datasets considered, emphasizing the role of future high-precision observations in further constraining possible resolutions to the tension.
