2025-09-10, **Two-particle two-hole excitations in semi-inclusive neutrino-nucleus scattering**, Valerio Belocchi et.al., [2509.08786v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08786v1)

 A calculation of the two-particle two-hole contribution to the semi-inclusive $(\nu\_\mu,\mu^-N)$ cross section on carbon is performed in the framework of the relativistic Fermi gas model. The process is driven by meson-exchange currents encompassing all contributions involving the exchange of a single pion and the excitation of a $\Delta$ resonance. The calculation is validated against the inclusive $(\nu\_\mu,\mu^-)$ response functions already existing in the literature, and then extended for the first time to the semi-inclusive channel. Results are presented both at fixed neutrino energy and folded with the T2K neutrino flux.

2025-09-10, **Adapting Vision-Language Models for Neutrino Event Classification in High-Energy Physics**, Dikshant Sagar et.al., [2509.08461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08461v1)

 Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa 3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events. Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

2025-09-10, **Neutrino mass and mixing, resonant leptogenesis and charged lepton flavor violation in a minimal seesaw model with $S_4$ symmetry**, V. V. Vien et.al., [2509.08290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08290v1)

 We propose a minimal inverse seesaw model with $S\_4$ symmetry for the Majorana neutrinos with only one real ($m\_0$)-and two complex ($\alpha, \beta$) parameters in neutrino sector which gives reasonable predictions for the neutrino oscillation parameters, the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe and the charged lepton flavor violation. The resulting model reveals a favor for normal neutrino mass ordering, a higher octant of $\theta\_{23}$ and a lower half-plane of Dirac CP violation phase. The predictions of the model for sum of neutrino masses and the effective Majorana neutrino mass are centered around 58.98 meV and 6.2 meV, respectively. The model also provides the predictions of the baryon asymmetry and charged lepton flavour violation processes which are consistent with the experimental observations.

2025-09-09, **Affleck-Dine Leptoflavorgenesis**, Kensuke Akita et.al., [2509.08175v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08175v1)

 We propose a scenario to produce large primordial lepton flavor asymmetries with vanishing total lepton asymmetry, based on the Affleck-Dine mechanism with Q-ball formation. This scenario can produce large lepton flavor asymmetries while automatically maintaining the vanishing total lepton number without fine-tuning, evading the current BBN and the CMB constraints by neutrino oscillations at MeV temperature. The asymmetries can be produced at cosmic temperatures of $T\gtrsim 1\ {\rm GeV}$, early enough to have broad impacts from the early Universe to the present cosmology. This scenario could affect various aspects of early Universe cosmology simultaneously or separately: (i) explaining the observed baryon asymmetry by the same origin as the lepton flavor asymmetries, (ii) affecting the nature of the QCD transition, (iii) opening up a new parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter by enhancing their production, and (iv) altering the abundance of the light elements, in particular, resolving the recently reported helium-4 anomaly.

2025-09-09, **Acceleration of Heavy Ions at Non-Relativistic Collisionless Shocks**, Damiano Caprioli et.al., [2509.08061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08061v1)

 We investigate the process of Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) of particles with mass number to charge number ratios $A/Q > 1$, e.g., partially-ionized heavy ions. To this end, we introduce helium- and carbon-like ions at solar abundances into two-dimensional hybrid (kinetic ions--fluid electrons) simulations of non-relativistic collisionless shocks. This study yields three main results: 1) Heavy ions are preferentially accelerated compared to hydrogen. For typical solar abundances, the energy transferred to accelerated helium ions is comparable to, or even exceeds, that of hydrogen, thereby enhancing the overall shock acceleration efficiency. 2) Accelerated helium ions contribute to magnetic field amplification, which increases the maximum attainable particle energy and steepen the spectra of accelerated particles. 3) The efficient acceleration of helium significantly enhances the production of hadronic gamma rays and neutrinos, likely dominating the one due to hydrogen. These effects should be taken into account, especially when modeling strong space and astrophysical shocks.

2025-09-09, **Fiducial-Cosmology-dependent systematics for the DESI 2024 Full-Shape Analysis**, R. Gsponer et.al., [2509.08057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08057v1)

 We assess the impact of the fiducial cosmology choice on cosmological inference from full-shape (FS) fits of the galaxy power spectrum in the DESI 2024 Data Release 1 (DR1). Using a suite of AbacusSummit DR1 mock catalogues based on the Planck 2018 best-fit cosmology, we quantify potential systematic shifts introduced by analysing the data under five secondary cosmologies - featuring variations in matter density, thawing dark energy, higher effective number of neutrino species, reduced clustering amplitude, and the DESI DR1 BAO best-fit $w\_0w\_a$CDM cosmology - relative to DESI's baseline Planck 2018 cosmology. We investigate two complementary FS analysis approaches: full-modelling (FM) and ShapeFit (SF), each with distinct sensitivities to the assumed fiducial model. Across all tracers, we find for FM that systematic shifts induced by fiducial cosmology mismatches remain well below the DESI DR1 statistical uncertainties, with maximum deviations of 0.22$\sigma\_\mathrm{DR1}$ in $\Lambda$CDM scenarios and 0.12$\sigma\_\mathrm{DR1+SN}$ when including SN Ia mock data in extended $w\_0w\_a$CDM fits. For SF, the shifts in the compressed parameters remain below $0.45\sigma\_\mathrm{DR1}$ for all tracers and cosmologies.

2025-09-09, **Lepton flavor violating decays of Higgs boson in the NB-LSSM**, Cai Guo et.al., [2509.07902v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07902v1)

 Lepton flavor violation (LFV) represents a clear new physics (NP) signal beyond the standard model (SM). NB-LSSM, the next to minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM with local B-L gauge symmetry, includes three Higgs singlets and three generations of right-handed neutrinos in the basis of MSSM, motivated by the new definition of SM-like Higgs resultly from the introducing of three Higgs singlets which mix with the two Higgs doublets at the tree level in the NB-LSSM. We calculate LFV processes $h\rightarrow l\_i l\_j$ in the mass eigenstate basis and the electroweak interaction basis separately, and the latter adopts the mass insertion approximation (MIA) method. In the suitable parameter space, we obtain the reasonable numerical results. At the same time, the corresponding constraints from the LFV rare decays $l\_j\rightarrow l\_i\gamma$ are considered to analyze the numerical results.

2025-09-09, **Oscillation-Independent Probes of Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions from Supernovae**, Angela R. Beatty et.al., [2509.07856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07856v1)

 We introduce the first oscillation-independent astrophysical method to probe non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in core-collapse supernovae. Using a self-consistent treatment of NSI effects in both supernova neutrino emission simulations and flavor independent neutral-current scattering in detectors, we show that anti-correlated coincidence signatures between liquid scintillator experiments such as JUNO and dark matter detectors such as DARWIN/XLZD, ARGO, or RES-NOVA break degeneracy between NSI and flavor conversions effects. For a Galactic supernova within $\lesssim1$ kpc this approach enables independent probes of neutrino-quark NSI couplings in parameter space overlapping and extending beyond existing terrestrial limits. Our results establish a novel oscillation-independent avenue to test fundamental neutrino interactions in extreme astrophysical environments.

2025-09-09, **Measurement of muon neutrino induced charged current interactions without charged pions in the final state using a new T2K off-axis near detector WAGASCI-BabyMIND**, K. Abe et.al., [2509.07814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07814v1)

 We report a flux-integrated cross section measurement of muon neutrino interactions on water and hydrocarbon via charged current reactions without charged pions in the final state with the WAGASCI-BabyMIND detector which was installed in the T2K near detector hall in 2018. The detector is located 1.5$^\circ$ off-axis and is exposed to a more energetic neutrino flux than ND280, another T2K near detector, which is located at a different off-axis position. The total flux-integrated cross section is measured to be $1.26 \pm 0.18\,(stat.+syst.) \times 10^{-39} $ $\mathrm{cm^{2}/nucleon}$ on CH and $1.44 \pm 0.21\,(stat.+syst.) \times 10^{-39} $ $\mathrm{cm^{2}/nucleon}$ on H$\_{2}$O. These results are compared to model predictions provided by the NEUT v5.3.2 and GENIE v2.8.0 MC generators and the measurements are compatible with these models. Differential cross sections in muon momentum and cosine of the muon scattering angle are also reported. This is the first such measurement reported with the WAGASCI-BabyMIND detector and utilizes the 2020 and 2021 datasets.

2025-09-09, **Towards mono-energetic virtual $ν$ beam cross-section measurements: A feasibility study of $ν$-Ar interaction analysis with DUNE-PRISM**, DUNE Collaboration et.al., [2509.07664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07664v1)

 Neutrino-nucleus cross-section measurements are critical for future neutrino oscillation analyses. However, our models to describe them require further refinement, and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is essential for future neutrino oscillation experiments to realize their ambitious physics goals. Current neutrino cross-section measurements provide clear deficiencies in neutrino interaction modeling, but almost all are reported averaged over broad neutrino fluxes, rendering their interpretation challenging. Using the DUNE-PRISM concept (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment Precision Reaction Independent Spectrum Measurement) -- a movable near detector that samples multiple off-axis positions -- neutrino interaction measurements can be used to construct narrow virtual fluxes (less than 100 MeV wide). These fluxes can be used to extract charged-current neutrino-nucleus cross sections as functions of outgoing lepton kinematics within specific neutrino energy ranges. Based on a dedicated simulation with realistic event statistics and flux-related systematic uncertainties, but assuming an almost-perfect detector, we run a feasibility study demonstrating how DUNE-PRISM data can be used to measure muon neutrino charged-current integrated and differential cross sections over narrow fluxes. We find that this approach enables a model independent reconstruction of powerful observables, including energy transfer, typically accessible only in electron scattering measurements, but that large exposures may be required for differential cross-section measurements with few-\% statistical uncertainties.

2025-09-09, **Indirect dark matter searches with neutrino telescopes via energetic cosmic showers**, Arindam Basu et.al., [2509.07570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07570v1)

 We explore the possibility that the high energy neutrino flux observed by terrestrial telescopes originates from dark matter (DM) annihilation. Specifically, we study a minimal, UV-complete $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model with a Dirac DM candidate, whose annihilation into neutrinos proceeds exclusively through a $Z^\prime$ boson. By computing the annihilation cross section and comparing with the observed flux, we derive bounds on the model parameters. Additional constraints are obtained within the freeze-in framework, where the observed relic abundance is reproduced, leading to the strongest bounds. Considering cosmic string vibrations as a source of gravitational waves, we further constrain the vacuum expectation value of the $U(1)$ breaking. All results are contrasted with perturbativity limits and existing constraints from low- and high-energy experiments.

2025-09-10, **Parity Violation in Galaxy Shapes: Primordial Non-Gaussianity**, Toshiki Kurita et.al., [2509.08787v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08787v1)

 We present a comprehensive study of galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA) as a probe of parity-violating primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we show that the parity-odd IA power spectrum is sensitive to the collapsed limit of the parity-odd primordial trispectrum. For a $U(1)$-gauge inflationary model, the IA power spectrum is proportional to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation, $P\_\zeta(k) \propto k^{-3}$. However, the proportionality constants contain not only the PNG amplitude but also undetermined EFT bias parameters. We use $N$-body simulations to determine the bias parameters for dark matter halos. Using these bias parameters, we forecast IA's constraining power, assuming data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that the IA power spectrum can improve the current limits on the amplitude of parity-violating PNG derived from galaxy four-point correlation and CMB trispectrum analyses. Moreover, galaxy shapes are complementary to these probes as they are sensitive to different scales and trispectrum configurations. Beyond galaxy shapes, we develop a new method to generate initial conditions for simulations and forward models from the parity-odd trispectrum with an enhanced collapsed limit.

2025-09-10, **An improved model for the effect of correlated Si-III absorption on the one-dimensional Lyman-$α$ forest power spectrum**, Ke Ma et.al., [2509.08613v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08613v1)

 We present an analysis of Si-III absorption and its effect on the 1D Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum using the Sherwood-Relics hydrodynamical simulation suite. In addition to the well-understood oscillations arising from the Ly$\alpha$--Si-III cross correlation, we find an enhancement in small-scale power that has been ignored in previous studies. We therefore develop a new analytical fitting function that captures two critical effects that have previously been neglected: distinct Ly$\alpha$ and Si-III line profiles, and a variable ratio for coeval Ly$\alpha$ and Si-III optical depths. In contrast to earlier work, we also predict amplitudes for the Si-III power spectrum and Ly$\alpha$--Si-III cross power spectrum that decrease toward lower redshift due to the hardening metagalactic UV background spectrum at $z\lesssim 3.5$. The fitting function is validated by comparison against multiple simulated datasets at redshifts $2.2\leq z \leq 5.0$ and wavenumbers $k < 0.2\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$. Our model remains in good agreement with earlier work at large scales ($k \lesssim 0.06\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$) and it has little effect on existing warm dark matter constraints from the Ly$\alpha$ forest when adopting a physically motivated prior on the silicon abundance. It will, however, be an essential consideration for future, high-precision Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum measurements.

2025-09-10, **Gravitational radiation reaction around a static black hole surrounded by a Dehnen type dark matter halo**, Amjad Ashoorioon et.al., [2509.08569v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08569v1)

 We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Such a system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the particle's orbit evolves under radiation reaction. We also consider the effects of dynamical friction and accretion of DM on the orbital parameters. We find that the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum decrease faster with respect to the case in which EMRI is in empty spacetime.

2025-09-10, **Search for a photon peak from keV-scale dark matter annihilation with NuSTAR: Constraints on $\langle σv \rangle$ after 11 years of observations**, E. I. Zakharov et.al., [2509.08506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08506v1)

 We report new constraints on the velocity-independent annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ of keV-scale dark matter particles based on 11 years of observations with the NuSTAR X-ray telescope. Using the unfocused stray light mode of the instrument, which provides a wide field-of-view and a stable instrumental background, we perform a sensitive search for photon signatures from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic halo. We model the resulting diffuse X-ray spectrum over the 3-20 keV energy range and search for line-like spectral features that may arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles into photons. No statistically significant excess over the expected astrophysical background is found. We therefore place upper limits on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ as a function of dark matter mass, assuming a velocity-independent s-wave annihilation and several Galactic dark matter profiles. Across most of the explored mass range our results provide the strongest X-ray constraints to date, reaching the level of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \lesssim 10^{-33}$ -- $10^{-34}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and they are complementary to the most recent bounds derived from SRG/ART-XC observations.

2025-09-10, **Matter power spectrum reconstruction with KiDS-Legacy: Improved internal $Λ$CDM consistency and preference for strong baryonic feedback**, Jeger C. Broxterman et.al., [2509.08365v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08365v1)

 Direct measurements of the matter power spectrum, $P\_\mathrm{m}(k,z)$, provide a powerful tool to investigate observed tensions between models of structure growth while also testing the internal consistency of cosmological probes. We analyse cosmic shear data from the final data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), presenting a deprojected $P\_\mathrm{m}(k,z)$, measured in up to three redshift bins. Compared to analyses using previous KiDS releases, we find improved internal consistency in the $z\lesssim0.7$ regime. At large scales, $k\lesssim0.1\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$, our power spectrum reconstruction aligns with $\Lambda$CDM predictions with a density fluctuation amplitude $\sigma\_8=0.81$. Furthermore, at small scales, $k=3$-$20\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the average matter power spectrum is suppressed by $30\%\pm10\%\,{\rm (stat.)}\pm4\%\,{\rm (sys.)}$ with $2.8\sigma$ significance relative to a dark-matter-only model, consistent with expectations of strong baryonic feedback.

2025-09-10, **Multiverse Predictions for Habitability: Fundamental Physics and Galactic Habitability**, McCullen Sandora et.al., [2509.08220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08220v1)

 In the multiverse hypothesis, a range of universes exist with differing values of our physical constants. Here, we investigate how the probabilities of observing our values of these constants depend on the assumptions made about the theories governing particle physics and cosmology, along with habitability. The particle physics effects we consider include constraints on the Higgs vacuum expectation value from big bang nucleosynthesis and supernovae, grand unified theories (GUTs), and standard model stability. Cosmology effects we consider are different theories of dark matter and baryogenesis, and for galactic habitability effects we include star formation efficiency, stellar encounters, supernova explosions, and active galactic nuclei. We find the following to be disfavored in the multiverse scenario: flexible GUTs, pessimistic galactic disruption rates, some origin of life theories, and freeze-out dark matter with high energy baryogenesis. These predictions can be tested in future experiments to either confirm or rule out the multiverse.

2025-09-09, **Constraining Effective Field Theories for dark matter candidates annihilating into gamma-ray lines with CTAO**, Lucia Angel et.al., [2509.08050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08050v1)

 Gamma-ray lines constitute a smoking gun signature for annihilating dark matter particles. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes and satellites have searched for such signals but null results have been reported thus far. We take advantage of the expected gamma-ray flux sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) toward the direction of the Galactic Centre and Dwarf Galaxies and its exquisite energy resolution to derive upper limits on fermionic and scalar dark matter annihilations into gamma-ray lines. We consider the lowest-order effective operators for scalar and fermion dark matter, and derive limits on the energy scale using the recent CTAO projected sensitivity. Putting our findings into perspective with existing limits from direct and indirect detection experiments, we conclude that CTAO will either play a complementary role or be a discovery channel for dark matter signals.

2025-09-09, **Testing Viability of Benchmark Dark Matter Models for the Galactic Center Excess**, Yongao Hu et.al., [2509.08043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08043v1)

 We examine the status of benchmark simplified dark matter models that have been proposed to explain the GeV gamma-ray Galactic Center excess. We constrain the available parameter space using updated observations from indirect detection, cosmology, direct detection, and accelerators. We show that there is still unconstrained parameter space in both classes of models we consider (a secluded dark sector with a vector portal coupling, and a two-Higgs doublet with a pseudoscalar mediator), and discuss the prospects for potential improvement of these constraints in future experiments.

2025-09-09, **Breaking Dark: Hunting Heavy Decaying Dark Matter with Tibet AS$_γ$ and LHAASO-KM2A**, Abhishek Dubey et.al., [2509.08039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08039v1)

 Recent measurements of diffuse sub-PeV gamma-rays by the Tibet AS$\_\gamma$ and LHAASO collaborations have reshaped our understanding of the gamma-ray sky. Besides uncovering the nature of `PeVatrons', these measurements can also be used to probe the non-gravitational nature of dark matter. PeV-scale decaying dark matter can produce high-energy gamma rays in the final state and contribute to the measurements made by extensive air-shower detectors like Tibet AS$\_\gamma$ and LHAASO. Using the latest Tibet AS$\_\gamma$ upper limits on diffuse gamma rays away from the Galactic plane and the LHAASO-KM2A measurements of diffuse gamma rays from the Galactic plane, we put stringent constraints on lifetimes of decaying DM for masses $\sim 10^6 - 10^9$ GeV. Future observations of high-energy diffuse gamma-ray emission can thus provide stronger limits or potentially discover heavy decaying dark matter.

2025-09-09, **LHAASO Galactic Plane $γ$-rays Strongly Constrain Heavy Dark Matter**, Celine Boehm et.al., [2509.07982v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07982v1)

 LHAASO, a ground-based observatory, is unveiling new frontiers in our understanding of high-energy $\gamma-$rays and cosmic rays. It has recently observed high energy diffuse $\gamma-$rays from the Galactic plane in the TeV-PeV range. For the first time, we analyze this data to search for signatures of heavy decaying and annihilating dark matter in the mass range $10^{5}-10^{11}$ GeV. We compute the expected photon flux from both Galactic and extragalactic dark matter, incorporating attenuation due to photon pair production. For the Galactic contribution, we include both prompt photons and secondary photons produced via inverse Compton scattering, accounting for electron/positron propagation. For the extragalactic component, in addition to the prompt and inverse Compton contributions, we also include cascade photons arising from inverse Compton scattering of pair-produced electrons and positrons. By combining all these contributions, we derive constraints on the dark matter parameter space. Our bounds for various two body Standard Model final states are strongest to date. This underscore LHAASO's capability to discover the nature of heavy dark matter.

2025-09-09, **A dense dark matter core of the subhalo in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666**, Lei Lei et.al., [2509.07808v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07808v1)

 The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m\_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}\_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r\_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho\_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M\_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.

2025-09-09, **A comprehensive separation of dark matter and baryonic mass components in galaxy clusters II: an overview of the mass distribution in Abell S1063**, Benjamin Beauchesne et.al., [2509.07777v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07777v1)

 In the first paper of this series, we derived mass constraints on the total mass and the baryonic components of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063. The main focus was to recover stellar masses and kinematics for cluster members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). In this second paper, we introduce a multi-probe mass modelling approach that incorporates constraints on both the total mass and the individual baryonic components. We obtain comprehensive mass models of Abell S1063, in which the dark matter distribution is disentangled from the baryonic mass at both cluster and galaxy scales. The best-fitting mass model achieves an RMS of $0.50"$ on the multiple image positions. The kinematic profiles of the BCG \& ICL, as well as the X-ray surface brightness of the intra-cluster gas, are accurately reproduced within observational uncertainties. However, a $35~\mathrm{km/s}$ scatter is required for the cluster member line-of-sight dispersions. This method yields the most complex parametric mass model with consistency among almost all available mass constraints. We find a $1\sigma$ agreement between the inferred stellar-to-subhalo mass relation and that predicted by large-scale cosmological simulations. The ICL stellar mass derived from our model is consistent with estimates from stellar population modelling. We present the first multi-probe mass modelling method capable of disentangling the dark matter from the baryonic mass distributions in massive galaxy clusters. Its results, such as the stellar-to-subhalo mass relation or the distribution of each mass component, can be directly compared to hydrodynamical cosmological simulations such as illustrisTNG.

2025-09-09, **Illuminating dark matter admixed in neutron stars with simultaneous mass-radius constraints**, Nai-Bo Zhang et.al., [2509.07767v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07767v1)

 We investigate how simultaneous mass and radius measurements of massive neutron stars (NSs) can help constrain properties of dark matter (DM) possibly admixed in them. Within a fermionic DM model that interacts only through gravitation, along with a well-constrained nuclear matter equation of state, we show that the simultaneous mass and radius measurement of PSRJ0740+6620 reduces the uncertainty of DM central energy density by more than 50\% compared to the results obtained from using the two observables independently, while other DM parameters remain unconstrained. Additionally, we find that the DM fraction $f\_D$ should be smaller than 2\% when constrained by the observed NS maximum mass alone, and it could be even smaller than 0.3\% with the simultaneous measurement of mass and radius, supporting the conclusion that only a small amount of DM exists in DM admixed neutron stars (DANS).

2025-09-09, **A comprehensive separation of dark matter and baryonic mass components in galaxy clusters I: Mass constraints from Abell S1063**, Benjamin Beauchesne et.al., [2509.07762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07762v1)

 In this two-part series, we present a multi-probe mass modelling method for massive galaxy clusters, designed to disentangle the contributions of individual mass components (Dark matter, intra-cluster gas, stellar masses). In this first paper, we focus on recovering the mass constraint datasets required for the modelling approach introduced in the second paper. Specifically, we measure the light distribution, stellar mass, and kinematics of the cluster members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the intra-cluster light (ICL) in Abell S1063. To that end, we developed a new method to extract the light profiles of the cluster members, BCG, and ICL, while accounting for contamination from nearby foreground and background galaxies in \textsc{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) imaging. We obtained light profiles for $289$ cluster members using a dual Pseudo-Isothermal Elliptical (dPIE) model based on the HST F160W filter, while the BCG \& ICL is modelled as a single component using a multi-Gaussian expansion. To estimate stellar masses and velocity dispersions, we rely on multi-band HST photometry and \textsc{VLT/MUSE} integral field spectroscopy, respectively. Stellar masses are derived using three different spectral energy distribution (SED) models. We measure the line-of-sight velocity dispersions of the cluster members at their half-light radii, as determined from their light profiles, while for the BCG \& ICL components, we use elliptical annular apertures. Thanks to these measurements, we will be able to constrain the cluster stellar mass content, which is detailed in the second paper of the series. We publicly release these measurements with intermediary data products.

2025-09-09, **Cosmological simulations of the same spiral galaxy: satellite properties, the role of baryonic physics and star formation history in shaping dark matter cores/cusps**, A. Nuñez-Castiñeyra et.al., [2509.07470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07470v1)

 We investigate the role of baryonic physics in shaping the population, structure, and internal dynamics of galactic subhalos using the Mochima suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. A refined method is developed to identify bound subhalo material by isolating the local gravitational potential and applying multi-criteria phase-space selection. This approach enables a robust characterisation of subhalo properties across five baryonic runs with varying prescriptions for star formation, and supernova and protostellar feedback, as well as a dark matter-only baseline. At the population level, we find that host halo concentration, modulated by baryonic feedback, is a key predictor of subhalo survival. Subhalos with more massive stellar components exhibit deeper internal potentials and enhanced resilience to tidal disruption. At the structural level, we identify a broad diversity in inner dark matter profiles, consistent with observations of dwarf galaxies. We show that this diversity correlates with both star formation history and environmental interaction. In particular, galaxies that form most of their stars early tend to retain steep cusps, while those with extended or recent star formation exhibit oscillating inner slopes shaped by bursty feedback and tidal perturbations. These findings suggest that the so-called "diversity problem" may reflect the complex interplay between feedback history and gravitational environment, rather than a breakdown of cold dark matter predictions.

 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off $<55{\rm M}\_\odot$, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, $\sim 60-130{\rm M}\_\odot$, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range $\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\sim 10^6{\rm M}\_\odot$ and size $\sim 1{\rm pc}$. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as $\sim 10^2-10^3{\rm M}\_\odot$.

 The escape of accelerated particles from supernova remnants remains one of the central and yet least understood aspects of the origin of cosmic rays. Here we use the results of the recent LHAASO observation of gamma rays from a region of $\sim 2$ degrees around the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant to constrain the process of particle escape from this remnant. We dedicate special attention to discuss the impact of shock evolution and particle propagation in the near source region on the gamma ray emission. This is very important to assess the possibility that very high-energy protons may have been accelerated in past activity of Cas A. Given the core collapse nature of Cas A and its young age ($\sim 340$ years), the non detection of $\gtrsim 100$ TeV gamma rays from this remnant allows us to draw some conclusions on the role of supernova explosions for the origin of cosmic rays at the knee. In particular we calculate the spectrum of cosmic rays that may have escaped this remnant to make a clear distinction between the instantaneous maximum energy and the one that appears as a flux suppression in the time integrated spectrum from an individual supernova. LHAASO observation of the region around Cas A as well as gamma ray observations of the remnant itself confirm that this remnant is not operating as a PeVatron and that, although in the early stages the maximum energy may have reached $\sim$Peta-electronVolt, the number of such particles in the surroundings of Cas A is exceedingly small.

2025-09-10, **Unsupervised machine learning classification of gamma-ray bursts based on the rest-frame prompt emission parameters**, Si-Yuan Zhu et.al., [2509.08224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08224v1)

 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to originate from two distinct progenitors, compact binary mergers and massive collapsars. Traditional and some recent machine learning-based classification schemes predominantly rely on observer-frame physical parameters, which are significantly affected by the redshift effects and may not accurately represent the intrinsic properties of GRBs. In particular, the progenitors usually could only be decided by successful detection of the multi-band long-term afterglow, which could easily cost days of devoted effort from multiple global observational utilities. In this work, we apply the unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms called t-SNE and UMAP to perform GRB classification based on rest-frame prompt emission parameters. The map results of both t-SNE and UMAP reveal a clear division of these GRBs into two clusters, denoted as GRBs-I and GRBs-II. We find that all supernova-associated GRBs, including the atypical short-duration burst GRB 200826A (now recognized as collapsar-origin), consistently fall within the GRBs-II category. Conversely, all kilonova-associated GRBs (except for two controversial events) are classified as GRBs-I, including the peculiar long-duration burst GRB 060614 originating from a merger event. In another words, this clear ML separation of two types of GRBs based only on prompt properties could correctly predict the results of progenitors without follow-up afterglow properties. Comparative analysis with conventional classification methods using $T\_{90}$ and $E\_{\rm p,z}$--$E\_{\rm iso}$ correlation demonstrates that our machine learning approach provides superior discriminative power, particularly in resolving ambiguous cases of hybrid GRBs.

2025-09-10, **Multiverse Predictions for Habitability: Fundamental Physics and Galactic Habitability**, McCullen Sandora et.al., [2509.08220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08220v1)

 In the multiverse hypothesis, a range of universes exist with differing values of our physical constants. Here, we investigate how the probabilities of observing our values of these constants depend on the assumptions made about the theories governing particle physics and cosmology, along with habitability. The particle physics effects we consider include constraints on the Higgs vacuum expectation value from big bang nucleosynthesis and supernovae, grand unified theories (GUTs), and standard model stability. Cosmology effects we consider are different theories of dark matter and baryogenesis, and for galactic habitability effects we include star formation efficiency, stellar encounters, supernova explosions, and active galactic nuclei. We find the following to be disfavored in the multiverse scenario: flexible GUTs, pessimistic galactic disruption rates, some origin of life theories, and freeze-out dark matter with high energy baryogenesis. These predictions can be tested in future experiments to either confirm or rule out the multiverse.

2025-09-09, **X-ray Transmission Through Photoionized Gas with Moderate Thomson Optical Depth**, Taya Govreen-Segal et.al., [2509.08119v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08119v1)

 We model the absorption of X-rays by gas obscuring the source and photoionized by it. We consider a broad range of column densities, including both Thomson-thin and Thomson-thick media. For the Thomson thin regime, we derive a simple criterion, based on the source luminosity and spectrum and the medium radius and column density, that distinguish between the following cases: (i) The absorption can be modeled well by a neutral medium; (ii) The radiation ionizes its way through the medium and no absorption is expected; and (iii) A detailed model is required because the column density inferred from modeling the absorption with a neutral gas is much lower than the actual column density, or because the absorption features cannot be fitted by a neutral absorber. We derive the criterion analytically using a toy model of hydrogen and oxygen, and calibrate it for realistic compositions with metallicities in the range $Z/Z\_{\odot}=0.01-50$, using CLOUDY. We generalize the model to the Thomson-thick regime, where we consider, alongside photoabsorption, electron scattering, Compton heating, Comptonization, and photon degradation. In this case, the emergent spectrum depends on the boundary condition experienced by photons scattered back towards the source. We discuss the effect of a reflective boundary and a reprocessing boundary. We provide simple criteria for the expected absorption state, and discuss additional effects that alter the spectrum. The main motivation of our modeling is X-ray emission from supernovae interacting with circumstellar medium; however, we expect it to be useful to many other applications.

2025-09-09, **Lense-Thirring precessing magnetar engine drives a superluminous supernova**, Joseph R. Farah et.al., [2509.08051v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08051v1)

 Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) are at least an order of magnitude brighter than standard supernovae, with the internal power source for their luminosity still unknown. The central engines of SLSNe-I are hypothesized to be magnetars, but the majority of SLSNe-I light curves have multiple bumps or peaks that are unexplained by the standard magnetar model. Existing explanations for the bumps either modulate the central engine luminosity or invoke interactions with material in the circumstellar environment. Systematic surveys of the limited sample of SLSNe-I light curves find no compelling evidence favoring either scenario, leaving both the nature of the light-curve fluctuations and the applicability of the magnetar model unresolved. Here, we report high-cadence multiband observations of an SLSN-I with clear "chirped" (i.e., decreasing period) light-curve bumps that can be directly linked to the properties of the magnetar central engine. Our observations are consistent with a tilted, infalling accretion disk undergoing Lense-Thirring precession around a magnetar centrally located within the expanding supernova ejecta. Our model demonstrates that the overall light curve and bump frequency independently and self-consistently constrain the spin period and the magnetic field strength of the magnetar. Assuming standard accretion disk parameters, we constrain the accretion rate onto the magnetar. Our results provide the first observational evidence of the Lense-Thirring effect in the environment of a magnetar, and confirm the magnetar spin-down model as an explanation for the extreme luminosity observed in SLSNe-I. We anticipate this discovery will create avenues for testing general relativity in a new regime -- the violent centers of young supernovae.

2025-09-09, **Dynamical Dark Energy or Modified Gravity? Signatures in Gravitational Wave Propagation**, Purnendu Karmakar et.al., [2509.07976v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07976v1)

 We discuss the implications of the most recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) DR2 and DESyr5 compilation of supernovae (SNe) datasets for modified gravity focusing on non-metricity based $f(Q)$ theory, by employing a `model-independent' approach. We reconstruct of dark energy density which is then extended to estimate the perturbation-level quantities, sourced by the modified gravity, namely the effective gravitational coupling, $\mu$, and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave propagation, $\nu$. In light of the remarkable hints for a dynamical dark energy emerging from the analysis of background cosmological data, we discuss the possibility to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity scenarios from their scalar and tensor perturbation-level signatures. We contrast our findings between the older Pantheon+ and the newer DESyr5 compilations of SNe datasets, which predict a significant distinct signature in the damping parameter of the gravitational wave propagation amplitude. On the other hand, the prediction for the effective gravitational coupling remains insensitive to the choice of the SNe datasets. Our results provide a strong case for the study of gravitational wave propagation in modified gravity theories, in light of the new generation of gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.

2025-09-09, **Observing Double White Dwarfs with the Lunar GW Antenna**, Giovanni Benetti et.al., [2509.07849v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07849v1)

 The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector that will observe in the decihertz (dHz) frequency region. In this band, binary white dwarf systems are expected to merge, emitting gravitational waves. Detecting this emission opens new perspectives for understanding the Type Ia supernova progenitors and for investigating dense matter physics. In this work, we present the capabilities of LGWA to detect and localize short-period double white dwarfs in terms of sky locations and distances. The analysis is performed using a realistic spatial distribution of sources, merger rates, and binary-mass distributions derived from current population synthesis models. The simulated population of double white dwarfs is generated using the SeBa stellar-evolution code, coupled with dedicated sampling algorithms. The performance of the LGWA detector, both in terms of signal detectability and parameter estimation, is assessed using standard gravitational-wave data analysis techniques, including Fisher matrix methods, as implemented in the GWFish and Legwork codes. The analysis indicates that LGWA could detect approximately O(30) monochromatic galactic sources and O(10) extragalactic mergers, demonstrating the unique potential of decihertz gravitational-wave detectors to access and characterize extragalactic DWD populations. This will open new avenues for understanding Type Ia supernova progenitors and the physics of DWDs.

2025-09-09, **Probing the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation via Non-Parametric Reconstruction for High Redshifts**, Felipe Avila et.al., [2509.07848v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07848v1)

 We test the validity of the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by combining angular diameter distance and luminosity distance measurements from recent cosmological observations. For the angular diameter distance, we use data from transverse baryon acoustic oscillations and galaxy clusters. On the other hand, the luminosity distance is obtained from Type Ia supernovae in the Pantheon+ sample and from quasar catalogs. To reduce the large dispersion in quasar luminosity distances, we apply a selection criterion based on their deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model and implement a binning procedure to suppress statistical noise. We reconstruct the CDDR using Gaussian Processes, a non-parametric supervised machine learning method. Our results show no significant deviation from the CDDR within the $2\sigma$ confidence level across the redshift range explored, supporting its validity even at high redshifts.

2025-09-09, **SN 2022xlp: The second-known well-observed, intermediate-luminosity Iax supernova**, D. Bánhidi et.al., [2509.07717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07717v1)

 We present a detailed analysis of type Iax supernova SN 2022xlp. With a V-band absolute magnitude light curve peaking at $M\_{max}(V) = -16.04 \pm 0.25$ mag, this object is regarded as the second determined well-observed Iax supernova in the intermediate luminosity range after SN 2019muj. Our research aims to explore the question of whether the physical properties vary continuously across the entire luminosity range. We also investigate the chemical abundance profiles and the characteristic physical quantities of the ejecta, followed by tests of the predictions of hydro simulations. The pseudo-bolometric light curve was calculated using optical and UV (Swift UVOT ) light curves and fits with a radiation diffusion Arnett model to constrain the average optical opacity, ejected mass, and initial nickel mass produced in the explosion. We analyzed the color evolution of SN 2022xlp and compared it with that of other Iax supernovae with different peak luminosities. We used the spectral tomography method to determine the radial profiles of physical properties and abundances of the ejecta, comparing them with a set of hydrodynamic pure deflagration models. The estimated bolometric flux peaks at $8.87\times 10^{41}$ erg/s and indicates the production of radioactive nickel as $M(^{56}$Ni) = $0.0215 \pm 0.009\,M\_{\odot}$. According to the best-fit model, the explosion energy is $(2.066 \pm 0.236) \times 10^{49}$ erg and the ejecta mass is $0.142 \pm 0.015\,M\_{\odot}$. The performed spectral tomography analysis shows that the determined physical quantities agree well with the predictions of the deflagration simulations, with modifications regarding the increased Na abundance and the more massive outer layers. SN 2022xlp bridges the previously existing luminosity gap, and supports the assumption of continuous variation in the physical properties across the SN Iax subclass.

2025-09-09, **Cosmological simulations of the same spiral galaxy: satellite properties, the role of baryonic physics and star formation history in shaping dark matter cores/cusps**, A. Nuñez-Castiñeyra et.al., [2509.07470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07470v1)

 We investigate the role of baryonic physics in shaping the population, structure, and internal dynamics of galactic subhalos using the Mochima suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. A refined method is developed to identify bound subhalo material by isolating the local gravitational potential and applying multi-criteria phase-space selection. This approach enables a robust characterisation of subhalo properties across five baryonic runs with varying prescriptions for star formation, and supernova and protostellar feedback, as well as a dark matter-only baseline. At the population level, we find that host halo concentration, modulated by baryonic feedback, is a key predictor of subhalo survival. Subhalos with more massive stellar components exhibit deeper internal potentials and enhanced resilience to tidal disruption. At the structural level, we identify a broad diversity in inner dark matter profiles, consistent with observations of dwarf galaxies. We show that this diversity correlates with both star formation history and environmental interaction. In particular, galaxies that form most of their stars early tend to retain steep cusps, while those with extended or recent star formation exhibit oscillating inner slopes shaped by bursty feedback and tidal perturbations. These findings suggest that the so-called "diversity problem" may reflect the complex interplay between feedback history and gravitational environment, rather than a breakdown of cold dark matter predictions.

2025-09-09, **Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities**, James R. Beattie et.al., [2509.07354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07354v1)

 The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SNe-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that SNRs radiate incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation, localized at the interface where the hot and warm plasma phases mix near the cooling radius. I provide evidence that this process is seeded by a Vishniac (1994)-type instability, which corrugates and folds the interface. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism described and measured in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $\propto k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable SNR layer, can imprint itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale instabilities in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.
