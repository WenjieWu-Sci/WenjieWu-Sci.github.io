2023-06-06, **Potential Constraints to Neutrino-Nucleus Interactions Based on Electron Scattering Data**, V. Pandey et.al., [2306.03896v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03896v1)

 A thorough understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions physics is crucial to achieving precision goals in broader neutrino physics programs. The complexity of nuclei comprising the detectors and limited understanding of their weak response constitutes one of the biggest systematic uncertainties in neutrino experiments - both at intermediate energies affecting the short- and long-baseline neutrino programs as well as at lower energies affecting coherent scattering neutrino programs. While electron and neutrino interactions are different at the primary vertex, many underlying relevant physical processes in the nucleus are the same in both cases, and electron scattering data collected with precisely controlled kinematics, large statistics and high precision allows one to constrain nuclear properties and specific interaction processes. To this end, electron-nucleus scattering experiments provide vital complementary information to test, assess and validate different nuclear models and event generators intended to be used in neutrino experiments. In fact, for many decades, the study of electron scattering off a nucleus has been used as a tool to probe the properties of that nucleus and its electromagnetic response. While previously existing electron scattering data provide important information, new and proposed measurements are tied closely to what is required for the neutrino program in terms of expanding kinematic reach, the addition of relevant nuclei and information on the final states hadronic system.

2023-06-06, **Conformal anomaly and gravitational pair production**, M. N. Chernodub et.al., [2306.03892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03892v1)

 We argue that the rate density of particle pair production $\Gamma$ in background fields in conformal field theories is determined by the conformal anomaly and related to anomalous trace of the energy-momentum tensor as $\Gamma = (\pi/2) \langle T^\mu\_{\ \mu}\rangle$ if the trace is positive (and $\Gamma = 0$ otherwise). This formula perfectly reproduces (presumably, non-Hawking) radiation generated by static gravitational fields in the absence of an event horizon via a new evaporation mechanism suggested recently. Our relation also correctly describes the one-loop Schwinger pair creation in massless (scalar and spinor) quantum electrodynamics. It also accurately points to the Savvidi instability of the gluonic vacuum towards the formation of the chromomagnetic condensate. Photon and neutrino pair production are also discussed.

2023-06-06, **A Scotogenic explanation for the 95 GeV excesses**, Pablo Escribano et.al., [2306.03735v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03735v1)

 Several hints of the presence of a new state at about $95$ GeV have been observed recently. The CMS and ATLAS collaborations have reported excesses in the diphoton channel at about this diphoton invariant mass with local statistical significances of $2.9 \, \sigma$ and $1.7 \,\sigma$, respectively. Furthermore, a $2 \, \sigma$ excess in the $b\bar{b}$ final state was also observed at LEP, again pointing at a similar mass value. We interpret these intriguing hints of new physics in a variant of the Scotogenic model, an economical scenario that induces Majorana neutrino masses at the loop level and includes a viable dark matter candidate. We show that our model can naturally explain the 95 GeV excesses while respecting all experimental constraints and discuss other phenomenological predictions of our scenario.

2023-06-06, **Dispersive determination of neutrino mass orderings**, Hsiang-nan Li et.al., [2306.03463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03463v1)

 We argue that the mixing phenomenon of a neutral meson formed by a fictitious massive quark will disappear, if the electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) is restored at a high energy scale. This disappearance is taken as the high-energy input for the dispersion relation, which must be obeyed by the width difference between two meson mass eigenstates. The solution to the dispersion relation at low energy, i.e., in the symmetry broken phase, then connects the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements to the quark masses involved in the box diagrams responsible for meson mixing. It is demonstrated via the analysis of the $D$ meson mixing that the typical $d$, $s$ and $b$ quark masses demand the CKM matrix elements in agreement with measured values. In particular, the known numerical relation $V\_{us}\approx \sqrt{m\_s/m\_b}$ with the $s$ ($b$) quark mass $m\_s$ ($m\_b$) can be derived analytically from our solution. Next we apply the same formalism to the mixing of the $\mu^- e^+$ and $\mu^+ e^-$ states through similar box diagrams with intermediate neutrino channels. It is shown that the neutrino masses in the normal hierarchy (NH), instead of in the inverted hierarchy or quasi-degenerate spectrum, match the observed Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix elements. The lepton mixing angles larger than the quark ones are explained by means of the inequality $m\_2^2/m\_3^2\gg m\_s^2/m\_b^2$, $m\_{2,3}$ being the neutrino masses in the NH. At last, the solution for the $\tau^-e^+$-$\tau^+e^-$ mixing specifies the mixing angle $\theta\_{23}\approx 45^\circ$ with slight preference for the first octant. Our work suggests that the fermion masses and mixing parameters are constrained dynamically, and the neutrino mass orderings can be discriminated by the internal consistency of the SM.

2023-06-06, **A stacked search for spatial coincidences between IceCube neutrinos and radio pulsars**, Vibhavasu Pasumarti et.al., [2306.03427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03427v1)

 We carry out a stacked search for spatial coincidences between all known radio pulsars and TeV neutrinos from the IceCube 10 year (2008-2018) point source catalog as a followup to our previous work on looking for coincidences with individual pulsars. We consider three different weighting schemes to stack the contribution from individual pulsars. We do not find a statistically significant excess using this method. We report the 95% c.l. differential neutrino flux limit as a function of neutrino energy. We have also made our analysis codes publicly available.

2023-06-05, **The Gallium Anomaly**, Steven R. Elliott et.al., [2306.03299v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03299v1)

 In order to test the end-to-end operations of gallium solar neutrino experiments, intense electron-capture sources were fabricated to measure the responses of the radiochemical SAGE and GALLEX/GNO detectors to known fluxes of low-energy neutrinos. Such tests were viewed at the time as a cross-check, given the many tests of 71Ge recovery and counting that had been routinely performed, with excellent results. However, the four 51Cr and 37Ar source experiments yielded rates below expectations, a result commonly known as the Ga anomaly. As the intensity of the electron-capture sources can be measured to high precision, the neutrino lines they produce are fixed by known atomic and nuclear rates, and the neutrino absorption cross section on 71Ga is tightly constrained by the lifetime of 71Ge, no simple explanation for the anomaly has been found. To check these calibration experiments, a dedicated experiment BEST was performed, utilizing a neutrino source of unprecedented intensity and a detector optimized to increase statistics while providing some information on counting rate as a function of distance from the source. The results BEST obtained are consistent with the earlier solar neutrino calibration experiments, and when combined with those measurements, yield a Ga anomaly with a significance of approximately 4sigma, under conservative assumptions. But BEST found no evidence of distance dependence and thus no explicit indication of new physics. In this review we describe the extensive campaigns carried out by SAGE, GALLEX/GNO, and BEST to demonstrate the reliability and precision of their experimental procedures, including 71Ge recovery, counting, and analysis. We also describe efforts to define uncertainties in the neutrino capture cross section. With the results from BEST, an anomaly remains.

2023-06-05, **Calculations of the binding-energy differences for highly-charged Ho and Dy ions**, I. M. Savelyev et.al., [2306.03176v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03176v1)

 The binding-energy differences for $^{163}\mathrm{Ho}^{q+}$ and $^{163}\mathrm{Dy}^{q+}$ ions with ionization degrees $q = 38$, $39$, and $40$ are calculated. The calculations are performed using the large-scale relativistic configuration-interaction and relativistic coupled-clusters methods. The contributions from quantum-electrodynamics, nuclear-recoil, and frequency-dependent Breit-interaction effects are taken into account. The final uncertainty does not exceed $1$ eV. Combining the obtained results with the binding-energy difference for neutral atoms calculated in [Savelyev et al., Phys. Rev. A 105, 012806 (2022)], we get the secondary differences of the ion-atom binding energies. These values can be used to evaluate the amount of energy released in the electron capture process in $^{163}\mathrm{Ho}$ atom (the $Q$ value), provided mass differences of highly charged ions $^{163}\mathrm{Ho}^{q+}$ and $^{163}\mathrm{Dy}^{q+}$ is known from experiment. The $Q$ value is required by experiments on the determination of the absolute scale of the electron neutrino mass by studying the beta-decay process.

2023-06-05, **Beyond Tree Level with Solar Neutrinos: Towards Measuring the Flavor Composition and CP Violation**, Vedran Brdar et.al., [2306.03160v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03160v1)

 After being produced as electron neutrinos ($\nu\_e$), solar neutrinos partially change their flavor to $\nu\_{\mu}$ and $\nu\_{\tau}$ en route to Earth. Although the flavor ratio of the $\nu\_e$ flux to the total flux has been well measured, the $\nu\_{\mu}:\nu\_{\tau}$ composition has not yet been experimentally probed. In this work we show that the $\nu\_{\mu}:\nu\_{\tau}$ flavor ratio could be measured by utilizing flavor-dependent radiative corrections in the cross sections for $\nu\_{\mu}$ and $\nu\_{\tau}$ scattering. Moreover, since the transition probabilities of $\nu\_e$ to $\nu\_\mu$ and $\nu\_\tau$ depend on the leptonic CP phase, we also demonstrate that the method proposed in this work will allow next-generation neutrino experiments to probe leptonic CP violation through the observation of solar neutrinos.

2023-06-05, **Effective field theory for radiative corrections to charged-current processes I: Vector coupling**, Vincenzo Cirigliano et.al., [2306.03138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03138v1)

 We study radiative corrections to low-energy charged-current processes involving nucleons, such as neutron beta decay and (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering within a top-down effective-field-theory approach. We first match the Standard Model to the low-energy effective theory valid below the weak scale and, using renormalization group equations with anomalous dimensions of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha, \alpha \alpha\_s, \alpha^2)$, evolve the resulting effective coupling down to the hadronic scale. Here, we first match to heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory and subsequently, below the pion-mass scale, to a pionless effective theory, evolving the effective vector coupling with anomalous dimensions of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha, \alpha^2)$ all the way down to the scale of the electron mass, relevant for beta decays. We thus provide a new evaluation of the ``inner" radiative corrections to the vector coupling constant and to the neutron decay rate, discussing differences with the previous literature. Using our new result for the radiative corrections, we update the extraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V\_{ud}$ from the neutron decay.

2023-06-05, **Improved Modeling of the Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Projected-Fields signal and its Cosmological Dependence**, Raagini Patki et.al., [2306.03127v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03127v1)

 Over the past decade, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect has emerged as an observational probe of the distribution of baryons and velocity fields in the late Universe. Of the many ways to detect the kSZ, the `projected-fields kSZ estimator' has the promising feature of not being limited galaxy samples with accurate redshifts. The current theoretical modeling of this estimator involves an approximate treatment only applicable at small scales. As the measurement fidelity rapidly improves, we find it necessary to move beyond the original treatment and hence derive an improved theoretical model for this estimator without these previous approximations. We show that the differences between the predicted signal from the two models are scale-dependent and will be significant for future measurements from the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 in combination with galaxy data from WISE or the Rubin Observatory, which have high forecasted signal-to-noise ratios ($>100$). Thus, adopting our improved model in future analyses will be important to avoid biases. Equipped with our model, we explore the cosmological dependence of this kSZ signal for future measurements. With a Planck prior, residual uncertainty on $\Lambda$CDM parameters leads to $\sim7\%$ marginalized uncertainties on the signal amplitude, compared to a sub-percent level forecasted with a fixed cosmology. To illustrate the potential of this kSZ estimator as a cosmological probe, we forecast initial constraints on $\Lambda$CDM parameters and the sum of neutrino masses, paving the way for jointly fitting both baryonic astrophysics and cosmology in future analyses.

2023-06-05, **P, CP solution of the strong CP puzzle**, Ravi Kuchimanchi et.al., [2306.03039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03039v1)

 We use parity (P) to set $\theta\_{QCD}$ to zero in the minimal left-right symmetric model, add a heavy vectorlike quark family, and obtain in a novel manner the Nelson Barr (NB) form associated so far only with spontaneous CP solution to the strong CP Puzzle. Our solution does not have the `coincidence of scales problem', that typically plagues NB models. P protects $\bar{\theta}$, if it breaks at a scale $v\_R$ below the mass $M$ of the heavy quarks, and $\bar{\theta} \sim 10^{-9} (v\_R/M)^2$ is radiatively generated, which can be acceptably small. On the other hand, if $M < v\_R$, the $\bar{\theta} \sim 10^{-9}$ generated by the NB mechanism is too large, but $\delta\_{CKM}$ can be obtained without the NB mechanism, and surprisingly a lower irreducible $\bar{\theta} \sim (10^{-13}~to~10^{-10}) ln( {v\_R/M)}$, testable by neutron EDM experiments is generated. No leptonic CP violation is generated (Dirac phase $\delta\_{CP} = 0~or~\pi$ in PMNS matrix) which makes the minimal model testable by neutrino experiments. We also discuss some challenges in a non-minimal model that generates leptonic CP violation. Lastly but importantly, we find with $SU(2)\_L \times SU(2)\_R$ gauge group, that there is an \textit{automatic} NB solution on imposing CP (global symmetry usually imposed to get the NB form is accidental once we have $SU(2)\_R$), which does not require mirror or generalized parity and is more economical, as it works also with just 1 mirror generation.

2023-06-05, **$f(Q)$-gravity and neutrino physics**, Luís Atayde et.al., [2306.03015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03015v1)

 Within the $f(Q)$-gravity framework we perform a phenomenological study of the cosmological observables in light of the degeneracy between neutrinos physics and the modified gravity parameter and we identify specific patterns which allow to break such degeneracy. We also provide separately constraints on the total mass of the neutrinos, $\Sigma m\_{\nu}$, and on the effective number of neutrino species, $N\_{\rm eff}$, using cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), redshift space distortion (RSD), supernovae (SNIa), galaxy clustering (GC) and weak gravitational lensing (WL) measurements. The strongest upper bound on the total mass of the neutrinos is found for the combination of CMB+BAO+RSD+SNIa and it is $\Sigma m\_\nu<0.277$ eV at 95\% C.L. For the same combination of data we find $N\_{\rm eff}=2.93^{+0.31}\_{-0.34}$ at 95\% C.L. We also find that all combinations of data we consider, prefer a stronger gravitational interaction than $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we consider the $\chi^2$ and deviance information criterion statistics and find the $f(Q)+\Sigma m\_\nu$ model to be statistically supported by data over the standard scenario. On the contrary $f(Q)+N\_{\rm eff}$ is supported by CMB+BAO+RSD+SNIa but a moderate evidence against it is found with GC and WL data.

2023-06-05, **Measurements of $π^+$, $π^-$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, $K^+$ and $K^-$ production in 120 GeV/$c$ p + C interactions**, H. Adhikary et.al., [2306.02961v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02961v1)

 This paper presents multiplicity measurements of charged hadrons produced in 120 GeV/$c$ proton-carbon interactions. The measurements were made using data collected at the NA61/SHINE experiment during two different data-taking periods, with increased phase space coverage in the second configuration due to the addition of new subdetectors. Particle identification via $dE/dx$ was employed to obtain double-differential production multiplicities of $\pi^+$, $\pi^-$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, $K^+$ and $K^-$. These measurements are presented as a function of laboratory momentum in intervals of laboratory polar angle covering the range from 0 to 450 mrad. They provide crucial inputs for current and future long-baseline neutrino experiments, where they are used to estimate the initial neutrino flux.

2023-06-05, **Searching for DM induced neutrino signals in dSphs using 10 years of IceCube public data**, Xue-Kang Guo et.al., [2306.02675v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02675v1)

 This study searches for neutrino signals from 18 dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) using 10 years of publicly available muon-track data of the IceCube neutrino observatory. We apply an unbinned likelihood analysis on each of these dSphs to derive the significance the putative neutrino emission. To further enhance our sensitivity, we also stack all dSphs together to perform a joint analysis. However, no significant neutrino emission signal was detected in either the single-source or stacking analysis. Based on these null results, we derive constraints on the annihilation cross section of dark matter particles. Compared to the existing literature, our constraints via the channel $\chi\chi\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ are comparable to the ones from the VERITAS observations of dSphs.

2023-06-06, **Observational Evidence for Primordial Black Holes: A Positivist Perspective**, Bernard Carr et.al., [2306.03903v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03903v1)

 We review numerous arguments for primordial black holes (PBHs) based on observational evidence from a variety of lensing, dynamical, accretion and gravitational-wave effects. This represents a shift from the usual emphasis on PBH constraints and provides what we term a positivist perspective. Microlensing observations of stars and quasars suggest that PBHs of around $1\,M\_{\odot}$ could provide much of the dark matter in galactic halos, this being allowed by the Large Magellanic Cloud observations if the PBHs have an extended mass function. More generally, providing the mass and dark matter fraction of the PBHs is large enough, the associated Poisson fluctuations could generate the first bound objects at a much earlier epoch than in the standard cosmological scenario. This simultaneously explains the recent detection of high-redshift dwarf galaxies, puzzling correlations of the source-subtracted infrared and X-ray cosmic backgrounds, the size and the mass-to-light ratios of ultra-faint-dwarf galaxies, the dynamical heating of the Galactic disk, and the binary coalescences observed by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA in a mass range not usually associated with stellar remnants. Even if PBHs provide only a small fraction of the dark matter, they could explain various other observational conundra, and sufficiently large ones could seed the supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei or even early galaxies themselves. We argue that PBHs would naturally have formed around the electroweak, quantum chromodynamics and electron-positron annihilation epochs, when the sound-speed inevitably dips. This leads to an extended PBH mass function with a number of distinct bumps, the most prominent one being at around $1\,M\_{\odot}$, and this would allow PBHs to explain much of the evidence in a unified way.

2023-06-06, **Phase-space analysis of torsion-coupled dilatonic ghost condensate**, Manuel Gonzalez-Espinoza et.al., [2306.03386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03386v1)

 We studied the cosmological dynamics of a dilatonic ghost condensate field as a source of dark energy, which is non-minimally coupled to gravity through torsion. We performed a detailed phase-space analysis by finding all the critical points and their stability conditions. Also, we compared our results with the latest $H(z)$ and Supernovae Ia observational data. In particular, we found the conditions for the existence of scaling regimes during the dark matter era. Furthermore, we obtained the conditions for a successful exit from the scaling regime, such that, at late times, the universe tends towards an attractor point describing the dark energy-dominated era. These intriguing features can allow us to alleviate the energy scale problem of dark energy since, during a scaling regime, the field energy density is not necessarily negligible at early times.

2023-06-05, **Predictions of the 21cm global signal in the JWST and ALMA era**, Atrideb Chatterjee et.al., [2306.03149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03149v1)

 We calculate the redshift evolution of the global 21cm signal in the first billion years using a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, DELPHI, that jointly tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their constituent baryons including the impact of supernova feedback and dust enrichment. Employing only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters, our model predicts galaxy populations in accord with data from both the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) at $z \sim 5-12$. In addition to this ``fiducial" model, which fully incorporates the impact of dust attenuation, we also explore an unphysical ``maximal" model wherein galaxies can convert a 100\% of their gas into stars instantaneously (and supernova feedback is ignored) required to explain JWST data at $z >=13$. We also explore a wide range of values for our {\it 21cm} parameters that include the impact of X-ray heating ($f\_{\rm X,h} =0.02-2.0$) and the escape fraction of Lyman Alpha photons ($f\_\alpha = 0.01-1.0$). Our key findings are: (i) the fiducial model predicts a global 21cm signal which reaches a minimum brightness temperature of $ T\_{\rm b, min}\sim -215$ mK at a redshift $z\_{\rm min} \sim 14$; (ii) since the impact of dust on galaxy properties (such as the star formation rate density) only becomes relevant at $z <= 8$, dust does not have a sensible impact on the global 21cm signal; (iii) the ``maximal" model predicts $T\_{\rm b, min}= -210$ mK as early as $z\_{\rm min} \sim 18$; (iv) galaxy formation and 21cm parameters have a degenerate impact on the global 21cm signal. A combination of the minimum temperature and its redshift will therefore be crucial in constraining galaxy formation parameters and their coupling to the 21cm signal at these early epochs.

2023-06-05, **QCD Axion-Mediated Dark Matter**, Jeff Dror et.al., [2306.03145v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03145v1)

 A QCD axion with a decay constant below $ 10 ^{ 11} ~{\rm GeV} $ is a strongly-motivated extension to the Standard Model, though its relic abundance from the misalignment mechanism or decay of cosmic defects is insufficient to explain the origin of dark matter. Nevertheless, such an axion may still play an important role in setting the dark matter density if it mediates a force between the SM and the dark sector. In this work, we explore QCD axion-mediated freeze-out and freeze-in scenarios, finding that the axion can play a critical role for setting the dark matter density. Assuming the axion solves the strong CP problem makes this framework highly predictive, and we comment on experimental targets.

2023-06-05, **On approximations of the redshift-space bispectrum and power spectrum multipoles covariance matrix**, Sergi Novell-Masot et.al., [2306.03137v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03137v1)

 We investigate, in dark matter and galaxy mocks, the effects of approximating the galaxy power spectrum-bispectrum estimated covariance as a diagonal matrix, for an analysis that aligns with the specs of recent and upcoming galaxy surveys. We find that, for a joint power spectrum and bispectrum data-vector, with corresponding $k$-ranges of $0.02<k<0.15$ and $0.02<k<0.12$ each, the diagonal covariance approximation recovers $\sim 10\%$ larger error-bars on the parameters $\{\sigma\_8,f,\alpha\_\parallel,\alpha\_\bot\}$, while still underestimating the true errors by a factor of $\sim 10\%$. This is caused by the diagonal approximation weighting the elements of the data-vector in a sub-optimal way, resulting in a less efficient estimator than the maximum likelihood estimator featuring the full covariance matrix. We further investigate intermediate approximations to the full covariance matrix, with up to $\sim 80\%$ of zero elements, which could be advantageous for theoretical and hybrid approaches. We expect these results to be qualitatively insensitive to variations of the total cosmological volume, predominantly depending on the bin size and shot-noise, thus making them particularly significant for present and future galaxy surveys.

2023-06-05, **Dark Matter Through the Axion-Gluon Portal**, Patrick J. Fitzpatrick et.al., [2306.03128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03128v1)

 Axion-like-particles are a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model that can mediate interactions between the dark matter and ordinary matter. Here we consider an axion portal between the two sectors, where the axion couples to dark matter and to QCD gluons. We establish the relevant processes of interest across the scales of dark matter and axion masses and couplings, identify the distinct mechanisms that control the dark matter relic abundance in each case, and extract the resulting experimental signatures of the gluonic axion portal to dark matter.

2023-06-05, **The cosmic web around the Coma cluster from constrained cosmological simulations: I. Filaments connected to Coma at $z = 0$**, Nicola Malavasi et.al., [2306.03124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03124v1)

 Galaxy clusters in the Universe occupy the important position of nodes of the cosmic web. They are connected among them by filaments, elongated structures composed of dark matter, galaxies, and gas. The connection of galaxy clusters to filaments is important, as it is related to the process of matter accretion onto the former. For this reason, investigating the connections to the cosmic web of massive clusters, especially well known ones for which a lot of information is available, is a hot topic in astrophysics. In a previous work we performed an analysis of the filament connections of the Coma cluster of galaxies, as detected from the observed galaxy distribution. In this work we resort to a numerical simulation whose initial conditions are constrained to reproduce the Local Universe, including the region of the Coma cluster to interpret our observations in an evolutionary context. We detect the filaments connected to the simulated Coma cluster and perform an accurate comparison with the cosmic web configuration we detected in observations. We perform an analysis of the halos' spatial and velocity distributions close to the filaments in the cluster outskirts. We conclude that, although not significantly larger than the average, the flux of accreting matter on the simulated Coma cluster is significantly more collimated close to the filaments with respect to the general isotropic accretion flux. This paper is the first example of such a result and the first installment in a series of publications which will explore the build-up of the Coma cluster system in connection to the filaments of the cosmic web as a function of redshift.

2023-06-05, **Constraints on long-lived di-baryons and di-baryonic dark matter**, Glennys R. Farrar et.al., [2306.03123v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03123v1)

 A long-lived color-flavor-spin singlet state of six quarks $uuddss$ ($S$, or sexaquark) has been argued to be a potential dark matter candidate. If $S$ is lighter than two bound nucleons, the conversion of two nucleons in a nucleus to an $S$ engenders instability of nuclei. If $S$ is heavier, it can decay to two baryons. Both these transition rates are governed by the effective Yukawa coupling for the dissociation of $S$ into two baryons with the same quantum numbers as $S$, denoted $\tilde{g}$. In this paper, we place strong observational constraints on $\tilde{g}$, improving on various previous limits. The stability of deuterium severely disfavors $m\_S<1800$ MeV, while if $m\_S>2050$ MeV its lifetime is too short to be the dark matter. Laboratory experimental searches for the H-dibaryon, which has the same quark content as the $S$, can probe $\tilde{g}$ down to $2\times 10^{-5}$; cooling of SN1987a may provide a factor-few stronger limit. Survival of $S$ dark matter in the hot hadronic phase of the early universe requires $\tilde{g}\lesssim 2\times 10^{-6}$. In the intermediate mass interval, 1850 MeV $< m\_S< 2050$ MeV, all of the above constraints are compatible with theoretical estimates of $\tilde{g}$, as we discuss.

2023-06-05, **Signatures of primordial black holes in gravitational wave clustering**, Sarah Libanore et.al., [2306.03087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03087v1)

 The possible existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) is an open question in modern cosmology. Among the probes to test it, gravitational waves (GW) coming from their mergers constitute a powerful tool. In this work, we study how stellar mass PBH binaries could affect measurements of the clustering of merger events in future GW surveys. We account for PBH binaries formed both in the early and late Universe and show that the power spectrum modification they introduce can be detected at $\sim 2\sigma-3\sigma$ (depending on some assumptions) whenever PBH mergers make up at least $\sim 60\%$ of the overall number of detected events. By adding cross-correlations with galaxy surveys, this threshold is lowered to $\sim 40\%$. In the case of a poor redshift determination of GW sources, constraints are degraded by about a factor of 2. Assuming a theoretical model for the PBH merger rate, we can convert our results to constraints on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, $f\_{\rm PBH}$. Finally, we perform a Bayesian model selection forecast and confirm that the analysis we develop could be able to detect $\sim30M\_\odot$ PBHs if they account for $f\_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$, depending on the model uncertainty considered, being thus competitive with other probes.

2023-06-05, **Constraining extended cosmologies with GW$\times$LSS cross-correlations**, Michele Bosi et.al., [2306.03031v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03031v1)

 The rapid development of gravitational wave astronomy provides the unique opportunity of exploring the dynamics of the Universe using clustering properties of coalescing binary black hole mergers. Gravitational wave data, along with information coming from future galaxy surveys, have the potential of shedding light about many open questions in Cosmology, including those regarding the nature of dark matter and dark energy. In this work we explore which combination of gravitational wave and galaxy survey datasets are able to provide the best constraints both on modified gravity theories and on the nature of the very same binary black hole events. In particular, by using the public Boltzmann code \texttt{Multi\\_CLASS}, we compare cosmological constraints on popular $\Lambda$CDM extensions coming from gravitational waves alone and in conjunction with either deep and localized or wide and shallow galaxy surveys. We show that constraints on extensions of General Relativity will be at the same level of existing limits from gravitational waves alone or one order of magnitude better when galaxy surveys are included. Furthermore, cross-correlating both kind of galaxy survey with gravitational waves datasets will allow to confidently rule in or out primordial black holes as dark matter candidate in the majority of the allowed parameter space.

 We present numerical solutions to Einstein's equations describing large spherical cosmic voids constituted by two components; dark matter and baryons, with a non-vanishing initial relative velocity, in an asymptotically homogeneous background compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM concordance model. We compute numerically the evolution of such configurations in the dark matter frame, with a hypothetical homogeneous distribution of baryons, but respecting the values dictated by the concordance model for the average baryon-to-dark matter density ratio. We reproduce the well known formation of overdensities at the edge of the void, and recover the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi solutions in the comoving limit of our simulations. We compute the average growth factor of matter fluctuations, and find that it departs significantly from the linear perturbative prescription even in the comoving case, where the non-linearity of inhomogeneities has an impact.

 Recent indirect searches of dark matter using gamma-ray, radio, and cosmic-ray data have provided some stringent constraints on annihilating dark matter. In this article, we propose a new indirect method to constrain annihilating dark matter. By using the data of the G2 cloud near the Galactic supermassive black hole Sgr A*, we can get stringent constraints on the parameter space of dark matter mass and the annihilation cross section, especially for the non-leptophilic annihilation channels $b\bar{b}$ and $W^{\pm}$. For the thermal annihilation cross section, the lower bounds of dark matter mass can be constrained up to TeV order for the non-leptophilic channels with the standard spike index $\gamma\_{\rm sp}=7/3$.

 We studied the cosmological dynamics of a dilatonic ghost condensate field as a source of dark energy, which is non-minimally coupled to gravity through torsion. We performed a detailed phase-space analysis by finding all the critical points and their stability conditions. Also, we compared our results with the latest $H(z)$ and Supernovae Ia observational data. In particular, we found the conditions for the existence of scaling regimes during the dark matter era. Furthermore, we obtained the conditions for a successful exit from the scaling regime, such that, at late times, the universe tends towards an attractor point describing the dark energy-dominated era. These intriguing features can allow us to alleviate the energy scale problem of dark energy since, during a scaling regime, the field energy density is not necessarily negligible at early times.

2023-06-06, **Properties of Gamma-Ray Bursts Associated with Supernovae and Kilonovae**, Q. M. Li et.al., [2306.03365v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03365v1)

 We systematically compare the temporal and spectral properties of 53 Supernova (SN)-associated and 15 Kilonova (KN)-associated Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). We find that the spectral parameters of both types GRBs are identically and lognormally distributed, consistent with those normal GRBs. The bolometric luminosities of SN/GRBs and KN/GRBs have a triple form with the corresponding break luminosities of SN/GRBs are roughly two orders of magnitude larger than those of KN/GRBs. We build the power-law relations between the spectral lag and the luminosity of prompt $\gamma$-rays with indices of $-1.43\pm0.33$ for SN/GRBs and $-2.17\pm0.57$ for KN/GRBs in the laboratory frame, which are respectively coincident with the rest-frame values. We verify that both SN/GRBs and KN/GRBs comply with their own Amati relations that match those of long and short GRBs, respectively. Analyzing X-ray afterglows with good plateau segments, we build the power-law relations between the X-ray luminosity and the plateau time with an index of $-1.12\pm0.17$ for KN/GRBs and $-1.08\pm0.22$ for SN/GRBs, which can be well explained by the relativistic shock driven by an energy injection. The plots of luminosity-lag, Amati relation and luminosity-time show heavy overlap between the two types of GRBs, implying that they might share the same radiation mechanism despite originating from different progenitors or central engines.

2023-06-06, **Many Roads Lead to Lithium: Formation Pathways For Lithium-Rich Red Giants**, Maryum Sayeed et.al., [2306.03323v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03323v1)

 Stellar models predict that lithium (Li) inside a star is destroyed during the first dredge-up phase, yet 1.2% of red giant stars are Li-rich. We aim to uncover possible origins of this population, by analysing 1155 Li-rich giants (A(Li) $\geq$ 1.5) in GALAH DR3. To expose peculiar traits of Li-rich stars, we construct a reference sample of Li-normal (doppelg\"anger) stars with matched evolutionary state and fiducial supernova abundances. Comparing Li-rich and doppelg\"anger spectra reveals systematic differences in the H-$\alpha$ and Ca-triplet line profiles associated with the velocity broadening measurement. We also find twice as many Li-rich stars appear to be fast rotators (2% with $v\_\textrm{broad} \gtrsim 20$ km s$^{-1}$) compared to doppelg\"angers. On average, Li-rich stars have higher abundances than their doppelg\"angers, for a subset of elements, and Li-rich stars at the base of RGB have higher mean $s-$process abundances ($\geq 0.05$ dex for Ba, Y, Zr), relative to their doppelg\"angers. External mass-transfer from intermediate-mass AGB companions could explain this signature. Additional companion analysis excludes binaries with mass ratios $\gtrsim$ 0.5 at $\gtrsim$ 7 AU. We also discover that highly Ba-enriched stars are missing from the Li-rich population, possibly due to low-mass AGB companions which preclude Li-enrichment. Finally, we confirm a prevalence of Li-rich stars on the red clump that increases with lithium, which supports an evolutionary state mechanism for Li-enhancement. Multiple culprits, including binary spin-up and mass-transfer, are therefore likely mechanisms of Li-enrichment.

2023-06-05, **Predictions of the 21cm global signal in the JWST and ALMA era**, Atrideb Chatterjee et.al., [2306.03149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03149v1)

 We calculate the redshift evolution of the global 21cm signal in the first billion years using a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, DELPHI, that jointly tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their constituent baryons including the impact of supernova feedback and dust enrichment. Employing only two redshift- and mass-independent free parameters, our model predicts galaxy populations in accord with data from both the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) at $z \sim 5-12$. In addition to this ``fiducial" model, which fully incorporates the impact of dust attenuation, we also explore an unphysical ``maximal" model wherein galaxies can convert a 100\% of their gas into stars instantaneously (and supernova feedback is ignored) required to explain JWST data at $z >=13$. We also explore a wide range of values for our {\it 21cm} parameters that include the impact of X-ray heating ($f\_{\rm X,h} =0.02-2.0$) and the escape fraction of Lyman Alpha photons ($f\_\alpha = 0.01-1.0$). Our key findings are: (i) the fiducial model predicts a global 21cm signal which reaches a minimum brightness temperature of $ T\_{\rm b, min}\sim -215$ mK at a redshift $z\_{\rm min} \sim 14$; (ii) since the impact of dust on galaxy properties (such as the star formation rate density) only becomes relevant at $z <= 8$, dust does not have a sensible impact on the global 21cm signal; (iii) the ``maximal" model predicts $T\_{\rm b, min}= -210$ mK as early as $z\_{\rm min} \sim 18$; (iv) galaxy formation and 21cm parameters have a degenerate impact on the global 21cm signal. A combination of the minimum temperature and its redshift will therefore be crucial in constraining galaxy formation parameters and their coupling to the 21cm signal at these early epochs.

2023-06-05, **Real-Time Technosignature Strategies with SN 2023ixf**, James R. A. Davenport et.al., [2306.03118v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03118v1)

 Several technosignature techniques focus on historic events such as SN 1987A as the basis to search for coordinated signal broadcasts from extraterrestrial agents. The recently discovered SN 2023ixf in the spiral galaxy M101 is the nearest Type II supernova in over a decade, and will serve as an important benchmark event. Here we review the potential for SN 2023ixf to advance ongoing techonsignature searches, particularly signal-synchronization techniques such as the "SETI Ellipsoid". We find that more than 100 stars within 100 pc are already close to intersecting this SETI Ellipsoid, providing numerous targets for real-time monitoring within ~3$^\circ$ of SN 2023ixf. We are commencing a radio technosignature monitoring campaign of these targets with the Allen Telescope Array and the Green Bank Telescope.

2023-06-05, **Deuterium Fractionation across the Infrared Dark Cloud G034.77-00.55 interacting with the Supernova Remnant W44**, G. Cosentino et.al., [2306.02877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02877v1)

 Supernova remnants (SNRs) may regulate star formation in galaxies. For example, SNR-driven shocks may form new molecular gas or compress pre-existing clouds and trigger the formation of new stars. To test this scenario, we measure the deuteration of $N\_2H^+$, $D\_{frac}^{N\_2H^+}$, a well-studied tracer of pre-stellar cores, across the Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G034.77-00.55, known to be experiencing a shock interaction with the SNR W44. We use N$\_2$H$^+$ and N$\_2$D$^+$ J=1-0 single pointing observations obtained with the 30m antenna at the Instituto de Radioastronomia Millimetrica to infer $D\_{frac}^{N\_2H^+}$ toward five positions across the cloud, namely a massive core, different regions across the shock front, a dense clump and ambient gas. We find $D\_{frac}^{N\_2H^+}$ in the range 0.03-0.1, several orders of magnitude larger than the cosmic D/H ratio ($\sim$10$^{-5}$). Across the shock front, $D\_{frac}^{N\_2H^+}$ is enhanced by more than a factor of 2 ($D\_{frac}^{N\_2H^+}\sim$0.05-0.07) with respect to the ambient gas ($\leq$0.03) and similar to that measured generally in pre-stellar cores. Indeed, in the massive core and dense clump regions of this IRDC we measure $D\_{frac}^{N\_2H^+}$}$\sim$0.1. We find enhanced deuteration of $N\_2H^+$ across the region of the shock, at a level that is enhanced with respect to regions of unperturbed gas. It is possible that this has been induced by shock compression, which would then be indirect evidence that the shock is triggering conditions for future star formation. However, since unperturbed dense regions also show elevated levels of deuteration, further, higher-resolution studies are needed to better understand the structure and kinematics of the deuterated material in the shock region, e.g., if it still in relatively diffuse form or already organised in a population of low-mass pre-stellar cores.
