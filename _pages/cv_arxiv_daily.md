2023-06-21, **Best-case scenarios for neutrino capture experiments**, Kyrylo Bondarenko et.al., [2306.12366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12366v1)

 A direct discovery of the cosmic neutrino background would bring to a closure the searches for relic left-over radiation predicted by the Hot Big Bang cosmology. Recently, the KATRIN experiment put a limit on the local relic neutrino overdensity with respect to the cosmological predicted average value at $\eta \lesssim 10^{11}$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 011806 (2022)]. In this work, we first examine to what extent such values of $\eta$ are conceivable. We show that even under cavalier assumptions, a cosmic origin of $\eta \gtrsim 10^4$ seems out of reach (with the caveat of forming bound objects under a new force,) but find that a hypothetical local source of low-energy neutrinos could achieve $\eta \sim 10^{11}$. Second, when such values are considered, we point out that the experimental signature in KATRIN and other neutrino-capture experiments changes, contrary to what has hitherto been assumed. Our results are model-independent and maximally accommodating as they only assume the Pauli exclusion principle. As intermittent physics target in the quest for C$\nu$B detection, we identify an experimental sensitivity to $\eta \sim 10^4$ for which conceivable sources exist; to resolve the effect of a degenerate Fermi gas for such overdensity an energy resolution of 10 meV is required.

2023-06-21, **Light dark matter search with DarkSide-50**, D. Franco et.al., [2306.12151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12151v1)

 We present the latest results from the search for light dark matter particle interactions with the DarkSide-50 dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber. This analysis, based on the ionization signal only, improves the existing limits for spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interactions in the $[1.2, 3.6]$ GeV/c$^2$ mass range. The sensitivity is extended down to 40 MeV/c$^2$ by assuming the Migdal effect, responsible for an additional ionization signal from the recoiling atom. Finally, we set new constraints to interactions of dark matter particles with electrons in the final state, namely WIMPs, galactic axions, dark photons, and sterile neutrinos.

2023-06-21, **Left-Right Symmetry at FCC-hh**, Miha Nemevšek et.al., [2306.12104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12104v1)

 We study the production of right-handed $W\_R$ bosons and heavy neutrinos $N$ at a future 100 TeV high energy hadron collider in the context of Left-Right symmetry, including the effects of $W\_L-W\_R$ gauge-boson mixing. We estimate the collider reach for up to 3/ab integrated luminosity using a multi-binned sensitivity measure. In the Keung-Senjanovi\'c and missing energy channels, the 3$\sigma$ sensitivity extends up to $M\_{W\_R}=35$ and 37 TeV, respectively. We further clarify the interplay between the missing energy channel and the (expected) limits from neutrinoless double beta decay searches, Big Bang nucleosynthesis and dark matter.

2023-06-21, **Paarl Africa Underground Laboratory (PAUL)**, Robert Adam et.al., [2306.12083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12083v1)

 Establishing a deep underground physics laboratory to study, amongst others, double beta decay, geoneutrinos, reactor neutrinos and dark matter has been discussed for more than a decade within the austral African physicists' community. PAUL, the Paarl Africa Underground Laboratory, is an initiative foreseeing an open international laboratory devoted to the development of competitive science in the austral region. It has the advantage that the location, the Huguenot tunnel, exists already and the geology and the environment of the site is appropriate for an experimental facility. The paper describes the PAUL initiative, presents the physics prospects and discusses the capacity for building the future experimental facility.

2023-06-21, **Superscaling in the resonance region for neutrino-nucleus scattering: The SuSAv2-DCC model**, J. Gonzalez-Rosa et.al., [2306.12060v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12060v1)

 In this work the SuSAv2 and dynamical coupled-channels (DCC) models have been combined and tested in the inelastic regime for electron and neutrino reactions on nuclei. The DCC model, an approach to study baryon resonances through electron and neutrino induced meson production reactions, has been implemented for the first time in the SuSAv2-inelastic model to analyze the resonance region. Within this framework, we also present a novel description about other inelasticities in the resonance region (SoftDIS). The outcomes of these approaches are firstly benchmarked against (e,e') data on 12C. The description is thus extended to the study of neutrino-nucleus inclusive cross sections on 12C and 40Ar and compared with data from the T2K, MicroBooNE, ArgoNEUT and MINERvA experiments, thus covering a wide kinematical range.

2023-06-20, **Search for the anomalous quartic gauge couplings through $Zγ$ production at $e^{-} e^{+}$ colliders**, M. Köksal et.al., [2306.11894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11894v1)

 Spontaneous breaking of the $SU(2)\_{L}\times U(1)\_{Y}$ electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) sets the constraints on triple gauge couplings and quartic gauge couplings. Therefore, the measurement of multiboson production in $e^{-} e^{+}$ collisions allows us to directly examine the SM predictions and perform indirect investigations of new physics beyond the SM. In this paper, we concentrate the process $e^{-} e^{+} \to e^{-} Z\gamma e^{+}$ with $Z$ boson decaying to neutrinos to investigate the anomalous quartic gauge couplings using the effective Lagrangian approach at the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). We obtain the sensitivities on the anomalous $ f\_ {Ti}/\Lambda^4$ ($i=0,2,5,6,7,8,9$) couplings taking into account the systematic uncertainties of $3, 5 \%$ at $95\%$ Confidence Level for the CLIC with $\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV. Our results show that the sensitivities on some anomalous couplings without systematic errors are up to two orders of magnitude better than the current experimental limits. Considering a realistic systematic uncertainty such as $5 \%$ from possible experimental sources, the sensitivity of all anomalous quartic couplings gets worse by about $10\%$ compared to those without systematic uncertainty for the CLIC.

2023-06-20, **Search for events in XENON1T associated with Gravitational Waves**, XENON Collaboration et.al., [2306.11871v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11871v1)

 We perform a blind search for particle signals in the XENON1T dark matter detector that occur close in time to gravitational wave signals in the LIGO and Virgo observatories. No particle signal is observed in the nuclear recoil, electronic recoil, CE$\nu$NS, and S2-only channels within $\pm$ 500 seconds of observations of the gravitational wave signals GW170104, GW170729, GW170817, GW170818, and GW170823. We use this null result to constrain mono-energetic neutrinos and Beyond Standard Model particles emitted in the closest coalescence GW170817, a binary neutron star merger. We set new upper limits on the fluence (time-integrated flux) of coincident neutrinos down to 17 keV at 90% confidence level. Furthermore, we constrain the product of coincident fluence and cross section of Beyond Standard Model particles to be less than $10^{-29}$ cm$^2$/cm$^2$ in the [5.5-210] keV energy range at 90% confidence level.

2023-06-20, **Microquasar Cyg X-3 -- a unique jet-wind neutrino factory?**, Karri I. I. Koljonen et.al., [2306.11804v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11804v1)

 The origin of astrophysical neutrinos is one of the most debated topics today. Perhaps the most robust evidence of neutrino counterpart comes from supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei associated with strongly collimated outflows, or jets, that can accelerate particles to relativistic energies and produce neutrinos through hadronic interactions. Similar outflows can also be found from X-ray binaries, or `microquasars', that consist of a neutron star or a stellar-mass black hole accreting matter from a non-degenerate companion star. In some cases, these systems can accelerate particles up to GeV energies implying an efficient acceleration mechanism in their jets. Neutrino production in microquasar jets can be expected with suitable conditions and a hadronic particle population. Microquasar Cyg X-3 is a unique, short orbital period X-ray binary hosting a Wolf-Rayet companion star with a strong stellar wind. The interaction of the dense stellar wind with a relativistic jet leads to particle collisions followed by high-energy gamma-ray and potentially neutrino emission. Here, using the 10-year neutrino candidate sample of the IceCube neutrino observatory, we find that the events with the highest spatial association with Cyg X-3 occur during short-lived high-energy gamma-ray flaring periods indicating the possible astrophysical nature of these events.

2023-06-20, **Implications of the DLMA solution of $θ_{12}$ for IceCube data using different astrophysical sources**, Monojit Ghosh et.al., [2306.11653v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11653v1)

 In this paper, we study the implications of the Dark Large Mixing Angle (DLMA) solutions of $\theta\_{12}$ in the context of the IceCube data. We study the consequences in the measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameters namely $\theta\_{23}$ and $\delta\_{\rm CP}$ in light of both Large Mixing Angle (LMA) and DLMA solutions of $\theta\_{12}$. We find that it will be impossible for IceCube to determine the $\delta\_{\rm CP}$ and the true nature of $\theta\_{12}$ i.e., LMA or DLMA at the same time. This is because of the existence of an intrinsic degeneracy at the Hamiltonian level between these parameters. Apart from that, we also identify a new degeneracy between $\theta\_{23}$ and two solutions of $\theta\_{12}$ for a fixed value of $\delta\_{\rm CP}$. We perform a chi-square fit using three different astrophysical sources, i.e., $\mu$ source, $\pi$ source, and $n$ source to find that both $\mu$ source and $\pi$ source are allowed within $1 \sigma$ whereas the $n$ source is excluded at $2 \sigma$. It is difficult to make any conclusion regarding the measurement of $\theta\_{23}$, $\delta\_{\rm CP}$ for $\mu$ source. However, The $\pi$ ($n$) source prefers higher (lower) octant of $\theta\_{23}$ for both LMA and DLMA solution of $\theta\_{12}$. The best-fit value of $\delta\_{\rm CP}$ is around $180^\circ$ ($0^\circ/360^\circ$) for LMA (DLMA) solution of $\theta\_{12}$ whereas for DLMA (LMA) solution of $\theta\_{12}$, the best-fit value is around $0^\circ/360^\circ$ ($180^\circ$) for $\pi$ ($n$) source. If we assume the current best-fit values of $\theta\_{23}$ and $\delta\_{\rm CP}$ to be true, then the $\mu$ and $\pi$ source prefer the LMA solution of $\theta\_{12}$ whereas the $n$ source prefers the DLMA solution of $\theta\_{12}$.

2023-06-20, **Neutrino Mixing Phenomenology: \boldsymbol{$A_4$} Discrete Flavor Symmetry with Type-I Seesaw Mechanism**, Animesh Barman et.al., [2306.11461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11461v1)

 We study a neutrino mass model with $A\_4$ flavor symmetry using a type-I seesaw mechanism. The inclusion of extra flavons in our model leads to the deviations from exact tribimaximal mixing pattern resulting in a nonzero $\theta\_{13}$ consistent with the recent experimental results and a sum rule for light neutrino masses is also obtained. In this framework, a connection is established among the mixing angles ($\theta\_{13}$, $\theta\_{12}$, $\theta\_{13}$) and the Dirac CP-violation phase $\delta\_{CP}$. This model also allows us a prediction of Jarlskog parameter $J\_{CP}$ and the octant of the mixing angle $\theta\_{23}$. We use the parameter space of our model of neutrino masses to study the neutrinoless double beta decay parameter $m\_{ee}$.

2023-06-21, **Detection and characterization of M-L-T-Y dwarfs belonging to the Milky Way Disks and Stellar Halo with the Roman Space Telescope**, Benne Holwerda et.al., [2306.12363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12363v1)

 How many low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and free-floating planets are in the Milky Way? And how are they distributed in our Galaxy? Recent studies of Milky Way interlopers in high-redshift observations have revealed a 150-300 pc thick disk of these cool stars with 7% of the M-dwarfs in an oblate stellar halo. One can use the High Latitude Survey with the Roman Space Telescope to search for Galactic ultracool dwarfs (spectral classes M, L, T, and Y) to accurately model the 3D structure and the temperature and chemical evolution of the Milky Way disk in these low-mass (sub)stellar objects.   Accurate typing has been shown to work on HST grism and photometric data using machine learning techniques. Such an approach can also be applied to Roman photometry, producing accurate photometric typing to within two subtypes. The High Latitude Survey provides enough statistical power to model the Milky Way structural components (thin and thick disks and halo) for M-, L- and T/Y-dwarfs. This approach has the benefit to allow us to constrain scale-lengths, scale-heights and densities, as well as the relative position of our Sun with respect to the disk of dwarf stars of our Milky Way. The total number of each brown dwarf type can be used to infer both the low-mass end of the Galaxy-wide Initial Mass Function (IMF) for the first time, the formation history of low-mass stellar and substellar objects, and the fraction of low-mass stars in the halo, a statistic that can test cold dark matter structure formation theories.

2023-06-21, **Learning the galaxy-environment connection with graph neural networks**, John F. Wu et.al., [2306.12327v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12327v1)

 Galaxies co-evolve with their host dark matter halos. Models of the galaxy-halo connection, calibrated using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, can be used to populate dark matter halo catalogs with galaxies. We present a new method for inferring baryonic properties from dark matter subhalo properties using message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs). After training on subhalo catalog data from the Illustris TNG300-1 hydrodynamic simulation, our GNN can infer stellar mass from the host and neighboring subhalo positions, kinematics, masses, and maximum circular velocities. We find that GNNs can also robustly estimate stellar mass from subhalo properties in 2d projection. While other methods typically model the galaxy-halo connection in isolation, our GNN incorporates information from galaxy environments, leading to more accurate stellar mass inference.

2023-06-21, **What is the nature of the HESS J1731-347 compact object?**, Violetta Sagun et.al., [2306.12326v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12326v1)

 Once further confirmed in future analyses, the radius and mass measurement of HESS J1731-347 with $M=0.77^{+0.20}\_{-0.17}~M\_{\odot}$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}\_{-0.78}~\rm km$ will be among the lightest and smallest compact object ever detected. This raises many questions about its nature and opens up the window for different theories to explain such a measurement. In this article, we use the information from Doroshenko et al. (2022) on the mass, radius, and surface temperature together with the multi-messenger observations of neutron stars to investigate the possibility that HESS J1731-347 is one of the lightest observed neutron star (NS), a strange star (SS), a hybrid star (HS) with an early deconfinement phase transition, or a dark matter (DM) admixed neutron star. The nucleonic and quark matter are modeled within realistic equation of states (EoSs) with a self-consistent calculation of the pairing gaps in quark matter. By performing the joint analysis of the thermal evolution and mass-radius constraint, we find evidence that within a 1$\sigma$ confidence level, HESS J1731-347 is consistent with the neutron star scenario with the soft EoS as well as with a strange and hybrid star with the early deconfinement phase transition with a strong quark pairing and neutron star admixed with dark matter.

2023-06-21, **RomAndromeda: The Roman Survey of the Andromeda Halo**, Arjun Dey et.al., [2306.12302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12302v1)

 As our nearest large neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy provides a unique laboratory for investigating galaxy formation and the distribution and substructure properties of dark matter in a Milky Way-like galaxy. Here, we propose an initial 2-epoch ($\Delta t\approx 5$yr), 2-band Roman survey of the entire halo of Andromeda, covering 500 square degrees, which will detect nearly every red giant star in the halo (10$\sigma$ detection in F146, F062 of 26.5, 26.1AB mag respectively) and yield proper motions to $\sim$25 microarcsec/year (i.e., $\sim$90 km/s) for all stars brighter than F146 $\approx 23.6$ AB mag (i.e., reaching the red clump stars in the Andromeda halo). This survey will yield (through averaging) high-fidelity proper motions for all satellites and compact substructures in the Andromeda halo and will enable statistical searches for clusters in chemo-dynamical space. Adding a third epoch during the extended mission will improve these proper motions by $\sim t^{-1.5}$, to $\approx 11$ km/s, but this requires obtaining the first epoch in Year 1 of Roman operations. In combination with ongoing and imminent spectroscopic campaigns with ground-based telescopes, this Roman survey has the potential to yield full 3-d space motions of $>$100,000 stars in the Andromeda halo, including (by combining individual measurements) robust space motions of its entire globular cluster and most of its dwarf galaxy satellite populations. It will also identify high-velocity stars in Andromeda, providing unique information on the processes that create this population. These data offer a unique opportunity to study the immigration history, halo formation, and underlying dark matter scaffolding of a galaxy other than our own.

2023-06-21, **Early Structure Formation from Primordial Density Fluctuations with a Blue, Tilted Power Spectrum -- II. High-Redshift Galaxies**, Shingo Hirano et.al., [2306.11993v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11993v1)

 The first series of observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered unexpectedly abundant luminous galaxies at high redshift, posing possibly a serious challenge to popular galaxy formation models. We study early structure formation in a cosmological model with a blue, tilted power spectrum (BTPS) given by $P(k) \propto k^{m\_{\rm s}}$ with $m\_{\rm s} > 1$ at small length scales. We run a set of cosmological $N$-body simulations and derive the abundance of dark matter halos and of galaxies under simplified assumptions on star formation efficiency. The enhanced small-scale power allows rapid formation of nonlinear structure at $z>7$, and galaxies with stellar mass exceeding $10^{10}\,M\_\odot$ can be formed by $z=9$. Because of frequent mergers, the structure of galaxies and galaxy groups appears overall clumpy. The BTPS model reproduces the observed stellar mass density at $z=7-9$, and thus eases the claimed tension between galaxy formation theory and recent JWST observations. Large-scale structure of the present-day Universe is largely unaffected by the modification of the small-scale power spectrum. Finally, we discuss the formation of the first stars and early super-massive black holes in the BTPS model.

2023-06-21, **Formation of first star clusters under the supersonic gas flow -- I. Morphology of the massive metal-free gas cloud**, Shingo Hirano et.al., [2306.11992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11992v1)

 We performed $42$ simulations of the first star formation with initial supersonic gas flows relative to the dark matter at the cosmic recombination era. Increasing the initial streaming velocities led to delayed halo formation and increased halo mass, enhancing the mass of the gravitationally shrinking gas cloud. For more massive gas clouds, the rate of temperature drop during contraction, in other words, the structure asymmetry, becomes more significant. When the maximum and minimum gas temperature ratios before and after contraction exceed about ten, the asymmetric structure of the gas cloud prevails, inducing fragmentation into multiple dense gas clouds. We continued our simulations until $10^5$ years after the first dense core formation to examine the final fate of the massive star-forming gas cloud. Among the $42$ models studied, we find the simultaneous formation of up to four dense gas clouds, with a total mass of about $2254\,M\_\odot$. While the gas mass in the host halo increases with increasing the initial streaming velocity, the mass of the dense cores does not change significantly. The star formation efficiency decreases by more than one order of magnitude from $\epsilon\_{\rm III} \sim 10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$ when the initial streaming velocity, normalised by the root mean square value, increases from 0 to 3.

2023-06-20, **Comment on "Dark matter as a Weyl geometric effect''**, Israel Quiros et.al., [2306.11926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11926v1)

 In this note we comment on a recent attempt by P. Burikham, T. Harko, K. Pimsamarn and S. Shahidi [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 107}, 064008 (2023)] to explain the galactic rotation curves as the result of the motion of time-like test particles in the Weyl geometric theory of gravity developed in [Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf 82}, 23 (2022)]. We show that the static, spherically symmetric solution found by the authors is not a solution of the assumed Weyl geometric theory with vectorial nonmetricity, but of the well-known conformally coupled scalar theory over Weyl integrable spacetime with gradient nonmetricity, instead. Besides, the solution found does not respect the gauge symmetry of the underlying theory.

2023-06-20, **Velocity dispersion of dark matter deficit ultra-diffuse galaxies: A case for modified gravity**, Esha Bhatia et.al., [2306.11790v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11790v1)

 The line of sight velocity dispersion of the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) NGC1052-DF2 and NGC1052-DF4 have been reasonably explained only with the baryonic matter, without requiring any dark matter contribution. The comparable ratio between the baryonic and halo mass also ascertain the above claim for the two dark matter deficit galaxies. This paves the way for analyzing alternative gravity theories such as the $f(R)$ gravity and the Renormalization Group correction to General Relativity (RGGR). The analysis of the line of sight velocity dispersion shows that the choice of $f(R)$ gravity models such as Taylor expanded $f(R)$ about $R=0$ or a simple power law model of choice $R^n$ is consistent with the observational data. Similar statistical analysis is done for the RGGR and is also found to be a viable explanation for the observed velocity dispersion. We perform a global fit of the model parameters together with both the UDGs. The coupling parameters of the theories are considered as the global ones, and local variables such as the scale parameters are considered to be dependent on the individual galaxy.

2023-06-20, **Gravitational Radiation from hyperbolic encounters in the presence of dark matter**, Abhishek Chowdhuri et.al., [2306.11787v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11787v1)

 In this study, we look into binaries undergoing gravitational radiation during a hyperbolic passage. Such hyperbolic events can be a credible source of gravitational waves in future detectors. We systematically calculate fluxes of gravitational radiation from such events in the presence of dark matter, also considering the effects of dynamical friction. We also investigate the binary dynamics through the changes in the orbital parameters by treating the potential due to dark matter spike and the dynamical friction effects as a perturbation term. An insight into the effects of such a medium on the binaries from the corresponding osculating elements opens up avenues to study binary dynamics for such events.

2023-06-20, **Investigating the Dark Matter Halo of NGC 5128 using a Discrete Dynamical Model**, Antoine Dumont et.al., [2306.11786v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11786v1)

 As the nearest accessible massive early-type galaxy, NGC 5128 presents an exceptional opportunity to measure dark matter halo parameters for a representative elliptical galaxy. Here we take advantage of rich new observational datasets of large-radius tracers to perform dynamical modeling of NGC 5128, using a discrete axisymmetric anisotropic Jeans approach with a total tracer population of nearly 1800 planetary nebulae, globular clusters, and dwarf satellite galaxies extending to a projected distance of $\sim250$ kpc from the galaxy center. We find that a standard NFW halo provides an excellent fit to nearly all the data, excepting a subset of the planetary nebulae that appear to be out of virial equilibrium. The best-fit dark matter halo has a virial mass of ${\rm M}\_{vir}=4.4^{+2.4}\_{-1.4}\times10^{12} {\rm M}\_{\odot}$, and NGC 5128 appears to sit below the mean stellar mass--halo mass and globular cluster mass--halo mass relations, which both predict a halo virial mass closer to ${\rm M}\_{vir} \sim 10^{13} {\rm M}\_{\odot}$. The inferred NFW virial concentration is $c\_{vir}=5.6^{+2.4}\_{-1.6}$, nominally lower than $c\_{vir} \sim 9$ predicted from published $c\_{vir}$--${\rm M}\_{vir}$ relations, but within the $\sim 30\%$ scatter found in simulations. The best-fit dark matter halo constitutes only $\sim10\%$ of the total mass at 1 effective radius but $\sim50\%$ at 5 effective radii. The derived halo parameters are relatively insensitive to reasonable variations in the tracer population considered, tracer anisotropies, and system inclination. Our analysis highlights the value of comprehensive dynamical modeling of nearby galaxies, and the importance of using multiple tracers to allow cross-checks for model robustness.

2023-06-20, **Strong gravitational lensing as a probe of dark matter**, S. Vegetti et.al., [2306.11781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11781v1)

 Dark matter structures within strong gravitational lens galaxies and along their line of sight leave a gravitational imprint on the multiple images of lensed sources. Strong gravitational lensing provides, therefore, a key test of different dark matter models in a way that is independent of the baryonic content of matter structures on subgalactic scales. In this chapter, we describe how galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing observations are sensitive to the physical nature of dark matter. We provide a historical perspective of the field, and review its current status. We discuss the challenges and advances in terms of data, treatment of systematic errors and theoretical predictions, that will enable one to deliver a stringent and robust test of different dark matter models in the near future. With the advent of the next generation of sky surveys, the number of known strong gravitational lens systems is expected to increase by several orders of magnitude. Coupled with high-resolution follow-up observations, these data will provide a key opportunity to constrain the properties of dark matter with strong gravitational lensing.

2023-06-20, **Much ado about no offset -- Characterising the anomalous multiple-image configuration and the model-driven displacement between light and mass in the multi-plane strong lens Abell 3827**, Joyce Lin et.al., [2306.11779v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11779v1)

 Abell 3827 is a unique galaxy cluster with a dry merger in its core causing a highly-resolved multiple-image configuration of a blue spiral galaxy at $z\_\mathrm{s}=1.24$. The surface brightness profiles of four merging galaxies around $z\_\mathrm{d}=0.099$ complicate a clear identification of the number of images and finding corresponding small-scale features across them. The entailed controversies about offsets between luminous and dark matter have never been settled and dark-matter characteristics in tension with bounds from complementary probes and simulations seemed necessary to explain this multiple-image configuration. We resolve these issues with a systematic study of possible feature matchings across all images and their impact on the reconstructed mass density distribution. From the local lens properties directly constrained by these feature matchings without imposing any global lens model, we conclude that none of them are consistent with expected local characteristics from standard single-lens-plane lensing, nor can they be motivated by the light distribution in the cluster. Inspecting complementary spectroscopic data, we show that all these results originate from an insufficient constraining power of the data and seem to hint at a thick lens and not at exotic forms of dark matter or modified gravity. If the thick-lens hypothesis can be corroborated with follow-up multi-plane lens modelling, A3827 suffers from a full three-dimensional degeneracy in the distribution of dark matter because combinations of shearings and scalings in a single lens plane can also be represented by an effective shearing and a rotation caused by multiple lens planes.

2023-06-20, **Equivalence of matter-type modified gravity theories to general relativity with nonminimal matter interaction**, Özgür Akarsu et.al., [2306.11717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11717v1)

 We show that gravity models, such as $f(\mathcal{L}\_{\rm m})$, $f(g\_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu})$ and $f(T\_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu})$, that modify the introduction of the material source in the usual Einstein-Hilbert action by adding only matter-related terms to the matter Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}\_{\rm m}$ are equivalent to general relativity with nonminimal interactions. Through the redefinition $\mathcal{L}\_{\rm m}+f \rightarrow \mathcal{L}\_{\rm m}^{\rm tot}$, these models are exactly GR, yet the usual material field $T\_{\mu\nu}$ and its accompanying partner, viz., the modification field $T\_{\mu\nu}^{\rm mod}$ interact nonminimally. That is, $\nabla^{\mu}T\_{\mu\nu}=-Q\_{\nu}=-\nabla^{\mu}T\_{\mu\nu}^{\rm mod}$, where $Q\_{\nu}$ is the interaction kernel that governs the rate of energy transfer. We focus on the particular model, the energy-momentum squared gravity, where the usual material field $T\_{\mu\nu}$ brings in an accompanying energy-momentum squared field , $T\_{\mu\nu}^{\rm emsf}$ along with a sui generis nonminimal interaction between them. Compared to usual phenomenological nonminimal interaction models in the literature, EMSF gives rise to more intricate interaction kernels having covariant formulation even with simple forms of the $f$ function. We elaborate upon EMSF via some different aspects: a DE component induced from the interaction of sources such as cold dark matter and relativistic species with their accompanying EMSFs generating interacting DE-DM models, mimicking noncanonical scalar field, etc., or a Hoyle-type creation field generating steady-state universe models extended to fluids other than dust and a mimicker of modified generalized Chaplygin gas. We also demonstrate the proper calculation of second metric variation of $\mathcal{L}\_{\rm m}$, as well as in models that contain scalars like $g\_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu}\,,R\_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$ and $G\_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu}$.

 Symplectic gauge theories coupled to matter fields lead to symmetry enhancement phenomena that have potential applications in such diverse contexts as composite Higgs, top partial compositeness, strongly interacting dark matter, and dilaton-Higgs models. These theories are also interesting on theoretical grounds, for example in reference to the approach to the large-N limit. A particularly compelling research aim is the determination of the extent of the conformal window in gauge theories with symplectic groups coupled to matter, for different groups and for field content consisting of fermions transforming in different representations. Such determination would have far-reaching implications, but requires overcoming huge technical challenges.   Numerical studies based on lattice field theory can provide the quantitative information necessary to this endeavour. We developed new software to implement symplectic groups in the Monte Carlo algorithms within the Grid framework. In this paper, we focus most of our attention on the Sp(4) lattice gauge theory coupled to four (Wilson-Dirac) fermions transforming in the 2-index antisymmetric representation, as a case study. We discuss an extensive catalogue of technical tests of the algorithms and present preliminary measurements to set the stage for future large-scale numerical investigations. We also include the scan of parameter space of all asymptotically free Sp(4) lattice gauge theories coupled to varying number of fermions transforming in the antisymmetric representation.

 The first bright objects to form in the Universe at redshift $z \sim 10-20$ might have been Dark Stars, made primarily of hydrogen and helium but powered by dark matter. In this study, we investigate the detectability of Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDS) by the Roman Space Telescope. RST will be able to detect SMDSs at redshifts as high as $z\simeq 14$. In cases with gravitational lensing factors of $\mu\sim 100$, RST will be able to find SMDS as small as $\sim10^4 M\_{\odot}$ at $z\sim 12$ with $\sim 10^6$ s of exposure. To differentiate SMDS from early galaxies containing zero metallicity stars at similar redshifts, we compare their spectra, photometry in RST bands, color indexes and image morphology. With RST alone, the differentiation is possible only for limited cases: SMDS formed via "adiabatic contraction" (DM pulled into the star via gravity alone) with $M\gtrsim 10^5M\_{\odot}$ and lensed by $\mu\gtrsim 30$ have distinct photometric signatures from those of the first galaxies. For SMDSs formed via "dark matter capture," their spectra are degenerate to those of many galaxies with little to no nebular emission. Thus with RST alone, the only way to tell them apart from first galaxies would be via image morphology: i.e. point object (SMDSs) vs. extended object (sufficiently magnified galaxies). However, if the same objects are further examined by JWST spectroscopy, a "smoking gun" for detection of SMDS is the HeII $\lambda$1640 absorption line. While RST does not cover the wavelength band required to find this line (for $z\_{\rm emi}\gtrsim 10$), JWST does. Hence the two detectors can be used together in identifying SMDS. The confirmed detection of any SMDSs will provide evidence for a new type of star, powered by dark matter. Moreover, such massive stars can also be natural progenitors of the supermassive black holes powering the extremely bright quasars observed at $z\gtrsim 6$.

 A chemodynamical model of our galaxy is fitted to data from DR17 of the APOGEE survey supplemented with data from the StarHorse catalogue and gaia DR3. Dynamically, the model is defined by action-based distribution functions for dark matter and six stellar components plus a gas disc. The gravitational potential jointly generated by the model's components is used to examine the galaxy's chemical composition within action space. The observational data probably cover all parts of action space that are populated by stars. The overwhelming majority of stars have angular momentum J\_\phi>0 implying that they were born in the Galactic disc. High-alpha stars dominate in a region that is sharply bounded by J\_\phi \la J\_\phi(solar). Chemically the model is defined by giving each stellar component a Gaussian distribution in ([Fe/H],[Mg/Fe]) space about a mean that is a linear function of the actions. The model's 47 dynamical and 70 chemical parameters are chosen to maximise the likelihood of the data given the model in 72 three-dimensional velocity spaces and 30 two-dimensional chemical spaces. The circular speed falls steadily from 237\kms at R=4\kpc to 218\kms at R=20\kpc. Dark matter contributes half the radial force on the Sun and has local density 0.011\msun\pc^{-3}, there being 24.5\msun\pc^{-2} in dark matter and 26.5\msun\pc^{-2} in stars within 1.1\kpc of the plane.

 Earth can act as a transducer to convert ultralight bosonic dark matter (axions and hidden photons) into an oscillating magnetic field with a characteristic pattern across its surface. Here we describe the first results of a dedicated experiment, the Search for Non-Interacting Particles Experimental Hunt (SNIPE Hunt), that aims to detect such dark-matter-induced magnetic-field patterns by performing correlated measurements with a network of magnetometers in relatively quiet magnetic environments (in the wilderness far from human-generated magnetic noise). Our experiment constrains parameter space describing hidden-photon and axion dark matter with Compton frequencies in the 0.5-5.0 Hz range. Limits on the kinetic-mixing parameter for hidden-photon dark matter represent the best experimental bounds to date in this frequency range.

2023-06-20, **Multi-state Dirac stars**, Chen Liang et.al., [2306.11437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11437v1)

 In this paper, we construct the multi-state Dirac stars (MSDSs) consisting of two pairs of Dirac fields. The two pairs of Dirac fields are in the ground state and the first excited state, respectively. Each pair consists of two fields with opposite spins, ensuring spherical symmetry of the system. We discuss the solutions of the MSDSs under synchronized and nonsynchronized frequencies. By varying the mass $\tilde{\mu}\_1$ of the excited state Dirac field and the frequency $\tilde{\omega}\_0$ of the ground state Dirac field, we obtain different types of solutions, including single-branch and double-branch solutions. These two types of solutions do not smoothly transition into each other as the parameters $\tilde{\mu}\_1$ and $\tilde{\omega}\_0$ continuously change, but undergo a sudden transition when $\tilde{\mu}\_1$ ($\tilde{\omega}\_0$) is greater than or less than the threshold value of $0.7694$ ($0.733$). Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of the various MSDSs solutions and analyze the relationship between the ADM mass $M$ of the MSDSs and the synchronized and nonsynchronized frequencies. Subsequently, we calculate the binding energy $E\_B$ of the MSDSs and discuss the stability of the solutions. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of simulating the dark matter halos using MSDSs.

2023-06-20, **Neutron Dark Decay**, Bartosz Fornal et.al., [2306.11349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11349v1)

 There exists a puzzling disagreement between the results for the neutron lifetime obtained in experiments using the beam technique versus those relying on the bottle method. A possible explanation of this discrepancy postulates the existence of a beyond-Standard-Model decay channel of the neutron involving new particles in the final state, some of which can be dark matter candidates. We review the current theoretical status of this proposal and discuss the particle physics models accommodating such a dark decay. We then elaborate on the efforts undertaken to test this hypothesis, summarizing the prospects for probing neutron dark decay channels in future experiments.

2023-06-20, **Horn-array haloscope for volume-efficient broadband axion searches**, Junu Jeong et.al., [2306.11317v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11317v1)

 The invisible axion is a hypothetical particle that arises from the Peccei-Quinn mechanism proposed to resolve the CP problem in quantum chromodynamics, and is considered one of the most favoured candidates for cold dark matter. Dish antennas can provide a useful scheme for sensitive search for dark matter axions. The conversion power through axion-photon couplings is proportional to the surface area of the metal plate, rather than the volume of the available magnetic field. To maximize the effect, we propose an advanced concept of haloscope that involves an array of horn antennae to increase the axion-induced photons and a reflector to focus them onto a photo sensor. Compared to other proposed schemes, this configuration can significantly improve the experimental sensitivity, especially in the terahertz region.

2023-06-21, **Exploring the Evolution of Massive Clumps in Simulations that Reproduce the Observed Milky Way α-element Abundance Bimodality**, Bethany R. Garver et.al., [2306.12388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12388v1)

 The Milky Way stellar disk has both a thin and a thick component. The thin disk is composed mostly of younger stars ($\lesssim$8 Gyr) with a lower abundance of $\alpha$ elements, while the thick disk contains predominantly older stars ($\gtrsim$8--12 Gyr) with a higher $\alpha$ abundance, giving rise to an $\alpha$-bimodality most prominent at intermediate metallicities. A proposed explanation for the bimodality is an episode of clumpy star formation, where high-$\alpha$ stars form in massive clumps that appear in the first few Gyrs of the Milky Way's evolution, while low-$\alpha$ stars form throughout the disk and over a longer time span. To better understand the evolution of clumps, we track them and their constituent stars in two clumpy Milky Way simulations that reproduce the $\alpha$-abundance bimodality, one with 10% and the other with 20% supernova feedback efficiency. We investigate the paths that these clumps take in the chemical space ([O/Fe]--[Fe/H]) as well as their mass, star formation rate (SFR), formation location, lifetime, and merger history. The clumps in the simulation with lower feedback last longer on average, with several lasting hundreds of Myr. Some of the clumps do not reach high-$\alpha$, but the ones that do on average had a higher SFR, longer lifetime, greater mass, and form closer to the galactic center than the ones that do not. Most clumps that reach high-$\alpha$ merge with others and eventually spiral into the galactic center, but shed stars along the way to form most of the thick disk component.

2023-06-21, **Spectroscopy of the Supernova H0pe Host Galaxy at Redshift 1.78**, M. Polletta et.al., [2306.12385v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12385v1)

 Supernova (SN) H0pe was discovered as a new transient in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam images of the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 taken as part of the "Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science" (PEARLS) JWST GTO program (# 1176) on 2023 March 30 (AstroNote 2023-96; Frye et al. 2023). The transient is a compact source associated with a background galaxy that is stretched and triply-imaged by the cluster's strong gravitational lensing. This paper reports spectra in the 950-1370 nm observer frame of two of the galaxy's images obtained with Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) Utility Camera in the Infrared (LUCI) in longslit mode two weeks after the \JWST\ observations. The individual average spectra show the [OII] doublet and the Balmer and 4000 Angstrom breaks at redshift z=1.783+/-0.002. The CIGALE best-fit model of the spectral energy distribution indicates that SN H0pe's host galaxy is massive (Mstar~6x10^10 Msun after correcting for a magnification factor ~7) with a predominant intermediate age (~2 Gyr) stellar population, moderate extinction, and a magnification-corrected star formation rate ~13 Msun/yr, consistent with being below the main sequence of star formation. These properties suggest that H0pe might be a type Ia SN. Additional observations of SN H0pe and its host recently carried out with JWST (JWST-DD-4446; PI: B. Frye) will be able to both determine the SN classification and confirm its association with the galaxy analyzed in this work.

2023-06-21, **Numerical simulations of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo in proto-magnetars**, Paul Barrère et.al., [2306.12296v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12296v1)

 The Tayler-Spruit dynamo is one of the most promising mechanisms proposed to explain angular momentum transport during stellar evolution. Its development in proto-neutron stars spun-up by supernova fallback has also been put forward as a scenario to explain the formation of very magnetized neutron stars called magnetars. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we model the proto-neutron star interior as a stably stratified spherical Couette flow with the outer sphere that rotates faster than the inner one. We report the existence of two subcritical dynamo branches driven by the Tayler instability. They differ by their equatorial symmetry (dipolar or hemispherical) and the magnetic field scaling, which is in agreement with different theoretical predictions (by Fuller and Spruit, respectively). The magnetic dipole of the dipolar branch is found to reach intensities compatible with observational constraints on magnetars.

2023-06-21, **4FGL J1844.4-0306: high-energy emission likely from the supernova remnant G29.37+0.1**, D. Zheng et.al., [2306.12134v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12134v1)

 Very-high-energy (VHE) observations have revealed approximately 100 TeV sources in our Galaxy, and a significant fraction of them are under investigation for understanding their origin. We report our study of one of them, HESS~J1844$-$030. It is found possibly associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G29.37+0.1, and detailed studies of the source region at radio and X-ray frequencies have suggested that this SNR is a composite one, containing a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by a candidate young pulsar. As the GeV source 4FGL~J1844.4$-$0306 is also located in the region with high positional coincidence, we analyze its $\gamma$-ray data obtained with the Large Area Telescope on-board the {\it Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope }. We determine the GeV $\gamma$-ray emission is extended, described with a Log-Parabola function. The obtained spectrum can be connected to that of the VHE source HESS J1844$-$030. Given the properties and those from multi-frequency studies, we discuss the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission by considering that the two \gr\ sources are associated. Our modeling indicates that while the TeV part would have either a hadronic (from the SNR) or a leptonic origin (from the putative PWN), the GeV part would arise from a hadronic process. Thus we conclude that 4FGL~J1844.4$-$0306 is the likely GeV counterpart to G29.37+0.1.

2023-06-21, **Modeling of the nebular-phase spectral evolution of stripped-envelope supernovae. New grids from 100 to 450 days**, Luc Dessart et.al., [2306.12092v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12092v1)

 We present an extended grid of multi-epoch 1D nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations for nebular-phase Type Ibc supernovae (SNe) from He-star explosions. Compared to Dessart+21, we study the spectral evolution from 100 to about 450d and augment the model set with progenitors that were evolved without wind mass loss. Models with the same final, preSN mass have similar yields and produce essentially the same emergent spectra. Hence, the uncertain progenitor mass loss history compromises the inference of the initial, main sequence mass. This shortcoming does not affect Type IIb SNe. However, our 1D models with a different preSN mass tend to yield widely different spectra, as seen through variations in the strong emission lines due to [NII]6548-6583, [OI]6300-6364, [CaII]7291-7323, [NiII]7378, and the forest of FeII lines below 5500A. At the lower mass end, the ejecta are He rich and at 100d cool through HeI, NII, CaII, and FeII lines, with NII and FeII dominating at 450d. These models, associated with He giants, conflict with observed SNe Ib, which typically lack strong NII emission. Instead they may lead to SNe Ibn or, because of additional stripping by a companion star, ultra-stripped SNe Ic. In contrast, for higher preSN masses, the ejecta are progressively He poor and cool at 100d through OI, CaII, and FeII lines, with OI and CaII dominating at 450d. Nonuniform, aspherical, large-scale mixing rather than composition differences likely determines the SN type at intermediate preSN masses. Variations in clumping, mixing, as well as departures from spherical symmetry would increase the spectral diversity but also introduce additional degeneracies. More robust predictions from spectral modeling require a careful attention to the initial conditions informed by physically-consistent 3D explosion models [abridged].

2023-06-21, **A metallicity dependence on the occurrence of core-collapse supernovae**, Thallis Pessi et.al., [2306.11962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11962v1)

 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are widely accepted to be caused by the explosive death of massive stars with initial masses $\gtrsim 8$M$\_\odot$. There is, however, a comparatively poor understanding of how properties of the progenitors -- mass, metallicity, multiplicity, rotation etc. -- manifest in the resultant CCSN population. Here we present a minimally biased sample of nearby CCSNe from the ASAS-SN survey whose host galaxies were observed with integral-field spectroscopy using MUSE at the VLT. This dataset allows us to analyze the explosion sites of CCSNe within the context of global star formation properties across the host galaxies. We show that the CCSN explosion site oxygen abundance distribution is offset to lower values than the overall HII region abundance distribution within the host galaxies. We further show that within the subsample of low-metallicity host galaxies, the CCSNe unbiasedly trace the star-formation with respect to oxygen abundance, while for the sub-sample of higher-metallicity host galaxies, they preferentially occur in lower-abundance star-forming regions. We estimate the occurrence of CCSNe as a function of oxygen abundance per unit star formation, and show that there is a strong decrease as abundance increases. Such a strong and quantified metallicity dependence on CCSN production has not been shown before. Finally, we discuss possible explanations for our result and show that each of these has strong implications for our understanding of CCSNe and massive star evolution.

2023-06-21, **A characterization of ASAS-SN core-collapse supernova environments with VLT+MUSE: I. Sample selection, analysis of local environments, and correlations with light curve properties**, Thallis Pessi et.al., [2306.11961v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11961v1)

 The analysis of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) environments can provide important information on the life cycle of massive stars and constrain the progenitor properties of these powerful explosions. The MUSE instrument at the VLT enables detailed local environment constraints of the progenitors of large samples of CCSNe. Using a homogeneous SN sample from the ASAS-SN survey has enabled us to perform a minimally biased statistical analysis of CCSN environments. We analyze 111 galaxies observed by MUSE that hosted 112 CCSNe detected or discovered by the ASAS-SN survey between 2014 and 2018. The majority of the galaxies were observed by the the AMUSING survey. Here we analyze the immediate environment around the SN locations and compare the properties between the different CCSN types and their light curves. We used stellar population synthesis and spectral fitting techniques to derive physical parameters for all HII regions detected within each galaxy, including the star formation rate (SFR), H$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW), oxygen abundance, and extinction. We found that stripped-envelope (SE) SNe occur in environments with a higher median SFR, H$\alpha$ EW, and oxygen abundances than SNe II and SNe IIn/Ibn. The distributions of SNe II and IIn are very similar, indicating that these events explode in similar environments. For the SESNe, SNe Ic have higher median SFRs, H$\alpha$ EWs, and oxygen abundances than SNe Ib. SNe IIb have environments with similar SFRs and H$\alpha$ EWs to SNe Ib, and similar oxygen abundances to SNe Ic. We also show that the postmaximum decline rate, $s$, of SNe II correlates with the H$\alpha$ EW, and that the luminosity and the $\Delta m\_{15}$ parameter of SESNe correlate with the oxygen abundance, H$\alpha$ EW, and SFR at their environments. This suggests a connection between the explosion mechanisms of these events to their environment properties.

2023-06-20, **A calibration point for stellar evolution from massive star asteroseismology**, Siemen Burssens et.al., [2306.11798v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11798v1)

 Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae, neutron stars and black holes. During the hydrogen-core burning phase their convective cores are the prime drivers of their evolution, but inferences of core masses are subject to unconstrained boundary mixing processes. Moreover, uncalibrated transport mechanisms can lead to strong envelope mixing and differential radial rotation. Ascertaining the efficiency of the transport mechanisms is challenging because of a lack of observational constraints. Here we deduce the convective core mass and robustly demonstrate non-rigid radial rotation in a supernova progenitor, the $12.0^{+1.5}\_{-1.5}$ solar-mass hydrogen-burning star HD 192575, using asteroseismology, TESS photometry, high-resolution spectroscopy, and Gaia astrometry. We infer a convective core mass ($M\_{\rm cc} = 2.9^{+0.5}\_{-0.8}$ solar masses), and find the core to be rotating between 1.4 and 6.3 times faster than the stellar envelope depending on the location of the rotational shear layer. Our results deliver a robust inferred core mass of a massive star using asteroseismology from space-based photometry. HD 192575 is a unique anchor point for studying interior rotation and mixing processes, and thus also angular momentum transport mechanisms inside massive stars.

2023-06-20, **An Asymmetric Double-Degenerate Type Ia Supernova Explosion with a Surviving Companion Star**, Matthew R. Siebert et.al., [2306.11788v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11788v1)

 We present nebular spectroscopy of SN 2020hvf, a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with an early bump in its light curve. SN 2020hvf shares many spectroscopic and photometric similarities to the carbon-rich high-luminosity "03fg-like" SNe Ia. At $>$240 days after peak brightness, we detect unambiguous emission from [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291, 7324 which is never observed in normal-SNe Ia and only seen in peculiar subclasses. SN 2020hvf displays "saw-tooth" emission profiles near 7300 A that cannot be explained with single symmetric velocity components of [Fe II], [Ni II], and [Ca II], indicating an asymmetric explosion. The broad [Ca II] emission is best modeled by two velocity components offset by 1,220 km s$^{-1}$, which could be caused by ejecta associated with each star in the progenitor system, separated by their orbital velocity. For the first time in a SN Ia, we identify narrow (${\rm FWHM} = 180\pm40$ km s$^{-1}$) [Ca II] emission, which we associate with a wind from a surviving, puffed-up companion star. Few published spectra have sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise ratio necessary to detect similar narrow [Ca II] emission, however, we have detected similar line profiles in other 03fg-like SNe Ia. The extremely narrow velocity width of [Ca II] has only otherwise been observed in SNe Iax at late times. Since this event likely had a double-degenerate "super-Chandrasekhar" mass progenitor system, we suggest that a single white dwarf (WD) was fully disrupted and a wind from a surviving companion WD is producing the observed narrow emission. It is unclear if this unique progenitor and explosion scenario can explain the diversity of 03fg-like SNe Ia, potentially indicating that multiple progenitor channels contribute to this subclass.

2023-06-20, **Very Massive Stars and Pair-Instability Supernovae: Mass-loss Framework for low Metallicity**, Gautham N. Sabhahit et.al., [2306.11785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11785v1)

 Very massive stars (VMS) up to 200-300 $M\_\odot$ have been found in the Local Universe. If they would lose little mass they produce intermediate-mass black holes or pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). Until now, VMS modellers have extrapolated mass-loss vs. metallicity ($Z$) exponents from optically-thin winds, resulting in a range of PISN thresholds that might be unrealistically high in $Z$, as VMS develop optically-thick winds. We utilize the transition mass-loss rate of Vink and Gr\"afener (2012) that accurately predicts mass-loss rates of Of/WNh ("slash") stars that characterize the morphological transition from absorption-dominated O-type spectra to emission-dominated WNh spectra. We develop a wind efficiency framework, where optically thin winds transition to enhanced winds, enabling us to study VMS evolution at high redshift where individual stars cannot be resolved. We present a MESA grid covering $Z\_\odot/2$ to $Z\_\odot/100$. VMS above the transition evolve towards lower luminosity, skipping the cool supergiant phase but directly forming pure He stars at the end of hydrogen burning. Below the transition, VMS evolve as cooler luminous blue variables (LBVs) or yellow hypergiants (YHGs), naturally approaching the Eddington limit. Strong winds in this YHG/LBV regime -- combined with a degeneracy in luminosity -- result in a mass-loss runaway where a decrease in mass increases wind mass loss. Our models indicate an order-of-magnitude lower threshold than usually assumed, at $Z\_\odot/20$ due to our mass-loss runaway. While future work on LBV mass loss could affect the PISN threshold, our framework will be critical for establishing definitive answers on the PISN threshold and galactic chemical evolution modelling.

2023-06-20, **Neural Astrophysical Wind Models**, Dustin D. Nguyen et.al., [2306.11666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11666v1)

 The bulk kinematics and thermodynamics of hot supernovae-driven galactic winds is critically dependent on both the amount of swept up cool clouds and non-spherical collimated flow geometry. However, accurately parameterizing these physics is difficult because their functional forms are often unknown, and because the coupled non-linear flow equations contain singularities. We show that deep neural networks embedded as individual terms in the governing coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can robustly discover both of these physics, without any prior knowledge of the true function structure, as a supervised learning task. We optimize a loss function based on the Mach number, rather than the explicitly solved-for 3 conserved variables, and apply a penalty term towards near-diverging solutions. The same neural network architecture is used for learning both the hidden mass-loading and surface area expansion rates. This work further highlights the feasibility of neural ODEs as a promising discovery tool with mechanistic interpretability for non-linear inverse problems.

2023-06-20, **Not so fast, not so furious: just magnetic**, Landstreet et.al., [2306.11663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11663v1)

 WD0810-353 is a white dwarf within the 20pc volume around the Sun. Using Gaia astrometric distance and proper motions, and a radial velocity derived from Gaia spectroscopy, it has been predicted that this star will pass within 1pc of the Solar System in about 30kyr. However, WD0810-353 has been also shown to host a magnetic field with strength of the order of 30MG. Its spectrum is therefore not like those of normal DA stars of similar effective temperature. We have obtained and analysed new polarised spectra of the star around Halpha. Our analysis suggests that the visible surface of the star shows two regions of different field strength (~30 and ~45MG, respectively), and opposite polarity. The spectra do not change over a 4 year time span, meaning that either the stellar rotation period is no shorter than several decades, or that the field is symmetric about the rotation axis. Taking into account magnetic shift and splitting, we obtain an estimate of the radial velocity of the star (+83+/- 140km/s); we reject both the value an the claimed precision deduced from the Gaia DR3 spectroscopy (-373.7+/- 8.2km/s), and we conclude that there will probably be no close encounter between the Solar System and WD0810-353. We also reject the suggestion that the star is a hypervelocity runaway star, a survivor of a Type Ia Supernova explosion. It is just a stellar remnant in the Solar neighborhood with a very strong and complex magnetic field.

2023-06-20, **A Machine Learning Approach to Galactic Emission-Line Region Classification**, Carter Lee Rhea et.al., [2306.11545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11545v1)

 Diagnostic diagrams of emission-line ratios have been used extensively to categorize extragalactic emission regions; however, these diagnostics are occasionally at odds with each other due to differing definitions. In this work, we study the applicability of supervised machine-learning techniques to systematically classify emission-line regions from the ratios of certain emission lines. Using the Million Mexican Model database, which contains information from grids of photoionization models using \texttt{cloudy}, and from shock models, we develop training and test sets of emission line fluxes for three key diagnostic ratios. The sets are created for three classifications: classic \hii{} regions, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants. We train a neural network to classify a region as one of the three classes defined above given three key line ratios that are present both in the SITELLE and MUSE instruments' band-passes: [{\sc O\,iii}]$\lambda5007$/H$\beta$, [{\sc N\,ii}]$\lambda6583$/H$\alpha$, ([{\sc S\,ii}]$\lambda6717$+[{\sc S\,ii}]$\lambda6731$)/H$\alpha$. We also tested the impact of the addition of the [{\sc O\,ii}]$\lambda3726,3729$/[{\sc O\,iii}]$\lambda5007$ line ratio when available for the classification. A maximum luminosity limit is introduced to improve the classification of the planetary nebulae. Furthermore, the network is applied to SITELLE observations of a prominent field of M33. We discuss where the network succeeds and why it fails in certain cases. Our results provide a framework for the use of machine learning as a tool for the classification of extragalactic emission regions. Further work is needed to build more comprehensive training sets and adapt the method to additional observational constraints.

 The $\gamma$-process nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae is generally accepted as a feasible process for the synthesis of neutron-deficient isotopes beyond iron. However, crucial discrepancies between theory and observations still exist: the average production of $\gamma$-process yields from massive stars are too low to reproduce the solar distribution in galactic chemical evolution calculations, and the yields of the Mo and Ru isotopes are by a further factor of 10 lower than the yields of the other $\gamma$-process nuclei. We investigate the $\gamma$-process in 5 sets of core-collapse supernova models published in literature with initial masses 15, 20, and 25 M$\_{\odot}$ at solar metallicity. We compared the $\gamma$-process overproduction factors from the different models. To highlight the possible effect of nuclear physics input, we also considered 23 ratios of two isotopes close to each other in mass, relative to their solar values. Further, we investigated the contribution of C-O shell mergers in the supernova progenitors as an additional site of the $\gamma$-process. Our analysis shows that a large scatter among the different models exists for both the $\gamma$-process integrated yields and the isotopic ratios. We found only 10 ratios that agree with their solar values, all the others differ by at least a factor of 3 from the solar values in all the considered sets of models. The $\gamma$-process within C-O shell mergers mostly influence the isotopic ratios that involve intermediate and heavy proton-rich isotopes with $\rm A>100$.
