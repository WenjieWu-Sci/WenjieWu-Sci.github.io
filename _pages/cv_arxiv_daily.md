2024-03-18, **Resolving the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions with neutrino mass and chemical potential**, Shek Yeung et.al., [2403.11499v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11499v1)

 A simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is to allow relic neutrinos to have non-zero degeneracy. We confront this $\Lambda$CDM$\xi$ model, $\Lambda$CDM with neutrino mass $M\_\nu$ and degeneracy $\xi\_3$ as additional parameters, with the \textit{Planck} TT, lowT, plik--lensing, BAO, and DES datasets, and we observe a strong preference (Bayes factor $\log\_{10}B=1.9$) for it over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Both the $H\_0$ and $S\_8$ tensions are resolved to within 1$\sigma$ with the same set of neutrino parameters, along with 3$\sigma$ evidence for nonzero neutrino mass ($M\_\nu=0.58^{+0.17}\_{-0.13}\ \mathrm{eV}$) and degeneracy ($\xi\_3=1.27^{+0.42}\_{-0.22}$). Furthermore, our analysis favors the scalar index $n\_s$ to be slightly larger than 1, compatible with some hybrid inflation models, as well as a significantly larger optical depth $\tau$ than the standard Planck value, indicating an earlier onset of reionization.

2024-03-17, **$T_7$ Flavor Symmetry gym: The Key to Unlocking the Neutrino Mass Puzzle**, M. W. Aslam et.al., [2403.11177v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11177v1)

 Recent research has indicated that the Standard Model (SM), while historically highly effective, is found to be insufficient due to its prediction of zero mass for neutrinos. With the exception of a few, the majority of the parameters related to neutrinos have been determined by neutrino oscillation experiments with excellent precision. Experiments on neutrino oscillation and neutrino mixing have shown that neutrinos are massive. To fill in gaps, discrete symmetries are becoming more common alongside continuous symmetries while describing the observed pattern of neutrino mixing. Here, we present a $T\_7$ flavor symmetry to explain the masses of charged leptons and neutrinos. The light neutrino mass matrix is derived using seesaw mechanism of type I, which involves the Dirac neutrino mass matrix as well as the right-handed neutrino mass matrix. We estimate the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix ($U\_{PMNS}$), three mixing angles, $\theta\_{12}$, $\theta\_{23}$ and $\theta\_{13}$, which are strongly correlated with the recent experimental results. The extent of $CP$ violation in neutrino oscillations is obtained by calculating Jarskog invariant $(J\_{CP})$ on the behalf of $U\_{PMNS}$. We also find the masses of three neutrinos and Effective Majorana neutrino mass parameter $\langle m\_{ee} \rangle$ which is $1.0960244138965946$ $meV$ and $10.92168920244218$ $meV$ for normal and inverted hierarchy, respectively.

2024-03-18, **ARTEMIS emulator: exploring the effect of cosmology and galaxy formation physics on Milky Way-mass haloes and their satellites**, Shaun T. Brown et.al., [2403.11692v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11692v1)

 We present the new ARTEMIS emulator suite of high resolution (baryon mass of $2.23 \times 10^{4}$ $h^{-1}$M$\_{\odot}$) zoom-in simulations of Milky Way mass systems. Here, three haloes from the original ARTEMIS sample have been rerun multiple times, systematically varying parameters for the stellar feedback model, the density threshold for star formation, the reionisation redshift and the assumed warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass (assuming a thermal relic). From these simulations emulators are trained for a wide range of statistics that allow for fast predictions at combinations of parameters not originally sampled, running in $\sim 1$ms (a factor of $\sim 10^{11}$ faster than the simulations). In this paper we explore the dependence of the central haloes' stellar mass on the varied parameters, finding the stellar feedback parameters to be the most important. When constraining the parameters to match the present-day stellar mass halo mass relation inferred from abundance matching we find that there is a strong degeneracy in the stellar feedback parameters, corresponding to a freedom in formation time of the stellar component for a fixed halo assembly history. We additionally explore the dependence of the satellite stellar mass function, where it is found that variations in stellar feedback, the reionisation redshift and the WDM mass all have a significant effect. The presented emulators are a powerful tool which allows for fundamentally new ways of analysing and interpreting cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Crucially, allowing their free (subgrid) parameters to be varied and marginalised, leading to more robust constraints and predictions.

2024-03-18, **Tidal Formation of dark matter deficit diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 by SIDM**, Zhao-Chen Zhang et.al., [2403.11403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11403v1)

 Observations have revealed a significant dark matter deficit in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 (DF2). It is widely accepted that the formation of this unique galaxy can be attributed to the tidal stripping of its host galaxy, NGC1052. In this study, we simulate the evolution of a satellite system containing globular clusters (GCs) within an accreting host halo in the framework of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Our simulation results suggest that the heightened tidal stripping resulting from self-interaction can give rise to the transformation of a conventional dwarf galaxy into a galaxy resembling DF2 in all its observed properties. By comparing the simulation results with identical initial conditions in both the standard cold dark matter (CDM) and SIDM models, we find that the latter is more likely to replicate the properties of DF2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a DF2 analog can also be produced on an orbit with a greater pericenter distance by increasing the strength of self-interaction. This suggests that the issue of extreme orbital parameters can be mitigated by implementing the SIDM model. The distributions of the GC population derived in our SIDM simulation are consistent with the observed characteristics of DF2. For comparison, we also explored the potential for achieving GC distributions in the context of CDM.

2024-03-17, **The redshift evolution of primordial black hole merger rate**, Viktor Stasenko et.al., [2403.11325v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11325v1)

 The gravitational wave signals detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration can be explained by mergers of binary primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the radiation dominated epoch. However, in early structures induced by the Poisson distribution of PBHs, a significant fraction of binaries are perturbed and avoid mergers. In addition, the internal dynamics of early halos lead to the formation of dense primordial black hole clusters within a few Hubble times from the moment of halo formation. In such clusters PBH binaries are effectively formed and their mergers potentially dominate in the modern era. We obtained that the PBH merger rate changes with redshift as $\mathcal{R} \propto (1 + z)^\beta$, where $\beta = 1.4 - 2.2$ reflects the influence of PBH clustering and depends on both $z$ and $f\_{\rm PBH}$. The observed merger rate constraints the fraction of PBHs of tens solar masses in the composition of dark matter $f\_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 0.001 - 0.1$ in dependence of the clustering efficiency.

2024-03-18, **Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae I. Measurements and temporal evolution**, Santiago González-Gaitán et.al., [2403.11677v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11677v1)

 Narrow absorption features in nearby supernova (SN) spectra are a powerful diagnostic of the slow-moving material in the line of sight: they are extensively used to infer dust extinction from the host galaxies, and they can also serve in the detection of circumstellar material originating from the SN progenitor and present in the vicinity of the explosion. Despite their wide use, very few studies have examined the biases of the methods to characterize narrow lines, and not many statistical analyses exist. This is the first paper of a series in which we present a statistical analysis of narrow lines of SN spectra of various resolutions. We develop a robust automated methodology to measure the equivalent width (EW) and velocity of narrow absorption lines from intervening material in the line of sight of SNe, including Na I D , Ca II H&K, K i and diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). We carefully study systematic biases in heterogeneous spectra from the literature by simulating different signal-to-noise, spectral resolution, slit size and orientation and present the real capabilities and limitations of using low- and mid-resolution spectra to study these lines. In particular, we find that the measurement of the equivalent width of the narrow lines in low-resolution spectra is highly affected by the evolving broad P-Cygni profiles of the SN ejecta, both for core-collapse and type Ia SNe, inducing a conspicuous apparent evolution. We present thus an easy way to detect and exclude those cases to obtain more robust and reliable measurements. Finally, after considering all possible effects, we analyse the temporal evolution of the narrow features in a large sample of nearby SNe to detect any possible variation in their EWs over time. We find no time evolution of the narrow line features in our large sample for all SN types
