2026-01-12, **Performance Benchmarks for 2-View and 3-View Fiber-Projection Fine-Grained Particle Detectors**, Haohui Che et.al., [2601.07633v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07633v1)

 Fine-grained scintillator detectors are critical for precision measurements in nuclear and particle physics, where accurate reconstruction of interaction vertices and secondary particle directions enables separation of signal from background events. A well-known design choice is the fiber readout geometry: traditional 2-View systems use orthogonal X and Y fibers, while next-generation 3-View designs add a third Z-fiber layer that provides unambiguous 3D voxel identification. The 2-View approach suffers from combinatorial ghost hits, that the false 3D candidates arising from fiber projection ambiguities, degrading reconstruction performance in high-multiplicity events. This paper presents comprehensive simulation benchmarks quantifying the performance difference between 2-View and 3-View geometries across key metrics. We find that the 3-View geometry reduces ghost hits by 30--90\% depending on event topology, provides robust vertex resolution across complex topologies, and maintains superior angular resolution for shower direction reconstruction. These benchmarks inform the design optimization of future detectors and provide quantitative guidance for reconstruction algorithm development across a broad range of experiments including neutrino physics, rare kaon/pion decays, and collider calorimetry.

2026-01-12, **Deep Search for Joint Sources of Gravitational Waves and High-Energy Neutrinos with IceCube During the Third Observing Run of LIGO and Virgo**, The IceCube Collaboration et.al., [2601.07595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07595v1)

 The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, from the dynamics of compact object mergers and stellar collapses to the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources. Our results constrain the isotropic neutrino emission from gravitational-wave sources for very high values of the total energy emitted in neutrinos (> $10^{52} - 10^{54}$ erg).

2026-01-12, **Cosmic rays, gamma rays and neutrinos from discrete black hole X-ray binary ejecta**, Nicolas J. Bacon et.al., [2601.07589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07589v1)

 The origin of cosmic rays from outside the Solar system are unknown, as they are deflected by the interstellar magnetic field. Supernova remnants are the main candidate for cosmic rays up to PeV energies but due to lack of evidence, they cannot be concluded as the sources of the most energetic Galactic CRs. We investigate discrete ejecta produced in state transitions of black hole X-ray binary systems as a potential source of cosmic rays, motivated by recent $>100$ TeV $γ$-ray detections by LHAASO. Starting from MAXI J1820+070, we examine the multi-wavelength observations and find that efficient particle acceleration may take place (i.e. into a robust power-law), up to $\sim2\times 10^{16}μ^{-1/2}$ eV, where $μ$ is the ratio of particle energy to magnetic energy. From these calculations, we estimate the global contribution of ejecta to the entire Galactic spectrum to be $\sim1\%$, with the cosmic ray contribution rising to $\sim5\%$ at PeV energies, assuming roughly equal energy in non-thermal protons, non-thermal electrons and magnetic fields. In addition, we calculate associated $γ$-ray and neutrino spectra of the MAXI J1820+070 ejecta to investigate new detection methods with CTAO, which provide strong constraints on initial ejecta size of order $10^7$ Schwarzschild radii ($10^{-5}$ pc) assuming a period of adiabatic expansion.

2026-01-12, **CP violating signal at DUNE in presence of nonstandard interactions and the role of second oscillation maxima**, Rajrupa Banerjee et.al., [2601.07435v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07435v1)

 Neutrino oscillation among the three active neutrino flavors is well established and supported by experiments at diverse length scales and energy scales. It may be noted that five of the neutrino oscillation parameters in the three-flavor paradigm, namely the three mixing angles ($θ\_{12}$, $θ\_{13}$, $θ\_{23}$) and the two mass-squared differences ($Δm^{2}\_{21}$, $Δm^{2}\_{31}$) are measured to a reasonable degree of precision. The three unknowns that are expected to be deciphered in the near future are the Dirac CP phase, $δ$, the neutrino mass ordering, and the octant of $θ\_{23}$. The next generation of long baseline experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), aims to resolve these unanswered questions. In the present work, by considering DUNE as an example, we assess the ability of long baseline experiments to extricate the intrinsic contribution from observables related to CP violation in scenarios considering SI and beyond. Additionally, we analyze the role of the second oscillation maximum in addressing the above mentioned questions. By carrying out event level and statistical analyses, we assess the potential of DUNE to probe CP violation effects both within and beyond the standard paradigm.

 The elemental abundances of the Fe-peak elements (such as Cr, Mn, Fe and Ni) and Ti are important for understanding the environment of explosive nuclear burning for the core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe). In particular, the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, which is well known for its asymmetric structure, contains three ``Fe-rich blobs,'' and the composition of the Fe-peak elements within these structures could be related to the asymmetry of the supernova explosion. We report a highly asymmetric distribution of the Fe-peak elements in Cassiopeia A as revealed by XRISM observations. We found that the southeastern Fe-rich region has a significant Mn emission above the 4$σ$ confidence level, while the northwestern Fe-rich region has no clear signature. In addition to the significant difference in Mn abundance across these regions, our observations show that the Ti/Fe, Mn/Cr, and Ni/Fe ratios vary from region to region. The observed asymmetric distribution of Fe-peak elements could be produced by (1) the mixing of materials from different burning layers of the supernova, (2) the asymmetric distribution of the electron fraction in the progenitor star and/or (3) the local dependence of the neutrino irradiation in the supernova innermost region. Future spatially resolved spectroscopy of Cassiopeia A using X-ray microcalorimeters will enable more detailed measurements of the distribution and composition of these elements, providing a unique tool for testing asymmetric supernova physics.

2026-01-12, **Atmospheric Mass-Squared Splitting at Sub-Percent Precision as a $CPT$ Symmetry Probe**, T. V. Ngoc et.al., [2601.07269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07269v1)

 In this paper, we present an improved test of $CPT$ symmetry in the neutrino sector by analyzing the atmospheric mass-squared splittings, $Δm^2\_{31}$ and $Δ\overline{m}^2\_{31}$, using on-going JUNO and future DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande experiments. Our study focuses on the discrepancy $δ\_{ν\overlineν}(Δm^2\_{31}) = Δm^2\_{31} - Δ\overline{m}^2\_{31}$, achieving unprecedented precision by exploiting the high statistics and reduced systematic uncertainties of these facilities. The combined analysis yields a sensitivity to $CPT$ violation at the level of $2\times 10^{-5}~\text{eV}^2$ at $3σ$ confidence level, representing a $60\%$ improvement over the joint T2K-NO$ν$A-JUNO analysis. These results highlight the crucial role of multi-experiment synergies in testing fundamental symmetries of nature.

2026-01-11, **Probing Dark Matter annihilation in the Galactic Centre with TRIDENT**, Yingwei Wang et.al., [2601.06817v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06817v1)

 We determine the future sensitivity of the TRIDENT neutrino telescope to dark matter annihilation in the Galactic Centre. By applying the full detector design we show that TRIDENT will probe annihilation rates down to $\langleσv\rangle\approx5\times10^{-27}\,{\rm cm}^3\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ for a $10\,{\rm TeV}$ dark matter, which is below the thermal freeze-out benchmark. The analysis is carried out with all-flavour neutrino interactions, where we demonstrate that cascade events, primarily due to $ν\_{e,τ}$, show greater sensitivity to a dark matter signal compared to the more commonly studied track events. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of a previously overlooked background, Galactic neutrinos produced from interactions between hadronic cosmic rays and interstellar gas. We find dark matter sensitivities are more strongly degraded in the high energy region above $\sim 10\, {\rm TeV}$, with a maximal weakening of approximately a factor of $\sim 2$. This effect remains smaller than the uncertainty associated with the dark matter density profile but can nonetheless mimic a positive annihilation signal. We contextualize these results with a concrete particle model and show that TRIDENT will be able to probe the most interesting untested parts of parameter space.

2026-01-12, **Testing subhalo abundance matching with galaxy kinematics**, Fedir Boreiko et.al., [2601.07799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07799v1)

 The rotation velocities of disc galaxies trace dark matter halo structure, providing direct constraints on the galaxy--halo connection. We construct a Bayesian forward model to connect the dark matter halo population predicted by $Λ$CDM with an observed sample of disc galaxies (SPARC) through their maximum rotation velocities. Our approach combines a subhalo abundance matching scheme (accounting for assembly bias) with a parameterised halo response to galaxy formation. When assuming no correlation between selection in the SPARC survey and halo properties, reproducing the observed velocities requires strong halo expansion, low abundance matching scatter ($<0.15$ dex at $1σ$) and a halo proxy that strongly suppresses the stellar masses in satellite haloes. This is in clear tension with independent clustering constraints. Allowing for SPARC-like galaxies to preferentially populate low $\Vmax$ haloes at fixed virial mass greatly improves the goodness-of-fit and resolves these tensions: the preferred halo response shifts to mild contraction, the abundance matching scatter increases to $\sint = 0.19^{+0.13}\_{-0.11}$ dex and the proxy becomes consistent with clustering. However, the inferred selection threshold is extreme, implying that SPARC galaxies occupy the lowest ${\sim}16$ per cent of the $\Vmaxhalo$ distribution at fixed $\Mvir$. Moreover, even with selection, the inferred scatter remains in statistical disagreement with the low-mass clustering constraints, which are most representative of the SPARC galaxies in our sample. Our analysis highlights the advantage of augmenting clustering-based constraints on the galaxy--halo connection with kinematics and suggests a possible tension using current data.

2026-01-12, **Euclid preparation. Testing analytic models of galaxy intrinsic alignments in the Euclid Flagship simulation**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2601.07784v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07784v1)

 We model intrinsic alignments (IA) in Euclid's Flagship simulation to investigate its impact on Euclid's weak lensing signal. Our IA implementation in the Flagship simulation takes into account photometric properties of galaxies as well as their dark matter host halos. We compare simulations against theory predictions, determining the parameters of two of the most widely used IA models: the Non Linear Alignment (NLA) and the Tidal Alignment and Tidal Torquing (TATT) models. We measure the amplitude of the simulated IA signal as a function of galaxy magnitude and colour in the redshift range $0.1<z<2.1$. We find that both NLA and TATT can accurately describe the IA signal in the simulation down to scales of $6$-$7 \,h^{-1}\,$Mpc. We measure alignment amplitudes for red galaxies comparable to those of the observations, with samples not used in the calibration procedure. For blue galaxies, our constraints are consistent with zero alignments in our first redshift bin $0.1 < z < 0.3$, but we detect a non-negligible signal at higher redshift, which is, however, consistent with the upper limits set by observational constraints. Additionally, several hydrodynamical simulations predict alignment for spiral galaxies, in agreement with our findings. Finally, the evolution of alignment with redshift is realistic and comparable to that determined in the observations. However, we find that the commonly adopted redshift power-law for IA fails to reproduce the simulation alignments above $z=1.1$. A significantly better agreement is obtained when a luminosity dependence is included, capturing the intrinsic luminosity evolution with redshift in magnitude-limited surveys. We conclude that the Flagship IA simulation is a useful tool for translating current IA constraints into predictions for IA contamination of Euclid-like samples.

2026-01-12, **Tachyonic gravitational dark matter production after inflation**, Giorgio Laverda et.al., [2601.07670v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07670v1)

 We propose a novel gravitational mechanism for the non-thermal production of dark matter driven by curvature-induced tachyonic instabilities after inflation. Departing from the commonly studied non-minimal couplings to gravity, our framework considers a real spectator scalar field coupled quadratically to spacetime curvature invariants. We show that the rapid reorganization of spacetime curvature at the end of inflation can dynamically render the dark matter field tachyonic, triggering a short-lived phase of spontaneous symmetry breaking and explosive particle production. As a concrete and theoretically controlled example, we focus on the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. By combining analytical estimates with fully non-linear $3+1$ classical lattice simulations, we track the out-of-equilibrium evolution of the system and compute the resulting dark matter abundance. We find that this purely gravitational mechanism can robustly reproduce the observed dark matter relic density over a wide range of masses and inflationary scales, providing also a simple fitting function that enables a lattice-independent application of our results.

2026-01-12, **CASCO: Cosmological and AStrophysical parameters from Cosmological simulations and Observations IV. Testing warm dark matter cosmologies with galaxy scaling relations: A joint simulation-observation study using DREAMS simulations**, M. Silvestrini et.al., [2601.07543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07543v1)

 Small-scale discrepancies in the standard Lambda cold dark matter paradigm have motivated the exploration of alternative dark matter (DM) models, such as warm dark matter (WDM). We investigate the constraining power of galaxy scaling relations on cosmological, astrophysical, and WDM parameters through a joint analysis of hydrodynamic simulations and observational data. Our study is based on the DREAMS project and combines large-volume uniform-box simulations with high-resolution Milky Way zoom-in runs in a $Λ$WDM cosmology. To ensure consistency between the different simulation sets, we apply calibrations to account for resolution effects, allowing us to exploit the complementary strengths of the two suites. We compare simulated relations, including stellar size, DM mass and fraction within the stellar half-mass radius, and the total-to-stellar mass ratio, with two complementary galaxy samples: the SPARC catalog of nearby spirals and the LVDB catalog of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume. Using a bootstrap-based fitting procedure, we show that key cosmological parameters ($Ω\_m$, $σ\_8$) and supernova feedback strength can be recovered with good accuracy, particularly from the uniform-box simulations. While the WDM particle mass remains unconstrained, the zoom-in simulations reveal subtle WDM-induced trends at low stellar masses in both the DM mass and total-to-stellar mass ratio. We also find that the galaxy stellar mass function exhibits a measurable dependence on the WDM particle mass below log10(M\_*/Msun) <~ 8, which appears separable from the impact of feedback, suggesting it as a promising complementary probe. Our results highlight the importance of combining multi-resolution simulations with diverse observational datasets to jointly constrain baryonic processes and DM properties.

2026-01-12, **Strong Evidence for Dark Sector Interactions**, Tian-Nuo Li et.al., [2601.07361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07361v1)

 Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data reveal deviations from $Λ$CDM cosmology, conventionally attributed to dynamical dark energy (DE). We demonstrate that these deviations are equally, if not better, explained by interactions between dark matter and dark energy (IDE), without requiring a time-varying DE equation of state. Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models--coupled quintessence and coupled fluid--against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$σ$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $Λ$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms.

2026-01-12, **More power on large scales**, Jeremy Mould et.al., [2601.07106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07106v1)

 The high value of the cosmic microwave dipole may be telling us that dark matter is macroscopic rather than a fundamental particle. The possible presence of a significant dark matter component in the form of primordial black holes suggests that dark halo formation simulations should be commenced well before redshift z = 100. Unlike standard CDM candidates, PBHs behave as dense, non-relativistic matter from their inception in the radiation-dominated era. This allows them to seed gravitational potential wells and begin clustering earlier. We find that starting N-body simulations at redshifts even before matter-radiation equality yield galaxy bulk flow velocities that are systematically larger than those predicted by standard LCDM models. The early, high-mass concentrations established by PBHs lead to a more rapid and efficient gravitational acceleration of surrounding baryonic and dark matter, generating larger peculiar velocities that remain coherent over scales of hundreds of Mpc. Furthermore, a sub- population of PBHs in the 10^-20 to 10^-17 solar mass range would lose a non-negligible fraction of their mass via Hawking radiation over cosmological timescales. This evaporation process converts matter into radiation, so a time-varying matter density parameter, Omega\_m', is introduced, which behaves like a boosted radiation term in the Friedmann equation. This dynamic term acts to reduce the Hubble tension. A higher effective Omega\_r in the early universe reduces the sound horizon at the epoch of recombination. PBH mass loss also influences fits to the equation of state parameter, w, at low redshift. The naive N-body modelling presented here suggests investigation with tried and tested cosmology codes should be carried out, by introducing mass losing PBHs and starting the evolution as early as practicable.

2026-01-11, **Viable f(R) Scenarios Unifying Inflation with Realistic Dynamical Dark Energy**, S. D. Odintsov et.al., [2601.06949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06949v1)

 Two $F(R)$ gravity models are tested on the basis of their viability during all stages of cosmological evolution. It is shown that these models can describe both the early-time inflationary epoch and the dark energy epoch. The models are confronted with the latest observational data, including the Pantheon+ catalogue with Type Ia supernovae, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, the Hubble parameter estimations and data from cosmic microwave background radiation. Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\frac{dF}{dR}>0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models. However the best fitted parameters, determined in confrontation with the mentioned observational data, lie far from the forbidden domains for both models. These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $Λ$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $χ^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. This success of the two $F(R)$ gravity scenarios is connected with their capability to mimic dynamical dark energy, similarly to models with variable equation of state, that is necessary for describing the latest Pantheon+ and DESI observational data.

2026-01-11, **Axion Signal Search Using Hybrid Nuclear-Electronic Spin Systems**, Xiangjun Tan et.al., [2601.06816v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06816v1)

 Conventional nuclear magnetic resonance searches for the galactic axion wind lose sensitivity at low frequencies due to the unfavourable scaling of inductive readout. Here, we propose a hybrid architecture where the hyperfine interaction transduces axion-driven nuclear precession into a high-bandwidth electron-spin readout channel. We demonstrate analytically that this dispersive upconversion preserves the specific sidereal and annual modulation signatures required to distinguish dark matter signals from instrumental backgrounds. When instantiated in a silicon ${ }^{209} \text{Bi}$ donor platform, the hybrid sensor is projected to outperform direct nuclear detection by more than an order of magnitude over the $10^{-16}-10^{-6} \text{eV}$ wide mass range. With collective enhancement, the design reaches a $5 σ$ sensitivity to DFSZ axion-nucleon couplings within one year, establishing hyperfine-mediated sensing as a competitive path for compact, solid-state dark matter searches.

2026-01-12, **A COLIBRI Photometric Study of SN 2025bvm: A Normal, Slowly Declining Type Ia Supernova**, Diego Hernando Gonzalez-Buitrago et.al., [2601.07745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07745v1)

 We present 121 days of multi-band (\Bband, \gband, \rband, \iband) optical photometry of the Type Ia supernova SN 2025bvm, obtained with the COLIBRI telescope at OAN-SPM. The light curves show a photometric decline of $Δm\_{15}(B) = 0.867 \pm 0.051$~mag, characteristic of a slow-declining Type Ia supernova. After correcting for host galaxy extinction ($E(B-V)\_{host} = 0.308 \pm 0.030$~mag) and adopting a distance of 70~Mpc, we derive a peak absolute magnitude of $M\_B = -19.13 \pm 0.40$~mag. This luminosity is fully consistent with its slow decline rate, placing SN 2025bvm within the population of normal Type Ia supernovae. We conclude that SN 2025bvm is a normal Type Ia supernova, whose photometric properties, such as a slow late-time decline and a prominent \iband-band secondary maximum, suggest an explosion that resulted in a particularly massive ejecta.

2026-01-12, **CASCO: Cosmological and AStrophysical parameters from Cosmological simulations and Observations IV. Testing warm dark matter cosmologies with galaxy scaling relations: A joint simulation-observation study using DREAMS simulations**, M. Silvestrini et.al., [2601.07543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07543v1)

 Small-scale discrepancies in the standard Lambda cold dark matter paradigm have motivated the exploration of alternative dark matter (DM) models, such as warm dark matter (WDM). We investigate the constraining power of galaxy scaling relations on cosmological, astrophysical, and WDM parameters through a joint analysis of hydrodynamic simulations and observational data.

Using a bootstrap-based fitting procedure, we show that key cosmological parameters ($Ω\_m$, $σ\_8$) and supernova feedback strength can be recovered with good accuracy, particularly from the uniform-box simulations. While the WDM particle mass remains unconstrained, the zoom-in simulations reveal subtle WDM-induced trends at low stellar masses in both the DM mass and total-to-stellar mass ratio. We also find that the galaxy stellar mass function exhibits a measurable dependence on the WDM particle mass below log10(M\_*/Msun) <~ 8, which appears separable from the impact of feedback, suggesting it as a promising complementary probe. Our results highlight the importance of combining multi-resolution simulations with diverse observational datasets to jointly constrain baryonic processes and DM properties.

2026-01-12, **Revealing the diversity of Type IIn supernova progenitors through their environments**, Zexi Niu et.al., [2601.07542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07542v1)

 Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are hydrogen-rich explosions embedded in dense circumstellar medium (CSM), which gives rise to their characteristic narrow hydrogen emission lines. The nature of their progenitors and pre-explosion mass loss remains, however, poorly understood. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we analyze the local stellar environments of a volume-limited sample (z < 0.02) of 31 SNe IIn. The environments of SNe IIn are found to be very diverse; the SN could reside within a star-forming region (Class 1), outside a star-forming region (Class 2), or in much older environments without any obvious signs of star formation (Class 3). The bright SNe IIn (Mpeak < -19.5 mag) predominantly occur in Class 1 environments, indicative of very massive progenitors, while the faint SNe IIn (Mpeak < -15.5 mag) are associated with Classes 2 and 3 environments, suggesting the least massive progenitors. Meanwhile, normal SNe IIn with -19.5 < Mpeak < -15.5 mag occur in all three types of environments, suggesting a diversity in their progenitor mass, lifetime, and evolutionary pathways. Moreover, the directly detected SN IIn progenitors are systematically brighter and/or bluer than the youngest stellar populations in their environments, suggesting that they were either in a non-quiescent state when observed or had experienced binary interactions. These results point to a significantly diverse origin for progenitors of SNe IIn, spanning a wide range of masses, evolutionary stages, and potential binary interaction histories.

2026-01-12, **A Study of Two Type IIb Supernovae: SNe 2008aq and 2019gaf**, Mridweeka Singh et.al., [2601.07450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07450v1)

 We present photometric and spectroscopic studies of two core-collapse supernovae (SNe) 2008aq and 2019gaf in the optical wavelengths. Light curve and spectral sequence of both the SNe are similar to those of other Type IIb SNe. The pre-maximum spectrum of SN~2008aq showed prominent H $α$ lines, the He lines started appearing in the near maximum spectrum. The near maximum spectrum of SN~2019gaf shows shallow H$α$ absorption and He lines with almost similar strength. Both the SNe show transition from hydrogen-dominated spectra to helium-dominated spectra within a month after maximum brightness. The velocity evolution of SN~2008aq matches well with those of other well-studied Type IIb SNe, while SN~2019gaf shows higher velocities. Close to maximum light, the H $α$ and He I line velocities of SN~2019gaf are $\sim$ 2000 km sec$^{-1}$ and $\sim$ 4000 km sec$^{-1}$ higher than other well-studied Type IIb SNe. Semi-analytical modeling indicates SN~2019gaf to be a more energetic explosion with a smaller ejecta mass than SN~2008aq. The zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of the progenitor estimated using the nebular spectra of SN~2008aq ranges between 13 to 20 M$\_\odot$, while for SN~2019gaf, the inferred ZAMS mass is between 13 to 25 M$\_\odot$. The [O I] to [Ca II] lines flux ratio favors a less massive progenitor star in a binary system for both the SNe.

2026-01-12, **Possible evidence for a pair-instability supernova nature of ultra-early JWST sources**, Andrea Ferrara et.al., [2601.07374v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07374v1)

 Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of unexpectedly bright sources at ultra-high redshift ($z > 15$), challenging current models of early galaxy formation. One extreme example is 'Capotauro', an F356W-dropout identified in the CEERS survey and initially interpreted as a luminous galaxy at $z\sim30$, but subsequently found to be variable over an $\sim 800$ day baseline. Motivated by this variability, we explore the alternative hypothesis that Capotauro is a pair-instability supernova (PISN) originating from a massive ($250-260\,M\_\odot$), metal-free star. Using state-of-the-art PISN light curves, spectral energy distributions, and synthetic spectra, we show that a PISN at $z\simeq 15$ can plausibly reproduce the observed brightness, temporal evolution, photometry, and NIRSpec spectrum. We compare this scenario with alternative interpretations, including a local Y0 brown dwarf, and discuss observational tests to discriminate among them. If confirmed, this event would provide a rare window onto Population III stars, and highlights the importance of transient contamination in ultra-high redshift galaxy samples.

2026-01-12, **Emulator-Based Inference of Cosmological Subgrid Models**, Nesar Ramachandra et.al., [2601.07306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07306v1)

 The formation of structure in the Universe at large scales is dominated by gravity, with baryonic physics becoming significant at $\sim{\rm Mpc}$ scales. To capture the impact of baryonic physics, cosmological simulations must model gas dynamics and a host of relevant astrophysical processes. A recent extension of the Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC) couples its gravity solver with a modern smoothed particle hydrodynamics method. This extension incorporates sub-resolution models for chemical enrichment, black hole and star formation, AGN kinetic and thermal feedback, supernova-driven feedback, galactic winds, and metal-line cooling. We present an inference framework based on high-fidelity emulators to aid in model calibration against observational targets, e.g., the galaxy stellar mass function, radial gas density profiles, and the cluster gas fraction. The emulators are trained on simulation suites comprising 64 boxes with side-length $128\,h^{-1}$Mpc and 16 boxes with side-length $256\,h^{-1}$Mpc with $2\times 512^3$ and $2\times 1024^3$ particles, respectively. Our analysis reveals two distinct AGN kinetic feedback modes -- a low-feedback mode yielding strong agreement with the observed radial gas density profiles of massive X-ray clusters, and a high-feedback mode providing a better fit to cluster gas fraction data, but systematically underestimating gas densities in inner regions.

 We present a radio analysis of the recently identified supernova remnant G321.3-3.9 using archival multi-wavelength data spanning 88-2304 MHz. The source exhibits an elliptical shell-like morphology (1.3 deg x 1.7 deg) and a relatively flat non-thermal spectral index of alpha = -0.40 +/- 0.03. The distance is estimated using both the Sigma-D relation (1.6-2.9 kpc) and tentative associations with HI structures, the latter suggesting a near-side solution of 2.5-3.3 kpc, though the physical connection remains uncertain.

 The astrophysical origins of the heaviest stable elements that we observe today in the Solar System are still not fully understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that H-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary sys- tem exploding as type Ia supernovae could be an efficient p-process source beyond iron. However, both observational evidence and stellar models challenge the required frequency of these events. In this work, we calculate the evolution and nucleosynthesis in slowly merging carbon-oxygen WDs. As our models approach the Chandrasekhar mass during the merger phase, the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg neutron source reaction is activated in the external layers of the primary WD, where the carbon-rich material accreted from the secondary WD is burned via the 12C+12C reaction, which provides the necessary α-particles via the 12C(12C,α)20Ne channel. The resulting neutron capture abundance distribution closely resembles a weak s-process one and peaks at Zr, which is overpro- duced by a factor of 30 compared to solar. The mass of the most external layers enriched in first-peak s-process elements crucially depends on the 12C+12C re- action rate, ranging between 0.05 Msun and ~0.1 Msun. These results indicate that slow white dwarf mergers can efficiently produce the lightest p-process iso- topes (such as 74Se, 78Kr, 84Sr, 92Mo and 94Mo) via γ-induced reactions if they explode via a delayed detonation mechanism, or eject the unburned external layers highly enriched in first peak s-process elements in the case of a pure deflagration. In both cases, we propose for the first time that slow WD mergers in binary systems may be a new relevant source for elements heavier than iron.

2026-01-11, **Viable f(R) Scenarios Unifying Inflation with Realistic Dynamical Dark Energy**, S. D. Odintsov et.al., [2601.06949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06949v1)

 Two $F(R)$ gravity models are tested on the basis of their viability during all stages of cosmological evolution. It is shown that these models can describe both the early-time inflationary epoch and the dark energy epoch. The models are confronted with the latest observational data, including the Pantheon+ catalogue with Type Ia supernovae, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, the Hubble parameter estimations and data from cosmic microwave background radiation. Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\frac{dF}{dR}>0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models. However the best fitted parameters, determined in confrontation with the mentioned observational data, lie far from the forbidden domains for both models. These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $Λ$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $χ^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. This success of the two $F(R)$ gravity scenarios is connected with their capability to mimic dynamical dark energy, similarly to models with variable equation of state, that is necessary for describing the latest Pantheon+ and DESI observational data.
