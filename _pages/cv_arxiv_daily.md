2023-03-15, **Trigger-Level Event Reconstruction for Neutrino Telescopes Using Sparse Submanifold Convolutional Neural Networks**, Felix J. Yu et.al., [2303.08812v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08812v1)

 Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have seen extensive applications in scientific data analysis, including in neutrino telescopes. However, the data from these experiments present numerous challenges to CNNs, such as non-regular geometry, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Consequently, CNNs are highly inefficient on neutrino telescope data, and require significant pre-processing that results in information loss. We propose sparse submanifold convolutions (SSCNNs) as a solution to these issues and show that the SSCNN event reconstruction performance is comparable to or better than traditional and machine learning algorithms. Additionally, our SSCNN runs approximately 16 times faster than a traditional CNN on a GPU. As a result of this speedup, it is expected to be capable of handling the trigger-level event rate of IceCube-scale neutrino telescopes. These networks could be used to improve the first estimation of the neutrino energy and direction to seed more advanced reconstructions, or to provide this information to an alert-sending system to quickly follow-up interesting events.

2023-03-15, **Discrimination of pp solar neutrinos and $^{14}$C pile-up events in a large scale LS detector**, Guo-Ming Chen et.al., [2303.08512v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08512v1)

 As an unique probe, the precision measurement of \textit{pp} neutrinos is important for the study of the Sun's energy mechanism, thermodynamic equilibrium monitoring, and neutrino oscillation in the vacuum dominated region. For a large scale liquid scintillator detector, one of the bottleneck for \textit{pp} neutrino detection comes from the pile-up events of intrinsic $^{14}$C decays. This paper presents a few approaches to discriminate \textit{pp} neutrinos and $^{14}$C pile-up events by considering the difference in their time and spatial distributions. In this work, a Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulation was built, then multivariate analysis and deep learning technology are adopted respectively to investigate the capability of $^{14}$C pile-up reduction. As a result, VGG network and BDTG model show good performance in the discrimination of \textit{pp} solar neutrinos and $^{14}$C double pile-up events, their signal significance can achieve 15.6 and 10.3 using only one day statistics. In this case, the signal efficiency is 42.7\% for the discrimination using VGG network when rejecting 99.81\% $^{14}$C double pile-up events. And the signal efficiency is 51.1\% for the case using BDTG model when rejecting 99.18\% $^{14}$C double pile-up events.

2023-03-15, **Performance of a spherical high pressure gas TPC for neutrino magnetic moment measurement**, R. Bouet et.al., [2303.08508v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08508v1)

 The measurement of neutrino magnetic moment larger than $10^{-19}\mu\_B$ would be a clear signature of physics beyond the standard model other than the existence of massive Dirac neutrinos. The use of a spherical proportional counter detector filled with gas at 40 bar located near a nuclear reactor would be a simple way to perform such a measurement exploiting the developments made on such a technology for the search of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay. Different targets can be used just by replacing the gas: xenon, CF$\_4$ and argon were compared and the sensitivity in one year of data taking could reach the level of $4.3 \times 10^{-12} \mu\_B$, $6.5 \times 10^{-12} \mu\_B$, and $8.5 \times 10^{-12} \mu\_B$, respectively.

2023-03-14, **Tau Polarization and Correlated Decays in Neutrino Experiments**, Joshua Isaacson et.al., [2303.08104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08104v1)

 We present the first fully differential predictions for tau neutrino scattering in the energy region relevant to the DUNE experiment, including all spin correlations and all tau lepton decay channels. The calculation is performed using a generic interface between the neutrino event generator Achilles and the publicly available, general-purpose collider event simulation framework Sherpa.

2023-03-14, **Primordial black hole formation during the QCD phase transition: threshold, mass distribution and abundance**, Ilia Musco et.al., [2303.07980v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07980v1)

 Primordial black hole (PBH) formation during cosmic phase transitions and annihilation periods, such as the QCD transition or the $e^+e^-$-annihilation, is known to be particularly efficient due to a softening of the equation of state. We present a detailed numerical study of PBH formation during the QCD epoch in order to derive an accurate PBH mass function. We also briefly consider PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch. Our investigation confirms that, for nearly scale-invariant spectra, PBH abundances on the QCD scale are enhanced by a factor $\sim 10^3$ compared to a purely radiation dominated Universe. For a power spectrum producing an (almost) scale-invariant PBH mass function outside of the transition, we find a peak mass of $M\_{\rm pbh}\approx 1.9 M\_{\odot}$ of which a fraction $f\approx 1.5\times 10^{-2}$ of the PBHs have a mass of $M\_{\rm pbh} > 10 M\_{\odot}$, possibly contributing to the LIGO-Virgo black hole merger detections. We point out that the physics of PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch is more complex as it is very close to the epoch of neutrino decoupling. We argue that neutrinos free-streaming out of overdense regions may actually hinder PBH formation.

2023-03-15, **Vorticity generation in cosmology and the role of shell crossing**, Obinna Umeh et.al., [2303.08782v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08782v1)

 There is no source for cosmic vorticity within the cold dark matter cosmology. However, vorticity has been observed in the universe, especially on the scales of clusters, filaments, galaxies, etc. Recent results from high-resolution general relativistic N-body simulation show that the vorticity power spectrum dominates over the power spectrum of the divergence of the peculiar velocity field on scales where the effective field theory of large-scale structure breaks down. Incidentally, this scale also corresponds to the scale where shell-crossing occurs. Several studies have suggested a link between shell crossing in the dark matter fluid and the vorticity generation in the universe, however, no clear proof of how it works exists yet. We describe for the first time how vorticity is generated in a universe such as ours with expanding and collapsing regions. We show how vorticity is generated at the boundary of the expanding and collapsing regions. Our result indicates that the amplitude of the generated vorticity is determined by the difference in gradients of the gravitational potential, pressure and the expansion rate of a one-parameter family of geodesics across the boundary. Additionally, we argue that the presence of vorticity in the matter fields implies a non-vanishing magnetic part of the Weyl tensor. This has implications for the generation of Maxwell's magnetic field and the dynamics of clusters. The impact on accelerated expansion of the universe and the existence of causal limit for massive particles are discussed

2023-03-15, **The halo model for cosmology: a pedagogical review**, Marika Asgari et.al., [2303.08752v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08752v1)

 We present a pedagogical review of the halo model, a flexible framework that can describe the distribution of matter and its tracers on non-linear scales for both conventional and exotic cosmological models. We start with the premise that the complex structure of the cosmic web can be described by the sum of its individual components: dark matter, gas, and galaxies, all distributed within spherical haloes with a range of masses. The halo properties are specified through a series of simulation-calibrated ingredients including the halo mass function, non-linear halo bias and a dark matter density profile that can additionally account for the impact of baryon feedback. By incorporating a model of the galaxy halo occupation distribution, the properties of central and satellite galaxies, their non-linear bias and intrinsic alignment can be predicted. Through analytical calculations of spherical collapse in exotic cosmologies, the halo model also provides predictions for non-linear clustering in beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models. The halo model has been widely used to model observations of a variety of large-scale structure probes, most notably as the primary technique to model the underlying non-linear matter power spectrum. By documenting these varied and often distinct use cases, we seek to further coherent halo model analyses of future multi-tracer observables. This review is accompanied by the release of pyhalomodel: https://github.com/alexander-mead/pyhalomodel , flexible software to conduct a wide range of halo-model calculations.

2023-03-15, **Superfluid dark matter in tension with weak gravitational lensing data**, Tobias Mistele et.al., [2303.08560v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08560v1)

 We investigate superfluid dark matter (SFDM), a model that promises to reproduce the successes of both particle dark matter on cosmological scales and those of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on galactic scales. But SFDM reproduces MOND only up to a certain distance from the galactic center and only for kinematic observables. Most importantly, it does not affect trajectories of light. We test whether or not this is in conflict with a recent analysis of weak gravitational lensing which has probed accelerations around galaxies at unprecedentedly large radii. This analysis found the data to be close to the prediction of MOND, suggesting they might be difficult to fit with SFDM. To investigate this matter, we solved the equations of motion of the model and compared the result to observational data. Our results show that the SFDM model is incompatible with the weak-lensing observations, at least in its current form.

2023-03-15, **The effect of non-equal emission times and space-time correlations on (anti-) nuclei production**, M. Kachelriess et.al., [2303.08437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08437v1)

 Light (anti-) nuclei are a powerful tool both in collider physics and astrophysics. In searches for new and exotic physics, the expected small astrophysical backgrounds at low energies make these antinuclei ideal probes for, e.g., dark matter. At the same time, their composite structure and small binding energies imply that they can be used in collider experiments to probe the hadronisation process and two-particle correlations. For the proper interpretation of such experimental studies, an improved theoretical understanding of (anti-) nuclei production in specific kinematic regions and detector setups is needed. In this work, we develop a coalescence framework for (anti-) deuteron production which accounts for both the emission volume and momentum correlations on an event-by-event basis. This framework goes beyond the equal-time approximation, which has been commonly assumed in femtoscopy experiments and (anti-) nucleus production models until now. Using PYTHIA~8 as an event generator, we find that the equal-time approximation leads to an error of O(10%) in low-energy processes like $\Upsilon$ decays, while the errors are negligible at LHC energies. The framework introduced in this work paves the way for tuning event generators to (anti-) nuclei measurements.

2023-03-15, **Constraints on axion-like polarization oscillations in the cosmic microwave background with POLARBEAR**, The POLARBEAR Collaboration et.al., [2303.08410v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08410v1)

 Very light pseudoscalar fields, often referred to as axions, are compelling dark matter candidates and can potentially be detected through their coupling to the electromagnetic field. Recently a novel detection technique using the cosmic microwave background (CMB) was proposed, which relies on the fact that the axion field oscillates at a frequency equal to its mass in appropriate units, leading to a time-dependent birefringence. For appropriate oscillation periods this allows the axion field at the telescope to be detected via the induced sinusoidal oscillation of the CMB linear polarization. We search for this effect in two years of POLARBEAR data. We do not detect a signal, and place a median $95 \%$ upper limit of $0.65 ^\circ$ on the sinusoid amplitude for oscillation frequencies between $0.02\,\text{days}^{-1}$ and $0.45\,\text{days}^{-1}$, which corresponds to axion masses between $9.6 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{eV}$ and $2.2\times 10^{-20} \,\text{eV}$. Under the assumptions that 1) the axion constitutes all the dark matter and 2) the axion field amplitude is a Rayleigh-distributed stochastic variable, this translates to a limit on the axion-photon coupling $g\_{\phi \gamma} < 2.4 \times 10^{-11} \,\text{GeV}^{-1} \times ({m\_\phi}/{10^{-21} \, \text{eV}})$.

2023-03-15, **Global fits of simplified models for dark matter with GAMBIT II. Vector dark matter with an $s$-channel vector mediator**, Christopher Chang et.al., [2303.08351v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08351v1)

 Global fits explore different parameter regions of a given model and apply constraints obtained at many energy scales. This makes it challenging to perform global fits of simplified models, which may not be valid at high energies. In this study, we derive a unitarity bound for a simplified vector dark matter model with an $s$-channel vector mediator, and apply it to global fits of this model with \GB in order to correctly interpret missing energy searches at the LHC. Two parameter space regions emerge as consistent with all experimental constraints, corresponding to different annihilation modes of the dark matter. We show that although these models are subject to strong validity constraints, they are currently most strongly constrained by measurements less sensitive to the high-energy behaviour of the theory. Understanding when these models cannot be consistently studied will become increasingly relevant as they are applied to LHC Run 3 data.

2023-03-14, **A Consistent View of Interacting Dark Energy from Multiple CMB Probes**, Yuejia Zhai et.al., [2303.08201v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08201v1)

 We analyze a cosmological model featuring an interaction between dark energy and dark matter in light of the measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background released by three independent experiments: the most recent data by the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and WMAP (9-year data). We show that different combinations of the datasets provide similar results, always favoring an interacting dark sector with a $95\%$~CL significance in the majority of the cases. Remarkably, such a preference remains consistent when cross-checked through independent probes, while always yielding a value of the expansion rate $H\_0$ consistent with the local distance ladder measurements. We investigate the source of this preference by scrutinizing the angular power spectra of temperature and polarization anisotropies as measured by different experiments.

2023-03-14, **Black holes surrounded by generic dark matter profiles: appearance and gravitational-wave emission**, Enzo Figueiredo et.al., [2303.08183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08183v1)

 We develop a numerical approach to find asymptotically flat black hole solutions coupled to anisotropic fluids, described by generic density profiles. Our model allows for a variety of applications in realistic astrophysical scenarios, and is potentially able to describe the geometry of galaxies hosting supermassive black holes, dark matter environments and accretion phenomena. We apply our framework to a black hole surrounded by different families of dark matter profiles, namely the Hernquist, the Navarro-Frenk White and the Einasto models. We study the geodesic motion of light and of massive particles in such spacetimes. Moreover we compute gravitational axial perturbations induced by a small secondary on the numerical background, and determine the changes in the emitted gravitational wave fluxes compared to the vacuum case. Our analysis confirms and extend previous studies showing that modifications of orbital frequencies and axial fluxes can be described in terms of gravitational-redshift, regardless of the halo model.

2023-03-14, **TRINITY II: The Luminosity-dependent Bias of the Supermassive Black Hole Mass--Galaxy Mass Relation for Bright Quasars at $z=6$**, Haowen Zhang et.al., [2303.08150v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08150v1)

 Using recent empirical constraints on the dark matter halo--galaxy--supermassive black hole (SMBH) connection from $z=0-7$, we infer how undermassive, typical, and overmassive SMBHs contribute to the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at $z=6$. We find that beyond $L\_\mathrm{bol} = 5 \times 10^{46}$ erg/s, the $z=6$ QLF is dominated by SMBHs that are at least 0.3 dex above the $z=6$ median $M\_\bullet-M\_*$ relation. The QLF is dominated by typical SMBHs (i.e., within $\pm 0.3$ dex around the $M\_\bullet-M\_*$ relation) at $L\_\mathrm{bol} \lesssim 10^{45}$ erg/s. At $z\sim 6$, the intrinsic $M\_\bullet-M\_*$ relation for all SMBHs is slightly steeper than the $z=0$ scaling, with a similar normalization at $M\_* \sim 10^{11} M\_\odot$. We also predict the $M\_\bullet-M\_*$ relation for $z=6$ bright quasars selected by different bolometric luminosity thresholds, finding very good agreement with observations. For quasars with $L\_\mathrm{bol} > 3 \times 10^{46}$ ($10^{48}$) erg/s, the scaling relation is shifted upwards by $\sim0.35$ (1.0) dex for $10^{11} M\_\odot$ galaxies. To accurately measure the intrinsic $M\_\bullet-M\_*$ relation, it is essential to include fainter quasars with $L\_\mathrm{bol} \lesssim 10^{45}$ erg/s. At high redshifts, low-luminosity quasars are thus the best targets for understanding typical formation paths for SMBHs in galaxies.

2023-03-14, **Measurement of the Compton scattering in germanium with a p-type point-contact germanium detector for dark matter detection**, J. W. Hu et.al., [2303.07978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07978v1)

 Low-energy background through Compton scattering from the ambient $\gamma$ rays can be contaminated in direct dark matter search experiments. In this paper, we report comparable measurements on low-energy spectra via Compton scattering from several $\gamma$-ray sources with a p-type point-contact germanium detector. The spectra between 500 eV and 18 keV have been measured and analyzed. Moreover, the features of the electron binding effect, particularly at the edges of the K- and L-shells in the germanium atom, were observed with different gamma sources and were consistent with the models in the Geant4 simulation. An empirical background model is proposed that provides insights into understanding the low-energy background in germanium for direct dark matter experiments.

2023-03-14, **Observational constraint on axion dark matter in the realistic halo profile with gravitational waves**, Takuya Tsutsui et.al., [2303.07688v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07688v1)

 Axions are considered as a candidate of dark matter. The axions form coherent clouds which delay and amplify gravitational waves (GWs) at a resonant frequency. That is, the coherent axion clouds produce secondary GWs following a primary wave. All GWs from compact binary mergers detected so far propagate in the Milky Way halo composed of dark matter so that such GWs are followed by the secondary GWs. Since the properties of the secondary GWs depend on the axion mass and coupling with the parity violating sector of gravity, we can search for a characteristic signal produced by axions. In our previous study, we have developed a search method optimized for the axion signals, and obtained about ten times stronger constraint on the coupling than the previous best one for the axion mass range, $[1.7 \times 10^{-13},\,8.5 \times 10^{-12}]\,\mathrm{eV}$. However, in our previous search, we assume that dark matter is homogeneously distributed in the Milky Way halo, which is unrealistic. In this paper, we extend the dark matter profile to a more realistic one called the core NFW profile, and find that the constraint in our previous study is robust to the dark matter profile.

2023-03-14, **Gravitational wave hints black hole remnants as dark matter**, Guillem Domènech et.al., [2303.07661v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07661v1)

 The end state of Hawking evaporation of a black hole is uncertain. Some candidate quantum gravity theories, such as loop quantum gravity and asymptotic safe gravity, hint towards Planck sized remnants. If so, the Universe might be filled with remnants of tiny primordial black holes, which formed with mass $M<10^9\,{\rm g}$. A unique scenario is the case of $M\sim 5\times10^5\,{\rm g}$, where tiny primordial black holes reheat the universe by Hawking evaporation and their remnants dominate the dark matter. Here, we point out that this scenario leads to a cosmological gravitational wave signal at frequencies $\sim 100{\rm Hz}$. Finding such a particular gravitational wave signature with, e.g. the Einstein Telescope, would suggest black hole remnants as dark matter.

2023-03-15, **Rapidly evolving Galactic plane outbursts in NEOWISE: Revisiting the Galactic nova rate with the first all-sky search in the mid-infrared**, Liam Zuckerman et.al., [2303.08795v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08795v1)

 The Galactic nova rate is intimately linked to our understanding of its chemical enrichment and progenitor channels of Type Ia supernovae. Yet past estimates have varied by more than an order of magnitude ($\approx10-300$ yr$^{-1}$) owing to limitations in both discovery methods as well as assumptions regarding the Galactic dust distribution and extragalactic stellar populations. Recent estimates utilizing synoptic near-infrared surveys have begun to provide a glimpse of a consensus ($\approx25-50$ yr$^{-1}$); however, a consistent estimate remains lacking. Here, we present the first all-sky search for Galactic novae using 8 years of data from the NEOWISE mid-infrared (MIR) survey. Operating at $3.4$ and $4.6$ $\mu$m where interstellar extinction is negligible, the 6-month cadence NEOWISE dataset offers unique sensitivity to discover slowly evolving novae across the entire Galaxy. Using a novel image subtraction pipeline together with systematic selection criteria, we identify a sample of 49 rapidly evolving MIR outbursts as candidate Galactic novae. While 27 of these sources are known novae, the remaining are previously missed nova candidates discovered in this work. The unknown events are spatially clustered along the densest and most heavily obscured regions of the Galaxy where previous novae are severely underrepresented. We use simulations of the NEOWISE survey strategy, the pipeline detection efficiency and our criteria to derive a Galactic nova rate of $47.9^{+3.1}\_{-8.3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The discovery of these exceptionally bright (yet overlooked) nova candidates confirm emerging suggestions that optical surveys have been highly incomplete in searches for Galactic novae, highlighting the potential for MIR searches in revealing the demographics of Galactic stellar outbursts.

2023-03-15, **Type Ia supernovae SN 2013bz, PSN J0910+5003 and ASASSN-16ex: similar to 09dc-like?**, S. Tiwari et.al., [2303.08422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08422v1)

 We present optical photometric and spectroscopic studies of three supernovae (SNe) SN 2013bz, PSN J0910+5003 and ASASSN-16ex. UV-optical photometric data of ASASSN-16ex obtained with Swift-UVOT are also analyzed. These objects were initially classified as 09dc-like type Ia SNe. The decline rate parameters ($\Delta m\_{15}(B)\_{true}$) are derived as 0.92 $\pm$ 0.04 (SN 2013bz), 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05 (PSN J0910+5003) and 0.73 $\pm$ 0.03 (ASASSN-16ex). The estimated $B$ band absolute magnitudes at maximum: $-$19.61 $\pm$ 0.20 mag for SN 2013bz, $-$19.44 $\pm$ 0.20 mag for PSN J0910+5003 and $-$19.78 $\pm$ 0.20 mag for ASASSN-16ex indicate that all the three objects are relatively bright. The peak bolometric luminosities for these objects are derived as $\log L\_\text{bol}^\text{max} =$ 43.38 $\pm$ 0.07 erg s$^{-1}$, 43.26 $\pm$ 0.07 erg s$^{-1}$ and 43.40 $\pm$ 0.06 erg s$^{-1}$, respectively. The spectral and velocity evolution of SN 2013bz is similar to a normal SN Ia, hence it appears to be a luminous, normal type Ia supernova. On the other hand, the light curves of PSN J0910+5003 and ASASSN-16ex are broad and exhibit properties similar to 09dc-like SNe Ia. Their spectroscopic evolution shows similarity with 09dc-like SNe, strong CII lines are seen in the pre-maximum spectra of these two events. Their photospheric velocity evolution is similar to SN 2006gz. Further, in the UV bands, ASASSN-16ex is very blue like other 09dc-like SNe Ia.

2023-03-14, **Thermal effects in hot and dilute homogeneous asymmetric nuclear matter**, Vishal Parmar et.al., [2303.07974v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07974v1)

 We present a comprehensive analysis of hot and dilute isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter employing the temperature-dependent effective-relativistic mean-field theory (E-RMF). The E-RMF is applied to study the effect of $\delta$ and $\omega-\rho$ meson cross-coupling on the thermal properties of asymmetric nuclear matter using two recently developed IOPB-I and G3 parameter sets. These sets are known to reproduce the nuclear matter properties in agreement with various experimental and observational constraints. We consider the nuclear matter to be homogeneous and study the equation of state (EoS) for densities, temperature and asymmetry which are relevant for astrophysical simulations such as supernovae explosion. The effect of temperature is investigated in reference to the density-dependent free symmetry energy and its higher-order derivatives using the well known parabolic approximation. The larger value of $\lambda\_\omega$ cross-coupling in G3 in addition to the $\delta$ meson coupling in G3 smoothen the free symmetry energy. Thermal effects on various state variables are examined at fixed temperature and isospin asymmetry by separating their T=0 and the finite-T expressions. The thermal effects are mainly governed by effective mass with larger effective mass estimating larger thermal contribution. The effect of temperature on isothermal and isentropic incompressibility is discussed which is in harmony with various available microscopic calculations. The liquid-gas phase transition properties are examined in asymmetric matter with two conserved charges in the context of different slope parameter and comparable symmetry energy in IOPB-I and G3 set. The spinodal instability, binodal curve and critical properties are found to be influenced by the slope parameter $L\_{sym}$.

2023-03-14, **Photometry and spectroscopy of the Type Icn supernova 2021ckj: The diverse properties of the ejecta and circumstellar matter of Type Icn SNe**, T. Nagao et.al., [2303.07721v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07721v1)

 We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Icn supernova (SN) 2021ckj. Spectral modeling of SN 2021ckj reveals that its composition is dominated by oxygen, carbon and iron group elements, and the photospheric velocity at peak is ~10000 km/s. From the light curve (LC) modeling applied to SNe 2021ckj, 2019hgp, and 2021csp, we find that the ejecta and CSM properties of Type Icn SNe are diverse. SNe 2021ckj and 2021csp likely have two ejecta components (an aspherical high-energy component and a spherical standard-energy component) with a roughly spherical CSM, while SN 2019hgp can be explained by a spherical ejecta-CSM interaction alone. The ejecta of SNe 2021ckj and 2021csp have larger energy per ejecta mass than the ejecta of SN 2019hgp. The density distribution of the CSM is similar in these three SNe, and is comparable to those of Type Ibn SNe. This may imply that the mass-loss mechanism is common between Type Icn (and also Type Ibn) SNe. The CSM masses of SN 2021ckj and SN 2021csp are higher than that of SN 2019hgp, although all these values are within the diversity seen in Type Ibn SNe. The early spectrum of SN 2021ckj shows narrow emission lines from C II and C III, without a clear absorption component, in contrast with that observed in SN 2021csp. The similarity of the emission components of these lines implies that the emitting regions of SNe 2021ckj and 2021csp have similar ionization states, and thus suggests that they have similar properties of the ejecta and CSM, which is inferred also from the LC modeling. Taking into account the difference in the strength of the absorption features, this heterogeneity may be attributed to viewing angle effects in otherwise common aspherical ejecta.
