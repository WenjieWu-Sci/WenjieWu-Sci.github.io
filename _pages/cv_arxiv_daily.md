2023-05-02, **Extended Analysis of Neutrino-Dark Matter Interactions with Small-Scale CMB Experiments**, Philippe Brax et.al., [2305.01383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01383v1)

 We explore an extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by including an interaction between neutrinos and dark matter, and making use of the ground based telescope data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). An indication for a non-zero coupling between dark matter and neutrinos (both assuming a temperature independent and $T^2$ dependent cross-section) is obtained at the 1$\sigma$ level coming from the ACT CMB data alone and when combined with the Planck CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. This result is confirmed by both fixing the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe to the Standard Model value of $N\_{\rm eff}=3.044$, and allowing $N\_{\rm eff}$ to be a free cosmological parameter. Furthermore, when performing a Bayesian model comparison, the interacting $\nu$DM (+$N\_{\rm eff}$) scenario is mostly preferred over a baseline $\Lambda$CDM (+$N\_{\rm eff}$) cosmology. The preferred value is then used as a benchmark and the potential implications of dark matter's interaction with a sterile neutrino are discussed.

2023-05-02, **Quantum information and quantum simulation of neutrino physics**, A. B. Balantekin et.al., [2305.01150v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01150v1)

 In extreme astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play a major role in driving various dynamical and microphysical phenomena, such as baryonic matter outflows, the synthesis of heavy elements, and the supernova explosion mechanism itself. The interactions of neutrinos with matter in these environments are flavor-specific, which makes it of paramount importance to understand the flavor evolution of neutrinos. Flavor evolution in these environments can be a highly nontrivial problem thanks to a multitude of collective effects in flavor space, arising due to neutrino-neutrino ($\nu$-$\nu$) interactions in regions with high neutrino densities. A neutrino ensemble undergoing flavor oscillations under the influence of significant $\nu$-$\nu$ interactions is somewhat analogous to a system of coupled spins with long-range interactions among themselves and with an external field ('long-range' in momentum-space in the case of neutrinos). As a result, it becomes pertinent to consider whether these interactions can give rise to significant quantum correlations among the interacting neutrinos, and whether these correlations have any consequences for the flavor evolution of the ensemble. In particular, one may seek to utilize concepts and tools from quantum information science and quantum computing to deepen our understanding of these phenomena. In this article, we attempt to summarize recent work in this field. Furthermore, we also present some new results in a three-flavor setting, considering complex initial states.

2023-05-01, **Phenomenology of the simplest linear seesaw mechanism**, Aditya Batra et.al., [2305.00994v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00994v1)

 The linear seesaw mechanism provides a simple way to generate neutrino masses. In addition to Standard Model particles, it includes quasi-Dirac leptons as neutrino mass mediators, and a leptophilic scalar doublet seeding small neutrino masses. Here we review its associated physics, including restrictions from theory and phenomenology. The model yields potentially detectable $\mu\to e\gamma$ rates as well as distinctive signatures in the production and decay of heavy neutrinos ($N\_i$) and the charged Higgs boson ($H^\pm$) arising from the second scalar doublet. We have found that production processes such as $e^+e^-\to NN$, $e^-\gamma\to NH^-$ and $e^+ e^-\to H^+ H^-$ followed by the decay chain $H^\pm\to\ell\_i^\pm N$, $N\to \ell\_j^{\pm}W^\mp$ leads to striking lepton number violation signatures at high energies which may probe the Majorana nature of neutrinos.

2023-05-01, **Searching for $^{76}$Ge neutrinoless double beta decay with the CDEX-1B experiment**, B. T. Zhang et.al., [2305.00894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00894v1)

 We operated a p-type point contact high purity germanium (PPCGe) detector (CDEX-1B, 1.008 kg) in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL) for 500.3 days to search for neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of $^{76}$Ge. A total of 504.3 kg $\cdot$ day effective exposure data was accumulated. The anti-coincidence and the multi/single-site event (MSE/SSE) discrimination methods were used to suppress the background in the energy region of interest (ROI, $1989-2089$ keV for this work) with a factor of 23. A background level of 0.33 counts/(keV $\cdot$ kg $\cdot$ yr) was achieved. The lower limit on the half life of $^{76}$Ge $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay was constrained as $T\_{1/2}^{0\nu}\ > \ {2.2}\times 10^{23}\ \rm yr\ (90\% \ C.L.)$, corresponding to the upper limits on the effective Majorana neutrino mass: $\langle m\_{\beta\beta}\rangle < 2.3-5.2\ \mathrm{eV}$.

2023-05-01, **Impact of isovector pairing fluctuation on neutrinoless double-beta decay in multi-reference covariant density functional theory**, C. R. Ding et.al., [2305.00742v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00742v2)

 We extend a multi-reference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT) by including fluctuations in quadrupole shapes and isovector pairing amplitudes simultaneously for the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of neutrinoless double-beta $(0\nu\beta\beta)$ decay in the candidate nuclei $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{100}$Mo, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe assuming the mechanism of exchanging either light or heavy neutrinos. The results show that including isovector pairing fluctuations can increase the excitation energies of low-lying states by 10% to 50%, and enhance the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay by about 40%-80%. This enhancement is systematically larger than that found in the previous non-relativistic calculation based on the Gogny force. Besides, we find that the NMEs are linearly correlated with the excitation energies of low-lying states while varying the isovector pairing strengths. This correlation could be utilized to constrain the NMEs while performing a statistical analysis of uncertainty arising from the pairing strengths between nucleons.

2023-05-02, **A proof of slow-roll local decay of inflaton fields in cosmology and axion fields in cold dark matter models**, MatÃ­as Morales et.al., [2305.01495v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01495v1)

 We consider the long time behavior of solutions to scalar field models appearing in the theory of cosmological inflation (oscillons) and cold dark matter, in presence or absence of the cosmological constant. These models are not included in standard mathematical literature due to their unusual nonlinearities, which model different features to classical ones. Here we prove that these models fit in the theory of dispersive decay by computing new virials adapted to their setting. Several important examples, candidates to model both effects are studied in detail.

2023-05-02, **Primordial black holes formation in a early matter dominated era from the pre-big bang scenario**, Conzinu P. et.al., [2305.01430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01430v1)

 We discuss the production of primordial black holes in an early matter dominated era, which typically takes place in string inspired early universe cosmological models. In particular, we consider a pre-big bang scenario (extending previous results regarding formation in the radiation dominated era) where the enhancement of curvature perturbations is induced by a variation of the sound-speed parameter c\_s during the string phase of high-curvature inflation. After imposing all relevant observational constraints, we find that the considered class of models is compatible with the production of a large amount of primordial black holes, in the mass range relevant to dark matter, only for a small range of the parameters space. On the other hand, we find that a huge production of light primordial black holes may occur both in such matter dominated era and in the radiation dominated one.

2023-05-02, **On 1 + 3 covariant perturbations of the quasi-Newtonian space-time in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity**, Albert Munyeshyaka et.al., [2305.01331v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01331v1)

 The consideration of a 1 + 3 covariant approach to cold dark matter universe with no shear cosmological dust model with irrotational flows is developed in the context of f (G) gravity theory in the present study. This approach reveals the existence of integrability conditions which do not appear in non-covariant treatments. We constructed the integrability conditions in modified Gauss-Bonnet f (G) gravity basing on the constraints and propagation equations. These integrability conditions reveal the linearized silent nature of quasi-Newtonian models in f (G) gravity. Finally, the linear equations for the overdensity and velocity perturbations of the quasi-Newtonian space-time were constructed in the context of modified f (G) gravity. The application of harmonic decomposition and redshift transformation techniques to explore the behaviour of the overdensity and velocity perturbations using f (G) model were made. On the other hand we applied the quasi-static approximation to study the approximated solutions on small scales which helps to get both analytical and numerical results of the perturbation equations. The analysis of the energy overdensity and velocity perturbations for both short and long wavelength modes in a dust-Gauss-Bonnet fluids were done and we see that both energy overdensity and velocity perturbations decay with redshift for both modes. In the limits to {\Lambda}CDM , it means f (G) = G the considered f (G) model results coincide with {\Lambda}CDM .

2023-05-02, **Impact of astrophysical effects on the dark matter mass constraint with 21cm intensity mapping**, Koya Murakami et.al., [2305.01256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01256v1)

 We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold dark matter model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying dark matter particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the dark matter distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the dark matter model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the dark matter constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.

2023-05-02, **Influence of the deviation of the matter power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal at cosmic dawn**, Yupeng Yang et.al., [2305.01149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01149v1)

 The matter power spectrum has been strongly constrained by astronomical measurements at large scales, but only weakly at small scales. Compared with the standard scenario, the deviation of the matter power spectrum at small scales has influence on the cosmological structure formation, e.g., the comoving number density of dark matter halos. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can be changed if dark matter is made of weakly interacting massive particles and can annihilate into standard model particles. The changes of the evolution of IGM could leave imprints on the relevant astronomical observations. Taking into account the dark matter annihilation, we investigate the impact of the deviation of matter power spectrum at small scales on the global 21-cm signal. In view of the measurements of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES experiment, we explore the allowed parameter space of $m\_s$, which describes the degree of deviation, by requiring the differential brightness temperature of the global 21-cm signal $\delta T\_{21} \le -50~\rm mK$ at redshift $z=17$.

2023-05-02, **Bayesian analysis for rotational curves with $\ell$-boson stars as a dark matter component**, Atalia Navarro-Boullosa et.al., [2305.01127v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01127v1)

 Using Low Brightness Surface Galaxies (LBSG) rotational curves we inferred the free parameters of $\ell$-boson stars as a dark matter component. The $\ell$-boson stars are numerical solutions to the non-relativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, the Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) system. These solutions are parametrized by an angular momentum number $\ell = (N-1)/2$ and an excitation number $n$. We perform a bayesian analysis by modifying the SimpleMC code to perform the parameter inference, for the cases with $\ell = 0$, $\ell = 1$ and multistates of $\ell$-boson stars. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion and the Bayes factor to compare the excited state ($\ell$=1) and the multistate case with the ground state ($\ell$=0) as the base model due to its simplicity. We found that the data in most galaxies in the sample favours the multistates case and that the scalar field mass tends to be slightly bigger than the ground state case.

2023-05-01, **Lights in the Dark: Globular clusters as dark matter tracers**, Lucas M. Valenzuela et.al., [2305.01007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01007v1)

 A long-standing observed curiosity of globular clusters (GCs) has been that both the number and total mass of GCs in a galaxy are linearly correlated with the galaxy's virial mass, whereas its stellar component shows no such linear correlation. This work expands on an empirical model for the numbers and ages of GCs in galaxies presented by Valenzuela et al. (2021) that is consistent with recent observational data from massive elliptical galaxies down to the dwarf galaxy regime. Applying the model to simulations, GC numbers are shown to be excellent tracers for the dark matter (DM) virial mass, even when distinct formation mechanisms are employed for blue and red GCs. Furthermore, the amount of DM smooth accretion is encoded in the GC abundances, therefore providing a measure for an otherwise nearly untraceable component of the formation history of galaxies.

2023-05-01, **Self-similar growth of Bose stars**, A. S. Dmitriev et.al., [2305.01005v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01005v1)

 We analytically solve the problem of Bose star growth in the bath of gravitationally interacting particles. We find that after nucleation of this object, the bath is described by a self-similar solution of the kinetic equation, which is an attractor. Together with the conservation laws, this fixes mass evolution of the Bose star. Our results explain slowdown of the star growth at a certain "core-halo" mass, but also predict formation of the heavier and lighter objects in magistral dark matter models.

2023-05-01, **Haunted haloes: tracking the ghosts of subhaloes lost by halo finders**, Benedikt Diemer et.al., [2305.00993v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00993v1)

 Dark matter subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes stripped matter. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure. Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are publicly available.

2023-05-01, **Search for dark photons with synchronized quantum sensor network**, Min Jiang et.al., [2305.00890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00890v1)

 Ultralight dark photons constitute a well-motivated candidate for dark matter. Nevertheless, current constraints on the existence of dark photons with masses below MHz are predominantly set by cosmological or astrophysical limits. They behave as effective currents when coupled with standard model photons through kinetic mixing. When situated in electromagnetic shielded rooms, oscillating magnetic fields are generated with the maximum field strength proportional to the shield size. Here, we demonstrate a network of 15 atomic magnetometers, which are synchronized with the Global Positioning System (GPS) and are situated on the edges of two meter-scale shielded rooms, serving as a powerful tool to search for dark photons. Both the network multiple quantum sensors and the shield large size significantly enhance the expected dark-photon signals. Using this network, we constrain the kinetic mixing coefficient of dark photon dark matter over the mass range 1-500 Hz, which gives the strongest constraint of a terrestrial experiment within this mass window. Our prospect indicates that future data releases may go beyond the constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background and the gas cloud cooling.

2023-05-01, **Recent Results from BABAR: Dark Matter, Axion-like Particles and Heavy Neutral Leptons, a contribution to the 2023 Electroweak session of the 57th Rencontres de Moriond**, Sophie Middleton et.al., [2305.00808v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00808v1)

 Three independent searches for new physics using data collected at BABAR are presented. Firstly, two searches for dark matter and baryogenesis: $B^{0}\rightarrow \Lambda + \psi\_{D}$ and $B^{+} \rightarrow p + \psi\_{D}$ are detailed, where $\psi\_{D}$ is a new dark fermion. Neither signal is observed and new upper limits on the branching fractions, at the 90 $\%$ confidence level (C.L), are placed at $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5} - 10^{-6})$ across the mass range $1.0< m\_{\psi\_{D}}<4.3$ GeV/c$^{2}$. Secondly, new limits on the coupling, $g\_{aW}$, of an axion-like particle ($a$) to the $W$ boson, at the 90 $\%$ C.L, are presented at $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $a$ masses in the mass range 0.175 $<m\_{a}<$ 4.78 GeV/c$^{2}$. Thirdly, a model-independent search for heavy neutral leptons (HNL) found new upper limits at the 95 $\%$ C.L on the extended Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix element, $\|U\_{\tau 4}\|^{2}$, which depend on the HNL mass hypothesis and vary from $2.31 \times 10^{-2}$ to $5.04 \times 10^{-6}$, across the mass range $100 < m\_{4} < 1300$ MeV/c$^{2}$, with more stringent limits on higher HNL masses.

2023-05-01, **Invisible Decays of a Non-SM-like $H_2$ to Dark Matter in the N2HDM and the NMSSM**, Maien Binjonaid et.al., [2305.00779v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00779v1)

 We investigate two extensions of the standard model that include particle dark matter candidates: the N2HDM and the NMSSM. These models feature a non-SM-like CP-even scalar with a sub-TeV mass, denoted by $H\_2$, among other particles. At a 13 TeV proton-proton collider, the primary production channel for such scalars is via the fusion of a pair of gluons. Subsequently, these scalars can decay invisibly into a pair of dark matter candidates, with some regions of the parameter space exhibiting a dominance of such decay over other modes. In the supersymmetric model, it is possible for the LSP and NLSP to be mass degenerate, leading to quasi-invisible $H\_2$ decays to LSP+NLSP and NLSP+NLSP. We present the predictions of both models for this challenging scenario while ensuring compatibility with recent experimental constraints.

2023-05-02, **Cosmic acceleration in entropic cosmology**, Javier Chagoya et.al., [2305.01607v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01607v1)

 In this paper we study the viability of an entropic cosmological model. The effects of entropic gravity are derived from a modified entropy-area relationship with a volumetric entropy term. This model describes a late time limit {cosmic acceleration}, whose origin is related to a volumetric term in the entropy. Moreover, we analyze the phenomenological implications of the entropic model using the Supernovae {\it Pantheon} compilation and the observational Hubble parameter data to find consistency with cosmological observations. Finally, we show the equivalence between the entropic model and a brane world cosmological model, by means of an effective geometrical construction.
