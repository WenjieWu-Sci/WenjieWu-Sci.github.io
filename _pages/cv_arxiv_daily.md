2025-02-06, **Radon Removal in XENONnT down to the Solar Neutrino Level**, E. Aprile et.al., [2502.04209v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04209v1)

 The XENONnT experiment has achieved an unprecedented reduction of the $^\text{222}$Rn activity concentration within its liquid xenon dual-phase time projection chamber to a level of (0.90$\,\pm\,$0.01$\,$stat.$\,\pm\,$0.07 sys.)$\,\mu$Bq/kg, equivalent to about 1200 $^\text{222}$Rn atoms per cubic meter of liquid xenon. This represents a 15-fold improvement over the $^\text{222}$Rn levels encountered during XENON1T's main science runs and is a factor five lower compared to other currently operational multi-tonne liquid xenon detectors engaged in dark matter searches. This breakthrough enables the pursuit of various rare event searches that lie beyond the confines of the standard model of particle physics, with world-leading sensitivity. The ultra-low $^\text{222}$Rn levels have diminished the radon-induced background rate in the detector to a point where it is for the first time lower than the solar neutrino-induced background, which is poised to become the primary irreducible background in liquid xenon-based detectors.

2025-02-06, **Can a secluded self-interacting dark sector generate detectable gravitational waves?**, Song Li et.al., [2502.04108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04108v1)

 In this work we study the possibility to detect the gravitational waves generated by a secluded self-interacting dark sector. ``Secluded'' means that the dark sector has almost no portal to the visible sector and thus its entropy is conserved by itself, and ``self-interacting'' means that dark matter in this model has a significant interaction to itself, making it consistent with the small-scale structure observations. A spontaneously broken $U(1)'$ is introduced for the interactions in the dark sector, and nearly massless dark radiation is also introduced to avoid the over-closure problem. Through a parameter space scan, we find that this model is highly constrained by the current observed effective number of neutrinos ($N\_{\text{eff}}$) and the large-scale structure observable Lyman-$\alpha$. Combined together, these two constraints make such a secluded self-interacting dark sector almost impossible to generate gravitational waves accessible at future projects like SKA or LISA.

2025-02-06, **VERITAS and multiwavelength observations of the Blazar B3 2247+381 in response to an IceCube neutrino alert**, Atreya Acharyya et.al., [2502.03853v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03853v1)

 While the sources of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory are still largely unknown, one of the promising methods used towards understanding this is investigating the potential temporal and spatial correlations between neutrino alerts and the electromagnetic radiation from blazars. We report on the multiwavelength target-of-opportunity observations of the blazar B3 2247+381, taken in response to an IceCube multiplet alert for a cluster of muon neutrino events compatible with the source location between May 20, 2022 and November 10, 2022. B3 2247+381 was not detected with VERITAS during this time period. The source was found to be in a low-flux state in the optical, ultraviolet and gamma-ray bands for the time interval corresponding to the neutrino event, but was detected in the hard X-ray band with NuSTAR during this period. We find the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution is well described using a simple one-zone leptonic synchrotron self-Compton radiation model. Moreover, assuming the neutrinos originate from hadronic processes within the jet, the neutrino flux would be accompanied by a photon flux from the cascade emission, and the integrated photon flux required in such a case would significantly exceed the total multiwavelength fluxes and the VERITAS upper limits presented here. The lack of flaring activity observed with VERITAS, combined with the low multiwavelength flux levels, and given the significance of the neutrino excess is at 3$\sigma$ level (uncorrected for trials), makes B3 2247+381 an unlikely source of the IceCube multiplet. We conclude that the neutrino excess is likely a background fluctuation.

2025-02-06, **Fermion Dark Matter Effect on Electroweak Phase Transition**, Soudeh Mirzaie et.al., [2502.04265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04265v1)

 The addition of extra scalars to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics enriches the vacuum structure and consequently gives rise to strong first-order phase transitions (EWPT) in the early universe. We raise the question that how the EWPT is affected by the addition of fermions in models beyond the SM, and address this question by studying the EWPT in a dark matter model comprising a singlet scalar and two Dirac fermions. The singlet scalar develops a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV), and the lighter fermion plays the role of the dark matter. The model evades the stringent direct detection bounds due to the presence of two fermions. We first show that applying the high-temperature approximation, no first-order phase transition is found. Then we demonstrate that when including the full finite temperature corrections to the effective potential, the first-order phase transition becomes possible, nevertheless, all the phase transitions will be weak. We therefore deduce that the addition of fermions reduces the strength of the EWPT.

2025-02-06, **Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars -- II**, Swarnim Shirke et.al., [2502.04068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04068v1)

 Boson Stars (BSs) are macroscopic self-gravitating configurations made of complex scalar fields. These exotic compact objects (ECO) would manifest as dark Boson stars and can contribute to a certain fraction of the dark matter (DM) in the universe. In this work, we study the fundamental non-radial oscillations ($f$-modes) of massive BSs and the associated gravitational wave (GW) emission. We consider massive scalar BSs having the potential of the form $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2\|\phi\|^2 + \frac{1}{4}\lambda \|\phi\|^4$, restricting to the strong-coupling regime ($\lambda \gg m^2/M\_{Pl}^2$) where solutions resembling fermionic stars are known to exist. We first review the available parameter space for scalar DM that can form massive BSs and enlist various constraints. We fit and provide simple analytical relations connecting various macroscopic observables for BSs, which can be directly incorporated into future studies of massive BSs throughout the strong coupling regime without requiring any numerical computation. We then solve for the non-radial $l=2$ fundamental quasinormal modes ($f$-modes) for massive BSs. Scaling relations for $f$-mode equations have been reported in another work. Using these, we perform a complete study of these oscillations spanning the entire available parameter space of massive BSs and provide analytical fits for the $f$-mode characteristics. We further study the universal relations for BSs and reveal the parameter space that is sensitive to the current and future planned GW detectors. We find that different parts of the parameters space can, in principle, be probed by the LISA, LIGO, and NEMO detectors. Finally, we briefly discuss the detectability of $f$-modes from BSs that have not been explored before.

2025-02-06, **Proof of principle for a light dark matter search with low-energy positron beams at NA64**, Yu. M. Andreev et.al., [2502.04053v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04053v1)

 Thermal light dark matter (LDM) with particle masses in the 1 MeV - 1 GeV range could successfully explain the observed dark matter abundance as a relic from the primordial Universe. In this picture, a new feeble interaction acts as a "portal" between the Standard Model and LDM particles, allowing for the exploration of this paradigm at accelerator experiments. In the last years, the "missing energy" experiment NA64e at CERN SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron) has set world-leading constraints in the vector-mediated LDM parameter space, by exploiting a 100 GeV electron beam impinging on an electromagnetic calorimeter, acting as an active target. In this paper, we report a detailed description of the analysis of a preliminary measurement with a 70 GeV positron beam at NA64e, performed during summer 2023 with an accumulated statistic of 1.6 x 10^10 positrons on target. This data set was analyzed with the primary aim of evaluating the performance of the NA64e detector with a lower energy positron beam, towards the realization of the post-LS3 program. The analysis results, other than additionally probing unexplored regions in the LDM parameter space, provide valuable information towards the future NA64e positron campaign.

2025-02-06, **Gaps in stellar streams as a result of globular cluster fly-bys**, Salvatore Ferrone et.al., [2502.03941v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03941v1)

 Thin stellar streams, such as those resulting from the tidal disruption of globular clusters, have long been known and used as probes of the gravitational potential of our Galaxy, both its visible and dark contents. In particular, the presence of under-density regions, or gaps, along these streams is commonly interpreted as being due to the close passage of dark matter sub-halos. In this work, we investigate the perturbations induced on streams by the passage of dense stellar systems, such as globular clusters themselves, to test the possibility that they may cause the formation of gaps as well. In particular, we focus on the study of the stream of Palomar 5, a well-known globular cluster in the Galactic halo, which has particularly long tidal tails. For this purpose, we used a particle-test code to simulate Palomar 5's tidal tails when subjected to the Galaxy's gravitational field plus its whole system of globular clusters. Our study shows that the tails of Palomar 5 can be strongly perturbed by the close passage of other clusters, in particular of NGC 2808, NGC 7078, NGC 104, and that these perturbations induce the formation of gaps in the tails. These results show that globular clusters are capable of inducing gaps in streams--as other baryonic components such as giant molecular clouds and the galactic bar have been shown to do in other works. Therefore, when searching to construct the distribution function of dark matter sub halos within the Milky Way, the gap contribution from globular clusters must be included.

2025-02-06, **On the relationship between the cosmic web and the alignment of galaxies and AGN jets**, Seoyoung Lyla Jung et.al., [2502.03730v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03730v1)

 The impact of active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the evolution of galaxies explains the steep decrease in the number density of the most massive galaxies in the Universe. However, the fueling of the AGN and the efficiency of this feedback largely depend on their environment. We use data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS DR2), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR12 to make the first study of the orientations of radio jets and their optical counterpart in relation to the cosmic web environment. We find that close to filaments ($\lesssim 11 \,\rm Mpc$), galaxies tend to have their optical major axes aligned with the nearest filaments. On the other hand, radio jets, which are generally aligned perpendicularly to the optical major axis of the host galaxy, show more randomised orientations with respect to host galaxies within $\lesssim 8 \,\rm Mpc$ of filaments. These results support the scenario that massive galaxies in cosmic filaments grow by numerous mergers directed along the orientation of the filaments while experiencing chaotic accretion of gas onto the central black hole. The AGN-driven jets consequently have a strong impact preferentially along the minor axes of dark matter halos within filaments. We discuss the implications of these results for large-scale radio jet alignments, intrinsic alignments between galaxies, and the azimuthal anisotropy of the distribution of circumgalactic medium and anisotropic quenching.

2025-02-06, **The DESI 2024 hint for dynamical dark energy is biased by low-redshift supernovae**, Lu Huang et.al., [2502.04212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04212v1)

 Recently, a $\sim3.9\sigma$ preference for dynamical dark energy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration inspired hot debates on new physics or systematics. In this letter, we reveal this significant preference is dominated by an external low-redshift supernova (low-$z$ SN) sample that combines with the Dark Energy Survey SN program (DES-SN) in their Year 5 data release (DESY5). Further implementing the $a\_B$ (the intercept of the SN magnitude-redshift relation) diagnosis between low-$z$ and DES-SN samples, we find large dispersions in the low-$z$ SN sample with a $\sim0.043$ magnitude discrepancy in $-5a\_B$ from the high-$z$ DES-SN sample, suggesting potential systematics in DESY5. Correcting for this low-$z$ systematics or directly ignoring the low-$z$ sample can largely reduce the preference for dynamical DE to be $<2\sigma$. Therefore, the DESI preference for dynamical DE might be a mirage of low-$z$ SN systematics with a mismatch intercept. Our additional test demonstrates the currently available data cannot provide decisive evidence for dynamical DE.

2025-02-06, **The GeV $γ$-ray emission from the composite SNR CTB 87**, Yuliang Xin et.al., [2502.03794v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03794v1)

 We report the GeV $\gamma$-ray emission around the composite supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 87 with more than 16 yrs PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Two separate point sources with the different GeV spectra are identified in this region: one has a soft $\gamma$-ray spectrum, likely due to interactions between the SNR shock and molecular clouds (MCs); and another source with a hard GeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum aligns with the TeV spectrum of VER J2016+371, suggesting it as the GeV counterpart. Considering the observations of CTB 87 in the radio and X-ray bands, VER J2016+371 is proposed to originate from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR J2016+3711. A leptonic model with a broken power-law electron distribution could explain the multi-wavelength data of VER J2016+371, with fitted parameters matching typical $\gamma$-ray PWNe. Deeper searching for the SNR shock of CTB 87 in other bands and the future TeV observations by LHAASO and CTA are crucial to reveal the nature of CTB 87.

2025-02-06, **Dependence of Multi-band Absolute Magnitudes and Color Indexes of the Tip of Red Giant Branch Stars on Metallicity in the Galactic Globular Clusters**, Zhenzhen Shao et.al., [2502.03705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03705v1)

 The tip of red giant branch (TRGB) stars have attracted intensive attention in recent years because their $I$-band absolute magnitudes, $M\_\rm I$, are often used for distance calibration in the Hubble constant measurements because of its almost independence on metallicity ([Fe/H]). However, a discrepancy exists between various studies and the theoretical stellar model predicts dependence of their luminosity on [Fe/H]. Here we present a careful study of the dependence of absolute magnitudes and color indexes on metallicity in optical and near-infrared bands. With the TRGB stars identified in 33 Galactic globular clusters by the reddest color in the $G\_{\rm BP}-G\_{\rm RP}$ vs. $G\_{\rm RP}$ diagram, it is confirmed that $M\_\rm I$ is almost constant of $-4.017 \pm 0.036 \pm 0.027$ mag when $[\rm Fe/H]<-1.2$, which would give $H\_0=70.86\pm 1.2\pm0.9$ $\rm kms^{-1} Mp c^{-1}$ with this updated luminosity calibration for type Ia supernovae. However, for $[\rm Fe/H]>-1.2$, $M\_\rm I$ is found to become fainter with lower metallicity, which would lead to a larger Hubble constant. In the optical $G\_{\rm BP}, G\_{\rm RP}$ and $V$ bands, the absolute magnitude of TRGB stars tends to increase with metallicity, while in the infrared $J, H$, and $K\_{\rm S}$ bands, the variation with metallicity shows an inverse tendency. In addition, the analytical relations of the color indexes with metallicity are presented, which have smaller dispersion than those derived for the corresponding absolute magnitudes.
