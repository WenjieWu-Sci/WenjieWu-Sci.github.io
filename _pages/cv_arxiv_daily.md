2023-07-05, **$Î½^2$-Flows: Fast and improved neutrino reconstruction in multi-neutrino final states with conditional normalizing flows**, John Andrew Raine et.al., [2307.02405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02405v1)

 In this work we introduce $\nu^2$-Flows, an extension of the $\nu$-Flows method to final states containing multiple neutrinos. The architecture can natively scale for all combinations of object types and multiplicities in the final state for any desired neutrino multiplicities. In $t\bar{t}$ dilepton events, the momenta of both neutrinos and correlations between them are reconstructed more accurately than when using the most popular standard analytical techniques, and solutions are found for all events. Inference time is significantly faster than competing methods, and can be reduced further by evaluating in parallel on graphics processing units. We apply $\nu^2$-Flows to $t\bar{t}$ dilepton events and show that the per-bin uncertainties in unfolded distributions is much closer to the limit of performance set by perfect neutrino reconstruction than standard techniques. For the chosen double differential observables $\nu^2$-Flows results in improved statistical precision for each bin by a factor of 1.5 to 2 in comparison to the Neutrino Weighting method and up to a factor of four in comparison to the Ellipse approach.

2023-07-05, **Multi-messenger observations support cosmic ray interactions surrounding acceleration sources**, Dong-Xu Sun et.al., [2307.02372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02372v1)

 The observations of the energy spectra of cosmic-ray have revealed complicated structures. Especially, spectral hardenings in the boron-to-carbon and boron-to-oxygen ratios above $\sim 200$ GV has been revealed by AMS-02 and DAMPE experiments. One scenario to account for the hardenings of secondary-to-primary ratios is the nuclear fragmentation of freshly accelerated particles around sources. In this work, we further study this scenario based on new observations of Galactic diffuse gamma rays by LHAASO and neutrinos by IceCube. We find that the spectra of cosmic ray nuclei, the diffuse ultra-high-energy gamma rays, and the Galactic component of neutrinos can be simultaneously explained, given an average confinement and interaction time of $\sim 0.25$ Myr around sources. These multi-messenger data thus provide evidence of non-negligible grammage of Galactic cosmic rays surrounding sources besides the traditional one during the propagation.

2023-07-05, **Constraints on Neutrino Self-Interactions from IceCube Observation of NGC 1068**, Jeffrey M. Hyde et.al., [2307.02361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02361v1)

 The active galaxy NGC 1068 was recently identified by the IceCube neutrino observatory as the first known steady-state, extragalactic neutrino point source, associated with about 79 events over ten years. We use the IceCube data to place limits on possible neutrino self-interactions mediated by scalar particles with mass between 1 - 10 MeV. We find that a flavor-specific $\nu\_{\tau}$ self-interaction is constrained beyond existing published bounds, while a flavor-universal self-interaction is not.

2023-07-05, **Disentangling the Hadronic Components in NGC 1068**, Marco Ajello et.al., [2307.02333v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02333v1)

 The recent detection of high-energy neutrinos by IceCube in the direction of the nearby Seyfert/starburst galaxy NGC 1068 implies that radio-quiet active galactic nuclei can accelerate cosmic-ray ions. Dedicated multi-messenger analyses suggest that the interaction of these high-energy ions { with ambient gas or photons} happens in a region of the galaxy that is highly opaque for GeV-TeV gamma rays. Otherwise, the GeV-TeV emission would violate existing constraints provided by {\it Fermi}-LAT and MAGIC. The conditions of high optical depth are realized near the central super-massive black hole (SMBH). At the same time, the GeV emission detected by the {\it Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT) is likely related to the galaxy's sustained star-formation activity. In this work, we derive a 20\,MeV - 1\,TeV spectrum of NGC 1068 using 14\,yrs of {\it Fermi}-LAT observations. We find that the starburst hadronic component is responsible for NGC 1068's emission above $\sim$500\,MeV. However, below this energy an additional component is required. In the 20-500\,MeV range the {\it Fermi}-LAT data are consistent with hadronic emission {initiated by non-thermal ions interacting with gas or photons} in the vicinity of the central SMBH. This highlights the importance of the MeV band to discover hidden cosmic-ray accelerators.

2023-07-05, **Probing neutrino production in blazars by millimeter VLBI**, Y. Y. Kovalev et.al., [2307.02267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02267v1)

 The advancement of neutrino observatories has sparked a surge in multi-messenger astronomy. Multiple neutrino associations among blazars are reported while neutrino production site is located within their central (sub)parsecs. Yet many questions remain on the nature of those processes. The next generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) is uniquely positioned for these studies, as its high frequency and resolution can probe both the accretion disk region and the parsec-scale jet. This opens up new opportunities for connecting the two regions and unraveling the proton acceleration and neutrino production in blazars. We outline observational strategies for ngEHT and highlight what it can contribute to the multi-messenger study of blazars.

2023-07-04, **Unveiling the Heavy Neutrino Nature at LHCb**, G. A. Vasquez et.al., [2307.01871v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01871v1)

 In this work, we study the lepton number violating Bc meson decays via one intermediate on-shell heavy neutrino. The specific studied process is $B\_{c}^{+} \to \mu^{+} \ N \to \mu^{+} \mu^{+} \tau^{-} \nu$ which could allow distinguishing the nature of the heavy neutrino nature (Dirac or Majorana) by studying the tau lepton energy spectrum in the LHCb experiment. The result suggests that this signature could be observed in the collected data during the HL-LHCb lifetime.

2023-07-04, **Long-Lived Particles and the Quiet Sun**, R. Andrew Gustafson et.al., [2307.01856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01856v1)

 The nuclear reaction network within the interior of the Sun is an efficient MeV physics factory, and can produce long-lived particles generic to dark sector models. In this work we consider the sensitivity of satellite instruments, primarily the RHESSI Spectrometer, that observe the Quiet Sun in the MeV regime where backgrounds are low. We find that Quiet Sun observations offer a powerful and complementary probe in regions of parameter space where the long-lived particle decay length is longer than the radius of the Sun, and shorter than the distance between the Sun and Earth. We comment on connections to recent model-building work on heavy neutral leptons coupled to neutrinos and high-quality axions from mirror symmetries.

2023-07-04, **Status of the muEDM experiment at PSI**, Kim Siang Khaw et.al., [2307.01535v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01535v1)

 Permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) are excellent probes of physics beyond the Standard Model, especially on new sources of CP violation. The muon EDM has recently attracted significant attention due to discrepancies in the magnetic anomaly of the muon, as well as potential violations of lepton-flavor universality in B-meson decays. At the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, we have proposed a muon EDM search experiment employing the frozen-spin technique, where a radial electric field is exerted within a storage solenoid to cancel the muon's anomalous spin precession. Consequently, the EDM signal can be inferred from the upstream-downstream asymmetry of the decay positron count versus time. The experiment is planned to take place in two phases, anticipating an annual statistical sensitivity of $3\times10^{-21}$ $e\cdot$cm for Phase~I, and $6\times10^{-23}$ $e\cdot$cm for Phase~II. Going beyond $10^{-21}$ $e\cdot$cm will enable us to probe various Standard Model extensions.

2023-07-05, **Search for Light Dark Matter with NA64 at CERN**, Yu. M. Andreev et.al., [2307.02404v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02404v1)

 Thermal dark matter models with particle $\chi$ masses below the electroweak scale can provide an explanation for the observed relic dark matter density. This would imply the existence of a new feeble interaction between the dark and ordinary matter. We report on a new search for the sub-GeV $\chi$ production through the interaction mediated by a new vector boson, called the dark photon $A'$, in collisions of 100 GeV electrons with the active target of the NA64 experiment at the CERN SPS. With $9.37\times10^{11}$ electrons on target collected during 2016-2022 runs NA64 probes for the first time the well-motivated region of parameter space of benchmark thermal scalar and fermionic dark matter models. No evidence for dark matter production has been found. This allows us to set the most sensitive limits on the $A'$ couplings to photons for masses $m\_{A'} \lesssim 0.35$ GeV, and to exclude scalar and Majorana dark matter with the $\chi-A'$ coupling $\alpha\_D \leq 0.1$ for masses $0.001 \lesssim m\_\chi \lesssim 0.1$ GeV and $3m\_\chi \leq m\_{A'}$.

2023-07-05, **Interacting quintessence cosmology from Noether symmetries: comparing theoretical predictions with observational data**, Ester Piedipalumbo et.al., [2307.02355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02355v1)

 In the framework of scalar-tensor gravity, we consider non-flat interacting quintessence cosmology where a scalar field is interacting with dark matter. Such a scalar field can be a standard or a phantom one. We use the Noether Symmetry Approach to obtain general exact solutions for cosmological equations and to select scalar-field self-interaction potentials. It turns out that the found solutions can reproduce the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and are compatible with observational dataset, as the SNeIa Pantheon data, gamma ray bursts Hubble diagram, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter.

2023-07-05, **Spin-1 Thermal Targets for Dark Matter Searches at Beam Dump and Fixed Target Experiments**, Riccardo Catena et.al., [2307.02207v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02207v1)

 The current framework for dark matter searches at beam dump and fixed target experiments relies on four benchmark models, the complex scalar, inelastic scalar, pseudo-Dirac and finally, Majorana DM models. While this approach has so far been successful in the interpretation of the available data, it a priori excludes the possibility that DM is made of spin-1 particles -- a restriction which is neither theoretically nor experimentally justified. In this work we extend the current landscape of sub-GeV DM models to a set of models for spin-1 DM, including a family of simplified models (involving one DM candidate and one mediator -- the dark photon) and an ultraviolet complete model based on a non-abelian gauge group where DM is a spin-1 Strongly Interacting Massive Particle. For each of these models, we calculate the DM relic density, the expected number of signal events at beam dump experiments, the rate of energy injection in the early universe thermal bath and in the Intergalactic Medium, as well as the helicity amplitudes for forward processes subject to the unitary bound. We then compare these predictions with experimental results from Planck, CMB surveys, IGM temperature observations, LSND, MiniBooNE, NA64, and BaBar and with available projections from LDMX and Belle II. Through this comparison, we identify the regions in the parameter space of the models considered in this work where DM is simultaneously thermally produced, compatible with present observations, and within reach at Belle II and LDMX. We find that the simplified models are strongly constrained by current beam dump experiments and the unitarity bound, and will thus be conclusively probed in the first stage of LDMX data taking. We also find that the SIMP model explored in this work predicts the observed DM abundance, is compatible with current observations and within reach at LDMX in a wide region of the parameter space.

2023-07-05, **Electroweak sphalerons, scalar multiplets, and symmetry breaking patterns**, Yanda Wu et.al., [2307.02187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02187v1)

 In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the electroweak sphaleron formalism and its application to electroweak phase transition (EWPT) patterns in extensions of the Standard Model scalar sector with electroweak multiplets. We offer an equivalence proof for different choices for the form of sphaleron configurations; construct the previously unestablished high-dimensional $\text{SU}(2)$ sphaleron transformation matrix; and revisit the required boundary conditions needed for solving the sphaleron field equations. We then investigate the leading order sphaleron dynamics in the context of a multi-step EWPT. We showcase two distinct analytical approaches for extending the $\text{SU}(2)$ scalar multiplet to the standard model (SM) under differing EWPT scenarios, and perform an explicit calculation of the sphaleron energy using a septuplet example. In the context of a single-step EWPT leading to a mixed phase, we find that the additional multiplet's contribution to the sphaleron energy is negligible, primarily due to the prevailing constraint imposed by the $\rho$ parameter. Conversely, in a two-step EWPT scenario, the sphaleron energy can achieve significantly high values during the initial phase, thereby markedly preserving baryon asymmetry if the universe undergoes a first-order EWPT. In both cases, we delineate the relationship between the sphaleron energy and the parameters relevant to dark matter phenomenology.

2023-07-04, **Testing Complex Singlet Scalar Cosmology at the Large Hadron Collider**, Wenxing Zhang et.al., [2307.01615v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01615v1)

 The Standard Model extended with a complex singlet scalar (cxSM) can admit a strong first order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) as needed for electroweak baryogenesis and provide a dark matter (DM) candidate. The presence of both a DM candidate and a singlet-like scalar that mixes with the Standard Model Higgs boson leads to the possibility of a $b\bar{b}+\text{MET}$ final state in $pp$ collisions. Focusing on this channel, we analyze the prospective reach at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for a heavy singlet-like scalar in regions of cxSM parameter space compatible with a SFOEWT and DM phenomenology. We identify this parameter space while implementing current constraints from electroweak precision observable and Higgs boson property measurements as well as those implied by LHC heavy resonance searches.

2023-07-04, **A comparative study of MOND and MOG theories versus the$Îº$-model: An application to galaxy clusters**, Gianni Pascoli et.al., [2307.01555v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01555v1)

 Many models have been proposed to minimize the dark matter (DM) content in various astronomical objects at every scale in the Universe. The most widely known model isMOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). MOND was first published by Mordehai Milgromin 1983 (Milgrom, 1983; 2015; see also Banik and Zhao, 2022 for a review). A second concurrent model is modified gravity (MOG), which is a covariant scalar-tensor-vector (STVG)extension of general relativity (Moffat, 2006; 2020). Other theories also exist but have notbeen broadly applied to a large list of astronomical objects (Mannheim and Kazanas, 1989;Capozziello and De Laurentis, 2012; O'Brien and Moss, 2015; Verlinde, 2017). A new model,called $\kappa$-model, based on very elementary phenomenological considerations, has recently beenproposed in the astrophysics field. This model shows that the presence of dark matter canbe considerably minimized with regard to the dynamics of galaxies (Pascoli, 2022 a,b). The$\kappa$-model belongs to the general family of theories descended from MOND. Under this familyof theories, there is no need to develop a highly uncertain dark matter sector of physics toexplain the observations.

# supernova (7)

2023-07-05, **A Precursor Plateau and Pre-Maximum [O II] Emission in the Superluminous SN2019szu: A Pulsational Pair-Instability Candidate**, Aysha Aamer et.al., [2307.02487v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02487v1)

 We present a detailed study on SN2019szu, a Type I superluminous supernova at $z=0.213$, that displayed unique photometric and spectroscopic properties. Pan-STARRS and ZTF forced photometry shows a pre-explosion plateau lasting $\sim$ 40 days. Unlike other SLSNe that show decreasing photospheric temperatures with time, the optical colours show an apparent temperature increase from $\sim$15000\,K to $\sim$20000\,K over the first 70 days, likely caused by an additional pseudo-continuum in the spectrum. Remarkably, the spectrum displays a forbidden emission line even during the rising phase of the light curve, inconsistent with an apparently compact photosphere. We show that this early feature is [O II] $\lambda\lambda$7320,7330. We also see evidence for [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007, and [O III] $\lambda$4363 further strengthening this line identification. Comparing with models for nebular emission, we find that the oxygen line fluxes and ratios can be reproduced with $\sim$0.25\,M$\_{\odot}$ of oxygen rich material with a density of $\sim10^{-15}\,\rm{g\,cm}^{-3}$. The low density suggests a circumstellar origin, but the early onset of the emission lines requires that this material was ejected within the final months before the terminal explosion, consistent with the timing of the precursor plateau. Interaction with denser material closer to the explosion likely produced the pseudo-continuum bluewards of $\sim$5500\,$\Angstrom$. We suggest that this event is one of the best candidates to date for a pulsational pair-instability ejection, with early pulses providing the low density material needed for the forbidden emission line, and collisions between the final shells of ejected material producing the pre-explosion plateau.

2023-07-05, **The tension in the absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae**, David Camarena et.al., [2307.02434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02434v1)

 This study aims to elucidate the tension in the Hubble constant ($H\_0$), a key metric in cosmology representing the universe's expansion rate. Conflicting results from independent measurements such as the Planck satellite mission and the SH0ES collaboration have sparked interest in exploring alternative cosmological models. We extend the analysis by SH0ES to an arbitrary cosmographic model, obtaining a competitive local $H\_0$ determination which only assumes the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model ($73.14 \pm 1.10$ km/s/Mpc), and another which only assumes the FLRW metric ($74.56 \pm 1.61$ km/s/Mpc). The study also stresses the importance of the supernova magnitude calibration ($M\_B$) in cosmological inference and highlights the tension in $M\_B$ when supernovae are calibrated either by CMB and BAO observations or the first two rungs of the cosmic distance ladder. This discrepancy, independent of the physics involved, suggests that models solely changing the Hubble flow and maintaining a sound horizon distance consistent with CMB, fail to explain the discrepancy between early- and late-time measurements of $H\_0$.

2023-07-05, **Sub-arcsecond resolution imaging of M 51 with the International LOFAR Telescope**, Deepika Venkattu et.al., [2307.02365v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02365v1)

 We present an International LOFAR Telescope sub-arcsecond resolution image of the nearby galaxy M 51 with a beam size of 0.436" x 0.366" and rms of 46 $\mu$Jy. We compare this image with an European VLBI Network study of M 51, and discuss the supernovae in this galaxy, which have not yet been probed at these low radio frequencies. We find a flux density of 0.97 mJy for SN 2011dh in the ILT image, which is about five times smaller than the flux density reported by the LOFAR Twometre Sky Survey at 6" resolution using the same dataset without the international stations. This difference makes evident the need for LOFAR international baselines to reliably obtain flux density measurements of compact objects in nearby galaxies. Our LOFAR flux density measurement of SN 2011dh directly translates into fitting the radio light curves for the supernova and constraining massloss rates of progenitor star. We do not detect two other supernovae in the same galaxy, SN 1994I and SN 2005cs, and our observations place limits on the evolution of both supernovae at radio wavelengths. We also discuss the radio emission from the centre of M 51, in which we detect the Active Galactic Nucleus and other parts of the nuclear emission in the galaxy, and a possible detection of Component N. We discuss a few other sources, including the detection of a High mass X-ray Binary not detected by LoTSS, but with a flux density in the ILT image that matches well with higher frequency catalogues.

2023-07-05, **Possible Circumstellar Interaction Origin of the Early Excess Emission in Thermonuclear Supernovae**, Maokai Hu et.al., [2307.02186v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02186v1)

 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) arise from the thermonuclear explosion in binary systems involving carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs). The pathway of WDs acquiring mass may produce circumstellar material (CSM). Observing SNe Ia within a few hours to a few days after the explosion can provide insight into the nature of CSM relating to the progenitor systems. In this paper, we propose a CSM model to investigate the effect of ejecta-CSM interaction on the early-time multi-band light curves of SNe Ia. By varying the mass-loss history of the progenitor system, we apply the ejecta-CSM interaction model to fit the optical and ultraviolet (UV) photometric data of eight SNe Ia with early excess. The photometric data of SNe Ia in our sample can be well-matched by our CSM model except for the UV-band light curve of iPTF14atg, indicating its early excess may not be due to the ejecta-CSM interaction. Meanwhile, the CSM interaction can generate synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in the shocked gas, making radio observations a distinctive probe of CSM. The radio luminosity based on our models suggests that positive detection of the radio signal is only possible within a few days after the explosion at higher radio frequencies (e.g., ~250 GHz); at lower frequencies (e.g., ~1.5 GHz) the detection is difficult. These models lead us to conclude that a multi-messenger approach that involves UV, optical, and radio observations of SNe Ia a few days past explosion is needed to address many of the outstanding questions concerning the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.

2023-07-04, **A Catalogue of Radio Supernova Remnants and Candidate Supernova Remnants in the EMU/POSSUM Galactic Pilot Field**, Brianna D. Ball et.al., [2307.01948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01948v1)

 We use data from the pilot observations of the EMU/POSSUM surveys to study the "missing supernova remnant (SNR) problem", the discrepancy between the number of Galactic SNRs that have been observed and the number that are estimated to exist. The Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) and the Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) are radio sky surveys that are conducted using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We report on the properties of 7 known SNRs in the joint Galactic pilot field, with an approximate longitude and latitude of 323$^\circ\leq$ l $\leq$ 330$^\circ$ and -4$^\circ\leq$ b $\leq$ 2$^\circ$ respectively, and identify 21 SNR candidates. Of these, 4 have been previously identified as SNR candidates, 3 were previously listed as a single SNR, 13 have not been previously studied, and 1 has been studied in the infrared. These are the first discoveries of Galactic SNR candidates with EMU/POSSUM and, if confirmed, they will increase the SNR density in this field by a factor of 4. By comparing our SNR candidates to the known Galactic SNR population, we demonstrate that many of these sources were likely missed in previous surveys due to their small angular size and/or low surface brightness. We suspect that there are SNRs in this field that remain undetected due to limitations set by the local background and confusion with other radio sources. The results of this paper demonstrate the potential of the full EMU/POSSUM surveys to uncover more of the missing Galactic SNR population.

2023-07-04, **Finding LoTSS of hosts for GRBs: a search for galaxy - gamma-ray burst coincidences at low frequencies with LOFAR**, R. A. J. Eyles-Ferris et.al., [2307.01731v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01731v1)

 The LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) is an invaluable new tool for investigating the properties of sources at low frequencies and has helped to open up the study of galaxy populations in this regime. In this work, we perform a search for host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We use the relative density of sources in Data Release 2 of LoTSS to define the probability of a chance alignment, $P\_{\rm chance}$, and find 18 sources corresponding to 17 GRBs which meet a $P\_{\rm chance}$<1% criterion. We examine the nature and properties of these radio sources using both LOFAR data and broadband information, including their radio spectral index, star formation rate estimates and any contributions from active galactic nucleus emission. Assuming the radio emission is dominated by star formation, we find that our sources show high star formation rates ($10^1$-$10^3$ $M\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) compared with both a field galaxy sample and a sample of core-collapse supernova hosts, and the majority of putative hosts are consistent with ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) classifications. As a result of our analyses, we define a final sample of eight likely GRB host candidates in the LoTSS DR2 survey.

2023-07-04, **Cosmic rays from star clusters**, Stefano Gabici et.al., [2307.01596v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01596v1)

 Massive stars blow powerful winds and eventually explode as supernovae. By doing so, they inject energy and momentum in the circumstellar medium, which is pushed away from the star and piles up to form a dense and expanding shell of gas. The effect is larger when many massive stars are grouped together in bound clusters or associations. Large cavities form around clusters as a result of the stellar feedback on the ambient medium. They are called superbubbles and are characterised by the presence of turbulent and supersonic gas motions. This makes star clusters ideal environments for particle acceleration, and potential contributors to the observed Galactic cosmic ray intensity.
