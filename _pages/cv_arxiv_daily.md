2025-05-29, **Hybrid-Graph Neural Network Method for Muon Fast Reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes**, Cen Mo et.al., [2505.23425v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23425v1)

 Fast and accurate muon reconstruction is crucial for neutrino telescopes to improve experimental sensitivity and enable online triggering. This paper introduces a Hybrid-Graph Neural Network (GNN) method tailored for efficient muon track reconstruction, leveraging the robustness of GNNs alongside traditional physics-based approaches. The "LITE GNN model" achieves a runtime of 0.19-0.29 ms per event on GPUs, offering a three orders of magnitude speedup compared to traditional likelihood-based methods while maintaining a high reconstruction accuracy. For high-energy muons (10-100 TeV), the median angular error is approximately 0.1 degrees, with errors in reconstructed Cherenkov photon emission positions being below 3-5 meters, depending on the GNN model used. Furthermore, the Semi-GNN method offers a mechanism to assess the quality of event reconstruction, enabling the identification and exclusion of poorly reconstructed events. These results establish the GNN-based approach as a promising solution for next-generation neutrino telescope data reconstruction.

 The quantum gravity scale within the dark dimension scenario ($M\_* \sim 10^{9}~{\rm GeV}$) roughly coincides with the energy scale of the KM3-230213A neutrino ($E\_\nu \sim 10^{8}~{\rm GeV}$). We propose an interpretation for this intriguing coincidence in terms of Hawking evaporation of five-dimensional (5D) primordial black holes (PBHs). 5D PBHs are bigger, colder, and longer-lived than 4D PBHs of the same mass. For brane observers, PBHs decay essentially invisibly (only through gravitationally coupled modes), with a possible hot (temperature $\sim 10^{8}~{\rm GeV}$) flare of Standard Model particles in the final-stage emission. As a consequence, constraints on the density of PBHs relative to that of dark matter from null searches of Hawking evaporation can be avoided. We show that Hawking evaporation of 5D PBHs can accommodate the KM3-230213A neutrino event and remain consistent with IceCube upper limits on the partial decay width of superheavy dark matter particles into neutrinos.

2025-05-28, **`Dark' Matter Effect as a Novel Solution to the KM3-230213A Puzzle**, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., [2505.22754v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22754v1)

 The recent KM3NeT observation of the ${\cal O}(100~{\rm PeV})$ event KM3-230213A is puzzling because IceCube with much larger effective area times exposure has not found any such events. We propose a novel solution to this conundrum in terms of dark matter (DM) scattering in the Earth's crust. We show that intermediate dark-sector particles that decay into muons are copiously produced when high-energy ($\sim100~\text{PeV}$) DM propagates through a sufficient amount of Earth overburden. The same interactions responsible for DM scattering in Earth also source the boosted DM flux from a high-luminosity blazar. We address the non-observation of similar events at IceCube via two examples of weakly coupled long-lived dark sector scenarios that satisfy all the lab-based constraints. We calculate the corresponding dark sector cross sections, lifetimes and blazar luminosities required to yield one event at KM3NeT, and also predict the number of IceCube events for these parameters that can be tested very soon. Our proposed DM explanation of the event can also be distinguished from a neutrino-induced event in future high-energy neutrino flavor analyses, large-scale DM direct detection experiments, as well as at future colliders.

2025-05-28, **Explaining the PeV Neutrino Fluxes at KM3NeT and IceCube with Quasi-Extremal Primordial Black Holes**, Michael J. Baker et.al., [2505.22722v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22722v1)

 The KM3NeT experiment has recently observed a neutrino with an energy around 100 PeV, and IceCube has detected five neutrinos with energies above 1 PeV. While there are no known astrophysical sources, exploding primordial black holes could have produced these high-energy neutrinos. For Schwarzschild black holes this interpretation results in tensions between the burst rates inferred from the KM3NeT and IceCube observations, and with indirect constraints from the extragalactic gamma ray background. In this letter we show that if there is a population of primordial black holes charged under a new dark $u(1)$ symmetry which spend most of their time in a quasi-extremal state, the neutrino emission at 1 PeV may be more suppressed than at 100 PeV. The burst rates implied by the KM3NeT and IceCube observations and the indirect constraints can then all be consistent at $1\sigma$. Furthermore, these black holes could constitute all of the observed dark matter in the universe.

2025-05-28, **Astrophysical sources of dark particles as a solution to the KM3NeT and IceCube tension over KM3-230213A**, Yasaman Farzan et.al., [2505.22711v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22711v1)

 We entertain the possibility that transient astrophysical sources can produce a flux of dark particles that induce ultra-high-energy signatures at neutrino telescopes such as IceCube and KM3NeT. We construct scenarios where such ``dark flux" can produce meta-stable dark particles inside the Earth that subsequently decay to muons, inducing through-going tracks in large-volume neutrino detectors. We consider such a scenario in light of the $\mathcal{O}(70)$~PeV ultra-high-energy muon observed by KM3NeT and argue that because of its location in the sky and the strong geometrical dependence of the signal, such events would not necessarily have been observed by IceCube. Our model relies on the upscattering of a new particle $X$ onto new metastable particles that decay to dimuons with decay lengths of $\mathcal{O}(100)$~km. This scenario can explain the observation by KM3NeT without being in conflict with the IceCube data.

2025-05-28, **Genesis of Baryon and Dark Matter Asymmetries through Ultraviolet Scattering Freeze-in**, Pouya Asadi et.al., [2505.22710v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22710v1)

 We introduce a new mechanism for the simultaneous generation of baryon and dark matter asymmetries through ultraviolet-dominated freeze-in scatterings. The mechanism relies on heavy Majorana neutrinos that connect the visible Standard Model sector to a dark sector through the neutrino portal. Following reheating of the visible sector to a temperature well below the heavy neutrino masses, we show that 2-to-2 scattering processes can populate the dark sector and generate both baryon and dark matter asymmetries. In some parameter regions, the dominant source of baryon asymmetry can be charge transfer from the dark sector, a process we call dark wash-in. We also demonstrate that annihilation of the dark matter to massless states within the dark sector can deplete the symmetric population without destroying the net baryon charge to leave only an asymmetric dark matter abundance today. Depending on the specific model parameters, the observed baryon and dark matter abundances can be attained with heavy neutrino masses $M\_N \gtrsim 10^{10}$ GeV, and dark matter masses in the range 0.1 GeV $\lesssim m\_\chi \lesssim 10^3$ GeV if the dark matter relic abundance is mainly asymmetric and even lower masses if it is symmetric.

2025-05-28, **First measurement of neutron capture multiplicity in neutrino-oxygen neutral-current quasi-elastic-like interactions using an accelerator neutrino beam**, T2K Collaboration et.al., [2505.22547v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22547v1)

 We report the first measurement of neutron capture multiplicity in neutrino-oxygen neutral-current quasi-elastic-like interactions at the gadolinium-loaded Super-Kamiokande detector using the T2K neutrino beam, which has a peak energy of about 0.6 GeV. A total of 30 neutral-current quasi-elastic-like event candidates were selected from T2K data corresponding to an exposure of $1.76\times10^{20}$ protons on target. The $\gamma$ ray signals resulting from neutron captures were identified using a neural network. The flux-averaged mean neutron capture multiplicity was measured to be $1.37\pm0.33\text{ (stat.)}$$(^{+0.17}\_{-0.27})$, which is compatible within $2.3\,\sigma$ than predictions obtained using our nominal simulation. We discuss potential sources of systematic uncertainty in the prediction and demonstrate that a significant portion of this discrepancy arises from the modeling of hadron-nucleus interactions in the detector medium.

2025-05-28, **Opening up New Parameter Space for Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter**, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., [2505.22463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22463v1)

 Sterile neutrinos are compelling dark matter (DM) candidates, yet the minimal production mechanism solely based on active ($\nu\_a$)-sterile ($\nu\_s$) oscillations is excluded by astrophysical observations. Non-standard self-interactions in either active ($\nu\_a-\nu\_a$) or sterile ($\nu\_s-\nu\_s$) sector are known to alter the sterile neutrino DM production in the early Universe, which could alleviate the tension with astrophysical constraints to some extent. Here we propose a novel solution where scalar-mediated non-standard interactions between active and sterile neutrinos ($\nu\_a-\nu\_s$) generate new production channels for $\nu\_s$, independent of the active-sterile mixing and without the need for any fine-tuned resonance or primordial lepton asymmetry. This framework enables efficient sterile neutrino DM production even at vanishingly small mixing angles and opens up new viable regions of parameter space that can be tested with future $X$-ray and gamma-ray observations.

2025-05-28, **IceCube PeV neutrinos from heavy dark matter decay with 12 years HESE data**, Diptarko Mukherjee et.al., [2505.22204v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22204v1)

 The decay of superheavy dark matter from the early universe may undergo decay via QCD cascades and electroweak cascade to produce neutrinos as one of the decay products. We consider the neutrino events in and around PeV region reported by IceCube collaboration are due to the decay of such heavy dark matter. The neutrino spectrum could be from the decay processes via hadronic decay modes and/or leptonic decay modes. Using the numerical evolution of QCD cascades as well as electroweak corrections where use has been made of DGLAP equations, the neutrino fluxes from the heavy dark matter decay have been computed. The mass of the decaying superheavy dark matter and its decay lifetime have then been estimated from a $\chi^2$ analysis of the IceCube 12-year data. The fractional contribution ($f\_{\rm lep}$) of the leptonic decay channel in such a decay process is also estimated from the same $\chi^2$ analyses. It is seen that to explain the IceCube 12-year ultrahigh energy (UHE) events the mass of a decaying superheavy dark matter would be $\sim9.4\times 10^6$ GeV and decay time $\tau \simeq 4.2 \times 10^{28}$ second. It is also found that the lepton channel contribution is very small, $f\_{\rm lep} \sim 0.001$.

2025-05-28, **Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays**, Noémie Globus et.al., [2505.21846v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21846v1)

 Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, UHECR, are charged particles with energies between $\sim10^{18}\,{\rm eV}$ and $\sim3\times10^{20}\,{\rm eV}\sim50\,{\rm J}$. They exhibit fundamental physics at energies inaccessible to terrestrial accelerators, challenge experimental physics and connect strongly to astronomical observations through electromagnetic, neutrino and even gravitational wave channels. There has been much theoretical and observational progress in the sixty years that have elapsed since the discovery of UHECR, to divine their nature and identify their sources. The highest energy UHECR appear to be heavy nuclei with rigidity extending up to $\sim10\,{\rm EV}$; A significant ($6.9\sigma$) dipole anisotropy has been measured but our poor understanding of the Galactic magnetic fields makes this hard to interpret; The UHECR luminosity density is $\sim 10^{44}$ erg Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ which constrains explanations of their origin; The most promising acceleration mechanisms involve diffusive shock acceleration and unipolar induction; The most promising sources include intergalactic accretion shocks, and relativistic jets from stellar-mass or supermassive black holes. We explore the prospects for using the highest energy events, combined with multimessenger astronomy, to help us solve the riddle of UHECR.

2025-05-29, **Turbulence in Primordial Dark Matter Halos and Its Impact on the First Star Formation**, Meng-Yuan Ho et.al., [2505.23768v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23768v1)

 We present high-resolution simulations of the first star-forming clouds in 15 minihalos with masses ranging from $\sim 10^5$ to $10^7\ \text{M}\_{\odot}$ at redshifts $z \sim 17 - 20$, using the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations incorporate detailed primordial gas physics and adopt initial conditions from the state-of-the-art TNG cosmological simulations. To achieve the required resolution, we apply a particle-splitting technique that increases the resolution of the original TNG data by a factor of $\sim 10^5$, reaching gas and dark matter particle masses of $0.2\ \text{M}\_{\odot}$ and $80\ \text{M}\_{\odot}$, respectively. This enables us to resolve gas accretion during the early assembly of minihalos and to capture the emergence of strong turbulent flows. We find that turbulence, driven by gas infall into the dark matter potential wells, is predominantly supersonic, with characteristic Mach numbers ranging from $1.8$ to $4.2$, increasing with halo mass. The supersonic turbulence effectively fragments the central gas cloud into multiple dense clumps, some of which form gravitationally bound cores and begin to collapse into the first stars. Our results suggest that supersonic turbulence is a common feature in minihalos and plays a key role in generating clumpy star-forming clouds, with important implications for the initial mass function of the first stars.

2025-05-29, **Colloquium: The Cosmic Dipole Anomaly**, Nathan Secrest et.al., [2505.23526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23526v1)

 The Cosmological Principle, which states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic (when averaged on large scales), is the foundational assumption of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies such as the current standard Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model. This simplification yields an exact solution to the Einstein field equations that relates space and time through a single time-dependent scale factor, which defines cosmological observables such as the Hubble parameter and the cosmological redshift. The validity of the Cosmological Principle, which underpins modern cosmology, can now be rigorously tested with the advent of large, nearly all-sky catalogs of radio galaxies and quasars. Surprisingly, the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is found to be inconsistent with the expectation from kinematic aberration and Doppler boosting effects in a perturbed FLRW universe, which is the standard interpretation of the observed dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although the matter dipole agrees in direction with that of the CMB dipole, it is anomalously larger, demonstrating that either the rest frames in which matter and radiation appear isotropic are not the same, or that there is an unexpected intrinsic anisotropy in at least one of them. This discrepancy now exceeds 5{\sigma} in significance. We review these recent findings, as well as the potential biases, systematic issues, and alternate interpretations that have been suggested to help alleviate the tension. We conclude that the cosmic dipole anomaly poses a serious challenge to FLRW cosmology, and the standard {\Lambda}CDM model in particular, as an adequate description of our Universe.

2025-05-29, **Toward a simultaneous resolution of the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions: early dark energy and an interacting dark sector model**, Mai Yashiki et.al., [2505.23382v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23382v1)

 The tension between the Hubble constant ($H\_0$) inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and that measured from late-time observations, such as the local distance ladder, is a major challenge in modern cosmology. Early dark energy (EDE) has been proposed as a possible resolution to the $H\_0$ tension, but it typically worsens the $S\_8$ tension by enhancing the small-scale matter power spectrum due to an increased cold dark matter density. To address this issue, we propose a model that combines EDE with an interacting dark energy-dark matter (iDEDM) scenario, and investigate whether this mixed model can simultaneously resolve both tensions. We find that the DE-DM interaction suppress the growth of structure and reduce $S\_8$, while EDE contributes to increase $H\_0$, although less effectively than in the EDE-only case. Our MCMC analysis using Planck 2018, DESI BAO, DES, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data shows that the mixed model provides modest improvements in both tensions, although it does not fully resolve either. This limitation appears to stem from the fact that both EDE and iDEDM independently favor a higher present-day matter density, which reduces the angular diameter distance and limits the degree to which EDE can lower the sound horizon.

2025-05-29, **Compartmentalization in the Dark Sector of the Universe after DESI DR2 BAO data**, Marcel van der Westhuizen et.al., [2505.23306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23306v1)

 We consider a non-linear interaction between the dark matter and dark energy components of the universe. In particular, within the FLRW geometry, where dark matter is described by a dust fluid and dark energy by an ideal gas with a constant equation of state parameter, we introduce energy transfer between the two fluids. The effective cosmological fluid leads to a unified dynamical dark energy model with the feature that the Hubble function admits an analytic expression. We study this model using the DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations data and the Supernova data from Pantheon+. The interacting model fits the data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\chi\_{\text{model}}^{2}-\chi\_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}^{2}=-5$. Using the Akaike Information Criterion to compare the two models, we derive $\text{AIC}\_{\operatorname{model}}-\text{AIC}\_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}=-1$, from which we conclude that the interacting model is marginally better supported by the data than the $\Lambda$CDM, but the difference is not statistically significant.

2025-05-29, **Dark clouds to silver linings over the hyperchargeless scalar triplets**, Priyotosh Bandyopadhyay et.al., [2505.23257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23257v1)

 A real scalar triplet with zero hypercharge offers a minimal non-trivial extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a charged Higgs and a possible dark matter or custodial symmetry breaking signature. The $Z\_2$-odd inert triplet model (ITM) provides a dark matter, while the non-inert Higgs triplet model (HTM) breaks the custodial symmetry, enabling rich collider signatures. Both these models also promise the viability of a first-order phase transition (FOPT). This letter revisits both models under various theoretical and current experimental constraints, revealing a trade-off between DM and FOPT viability, and explores the resulting gravitational wave signals and collider prospects.

2025-05-28, **The galaxy-halo connection of disc galaxies over six orders of magnitude in stellar mass**, Pavel E. Mancera Piña et.al., [2505.22727v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22727v1)

 (Abridged) The relations between stellar ($M\_\ast$), gas ($M\_{\rm gas}$), baryonic ($M\_{\rm bar} = M\_\ast + M\_{\rm gas}$), and dark matter halo mass ($M\_{200}$) provide unique constraints on galaxy formation and cosmology. The shape of the relations constrains how galaxies regulate their growth through gas accretion, star formation, and feedback; their scatter probes the stochasticity of galaxy assembly.   Here, we assemble a sample of 49 nearby gas-rich dwarf and massive disc galaxies with unmatched ancillary data. We obtain their gas kinematics and derive their dark matter properties through rotation curve decomposition. Our sample allows us to study the galaxy-halo connection across nearly six orders of magnitude in $M\_\ast$. We find that the $M\_{\rm gas}-M\_{200}$ relation rises monotonically, with galaxies having around 4 per cent of the average cosmological baryon fraction in cold gas. Contrastingly, the $M\_\ast-M\_{200}$ relation shows a more complex behaviour. A particularly interesting finding is that of a population of baryon-deficient' dwarfs (BDDs) with stellar masses $\sim 1-1.5$ orders of magnitude lower than expected from current models. Yet, baryon-rich galaxies also exist, and we find a large spread in the baryon retention fraction across our galaxies. We compare our findings with semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations. While the simulations broadly reproduce most observed features, they struggle to match the BDDs and do not capture the diversity in baryon fractions. Understanding these differences will shed new light on how feedback regulates galaxy formation. Finally, we study the dark matter halo concentration-mass relation. We find that below $M\_{200} \sim 10^{11}\,M\_\odot$, the concentrations are systematically lower than expected. We discuss whether these results stem from the influence of baryonic physics or the environment.

2025-05-28, **On Pulsar Timing Detection of Ultralight Vector Dark Matter**, Jeff A. Dror et.al., [2505.22719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22719v1)

 Ultralight vector dark matter induces metric fluctuations that generate timing residuals in the arrival times of pulsar emissions through two distinct modes: a fast mode, sourced by coherent field oscillations, and a slow mode, arising from interference patterns. These modes enable the detection of vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24} - 10^{-22}\ \mathrm{eV}$ and $m \sim 10^{-18} - 10^{-16}\ \mathrm{eV}$, respectively, using pulsar timing arrays. While previous studies have explored the fast mode, they neglect the full statistical treatment of the vector field and a precise treatment of its polarization structure. In this work, we investigate the timing residuals from both modes, fully accounting for the statistical properties of ultralight vector dark matter, assuming equipartition among its three polarization states. The two-point correlation functions of timing residuals that we derive serve as direct tools for identifying vector dark matter signatures as a stochastic background in pulsar timing data.

2025-05-28, **Stellar Mass Segregation in Dark Matter Halos**, Raphaël Errani et.al., [2505.22717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22717v1)

 We study the effect of stellar mass segregation driven by collisional relaxation within the potential well of a smooth dark matter halo. This effect is of particular relevance for old stellar systems with short crossing times, where small collisional perturbations accumulate over many dynamical time scales. We run collisional $N$-body simulations tailored to the ambiguous stellar systems Ursa Major 3/Unions 1, Delve 1 and Eridanus 3, modelling their stellar populations as two-component systems of high- and low-mass stars, respectively. For Ursa Major 3/Unions 1 (Delve 1), assuming a dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio of 10, we find that after 10 Gyr of evolution, the radial extent of its low-mass stars will be twice as large (40 per cent larger) than that of its high-mass stars. We show that weak tides do not alter this relative separation of half-light radii, whereas for the case of strong tidal fields, mass segregation facilitates the tidal stripping of low-mass stars. We further find that as the population of high-mass stars contracts and cools, the number of dynamically formed binaries within that population increases. Our results call for caution when using stellar mass segregation as a criterion to separate star clusters from dwarf galaxies, and suggest that mass segregation increases the abundance of massive binaries in the central regions of dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies.

2025-05-28, **Attention-based Neural Network Emulators for Multi-Probe Data Vectors Part III: Modeling The Next Generation Surveys**, Yijie Zhu et.al., [2505.22574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22574v1)

 Machine learning can accelerate cosmological inferences that involve many sequential evaluations of computationally expensive data vectors. Previous works in this series have examined how machine learning architectures impact emulator accuracy and training time for optical shear and galaxy clustering 2-point function. In this final manuscript, we explore neural network performance when emulating Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization power spectra. We maximize the volume of applicability in the parameter space of our emulators within the standard $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter model while ensuring that errors are below cosmic variance. Relative to standard multi-layer perceptron architectures, we find the dot-product-attention mechanism reduces the number of outliers among testing cosmologies, defined as the fraction of testing points with $\Delta \chi^2 > 0.2$ relative to \textsc{CAMB} outputs, for a wide range of training set sizes. Such precision enables attention-based emulators to be directly applied to real data without requiring any additional correction via importance sampling. Combined with pre-processing techniques and optimized activation and loss functions, attention-based models can meet the precision criteria set by current and future CMB and lensing experiments. For each of Planck, Simons Observatory, CMB S4, and CMB HD, we find the fraction of outlier points to be less than $10\%$ with around $2\times10^5$ to $4\times10^5$ training data vectors. We further explore the applications of these methods to supernova distance, weak lensing, and galaxy clustering, as well as alternative architectures and pre-processing techniques.

2025-05-28, **Bayesian reconstruction of primordial perturbations from induced gravitational waves**, Aya Ghaleb et.al., [2505.22534v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22534v1)

 The formation of primordial black holes or other dark matter relics from amplified density fluctuations in the early universe may also generate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GW), carrying vital information about the primordial power spectrum and the early expansion history of our universe. We present a Bayesian approach aimed at reconstructing both the shape of the scalar power spectrum and the universe's equation of state from GW observations, using interpolating splines to flexibly capture features in the GW data. The optimal number of spline nodes is chosen via Bayesian evidence, aiming at balancing complexity of the model and the fidelity of the reconstruction. We test our method using both representative mock data and recent Pulsar Timing Array measurements, demonstrating that it can accurately reconstruct the curvature power spectrum as well as the underlying equation of state, if different from radiation.

2025-05-28, **Gravitational wave signatures of primordial black hole accretion during early matter domination**, Rouzbeh Allahverdi et.al., [2505.21885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21885v1)

 We present a scenario in which primordial black holes (PBHs) form in a post-inflationary radiation-dominated (RD) phase and then experience significant accretion during a phase of early matter dominated (EMD). We show that PBH masses could grow by up to two orders of magnitude. Restricting to the linear perturbation regime, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum that features two peaks. The high-frequency peak is associated with the PBH formation in the RD phase, while the low-frequency peak is due to the sudden transition from EMD to the later, standard RD phase. We identify a PBH mass range where one or both peaks can be observed by a combination of different GW detectors. Finally, we show the signal-to-noise ratio of the total GW spectrum for PBHs in the asteroid mass window, where they could comprise the totality of dark matter.

2025-05-29, **The ambiguous AT2022rze: Changing-look AGN mimicking a supernova in a merging galaxy system**, P. J. Pessi et.al., [2505.23731v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23731v1)

 AT2022rze is a luminous, ambiguous transient located South-East of the geometric center of its host galaxy at redshift z = 0.08. The host appears to be formed by a merging galaxy system. The observed characteristics of AT2022rze are reminiscent of active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events (TDEs), and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of -20.2 +- 0.2 mag, showing a sharp rise (trise,1/e = 27.5 +- 0.6 days) followed by a slow decline (tdec,1/e = 382.9 +- 0.6). Its bumpy light curve and narrow Balmer lines indicate the presence of gas (and dust). Its light curve shows rather red colors, indicating that the transient could be affected by significant host extinction. The spectra reveal coronal lines, indicative of high-energy (X-ray/UV) emission. Archival data reveal no prior activity at this location, disfavoring a steady-state AGN, although an optical spectrum obtained prior to the transient is consistent with an AGN classification of the host. Based on this, we conclude that the transient most likely represents a Changing-look AGN at the center of the smallest component of the merging system.

2025-05-29, **An energy approach to pulsar-disc interaction: disc stability and implications for transitional millisecond pulsars**, Eda Vurgun et.al., [2505.23407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23407v1)

 The stability of an accretion disc surrounding a millisecond pulsar is analysed from an energetic point of view, using magnetohydrodynamic simulations that consider realistic disc structures and a variety of magnetic field inclination angles. The time-averaged components of the magnetic field interact with the disc through ohmic dissipation, which causes heating and partial evaporation of its innermost region. The stability of the disc right after the magnetic field is turned on is analysed as a function of the location of the inner radius of the disc and the magnetic inclination angle. Our results show that the disc is severely altered in those cases where its inner radius lies well beyond the light cylinder and the magnetic axis is not totally aligned with the neutron star spin axis. Overall, the results of the simulations agree with those obtained in previous works where analytical or semi-analytical energy models were also used to discuss the stability of the disc. The implications for the understanding of the transitional millisecond pulsars are discussed. We briefly mention implications of our results for low-mass X-ray binaries and supernova fallback discs.

2025-05-29, **Compartmentalization in the Dark Sector of the Universe after DESI DR2 BAO data**, Marcel van der Westhuizen et.al., [2505.23306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23306v1)

 We consider a non-linear interaction between the dark matter and dark energy components of the universe. In particular, within the FLRW geometry, where dark matter is described by a dust fluid and dark energy by an ideal gas with a constant equation of state parameter, we introduce energy transfer between the two fluids. The effective cosmological fluid leads to a unified dynamical dark energy model with the feature that the Hubble function admits an analytic expression. We study this model using the DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations data and the Supernova data from Pantheon+. The interacting model fits the data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\chi\_{\text{model}}^{2}-\chi\_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}^{2}=-5$. Using the Akaike Information Criterion to compare the two models, we derive $\text{AIC}\_{\operatorname{model}}-\text{AIC}\_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}=-1$, from which we conclude that the interacting model is marginally better supported by the data than the $\Lambda$CDM, but the difference is not statistically significant.

2025-05-29, **Effect of positronium on the $γ$-ray spectra and energy deposition in Type Ia supernovae**, Anirban Dutta et.al., [2505.22992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22992v1)

 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are powered by the radioactive decay of isotopes such as $^{56}$Ni and $^{56}$Co, making their $\gamma$-ray spectra useful probes of the explosion mechanism and ejecta structure. Accurate interpretation of $\gamma$-ray observables, including line ratios and continuum fluxes, requires a detailed understanding of the microphysical processes that shape the spectra. One such process is positronium formation during electron-positron annihilation, which can redistribute flux from the 511 keV line into the surrounding continuum. To assess the impact of positronium on the emergent spectra, we developed a new open-source module TARDIS-HE, for time-dependent three-dimensional $\gamma$-ray transport, integrated into the radiative transfer code TARDIS. The code simulates $\gamma$-ray spectra and light curves from one-dimensional supernova ejecta models and allows for flexible incorporation of decay chains and opacity treatments. Using TARDIS-HE, we explore the effect of positronium formation by varying the positronium fraction from 0 % to 100 %, and assuming an extreme case where 75 % of positronium decays result in three-photon emission. We find that full positronium formation can reduce the 511 keV line flux by approximately 70 % and modestly enhance energy deposition by up to 2 % at around 100 days post-explosion, compared to models without positronium. These results demonstrate that while the effect is not dominant, positronium formation introduces measurable changes to $\gamma$-ray observables. Future observations with missions such as the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) may offer constraints on positronium formation in SNe Ia and help refine models of their radioactive energy transport.

 Machine learning can accelerate cosmological inferences that involve many sequential evaluations of computationally expensive data vectors. Previous works in this series have examined how machine learning architectures impact emulator accuracy and training time for optical shear and galaxy clustering 2-point function. In this final manuscript, we explore neural network performance when emulating Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization power spectra. We maximize the volume of applicability in the parameter space of our emulators within the standard $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter model while ensuring that errors are below cosmic variance. Relative to standard multi-layer perceptron architectures, we find the dot-product-attention mechanism reduces the number of outliers among testing cosmologies, defined as the fraction of testing points with $\Delta \chi^2 > 0.2$ relative to \textsc{CAMB} outputs, for a wide range of training set sizes. Such precision enables attention-based emulators to be directly applied to real data without requiring any additional correction via importance sampling. Combined with pre-processing techniques and optimized activation and loss functions, attention-based models can meet the precision criteria set by current and future CMB and lensing experiments. For each of Planck, Simons Observatory, CMB S4, and CMB HD, we find the fraction of outlier points to be less than $10\%$ with around $2\times10^5$ to $4\times10^5$ training data vectors. We further explore the applications of these methods to supernova distance, weak lensing, and galaxy clustering, as well as alternative architectures and pre-processing techniques.

2025-05-28, **Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with improved inverse distance ladder**, Jia-Le Ling et.al., [2505.22369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369v1)

 Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H\_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p\_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.

2025-05-28, **Constraining the Hubble parameter with the 21 cm brightness temperature signal in a universe with inhomogeneities**, Subhadeep Mukherjee et.al., [2505.22219v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22219v1)

 We consider the 21\,cm brightness temperature as a probe of the Hubble tension in the framework of an inhomogeneous cosmological model. Employing Buchert's averaging formalism to study the effect of inhomogeneities on the background evolution, we consider scaling laws for the backreaction and curvature consistent with structure formation simulations. We calibrate the effective matter density using MCMC analysis using Union 2.1 Supernova Ia data. Our results show that a higher Hubble constant ($\sim73$\,km/s/Mpc) leads to a shallower absorption feature in the brightness temperature versus redshift curve. On the other hand, a lower value ($\sim67$\,km/s/Mpc) produces a remarkable dip in the brightness temperature $T\_{21}$. Such a substantial difference is absent in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings indicate that inhomogeneities could significantly affect the 21\,cm signal, and may shed further light on the different measurements of the Hubble constant.

2025-05-28, **Diverse reddening distributions in sight lines to type Ia supernovae**, Lucas Hallgren et.al., [2505.22216v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22216v1)

 Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from host-galaxy interstellar reddening.The latter is commonly modelled in a probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\tau) as a universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies. We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies, primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution may peak at E(B-V)>0 when considering a population of young type Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust expected in these galaxies.

2025-05-28, **The Kick Velocity Distribution of Isolated Neutron Stars**, Paul Disberg et.al., [2505.22102v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22102v1)

 Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to receive natal kicks at their formation in supernovae. In order to investigate the magnitude of these kicks, we analyze the proper motions and distance estimates -- either through parallax or dispersion measures -- of young isolated pulsars and infer their three-dimensional velocities relative to their local standard of rest. We find that the velocities based on parallax distances of pulsars younger than $10$ Myr follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of $\ln\left(v/\text{km}/\text{s}^{-1}\right)=5.60\pm0.12$ and a standard deviation of $0.68\pm0.10$, peaking at ${\sim}150$--$200$ km s$^{-1}$, which we adopt as our fiducial kick distribution. Using a previously established method that infers kick magnitudes through the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories, we also estimate the kick velocities of older pulsars, which we find to be consistent with our fiducial kick distribution. A log-normal fit to all pulsars with ages below $40$ Myr yields a more constraining (but possibly more prone to systematic errors) fit with mean and standard deviation of $5.67\pm0.10$ and $0.59\pm0.08$, respectively. Moreover, we (1) resolve the tension between our results and the Maxwellian distribution found by Hobbs et al. (2005), which has a ${\sim}50\%$ higher median velocity, by showing that their analysis is missing a Jacobian needed to correct for its logarithmic histogram bin sizes, and (2) argue that the bimodality found by others is not statistically significant and that previous results are consistent with our inferred kick distribution, effectively reconciling the literature on observed NS kicks.

2025-05-28, **Cosmic Strings as Dynamical Dark Energy: Novel Constraints**, Hanyu Cheng et.al., [2505.22066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22066v1)

 Cosmic strings, topological defects predicted by high-energy theories, may contribute to the late-time expansion of the Universe, effectively mimicking dynamical dark energy. We investigate four phenomenological extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model involving a residual string network: (i) a non-relativistic component with positive energy density (Model~1), (ii) a velocity-dependent extension (Model~2), (iii) a non-relativistic string network with energy density allowed to take both positive and negative values (Model~3), and (iv) a general scenario with free energy and velocity parameters (Model~4). These models are constrained using \textit{Planck} CMB data, SDSS or DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae observations. Models~1 and~2 yield strong upper bounds on the string density, for example, $\Omega\_{\mathrm{s}} < 0.00901$ at 95\% CL from the CMB+DESI+DESY5 combination for Model~2, and mildly shift the inferred value of $H\_0$ upward, though they are not favored by Bayesian evidence. For the same combination, the bulk velocity is bound as $v\_{\mathrm{s}} < 0.569$. Models~3 and~4 exhibit a consistent preference for slightly negative values of $\Omega\_{\mathrm{s}}$, with CMB-only data yielding $\Omega\_{\mathrm{s}} = -0.038^{+0.029}\_{-0.022}$ and $v\_{\mathrm{s}}< 0.574$ in Model~4, and a best-fit improvement of $\Delta \chi^2 = -6.07$. However, these improvements are not sufficient to overcome the Occam penalty, and the Bayesian evidence continues to favor $\Lambda$CDM. These findings demonstrate the power of current data to constrain exotic energy components and encourage further exploration of string-inspired extensions to $\Lambda$CDM, particularly those involving negative-tension networks.

2025-05-28, **The chemical yields of stars in the range 9-15 Msun**, Marco Limongi et.al., [2505.22030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22030v1)

 In Limongi et al. (2024) we presented and discussed the main evolutionary properties and final fate of stars in the mass range 7-15 Msun. The evolutions of those models were computed by means of a medium size nuclear network that guaranteed a proper calculation of the nuclear energy generation and hence a good modeling of the physical evolution of these stars. In the present paper, we extend this study by computing the detailed chemical yields of stars in the mass range 9-15 Msun, i.e., those stars that explode as core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The explosive nucleosynthesis is then computed in the framework of the thermal bomb induced explosion by means of the HYPERION code (Limongi and Chieffi 2020). We find that: (1) the yields of the intermediate mass elements (i.e., O to P) show a steep decrease as the inital mass decreases; (2) the yields of s-weak component, i.e., those produced by the slow neutron captures from Ga to to the first neutron closure shell, decrease almost linearly as a function of the initial mass with respect to the ones produced by the more massive stars; (3) the global contribution of the stars in the mass range 9.22-13 Msun to the yields of a generation of massive stars averaged over a standard initial mass function is negligible for essentially all the isotopes. In spite of this, however, the models of stars in this mass range can be fundamental to interpret the observations of specific supernovae.
