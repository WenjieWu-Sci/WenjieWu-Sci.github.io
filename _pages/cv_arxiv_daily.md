2023-03-23, **Lindhard integral equation with binding energy applied to light and charge yields of nuclear recoils in noble liquid detectors**, Y. Sarkis et.al., [2303.13441v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13441v1)

 We present a model of the ionization efficiency, or quenching factor, for low-energy nuclear recoils, based on a solution to Lindhard integral equation with binding energy and apply it to the calculation of the relative scintillation efficiency and charge yield for nuclear recoils in noble liquid detectors. The quenching model incorporates a constant average binding energy together with an electronic stopping power proportional to the ion velocity, and is an essential input in an analysis of charge recombination processes to predict the ionization and scintillation yields. Our results are comparable to NEST simulations of LXe and LAr and are in good agreement with available data. These studies are relevant to current and future experiments using noble liquids as targets for neutrino physics and the direct searches for dark matter.

2023-03-23, **CE$ν$NS Experiment Proposal at CSNS**, Chenguang Su et.al., [2303.13423v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13423v1)

 The detection and cross section measurement of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) is vital for particle physics, astrophysics and nuclear physics. Therefore, a new CE$\nu$NS detection experiment is proposed in China. Undoped CsI crystals coupled with two Photon Multiplier Tubes (PMTs) each, will be cooled down to 77K and placed at China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) to detect the CE$\nu$NS signals produced by neutrinos from stopped pion decays happening within the Tungsten target of CSNS. Owing to the extremely high light yield of pure CsI at 77K, even though only having a neutrino flux 60\% weaker than COHERENT, the detectable signal event rate is still expected to be $0.14/day/kg$. Low radioactivity materials and devices will be used to construct the detector and strong shielding will be applied to reduce the radioactive and neutron background. Dual-PMT readout should be able to reject PMT-related background like Cherenkov light and PMT dark noise. With all the strategies above, we are hoping to reach a 5.1$\sigma$ signal detection significance by a half-year data taking with a $12kg$ CsI. In this presentation, the design of the experiment will be presented. In addition, the estimation of signal, various kinds of background and expected signal sensitivity will be discussed.

2023-03-23, **Zee-model predictions for lepton flavor violation**, Julian Heeck et.al., [2303.13383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13383v1)

 The Zee model provides a simple model for one-loop Majorana neutrino masses. The new scalars can furthermore explain the long-standing deviation in the muon's magnetic moment and the recent CDF measurement of the $W$-boson mass. Together, these observations yield predictions for lepton flavor violating processes that are almost entirely testable in the near future. The remaining parameter space makes testable predictions for neutrino masses.

2023-03-23, **Development of proton beam irradiation system for the NA65/DsTau experiment**, Shigeki Aoki et.al., [2303.13070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13070v1)

 Tau neutrino is the least studied lepton of the Standard Model (SM). The NA65/DsTau experiment targets to investigate $D\_s$, the parent particle of the $\nu\_\tau$, using the nuclear emulsion-based detector and to decrease the systematic uncertainty of $\nu\_\tau$ flux prediction from over 50% to 10% for future beam dump experiments. In the experiment, the emulsion detectors are exposed to the CERN SPS 400 GeV proton beam. To provide optimal conditions for the reconstruction of interactions, the protons are required to be uniformly distributed over the detector's surface with an average density of $10^5~\rm{cm^{-2}}$ and the fluctuation of less than 10%. To address this issue, we developed a new proton irradiation system called the target mover. The new target mover provided irradiation with a proton density of $0.98~\rm{cm^{-2}}$ and the density fluctuation of $2.0\pm 0.3$% in the DsTau 2021 run.

2023-03-23, **High-Energy Neutrino Fluxes from Hard-TeV BL Lacs**, E. Aguilar-Ruiz et.al., [2303.13025v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13025v1)

 Blazars have been pointed out as promising high-energy (HE) neutrinos sources, although the mechanism is still under debate. The blazars with a hard-TeV spectrum, which leptonic models can hardly explain, can be successfully interpreted in the hadronic scenarios. Recently, Aguilar et al. proposed a lepto-hadronic two-zone model to explain the multi-wavelength observations of the six best-known extreme BL Lacs and showed that the hadronic component could mainly interpret very-high-energy (VHE) emission. In this work, we apply this hadronic model to describe the VHE gamma-ray fluxes of 14 extreme BL Lacs and estimate the respective HE neutrino flux from charge-pion decay products. Finally, we compare our result with the diffuse flux observed by the IceCube telescope, showing that the neutrino fluxes from these objects are negligible.

2023-03-22, **Resonant neutrino self-interactions and the $H_0$ tension**, Jorge Venzor et.al., [2303.12792v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12792v1)

 In this work, we study the previously unexplored resonant region of neutrino self-interactions. Current disagreement on late and early time observations of the Universe expansion could be solved with new physics acting before the recombination era. Nonstandard neutrino self-interactions are among the most appealing candidates to solve this issue since they could be testable in the near (or middle) future. We use linear cosmological datasets to test neutrino self-interactions for a sample of fixed scalar mediator masses in the range $10^{-2}$ eV $\leq m\_{\varphi}\leq 10^{2}$ eV. The resonant behavior produces observable effects at lower couplings than those reported in the literature for heavy and light mediators. We observe that in the best case scenario, using the Planck + BAO dataset, the tension with local measurements of $H\_0$ eases from 4.9$\sigma$ (for $\Lambda$CDM) down to 2.8$\sigma$. The joint data set which includes Planck, BAO, and $H\_0$ prefers a non-zero interaction with at least 2.3$\sigma$ significance in the range $0.5$ eV $\leq m\_{\varphi}\leq 10$ eV. These results add the last piece in the parameter space of neutrino self-interactions at the linear perturbation regime.

2023-03-22, **All-sky limits on Sterile Neutrino Galactic Dark Matter obtained with SRG/ART-XC after two years of operations**, E. I. Zakharov et.al., [2303.12673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12673v1)

 Dark matter sterile neutrinos radiatively decay in the Milky Way, which can be tested with searches for almost monochromatic photons in the X-ray cosmic spectrum. We analyse the data of ART-XC telescope operated for two years in the all-sky survey mode. With no significant hints in the Galactic diffuse X-ray spectrum we explore models with sterile neutrino masses in 12-40 keV range and exclude corresponding regions of sterile-active neutrino mixing.

2023-03-22, **Nucleosynthesis in jet-driven and jet-associated supernovae**, M. Obergaulinger et.al., [2303.12458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12458v1)

 In contrast to regular core-collapse supernovae, explosions of rapidly rotating massive stars can develop jets, fast collimated outflows directed along the rotational axis. Depending on the rate of rotation and the magnetic field strength before collapse as well as on possible mechanisms amplifying the magnetic field, such a core can explode magnetorotationally rather than via the standard supernova mechanism based on neutrino heating. This scenario can explain the highest kinetic energies observed in the class of hypernovae. On longer time scales, rotation and magnetic fields can play an important role in the engine of long gamma-ray burst powered by proto-magnetars or hyperaccreting black holes in collapsars. Both classes of events are characterized by relativistic jets and winds driven by neutrinos or magnetic spin-down of the central objects. The nucleosynthesis in these events includes the production of Fe group elements, including a possibly enhanced synthesis of radioactive 56Ni leading to high peak luminosities. Additionally, these events are, out of all stellar core-collapse events the ones most likely to allow for the formation of the heaviest nuclei via rapid neutron captures. Increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations indicate that at least a limited r-process is possible, though it remains open how robust this result is against variations in the numerical methods and the initial conditions. If so, supernovae with jets could contribute to the observed galactic chemical enrichment, in particular at early times before neutron-star mergers might be able to set in.

2023-03-22, **Jets from neutron-star merger remnants and massive blue kilonovae**, Luciano Combi et.al., [2303.12284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12284v1)

 We perform high-resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with neutrino transport of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers resulting in a long-lived remnant neutron star, with properties typical of galactic BNS and consistent with those inferred for the first observed BNS merger GW170817. We demonstrate self-consistently that within $\lesssim\!30$ ms post-merger magnetized ($\sigma\sim 5-10$) twin polar jets emerge with asymptotic Lorentz factor $\Gamma\sim 5-10$, which successfully break out from the merger debris within $\lesssim\!20$ ms. A fast ($v\lesssim 0.6c$), magnetized ($\sigma\sim 0.1$) wind surrounds the jet core and generates a UV/blue kilonova precursor on timescales of hours, similar to the precursor signal due to free neutron decay in fast dynamical ejecta. Post-merger ejecta are quickly dominated by MHD-driven outflows from an accretion disk. We demonstrate that within only 50 ms post-merger, $\gtrsim 2\times 10^{-2}M\_\odot$ of lanthanide-free, quasi-spherical ejecta with velocity $\sim\!0.1c$ is launched, yielding a kilonova signal consistent with GW170817 on timescales of $\lesssim\!5$\,d.

2023-03-23, **Flavor Probes of Axion Dark Matter**, Robert Ziegler et.al., [2303.13353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13353v1)

 Standard Model extensions with light axions are well-motivated by the observed Dark Matter abundance and the Peccei-Quinn solution to the Strong CP Problem. In general such axions can have large flavor-violating couplings to SM fermions, which naturally arise in scenarios where the Peccei-Quinn symmetry also explains the hierarchical pattern of fermion masses and mixings. I will discuss how these couplings allow for efficient axion production from the decays of SM particles, giving the opportunity to probe flavored axion Dark Matter with precision flavor experiments, astrophysics and cosmology.

2023-03-23, **On the origin of extreme trans-Neptunian objects within Modified Newtonian Dynamics**, Cezary Migaszewski et.al., [2303.13339v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13339v1)

 In this work, we investigate the dynamical origin of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) under the action of the External Field Effect (EFE), which is a consequence of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) applied to gravity around the Sun embedded in the gravitational field of the Galaxy. We perform N-body integrations of known ETNOs treated as massless particles and perturbed by four giant planets and EFE. Backward integrations show that these objects originated in the giant planet region, from where they were scattered and then evolved to their current orbits. A striking example of such evolution is Sedna, which may have been temporarily in a horseshoe orbit with Jupiter and Saturn only $30$~Myr ago. Another interesting example is the newly discovered retrograde ETNOs, whose dynamical connection with prograde ETNOs and Centaurs is shown. The EFE is considered as an alternative to Planet Nine in explaining the anomalous distribution of ETNO orbits, namely the orbital plane clustering and apsidal confinement. We also analyse the effect of MOND on the obliquity of the solar spin with respect to the invariant plane of the solar system. Finally, we discuss the significance of trans-Neptunian solar system in the context of the dark matter hypothesis.

2023-03-23, **Prospective Dark Matter Annihilation Signals From the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal**, Thomas A. A. Venville et.al., [2303.13180v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13180v1)

 The Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) is investigated as a target for DM annihilation searches utilizing J-factor distributions calculated directly from a high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the infall and tidal disruption of Sgr around the Milky Way. In contrast to past studies, the simulation incorporates DM, stellar and gaseous components for both the Milky Way and the Sgr progenitor galaxy. The simulated distributions account for significant tidal disruption affecting the DM density profile. Our estimate of the J-factor value for Sgr, $J\_{\text{Sgr}}=1.48\times 10^{10}\ \text{M}^2\_\odot\ \text{kpc}^{-5}$ ($6.46\times10^{16}\ \text{GeV}\ \text{cm}^{-5}$), is significantly lower than found in prior studies. This value, while formally a lower limit, is likely close to the true J-factor value for Sgr. It implies a DM cross-section incompatibly large in comparison with existing constraints would be required to attribute recently observed $\gamma$-ray emission from Sgr (Crocker, Macias et al. 2022; arXiv:2204.12054) to DM annihilation. We also calculate a J-factor value using an NFW profile fitted to the simulated DM density distribution to facilitate comparison with past studies. This NFW J-factor value supports the conclusion that most past studies have overestimated the dark matter density of Sgr on small scales. This, together with the fact that the Sgr has recently been shown to emit $\gamma$-rays of astrophysical origin, complicate the use of Sgr in indirect DM detection searches.

2023-03-23, **Upper limit on scalar field dark matter from LIGO-Virgo third observation run**, Koki Fukusumi et.al., [2303.13088v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13088v1)

 If dark matter is a light scalar field weakly interacting with elementary particles, such a field induces oscillations of the physical constants, which results in time-varying force acting on macroscopic objects. In this paper, we report on a search for such a signal in the data of the two LIGO detectors during their third observing run (O3). We focus on the mass of the scalar field in the range of $10^{-13}-10^{-11}~{\rm eV}$ for which the signal falls within the detectors' sensitivity band. We first formulate the cross-correlation statistics that can be readily compared with publically available data. It is found that inclusion of the anisotropies of the velocity distribution of dark matter caused by the motion of the solar system in the Milky Way Galaxy enhances the signal by a factor of $\sim 2$ except for the narrow mass range around $\simeq 3\times 10^{-13}~{\rm eV}$ for which the correlation between the interferometer at Livingston and the one at Hanford is suppressed. From the non-detection of the signal, we derive the upper limits on the coupling constants between the elementary particles and the scalar field for five representative cases. For all the cases where the weak equivalence principle is not satisfied, tests of the violation of the weak equivalence principle provide the tightest upper limit on the coupling constants. Upper limits from the fifth-force experiment are always stronger than the ones from LIGO, but the difference is less than a factor of $\sim 5$ at large-mass range. Our study demonstrates that gravitational-wave experiments are starting to bring us meaningful information about the nature of dark matter. The formulation provided in this paper may be applied to the data of upcoming experiments as well and is expected to probe much wider parameter range of the model.

2023-03-23, **Lepton Flavor Portal Matter**, George N. Wojcik et.al., [2303.12983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12983v1)

 The paradigm of portal matter represents a well-motivated extension to models with kinetic mixing/vector portal dark matter. In previous work, we constructed a simple leptonic portal matter model in which the portal matter fields could mediate a new physics correction to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon consistent with the observed discrepancy between the measured value for this quantity and the SM prediction. Here, we present a version of this mechanism by constructing a model with an extended dark gauge sector in which SM and portal matter fields exist as members of the same dark gauge multiplets, which provides a natural extension of simple portal matter models. We find a rich phenomenology in this extended model, including nontrivial novel characteristics that do not appear in our earlier minimal construction, and discuss current experimental constraints and future prospects for this model. We find that a multi-TeV muon collider has excellent prospects for constraining or measuring the crucial parameters of this model.

2023-03-22, **Gravitational waves from an eccentric population of primordial black holes orbiting Sgr A$^{\star}$**, Stefano Bondani et.al., [2303.12868v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12868v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBH), supposedly formed in the very early Universe, have been proposed as a possible viable dark matter candidate. In this work we characterize the expected gravitational wave (GW) losses from a population of PBHs orbiting Sgr A$^{\star}$, the super-massive black hole at the Galactic center, and assess the signal detectability by the planned space-borne interferometer LISA and by the proposed next generation space-borne interferometer $\mu$Ares. Assuming that PBHs indeed form the entire diffuse mass allowed to reside within the orbit of the S2 star, we compute an upper limit to the expected GW signal both from resolved and non-resolved sources, under the further assumptions of monochromatic mass function and thermally distributed eccentricities. By comparing with our previous work where PBHs on circular orbits were assumed, we show how the GW signal from high harmonics over a 10 year data stream increases by a factor of six the chances of LISA detectability, from the $\approx 10\%$ of the circular case, to $\approx 60\%$, whereas multiple sources can be identified in $20\%$ of our mock populations. The background signal, made by summing up all non resolved sources, should be detectable thanks to the PBHs with higher eccentricity evolving under two body relaxation. In the case of $\mu$Ares, because of its improved sensitivity in the $\mu$Hz band, one third of the entire population of PBHs orbiting Sgr A$^{\star}$ would be resolved. The background noise from the remaining non resolved sources should be detectable as well.

2023-03-22, **A test of invariance of dark matter halo surface density using multiwavelength mock galaxy catalogues**, Gopika K. et.al., [2303.12859v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12859v1)

 A large number of observations have shown that the dark matter halo surface density, given by the product of halo core radius and core density is nearly constant for a diverse suite of galaxies. Although this invariance of the halo surface density is violated at galaxy cluster and group scales, it is still an open question on whether the aforementioned constancy on galactic scales can be explained within $\Lambda$CDM. For this purpose, we probe the variation of halo surface density as a function of mass using multi-wavelength mock galaxy catalogs from $\Lambda$CDM simulations, where the adiabatic contraction of dark matter halos in the presence of baryons has been taken into account. We find that these baryonified $\Lambda$CDM halos were best fitted with a generalized-NFW profile, and the halo surface density from these halos has a degeneracy with respect to both the halo mass and the virial concentration. We find that the correlation with mass when averaged over concentration is consistent with a constant halo surface density. However, a power-law dependence as a function of halo mass also cannot be ruled out.

2023-03-22, **Search for the evaporation of primordial black holes with H.E.S.S**, H. E. S. S. collaboration et.al., [2303.12855v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12855v1)

 Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes predicted to have been formed from density fluctuations in the early Universe. PBHs with an initial mass around $10^{14}-10^{15}$g are expected to end their evaporation at present times in a burst of particles and very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays. Those gamma rays may be detectable by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), an array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. This paper reports on the search for evaporation bursts of VHE gamma rays with H.E.S.S., ranging from 10 to 120 seconds, as expected from the final stage of PBH evaporation and using a total of 4816 hours of observations. The most constraining upper limit on the burst rate of local PBHs is $2000$ pc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for a burst interval of 120 seconds, at the 95\% confidence level. The implication of these measurements for PBH dark matter are also discussed.

2023-03-22, **Evolution of binary stars in the early evolutionary phases of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies**, Alexander R. Livernois et.al., [2303.12841v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12841v1)

 The dynamics of binary stars provides a unique avenue to gather insight into the study of the structure and dynamics of star clusters and galaxies. In this paper, we present the results of a set of $N$-body simulations aimed at exploring the evolution of binary stars during the early evolutionary phases of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFD). In our simulations, we assume that the stellar component of the UFD is initially dynamically cold and evolves towards its final equilibrium after undergoing the violent relaxation phase. We show that the early evolutionary phases of the UFD significantly enhance the disruption of wide binaries and leave their dynamical fingerprints on the semi-major axis distribution of the surviving binaries as compared to models initially in equilibrium. An initially thermal eccentricity distribution is preserved except for the widest binaries for which it evolves towards a superthermal distribution; for a binary population with an initially uniform eccentricity distribution, memory of this initial distribution is rapidly lost for most binaries as wider binaries evolve to approach a thermal/superthermal distribution. The evolution of binaries is driven both by tidal effects due to the potential of the UFD dark matter halo and collisional effects associated to binary-binary/single star encounters. Collisional effects are particularly important within the clumpy substructure characterizing the system during its early evolution; in addition to enhancing binary ionization and evolution of the binary orbital parameters, encounters may lead to exchanges of either of the primordial binary components with one of the interacting stars.

2023-03-22, **The dark matter profile of the Milky Way inferred from its circular velocity curve**, Xiaowei Ou et.al., [2303.12838v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12838v1)

 All galaxies are formed within dark matter halos, the nature of which is yet to be understood. The circular velocity curve, one of the first pieces of evidence for dark matter, is a direct probe of the Galaxy's potential, which allows studies of the nature of these dark matter halos. Recent large surveys have provided valuable information for determining the Milky Way circular velocity curve. In this study, we derive precise parallaxes for 120,309 stars with a data-driven model, using APOGEE DR17 spectra combined with photometry measurements from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE. We measure the circular velocity curve of the Milky Way out to $\sim 30$ kpc, and use it to provide an updated model of the dark matter density profile. We find a significantly faster decline in the circular velocity curve at outer galactic radii. To address this decline, we find that a cored Einasto profile with slope parameter $1.13^{+0.06}\_{-0.06}$ is a better fit to the data than a generalized or contracted Navarro-Frank-White (NFW), as was argued in previous studies. The virial mass of the best-fit dark matter halo is $1.50^{+0.04}\_{-0.04}\times10^{11}$ $M\_{\odot}$, significantly lower than that from a generalized NFW profile, but the corresponding local dark matter density at the solar position is $0.425^{+0.004}\_{-0.004}$ GeV cm$^{-3}$, consistent with the literature. We additionally find the $J$-factor for annihilating dark matter at a 15$^{\circ}$ view angle towards the galactic centre is $9.96^{+0.64}\_{-0.57}\times10^{22}$ GeV$^{2}$ cm$^{-5}$, $\sim 8\%$ of the value found from a standard NFW profile used in the literature. Our results further demonstrate the capability of the circular velocity curve, especially in light of the recent wave of data, in constraining the Milky Way's dark matter halo.

2023-03-22, **Inhomogeneous Galactic Chemical Evolution: Modelling Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies of the Large Magellanic Cloud**, Ryan K. Alexander et.al., [2303.12530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12530v1)

 Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are among the oldest and most metal-poor galaxies in the cosmos, observed to contain no traces of gas at the present time and a high dark matter mass fraction. Understanding the chemical abundance dispersion in such extreme environments could shed light on the properties of the first generations of stars in the cosmos. We present a novel inhomogeneous chemical evolution model, i-GEtool, that we apply to two ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, Carina II (Car II) and Reticulum II (Ret II), which are satellites of the Large Magellanic Cloud. In summary, our model is based on the Monte Carlo sampling of the initial mass function as star formation proceeds in different gas cells of the simulated galaxy volume. We account for the chemical enrichment of Supernova bubbles as they spread in the interstellar medium, which causes dispersion in the predicted elemental abundances. We recreate the elemental abundance patterns by focusing on $\alpha$- and odd-$\textit{Z}$ elements, predicting two sequences in [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] at all metallicities. Our models systematically underestimate [C/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] because of the large uncertainty in the adopted stellar nucleosynthesis yields. We discuss that the observed C and N abundances had likely been affected by internal mixing processes, which changed the initial surface abundances in the red giants. Our Supernova feedback scheme is responsible for driving galactic outflows, which quench the star formation activity in the simulated galaxies at early times. The average outflow mass-loading factor as predicted by our models is $\approx 10^{3}$, which extrapolates towards very low galaxy stellar masses the trend observed at high stellar masses. Finally, by combining our model with the MIST isochrone database, we draw synthetic colour-magnitude diagrams of Car II and Ret II and compare them to observations.

2023-03-23, **A helium-burning white dwarf binary as a supersoft X-ray source**, J. Greiner et.al., [2303.13338v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13338v1)

 Type Ia supernovae are cosmic distance indicators, and the main source of iron in the Universe, but their formation paths are still debated. Several dozen supersoft X-ray sources, in which a white dwarf accretes hydrogen-rich matter from a non-degenerate donor star, have been observed and suggested as Type Ia supernovae progenitors. However, observational evidence for hydrogen, which is expected to be stripped off the donor star during the supernova explosion, is lacking. Helium-accreting white dwarfs, which would circumvent this problem, have been predicted for more than 30 years, also including their appearance as supersoft X-ray sources, but have so far escaped detection. Here we report a supersoft X-ray source with an accretion disk whose optical spectrum is completely dominated by helium, suggesting that the donor star is hydrogen-free. We interpret the luminous and supersoft X-rays as due to helium burning near the surface of the accreting white dwarf. The properties of our system provides evidence for extended pathways towards Chandrasekhar mass explosions based on helium accretion, in particular for stable burning in white dwarfs at lower accretion rates than expected so far. This may allow to recover the population of the sub-energetic so-called Type Iax supernovae, up to 30% of all Type Ia supernovae, within this scenario.

2023-03-22, **GRB 191019A: a short gamma-ray burst in disguise from the disk of an active galactic nucleus**, Davide Lazzati et.al., [2303.12935v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12935v1)

 Long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), canonically separated at around 2 seconds duration, are associated with different progenitors: the collapse of a massive star and the merger of two compact objects, respectively. GRB 191019A was a long GRB ($T\_{90}\sim64$ s). Despite the relatively small redshift z=0.248 and HST followup observations, an accompanying supernova was not detected. In addition, the host galaxy did not have significant star formation activity. Here we propose that GRB 191019A was produced by a binary compact merger, whose prompt emission was stretched in time by the interaction with a dense external medium. This would be expected if the burst progenitor was located in the disk of an active galactic nucleus, as supported by the burst localization close to the center of its host galaxy. We show that the light curve of GRB 191019A can be well modeled by a burst of intrinsic duration t=1.1 s and of energy $E\_{\rm{iso}}=10^{51}$ erg seen moderately off-axis, exploding in a medium of density $10^7-10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The double-peaked light curve carries the telltale features predicted for GRBs in high-density media, where the first peak is produced by the photosphere, and the second by the overlap of reverse shocks that take place before the internal shocks could happen. This would make GRB 191019A the first confirmed stellar explosion from within an accretion disk, with important implications for the formation and evolution of stars in accretion flows and for gravitational waves source populations.

2023-03-22, **A long-duration gamma-ray burst of dynamical origin from the nucleus of an ancient galaxy**, Andrew J. Levan et.al., [2303.12912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12912v1)

 The majority of long duration ($>2$ s) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to arise from the collapse of massive stars \cite{Hjorth+03}, with a small proportion created from the merger of compact objects. Most of these systems are likely formed via standard stellar evolution pathways. However, it has long been thought that a fraction of GRBs may instead be an outcome of dynamical interactions in dense environments, channels which could also contribute significantly to the samples of compact object mergers detected as gravitational wave sources. Here we report the case of GRB 191019A, a long GRB (T\_90 = 64.4 +/- 4.5 s) which we pinpoint close (<100 pc projected) to the nucleus of an ancient (>1~Gyr old) host galaxy at z=0.248. The lack of evidence for star formation and deep limits on any supernova emission make a massive star origin difficult to reconcile with observations, while the timescales of the emission rule out a direct interaction with the supermassive black hole in the nucleus of the galaxy, We suggest that the most likely route for progenitor formation is via dynamical interactions in the dense nucleus of the host, consistent with the centres of such galaxies exhibiting interaction rates up to two orders of magnitude larger than typical field galaxies. The burst properties could naturally be explained via compact object mergers involving white dwarfs (WD), neutron stars (NS) or black holes (BH). These may form dynamically in dense stellar clusters, or originate in a gaseous disc around the supermassive black hole. Future electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations in tandem thus offer a route to probe the dynamical fraction and the details of dynamical interactions in galactic nuclei and other high density stellar systems.

 We report observations of the optical counterpart of the long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) GRB 221009A. Due to the extreme rarity of being both nearby ($z = 0.151$) and highly energetic ($E\_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso}} \geq 10^{54}$ erg), GRB 221009A offers a unique opportunity to probe the connection between massive star core collapse and relativistic jet formation. Adopting a phenomenological power-law model for the afterglow and host galaxy estimates from high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we use Bayesian model comparison techniques to determine the likelihood of an associated SN contributing excess flux to the optical light curve. Though not conclusive, we find moderate evidence ($K\_{\rm{Bayes}}=10^{1.2}$) for the presence of an additional component arising from an associated supernova, SN 2022xiw, and find that it must be substantially fainter than SN 1998bw. Given the large and uncertain line-of-sight extinction, we attempt to constrain the supernova parameters ($M\_{\mathrm{Ni}}$, $M\_{\mathrm{ej}}$, and $E\_{\mathrm{KE}}$) under several different assumptions with respect to the host galaxy's extinction. We find properties that are broadly consistent with previous GRB-associated SNe: $M\_{\rm{Ni}}=0.05$ - $0.25 \rm{M\_\odot}$, $M\_{\rm{ej}}=3.5$ - $11.1 \rm{M\_\odot}$, and $E\_{\rm{KE}} = (1.6$ - $5.2) \times 10^{52} \rm{erg}$. We note that these properties are weakly constrained due to the faintness of the supernova with respect to the afterglow and host emission, but we do find a robust upper limit on the Nickel mass of $M\_{\rm{Ni}}<0.36$ $\rm{M\_\odot}$. Given the tremendous range in isotropic gamma-ray energy release exhibited by GRBs (7 orders of magnitude), the SN emission appears to be decoupled from the central engine in these systems.

2023-03-22, **SRG/eROSITA and XMM-Newton observations of Vela Jr**, Francesco Camilloni et.al., [2303.12686v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12686v1)

 The Vela supernova remnant complex is a region containing at least three supernova remnants: Vela, Puppis A, and Vela Jr. With the launch of the spectro-imaging X-ray telescope eROSITA on board the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) mission, it became possible to observe the one degree wide Vela Jr in its entirety. Although several previous pointed Chandra and XMM-Newton observations are available, it is only the second time after the ROSAT all-sky survey that the whole remnant was observed in X-rays with homogeneous sensitivity. Vela Jr is one of the few remnants emitting in the TeV band, making it an important object in shock acceleration studies. However, the age and distance determination using X-ray emission is largely hampered by the presence of the Vela SNR along the same line. With the eROSITA data set our aim is to characterize the emission of Vela Jr and distinguish it from Vela emission, and also to characterize the spectral emission of the inner remnant. We processed the eROSITA data dividing the whole remnant into seven different regions. In addition, images of the whole remnant were employed to pinpoint the position of the geometric center and constrain the proper motion of the CCO. We also employed archival XMM-Newton pointed observations of the NW rim to determine the cutoff energy of the electrons and the expansion velocity. We find the magnetic field can vary between 2 $\mu$G and 16 $\mu$G in the NW rim. We also find that the remnant spectrum is uniformly featureless in most regions, except for two inner regions where an extra thermal model component improves the fit. We obtain new coordinates for the geometric remnant center, resulting in a separation of only 35.2 $\pm$ 15.8" from the position of the CCO. As a result, we reinforce the association between the CCO and a proposed faint optical/IR counterpart.

2023-03-22, **Constraining f(Q) Cosmology with Standard Sirens**, José Ferreira et.al., [2303.12674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12674v1)

 In this dissertation, we study two cosmological models based on $f(Q)$ gravity. We resort to mock catalogs of standard siren (SS) events to see whether data from future gravitational wave (GWs) observatories will be able to distinguish these models from $\Lambda$CDM.   The first model is the most general $f(Q)$ formulation that replicates a $\Lambda$CDM background, with deviations appearing only at the perturbative level. It has one additional free parameter compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\alpha$, which when set to zero falls back to $\Lambda$CDM. We show that LIGO-Virgo is unable to constrain $\alpha$, due to the high error and low redshift of the measurements, whereas LISA and the ET will, with the ET outperforming LISA. The catalogs for both LISA and LIGO-Virgo show non-negligible statistical fluctuations, where we consider three representative catalogs (the best, median and worst), whereas for the ET, only a single catalog is considered, as the number of events is large enough for statistical fluctuations to be neglected. The best LISA catalog is the one with more low redshift events, while the worst LISA catalog features fewer low redshift events. Additionally, if we are to observe a bad LISA catalog, we can rely on data from LIGO-Virgo to improve the quality of the constrains, bringing it closer to a median LISA catalog.   The second model attempts to replace dark energy by making use of a specific form of the function $f(Q)$. We study this model resorting to dynamical system techniques to show the regions in parameter space with viable cosmologies. Using model selection criteria, we show that no number of SS events is, by itself, able to tell this model and $\Lambda$CDM apart. We then show that if we add current type Ia Supernova (SnIa) data, tensions in this model arise when compared to the constrains set by the SS events.

2023-03-22, **The orbital and physical properties of five southern Be+sdO binary systems**, Luqian Wang et.al., [2303.12616v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12616v1)

 Close binary interactions may play a critical role in the formation of the rapidly rotating Be stars. Mass transfer can result in a mass gainer star spun up by the accretion of mass and angular momentum, while the mass donor is stripped of its envelope to form a hot and faint helium star. FUV spectroscopy has led to the detection of about 20 such binary Be+sdO systems. Here we report on a three-year program of high quality spectroscopy designed to determine the orbital periods and physical properties of five Be binary systems. These binaries are long orbital period systems with $P =$ 95 to 237 days and with small semi-amplitude $K\_1<11$ km s$^{-1}$. We combined the Be star velocities with prior sdO measurements to obtain mass ratios. A Doppler tomography algorithm shows the presence of the He II $\lambda 4686$ line in the faint spectrum of the hot companion in four of the targets. We discuss the observed line variability and show evidence of phased-locked variations in the emission profiles of HD 157832, suggesting a possible disk spiral density wave due to the presence of the companion star. The stripped companions in HD 113120 and HD 137387 may have a mass larger than the 1.4 $M\_\odot$ indicating that they could be progenitors of Type Ib and Ic supernovae.

2023-03-22, **Mixing of materials in magnetised core-collapse supernova remnants**, Meyer D. M. -A. et.al., [2303.12579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12579v1)

 Core-collapse supernova remnants are structures of the interstellar medium (ISM) left behind the explosive death of most massive stars (smaller or equal to 40 Mo). Since they result in the expansion of the supernova shock wave into the gaseous environment shaped by the star wind history, their morphology constitutes an insight into the past evolution of their progenitor star. Particularly, fast-moving massive stars can produce asymmetric core-collapse supernova remnants. We investigate the mixing of materials in core-collapse supernova remnants generated by a moving massive 35 Mo star, in a magnetised ISM. Stellar rotation and the wind magnetic field are time-dependently included into the models which follow the entire evolution of the stellar surroundings from the zero age main sequence to 80 kyr after the supernova explosion. It is found that very little main sequence material is present in remnants from moving stars, that the Wolf-Rayet wind mixes very efficiently within the 10 kyr after the explosion, while the red supergiant material is still unmixed by 30 per cent within 50 kyr after the supernova. Our results indicate that the faster the stellar motion, the more complex the internal organisation of the supernova remnant and the more effective the mixing of ejecta therein. In contrast, the mixing of stellar wind material is only weakly affected by progenitor motion, if at all.

2023-03-22, **Inhomogeneous Galactic Chemical Evolution: Modelling Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies of the Large Magellanic Cloud**, Ryan K. Alexander et.al., [2303.12530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12530v1)

 Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are among the oldest and most metal-poor galaxies in the cosmos, observed to contain no traces of gas at the present time and a high dark matter mass fraction. Understanding the chemical abundance dispersion in such extreme environments could shed light on the properties of the first generations of stars in the cosmos. We present a novel inhomogeneous chemical evolution model, i-GEtool, that we apply to two ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, Carina II (Car II) and Reticulum II (Ret II), which are satellites of the Large Magellanic Cloud. In summary, our model is based on the Monte Carlo sampling of the initial mass function as star formation proceeds in different gas cells of the simulated galaxy volume. We account for the chemical enrichment of Supernova bubbles as they spread in the interstellar medium, which causes dispersion in the predicted elemental abundances. We recreate the elemental abundance patterns by focusing on $\alpha$- and odd-$\textit{Z}$ elements, predicting two sequences in [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] at all metallicities. Our models systematically underestimate [C/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] because of the large uncertainty in the adopted stellar nucleosynthesis yields. We discuss that the observed C and N abundances had likely been affected by internal mixing processes, which changed the initial surface abundances in the red giants. Our Supernova feedback scheme is responsible for driving galactic outflows, which quench the star formation activity in the simulated galaxies at early times. The average outflow mass-loading factor as predicted by our models is $\approx 10^{3}$, which extrapolates towards very low galaxy stellar masses the trend observed at high stellar masses. Finally, by combining our model with the MIST isochrone database, we draw synthetic colour-magnitude diagrams of Car II and Ret II and compare them to observations.

2023-03-22, **The first stars: formation, properties, and impact**, Ralf S. Klessen et.al., [2303.12500v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12500v1)

 The first generation of stars, often called Population III (or Pop III), form from metal-free primordial gas at redshifts 30 and below. They dominate the cosmic star formation history until redshifts 15 to 20, at which point the formation of metal-enriched Pop II stars takes over. We review current theoretical models for the formation, properties and impact of Pop III stars, and discuss existing and future observational constraints. Key takeaways from this review include the following: (1) Primordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation and Pop III stars form as members of small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function. (2) Feedback from massive Pop III stars plays a central role in regulating subsequent star formation, but major uncertainties remain regarding its immediate impact. (3) In extreme conditions, supermassive Pop III stars can form, reaching masses of several 10^5 Msun. Their remnants may be the seeds of the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars. (4) Direct observations of Pop III stars in the early Universe remain extremely challenging. Indirect constraints from the global 21cm signal or gravitational waves are more promising. (5) Stellar archeological surveys allow us to constrain both the low-mass and the high-mass ends of the Pop III mass distribution. Observations suggest that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than as pair-instability supernovae.

2023-03-22, **Vela pulsar wind nebula x-rays are polarized to near the synchrotron limit**, Fei Xie et.al., [2303.12437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12437v1)

 Pulsar wind nebulae are formed when outflows of relativistic electrons and positrons hit the surrounding supernova remnant or interstellar medium at a shock front. The Vela pulsar wind nebula is powered by a young pulsar (B0833-45, age 11 kyr) and located inside an extended structure called Vela X, itself inside the supernova remnant. Previous X-ray observations revealed two prominent arcs, bisected by a jet and counter jet. Radio maps have shown high linear polarization of 60 per cent in the outer regions of the nebula. Here we report X-ray observation of the inner part of the nebula, where polarization can exceed 60 per cent at the leading edge, which approaches the theoretical limit of what can be produced by synchrotron emission. We infer that, in contrast with the case of the supernova remnant, the electrons in the pulsar wind nebula are accelerated with little or no turbulence in a highly uniform magnetic field.

2023-03-22, **Inferring the progenitor mass-kinetic energy relation of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae from nebular spectroscopy**, Qiliang Fang et.al., [2303.12432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12432v1)

 The relation between the progenitor mass and the kinetic energy of the explosion is a key toward revealing the explosion mechanism of stripped-envelope (SE) core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe). Here, we present a method to derive this relation using the nebular spectra of SESNe, based on the correlation between the [O~I]/[Ca~II], which is an indicator of the progenitor mass, and the width of [O~I], which measures the expansion velocity of the oxygen-rich material. To explain the correlation, the kinetic energy ($E\_{\rm K}$) is required to be positively correlated with the progenitor mass as represented by the CO core mass ($M\_{\rm CO}$). We demonstrate that SNe IIb/Ib and SNe Ic/Ic-BL follow the same $M\_{\rm CO}$-$E\_{\rm K}$ scaling relation, which suggests the helium-rich and helium-deficient SNe share the same explosion mechanism. The $M\_{\rm CO}$-$E\_{\rm K}$ relation derived in this work is compared with the ones from early phase observations. The results are largely in good agreement. Combined with early phase observation, the method presented in this work provides a chance to scan through the ejecta from the outermost region to the dense inner core, which is important to reveal the global properties of the ejecta and constrain the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.
