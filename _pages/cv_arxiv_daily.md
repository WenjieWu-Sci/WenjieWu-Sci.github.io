2025-06-26, **3C 403: a candidate neutrino-emitting radio galaxy**, Gabriele Bruni et.al., [2506.21403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21403v1)

 3C 403 is a well known FRII radio galaxy, whose jets extend up to the kpc scale. In this letter, we present its identification as the second most significant source among the more than 150 inspected using the 15-year neutrino dataset of the ANTARES Collaboration, possibly making it the first radio galaxy with neutrino emission. Following the previous association of blazars with netrinos events, we aimed at studying the jet properties and its possible role in neutrino production. We collected multi-scale radio observations to assess the properties of the jet from the kpc to pc scale. Moreover, the high-energy properties of its AGN were inspected. Through the analysis of the jet orientation on the different scales, we verified that neither the inner nor the extended jet seems to have a viewing angle close to the line of sight. Instead, the jet seems to lie on the plane of the sky. In addition, we tested the recently proposed scaling relation between neutrino and hard X-rays fluxes, identified for blazars and Seyfert galaxies, against the measured fluxes for 3C 304. We found that the source lies in the region between blazars and Seyferts, altough the current upper limit on neutrino flux does not allow us to be conclusive on the correlation. In these regards, 3C 403 is an intermediate case between the previous cases of neutrino associations, providing a useful test case for future models.

2025-06-26, **Proto-neutron Stars with Dark Matter Admixture: A Single-Fluid Approach**, Adamu Issifu et.al., [2506.21378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21378v1)

 This work investigates the impact of dark matter (DM) on the microscopic and macroscopic properties of proto-neutron stars (PNSs). We employ a single-fluid framework in which DM interacts with ordinary matter (OM) via the Higgs portal and remains in thermal equilibrium through non-gravitational interactions. Using a quasi-static approximation, we analyze the evolution of PNSs during the Kelvin--Helmholtz phase by varying the DM mass while keeping the entropy per baryon and lepton fraction fixed. Our results show that DM absorbs thermal energy from the stellar medium without efficient re-emission, thereby altering neutrino emission and affecting the star's thermal evolution history. Furthermore, neutrinos contribute significantly to pressure support in the PNS phase, inhibiting DM mass accretion during neutrino-trapped stages. Based on the requirement to satisfy the observed $2\,\rm M\_\odot$ neutron star mass constraint and to maintain consistency with supernova remnant data, we suggest an upper limit of $m\_\chi \leq 0.62\,\rm GeV$ for the DM mass that can accrete in evolving PNSs. In contrast, we established that cold neutron stars (NSs) can support higher DM masses without compromising equilibrium stability, owing to increased central density, enhanced gravitational binding energy, and reduced thermal pressure.

2025-06-26, **JUNO 20-inch PMT and electronics system characterization using large pulses of PMT dark counts at the Pan-Asia testing platform**, Caimei Liu et.al., [2506.21179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21179v1)

 The main goal of the JUNO experiment is to determine the neutrino mass ordering with a 20kt liquid-scintillator detector. The 20-inch PMT and its 1F3 (one for three) electronics are crucial to realize the excellent energy resolution of at least 3% at 1MeV. The knowledge on the PMT and 1F3 electronics response is critical for detector performance understanding. A study of the JUNO 20-inch PMT and 1F3 electronics system characterization is presented using large pulses of PMT dark count at the Pan-Asia testing platform in China. Thanks to its broad amplitude range and high rate, the large pulse signals are also used to investigate the PMT after pulse response.

2025-06-26, **An Accretion Flare Interpretation for the UHE Neutrino Event KM3-230213A**, Chengchao Yuan et.al., [2506.21111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21111v1)

 We study the origin of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) astrophysical neutrino event KM3-230213A detected by KM3NeT, focusing on MRC 0614-083 which has been pinpointed as the closest blazar to the neutrino localization. A joint interpretation of the optical, infrared, and X-ray light curves suggests that MRC 0614-083 has undergone a super-Eddington accretion flare accompanied by efficient proton acceleration. That flare has initiated a delayed infrared echo within the surrounding dust torus, which serves as a target for photomeson ($p\gamma$) interactions such that a self-consistent picture emerges: the predicted UHE neutrino flux is at the level expected from joint $E^{-2}$ fit with the IceCube measurements at lower energies, the variable nature of the event alleviates the tension with IceCube limits, and the accompanying electromagnetic cascade describes the X-ray flare around the neutrino detection time. Since a key remaining uncertainty is the unknown redshift of the source, we strongly encourage optical/ultraviolet spectroscopic measurements to determine its redshift.

2025-06-26, **The Kaleidoscope Survey: Strong Gravitational Lensing in Galaxy Clusters with Radial Arcs**, Catherine Cerny et.al., [2506.21531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21531v1)

 We measure the dark matter density profiles of six galaxy clusters: A383, MS 2137-23, MACS J0326.8-0043, MACS J1427.6-2521, MACS J0417.5-1154, and MACS J0949.8+1708. Each cluster contains at least one radial arc, a unique physical feature that allows for more precise measurements of the inner mass profile (R < 50 kpc) from strong lensing. We present the first strong lensing analysis for MACS J0326 and MACS J1427. We use a combination of HST imaging and VLT/MUSE observations from the ESO Kaleidoscope Clusters Survey, a large `filler' program, to identify and measure redshifts for multiply-imaged systems and obtain the 2-D stellar velocity dispersion for each centrally-located brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). The BCG kinematics are used to subtract the baryonic mass component from the inner mass profile. We find total mass density profiles consistent with previous works using a combination of strong lensing and BCG kinematics. The overall shape of these profiles appears core-like, with an average dark matter slope measurement of $\gamma$~0.66. These results demonstrate the ongoing need for the construction of observational models for galaxy clusters, and show how galaxy-scale kinematics can be used to disentangle baryonic and dark matter concentrations in cluster cores.

2025-06-26, **Quasar cosmology II: joint analyses with Cosmic Microwave Background**, M. Benetti et.al., [2506.21477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21477v1)

 Currently, the increasing availability of accurate cosmological probes leads to the emergence of tensions between data on the one hand and between theoretical predictions and direct observations on the other. Moreover, after 25 years since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has elected the $\Lambda$CDM model as the reference model, resolving shortcomings of the standard cosmological model seems to be an unpostponed priority. Hence, it is key to test alternative models and investigate new cosmological probes at distances that range from the late to the early Universe, namely between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) data. Bargiacchi et al. (2022) for the first time analysed dark energy (DE) models using quasars (QSOs) while also testing their consistency with BAO. Here, we carry on by exploring the compatibility of QSOs with both CMB data and dark energy survey measurements against the standard cosmological model and some DE extensions, such as the $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisations. We also consider an interacting dark matter and vacuum energy scenario, where vacuum energy perturbations affect the evolution of the matter growth rate in a decomposed Chaplygin gas model. We implement the QSO probe in Cobaya Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, using Botzmann solver codes as Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) for the theory predictions. Our work shows that simple DE deviations from $\Lambda$CDM model do not reconcile the data and that only more complex models of interaction in the dark sector can succeed in solving the discrepancies of probes at all scales.

2025-06-26, **Constraint on Momentum-coupled Dark Energy using DESI DR2**, Prasanta Sahoo et.al., [2506.21295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21295v1)

 In this work, we study two scalar field driven dark energy models characterized by the axion potential and the inverse power law potential, each coupled to dark matter through a momentum exchange interaction. By formulating the dynamics as an autonomous system, we identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. To constrain these models, we utilize observational data from Pantheon Plus Type Ia Supernovae, DES Y5, DESI DR2 BAO, and Planck 2018 CMB compressed likelihood, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both potentials exhibit weak to strong preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a particularly strong preference for the momentum-coupled scenario when Supernova data are included in the analysis. Furthermore, we find the coupling parameter to be negative, with no lower bound, for both potentials. This suggests that momentum-exchange coupling between the dark sectors cannot be ruled out. From the stability analysis, we observe that for both potentials, the late-time attractor corresponds to a dark energy dominated phase, and the scalar field can behave as a stiff fluid during the early epoch.

2025-06-26, **On the Dark-Energy Enigma**, Ali H. Chamseddine et.al., [2506.21099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21099v1)

 We present a model that offers an explanation for the presence of (Dark Matter and) Dark Energy in the universe. A key idea is to express the volume form of the Lorentzian metric on space-time in terms of a positive function of a new scalar field multiplying a certain four-form given by the wedge product of the differential of the mimetic scalar field and a certain closed three-form. An ansatz for this three-form related to one commonly used to determine the winding number of a map from a three-dimensional hypersurface to a three-sphere is discussed. An action functional depending on the space-time metric, the new scalar field, the mimetic scalar and the three-form is proposed, and the field equations are derived. Special solutions of these equations for a Friedmann-Lema\^itre universe are presented.

2025-06-26, **Statistical Strong Lensing as a Test of Conformal Gravity**, Li-Xue Yue et.al., [2506.21019v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21019v1)

 As an alternative gravitational theory to General Relativity (GR), Conformal Gravity (CG) can be verified through astronomical observations. Currently, Mannheim and Kazanas have provided vacuum solutions for cosmological and local gravitational systems, and these solutions may resolve the dark matter and dark energy issues encountered in GR, making them particularly valuable. For static, spherically symmetric systems, CG predicts an additional linear potential generated by luminous matter in addition to the conventional Newtonian potential. This extra potential is expected to account for the observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters without the need of dark matter. It is characterized by the parameter $\gamma^*$, which corresponds to the linear potential generated by the unit of the solar mass, and it is thus a universal constant. The value of $\gamma^\ast$ was determined by fitting the rotation curve data of spiral galaxies. These predictions of CG should also be verified by the observations of strong gravitational lensing. In this study, building upon the previous research, we tested CG via strong lensing statistics. We used a well-defined sample that consisted of both galaxies and galaxy clusters. This allowed us to test CG through statistical strong lensing in a way similar to the conventional approach in GR. As anticipated, our results were consistent with previous studies, namely that the fitted $\gamma^*$ is much larger than that from rotation curves. Intriguingly, we further discovered that, in order to fit the strong lensing data of another sample, the value of $\gamma^*$ cannot be a constant, as is required in CG. Instead, we derived a formula for $\gamma^*$ as a function of the stellar mass $M\_*$ of the galaxies or galaxy clusters. It was found that $\gamma^*$ decreases as $M\_*$ increases.

2025-06-26, **Natal kick by early-asymmetrical pairs of jets to the neutron star of supernova remnant S147**, Dmitry Shishkin et.al., [2506.21548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21548v1)

 We analyze the bipolar morphology of the jet-shaped core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) S147 and its neutron star (NS) kick velocity, and suggest that two pairs of unequal, opposite jets contributed to the NS kick velocity. This kick by early asymmetrical pairs (kick-BEAP) of jets mechanism operates within the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We examine the prominent pair of large ears and, based on their flat structure rather than the more common conical structure of ears, conclude that two pairs of jets close in angle inflated the two opposite ears. We connect two opposite X-ray bright zones by an additional axis to create the full point-symmetric morphology of CCSNR S147. We propose that the two unequal jets that formed the X-ray bright zones imparted the first kick-BEAP, while the two pairs of jets that formed the ears imparted the second kick-BEAP. The two kick velocities are of about equal magnitude of ~450 km/s, which implies very energetic jets. Such jets can excite gravitational waves that present detectors can detect from the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. We use the morphology we identify to estimate the CCSNR age at 23,000 yr. Our results strengthen the JJEM.

2025-06-26, **Quintessence and phantoms in light of DESI 2025**, Ioannis D. Gialamas et.al., [2506.21542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21542v1)

 We analyse DESI BAO, CMB, and supernova data to explore the physical origin of the DESI indication for dynamical dark energy. Beyond the standard CPL parametrization, we explore truncated alternatives and quintessence models. We conclude that there is compelling evidence for dark energy to be decaying in the late universe, but the evidence for a phantom behaviour is less significant. Models without phantom behaviour are compatible with the data at the $2\sigma$ CL. Furthermore, we examine a concrete quintessence scenario with a Higgs-like potential, allowing for a direct comparison with parametrized approaches and testing its consistency with current observations. This framework enables a broader investigation of late-time cosmic evolution and reveals a $93.8\%$ preference for a future transition into an anti-de Sitter space, which may ultimately lead to a cosmological collapse of our Universe.

2025-06-26, **Element nucleosynthetic origins from abundance spatial distributions beyond the Milky Way**, Zefeng Li et.al., [2506.21365v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21365v1)

 An element's astrophysical origin should be reflected in the spatial distribution of its abundance, yielding measurably different spatial distributions for elements with different nucleosynthetic sites. However, most extragalactic multi-element analyses of gas-phase abundances to date have been limited to small numbers of sightlines, making statistical characterization of differences in spatial distributions of elements impossible. Here we use integrated field spectroscopic data covering the full face of the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 sampled at 3.5-pc resolution to produce maps of the abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur using independent direct methods. We find strong evidence for differences in the elements' spatial statistics that mirror their predicted nucleosynthetic origins: the spatial distributions of oxygen and sulfur, both predominantly produced in core-collapse supernovae, indicate that initial injection occurs on larger scales than for nitrogen, which is predominantly produced by asymptotic giant branch stars. All elements are well-correlated but oxygen and sulfur are much better correlated with each other than with nitrogen, consistent with recent results for stellar abundances in the Milky Way. These findings both open a new avenue to test nucleosynthetic models, and make predictions for the structure of stellar chemical abundance distributions.

2025-06-26, **Constraint on Momentum-coupled Dark Energy using DESI DR2**, Prasanta Sahoo et.al., [2506.21295v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21295v1)

 In this work, we study two scalar field driven dark energy models characterized by the axion potential and the inverse power law potential, each coupled to dark matter through a momentum exchange interaction. By formulating the dynamics as an autonomous system, we identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. To constrain these models, we utilize observational data from Pantheon Plus Type Ia Supernovae, DES Y5, DESI DR2 BAO, and Planck 2018 CMB compressed likelihood, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both potentials exhibit weak to strong preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a particularly strong preference for the momentum-coupled scenario when Supernova data are included in the analysis. Furthermore, we find the coupling parameter to be negative, with no lower bound, for both potentials. This suggests that momentum-exchange coupling between the dark sectors cannot be ruled out. From the stability analysis, we observe that for both potentials, the late-time attractor corresponds to a dark energy dominated phase, and the scalar field can behave as a stiff fluid during the early epoch.

2025-06-26, **Exploring Dark Energy via Non-Minimal Coupling in $f(Q,L_m)$ Gravity with Gong-Zhang Parameterization**, Yash B. Ingole et.al., [2506.21083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21083v1)

 In this study, we investigate the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of non-minimally coupled $f(Q,L\_m)$ gravity, where $Q$ is the non-metricity scalar and $L\_m$ is the matter Lagrangian. We derive modified Friedmann equations in a flat FLRW background and employ the \textit{Gong-Zhang} parameterization for the DE equation of state (EoS), allowing an analytical form of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. The model parameters are constrained using recent Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Pantheon+SH0ES Type Ia supernova datasets through MCMC-based chi-squared minimization. We analyze various cosmological quantities including the deceleration parameter, EoS, jerk, snap, lerk, and diagnostic tools such as $Om(z)$ and the statefinder pair $(r,s)$. Our findings indicate a viable transition from deceleration to acceleration and reveal a quintessence-to-phantom-like evolution of dark energy. Furthermore, energy conditions are examined, showing a violation of the strong energy condition, consistent with current cosmic acceleration. The results establish that the $f(Q,L\_m) $ framework with non-minimal coupling and parameterized EoS provides a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration.
