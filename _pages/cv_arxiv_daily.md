2024-06-20, **Neutrino mass bounds from DESI 2024 are relaxed by Planck PR4 and cosmological supernovae**, Itamar J. Allali et.al., [2406.14554v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14554v1)

 The recent DESI 2024 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements combined with the CMB data from the Planck 18 PR3 dataset and the Planck PR4+ACT DR6 lensing data, with a prior on the sum of the neutrino masses $\sum m\_\nu>0$, leads to a strong constraint, $\sum m\_\nu<0.072$ eV, which would exclude the inverted neutrino hierarchy and put some tension on even the standard hierarchy. We show that actually this bound gets significantly relaxed when combining the new DESI measurements with the HiLLiPoP+LoLLiPoP likelihoods, based on the Planck 2020 PR4 dataset, and with supernovae datasets. We note that the fact that neutrino masses are pushed towards zero, and even towards negative values, is known to be correlated with the so-called $A\_L$ tension, a mismatch between lensing and power spectrum measurements in the Planck PR3 data, which is reduced by HiLLiPoP+LoLLiPoP to less than 1$\sigma$. We find $\sum m\_\nu<0.1$ eV and $\sum m\_\nu<0.12$ eV, with the supernovae Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR datasets respectively. The shift caused by these datasets is more compatible with the expectations from neutrino oscillation experiments, and both the normal and inverted hierarchy scenarios remain now viable, even with the $\sum m\_\nu>0$ prior. Finally, we analyze neutrino mass bounds in an extension of $\Lambda$CDM that addresses the $H\_0$ tension, with extra fluid Dark Radiation, finding that in such models bounds are further relaxed and the posterior probability for $\sum m\_\nu$ begins to exhibit a peak at positive values.

2024-06-20, **$P$ & $m_e$**, Ravi Kuchimanchi et.al., [2406.14480v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14480v1)

 Curiously in the minimal left right symmetric model, chiral ($\chi$) symmetry that protects the electron's mass ($m\_e$), due to parity (P) implies the vanishing of its neutrino mixing angles. We break the $\chi$ symmetry to generate the observed neutrino mixing which causes the electron to acquire its mass on RGE running, and in turn determines the B-L gauge symmetry breaking scale ($v\_R$) to be $10^{10} GeV \lesssim v\_R \leq 10^{15} GeV $ (and with fine-tuning can be at $10 TeV$ scale). If the muon's mass is also generated radiatively, the B-L breaking scale is $\sim 10^{14-15}$ GeV. Regardless of how the high scale $v\_R$ is, this is a testable model for obtaining the mass of the electron (and muon), since on RGE running and P breaking, a large strong CP phase ($\bar{\theta} >> 10^{-10}$) which depends logarithmically on $v\_R$ is generated if there is O(1) CP violation in leptonic Yukawa couplings. Hence we expect that leptonic CP phases including the Dirac CP phase $\delta\_{CP}$ of the PMNS matrix must be consistent with $0$ or $180^o$ to within a degree, which can be verified or excluded by neutrino experiments such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande. In lieu of P, if charge conjugation C is used, the same results follow. However with C and no P, axions would likely need to be added anyway, in which case there is no constraint on $\delta\_{CP}$.

2024-06-20, **A hierarchical Bayesian approach to point source analysis in high-energy neutrino telescopes**, F. Capel et.al., [2406.14268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14268v1)

 We propose a novel approach to the detection of point-like sources of high-energy neutrinos. Motivated by evidence for emerging sources in existing data, we focus on the characterisation and interpretation of these sources. The hierarchical Bayesian model is implemented in the Stan platform, enabling computation of the posterior distribution with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We simulate a population of weak neutrino sources detected by the IceCube experiment and use the resulting data set to demonstrate and validate our framework. We show that even for the challenging case of sources at the threshold of detection and using limited prior information, it is possible to correctly infer the source properties. Additionally, we demonstrate how modelling flexible connections between similar sources can be used to recover the contribution of sources that would not be detectable individually, going beyond what is possible with existing stacking methods.

2024-06-20, **First Demonstration of a Combined Light and Charge Pixel Readout on the Anode Plane of a LArTPC**, N. Anfimov et.al., [2406.14121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14121v1)

 The novel SoLAr concept aims to extend sensitivities of liquid-argon neutrino detectors down to the MeV scale for next-generation detectors. SoLAr plans to accomplish this with a liquid-argon time projection chamber that employs an anode plane with dual charge and light readout, which enables precision matching of light and charge signals for data acquisition and reconstruction purposes. We present the results of a first demonstration of the SoLAr detector concept with a small-scale prototype detector integrating a pixel-based charge readout and silicon photomultipliers on a shared printed circuit board. We discuss the design of the prototype, and its operation and performance, highlighting the capability of such a detector design.

2024-06-20, **A Collaborative Explanation of Cosmic Ray Spectrum Based on the Gluon Condensation Model**, Jintao Wu et.al., [2406.14002v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14002v1)

 Based on the Gluon Condensation (GC) model, the relationship between the spectra of electrons, $\gamma$ rays, and neutrinos in cosmic rays can be deduced. It has been found that these particles share the same parameter, $\beta\_p$, and have an identical GC threshold values. This paper explores the connection between the second excess spectra of electron and the spectra of gamma rays and neutrinos. According to the observed gamma-ray data, it is suggested that the source LHAASO J2108+5157 might contribute to the second excess of electron.

2024-06-20, **High-energy Neutrino Emission from NGC 1068 by Outflow-cloud Interactions**, Yong-Han Huang et.al., [2406.14001v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14001v1)

 As the hottest high-energy neutrino spot, NGC 1068 has received much attention in recent years. Here we focus on the central region of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and propose an outflow-cloud interaction model that could probably explain the observed neutrino data. Considering the accretion process adjacent to the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of NGC 1068, strong outflows will be generated, which will likely interact with surrounding clouds floating in the corona region. Particles carried by the outflow will be accelerated to very high energy by the shocks forming during the outflow-cloud interactions. For the accelerated high-energy protons, $p\gamma$ interactions with the background photon field of the corona and disk and $pp$ interaction with the surrounding gas will produce considerable high-energy $\gamma$-rays and neutrino. However, because of the extremely dense photon fields in the corona and disk, the newly generated $\gamma$-rays will be significantly attenuated through the $\gamma\gamma$ absorptions. In our scenario, the expected GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray emission will be suppressed to a much lower level than the neutrino emission, consistent with the observational characteristics of NGC 1068, while the generated 1-30\,TeV neutrino flux can fit the IceCube data very well.

2024-06-19, **Dark Matter and General Relativistic Instability in Supermassive Stars**, Kyle S. Kehrer et.al., [2406.13887v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13887v1)

 We calculate the extent to which collisionless dark matter impacts the stability of supermassive stars $(M\gtrsim10^4\,M\_\odot)$. We find that, depending on the star's mass, a dark matter content in excess of ${\sim}1\%$ by mass throughout the entire star can raise the critical central density for the onset general relativistic instability, in some cases by orders of magnitude. We consider implications of this effect for the onset of nuclear burning and significant neutrino energy losses.

2024-06-19, **Quasi-Dirac Heavy Neutral Leptons in the Left-Right Symmetric Model**, Oleksii Mikulenko et.al., [2406.13850v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13850v1)

 We discuss the phenomenology of a pair of degenerate GeV-scale Heavy Neutral Leptons within the Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) framework, with the third fermion serving as a dark matter candidate. We highlight the potential of the recently approved SHiP experiment to test the existence of the light DM species, and the signatures of lepton number violation as a possible experimental probe of the model in various experiments. Our findings include concrete predictions, in some part of the model's parameter space, for the effective right-handed couplings $(V^{R}\_{e})^2:(V^{R}\_{\mu})^2:(V^{R}\_{\tau})^2 = 0.16:0.47:0.38$ (normal neutrino hierarchy), $0.489 : 0.22 : 0.30$ (inverted hierarchy) of the degenerate pair.

2024-06-19, **First detection of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering on germanium**, S. Adamski et.al., [2406.13806v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13806v1)

 We report the first detection of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) on germanium, measured at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The Ge-Mini detector of the COHERENT collaboration employs large-mass, low-noise, high-purity germanium spectrometers, enabling excellent energy resolution, and an analysis threshold of 1.5 keV electron-equivalent ionization energy. We observe a on-beam excess of 20.6$\_{+7.1}^{-6.3}$ counts with a total exposure of 10.22 GWhkg and we reject the no-CEvNS hypothesis with 3.9 sigma significance. The result agrees with the predicted standard model of particle physics signal rate within 2 sigma.

2024-06-19, **Multi-messenger Approach to Ultra-light Scalars**, Indra Kumar Banerjee et.al., [2406.13756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13756v1)

 We propose a novel method to study the ultra-light scalars, where compact rotating objects undergo the phenomenon of superradiance to create gravitational waves and neutrino flux signals. The neutrino flux results from the 'right' coupling between the ultra-light scalars and the neutrinos. We study the intertwining of gravitational waves and neutrino flux signals produced from a single source and elaborate if and when the signals can be detected in existing and upcoming experiments in a direct manner. We also discuss an indirect way to test it by means of cosmic neutrino background which can be detected by upcoming PTOLEMY experiment.

2024-06-19, **Insights into the Production of $^{44}$Ti and Nickel Isotopes in Core-Collapse Supernovae**, Tianshu Wang et.al., [2406.13746v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13746v1)

 We report nucleosynthetic results for both $^{44}$Ti and nickel isotopes for eighteen three-dimensional (3D) core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations extended to $\sim$20 seconds after bounce. We find that many of our long-term models are able to achieve $^{44}$Ti/$^{56}$Ni ratios similar to that observed in Cassiopeia A, and modern supernova models can synthesize up to $2\times10^{-4}M\_\odot$ of $^{44}$Ti. Neutrino-driven winds and the fact that there can be simultaneous accretion and explosion in 3D models of core-collapse supernovae play central roles in its production. We conclude that the $^{44}$Ti underproduction problem in previous CCSN models is no longer an issue. In addition, we discuss the production of both $^{57}$Ni and stable nickel/iron ratios and compare our results to observations of SN1987A and the Crab.

2024-06-19, **Neutrino Tomography of the Earth: the Earth Total Mass, Moment of Inertia and Hydrostatic Equilibrium Constraints**, S. T. Petcov et.al., [2406.13727v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13727v1)

 We investigate the implications of the constraints following from the precise knowledge of the total Earth mass, $M\_\oplus$, and moment of inertia, $I\_\oplus$, and from the requirement that Earth be in hydrostatic equilibrium (EHE), in the neutrino tomography studies of the Earth density structure. In order to estimate the sensitivity of a given neutrino detector to possible deviations of the inner core (IC), outer core (OC), core (IC + OC) and mantle Earth densities from those obtained using geophysical and seismological data and described by the preliminary reference Earth model (PREM), in the statistical analyses performed within the neutrino tomography studies one typically varies the density of each of these structures. These variations, however, must respect the $M\_\oplus$, $I\_\oplus$ and EHE constraints. Working with PREM average densities we derive the $M\_\oplus$, $I\_\oplus$ and EHE constraints on the possible density variations when one approximates the Earth density structure with i) three layers - mantle, outer core and inner core, and ii) four layers - upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core and inner core. We get drastically different results in the two cases.

2024-06-19, **Neutrino trident scattering at the LHC energy regime**, Reinaldo Francener et.al., [2406.13593v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13593v1)

 The neutrino trident scattering process in neutrino - tungsten interactions at the LHC energy regime is investigated, and the cross-sections for different leptonic final states in coherent and incoherent interactions are estimated. Furthermore, the associated number of eventsat FASER$\nu$2 detector is estimated considering different predictions for the flux of incident neutrinos on the detector, based on distinct hadronic models for the particle production in $pp$ collisions at ultra-forward rapidities. Our results indicate that the observation of the neutrino trident process is, in principle, feasible at the Forward Physics Facility.

2024-06-19, **Direct neutrino-mass measurement based on 259 days of KATRIN data**, M. Aker et.al., [2406.13516v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13516v1)

 The fact that neutrinos carry a non-vanishing rest mass is evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles. Their absolute mass bears important relevance from particle physics to cosmology. In this work, we report on the search for the effective electron antineutrino mass with the KATRIN experiment. KATRIN performs precision spectroscopy of the tritium $\beta$-decay close to the kinematic endpoint. Based on the first five neutrino-mass measurement campaigns, we derive a best-fit value of $m\_\nu^{2} = {-0.14^{+0.13}\_{-0.15}}~\mathrm{eV^2}$, resulting in an upper limit of $m\_\nu < {0.45}~\mathrm{eV}$ at 90 % confidence level. With six times the statistics of previous data sets, amounting to 36 million electrons collected in 259 measurement days, a substantial reduction of the background level and improved systematic uncertainties, this result tightens KATRIN's previous bound by a factor of almost two.

2024-06-19, **Leptogenesis assisted by scalar decays**, Jun-Yu Tong et.al., [2406.13468v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13468v1)

 We present a pragmatic approach to lower down the mass scale of right-handed neutrinos in leptogenesis by introducing a scalar decaying to right-handed neutrinos. The key point of our proposal is that the out-of-equilibrium decays of the scalar provide an additional source for right-handed neutrinos and hence the lepton asymmetry. This mechanism works well at low temperatures when the washout of the generated lepton asymmetry is suppressed. Thus, the lepton asymmetry can be effectively produced despite the washout effect is strong or not. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that such a scalar-assisted leptogenesis can typically decrease the viable right-handed neutrino mass scale by two to four orders of magnitude.

2024-06-19, **12C+12C Reaction Rates and the Evolution of a Massive Star**, Gwangeon Seong et.al., [2406.13458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13458v1)

 Carbon fusion is important to understand the late stages in the evolution of a massive star. Astronomically interesting energy ranges for the 12C+12C reactions have been, however, poorly constrained by experiments. Theoretical studies on stellar evolution have relied on reaction rates that are extrapolated from those measured in higher energies. In this work, we update the carbon fusion reaction rates by fitting the astrophysical S-factor data obtained from direct measurements based on the Fowler, Caughlan, & Zimmerman (1975) formula. We examine the evolution of a 20 M\_sun star with the updated 12C+12C reaction rates performing simulations with the MESA (Modules for Experiments for Stellar Astrophysics) code. Between 0.5 and 1 GK, the updated reaction rates are 0.35 to 0.5 times less than the rates suggested by Caughlan and Fowler (1988). The updated rates result in the increase of core temperature by about 7% and of the neutrino cooling by about a factor of three. Moreover, the carbon-burning lifetime is reduced by a factor of 2.7. The updated carbon fusion reaction rates lead to some changes in the details of the stellar evolution model, their impact seems relatively minor compared to other uncertain physical factors like convection, overshooting, rotation, and mass-loss history. The astrophysical S-factor measurements in lower energies have large errors below the Coulomb barrier. More precise measurements in lower energies for the carbon burning would be useful to improve our study and to understand the evolution of a massive star.

2024-06-19, **The study of $0νββ$ decay of $^{136}$Xe using nonclosure approach in nuclear shell model**, S. Sarkar et.al., [2406.13417v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13417v1)

 In this investigation, we compute the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) relevant to the light neutrino-exchange mechanism governing neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay in $^{136}$Xe. Our method is based on the nonclosure approach within the interacting nuclear shell model framework. This approach considers the genuine effects arising from the excitation energies of two hundred states for each spin-parity of the intermediary nucleus $^{136}$Cs. All computations are performed using the effective shell model Hamiltonian GCN5082. To understand the impact of nuclear structure on $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, we explore the dependence of the NME on various factors, including the number of intermediate states and their spin-parity characteristics. We identify an optimal closure energy of approximately 3.7 MeV for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{136}$Xe that reproduces the nonclosure NME using the closure approach. The calculated total NME for the light neutrino-exchange $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{136}$Xe is 2.06 with the CD-Bonn short-range correlation (SRC). These results can be valuable for future experimental investigations into the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{136}$Xe.

2024-06-19, **Berezinsky Hidden Sources: An Emergent Tension in the High-Energy Neutrino Sky?**, Antonio Ambrosone et.al., [2406.13336v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13336v1)

 The IceCube Collaboration has recently reported compelling evidence of high-energy neutrino emission from NGC~1068, and also mild excesses for NGC 4151 and CGCG420-015, local Seyfert galaxies. This has increased the interest along neutrino emission from hot-corona surrounding the super massive black holes of Seyfert Galaxies. In this paper, we revisit phenomenological constraints on the neutrino emission from hot-coronae of seyfert galaxies, using an assumption of equi-ripartition between cosmic-rays and magnetic energy densities. We show that not only these sources are consistent with such an assumption but also that the data point towards low beta plasma parameters inside Seyfert Galaxies. We exploit this finding to constrain the Seyfert diffuse neutrino flux and we obtain that, in order not to overproduce neutrinos, not all the sources can be in an equi-ripartition state. We conclude (along with previous findings) that seyfert galaxies cannot explain the diffuse neutrino spectrum above $\sim 100\, \rm TeV$, allowing space for other astrophysical sources.

2024-06-19, **Dimuon production in neutrino-nucleus collisions -- the SIDIS approach**, Ilkka Helenius et.al., [2406.13304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13304v1)

 Dimuon production is in many global parton distribution function analyses calculated by assuming that it is proportional to inclusive charm production. As this assumption breaks down at next-to-leading order in the perturbative expansion, we present a direct calculation of dimuon production that does not require an external acceptance correction. Our calculation utilizes semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and a decay function fitted to experimental data. We find our calculation to be in good agreement with available experimental data. Here we also demonstrate that the acceptance correction depends on the used parton distribution and perturbative order.

2024-06-19, **Impacts of Black-Hole-Forming Supernova Explosions on the Diffuse Neutrino Background**, Ken'ichiro Nakazato et.al., [2406.13276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13276v1)

 Flux spectrum, event rate, and experimental sensitivity are investigated for the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), which is originated from past stellar collapses and also known as supernova relic neutrino background. For this purpose, the contribution of collapses that lead to successful supernova (SN) explosion and black hole (BH) formation simultaneously, which are suggested to be a non-negligible population from the perspective of Galactic chemical evolution, is taken into account. If the BH-forming SNe involve the matter fallback onto the protoneutron star for the long term, their total emitted neutrino energy becomes much larger than that of ordinary SNe and failed SNe (BH formation without explosion). The expected event rate according to the current DSNB model is enhanced by up to a factor of two due to the BH-forming SNe, depending on their fraction and the neutrino mass hierarchy. In any case, the operation time required to detect the DSNB at Hyper-Kamiokande would be reduced by such contribution.

2024-06-20, **Complex Dark Photon Dark Matter EFT**, Enrico Bertuzzo et.al., [2406.14437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14437v1)

 We construct an effective field theory for complex Stueckelberg dark photon dark matter. Such an effective construction can be realized by writing down a complete set of operators up to dimension six built with the complex dark photon and Standard Model fields. Classifying the effective operators, we find that in order to properly take into account the non-renormalizable nature of an interacting massive vector, the size of the Wilson coefficients should be naturally smaller than naively expected. This can be consistently taken into account by a proper power counting, that we suggest. First we apply this to collider bounds on light dark matter, then to direct detection searches by extending the list of non-relativistic operators to include the case of complex vectors. In the former we correctly find scaling limits for small masses, while in the latter we mostly focus on electric dipole interactions, that are the smoking gun of this type of dark matter. Simple UV completions that effectively realize the above scenarios are also outlined.

2024-06-20, **Exploring new physics via effective interactions**, Ekata Singh et.al., [2406.14389v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14389v1)

 We investigate self-conjugate Dark Matter (DM) particles that primarily interact with standard model electroweak gauge bosons within an effective field theoretical framework. Our analysis focuses on effective contact interactions, invariant under the standard model gauge group, between Majorana fermions, and real scalar DM, with SM neutral electroweak gauge bosons. We calculate the Wilson coefficients for interaction terms up to dimension-8 and establish constraints on the theory's parameters. These constraints are derived from the observed relic density, and indirect detection observations. We discuss the potential for dark matter-nucleon scattering in direct detection experiments. Additionally, we utilize low-energy LEP data to assess sensitivity to the pair production of low-mass ($\leq$ 80 GeV) DM particles. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) in probing effective operators through the pair production of DM particles with masses $\geq$ 50 GeV in association with mono-photons.

2024-06-20, **Exact solutions for differentially rotating galaxies in general relativity**, Marco Galoppo et.al., [2406.14157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14157v1)

 A class of stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's equations for isolated differentially rotating dust sources is presented. The low-energy asymptotic regime is extracted, requiring a self-consistent coupling of quasilocal energy and angular momentum. The Raychaudhuri equation reduces to a balance equation, with two important limits. These limits can be interpreted empirically for rotationally supported configurations such as galaxies. The net energy including quasilocal kinetic contributions vanishes on the inner vortex surface, and the outer rotosurface. These new geometrical objects potentially shed light on virialization. Whether or not abundant collisionless dark matter exists, the new solutions suggest that the phenomenology of galactic rotation curves be fundamentally reconsidered, for consistency with general relativity.

2024-06-19, **Formation of super-thin galaxies in Illustris-TNG**, Jianhong Hu et.al., [2406.13745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13745v1)

 Superthin galaxies are observed to have stellar disks with extremely small minor-to-major axis ratios. In this work, we investigate the formation of superthin galaxies in the TNG100 simulation. We trace the merger history and investigate the evolution of galaxy properties of a selected sample of superthin galaxies and a control sample of galaxies that share the same joint probability distribution in the stellar-mass and color diagram. Through making comparisons between the two galaxy samples, we find that present-day superthin galaxies had similar morphologies as the control sample counterparts at higher redshifts, but have developed extended flat `superthin' morphologies since $z \sim 1$. During this latter evolution stage, superthin galaxies undergo overwhelmingly higher frequency of prograde mergers (with orbit-spin angle $\theta\_{\rm orb} \leqslant 40^\circ$). Accordingly the spins of their dark matter halos have grown significantly and become noticeably higher than that of their normal disk counterparts. This further results in the buildup of their stellar disks at larger distances much beyond the regimes of normal disk galaxies. We also discuss the formation scenario of those superthin galaxies that live in larger dark matter halos as satellite galaxies therein.

2024-06-19, **On the dark matter content of ultra-diffuse galaxies**, Andrey Kravtsov et.al., [2406.13732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13732v1)

 I compare the dark matter content within stellar half-mass radius expected in a $\Lambda$CDM-based galaxy formation model with existing observational estimates for the observed dwarf satellites of the Milky Way and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). The model reproduces the main properties and scaling relations of dwarf galaxies, in particular their stellar mass-size relation. I show that the model also reproduces the relation between the dark matter mass within the half-mass radius, $M\_{\rm dm}(<r\_{1/2})$, and stellar mass exhibited by the observed dwarf galaxies. The scatter in the $M\_{\rm dm}(<r\_{1/2})-M\_\star$ relation is driven primarily by the broad range of sizes of galaxies of a given stellar mass. I also show the $M\_{\rm dm}(<r\_{1/2})$ of UDGs are within the range expected in the model for their stellar mass, but they tend to lie above the median relation due to their large sizes. The upper limits on $M\_{\rm dm}(<r\_{1/2})$ for the dark matter deficient UDGs are also consistent with the range of dark matter masses expected in the model. The most dark matter-deficient galaxies of a given size correspond to halos with the smallest concentrations and the largest ratios of $M\_\star/M\_{\rm 200c}$. Conversely, the most dark matter-dominated galaxies are hosted by the highest concentration halos with the smallest $M\_\star/M\_{\rm 200c}$ ratios. The model indicates that the scatter between $M\_{\rm dm}(<r\_{1/2})$ and $M\_{\rm 200c}$ is large, which renders inference of the virial mass from $M\_{\rm dm}(<r\_{1/2})$ uncertain and dependent on specific assumptions about the halo mass profile. Results presented in this paper indicate that dark matter-deficient UDGs may represent a tail of the expected dark matter profiles, especially if the effect of feedback on these profiles is taken into account.

2024-06-19, **Matter Power Spectra in Modified Gravity: A Comparative Study of Approximations and $N$-Body Simulations**, Benjamin Bose et.al., [2406.13667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13667v1)

 Testing gravity and the concordance model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, at large scales is a key goal of this decade's largest galaxy surveys. Here we present a comparative study of dark matter power spectrum predictions from different numerical codes in the context of three popular theories of gravity that induce scale-independent modifications to the linear growth of structure: nDGP, Cubic Galileon and K-mouflage. In particular, we compare the predictions from full $N$-body simulations, two $N$-body codes with approximate time integration schemes, a parametrised modified $N$-body implementation and the analytic halo model reaction approach. We find the modification to the $\Lambda$CDM spectrum is in $2\%$ agreement for $z\leq1$ and $k\leq 1~h/{\rm Mpc}$ over all gravitational models and codes, in accordance with many previous studies, indicating these modelling approaches are robust enough to be used in forthcoming survey analyses under appropriate scale cuts. We further make public the new code implementations presented, specifically the halo model reaction K-mouflage implementation and the relativistic Cubic Galileon implementation.

2024-06-19, **XENONnT WIMP Search: Signal & Background Modeling and Statistical Inference**, XENON Collaboration et.al., [2406.13638v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13638v1)

 The XENONnT experiment searches for weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter scattering off a xenon nucleus. In particular, XENONnT uses a dual-phase time projection chamber with a 5.9-tonne liquid xenon target, detecting both scintillation and ionization signals to reconstruct the energy, position, and type of recoil. A blind search for nuclear recoil WIMPs with an exposure of 1.1 tonne-years yielded no signal excess over background expectations, from which competitive exclusion limits were derived on WIMP-nucleon elastic scatter cross sections, for WIMP masses ranging from 6 GeV/$c^2$ up to the TeV/$c^2$ scale. This work details the modeling and statistical methods employed in this search. By means of calibration data, we model the detector response, which is then used to derive background and signal models. The construction and validation of these models is discussed, alongside additional purely data-driven backgrounds. We also describe the statistical inference framework, including the definition of the likelihood function and the construction of confidence intervals.

 It was known that an ideal spherically symmetric stellar system with isotropic velocities and an inner core cannot reside in a Navarro, Frenk, and White (NFW) gravitational potential. The incompatibility can be pinned down to the radial gradient of the NFW potential in the very center of the system, which differs from zero. The gradient is identically zero in an Einasto potential, also an alternative representation of the dark matter (DM) halos created by the kind of cold DM (CDM) defining the current cosmological model. Here we show that, despite the inner gradient being zero, stellar cores are also inconsistent with Einasto potentials. This result may have implications to constrain the nature of DM through interpreting the stellar cores often observed in dwarf galaxies.

 Gravitational wave (GW) birefringence is a remarkable phenomenon that can be used to test the parity violation in gravity. By coupling the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) scalar to the gravitational Chern-Simons term, we explore the GW birefringence effects in the FDM background. In particular, in light of the highly oscillating granular FDM structure at the galactic scale, we are led to investigating the GW propagation in the Chern-Simons gravity over the general nontrivial scalar profile, which is a natural extension of previous studies on the homogeneous and isotropic configurations. As a result, it is found that GWs of both circularly polarized modes propagate in the straight line with the speed of light, and does not show any velocity birefringence. However, when considering the imaginary part of the dispersion relation, GWs exhibit the amplitude birefringence in which one circular polarization is enhanced while the other suppressed. Due to its local nature, the FDM-induced amplitude birefringence only depends on the GW frequency without any reliance on the GW event distance. More importantly, the birefringence factor shows a periodic time variation with the period reflecting the FDM scalar mass, which is the smoking gun for testing this new birefringence mechanism. Finally, we also study the extra-galactic FDM contribution to the GW birefringence, which is shown to be suppressed by the cosmological DM density and thus subdominant compared with the galactic counterpart.

 Recently, there has been significant interest regarding the regularization of a $D\rightarrow 4$ limit of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. This regularization involves re-scaling the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling constant as $\alpha/(D-4)$, which bypasses Lovelock's theorem and avoids Ostrogradsky instability. A noteworthy observation is that the maximally or spherically symmetric solutions for all the regularized gravities coincide in the $4D$ scenario. Considering this, we investigate the wormhole solutions in the galactic halos based on three different choices of dark matter (DM) profiles, such as Universal Rotation Curve, Navarro-Frenk-White, and Scalar Field Dark Matter with the framework of $4D$ EGB gravity. Also, the Karmarkar condition was used to find the exact solutions for the shape functions under different non-constant redshift functions. We discussed the energy conditions for each DM profile and noticed the influence of GB coefficient $\alpha$ in violating energy conditions, especially null energy conditions. Further, some physical features of wormholes, viz. complexity factor, active gravitational mass, total gravitational energy, and embedding diagrams, have been explored.

2024-06-20, **Investigating the Role of Pre-supernova Massive Stars in the Acceleration of Galactic Cosmic Rays**, Michael De Becker et.al., [2406.14195v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14195v1)

 Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) constitute a significant part of the energy budget of our Galaxy, and the study of their accelerators is of high importance in modern astrophysics. Their main sources are likely supernova remnants (SNRs). These objects are capable to convert a part of their mechanical energy into accelerated charged particles. However, even though the mechanical energy reservoir of SNRs is promising, a conversion rate into particle energy of 10 to 20% is necessary to feed the population of GCRs. Such an efficiency is however not guaranteed. Complementary sources deserve thus to be investigated. This communication aims to address the question of the contribution to the acceleration of GCRs by pre-supernova massive stars in binary or higher multiplicity systems

2024-06-20, **Evidence for bipolar explosions in Type IIP supernovae**, T. Nagao et.al., [2406.14057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14057v1)

 Recent observations of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) suggest aspherical explosions. Globally aspherical structures in SN explosions are regarded as the key for understanding their explosion mechanism. However, the exact explosion geometries from the inner cores to the outer envelopes are poorly understood. Here, we present photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric observations of the Type IIP SN 2021yja and discuss its explosion geometry, in comparison to those of other Type IIP SNe that show large-scale aspherical structures in their hydrogen envelopes (SNe 2012aw, 2013ej and 2017gmr). During the plateau phase, SNe 2012aw and 2021yja exhibit high continuum polarization characterized by two components with perpendicular polarization angles. This behavior can be interpreted to be due to a bipolar explosion, composed of a polar (energetic) and an equatorial (bulk) components of the SN ejecta. In such a bipolar explosion, an aspherical axis created by the polar ejecta would be dominating at early phases, while the perpendicular axis along the equatorial ejecta would emerge at late phases after the receding of the photosphere in the polar ejecta. The interpretation of the bipolar explosions in SNe 2012aw and 2021yja is also supported by other observational properties, including the time evolution of the line velocities and the line shapes in the nebular spectra. The polarization of other Type IIP SNe that show large-scale aspherical structures in the hydrogen envelope (SNe 2013ej and 2017gmr) is also consistent with the bipolar-explosion scenario, although this is not conclusive.

2024-06-19, **Multi-wavelength observations of the Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient AT2023fhn**, A. A. Chrimes et.al., [2406.13821v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13821v1)

 Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are a class of extragalactic transients notable for their rapid rise and fade times, blue colour and accompanying luminous X-ray and radio emission. Only a handful have been studied in detail since the prototypical example AT2018cow. Their origins are currently unknown, but ongoing observations of previous and new events are placing ever stronger constraints on their progenitors. We aim to put further constraints on the LFBOT AT2023fhn, and LFBOTs as a class, using information from the multi-wavelength transient light-curve, its host galaxy and local environment. Our primary results are obtained by fitting galaxy models to the spectral energy distribution of AT2023fhn's host and local environment, and by modelling the radio light-curve of AT2023fhn as due to synchrotron self-absorbed emission from an expanding blast-wave in the circumstellar medium. We find that the neither the host galaxy nor circumstellar environment of AT2023fhn are unusual compared with previous LFBOTs, but that AT2023fhn has a much lower X-ray to ultraviolet luminosity ratio than previous events. We argue that the variety in ultraviolet-optical to X-ray luminosity ratios among LFBOTs is likely due to viewing angle differences, and that the diffuse, yet young local environment of AT2023fhn - combined with a similar circumstellar medium to previous events - favours a progenitor system containing a massive star with strong winds. Plausible progenitor models in this interpretation therefore include black hole/Wolf-Rayet mergers or failed supernovae.

2024-06-19, **Strongly lensed supernovae: lessons learned**, Ariel Goobar et.al., [2406.13519v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13519v1)

 Since a few years, we have finally entered the era of discoveries of multiply-imaged gravitationally lensed supernovae. To date, all cluster lensed supernovae have been found from space, while those deflected by individual galaxies were identified with wide-field ground-based surveys through the magnification of "standard candles" method, i.e., without the need of spatially resolving the individual images. We review the challenges in identifying these extremely rare events, as well as the unique opportunities they offer for time-delay cosmography and the study of the properties of the deflecting bodies acting as lenses.

2024-06-19, **Multi-messenger modeling of the Monogem pulsar halo**, Youyou Li et.al., [2406.13426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13426v1)

 The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Telescope (HAWC) has detected TeV halos associated with two nearby pulsars/pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) -- Geminga and B0656+14. These TeV halos extend up to tens of pc from the central accelerators, indicating that the diffusion of ultrarelativistic electrons and positrons in the interstellar medium has been suppressed by two orders of magnitude. Although Geminga and B0656+14 are at similar distances and in the same field of view, they have distinct histories. Notably, B0656+14 probably still resides within its parent supernova remnant, the Monogem Ring, which can be observed in X-rays. In this work, we perform high-resolution simulations of the propagation and emission of relativistic lepton pairs around B0656+14 using a two-zone diffusion model using the GALPROP numerical code. We compared the predicted inverse-Compton spectrum to the observations made by HAWC and Fermi-LAT and found physically plausible model parameters that resulted in a good fit to the data. Additionally, we estimated the contribution of this TeV-halo to the positron flux observed on Earth and found it to be smaller than 10\% of the measured flux. We conclude that future observations of the TeV halo and its synchrotron emission counterpart in radio and X-ray frequencies will be crucial to distinguish between various possible models.

2024-06-19, **Suppression without Thawing: Constraining Structure Formation and Dark Energy with Galaxy Clustering**, Shi-Fan Chen et.al., [2406.13388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13388v1)

 We present a new perturbative full-shape analysis of BOSS galaxy clustering data, including the full combination of the galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cross-correlations with the gravitational lensing of cosmic microwave background measured from \textit{Planck}. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we constrain the matter density fraction $\Omega\_m = 0.3154\pm 0.0089$, the Hubble constant $H\_0=68.34\pm 0.77\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma\_8=0.686\pm 0.027$ (equivalent to $S\_8 = 0.704\pm 0.031$). Cosmic structure at low redshifts appears suppressed with respect to the Planck $\Lambda$CDM concordance model at $4.5\sigma$. We explore whether this tension can be explained by the recent DESI preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE): the BOSS data combine with DESI BAO and PantheonPlus supernovae competitively compared to the CMB, yielding no preference for DDE, but the same $\sim 10\%$ suppression of structure, with dark energy being consistent with a cosmological constant at 68\% CL. Our results suggest that either the data contains residual systematics, or more model-building efforts may be required to restore cosmological concordance.

2024-06-19, **Cosmic slowing down of acceleration with the Chaplygin-Jacobi gas as a dark fluid**, J. A. S. Fortunato et.al., [2406.13132v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13132v1)

 A particular generalization of the Chaplygin inflationary model, using the formalism of Hamilton-Jacobi and elliptic functions, results in a more general non-linear Chaplygin-type equation of state (Chaplygin-Jacobi model). We investigate the implementation of this model as a dark energy (DE) fluid to explain the recent acceleration of the universe. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM and other Chaplygin-like fluids, where the final fate of the universe is an eternal de Sitter (dS) phase, the dynamics of this model allow for the possibility of a decelerating phase in the future, following the current accelerating phase. In other words, a transient acceleration arises, accounting for the recently claimed slowing down phenomenon. This Chaplygin-Jacobi model shows important differences compared to the standard and generalized Chaplygin gas models. Additionally, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using several datasets, including Type Ia Supernovae (SnIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), to examine the observational viability of the model. Our results indicate that a transient phase of accelerated expansion is not excluded by current observations.
