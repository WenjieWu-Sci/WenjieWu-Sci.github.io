2024-01-24, **Relativistic meson-exchange currents in semi-inclusive lepton scattering**, Valerio Belocchi et.al., [2401.13640v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13640v1)

 We assess the impact of two-particle--two-hole excitations on the semi-inclusive electron scattering process (e,e'p) using a fully relativistic nuclear model calculation that precisely incorporates antisymmetrization. The calculation encompasses all contributions involving the exchange of a single pion and the excitation of a Delta resonance. Our results are compared with (e,e'p) data on carbon at kinematics where two-nucleon emission dominates. This work represents an essential step towards the microscopic computation of the two-particle--two-hole contribution to semi-inclusive neutrino reactions, crucial in the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments.

2024-01-24, **Search for new phenomena with top-quark pairs and large missing transverse momentum using 140 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector**, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., [2401.13430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13430v1)

 A search is conducted for new phenomena in events with a top quark pair and large missing transverse momentum, where the top quark pair is reconstructed in final states with one isolated electron or muon and multiple jets. The search is performed using the Large Hadron Collider proton--proton collision data sample at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. An analysis based on neural network classifiers is optimised to search for directly produced pairs of supersymmetric partners of the top quark (stop), and to search for spin-0 mediators, produced in association with a pair of top quarks, that decay into dark-matter particles. In the stop search, the analysis is designed to target models in which the mass difference between the stop and the neutralino from the stop decay is close to the top quark mass. This new search is combined with previously published searches in final states with different lepton multiplicities. No significant excess above the Standard Model background is observed, and limits at 95% confidence level are set. Models with neutralinos with masses up to 570 GeV are excluded, while for small neutralino masses models are excluded for stop masses up to 1230 GeV. Scalar (pseudoscalar) dark matter mediator masses as large as 350 (370) GeV are excluded when the coupling strengths of the mediator to Standard Model and dark-matter particles are both set to one. At lower mediator masses, models with production cross-sections as small as 0.15 (0.16) times the nominal predictions are excluded. Results of this search are also used to set constraints on effective four-fermion contact interactions between top quarks and neutrinos.

2024-01-24, **Î½Oscillation: a software package for computation and simulation of neutrino propagation and interaction**, Seonghyeok Jang et.al., [2401.13215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13215v1)

 The behavior of neutrinos is the only phenomenon that cannot be explained by the standard model of particle physics. Because of these mysterious neutrino interactions observed in nature, at present, there is growing interest in this field and ongoing or planned neutrino experiments are seeking solutions to this mystery very actively. The design of neutrino experiments and the analysis of neutrino data rely on precise computations of neutrino oscillations and scattering processes in general. Motivated by this, we developed a software package that calculates neutrino production and oscillation in nuclear reactors, neutrino-electron scattering of solar neutrinos, and the oscillation of neutrinos from radioactive isotopes for the search of sterile neutrinos. This software package is validated by reproducing the result of calculations and observations in other publications. We also demonstrate the feasibility of this package by calculating the sensitivity of a liquid scintillator detector, currently in planning, to the sterile neutrinos. This work is expected to be used in designs of future neutrino experiments.

2024-01-24, **Sommerfeld Enhancement for Vector Dark Matter in the Fundamental Representation of SU(2)_L**, Sebastian Acevedo et.al., [2401.13389v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13389v1)

 In this work, we study an extension of the Standard Model which include a new massive vector field in the fundamental representation of SU(2)\_L. The neutral component of the new vector field is a natural dark matter candidate. We compute the annihilation cross-section with Sommerfeld Enhancement and the Photon Flux arising from Dark Matter annihilation events. We found that the model exhibits a resonant mass part around the range of 5-10 TeV. This resonance is influenced by the choice of portal Higgs coupling parameter. We show that these predictions can be partially tested by CTA in the near future

2024-01-24, **Artificial Precision Timing Array: bridging the decihertz gravitational-wave sensitivity gap with clock satellites**, Lucas M. B. Alves et.al., [2401.13668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13668v1)

 Gravitational-wave astronomy has developed enormously over the last decade with the first detections across different frequency bands, but has yet to access $0.1-10$ $\mathrm{Hz}$ gravitational waves. Gravitational waves in this band are emitted by some of the most enigmatic sources, including intermediate-mass binary black hole mergers, early inspiralling compact binaries, and possibly cosmic inflation. To tap this exciting band, we propose the construction of a detector based on pulsar timing principles, the Artificial Precision Timing Array (APTA). We envision APTA as a solar system array of artificial "pulsars"$-$precision-clock-carrying satellites that emit pulsing electromagnetic signals towards Earth or other centrum. In this fundamental study, we estimate the clock precision needed for APTA to successfully detect gravitational waves. Our results suggest that a clock relative uncertainty of $10^{-17}$, which is currently attainable, would be sufficient for APTA to surpass LISA's sensitivity in the decihertz band and observe $10^3-10^4$ $\mathrm{M}\_\odot$ black hole mergers. Future atomic clock technology realistically expected in the next decade would enable the detection of an increasingly diverse set of astrophysical sources, including stellar-mass compact binaries that merge in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA band, extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, and Type Ia supernovae. This work opens up a new area of research into designing and constructing artificial gravitational-wave detectors relying on the successful principles of pulsar timing.

2024-01-24, **Effects of type Ia supernovae absolute magnitude priors on the Hubble constant value**, Yun Chen et.al., [2401.13187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13187v1)

 We systematically explore the influence of the prior of the peak absolute magnitude ($M$) of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on the measurement of the Hubble constant ($H\_0$) from SNe Ia observations. We consider five different data-motivated $M$ priors, representing varying levels of dispersion, and assume the spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. Different $M$ priors lead to relative changes in the mean values of $H\_0$ from 2% to 6%. Loose priors on $M$ yield $H\_0$ estimates consistent with both the Planck 2018 result and the SH0ES result at the 68% confidence level. We also examine the potential impact of peculiar velocity subtraction on the value of $H\_0$, and show that it is insignificant for the SNe Ia observations with redshift $z > 0.01$ used in our analyses.
