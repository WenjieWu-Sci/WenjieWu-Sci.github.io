2025-01-23, **Redshift leverage for the search of GRB neutrinos affected by quantum properties of spacetime**, Giovanni Amelino-Camelia et.al., [2501.13840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13840v1)

 Some previous studies based on IceCube neutrinos had found intriguing preliminary evidence that some of them might be GRB neutrinos with travel times affected by quantum properties of spacetime delaying them proportionally to their energy, an effect often labeled as "quantum-spacetime-induced in-vacuo dispersion". Those previous studies looked for candidate GRB neutrinos in a fixed (neutrino-energy-independent) time window after the GRB onset and relied rather crucially on crude estimates of the redshift of GRBs whose redshift has not been measured. We here introduce a complementary approach to the search of quantum-spacetime-affected GRB neutrinos which restricts the analysis to GRBs of sharply known redshift, and, in a way that we argue is synergistic with having sharp information on redshift, adopts a neutrino-energy-dependent time window. We find that knowing the redshift of the GRBs strengthens the analysis enough to compensate for the fact that of course the restriction to GRBs of known redshift reduces the number of candidate GRB neutrinos. And rather remarkably our estimate of the magnitude of the in-vacuo-dispersion effects is fully consistent with what had been found using the previous approach. Our findings are still inconclusive, since their significance is quantified by a $p$-value of little less than $0.01$, but provide motivation for monitoring the accrual of neutrino observations by IceCube and KM3NeT as well as for further refinements of the strategy of analysis here proposed.

2025-01-23, **Free-Streaming Neutrinos and Their Phase Shift in Current and Future CMB Power Spectra**, Gabriele Montefalcone et.al., [2501.13788v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13788v1)

 The cosmic neutrino background and other light relics leave distinct imprints in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through their gravitational influence. Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one second after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe. This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique signature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these relativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to robustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and polarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these spectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase shift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying these methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at about $10\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\sigma$ with additional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise phase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the $1\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally, we establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos and other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and model-agnostic way.

2025-01-23, **Can $Î½$DM interactions solve the $S_8$ discrepancy?**, Lei Zu et.al., [2501.13785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13785v1)

 We present compelling evidence that Dark Matter (DM)-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S\_8 = \sigma\_8\,\sqrt{\Omega\_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing (WL) surveys and leveraging an emulator based on true $N$-body simulations to account for nonlinear corrections, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), but also alleviates the $S\_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with DES Y3 cosmic shear data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ detection of non-zero DM-neutrino interactions, marking a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of dark matter.

 This paper investigates the teleparallel Robertson--Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a scalar field source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity field equations (FEs) for each $k$-parameter value case added by a scalar field to find new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For $k=0$, we find an easy-to-compute $F(T)$ solution formula applicable for any scalar field source. Then, we obtain, for $k=-1$ and $+1$ situations, some new analytical $F(T)$ solutions, only for specific $n$-parameter values and well-determined scalar field cases. We can find by those computations a large number of analytical teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions independent of any scalar potential $V(\phi)$ expression. The $V(\phi)$ independence makes the FE solving and computations easier. The new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications in dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy and quintom models of physical processes.

2025-01-23, **Exploring Various Dark Matter Halo Profiles in Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies within the Framework of Standard Cosmology**, Darshan Kumar et.al., [2501.13861v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13861v1)

 In this paper, we study the rotation curves of the Milky Way galaxy (MW) and Andromeda galaxy (M31) by considering its bulge, disk, and halo components. We model the bulge region by the widely accepted de Vaucouleur's law and the disk region by the well established exponential profile. In order to understand the distribution of dark matter in the halo region, we consider three different dark matter profiles in the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model namely, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Hernquist and Einasto profiles. We use recent datasets of rotation curves of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy. The data consist of rotation velocities of the stars and gas in the galaxy as a function of the radial distance from the center. Using Bayesian statistics, we perform an overall fit including all the components, i.e., bulge, disk and halo with the data. Our results indicate that the NFW and Hernquist profiles are in concordance with the observational data points. However, the Einasto profile poorly explains the behaviour of dark matter in both the galaxies.

2025-01-23, **Dark Photon Polarimetry**, Fiesta Ting Yan Leung et.al., [2501.13849v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13849v1)

 We propose detecting dark photon (DP), a major candidate for wave dark matter, through polarimetry. The DP can modify Maxwell's equations, due to its kinetic mixing with regular photon, inducing an oscillating component in the electromagnetic field. This may leave an imprint in polarimetric light signals, characterised by a distinctive wave pattern in spacetime. As a demonstration, we apply this methodology to investigate ultralight DP produced through the superradiance of supermassive black holes. Then using the polarimetric measurements of the radiation from M87$^\ast$ at the Event Horizon Telescope, we show that all Stokes parameters can serve as a probe in conducting this task. Especially, the absence of significant temporal variation in the linear-polarisation position angle of the M87$^\ast$ images allows us to set novel limits on the photon-DP mixing parameter over the rarely-explored DP mass range of $10^{-22}$--$10^{-20}$eV, with the best reach of $\sim 10^{-8}$ achieved at $\sim 10^{-20.2}$eV. Given the universality of its underlying physics, we expect the DP polarimetry to be broadly applied for the DP detection in laboratory experiments and astronomical observations.

2025-01-23, **A Study on the Line of Sight to Galaxies Detected at Gamma-ray Energies**, Amy Furniss et.al., [2501.13847v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13847v1)

 The large-scale Universal structure comprises strands of dark matter and galaxies with large under-dense volumes known as voids. We measure the fraction of the line of sight that intersects voids for active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This ``voidiness'' fraction is a rudimentary proxy for the density along the line of sight to the galaxies. The voidiness of SDSS-observed quasars (QSOs) is distinctly different from randomly distributed source populations, with a median p-value of $4.6\times10^{-5}$ and $\ll 1\times10^{-7}$, when compared with 500 simulated populations with randomly simulated locations but matching redshifts in the $0.1\leq z<0.4$ and $0.4\leq z < 0.7$ intervals, respectively. A similar comparison of the voidiness for LAT-detected AGN shows median p-values greater than 0.05 in each redshift interval. When comparing the SDSS QSO population to the LAT-detected AGN, we mitigate potential bias from a relationship between redshift and voidiness by comparing the LAT-detected AGN to a ``redshift-matched'' set of SDSS QSOs. The LAT-detected AGN between a redshift of 0.4 and 0.7 show higher voidiness compared to the redshift-matched SDSS QSO populations, with a median p-value of 2.3$\times10^{-5}$, (a $4.1\sigma$ deviation). No deviation is found when comparing the same populations between redshifts of 0.1 and 0.4 (p>0.05). We do not study possible causes of this voidiness difference. It might relate to propagation effects from lower magnetic or radiative background fields within voids or to an environment more favorable for gamma-ray production for AGN near voids.

2025-01-23, **Revealing turbulent Dark Matter via merging of self-Gravitating condensates**, Anirudh Sivakumar et.al., [2501.13689v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13689v1)

 Self-gravitating condensates have been proposed as potential candidates for modelling dark matter. In this paper, we numerically investigate the dynamics of dark matter utilizing the merging of self-gravitating condensates. We have used the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson model and identified distinct turbulent regimes based on the merging speed of the condensate. As a result of collision, we notice the appearance of various dark soliton-mediated instabilities that finally lead to the turbulent state characterized by Kolmogorov-like turbulence scaling \( \varepsilon\_{\mathrm{kin}}^i \sim k^{-5/3} \) in the infrared and \( \varepsilon\_{\mathrm{kin}}^i \sim k^{-3} \) in the ultraviolet regions. The compressible spectrum suggests weak-wave turbulence. The turbulent fluctuations in the condensate cease as the vortices formed via soliton decay are expelled to the condensate's periphery, manifested in the transferring of kinetic energy from incompressible and compressible flows to the quantum pressure energy. We also establish the significant role played by the self-gravitating trap in determining the distribution of compressible kinetic energy and the resulting density waves, which differ markedly from those observed in atomic condensates under harmonic confinement. Our study may offer valuable insights into the merging of binary stars and open new avenues for understanding the structure and dynamics of the dark matter through self-gravitating condensate.

2025-01-23, **Limits on WIMP dark matter with NaI(Tl) crystals in three years of COSINE-100 data**, G. H. Yu et.al., [2501.13665v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13665v1)

 We report limits on WIMP dark matter derived from three years of data collected by the COSINE-100 experiment with NaI(Tl) crystals, achieving an improved energy threshold of 0.7 keV. This lowered threshold enhances sensitivity in the sub-GeV mass range, extending the reach for direct detection of low-mass dark matter. Although no excess of WIMP-like events was observed, the increased sensitivity enabled a model-independent comparison between the expected WIMP signal rate-based on mass limits from our data-and DAMA's reported modulation amplitude. Our findings strongly disfavor the DAMA signal as originating from WIMP interactions, fully excluding DAMA/LIBRA 3$\sigma$ allowed regions and providing enhanced WIMP mass limits by an order of magnitude in the spin-independent model compared to previous results. In the spin-dependent model, cross-section upper limits were obtained in the mass range [0.1-5.0] GeV/c$^2$, with additional sensitivity to sub-GeV WIMPs through the inclusion of the Migdal effect. These results represent substantial progress in low-mass dark matter exploration and reinforce constraints on the longstanding DAMA claim.

2025-01-23, **Forecasted Detection Limits on the (Dark) Matter Density in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries for LISA**, Matthias Daniel et.al., [2501.13601v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13601v1)

 Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are among the most powerful known sources of gravitational waves (GWs). Accordingly, these systems could dominate GW emission in the micro- and millihertz frequency range. Within this domain, SMBHs evolve rapidly and merge with each other. Dynamical friction from stars and gas at the centers of galaxies typically helps to bring together two SMBHs when they are at relatively far separations ($\approx$ kpc $-$ 100 pc), but becomes less efficient at smaller separations. However, dark matter (DM) spikes around SMBHs could enhance dynamical friction at close separations and, thus, shorten the evolution times. In this paper, we simulate the effects of DM spikes on GW signals in the micro- to millihertz frequency range and confirm that the GW signals from SMBHBs with DM spikes can be clearly distinguished from those without any additional matter. Making use of the projected sensitivity curve of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we forecast upper limits for the (dark) matter density for given future SMBHB observations. We then compare these thresholds with the theoretical density profiles expected for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) spikes.

2025-01-23, **A systematic investigation on vector dark matter-nucleus scattering in effective field theories**, Jin-Han Liang et.al., [2501.13501v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13501v1)

 In this paper, we systematically investigate the general spin-one dark matter-nucleus interactions within the framework of effective field theories (EFT). We consider both the nonrelativistic (NR) and the relativistic EFT descriptions of the DM interactions with nucleons and quarks. In the NREFT framework, we present a complete list of NR operators for spin-one DM coupling to nucleons and compute their contributions to the DM response functions. Next, we consider all possible leading-order relativistic EFT operators between DM and light quarks and the photon, and perform NR reductions to match them onto the NREFT. We then derive the nuclear scattering rate from these interactions, and employ recent DM direct detection data (from both the nuclear recoil and the Migdal effect) to constrain all these EFT operators and DM electromagnetic properties. We find the elastic nuclear recoil data (from PandaX-4T, XENONnT, LZ, and DarkSide-50) set stringent bounds on the EFT coefficients for a DM mass above a few GeV while the Migdal effect datasets (from PandaX-4T, XENONnT, and DarkSide-50) can probe the DM mass region as small as 20 MeV. Lastly, we construct a UV complete model that can provide a complex spin-one DM candidate, and at the same time generate DM-quark/photon operators discussed in this work.

2025-01-23, **CosmiXs: Improved spectra for dark matter indirect detection**, Chiara Arina et.al., [2501.13281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13281v1)

 The spectra of stable particles produced from dark matter (DM) are one of the most important ingredients to calculate the fluxes for DM indirect detection experiments. At energies above a few GeV, most of the particles are produced following a complex sequence of phenomena including resonance decays, QED and QCD final-state radiation, radiation of weak gauge bosons, hadronization and hadron decays. In this contribution, we discuss improvements on the calculation of the energy spectra at the source using state-of-the-art tools that include effects that were not taken previously into account. We include helicity information of the particles produced in the annihilation channels, which leads to proper inclusion of electroweak radiation during the entire showering history. These effects are taken into account using the Vincia, which is based on the helicity-dependent antenna shower formalism. Off-shell contributions are also taken into account for annihilation channels into $WW$ and $ZZ$ through the four-body processes into fermions and for DM masses below the gauge boson mass. We also revisit the tune of the Lund fragmentation function parameters in Pythia using LEP data at the $Z$-boson pole. The spectra of cosmic messengers are provided for DM masses between 5 GeV and 100 GeV and are publicly distributed in this \href{https://github.com/ajueid/CosmiXs.git}{GitHub repository}.

2025-01-23, **The bright long-lived Type II SN 2021irp powered by aspherical circumstellar material interaction (II): Estimating the CSM mass and geometry with polarimetry and light curve modeling**, T. M. Reynolds et.al., [2501.13621v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13621v1)

 There is evidence for interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and massive circumstellar material (CSM) in various types of SNe. The mass-ejection mechanisms that produce massive CSM are unclear, and studying interacting SNe and their CSM can shed light on these mechanisms and the final stages of stellar evolution. We aim to study the properties of the CSM in the bright, long-lived, hydrogen-rich (Type II) SN 2021irp, which is interacting with a massive aspherical CSM. We present imaging- and spectro-polarimetric observations of SN 2021irp. By modelling its polarisation and bolometric light curve, we derive the mass and distribution of the CSM. SN 2021irp shows a high intrinsic polarisation of $\sim0.8$%. This high continuum polarisation suggests an aspherical photosphere created by an aspherical CSM interaction. Based on the bolometric light curve evolution and the high polarization, SN 2021irp can be explained as a typical Type II SN interacting with a CSM disk with a corresponding mass-loss rate and half-opening angle of $\sim0.035$ - $0.1$ M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\sim30$ - $50^{\circ}$, respectively. The total CSM mass derived is $\gtrsim 2$ M$\_{\odot}$. We suggest that this CSM disk was created by some process related to binary interaction, and that SN 2021irp is the end product of a typical massive star (i.e. with Zero-Age-Main-Sequence mass of $\sim 8-18$ M$\_{\odot}$) that has a separation and/or mass ratio with its companion star that led to an extreme mass ejection within decades of explosion. Based on the observational properties of SN 2021irp and similar SNe, we propose a general picture for the spectroscopic properties of Type II SNe interacting with a massive disk CSM.

2025-01-23, **The bright long-lived Type II SN 2021irp powered by aspherical circumstellar material interaction (I): Revealing the energy source with photometry and spectroscopy**, T. M. Reynolds et.al., [2501.13619v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13619v1)

 Some core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are too luminous and radiate too much total energy to be powered by the release of thermal energy from the ejecta and radioactive-decay energy from the synthesised $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co. A source of additional power is the interaction between the supernova (SN) ejecta and a massive circumstellar material (CSM). This is an important power source in Type IIn SNe, which show narrow spectral lines arising from the unshocked CSM, but not all interacting SNe show such narrow lines. We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the hydrogen-rich SN 2021irp, which is both luminous, with $M\_{o} < -19.4$ mag, and long-lived, remaining brighter than $M\_{o} = -18$ mag for $\sim$ 250 d. We show that an additional energy source is required to power such a SN, and determine the nature of the source. We also investigate the properties of the pre-existing and newly formed dust associated with the SN. Photometric observations show that the luminosity of the SN is an order of magnitude higher than typical Type II SNe and persists for much longer. We detect a infrared excess attributed to dust emission. Spectra show multi-component line profiles, an Fe II pseudo-continuum, and a lack of absorption lines, all typical features of Type IIn SNe. We detect a narrow (< 85 kms$^{-1}$) P-Cygni profile associated with the unshocked CSM. An asymmetry in emission line profiles indicates dust formation occurring from 250-300 d. Analysis of the SN blackbody radius evolution indicates asymmetry in the shape of the emitting region. We identify the main power source of SN 2021irp as extensive interaction with a massive CSM, and that this CSM is distributed asymmetrically around the progenitor star. The infrared excess is explained with emission from newly formed dust although there is also some evidence of an IR echo from pre-existing dust at early times.
