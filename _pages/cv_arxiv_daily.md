2023-09-21, **Life Cycle Analysis of the GRAND Experiment**, Leidy T. Vargas-Ibáñez et.al., [2309.12282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12282v1)

 The goal of our study is to assess the environmental impact of the installation and use of the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) prototype detection units, based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, and to propose recommendations that contribute to reduce the environmental impacts of the project at later stages. The functional unit, namely the quantified description of the studied system and of the performance requirements it fulfills, is to detect radio signals autonomously during 20 years, with 300 detection units deployed over 200 km^2 in the Gansu province in China (corresponding to the prototype GRANDProto300). We consider four main phases: the extraction of the materials and the production of the detection units (upstream phases), the use and the end-of-life phases (downstream phases), with transportation between each step. An inventory analysis is performed for the seven components of each detection unit, based on transparent assumptions. Most of the inventory data are taken from the Idemat2021 database (Industrial Design & Engineering Materials). Our results show that the components with the highest environmental impact are the antenna structure and the battery. The most pregnant indicators are `resource use', mineral and metals'; `resource use, fossils'; `ionizing radiation, human health'; `climate change'; and `acidification'. Therefore, the actions that we recommend in the first place aim at reducing the impact of these components. They include limiting the mass of the raw material used in the antenna, changing the alloy of the antenna, considering another type of battery with an extended useful life, and the use of recycled materials for construction. As a pioneering study applying the LCA methodology to a large-scale physics experiment, this work can serve as a basis for future assessments by other collaborations.

2023-09-21, **GRB221009A gamma-ray events from non-standard neutrino self-interactions**, Mansi Dhuria et.al., [2309.12264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12264v1)

 The flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos observed by the present generation of neutrino detectors has already indicated a few hints of new physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we show that high-energy gamma-ray observations can also be considered as a complementary probe for unveiling the source of high-energy astrophysical neutrino events and new physics. Recently, the LHAASO collaboration has reported O(5000) gamma-ray events in the energy range between 0.5 TeV -18 TeV from gamma-ray burst GRB221009A within 2000 seconds after the initial outburst. We showed that attenuated high-energy gamma rays can be produced from the interaction of astrophysical neutrinos with CMB neutrinos through non-standard self-interaction of neutrinos mediated by light scalar bosons. The non-standard interaction of neutrinos recently took a lot of attention in cosmology for its role in reducing Hubble tension. We have constrained the parameter space of non-standard self-interacting neutrinos from the flux of photons observed by LHAASO and showed consistency of the same with the resulting parameter space from Hubble tension requirements and other recent constraints from laboratory/cosmology.

2023-09-21, **Primordial Black Hole Neutrinogenesis of Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter**, Muping Chen et.al., [2309.12258v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12258v1)

 We present a new mechanism, the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs), for the cosmological production of sterile neutrinos mixing with Standard Model active neutrinos, contributing to the dark matter. PBH sterile neutrinogenesis can produce a significant relic abundance with arbitrarily small active-sterile mixing. We concentrate on PBHs that matter dominate the Universe and identify the parameter space where decays of these sterile neutrinos could explain the putative 3.5 keV signal or potential signals in future experiments e.g. XRISM or beyond NuSTAR. The association of X-ray and gravitational wave signals is a unique feature of this scenario.

2023-09-21, **Impact of scalar NSI on the neutrino mass hierarchy sensitivity at DUNE, T2HK and T2HKK**, Arnab Sarker et.al., [2309.12249v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12249v1)

 The study of neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) is a well-motivated phenomenological scenario to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The possible scalar coupling of neutrinos ($\nu$) with matter is one of such new physics scenarios which appears as a sub-dominant effect that can impact the $\nu$-oscillations in matter. The presence of scalar NSI introduces an additional contribution directly to the $\nu$-mass matrix in the interaction Hamiltonian and subsequently to the $\nu$-oscillations. This indicates that scalar NSI may have a significant impact on measurements related to $\nu$-oscillations e.g. leptonic CP phase $(\delta\_{CP})$, $\theta\_{23}$ octant and neutrino mass hierarchy (MH). The linear scaling of the effects of scalar NSI with matter density also motivates its exploration in long-baseline (LBL) experiments. In this paper, we study the impact of a scalar-mediated NSI on the MH sensitivity of DUNE, T2HK and T2HKK, which are upcoming LBL experiments. We observe that the MH sensitivities of these experiments are affected by scalar NSI. For certain chosen values of scalar NSI elements, we note an enhancement in the standard MH sensitivities. We then combine the data from DUNE with T2HK/T2HKK to explore possible synergy among these experiments in a wider parameter space. We also observe a significant enhancement in the MH sensitivities for the combined analysis.

2023-09-21, **Search for Continuous and Transient Neutrino Emission Associated with IceCube's Highest-Energy Tracks: An 11-Year Analysis**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2309.12130v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12130v1)

 IceCube alert events are neutrinos with a moderate-to-high probability of having astrophysical origin. In this study, we analyze 11 years of IceCube data and investigate 122 alert events and a selection of high-energy tracks detected between 2009 and the end of 2021, searching for additional continuous and transient neutrino emission within their error regions. We find no evidence for significant continuous neutrino emission from any of the alert event directions. The only locally significant neutrino emission is the transient emission associated with the blazar TXS~0506+056, with a local significance of $ 3 \sigma$, which confirms previous IceCube studies. When correcting for 122 test positions, the global p-value is $0.156$ and is compatible with the background hypothesis. We constrain the total continuous flux emitted from all 122 test positions at 100~TeV to be below $1.2 \times 10^{-15}$~(TeV cm$^2$ s)$^{-1}$ at 90\% confidence assuming an $E^{-2}$ spectrum, which corresponds to 4.5\% of IceCube's astrophysical diffuse flux. Overall, we find no indication that alert events, in general, are linked to lower-energetic continuous or transient neutrino emission.

2023-09-21, **Scotoelectroweak theory**, Phung Van Dong et.al., [2309.12091v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12091v1)

 We argue that the higher weak isospin $SU(3)\_L$ manifestly unifies dark matter and normal matter in its isomultiplets for which dark matter carries a conserved dark charge while normal matter does not. The resultant gauge symmetry is given by $SU(3)\_C\otimes SU(3)\_L \otimes U(1)\_X\otimes U(1)\_G$, where the first factor is the color group, while the rest defines a theory of scotoelectroweak in which $X$ and $G$ determine electric charge $Q=T\_3-1/\sqrt{3}T\_8+X$ and dark charge $D=-2/\sqrt{3}T\_3+G$. This setup provides both appropriate scotogenic neutrino masses and dark matter stability as preserved by a residual dark parity $P\_D=(-1)^D$. Interpretation of the dark charge is further discussed, given that $SU(3)\_L$ is broken at very high energy scale.

2023-09-21, **Outflow energy and black-hole spin evolution in collapsar scenarios**, Masaru Shibata et.al., [2309.12086v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12086v1)

 We explore the collapsar scenario for long gamma-ray bursts by performing axisymmetric neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations in full general relativity for the first time. In this paper, we pay particular attention to the outflow energy and the evolution of the black-hole spin. We show that for a strong magnetic field with an aligned field configuration initially given, a jet is launched by magnetohydrodynamical effects before the formation of a disk and a torus, and after the jet launch, the matter accretion onto the black hole is halted by the strong magnetic pressure, leading to the spin-down of the black hole due to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. The spin-down timescale depends strongly on the magnetic-field strength initially given because the magnetic-field strength on the black-hole horizon, which is determined by the mass infall rate at the jet launch, depends strongly on the initial condition, although the total jet-outflow energy appears to be huge $>10^{53}$ erg depending only weakly on the initial field strength and configuration. For the models in which the magnetic-field configuration is not suitable for quick jet launch, a torus is formed and after a long-term magnetic-field amplification, a jet can be launched. For this case, the matter accretion onto the black hole continues even after the jet launch and black-hole spin-down is not found. We also find that the jet launch is often accompanied with the powerful explosion of the entire star with the explosion energy of order $10^{52}$ erg by magnetohydrodynamical effects. We discuss an issue of the overproduced energy for the early-jet-launch models.

2023-09-21, **Constructing the Hyper-Kamiokande Computing Model in the Build Up to Data Taking**, Sophie King et.al., [2309.11844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11844v1)

 Hyper-Kamiokande is a next-generation multi-purpose neutrino experiment with a primary focus on constraining CP-violation in the lepton sector. It features a diverse science programme that includes neutrino oscillation studies, astrophysics, neutrino cross-section measurements, and searches for physics beyond the standard model, such as proton decay. Building on its predecessor, Super-Kamiokande, the Hyper-Kamiokande far detector has a total volume approximately 5 times larger and is estimated to collect nearly 2PB of data per year. The experiment will also include both on- and off-axis near detectors, including an Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector. To manage the significant demands relating to the data from these detectors, and the associated Monte Carlo simulations for a range of physics studies, an efficient and scalable distributed computing model is essential. This model leverages Worldwide LHC Grid computing infrastructure and utilises the GridPP DIRAC instance for both workload management and for file cataloguing. In this report we forecast the computing requirements for the Hyper-K experiment, estimated to reach around 35PB (per replica) and 8,700 CPU cores (~ 100,000 HS06) by 2036. We outline the resources, tools, and workflow in place to satisfy this demand.

2023-09-20, **Heavy neutral leptons from kaons in effective field theory**, Rebeca Beltrán et.al., [2309.11546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11546v1)

 In the framework of the low-energy effective theory containing in addition to the Standard Model fields heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), we compute the decay rates of neutral and charged kaons into HNLs. We consider both lepton-number-conserving and lepton-number-violating four-fermion operators, taking into account also the contribution of active-heavy neutrino mixing. Assuming that the produced HNLs are long-lived, we perform simulations and calculate the sensitivities of future long-lived-particle (LLP) detectors at the high-luminosity LHC to the considered scenario. When applicable, we also recast the existing bounds on the minimal mixing case obtained by NA62, T2K, and PS191. Our findings show that for some of the effective operators considered the future LLP detectors, in particular, MATHUSLA and ANUBIS, will probe (i) new parts of the parameter space spanned by HNL mass and active-heavy neutrino mixing, and (ii) new-physics scales in excess of $2000$ TeV.

2023-09-20, **The framework of the auxiliary group: two birds with one stone**, R. Krishnan et.al., [2309.11542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11542v1)

 Flavon models in the literature assume constraints on the components of the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of flavons, and typically, these constraints are not fully determined by the residual symmetry group of the set of vevs. This poses a problem because the general potential of the flavons cannot have a minimum that leads to such constraints unless additional mechanisms involving supersymmetry, extra dimensions etc., are invoked. In this paper, we show that the framework of the auxiliary group naturally results in vevs satisfying the required constraints, and using it, we construct a type-1 seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos, which predicts the ratio of the light neutrino masses $m\_2/m\_3=(\sqrt{2}-1)/(\sqrt{2}+1)$ and $\text{TM}\_1$ mixing with $\sin\theta\_{13}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sin\frac{\pi}{12}$ and $\sin\delta\_\text{CP}=-1$. Our framework posits auxiliary group transformations which act on the flavons but not on the fermions. We construct the general renormalizable potential without invoking additional mechanisms and show that it has a minimum that leads to the required constraints.

2023-09-20, **Visible in the laboratory and invisible in cosmology: decaying sterile neutrinos**, Kevork N. Abazajian et.al., [2309.11492v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11492v1)

 The expansion history and thermal physical process that happened in the early Universe before big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains relatively unconstrained by observations. Low reheating temperature universes with normalcy temperatures of $T\_\mathrm{RH}\sim 2\,\mathrm{MeV}$ remain consistent with all observations, and accommodate several new physics scenarios that would normally be constrained by high-temperature reheating models, including massive sterile neutrinos. We explore such scenarios' production of keV scale sterile neutrinos and their resulting constraints from cosmological observations. The parameter space for massive sterile neutrinos is much less constrained than in high-$T\_\mathrm{RH}$ thermal histories, though several cosmological constraints remain. Such parameter space is the target of several current and upcoming laboratory experiments such as TRISTAN (KATRIN), HUNTER, MAGNETO-$\nu$, and PTOLEMY. Cosmological constraints remain stringent for stable keV-scale sterile neutrinos. However, we show that sterile neutrinos with a dark decay to radiation through a $Z^\prime$ or a new scalar are largely unconstrained by cosmology. In addition, this mechanism of sterile neutrinos with large mixing may provide a solution to the Hubble tension. We find that keV-scale sterile neutrinos are therefore one of the best probes of the untested pre-BBN era in the early Universe and could be seen in upcoming laboratory experiments.

2023-09-20, **Searching for dark neutrinos through exotic Higgs decays at the ILC**, Simon Thor et.al., [2309.11254v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11254v1)

 In this study we investigate the feasibility of detecting heavy dark neutrinos ($N\_d$) through exotic Higgs decays at the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC), specifically in the channel of $e^+ e^- \to qq~ H$ with $H\to \nu N\_d \to \nu~lW \to \nu l~qq$. Analyses based on full detector simulations of the ILD are performed at the center-of-mass energy of 250 GeV for two different beam polarization schemes with a total integrated luminosity of 2 $\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$. A range of dark neutrino masses between the $Z$ boson and Higgs boson masses are studied. The $2\sigma$ significance reach for the joint branching ratio of $BR(H\to\nu N\_d)\cdot BR(N\_d\to lW)$ is about 0.1%, nearly independent of the dark neutrino masses, while the $5\sigma$ discovery is possible at a branching ratio of $0.3\%$. Interpreting these results in terms of constraints on the mixing parameters $\|\varepsilon\_{id}\|^2$ between SM neutrinos and the dark neutrino, it is expected to have a factor of 10 improvement from current constraints.

2023-09-20, **Interplay of type-I and type-II seesaw in neutrinoless double beta decay in left-right symmetric model**, Vivek Banerjee et.al., [2309.11105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11105v1)

 The left-right symmetric models (LRSM) generally include type-I and type-II induced seesaw mass as a hybrid mass for the light-active neutrinos. Assuming a particular form of Dirac-type coupling, the Majorana-type coupling present in the seesaw mass formula can be expressed in terms of low-energy neutrino oscillation observables and vacuum expectation values (vevs) of the scalar fields present in the model. The Majorana-type coupling thus admits eight different solutions by considering the interplay of type-I and type-II terms dominate the light neutrino mass. We study the role of all eight solutions in the lepton number violating neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) process. In LRSM, the right-handed neutrinos, triplet scalars, and gauge bosons of the left and right sectors act as mediators of new contributions to the $0\nu\beta\beta$ process. As a result, the effective mass of electron neutrino appearing in the decay width would be a function of $v\_R$ (vev of the Higgs triplet of the right sector) along with other parameters of the model, through the masses of the new contributions. The energy scale, $v\_R$ can be considered as the new physics scale which allows exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. Considering the present and future sensitivity of searches of $0\nu\beta\beta$, we study the role of eight different solutions of the Majorana coupling matrix. In our study, the inverted hierarchy of light neutrino masses is disfavored for all solutions keeping future sensitivity of effective mass in the picture, if the lightest mass of active neutrinos is below $0.001$ eV. Also, our study shows a possibility of new physics contributions saturating the experimental bound on effective mass for $v\_R$ in the range of $10$ TeV for two particular solutions of the Majorana coupling matrix.

2023-09-21, **Constraining dark energy cosmologies with spatial curvature using Supernovae JWST forecasting**, Pablo M. Maldonado Alonso et.al., [2309.12292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12292v1)

 Recent cosmological tensions, in particular, to infer the local value of the Hubble constant $H\_0$, have developed new independent techniques to constrain cosmological parameters in several cosmologies. Moreover, even when the concordance Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been well constrained with local observables, its physics has shown deviations from a flat background. Therefore, to explore a possible deviation from a flat $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the $H\_0$ value in tension with other techniques, in this paper we study new cosmological constraints in spatial curvature dark energy models. Additionally, to standard current Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) catalogs, we extend the empirical distance ladder method through an SNIa sample using the capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to forecast SNIa up to $z \sim 6$, with information on the star formation rates at high redshift. Furthermore, we found that our constraints provide an improvement in the statistics associated with $\Omega\_{m}$ when combining SNIa Pantheon and SNIa Pantheon+ catalogs with JW forecasting data.

2023-09-21, **Dark Sector Effective Field Theory**, Jin-Han Liang et.al., [2309.12166v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12166v1)

 We introduce the effective field theory of two different light dark particles interacting with the standard model (SM) light states in a single vertex, termed dark sector effective field theory (DSEFT). We focus on the new light particles with spin up to 1 and being real in essence, namely, new real scalars $\phi$ and $S$, Majorana fermions $\chi$ and $\psi$, and real vectors $X\_\mu$ and $V\_\mu$. In the framework of low energy effective field theory with QED and QCD symmetry, the DSEFT can be classified into six categories, including the scalar-scalar-SM ($\phi S$-SM), fermion-fermion-SM ($\chi\psi$-SM), vector-vector-SM ($X V$-SM), scalar-fermion-SM ($\phi \chi$-SM), scalar-vector-SM ($\phi X$-SM), and fermion-vector-SM ($\chi X$-SM) cases. For each case, we construct the effective operator basis up to canonical dimension 7, which will cover most interesting phenomenology at low energy. As a phenomenological example, we investigate the longstanding neutron lifetime anomaly through the neutron dark decay modes $n \to \chi \phi \text{ or } \chi X$ from the effective interactions in the fermion-scalar-SM or fermion-vector-SM case. When treating the light fermion as a dark matter candidate, we also explore the constraints from DM-neutron annihilation signal at Super-Kamiokande. We find the neutron dark decay in each scenario can accommodate the anomaly, at the same time, without contradicting with the Super-Kamiokande limit.

2023-09-21, **Tunable Rectangular Resonant Cavities for Axion Haloscopes**, Ben T. McAllister et.al., [2309.12098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12098v1)

 Axions are a compelling dark matter candidate, and one of the primary techniques employed to search for them is the axion haloscope, in which a resonant cavity is deployed inside a strong magnetic field so that some of the surrounding axions may convert into photons via the inverse Primakoff effect and become trapped inside the resonator. Resonant cavity design is critical to the sensitivity of a haloscope, and several geometries have been utilised and proposed. Here we consider a relatively simple concept - a rectangular resonant cavity with a tunable wall - and compare it to the standard tuning rod-type resonators employed in the field. We find that the rectangular cavities support similar modes to cylindrical tuning rod cavities, and have some advantages in terms of axion sensitivity and practicality, particularly when moving to higher frequencies which are of great and growing interest in the international axion dark matter community.

2023-09-21, **Dark Matter Annihilation via Breit-Wigner Enhancement with Heavier Mediator**, Yu Cheng et.al., [2309.12043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12043v1)

 We propose a new scenario that both the dark matter freeze-out in the early Universe and its possible annihilation for indirect detection around a supermassive black hole are enhanced by a Breit-Wigner resonance. With the mediator mass larger than the total initial dark matter mass, this annihilation is almost forbidden at late times. Thus, the stringent cosmic microwave background and indirect detection constraints do not apply. However, a supermassive black hole can accelerate the dark matter particles to reactivate this resonant annihilation whose subsequent decay to photons leaves a unique signal. The running Fermi-LAT and the future COSI satellites can test this scenario.

2023-09-21, **Seeing dark matter via acceleration radiation**, Syed Masood A. S. Bukhari et.al., [2309.11958v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11958v1)

 Notwithstanding an impressive $\sim 27\%$ share of the total energy budget of our Universe, dark matter (DM) has by far remained elusive for any direct observations. Given its ubiquity, there is a genuine expectation that astrophysical black holes (BHs) surrounded by DM should leave imprints on the gravitational waves germinating from BH mergers. Theoretical models of DM offer a landscape of possibilities. Of these, perfect fluid dark matter (PDFM) is a novel candidate model which has been of considerable interest recently. In this Letter, employing the well-known \textit{quantum optical} approach, we investigate the possibility of catching DM signatures via acceleration radiation emitted by a detector (e.g. an atom) falling freely within a PFDM-surrounded Schwarzschild BH.   The setup comprises a Casimir-type apparatus where the detector interacts with the field and excites thereby in a typical Unruh manner. We observe that our DM candidate, though offering contributions to the spacetime geometry on a classical footing, could however leave its potential quantum imprints in the radiation flux. Specifically, one notes that compared to a pure Schwarzschild BH, PFDM can markedly reduce particle emission as long as its density remains below a critical value, and vice versa. This novel study, bringing DM into Casimir physics, may possibly provide insights into the future table-top experiments in analogue gravity paradigm.

2023-09-21, **Electrons densities and plasma mass densities observed by pulsar dispersion in different locations of our galaxy**, Y. Ben-Aryeh et.al., [2309.11905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11905v1)

 Electrons densities in different locations of our galaxy are obtained in pulsar astronomy by dividing the dispersion Measure by the distance of the pulsar to Earth. In order that such measurements will be reliable these distances should be obtained by methods which are independent of the electron density model and the results of such measurements are used in the present article to derive plasma mass densities. Our main analysis is based on the idea that the pulsars measurements are obtained for completely ionized hydrogen plasma. We use the electrons densities to derive the plasma mass densities and compare it with dark matter mass densities which are found to be much larger. But some factors which may reduce this difference are discussed. The properties of the low-density plasma are analyzed by using Saha equation.

2023-09-21, **The Hydrostatic Mass of A478: Discrepant Results From Chandra, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton**, Cicely Potter et.al., [2309.11743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11743v1)

 Galaxy clusters are the most recently formed and most massive, gravitationally bound structures in the universe. The number of galaxy clusters formed is highly dependent on cosmological parameters, such as the dark matter density, $\sigma\_8$, and $\Omega\_m$. The number density is a function of the cluster mass, which can be estimated from the density and temperature profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM) under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. The temperature of the plasma, hence its mass, is calculated from the X-ray spectra. However, effective area calibration uncertainties in the soft band result in significantly different temperature measurements from various space-based X-ray telescopes. NuSTAR is potentially less susceptible to these issues than Chandra and XMM-Newton, having larger effective area, particularly at higher energies, enabling high precision temperature measurements. In this work, we present analyses of Chandra, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton data of Abell 478 to investigate the nature of this calibration discrepancy. We find that NuSTAR temperatures are on average $\sim$11% lower than that of Chandra, and XMM-Newton temperatures are on average $\sim$5% lower than that of NuSTAR. This results in a NuSTAR mass at $r\_{2500,Chandra}$ of $M\_{2500,NuSTAR}=3.39^{+0.07}\_{-0.07}\times10^{14}$ $M\_{\odot}$, which is $\sim$10% lower than that of $M\_{2500,Chandra}$ and $\sim$4% higher than $M\_{2500,XMM-Newton}$.

2023-09-20, **Fast shimming algorithm based on Bayesian optimization for magnetic resonance based dark matter search**, Julian Walter et.al., [2309.11614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11614v1)

 The sensitivity and accessible mass range of magnetic resonance searches for axionlike dark matter depends on the homogeneity of applied magnetic fields. Optimizing homogeneity through shimming requires exploring a large parameter space which can be prohibitively time consuming. We have automated the process of tuning the shim-coil currents by employing an algorithm based on Bayesian optimization. This method is especially suited for applications where the duration of a single optimization step prohibits exploring the parameter space extensively or when there is no prior information on the optimal operation point. Using the Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment (CASPEr)-gradient low-field apparatus, we show that for our setup this method converges after approximately 30 iterations to a sub-10 parts-per-million field homogeneity which is desirable for our dark matter search.

2023-09-20, **The Quintuplet Annihilation Spectrum**, Matthew Baumgart et.al., [2309.11562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11562v1)

 We extend the Effective Field Theory of Heavy Dark Matter to arbitrary odd representations of SU(2) and incorporate the effects of bound states. This formalism is then deployed to compute the gamma-ray spectrum for a 5 of SU(2): quintuplet dark matter. Except at isolated values of the quintuplet mass, the bound state contribution to hard photons with energy near the dark-matter mass is at the level of a few percent compared to that from direct annihilation. Further, compared to smaller representations, such as the triplet wino, the quintuplet can exhibit a strong variation in the shape of the spectrum as a function of mass. Using our results, we forecast the fate of the thermal quintuplet, which has a mass of $\sim$13.6 TeV. We find that existing H.E.S.S. data should be able to significantly test the scenario, however, the final word on this canonical model of minimal dark matter will likely be left to the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).

2023-09-20, **The many tensions with dark-matter based models and implications on the nature of the Universe**, Pavel Kroupa et.al., [2309.11552v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11552v1)

 (Abridged) Fundamental tensions between observations and dark-matter based cosmological models have emerged. This updated review has two purposes: to explore new tensions that have arisen in recent years, compounding the unresolved tensions from previous studies, and to use the shortcomings of the current theory to guide the development of a successful model. Tensions arise in view of the profusion of thin disk galaxies, the pronounced symmetrical structure of the Local Group of Galaxies, the common occurrence of planes of satellite systems, the El Gordo and Bullet galaxy clusters, significant matter inhomogeneities on scales much larger than 100 Mpc, and the observed rapid formation of galaxies and super-massive black holes at redshifts larger than 7. Given the nature of the tensions, the real Universe needs to be described by a model in which gravitation is effectively stronger than Einsteinian/Newtonian gravitation at accelerations below Milgrom's acceleration scale. The promising nuHDM model, anchored on Milgromian dynamics but keeping the standard expansion history with dark energy, solves many of the above tensions. However galaxy formation appears to occur too late in this model, model galaxy clusters reach too large masses, and the mass function of model galaxy clusters is too flat and thus top-heavy in comparison to the observed mass function. Classes of models that reassess inflation, dark energy and the role of the CMB should be explored.

2023-09-20, **Unveiling dark forces with the Large Scale Structure of the Universe**, Salvatore Bottaro et.al., [2309.11496v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11496v1)

 Cosmology offers opportunities to test Dark Matter independently of its interactions with the Standard Model. We study the imprints of long-range forces acting solely in the dark sector on the distribution of galaxies, the so-called Large Scale Structure (LSS). We derive the strongest constraint on such forces from a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Along the way we consistently develop, for the first time, the Effective Field Theory of LSS in the presence of new dynamics in the dark sector. We forecast that future surveys will improve the current bound by an order of magnitude.

 Quantum amplification is recognized as a key resource for precision measurements. However, most conventional paradigms employ an ensemble of independent particles that usually limit the performance of quantum amplification in gain, spectral linewidth, etc. Here we demonstrate a new signal amplification using cooperative 129Xe nuclear spins embedded within a feedback circuit, where the noble-gas spin coherence time is enhanced by at least one order of magnitude. Using such a technique, magnetic field can be substantially pre-enhanced by more than three orders and is in situ readout with an embedded 87Rb magnetometer. We realize an ultrahigh magnetic sensitivity of 4.0 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ that surpasses the photon-shot noise and even below the spin-projection noise of the embedded atomic magnetometer, allowing for exciting applications including searches for dark matter with sensitivity well beyond supernova constraints. Our findings extend the physics of quantum amplification to cooperative spin systems and can be generalized to a wide variety of existing sensors, enabling a new class of cooperative quantum sensors.

 The search for dark-matter (DM) candidates at high-energy colliders is one of the most promising avenues to understand the nature of this elusive component of the universe. Several searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have strongly constrained a wide range of simplified models. The combination of the bounds from the LHC with direct-detection experiments exclude the most minimal scalar singlet DM model. To address this, Lepton portal DM models are suitable candidates where DM is predominantly produced at lepton colliders since the DM candidate only interacts with the lepton sector through a mediator that carries a lepton number. In this work, we analyse the production of DM pairs in association with a Higgs boson decaying into two bottom quarks at future muon colliders in the framework of the minimal lepton portal DM model. It is found that the usual cut-based analysis methods fail to probe heavy DM masses for both the resolved (where the decay products of the Higgs boson can be resolved as two well-separated small-$R$ jets) and the merged (where the Higgs boson is clustered as one large-$R$ jet). We have then built a search strategy based on Boosted-Decision Trees (BDTs). We have optimised the hyperparameters of the BDT model to both have a high signal-to-background ratio and to avoid overtraining effects. We have found very important enhancements of the signal significance with respect to the cut-based analysis by factors of $8$--$50$ depending on the regime (resolved or merged) and the benchmark points. Using this BDT model on a one-dimensional parameter space scan we found that future muon colliders with $\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV and ${\cal L} = 1~{\rm ab}^{-1}$ can exclude DM masses up to $1$ TeV at the $95\%$ CL.

 We report a first detection, at very high significance ($25\sigma$), of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and the diffuse X-ray background, using data from the Dark Energy Survey and the ROSAT satellite. The X-ray cross-correlation signal is sensitive to the distribution of the surrounding gas in dark matter haloes. This allows us to use our measurements to place constraints on key physical parameters that determine the impact of baryonic effects in the matter power spectrum. In particular, we determine the mass of haloes in which feedback has expelled half of their gas content on average to be $\log\_{10}(M\_c/M\_\odot)=13.643^{+0.081}\_{-0.12}$, and the polytropic index of the gas to be $\Gamma = 1.231^{+0.015}\_{-0.011}$. This represents a first step in the direct use of X-ray cross-correlations to obtain improved constraints on cosmology and the physics of the intergalactic gas.

 The detectability of light dark matter in direct detection experiments is limited by the small kinetic energy of the recoiling targets. Thus, scenarios where dark matter is boosted to relativistic velocities provide a useful tactic to constrain sub-GeV dark matter particles. Of the possible dark matter boosting mechanisms, cosmic-ray upscattering is an appealing paradigm as it doesn't require any additional assumptions beyond dark matter coupling to nucleons or electrons. However, detectable signals are obtained only with relatively large cross sections which, in turn, can only be realized with large couplings, light mediators or composite dark matter. In this work we consider a general set of light mediators that couple dark matter to hadrons. Using data from Borexino, XENON1T, LZ and Super-K, we show that existing constraints on such mediators preclude appreciable cosmic-ray dark matter upscattering. This finding highlights the limited applicability of cosmic-ray upscattering constraints and suggests they only be used in model-dependent studies.

 Recent cosmological tensions, in particular, to infer the local value of the Hubble constant $H\_0$, have developed new independent techniques to constrain cosmological parameters in several cosmologies. Moreover, even when the concordance Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been well constrained with local observables, its physics has shown deviations from a flat background. Therefore, to explore a possible deviation from a flat $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the $H\_0$ value in tension with other techniques, in this paper we study new cosmological constraints in spatial curvature dark energy models. Additionally, to standard current Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) catalogs, we extend the empirical distance ladder method through an SNIa sample using the capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to forecast SNIa up to $z \sim 6$, with information on the star formation rates at high redshift. Furthermore, we found that our constraints provide an improvement in the statistics associated with $\Omega\_{m}$ when combining SNIa Pantheon and SNIa Pantheon+ catalogs with JW forecasting data.

 General relativistic instability supernovae at ~10 < z < ~15 are predicted to be observed as red faint point sources, and they can be detected only in the reddest filters in JWST/NIRCam (F444W and F356W). They should be observed as persistent point sources with little flux variations for a couple of decades because of time dilation. We search for static point sources detected only in the F444W filter or only in the F444W and F356W filters in the early JWST deep field data. No real point source of such kind is identified. Therefore, the general relativistic instability supernova rate at ~10 < z < ~15 is constrained to be less than ~ 8e-7 Mpc-3 yr-1 for the first time.

2023-09-21, **Cosmology with multiple galaxies**, Chaitanya Chawak et.al., [2309.12048v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12048v1)

 Recent works have discovered a relatively tight correlation between $\Omega\_{\rm m}$ and properties of individual simulated galaxies. Because of this, it has been shown that constraints on $\Omega\_{\rm m}$ can be placed using the properties of individual galaxies while accounting for uncertainties on astrophysical processes such as feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei. In this work, we quantify whether using the properties of multiple galaxies simultaneously can tighten those constraints. For this, we train neural networks to perform likelihood-free inference on the value of two cosmological parameters ($\Omega\_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma\_8$) and four astrophysical parameters using the properties of several galaxies from thousands of hydrodynamic simulations of the CAMELS project. We find that using properties of more than one galaxy increases the precision of the $\Omega\_{\rm m}$ inference. Furthermore, using multiple galaxies enables the inference of other parameters that were poorly constrained with one single galaxy. We show that the same subset of galaxy properties are responsible for the constraints on $\Omega\_{\rm m}$ from one and multiple galaxies. Finally, we quantify the robustness of the model and find that without identifying the model range of validity, the model does not perform well when tested on galaxies from other galaxy formation models.

 This thesis focuses on X-ray polarimetry and its recent resurgence due to the NASA/ASI Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission launched in December 2021. It aims to address two critical tasks: in-orbit calibrations and observing faint extended celestial sources. For in-orbit calibrations, IXPE carries polarized and unpolarized calibration sources because known celestial sources, like the Crab Nebula, aren't suitable due to variability. Tests were performed on Flight Models of these calibration sources, ensuring their functionality in thermal vacuum when combined with IXPE detectors. Concerning observing faint extended sources, instrumental and diffuse backgrounds pose challenges. The impact of various background sources, such as instrumental, diffuse Galactic plane emission, and cosmic X-ray background, on X-ray polarimetry of faint, extended sources was examined. The feasibility study also covered observing two extended sources: the Tycho supernova remnant and the molecular clouds of the Sgr A complex. Monte Carlo simulations were employed to evaluate the detectability of polarization. Results show that the on-board calibration system will assess and verify the GPD's functionality in orbit. Background mitigation techniques will be required for faintest extended sources. For sources like Cas A, Tycho, and PSW MSH 15-52, background effects are negligible. In conclusion, the IXPE mission opens up spatially resolved X-ray polarimetry, enabling the determination of polarization angles and degrees. Preliminary data after launch indicates that on-board calibration sources are performing as expected, and imaging capabilities meet requirements. This research is essential for advancing X-ray polarimetry and understanding high-energy celestial sources.

2023-09-21, **Viscous fluid dynamics with decaying vacuum energy density**, C. P. Singh et.al., [2309.12018v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12018v1)

 In this work, we investigate the dynamics of bulk viscous models with decaying vacuum energy density (VED) in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre- Robertson-walker (FLRW) spacetime. We particularly are interested to study the viscous model which considers first order deviation from equilibrium, i.e., the Eckart theory. In the first part, using the different forms of the bulk viscous coefficient, we find the main cosmological parameters, like Hubble parameter, scale factor, deceleration parameter and equation of state parameter analytically. We discuss some cosmological consequences of the evolutions and dynamics of the different viscous models with decaying VED. We examine the linear perturbation growth in the context of the bulk viscous model with decaying VED to see if it survives this further level of scrutiny. The second part of the work is devoted to constrain the viscous model of the form $\zeta \propto H$, where $\zeta$ is the bulk viscous coefficient and $H$ is the Hubble parameter, using three different combinations of data from type Ia supernovae (Pantheon), $H(z)$ (cosmic chronometers), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and $f(z)\sigma\_8(z)$ measurements with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We show that the considered model is compatible with the cosmological probes, and the $\Lambda$CDM recovered in late-time of the evolution of the Universe. Finally, we obtain selection information criteria (AIC and BIC) to study the stability of the models.

2023-09-21, **Extragalactic Test of General Relativity from Strong Gravitational Lensing by using Artificial Neural Networks**, Jing-Yu Ran et.al., [2309.11810v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11810v1)

 This study aims to test the validity of general relativity (GR) on kiloparsec scales by employing a newly compiled galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing (SGL) sample. We utilize the distance sum rule within the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric to obtain cosmology-independent constraints on both the parameterized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma\_{\rm PPN}$ and the spatial curvature $\Omega\_{k}$, which overcomes the circularity problem induced by the presumption of a cosmological model grounded in GR. To calibrate the distances in the SGL systems, we introduce a novel nonparametric approach, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to reconstruct a smooth distance--redshift relation from the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae. Our results show that $\gamma\_{\rm PPN}=1.16\_{-0.12}^{+0.15}$ and $\Omega\_k=0.89\_{-1.00}^{+1.97}$, indicating a spatially flat universe with the conservation of GR (i.e., $\Omega\_k=0$ and $\gamma\_{\rm PPN}=1$) is basically supported within $1\sigma$ confidence level. Assuming a zero spatial curvature, we find $\gamma\_{\rm PPN}=1.09\_{-0.10}^{+0.11}$, representing an agreement with the prediction of 1 from GR to a 9.6\% precision. If we instead assume GR holds (i.e., $\gamma\_{\rm PPN}=1$), the curvature parameter constraint can be further improved to be $\Omega\_k=0.11\_{-0.47}^{+0.78}$. These resulting constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in testing GR on galactic scales by combining observations of strong lensing and the distance--redshift relation reconstructed by ANN.

2023-09-20, **Distances to Recent Near-Earth Supernovae From Geological and Lunar 60Fe**, Adrienne F. Ertel et.al., [2309.11604v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11604v1)

 Near-Earth supernova blasts which engulf the solar system have left traces of their ejecta in the geological and lunar records. There is now a wealth of data on live radioactive ${}^{60}$Fe pointing to a supernova at 3 Myr ago, as well as the recent discovery of an event at 7 Myr ago. We use the available measurements to evaluate the distances to these events. For the better analyzed supernova at 3 Myr, samples include deep-sea sediments, ferromanganese crusts, and lunar regolith; we explore the consistency among and across these measurements, which depends sensitively on the uptake of iron in the samples as well as possible anisotropies in the ${}^{60}$Fe fallout. There is also significant uncertainty in the astronomical parameters needed for these calculations. We take the opportunity to perform a parameter study on the effects that the ejected ${}^{60}$Fe mass from a core-collapse supernova and the fraction of dust that survives the remnant have on the resulting distance. We find that with an ejected ${}^{60}$Fe mass of $3\times10^{-5} M\_\odot$ and a dust fraction of 10%, the distance range for the supernova 3 Myr ago is $D \sim 20 - 140$ pc, with the most likely range between $50 - 65$ pc. Using the same astrophysical parameters, the distance for the supernova at 7 Myr ago is $D \sim 110$ pc. We close with a brief discussion of geological and astronomical measurements that can improve these results.

2023-09-20, **From Out of the Blue: Swift Links 2002es-like, 2003fg-like, and Early-Time Bump Type Ia Supernovae**, W. B. Hoogendam et.al., [2309.11563v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11563v1)

 We collect a sample of 42 SNe Ia with Swift UV photometry and well-measured early-time light curve rises and find that 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia have different pre-peak UV color evolutions compared to normal SNe Ia and other spectroscopic subtypes. Specifically, 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia are cleanly separated from other SNe Ia subtypes by UVM2-UVW1>=1.0~mag at 10 days prior to B-band maximum. Furthermore, the SNe Ia that exhibit non-monotonic bumps in their rising light curves, to date, consist solely of 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia. We also find that SNe Ia with two-component power-law rises are more luminous than SNe Ia with single-component power-law rises at pre-peak epochs. Given the similar UV colors, along with other observational similarities, we discuss a possible progenitor scenario that places 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia along a continuum and may explain the unique UV colors, early-time bumps, and other observational similarities between these objects. Ultimately, further observations of both subtypes, especially in the near-infrared, are critical for constraining models of these peculiar thermonuclear explosions.

 Matched-filtering detection techniques for gravitational-wave (GW) signals in ground-based interferometers rely on having well-modeled templates of the GW emission. Such techniques have been traditionally used in searches for compact binary coalescences (CBCs), and have been employed in all known GW detections so far. However, interesting science cases aside from compact mergers do not yet have accurate enough modeling to make matched filtering possible, including core-collapse supernovae and sources where stochasticity may be involved. Therefore the development of techniques to identify sources of these types is of significant interest. In this paper, we present a method of anomaly detection based on deep recurrent autoencoders to enhance the search region to unmodeled transients. We use a semi-supervised strategy that we name Gravitational Wave Anomalous Knowledge (GWAK). While the semi-supervised nature of the problem comes with a cost in terms of accuracy as compared to supervised techniques, there is a qualitative advantage in generalizing experimental sensitivity beyond pre-computed signal templates. We construct a low-dimensional embedded space using the GWAK method, capturing the physical signatures of distinct signals on each axis of the space. By introducing signal priors that capture some of the salient features of GW signals, we allow for the recovery of sensitivity even when an unmodeled anomaly is encountered. We show that regions of the GWAK space can identify CBCs, detector glitches and also a variety of unmodeled astrophysical sources.

 Quantum amplification is recognized as a key resource for precision measurements. However, most conventional paradigms employ an ensemble of independent particles that usually limit the performance of quantum amplification in gain, spectral linewidth, etc. Here we demonstrate a new signal amplification using cooperative 129Xe nuclear spins embedded within a feedback circuit, where the noble-gas spin coherence time is enhanced by at least one order of magnitude. Using such a technique, magnetic field can be substantially pre-enhanced by more than three orders and is in situ readout with an embedded 87Rb magnetometer. We realize an ultrahigh magnetic sensitivity of 4.0 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ that surpasses the photon-shot noise and even below the spin-projection noise of the embedded atomic magnetometer, allowing for exciting applications including searches for dark matter with sensitivity well beyond supernova constraints. Our findings extend the physics of quantum amplification to cooperative spin systems and can be generalized to a wide variety of existing sensors, enabling a new class of cooperative quantum sensors.

 We use the distance sum rule (DSR) method to constrain the spatial curvature of the Universe with a large sample of 161 strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems, whose distances are calibrated from the Pantheon compilation of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using deep learning. To investigate the possible influence of mass model of the lens galaxy on constraining the curvature parameter $\Omega\_k$, we consider three different lens models. Results show that a flat Universe is supported in the singular isothermal sphere (SIS) model with the parameter $\Omega\_k=0.049^{+0.147}\_{-0.125}$. While in the power-law (PL) model, a closed Universe is preferred at $\sim 3\sigma$ confidence level, with the parameter $\Omega\_k=-0.245^{+0.075}\_{-0.071}$. In extended power-law (EPL) model, the 95$\%$ confidence level upper limit of $\Omega\_k$ is $<0.011$. As for the parameters of the lens models, constrains on the three models indicate that the mass profile of the lens galaxy could not be simply described by the standard SIS model.

2023-09-20, **The Pantheon+ supernovae are consistent with a large-scale isotropic universe**, Li Tang et.al., [2309.11320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11320v1)

 We investigate the possible anisotropy of the universe using the most up-to-date type Ia supernovae, i.e. the Pantheon+ compilation. We fit the full Pantheon+ data with the dipole-modulated $\Lambda$CDM model, and find that it is well consistent with a null dipole. We further divide the full sample into several subsamples with different high-redshift cutoff   $z\_c$. It is shown that the dipole appears at $2\sigma$ confidence level only if $z\_c\leq 0.1$, and in this redshift region the dipole is very stable, almost independent of the specific value of $z\_c$. For $z\_c=0.1$, the dipole amplitude is $D=1.0\_{-0.4}^{+0.4}\times 10^{-3}$, pointing towards $(l,b)=(334.5\_{\ -21.6^{\circ}}^{\circ +25.7^{\circ}},16.0\_{\ -16.8^{\circ}}^{\circ +27.1^{\circ}})$, which is about $65^{\circ}$ away from the CMB dipole. This implies that the full Pantheon+ is consistent with a large-scale isotropic universe, but the low-redshift anisotropy couldn't be purely explained by the peculiar motion of the local universe.

2023-09-20, **Transient events in the near-nuclear regions of AGNs and quasars as the sources of the proper motion imitations**, I. M. Khamitov et.al., [2309.11308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11308v1)

 We present a sample of SRG/eROSITA X-ray sources located in the eastern Galactic hemisphere (0<l<180 deg), with significant proper motions according to GAIA eDR3 measurements and whose extragalactic nature has been confirmed. The catalog consists of 248 extragalactic sources with spectroscopically measured redshifts. It includes all objects available in the Simbad database and matched to the identified optical component within a radius of 0.5 arcsec. Additionally, the catalog includes 18 sources with the spectral redshift measurements based on observations at the Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope RTT-150. The sources of the catalog are AGNs of various types (Sy1, Sy2, LINER), quasars, radio galaxies, and star-forming galaxies. The imitation of significant proper motions can be explained (previously known in astrometry as the VIM effect) by the presence of transient events on the line of sight in the field of view of AGN nuclei and quasars (within the GAIA resolution element). Such astrophysical phenomena may be the supernovae outbursts, tidal destruction events in AGNs with double nuclei, variability of large-mass supergiants, the presence of O-B associations in field of view of variable brightness AGN, etc. A model of flares with a fast rise and exponential decay profile allows to describe the variable positional parameters of most similar sources observed in GAIA. This cross-matching approach of the X-ray source catalogs of the SRG/eROSITA observatory and the optical catalog of the GAIA observatory can be used as an independent technique for detecting transient events in the neighborhood of AGN core (on scales of several hundred parsecs in the picture plane).

2023-09-20, **Exploration of Nuclear Matter Properties and Related Thermodynamical Aspects**, Vishal Parmar et.al., [2309.11162v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11162v1)

 In this study, my main goal is to examine the nuclear matter properties across a wide range of conditions, such as temperature, density, asymmetry, pressure, and magnetic field. Understanding the effect of these factors on nuclear matter is essential, given their relevance in various phenomena such as heavy-ion collisions, neutron stars, and supernovae. However, due to the absence of a fundamental nuclear theory, we must rely on models to describe the nuclear matter. Predicted properties like neutron star mass-radius relationships, tidal deformability, structure, critical points in the nuclear matter phase diagram etc. depend on the chosen model. This dependence arises because key parameters characterizing any nuclear model or equation of state (EoS) are not precisely known. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate how nuclear matter properties behave under various conditions and in relation to different EoS parameters. To accomplish this, I have examined three distinct forms of nuclear matter: infinite nuclear matter, finite nuclei, and neutron stars, using the effective relativistic mean field model (E-RMF).
