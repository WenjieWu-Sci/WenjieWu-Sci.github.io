2023-10-31, **Phenomenology of Lepton Masses and Mixing with Discrete Flavor Symmetries**, Garv Chauhan et.al., [2310.20681v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20681v1)

 The observed pattern of fermion masses and mixing is an outstanding puzzle in particle physics, generally known as the flavor problem. Over the years, guided by precision neutrino oscillation data, discrete flavor symmetries have often been used to explain the neutrino mixing parameters, which look very different from the quark sector. In this review, we discuss the application of non-Abelian finite groups to the theory of neutrino masses and mixing in the light of current and future neutrino oscillation data. We start with an overview of the neutrino mixing parameters, comparing different global fit results and limits on normal and inverted neutrino mass ordering schemes. Then, we discuss a general framework for implementing discrete family symmetries to explain neutrino masses and mixing. We discuss CP violation effects, giving an update of CP predictions for trimaximal models with nonzero reactor mixing angle and models with partial $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry, and constraining models with neutrino mass sum rules. The connection between texture zeroes and discrete symmetries is also discussed. We summarize viable higher-order groups, which can explain the observed pattern of lepton mixing where the non-zero $\theta\_{13}$ plays an important role. We also review the prospects of embedding finite discrete symmetries in the Grand Unified Theories and with extended Higgs fields. Models based on modular symmetry are also briefly discussed. A major part of the review is dedicated to the phenomenology of flavor symmetries and possible signatures in the current and future experiments at the intensity, energy, and cosmic frontiers. In this context, we discuss flavor symmetry implications for neutrinoless double beta decay, collider signals, leptogenesis, dark matter, as well as gravitational waves.

2023-10-31, **On the possible jet contribution to the $γ$-ray luminosity in NGC 1068**, S. Salvatore et.al., [2310.20629v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20629v1)

 NGC 1068 is a nearby widely studied Seyfert II galaxy presenting radio, infrared, X- and $\gamma$-ray emission as well as strong evidence for high-energy neutrino emission. Recently, the evidence for neutrino emission could be explained in a multimessenger model in which the neutrinos originate from the corona of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). In this environment $\gamma$-rays are strongly absorbed, so that an additional contribution from e.g. the circumnuclear starburst ring is necessary. In this work, we discuss whether the radio jet can be an alternative source of the $\gamma$-rays between about $0.1$ and $100$ GeV as observed by Fermi-LAT. In particular, we include both leptonic and hadronic processes, i.e. accounting for inverse Compton emission and signatures from $pp$ as well as $p\gamma$ interactions. In order to constrain our calculations, we use VLBA and ALMA observations of the radio knot structures, which are spatially resolved at different distances from the supermassive black hole. Our results show that the best leptonic scenario for the prediction of the Fermi-LAT data is provided by the radio knot closest to the central engine. For that a magnetic field strength $\sim 1\,\text{mG}$ is needed as well as a strong spectral softening of the relativistic electron distribution at $(1-10)\,\text{GeV}$. However, we show that neither such a weak magnetic field strength nor such a strong softening is expected for that knot. A possible explanation for the $\sim$ 10 GeV $\gamma$-rays can be provided by hadronic pion production in case of a gas density $\gtrsim 10^4\,\text{cm}^{-3}$. Nonetheless, this process cannot contribute significantly to the low energy end of the Fermi-LAT range. We conclude that the emission sites in the jet are not able to explain the $\gamma$-rays in the whole Fermi-LAT energy band.

2023-10-31, **A New Kilohertz Gravitational-Wave Feature from Rapidly Rotating Core-Collapse Supernovae**, He-Feng Hsieh et.al., [2310.20411v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20411v1)

 We present self-consistent three-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations of a rotating $20M\_\odot$ progenitor model with various initial angular velocities from $0.0$ to $4.0$ rad s$^{-1}$ using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, SPHYNX, and a grid-based hydrodynamics code, FLASH. We identify two strong gravitational-wave features, with peak frequencies of $\sim300$ Hz and $\sim1.3$ kHz in the first $100$ ms postbounce. We demonstrate that these two features are associated with the $m=1$ deformation from the proto-neutron star (PNS) modulation induced by the low-$T/\|W\|$ instability, regardless of the simulation code. The $300$ Hz feature is present in models with an initial angular velocity between $1.0$ and $4.0$ rad s$^{-1}$, while the $1.3$ kHz feature is present only in a narrower range, from $1.5$ to $3.5$ rad s$^{-1}$. We show that the $1.3$ kHz signal originates from the high-density inner core of the PNS, and the $m=1$ deformation triggers a strong asymmetric distribution of electron anti-neutrinos. In addition to the $300$ Hz and $1.3$ kHz features, we also observe one weaker but noticeable gravitational-wave feature from higher-order modes in the range between $1.5$ and $3.5$ rad s$^{-1}$. Its peak frequency is around $800$ Hz initially and gradually increases to $900-1000$ Hz. Therefore, in addition to the gravitational bounce signal, the detection of the $300$ Hz, $1.3$ kHz, the higher-order mode, and even the related asymmetric emission of neutrinos, could provide additional diagnostics to estimate the initial angular velocity of a collapsing core.

2023-10-31, **Large extra dimensions from higher-dimensional inflation**, Luis A. Anchordoqui et.al., [2310.20282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20282v1)

 We propose the possibility that compact extra dimensions can obtain large size by higher dimensional inflation, relating the weakness of the actual gravitational force to the size of the observable universe. Solution to the horizon problem implies that the fundamental scale of gravity is smaller than $10^{13}$ GeV which can be realised in a braneworld framework for any number of extra dimensions. However, requirement of (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations makes this simple proposal possible only for one extra dimension at around the micron scale. After the end of five-dimensional inflation, the radion modulus can be stabilised at a vacuum with positive energy of the order of the present dark energy scale. An attractive possibility is based on the contribution to the Casimir energy of right-handed neutrinos with a mass at a similar scale.

2023-10-30, **Constraints on Hidden Sectors Using Rare Kaon Decays**, D. Cogollo et.al., [2310.19959v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19959v1)

 The charged Kaon meson ($K^+$) features several hadronic decay modes, but the most relevant contribution to its decay width stems from the leptonic decay $K^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu\_\mu $. Given the precision acquired on the rare decay mode $K^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu\_\mu + X$, one can use the data to set constraints on sub-GeV hidden sectors featuring light species that could contribute to it. Light gauge bosons that couple to muons could give rise to sizeable contributions. In this work, we will use data from the $K^+ \rightarrow \mu^+\nu\_{\mu} l^+l^-$, and $K^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu\_{\mu} \nu \bar{\nu}$ decays to place limits on light vector bosons present in Two Higgs Doublet Models (2HDM) augmented by an Abelian gauge symmetry, 2HDM-$U(1)\_X$. We put our findings into perpective with collider bounds, atomic parity violation, neutrino-electron scattering, and polarized electron scattering probes to show that rare Kaon decays provide competitive bounds in the sub-GeV mass range for different values of $\tan\beta$.

2023-10-30, **Exploring Neutrino Mass Orderings through Supernova Neutrino Detection**, Maria Manuela Saez et.al., [2310.19939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19939v1)

 Core-collapse supernovae (SNs) are one of the most powerful cosmic sources of neutrinos, with energies of several MeV. The emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors carries away the gravitational binding energy of the compact remnant and drives its evolution from the hot initial to the cold final states. Detecting these neutrinos from Earth and analyzing the emitted signals present a unique opportunity to explore the neutrino mass ordering problem. This research outlines the detection of neutrinos from SNs and their relevance in understanding the neutrino mass ordering. The focus is on developing a model-independent analysis strategy, achieved by comparing distinct detection channels in large underground detectors. The objective is to identify potential indicators of mass ordering within the neutrino sector. Additionally, a thorough statistical analysis is performed on the anticipated neutrino signals for both mass orderings. Despite uncertainties in supernova explosion parameters, an exploration of the parameter space reveals an extensive array of models with significant sensitivity to differentiate between mass orderings. The assessment of various observables and their combinations underscores the potential of forthcoming supernova observations in addressing the neutrino mass ordering problem.

2023-10-30, **Detectable MeV Neutrino Signals from Neutron-Star Common-Envelope Systems**, Ivan Esteban et.al., [2310.19868v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19868v1)

 Common-envelope evolution - where a star is engulfed by a companion - is a critical but poorly understood step in, e.g., the formation pathways for gravitational-wave sources. However, it has been extremely challenging to identify observable signatures of such systems. We show that for systems involving a neutron star, the hypothesized super-Eddington accretion onto the neutron star produces MeV-range, months-long neutrino signals within reach of present and planned detectors. While there are substantial uncertainties on the rate of such events (0.01-1/century in the Milky Way) and the neutrino luminosity (which may be less than the accretion power), this signal can only be found if dedicated new searches are developed. If detected, the neutrino signal would lead to significant new insights into the astrophysics of common-envelope evolution.

2023-10-30, **Deep-learning-based decomposition of overlapping-sparse images: application at the vertex of neutrino interactions**, Saúl Alonso-Monsalve et.al., [2310.19695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19695v1)

 Image decomposition plays a crucial role in various computer vision tasks, enabling the analysis and manipulation of visual content at a fundamental level. Overlapping images, which occur when multiple objects or scenes partially occlude each other, pose unique challenges for decomposition algorithms. The task intensifies when working with sparse images, where the scarcity of meaningful information complicates the precise extraction of components. This paper presents a solution that leverages the power of deep learning to accurately extract individual objects within multi-dimensional overlapping-sparse images, with a direct application in high-energy physics with decomposition of overlaid elementary particles obtained from imaging detectors. In particular, the proposed approach tackles a highly complex yet unsolved problem: identifying and measuring independent particles at the vertex of neutrino interactions, where one expects to observe detector images with multiple indiscernible overlapping charged particles. By decomposing the image of the detector activity at the vertex through deep learning, it is possible to infer the kinematic parameters of the identified low-momentum particles - which otherwise would remain neglected - and enhance the reconstructed energy resolution of the neutrino event. We also present an additional step - that can be tuned directly on detector data - combining the above method with a fully-differentiable generative model to improve the image decomposition further and, consequently, the resolution of the measured parameters, achieving unprecedented results. This improvement is crucial for precisely measuring the parameters that govern neutrino flavour oscillations and searching for asymmetries between matter and antimatter.

2023-10-30, **Casimir Energy Stabilization of Standard Model Landscape in Dark Dimension**, Chuanxin Cui et.al., [2310.19592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19592v1)

 In this paper we present a realization of dark dimension. We consider the 5D standard model coupling to gravity with one dimension compactified on an orbifold, which is seen as dark dimension of size R. We stabilize the radion by casimir effect wrapping around compact dimension and recover the neutrino mass and 4D cosmological constant with the observed value. Orbifold can lead to a natural resolution of chirality problem in 5D at low energy, which we briefly discussed in the paper. Although we found that the radion mass is too light to survive under solar system tests of GR, several screening mechanisms might give us a solution, for example, Chameleon mechanism.

2023-10-30, **A Cosmic Window on the Dark Axion Portal**, Heejoung Hong et.al., [2310.19544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19544v1)

 Axions and dark photons are common in many extensions of the Standard Model. The dark axion portal -- an axion coupling to the dark photon and photon -- can significantly modify their phenomenology. We study the cosmological constraints on the dark axion portal from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) bounds on the energy density of dark radiation, $\Delta N\_\text{eff}$. By computing the axion-photon-dark photon collision terms and solving the Boltzmann equations including their effects, we find that light axions are generally more constrained by $\Delta N\_\text{eff}$ than from supernova cooling or collider experiments. However, with dark photons at the MeV scale, a window of parameter space is opened up above the supernova limits and below the experimental exclusion, allowing for axion decay constants as low as $f\_a \sim 10^4$ GeV. This region also modifies indirectly the neutrino energy density, thus relaxing the cosmological upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses. Future CMB measurements could detect a signal or close this open window on the dark axion portal.

2023-10-30, **First-forbidden transition of nuclear $β$ decay by projected shell model**, Bin-Lei Wang et.al., [2310.19523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19523v1)

 The first-forbidden transition of nuclear $\beta$ decay is expected to play crucial roles in many aspects in nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics and particle physics such as the stellar $\beta$-decay rates and the reactor anti-neutrino spectra. In this work we develop the projected shell model (PSM) for description of first-forbidden transition of nuclear $\beta$ decay for the first time. Detailed theoretical framework and logics are provided, and 35 dominant first-forbidden transitions that are expected to be important for the reactor anti-neutrino spectra problems are calculated and compared systematically with the data to test the new development of the PSM. The corresponding experimental Log$f\_0 t$ values are described reasonably, and the quenching factors of nuclear matrix elements are found to affect the Log$f\_0 t$ values as well as the related shape factors, which may be helpful for better understanding of the reactor anti-neutrino spectra problems.

2023-10-30, **The unprecedented flaring activities around Mrk 421 in 2012 and 2013: The test for neutrino and UHECR event connection**, Nissim Fraija et.al., [2310.19227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19227v1)

 Since its mission, Fermi Collaboration reported the highest flux observed during July - September 2012 for the BL Lac Markarian 421 (Mrk 421). The integrated flux was eight times greater than the average flux reported in the second Fermi catalog. During April 2013, Mrk 421 exhibited the highest TeV $\gamma$-ray and optical fluxes recorded. The Telescope Array (TA) collaboration reported the arrival of 72 ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), two in temporal and positional coincidence with the flaring activity observed in 2012 and one with the flaring activity in 2013. The IceCube collaboration has reported around 100 neutrino events in the High-Energy Starting Events (HESE) catalog. Although no neutrino track-like event has been associated with this source, a neutrino shower-like event (IC31) is in temporal and positional coincidence with the flare in 2012. Describing the broadband spectral energy distribution during the flaring activities exhibited in 2012 and 2013 with one- and two-zone lepto-hadronic scenarios and one-zone SSC model, we study a possible correlation between the neutrino event IC31 and the three UHECRs. We estimate the number of neutrino and UHECR events generated from the proposed models, and show that while the neutrino events are low to associate the event IC31 with Mrk 421, the number of UHECRs are similar to those reported by TA collaboration.

2023-10-31, **Evaluating the reconstruction of individual haloes in constrained cosmological simulations**, Richard Stiskalek et.al., [2310.20672v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20672v1)

 Constrained cosmological simulations play an important role in modelling the local Universe, enabling investigation of the dark matter content of local structures and their formation histories. We introduce a method for determining the extent to which individual haloes are reliably reconstructed between constrained simulations, and apply it to the Constrained Simulations in BORG (CSiBORG) suite of $101$ high-resolution realisations across the posterior probability distribution of initial conditions from the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm. The method is based on the overlap of the initial Lagrangian patch of a halo in one simulation with those in another, and therefore measures the degree to which the haloes' particles are initially coincident. By this metric we find consistent reconstructions of $M\gtrsim10^{14}~M\_\odot / h$ haloes across the CSiBORG simulations, indicating that the constraints from the BORG algorithm are sufficient to pin down the masses, positions and peculiar velocities of clusters to high precision. The effect of the constraints tapers off towards lower mass however, and the halo spins and concentrations are largely unconstrained at all masses. We document the advantages of evaluating halo consistency in the initial conditions, describe how the method may be used to quantify our knowledge of the halo field given galaxy survey data analysed through the lens of probabilistic inference machines such as BORG, and describe applications to matched but unconstrained simulations.

2023-10-31, **Reconstructing long-lived particles with the ILD detector**, Jan Klamka et.al., [2310.20534v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20534v1)

 Future e$^+$e$^-$ colliders, thanks to their clean environment and triggerless operation, offer a unique opportunity to search for long-lived particles (LLPs). Considered in this contribution are promising prospects for LLP searches offered by the International Large Detector (ILD), with a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) as the core of its tracking systems, providing almost continuous tracking. The ILD has been developed as a detector concept for the ILC, however, studies on understanding of the ILD performance at other collider concepts are ongoing. Based on the full detector simulation, we study the possibility of reconstructing decays of both light and heavy LLPs at the ILD. For the heavy, $\mathcal{O}$(100 GeV) LLPs, we consider a challenging scenario with small mass splitting between the LLP and the dark matter candidate, resulting in only a very soft displaced track pair in the final state, not pointing to the interaction point. We account for the soft beam-induced background (from measurable e$^+$e$^-$ pairs and hadron photo-production processes), expected to give the dominant background contribution due to a very high cross section, and show the possible means of its reduction. As the opposite extreme scenario we consider the production of a light, $\mathcal{O}$(1 GeV) pseudo-scalar LLP, which decays to two highly boosted and almost colinear displaced tracks. We also present the corresponding results for an alternative ILD design, where the TPC is replaced by a silicon tracker modified from the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) design.

2023-10-31, **Kinetic recoupling of dark matter**, Benjamin V. Lehmann et.al., [2310.20513v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20513v1)

 We study the possibility that dark matter re-enters kinetic equilibrium with a radiation bath after kinetic decoupling, a scenario we dub kinetic recoupling. This naturally occurs, for instance, with certain types of resonantly-enhanced interactions, or as the result of a phase transition. While late kinetic decoupling damps structure on small scales below a cutoff, kinetic recoupling produces more complex changes in the power spectrum that depend on the nature and extent of the recoupling period. We explore the features that kinetic recoupling imprints upon the matter power spectrum, and discuss how such features can be traced to dark matter microphysics with future observations.

2023-10-31, **Direct detection of dark matter: a critical review**, Marcin Misiaszek et.al., [2310.20472v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20472v1)

 The nature of the dark matter in the Universe is one of the hardest unsolved problems in modern physics. Indeed, on one hand, the overwhelming indirect evidence from astrophysics seems to leave no doubt about its existence; on the other hand, direct search experiments, especially those conducted with low background detectors in underground laboratories all over the world seem to deliver only null results, with a few debated exceptions. Furthermore, the lack of predicted candidates at the LHC energy scale has made this dichotomy even more puzzling. We will recall the most important phases of this novel branch of experimental astro-particle physics, analyzing the interconnections among the main projects involved in this challenging quest, and we will draw conclusions slightly different from how the problem is commonly understood.

2023-10-31, **A forecast of the sensitivity of the DALI Experiment to Galactic axion dark matter**, Juan F. Hernández Cabrera et.al., [2310.20437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20437v1)

 The axion is a long-postulated boson that can simultaneously solve two fundamental problems of modern physics: the charge-parity symmetry problem in the strong interaction and the enigma of dark matter. In this work we estimate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the sensitivity of the Dark-photons$\&$Axion-Like particles Interferometer (DALI), a new-generation Fabry-P\'erot haloscope proposed to probe axion dark matter in the 25-250 $\mu$eV band.

2023-10-31, **Exponential F(R) gravity with axion dark matter**, Sergei D. Odintsov et.al., [2310.20302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20302v1)

 The cosmological evolution within the framework of exponential $F(R)$ gravity is analysed by assuming two forms for dark matter: (a) a standard dust-like fluid and (b) an axion scalar field. As shown in previous literature, an axion-like field oscillates during the cosmological evolution but can play the role of dark matter when approaching the minimum of its potential. Both scenarios are confronted with recent observational data including the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter estimations (Cosmic Chronometers), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Cosmic Microwave Background distances. The models show great possibilities in describing these observations when compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the viability of exponential $F(R)$ gravity. The differences between both descriptions of dark matter is analysed.

2023-10-31, **How do baryonic effects on the cosmic matter distribution vary with scale and local density environment?**, Yun Wang et.al., [2310.20278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20278v1)

 In this study, we investigate how the baryonic effects vary with scale and local density environment mainly by utilizing a novel statistic, the environment-dependent wavelet power spectrum (env-WPS). With four state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suites, EAGLE, SIMBA, Illustris, and IllustrisTNG, we compare the env-WPS of the total matter density field between the hydrodynamic and dark matter-only (DMO) runs at $z=0$. We find that the clustering is most strongly suppressed in the emptiest environment of $\rho\_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho\_\mathrm{m}<0.1$ with maximum amplitudes $\sim67-89$ per cent on scales $\sim1.86-10.96\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and less suppressed in higher density environments on small scales (except Illustris). In the environments of $\rho\_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho\_\mathrm{m}\geqslant0.316$ ($\geqslant10$ in EAGLE), the feedbacks also lead to enhancement features at intermediate and large scales, which is most pronounced in the densest environment of $\rho\_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho\_\mathrm{m}\geqslant100$ and reaches a maximum $\sim 7-15$ per cent on scales $\sim0.87-2.62\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ (except Illustris). The baryon fraction of the local environment decreases with increasing density, denoting the feedback strength, and potentially explaining some differences between simulations. We also measure the volume and mass fractions of local environments, which are affected by $\gtrsim 1$ per cent due to baryon physics. In conclusion, our results reveal that the baryonic processes can change the overall cosmic structure greatly over the scales of $k>0.1\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. These findings warrant further investigation and confirmation by using much larger or more numerous simulations, comparing different cosmic structure classifications, or altering a specific process in the simulation, e.g. the star formation, black hole accretion, stellar feedback or active galactic nucleus feedback.

2023-10-31, **Beyond Best-Fits and Model Selection -- Introducing "Reliability" of cusp-core inference of dark matter halos**, Manush Manju et.al., [2310.20272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20272v1)

 We introduce the notion of a Bayesian analysis motivated `reliability' that gives a truer distinction of cusp-core and other halo-parameters (like mass-concentration) in an ensemble of observed galaxies. Our approach goes beyond the standard statistical techniques of parameter estimation and model fitting. We create hundreds of thousands of realistic mock SPARC RCs, with both cuspy and cored DM density profiles as model inputs. These RCs carefully incorporate the details of SPARC data such as the nature of observed uncertainties and different sources of scatters arising from observation, presence of baryons, DM mass-concentration, etc. Bayesian analysis of these mock RCs enables us to reconstruct and identify the parameter space in galaxy observable and theory where one can venture beyond best-fits to a preferred DM halo model or model selections between different density models. We find that it is imperative to choose low stellar surface density ($\Sigma\_{\star}$) galaxies for reliable cusp-vs-core distinction; for example, RC data for galaxies with $\Sigma\_{\star} \leq 2.5$ is needed for a 75\% confidence in distinguishing cusps from cores. Similarly, we also find that for correct estimations of the halo masses and concentrations, the RCs need to be measured to at least a radial distance $\geq 0.8r\_s$ where $r\_s$ is the scale radii of the corresponding DM halo density profiles. Out of the total $\sim$ 135 SPARC galaxies, using our reliability criteria, we find that only 21 RCs clear the bar to be used for any unbiased cusp-core distinction as well as DM halo mass-concentration estimates at $\geq$75\% reliability confidence level. With $\geq$66\% ( $\geq$50\%) reliability settings, the sample size increases to 44 (59). Interestingly, in the $\geq 75$\% reliable subsample, there are 5 times more galaxies that are reliably cored than cuspy. [Abridged]

2023-10-31, **Search for the Sagittarius tidal stream of axion dark matter around 4.55 $μ$eV**, B. R. Ko et.al., [2310.20116v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20116v1)

 We report the first search for the Sagittarius tidal stream of axion dark matter around 4.55 $\mu$eV using CAPP-12TB haloscope data acquired in March of 2022. Our result excluded the Sagittarius tidal stream of Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitskii and Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov axion dark matter densities of $\rho\_a\gtrsim0.184$ and $\gtrsim0.025$ GeV/cm$^3$, respectively, over a mass range from 4.51 to 4.59 $\mu$eV at a 90\% confidence level.

2023-10-30, **Dark Matter Annihilation and Pair-Instability Supernovae**, Djuna Croon et.al., [2310.20044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20044v1)

 We study the evolution of heavy stars ($M\ge40{\rm M}\_\odot$) undergoing pair-instability in the presence of annihilating dark matter. Focusing on the scenario where the dark matter is in capture-annihilation equilibrium, we model the profile of energy injections in the local thermal equilibrium approximation. We find that significant changes to masses of astrophysical black holes formed by (pulsational) pair-instability supernovae can occur when the ambient dark matter density $ \rho\_{\rm DM} \gtrsim10^9 \rm \, GeV \, cm^{-3}$. There are two distinct outcomes, depending on the dark matter mass. For masses $m\_{\rm DM}\gtrsim1$ GeV the DM is primarily confined to the core. The annihilation increases the lifetime of core helium burning, resulting in more oxygen being formed, fueling a more violent explosion during the pair-instability-induced contraction. This drives stronger pulsations, leading to lighter black holes being formed than predicted by the standard model. For masses $m\_{\rm DM}\lesssim0.5$ GeV there is significant dark matter in the envelope, leading to a phase where the star is supported by the energy from the annihilation. This reduces the core temperature and density, allowing the star to evade the pair-instability allowing heavier black holes to be formed. We find a mass gap for all models studied.

2023-10-30, **Cosmological simulations of mixed ultralight dark matter**, Alex Laguë et.al., [2310.20000v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20000v1)

 The era of precision cosmology allows us to test the composition of the dark matter. Mixed ultralight or fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is a cosmological model with dark matter composed of a combination of particles of mass $m\leq 10^{-20}$ eV, with an astrophysical de Broglie wavelength, and particles with a negligible wavelength sharing the properties of cold dark matter (CDM). In this work, we simulate cosmological volumes with a dark matter wave function for the ultralight component coupled gravitationally to CDM particles. We investigate the impact of a mixture of CDM and FDM in various proportions $(0\%,\;1\%,\;10\%,\;50\%,\;100\%)$ and for ultralight particle masses ranging over five orders of magnitude $(2.5\times 10^{-25}\;\mathrm{eV}-2.5\times 10^{-21}\;\mathrm{eV})$. To track the evolution of density perturbations in the non-linear regime, we adapt the simulation code AxioNyx to solve the CDM dynamics coupled to a FDM wave function obeying the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations. We obtain the non-linear power spectrum and study the impact of the wave effects on the growth of structure on different scales. We confirm that the steady-state solution of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system holds at the center of halos in the presence of a CDM component when it composes $50\%$ or less of the dark matter but find no stable density core when the FDM accounts for $10\%$ or less of the dark matter. We implement a modified friends-of-friends halo finder and find good agreement between the observed halo abundance and the predictions from the adapted halo model axionHMCode.

2023-10-30, **Constraining primordial black hole masses through $f(R)$ gravity scalarons in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis**, Abhijit Talukdar et.al., [2310.19968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19968v1)

 Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is a strong probe for constraining new physics including gravitation. $f(R)$ gravity theory is an interesting alternative to general relativity which introduces additional degrees of freedom known as scalarons. In this work we demonstrate the existence of black hole solutions in $f(R)$ gravity and develop a relation between scalaron mass and black hole mass. We have used observed bound on the freezeout temperature to constrain scalaron mass range by modifying the cosmic expansion rate at the BBN epoch. The mass range of primordial black holes (PBHs) which are astrophysical dark matter candidates is deduced. The range of scalaron mass which does not spoil the BBN era is found to be $10^{-16}-10^4 \text{ eV}$. The scalaron mass window $10^{-16}-10^{-14}\text{ eV}$ is consistent with the $f(R)$ gravity PPN parameter derived from solar system experiments. The PBH mass range is obtained as $10^6-10^{-14}\text{ }M\_{\odot}$. Scalarons constrained by BBN are also eligible to accommodate axion like dark matter particles. Estimation of deuterium (D) fraction and relative D+$^3$He abundance in the $f(R)$ gravity scenario shows that the BBN history mimics that of general relativity. While the PBH mass range is eligible for non-baryonic dark matter, the BBN bounded scalarons provide with an independent strong field test of $f(R)$ gravity.

 Many different approaches have been made to explain the nature of dark matter (DM), but it remains and unsolved mystery of our universe. In this work we examine a type II two-Higgs-doublet model extended by a complex singlet (2HDMS), where the pseudo-scalar component of the singlet acts as a natural DM candidate. The DM candidate is stabilized by a Z'2 symmetry, which is broken spontaneously by the singlet acquiring a vacuum expectation value (vev). This vev in turn causes the scalar component of the singlet to mix with the scalar components of the two doublets, which results in three scalar Higgs particles. Additionally we aim to include an excess around 95 GeV, which was observed at CSM and LEP and can be explained by one of the three scalar Higgs particles. After introducing the model, we apply experimental and theoretical constraints and find a viable benchmark point. We then look into the DM phenomenology as well as collider phenomenology.

 Screening mechanisms allow light scalar fields to dynamically avoid the constraints that come from our lack of observation of a long-range fifth force. Galactic scale tests are of particular interest when the light scalar is introduced to explain the dark matter or dark energy that dominates our cosmology. To date, much of the literature that has studied screening in galaxies has described screening using simplifying approximations. In this work, we calculate numerical solutions for scalar fields with screening mechanisms in galactic contexts, and use these to derive new, precise conditions governing where fifth forces are screened. We show that the commonly used binary screened/unscreened threshold can predict a fifth force signal in situations where a fuller treatment does not, leading us to conclude that existing constraints might be significantly overestimated. We show that various other approximations of the screening radius provide a more accurate proxy to screening, although they fail to exactly reproduce the true screening surface in certain regions of parameter space. As a demonstration of our scheme, we apply it to an idealised Milky Way and thus identify the region of parameter space in which the solar system is screened.

 The near infrared background (NIRB) is the collective light from unresolved sources observed in the band 1-10 $\mu$m. The measured NIRB angular power spectrum on angular scales $\theta \gtrsim 1$ arcmin exceeds by roughly two order of magnitudes predictions from known galaxy populations. The nature of the sources producing these fluctuations is still unknown. Here we test primordial black holes (PBHs) as sources of the NIRB excess. Considering PBHs as a cold dark matter (DM) component, we model the emission of gas accreting onto PBHs in a cosmological framework. We account for both accretion in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and in DM haloes. We self consistently derive the IGM temperature evolution, considering ionization and heating due to X-ray emission from PBHs. Besides $\Lambda$CDM, we consider a model that accounts for the modification of the linear matter power spectrum due to the presence of PBHs; we also explore two PBH mass distributions, i.e. a $\delta$-function and a lognormal distribution. For each model, we compute the mean intensity and the angular power spectrum of the NIRB produced by PBHs with mass 1-$10^3~\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$. In the limiting case in which the entirety of DM is made of PBHs, the PBH emission contributes $<1$ per cent to the observed NIRB fluctuations. This value decreases to $<0.1$ per cent if current constraints on the abundance of PBHs are taken into account. We conclude that PBHs are ruled out as substantial contributors to the NIRB.

 The standard paradigm for the formation of the Universe suggests that large structures are formed from hierarchical clustering by the continuous accretion of less massive galaxy systems through filaments. In this context, filamentary structures play an important role in the properties and evolution of galaxies by connecting high-density regions, such as nodes, and being surrounded by low-density regions, such as cosmic voids. The availability of the filament and point critic catalogues extracted by \textsc{DisPerSE} from the \textsc{Illustris} TNG300-1 hydrodynamic simulation allows a detailed analysis of these structures. The halo occupation distribution (HOD) is a powerful tool for linking galaxies and dark matter halos, allowing constrained models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this work we combine the advantage of halo occupancy with information from the filament network to analyse the HOD in filaments and nodes. In our study, we distinguish the inner regions of cosmic filaments and nodes from their surroundings. The results show that the filamentary structures have a similar trend to the total galaxy sample indicating that, although the filaments span a wide range of densities, they may represent regions of average density. In the case of the nodes sample, an excess of faint and blue galaxies is found for the low-mass nodes suggesting that these structures are not virialised and that galaxies may be continuously falling through the filaments. Instead, the higher-mass halos could be in a more advanced stage of evolution showing features of virialised structures.

2023-10-30, **MONDified Gravity**, Martin Bojowald et.al., [2310.19894v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19894v1)

 A new class of modified gravity theories, made possible by subtle features of the canonical formulation of general covariance, naturally allows MOND-like behavior (MOdified Newtonian Dynamics) in effective space-time solutions without introducing new fields. A detailed analysis reveals a relationship with various quantum-gravity features, in particular in canonical approaches, and shows several properties of potential observational relevance. A fundamental origin of MOND and a corresponding solution to the dark-matter problem are therefore possible and testable.

 In the recent years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as one of the most interesting and hotly debated topics in cosmology. Among other possibilities, PBHs could explain both some of the signals from binary black hole mergers observed in gravitational wave detectors and an important component of the dark matter in the Universe. Significant progress has been achieved both on the theory side and from the point of view of observations, including new models and more accurate calculations of PBH formation, evolution, clustering, merger rates, as well as new astrophysical and cosmological probes. In this work, we review, analyse and combine the latest developments in order to perform end-to-end calculations of the various gravitational wave signatures of PBHs. Different ways to distinguish PBHs from stellar black holes are emphasized. Finally, we discuss their detectability with LISA, the first planned gravitational-wave observatory in space.

2023-10-30, **Core and Halo Properties in Multi-Field Wave Dark Matter**, Fabio van Dissel et.al., [2310.19762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19762v1)

 In this work, we compute multi-field core and halo properties in wave Dark Matter models. We focus on the case where Dark Matter consists of two light (real) scalars, interacting gravitationally. As in the single-field Ultra Light Dark Matter (ULDM) case, the scalar field behaves as a coherent BEC with a definite ground state (at fixed total mass), often referred to in the literature as a gravitational soliton. We establish an efficient algorithm to find the ground and excited states of such two-field systems. We then use simulations to investigate the gravitational collapse and virialization, starting from different initial conditions, into solitons and surrounding halo. As in the single-field case, a virialized halo forms with a gravitational soliton (ground state) at the center. We find some evidence for an empirical relation between the soliton mass and energy and those of the host halo. We use this to then find a numerical relation between the properties of the two. Finally, we use this to address the issue of alleviating some of the tensions that single-field ULDM has with observational data, in particular, the issue of how a galaxy's core and radius are related. We find that if galaxies of different masses have similar percentages of the two species, then the core-radius scaling tension is not addressed. However, if the lighter species is more abundant in lighter galaxies, then the tension can be alleviated.

 It is well-known that Dark Matter (DM) inside a satellite galaxy orbiting a host halo experiences a tidal potential. For Ultra-Light Dark Matter (ULDM), due to its wave-like nature, one expects it to tunnel out of the satellite - if this happens sufficiently quickly, then the satellite will not survive over cosmological timescales, severely constraining the dark matter model. In this paper, we study the effects of the inevitable quartic self-interaction of scalar ULDM on the lifetimes of satellite galaxies by looking for quasi-stationary solutions with outgoing wave boundary conditions. For a satellite with some known core mass and orbital period, we find that, attractive (repulsive) self-interactions decrease (increase) the rate of tunnelling of DM out of it. In particular, for satellite galaxies with core mass $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^7-10^8)\ M\_\odot$ and orbital period $\sim \mathcal{O}(1)\ \text{Gyr}$, one can impose constraints on the strength of self-interactions as small as $\lambda\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-92})$. For instance, for ULDM mass $m = 10^{-22}\ \text{eV}$, the existence of the Fornax dwarf galaxy necessitates attractive self-interactions with $\lambda \lesssim -2.12 \times 10^{-91}$.

2023-10-31, **Supernovae Origin for the Low-Latitude-Intermediate-Velocity Arch and the North-Celestial-Pole Loop**, J. T. Schmelz et.al., [2310.20454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20454v1)

 Supernova explosions attributed to the unseen companion in several binary systems identified by the Third Gaia Data Release (Gaia DR3) may be responsible for a number of well-known and well-studied features in the radio sky, including the Low-Latitude-Intermediate-Velocity Arch and the North-Celestial-Pole Loop. Slices from the Longitude-Latitude-Velocity data cube of the $\lambda$-21-cm galactic neutral hydrogen HI4PI survey (HI4PI Collaboration et al. 2016) show multiple signatures of an expanding shell. The source of this expansion, which includes the Low-Latitude-Intermediate-Velocity Arch on the approaching side, may be the neutron star candidate in the Gaia DR3 1093757200530267520 binary. If we make the simplifying assumptions that the expansion of the cavity is uniform and spherically symmetric, then the explosion took place about 700,000 years ago. The momentum is in reasonable agreement with recent model estimates for a supernova this old. The HI on the receding side of this cavity is interacting with the gas approaching us on the near side of a second cavity. The North-Celestial-Pole Loop appears to be located at the intersection of these two expanding features. The neutron star candidate in the Gaia DR3 1144019690966028928 binary may be (in part) responsible for this cavity. Explosions from other candidates may account for the observed elongation along the line of sight of this second cavity. We can use the primary star in these binaries to anchor the distances to the Low-Latitude-Intermediate-Velocity Arch and North-Celestial-Pole Loop, which are about 167 and about 220 pc, respectively.

 $Aims:$ We used the nearby Coma Cluster as a laboratory in order to probe the impact of ram pressure on star formation as well as to constrain the characteristic timescales and velocities for the stripping of the non-thermal ISM. $Methods:$ We used high-resolution ($6.5'' \approx 3\,\mathrm{kpc}$), multi-frequency ($144\,\mathrm{MHz} - 1.5\,\mathrm{GHz}$) radio continuum imaging of the Coma Cluster to resolve the low-frequency radio spectrum across the discs and tails of 25 ram pressure stripped galaxies. With resolved spectral index maps across these galaxy discs, we constrained the impact of ram pressure perturbations on galaxy star formation. We measured multi-frequency flux-density profiles along each of the ram pressure stripped tails in our sample. We then fit the resulting radio continuum spectra with a simple synchrotron aging model. $Results:$ We showed that ram pressure stripped tails in Coma have steep ($-2 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -1$) spectral indices. The discs of galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping have integrated spectral indices within the expected range for shock acceleration from supernovae ($-0.8 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -0.5$), though there is a tail towards flatter values. In a resolved sense, there are gradients in spectral index across the discs of ram pressure stripped galaxies in Coma. These gradients are aligned with the direction of the observed radio tails, with the flattest spectral indices being found on the `leading half'. From best-fit break frequencies we estimated the projected plasma velocities along the tail to be on the order of hundreds of kilometers per second, with the precise magnitude depending on the assumed magnetic field strength.

 We present a pan-chromatic study of AT2017bcc, a nuclear transient that was discovered in 2017 within the skymap of a reported burst-like gravitational wave candidate, G274296. It was initially classified as a superluminous supernova, and then reclassified as a candidate tidal disruption event. Its optical light curve has since shown ongoing variability with a structure function consistent with that of an active galactic nucleus, however earlier data shows no variability for at least 10 years prior to the outburst in 2017. The spectrum shows complex profiles in the broad Balmer lines: a central component with a broad blue wing, and a boxy component with time-variable blue and red shoulders. The H$\alpha$ emission profile is well modelled using a circular accretion disc component, and a blue-shifted double Gaussian which may indicate a partially obscured outflow. Weak narrow lines, together with the previously flat light curve, suggest that this object represents a dormant galactic nucleus which has recently been re-activated. Our time-series modelling of the Balmer lines suggests that this is connected to a disturbance in the disc morphology, and we speculate this could involve a sudden violent event such as a tidal disruption event involving the central supermassive black hole. Although we find that the redshifts of AT2017bcc ($z=0.13$) and G274296 ($z>0.42$) are inconsistent, this event adds to the growing diversity of both nuclear transients and multi-messenger contaminants.

2023-10-31, **Square-Root parametrization of dark energy in $f(Q)$ cosmology**, M. Koussour et.al., [2310.20405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20405v1)

 This paper is a parametrization of the equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy (DE), which is parameterized using Square-Root (SR) form i.e. $\omega \_{SR}=\text{$\omega \_{0}$}+\text{$\omega \_{1}$}\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^{2}+1}}$, where $\omega \_{0}$ and $\omega \_{1}$ are free constants. This parametrization will be examined in the context of the recently suggested $f(Q)$ gravity theory as an alternative to General Relativity (GR), in which gravitational effects are attributed to the non-metricity scalar $Q$ with the functional form $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q^{n}$, where $\alpha$ and $n$ are arbitrary constants. We derived observational constraints on model parameters using the Hubble dataset with 31 data points and the Supernovae (SNe) dataset from the Pantheon samples compilation dataset with 1048 data points. For the current model, the evolution of the deceleration parameter, density parameter, EoS for DE, and $Om(z)$ diagnostic have all been investigated. It has been shown that the deceleration parameter favors the current accelerated expansion phase. It has also been shown that the EoS parameter for DE has a quintessence nature at this time.

 The cosmological evolution within the framework of exponential $F(R)$ gravity is analysed by assuming two forms for dark matter: (a) a standard dust-like fluid and (b) an axion scalar field. As shown in previous literature, an axion-like field oscillates during the cosmological evolution but can play the role of dark matter when approaching the minimum of its potential. Both scenarios are confronted with recent observational data including the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter estimations (Cosmic Chronometers), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Cosmic Microwave Background distances. The models show great possibilities in describing these observations when compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the viability of exponential $F(R)$ gravity. The differences between both descriptions of dark matter is analysed.

2023-10-30, **Dark Matter Annihilation and Pair-Instability Supernovae**, Djuna Croon et.al., [2310.20044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20044v1)

 We study the evolution of heavy stars ($M\ge40{\rm M}\_\odot$) undergoing pair-instability in the presence of annihilating dark matter. Focusing on the scenario where the dark matter is in capture-annihilation equilibrium, we model the profile of energy injections in the local thermal equilibrium approximation. We find that significant changes to masses of astrophysical black holes formed by (pulsational) pair-instability supernovae can occur when the ambient dark matter density $ \rho\_{\rm DM} \gtrsim10^9 \rm \, GeV \, cm^{-3}$. There are two distinct outcomes, depending on the dark matter mass. For masses $m\_{\rm DM}\gtrsim1$ GeV the DM is primarily confined to the core. The annihilation increases the lifetime of core helium burning, resulting in more oxygen being formed, fueling a more violent explosion during the pair-instability-induced contraction. This drives stronger pulsations, leading to lighter black holes being formed than predicted by the standard model. For masses $m\_{\rm DM}\lesssim0.5$ GeV there is significant dark matter in the envelope, leading to a phase where the star is supported by the energy from the annihilation. This reduces the core temperature and density, allowing the star to evade the pair-instability allowing heavier black holes to be formed. We find a mass gap for all models studied.

2023-10-30, **Updated Proper Motion of the Neutron Star in the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia~A**, Tyler Holland-Ashford et.al., [2310.19879v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19879v1)

 In this paper, we present updated estimates of the velocity of the neutron star (NS) in the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A using over two decades of Chandra observations. We use two methods: 1.) recording NS positions from dozens of Chandra observations, including the astrometric uncertainty estimates on the data points but not correcting the astrometry of the observations, and 2.) correcting the astrometry of the 13 Chandra observations that have a sufficient number of point sources with identified Gaia counterparts. For method #1, we find velocity of 280 $\pm$ 123 km s$^{-1}$, with an angle of 87 $\pm$ 22 degrees south of east. For method #2, we find a velocity of 445 $\pm$ 90 km s$^{-1}$ at an angle of 68 $\pm$ 12 degrees south of east. Both of these results match with the explosion-center-estimated velocity of $\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$ and the previous 10 year baseline proper motion measurement of 570 $\pm$ 260 km s$^{-1}$, but our use of additional data over a longer baseline has led to a smaller uncertainty by a factor of 2$\unicode{x2013}$3. Our estimates rule out velocities $\gtrsim$600 km s$^{-1}$ and better match with simulations of Cassiopeia A that include NS kick mechanisms.

2023-10-30, **Observational constraints on the maximum energies of accelerated particles in supernova remnants**, Hiromasa Suzuki et.al., [2310.19616v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19616v1)

 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are thought to be the most plausible sources of Galactic cosmic rays. One of the principal questions is whether they are accelerating particles up to the maximum energy of Galactic cosmic rays ($\sim$PeV). In this paper, we summarize our recent studies on gamma-ray-emitting SNRs. We first evaluated the reliability of SNR age estimates to quantitatively discuss time dependence of their acceleration parameters. Then we systematically modeled their gamma-ray spectra to constrain the acceleration parameters. The current maximum energy estimates were found to be well below PeV for most sources. The basic time dependence of the maximum energy assuming the Sedov evolution ($\approx t^{-0.8\pm0.2}$) cannot be explained with the simplest acceleration condition (Bohm limit) and requires shock-ISM (interstellar medium) interaction. The inferred maximum energies during lifetime averaged over the sample can be expressed as $\lesssim 20$ TeV ($t\_{{\rm M}}/\text{1 kyr})^{-0.8}$ with $t\_{\rm M}$ being the age at the maximum, which reaches $\sim$PeV only if $t\_{\rm M} \lesssim 10$ yr. The maximum energies during lifetime are suggested to have a variety of 1-2 orders of magnitude from object to object on the other hand. This variety will reflect the dependence on environments.

2023-10-30, **An aspherical distribution for the explosive burning ash of core-collapse supernovae**, Qiliang Fang et.al., [2310.19280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19280v1)

 It is widely believed that asphericity in the explosion is the crucial ingredient leading to successful core-collapse (CC) supernovae. However, direct observational evidence for the explosion geometry and for the connection with the progenitor properties are still missing. Based on the thus-far largest late-phase spectroscopic sample of stripped-envelope CC supernovae, we demonstrate that about half of the explosions exhibit a substantial deviation from sphericity. For these aspherical CC supernovae, the spatial distributions of the oxygen-burning ash and the unburnt oxygen, as traced by the profiles of [Ca II] {\lambda}{\lambda}7291,7323 and [O i] {\lambda}{\lambda}6300,6363 emissions, respectively, appear to be anticorrelated, which can be explained if the explosion is bipolar and the oxygen-rich material burnt into two detached iron-rich bubbles. Our combined analysis of the explosion geometry and the progenitor mass further suggests that the degree of asphericity grows with the mass of the carbon-oxygen core, which may be used to guide state-of-the-art simulations of CC supernova explosions.

 We present, for the first time, a detailed theory of high density matter including the entire baryon octet at finite temperature, based on a fully relativistic mean field model with a consistent treatment of exchange (Fock) terms, using the quark-meson-coupling model (QMC). It has been already demonstrated that the QMC equation of state is applicable in thermodynamic scenarios in stationary and rotating isentropic proto-neutron stars, producing results in agreement with recent observation. It is also suitable for the simulation of the behavior following a binary neutron star merger [1]; https://compose.obspm.fr/eos/205. We develop a comprehensive demonstration of the impact of the Fock terms in the QMC energy density functional on properties of neutrinoless proto-neutron stars with cores containing the full hyperon octet with constant entropy, S/A=2kB. Given the interest in the properties of the proto-neutron star remaining after either a supernova explosion or the merger of two neutron stars, it is vital to develop modern equations of state at finite temperature. While much attention has been paid to relativistic mean-field calculations at finite temperature, it is crucial to explore the consequences of a consistent treatment of the Fock terms.
