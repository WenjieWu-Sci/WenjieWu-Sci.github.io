2025-09-30, **Dynamical equilibria of fast neutrino flavor conversion**, Jiabao Liu et.al., [2509.26418v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26418v1)

 Dense neutrino systems, which display collectivity mediated by the weak interaction, have deep parallels with mean-field kinetic systems governed by other fundamental forces. We identify analogues in fast flavor conversion (FFC) of some time-honored nonlinear phenomena in plasmas and self-gravitating systems. We focus in particular on nonlinear Landau damping and collisionless equilibria, which are likely important pieces of the unsolved puzzle of neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. Our analysis additionally reveals the previously unexplored phenomenon of flavor-wave synchronization.

2025-09-30, **Precision measurement and modelling of the threshold-free 210Pb β spectrum**, Shuo Zhang et.al., [2509.26390v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26390v2)

 Beta decay is a fundamental process that governs nuclear stability and serves as a sensitive probe of the weak interaction and possible physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. However, precise measurements of complete $\beta$ decay spectra, particularly at low energies, remain experimentally and theoretically challenging. Here we report a high-precision, threshold-free measurement of the full $\beta$ decay spectrum of 210Pb to excited states of 210Bi, using a transition-edge sensor (TES)-based micro-calorimeter. This approach enables the detection of $\beta$ particle energies from 0 keV up to their endpoint by coincidence summing with subsequent de-excitation energy, thereby eliminating reconstruction artifacts near zero energy that have traditionally limited low-energy spectral accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first complete, high-precision $\beta$ decay spectrum from 0 keV. The data resolve theoretical uncertainties associated with the atomic quantum exchange (AQE) effect. An accompanying ab initio theoretical framework, incorporating atomic, leptonic, and nuclear components, predicts a statistically significant (7.2 {$\sigma$}) enhancement in $\beta$ emission probability near zero energy, in agreement with the measurement and in contrast to models that omit AQE corrections. These results provide a new benchmark for $\beta$ decay theory at low energies, deepen our understanding of the weak interaction, and establish a critical foundation for searches for new physics, including dark matter interactions and precision studies of neutrinos.

2025-09-30, **Impact of Evaporation Barriers on Solar-Captured Dark Matter Distributions and Evaporation Mass**, Xuan Wen et.al., [2509.26192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26192v1)

 Dark matter (DM) particles traversing the Sun can lose energy through elastic scattering with solar nuclei and become gravitationally captured. For DM with masses below a few GeV, however, evaporation caused by collisions with hot nuclei efficiently ejects particles, preventing their long-term accumulation. This defines a minimum mass threshold, typically around a few GeV, below which the Sun cannot retain DM. In this work, we investigate how an additional evaporation barrier - arising either from multiple scattering in an optically thick regime or from a long-range DM-nucleon interaction - modifies this equilibrium. We compute the transport and thermalization of captured DM using a phase-space approach that evolves the orbital distribution rather than assuming a Maxwellian form. Without a barrier, we recover the standard result that evaporation dominates for sub-few-GeV DM, leading to negligible net retention. With a barrier, however, the escape of light DM is strongly suppressed, enabling the Sun to capture and retain particles below the canonical evaporation mass. The barrier effectively raises the escape threshold, either through repeated scatterings or through an additional long-range attractive potential. We present the resulting phase-space distributions, density and velocity profiles, and highlight how the suppression of the high-velocity tail drives the captured population closer to thermal equilibrium with the solar core. These modifications increase the equilibrium abundance of light DM by orders of magnitude and have direct implications for solar neutrino searches as an indirect probe of DM.

2025-09-30, **Cosmological constraints on non-phantom dynamical dark energy with DESI Data Release 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations: A 3$σ$+ lensing anomaly**, Shouvik Roy Choudhury et.al., [2509.26144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26144v1)

 We consider a 12-parameter cosmological model with non-phantom dynamical dark energy (NPDDE), where non-phantom implies that the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy (DE), $w(z)\geq-1$ for all redshifts $z$. Thus, the DE EoS covers the parameter space corresponding to the popular single scalar-field dark energy models, i.e., Quintessence. The cosmological model comprises 6 parameters of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, and additionally the dynamical DE EoS parameters ($w\_0$, $w\_a$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A\_{\rm lens}$), sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m\_\nu$), the effective number of non-photon relativistic degrees of freedom ($N\_{\rm eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha\_s$). We derive constraints on the parameters by combining the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from Planck Public Release (PR) 4, CMB lensing data from Planck PR4 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL) data from DES Year 1. Our major finding is that with CMB+BAO+WL and CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, we find 3$\sigma$+ evidence for $A\_{\rm lens} >1$, indicating a higher than expected CMB lensing amplitude relative to the NPDDE prediction of unity. This implies that for cosmology to accommodate realistic quintessence-like dark energy models (as opposed to unrealistic phantom DE), one would also need to explain a relatively significant presence of the lensing anomaly.

2025-09-30, **Efficient tau-pair invariant mass reconstruction with simplified matrix element techniques**, Artur Kalinowski et.al., [2509.26069v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26069v1)

 The quality of the invariant mass reconstruction of the di-{\tau} system is crucial for searches and analyses of di-{\tau} resonances. Due to the presence of neutrinos in the final state, the {\tau} {\tau} invariant mass cannot be calculated directly at hadron colliders, where the longitudinal momentum sum constraint cannot be applied. A number of approaches have been adopted to mitigate this issue. The most general one uses Matrix Element (ME) integration for likelihood estimation, followed by invariant mass reconstruction as the value maximizing the likelihood. However, this method has a significant computational cost due to the need for integration over the phase space of the decay products. We propose an algorithm that reduces the computational cost by two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the resolution of the invariant mass reconstruction at a level comparable to the ME-based method. Moreover, we introduce additional features to estimate the uncertainty of the reconstructed mass and the kinematics of the initial {\tau} leptons (e.g., their momenta).

2025-09-30, **Search for UHE neutrinos from GRBs with the Pierre Auger Observatory**, Yago Lema-Capeans et.al., [2509.25962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25962v1)

 We report on the search for ultra-high-energy neutrinos from the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using Surface Detector (SD) data from Phase I of the Pierre Auger Observatory (2004-2021). A total of 570 GRBs occur within the most neutrino-sensitive field of view of the SD, considering both Earth-skimming and downward-going detection channels. For this purpose, GRB neutrino emission has been modeled using the numerical software NeuCosmA, incorporating gamma-ray measurements and inferred parameters such as the jet Lorentz factor and the minimum variability time scale. No neutrino candidates were found, and upper limits were obtained by stacking the individual GRB neutrino fluences. These limits are complementary to those of IceCube and ANTARES and provide the strongest constraints on prompt GRB neutrino fluence above $10^{18}$ eV. Additionally, limits on GRB fluence in alternative models of neutrino production have been derived using Auger data.

2025-09-30, **The REDTOP experiment: a $η/η^{\prime}$ factory to explore dark matter and physics beyond the Standard Model**, Marcin Zielinski et.al., [2509.26552v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26552v1)

 The REDTOP experiment is a proposed super-$\eta$/$\eta'$ factory aimed at exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in the MeV-GeV range and rare $\eta$/$\eta'$ meson decays. With projected production rates exceeding $10^{13}$ $\eta$/year and $10^{12}$ $\eta'$/year, REDTOP will enable studies of symmetry violations and all four portals to the Dark Sector. Preliminary studies show sensitivity, which could open a broad possibility for exploring new physics and contribute to a deeper understanding of fundamental interactions within the Standard Model. Such high statistics experiments and the required sensitivity can only be achieved with a high intensity proton or pion beam, available at several accelerator facilities worldwide. This article discusses the physics potential of the REDTOP experiment, the detector design, and the future beam requirements.

2025-09-30, **Supersymmetric Axionic model in N = 1 Wess-Zumino gauge from CFJ approach**, C. Roldán-Domínguez et.al., [2509.26089v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26089v1)

 The main purpose behind this work has been to construct a Supersymmetric extension of Axionic Electrodynamics based on a Lorentz Symmetry-Violating framework. Thus, in addition to the axion and the photon, our model naturally incorporates its supersymmetric partners - the axino and the photino - and allows for the interaction between them. This enriches the Axionic Electrodynamics not only from a theoretical standpoint but also for its phenomenological relevance, providing additional interactions between possible dark matter candidates.

2025-09-30, **The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited: II. Rotational Halo Properties**, Eduard Salvador-Solé et.al., [2509.26081v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26081v1)

 The peak model of structure formation was built more than fifty years ago with the aim to address the origin of dark matter halo rotation in the tidal torque theory (TTT). Paradoxically, it has allowed one to explain and reproduce all halo properties found in cosmological simulations except their rotation, which remains to be understood. With the present two Papers we remedy this anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order, their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results obtained explain and reproduce the rotational properties of simulated halos.

2025-09-30, **Signatures of dark subhalos in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: I. Fluctuations in surface density**, Eduardo Vitral et.al., [2509.26056v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26056v1)

 Dark matter (DM) subhalos offer critical tests of cosmological models through their abundance and properties, yet most remain undetectable due to their lack of stars. We investigate whether their presence leaves measurable imprints on the projected stellar density fields of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Building on literature $N$-body experiments, we show that subhalo interactions induce subtle out-of-equilibrium fluctuations appearing as density corrugations. In a CDM framework, these fluctuations are dominated by the most massive subhalos in the host halo. We develop a Fourier-based framework to quantify these features, identifying characteristic peaks in the spatial frequency spectrum that are well described by Voigt profiles. The peak parameters are sensitive to both the subhalo mass function and the number of stellar tracers. For the configurations tested, $N\_{\star} \sim 10^5$ stars suffice to detect subhalo populations with $M\_{\rm subhalo} \lesssim 10^6~\mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$, while larger masses produce stronger and more complex signatures. We assess the feasibility of this technique by analyzing Gaia and HST data: in this context, the Fornax dwarf shows residual low-frequency structures resembling those in our controlled subhalo experiments, making it an interesting case for follow-up. Prospectively, wide-field surveys such as Euclid, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are expected to deliver stellar samples of $N\_{\star} \sim 10^5$ per dwarf, offering compelling prospects for probing subhalo imprints. Our results introduce a novel pathway to constrain the subhalo mass function in dSphs, and motivate follow-up work that incorporates alternative DM models and additional dynamical perturbations.

2025-09-30, **Searching for Dark Structures: A Comparison of Weak Lensing Convergence Maps and Lensing-Weighted Galaxy Density Maps**, Soojin Kim et.al., [2509.25836v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25836v1)

 We present the result of a comparison between the dark matter distribution inferred from weak gravitational lensing and the observed galaxy distribution to identify dark structures with a high dark matter-to-galaxy density ratio. To do this, we use weak lensing convergence maps from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, and construct corresponding galaxy convergence maps at $z\lesssim1.0$, representing projected galaxy number density fluctuations weighted by lensing efficiency. The two maps show overall agreement. However, we could identify 22 regions where the dark matter density exhibits an excess compared to the galaxy density. After carefully examining the survey depths and proximity to survey boundaries, we select seven of the most probable candidates for dark structures. This sample provides valuable testbeds for further investigations into dark matter mapping. Moreover, our method will be very useful for future studies of dark structures as large-scale weak-lensing surveys become available, such as the $\textit{Euclid}$ mission, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

2025-09-30, **Effect of dark matter halo environment on GW memory signal**, Soumya Bhattacharya et.al., [2509.25819v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25819v1)

 In this paper, we study the gravitational wave (GW) memory effect for a black hole embedded in a dark matter halo described by a Hernquist-type density profile, both with and without a spike. We first solve the geodesic equations in this spacetime under the influence of a GW pulse to examine how the combined effects of the dark matter halo and the GW pulse modify the geodesic deviation equation and particle trajectories. We then investigate how the memory effect manifests in the waveform in the presence of the dark matter halo. To do that, we analyze the memory contribution at asymptotic null infinity using the Bondi-Sachs formalism and, in particular, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) flux balance laws associated with BMS symmetries. This framework allows us to quantify the GW memory contribution to the waveform, incorporate it into the ringdown waveform templates, and thereby provide a possible avenue for extracting information about the dark matter halo parameters.

2025-09-30, **On the shape of pancakes: catastrophe theory and Gaussian statistics in 2D**, Abineet Parichha et.al., [2509.25608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25608v1)

 Cold dark matter (CDM) can be thought of as a 2D (or 3D) sheet of particles in 4D (or 6D) phase-space due to its negligible velocity dispersion. The large-scale structure, also called the cosmic web, is thus a result of the topology of the CDM manifold. Initial crossing of particle trajectories occurs at the critical points of this manifold, forming singularities that seed most of the collapsed structures. The cosmic web can thus be characterized using the points of singularities. In this context, we employ catastrophe theory in 2D to study the motion around such singularities and analytically model the shape of the emerging structures, particularly the pancakes, which later evolve into halos and filaments-the building blocks of the 2D web. We compute higher-order corrections to the shape of the pancakes, including properties such as the curvature and the scale of transition from their C to S shape. Using Gaussian statistics (with the assumption of Zeldovich flow) for our model parameters, we also compute the distributions of observable features related to the shape of pancakes and their variation across halo and filament populations in 2D cosmologies. We find that a larger fraction of pancakes evolve into filaments, they are more curved if they are to evolve into halos, are dominantly C-shaped, and the nature of shell-crossing is highly anisotropic. Extending this work to 3D will allow testing of predictions against actual observations of the cosmic web and searching for signatures of non-Gaussianity at corresponding scales.

2025-09-30, **Exploring cosmological constraints on galaxy formation time**, Agripino Sousa-Neto et.al., [2509.26611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26611v1)

 The Universe consists of a variety of objects that formed at different epochs, leading to variations in the formation time which represents the time elapsed from the onset of structure formation until the formation time of a particular object. In this work, we present two approaches to reconstruct and constrain the galaxy formation time $t\_f(z)$ using non-parametric reconstruction methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GP) and High-performance Symbolic Regression (SR). Our analysis uses age estimates of 32 old passive galaxies and the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and considers two different values of the Hubble constant $H\_0$ from the SH0ES and Planck Collaborations. When adopting the $\Lambda$CDM model and the GP reconstructions, we find $\left<t\_f\right>=0.72\_{-0.16}^{+0.14}$ Gyr (SH0ES) and $\left<t\_f\right>=1.26\_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$ Gyr (Planck). Without considering a specific cosmological model, we obtain $\left<t\_f\right>=0.71 \pm {0.19}$ Gyr (SH0ES) and $\left<t\_f\right> = 1.35\_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$ Gyr (Planck). Similar values are obtained from the SR reconstructions, with both methods (GP and SR) indicating the same behavior regarding the time evolution of $t\_f(z)$. The results also show significant differences in the formation time from SH0ES and Planck values, highlighting the impact of the $H\_0$ tension on the cosmological estimates of $t\_f(z)$. In particular, the different approaches used in the analysis agree with each other, demonstrating the robustness and consistency of our results. Overall, this study suggests that galaxies have different evolutionary timescales and that $t\_f$ is not constant, with noticeable variations at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 0.5$).

2025-09-30, **Tests of Evolving Dark Energy with Geometric Probes of the Late-Time Universe**, Kunhao Zhong et.al., [2509.26480v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26480v2)

 Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have shown a strong statistical preference for a time-evolving dark energy model over $\Lambda$CDM when combining BAO, CMB, and supernova (SN) data. We investigate the robustness of this conclusion by isolating geometric information in weak lensing measurements from the DES Year 3 survey and combining it with different datasets. We introduce a hyperparameter, $\Omega\_{\rm m}^{\rm growth}$, to decouple the growth contribution from the lensing 2-point correlation and thus bypass the possible effect of the $\sigma\_8$ tension in our analysis. We then combine with the late-time geometric probes provided by BAO and SN, along with CMB primary data. The preference for evolving dark energy is consistent with the DESI-DR2 findings: when combining BAO, primary CMB, and weak lensing data, the $w\_0w\_a$CDM is preferred at about the $3\sigma$ significance. However, when we add SN, the result is sensitive to the choice of data: if we leave out $z<0.1$ SN data in the analysis, as a test of the effect of inhomogeneous calibration, we obtain a statistical significance below $2\sigma$ for time evolving dark energy. Indeed, the high-z only SN data \textbf{lowers} the evidence for evolving dark energy in all the data combinations we have examined. This underscores the importance of improved SN samples at low redshift and of alternative data combinations. We show that cosmic shear measurements with LSST Year 1 data will provide comparable power to current SN data. We discuss other low-redshift probes provided by lensing and galaxy clustering to test for evolving dark energy.

2025-09-30, **Stereo observations of CTA 1 with SST-1M**, Bastien Lacave et.al., [2509.26068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26068v1)

 CTA~1 is a composite supernova remnant featuring a shell structure and an inner Pulsar Wind Nebula. The shell is visible in the radio band, while Fermi has detected the radio-quiet pulsar PSR J0007+7303 at its core. Gamma-ray detectors such as LHAASO and VERITAS have detected TeV emission in the vicinity of the pulsar. However, the derived SEDs from LHAASO WCDA and VERITAS show significant discrepancies, which could be due to a complicated energy-dependent morphology not accounted for in the spectral analysis, and different angular resolution of the two experiments. CTA~1 has been a target for dedicated observations by the SST-1M telescopes, a pair of small-sized Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) capable of operating in both mono and stereo modes. Located at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory in Czech Republic, these telescopes are sensitive to the high energy range of the gamma-ray spectrum, spanning from 1 to 300 TeV. To investigate the very high-energy emission of CTA~1, the SST-1Ms have accumulated approximately 30 hours of selected observations, aiming to further constrain the characteristics of the source's high energy emission, and to shed some light into the discrepancy between different experiments.

2025-09-30, **Empirical Validation: Investigating the $Λ_s $CDM Model with new DESI BAO Observations**, Manish Yadav et.al., [2509.26049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26049v1)

 The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, offering an elegant and successful framework for interpreting a wide range of cosmological observations. However, the rise of high-precision datasets has revealed statistically significant tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S\_8$ discrepancy, which challenge the completeness of this standard model. In this context, we explore the $\Lambda\_{\rm s}$CDM model-an extension of $\Lambda$CDM featuring a single additional parameter, $z\_\dagger$, corresponding to a sign-switching cosmological constant. This minimal modification aims to alleviate key observational tensions without compromising the model's overall coherence. Recent findings present in the literature indicate that the $\Lambda\_{\rm s}$CDM model not only provides a better fit to Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data for $z\_\dagger < 2.3$, but also accommodates both the SH0ES measurement of $H\_0$ and the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface when 2D BAO data are included. We present a comprehensive analysis combining the full Planck 2018 CMB data, the Pantheon Type Ia Supernovae sample, and the recently released Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our finding reveal that the Preliminary DESI results, a possible $3.9\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM expectations, reinforce the importance of exploring such dynamic dark energy frameworks. In sum, our study underscores the potential of $\Lambda\_{\rm s}$CDM to reconcile multiple cosmological tensions and sheds light on the role of upcoming high-precision observations in reshaping our understanding of the universe's expansion history and the nature of dark energy.

2025-09-30, **The Formation of Neutron Star Systems through Electron-capture Supernovae: A Review**, Bo Wang et.al., [2509.25915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25915v1)

 It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit, leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. However, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (including He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (including the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects, and some observational constraints, etc. We also discuss the formation of double NSs through NS+He star binaries, in which the He star companion experiences an EC-SN. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.

2025-09-30, **A Photometric Classifier for Tidal Disruption Events in Rubin LSST**, Kunal Bhardwaj et.al., [2509.25902v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25902v1)

 Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are astrophysical phenomena arising when stars are disrupted by supermassive black holes. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), with its unprecedented depth and cadence, will detect thousands of TDEs, motivating the need for robust photometric classifiers capable of efficiently distinguishing these events from other extragalactic transients. We aim to develop and validate a machine learning pipeline for photometric TDE identification in LSST-scale datasets. Our classifier is designed to provide high precision and recall, enabling the construction of reliable TDE catalogs for multi-messenger follow-up and statistical studies. Using the second Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC2) dataset, we fit Gaussian Processes (GP) to light curves for feature extraction (e.g., color, rise/fade times, GP length scales). We then train and tune boosted decision-tree models (XGBoost) with a custom scoring function emphasizing high-precision recovery of TDEs. Our pipeline is tested on a diverse simulation of transient and variable events, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and superluminous supernovae. We achieve high precision (up to 95%) while maintaining competitive recall (about 72%) for TDEs, with minimal contamination from non-TDE classes. Key predictive features include post-peak colors and GP hyperparameters, reflecting characteristic timescales and spectral behaviors of TDEs. Our photometric classifier provides a practical and scalable approach to identifying TDEs in forthcoming LSST data. By capturing essential color and temporal properties through GP-based feature extraction, it enables efficient construction of clean TDE candidate samples.

2025-09-30, **Turbulent Magnetic Fields and Molecular Cloud Interactions in the Supernova Remnant G1.9+0.3**, Moeri Tao et.al., [2509.25833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25833v1)

 We present on results of a spatially resolved spectral analysis of G1.9+0.3, the youngest known supernova remnant in the Galaxy. The X-ray spectra are well described by synchrotron emission from a power-law electron distribution with an exponential cutoff. We found a cutoff energy $\epsilon\_0 \sim 1 ~ \rm{keV}$ in both the radio bright rim and the X-ray bright rims. In the loss-limited case, the cutoff energy depends on the shock velocity $v\_{\rm{sh}}$ and the Bohm factor $\eta$, following the relation $\epsilon\_0 \propto v\_{\rm{sh}}^2 \eta^{-1} $. Our analysis shows that $\eta$ ranges from 2 to 4 in the radio rim and from 12 to 15 in the X-ray rims. This suggests that the magnetic field in the radio rim is more turbulent than in the X-ray rims. The presence of CO clouds along the radio rim likely contributes to this difference. Interaction between the shock and these clouds can slow the shock down and generate turbulent eddies. The resulting turbulence eddies can amplify the magnetic field. We propose that the strong radio emission from the radio rim is primarily due to this amplified magnetic field. In contrast, a CO cloud located in the south-west appears to lie in the foreground, as indicated by its low turbulence and the absence of shock deceleration.

2025-09-30, **Updated observational constraints on $φ$CDM dynamical dark energy cosmological models**, Chan-Gyung Park et.al., [2509.25812v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25812v1)

 We present updated observational constraints on the spatially flat $\phi$CDM model, where dark energy is described by a minimally coupled scalar field $\phi$ with an inverse power-law potential $V=V\_0 \phi^{-\alpha}$. Using Planck 2018 CMB temperature, polarization (P18), and lensing power spectra (lensing), along with a compilation of non-CMB data including baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, Hubble parameter, and growth rate measurements, we constrain $\phi$CDM and $\phi$CDM+$A\_L$ models where $A\_L$ is the CMB lensing consistency parameter. The scalar field parameter $\alpha$, which governs dark energy dynamics, is more tightly constrained by non-CMB data than by CMB data alone. For the full dataset, we obtain $\alpha = 0.055 \pm 0.041$ in the $\phi$CDM model and $\alpha = 0.095 \pm 0.056$ in the $\phi$CDM+$A\_L$ model, mildly favoring evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant by $1.3\sigma$ and $1.7\sigma$. The Hubble constant is $H\_0=67.55\_{-0.46}^{+0.53}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $\phi$CDM model, consistent with median statistics and some local determinations, but in tension with other local determinations. The constraints for matter density and clustering amplitude ($\Omega\_m = 0.3096 \pm 0.0055$, $\sigma\_8 = 0.8013\_{-0.0067}^{+0.0077}$) of the flat $\phi$CDM model statistically agree with $\Lambda$CDM model values. Allowing $A\_L$ to vary reduces tensions between CMB and non-CMB data, although we find $A\_L = 1.105 \pm 0.037$, $2.8\sigma$ higher than unity, consistent with the excess smoothing seen in Planck data. Model comparison using AIC and DIC indicates that the $\phi$CDM model provides a fit comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, with the $\phi$CDM+$A\_L$ slightly preferred. Overall, while the $\Lambda$CDM model remains an excellent fit, current data leave open the possibility of mildly evolving quintessence-like dynamical dark energy.
