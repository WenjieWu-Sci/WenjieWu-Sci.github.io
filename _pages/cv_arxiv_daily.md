2025-09-17, **SkyNET-scape Room: An Escape Room to Explore Astroparticle Physics**, Elisa Prandini et.al., [2509.14190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14190v1)

 Innovative science communication is key to engaging the public with complex topics such as astroparticle physics. As part of the Italian PRIN 2022 funding initiative, we are developing SkyNET-scape Room, an interactive escape room designed to introduce participants to the main messengers of the high-energy universe, namely cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos.   The experience is structured into three interactive stations, each focusing on a specific messenger and its detection method. Small teams of visitors will collaborate to solve puzzles and quizzes related to gamma-ray observations, neutrino detection, and cosmic-ray composition. Using a combination of audio, video, and written materials, participants will engage with real scientific concepts while working together to "escape." The ultimate goal is to spark curiosity, teamwork, and excitement for science, making astroparticle physics more accessible and engaging.   In this contribution, we will present the design, implementation, and preliminary feedback from test sessions, emphasizing how gamification and interactive storytelling can serve as powerful tools for public engagement.

2025-09-17, **Long-Lived Particles from Meson and Muon Decays at Rest at Spallation Sources**, Matheus Hostert et.al., [2509.14085v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14085v1)

 We provide a systematic survey of spallation sources around the world and their potential to search for new light particles. We study the sensitivity of existing neutrino detectors to the decay in flight of light particles produced in the decay at rest of pions, muons, and kaons. At J-PARC, we show that the magnetized gaseous argon detectors of ND280 could place leading limits on light particles decaying to $e^+e^-$ and that the liquid-scintillator detectors of the J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at the JSNS (JSNS$^2$) experiment can exploit double- and triple-coincidence signals from $\mu^+\mu^-$ and $\pi^+\pi^-$ to place new limits on particles produced in kaon decay. We find that the Coherent Captain Mills detector at Los Alamos and the suite of COHERENT detectors at Oak Ridge, despite their smaller size, would also have a promising sensitivity to particles produced in pion and muon decays, depending on background levels. Spallation sources have the potential to explore more than an order of magnitude beyond current constraints in some new physics models, encouraging further study on data acquisition and background rejection by experimental collaborations.

2025-09-17, **MEC-induced two-nucleon emission in neutrino-nucleus scattering**, M. B. Barbaro et.al., [2509.13915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13915v1)

 Meson-exchange currents (MEC) play a crucial role in the nuclear response to a leptonic probe, inducing the emission of two nucleons, the so-called 2p2h excitations. Here we report the results of our recent work \cite{Belocchi:2025eix}, in which we evaluated the 2p2h contribution to the $(\nu\_\mu,\mu^-p)$ neutrino cross section off a carbon target, which involves the simultaneous detection the outgoing muon and a proton in the final state. This process has recently been measured in long-baseline neutrino experiments, but no truly microscopic calculation for the 2p2h channel existed to be compared with these data until now. The calculation employs fully relativistic two-body currents and is carried out within the Relativistic Fermi Gas framework. It provides a generalization to the weak sector of the electromagnetic inclusive model developed in Ref.~\cite{DePace:2003spn} and an extension of the calculation to enable semi-inclusive predictions. A selection of our results for the semi-inclusive cross section versus the emitted proton variables is presented, both at fixed neutrino energy and folded with the T2K muon-neutrino flux.

2025-09-17, **Scheduling follow-up observations of energetic transients with the neutrino target scheduler (NuTS)**, Tobias Heibges et.al., [2509.13844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13844v1)

 Space missions offer unique opportunities for studying ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays and neutrinos by leveraging secondary emissions generated by extensive air showers (EAS) resulting from their interactions with the atmosphere or Earth's crust. Detecting UHE neutrinos associated with transient sources holds great potential for unraveling the origins of UHE cosmic rays and the physical processes driving their production. Stratospheric balloon missions, illustrated recently by the Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon II Mission, serve as crucial precursors to space missions. Due to slewing abilities of their telescopes, they can perform follow-up observations of transient sources foreseen as potential candidates for detectable UHE neutrino emissions. Strategies tailored to stratospheric and space missions are essential for optimizing follow-up observations aimed at detecting these elusive neutrinos for the first time. To address this challenge, we have developed a flexible software dedicated to scheduling transient source observations. The software comprises three main modules: a listener module that aggregates alerts from existing alert systems to construct a comprehensive source database, an observability module that factors in the detection system's properties and trajectory to determine a list of observable sources during a specific timeframe, and a scheduler module that prioritizes observations and proposes an optimized observation schedule. The initial release of the neutrino target scheduler software is tailored to the requirements of stratospheric balloon missions, with mock observation examples provided for various flight scenarios. This version will be employed for the upcoming PBR flight in 2027. Future developments will extend its capabilities, and ensure its relevance for various types of missions.

2025-09-17, **Polar Mounds on Strangeon Stars: the Neutrino Emission from Ultraluminous X-ray Pulsars**, Hong-Bo Li et.al., [2509.13732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13732v1)

 Ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) serve as unique astrophysical laboratories, offering critical insights into accretion physics under extreme conditions, such as strong magnetic fields and super-Eddington accretion rates. Additionally, the nature of pulsars, i.e., the equation of state of supranuclear matter, is still a matter of intense debate, basing on either conventional neutron stars or strange stars in the litterateurs. In this work, we investigate accretion columns of ULXPs based on the strangeon-star model, focusing on the thermal mound at the column base. Accounting for Coulomb and strangeness barriers of the strangeon stars, we find that the mound can reach $0.7-0.95\,\rm km$ in height with temperatures above $10^9\, \rm K$, enabling substantial neutrino emission via electron-positron annihilation. Heat transport along the strangeon star surface contributes a luminosity of $10^{36} \, \rm erg\, s^{-1} $, independent of the accretion rate. At low accretion rates ($< 10^{20}\, \rm g\,s^{-1}$), photons dominate the luminosity, while at higher rates ($> 10^{21}\, \rm g\, s^{-1}$), photon trapping makes neutrino emission the main cooling channel, with total luminosity exceeding photon emission, which saturates near $10^{41}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Estimating neutrino fluxes at Earth, we find that only the nearest ULXP, Swift J0243.6$+$6124, could produce a marginally detectable signal, while most extragalactic sources remain well below background levels. These results emphasize the key role of the thermal mound and strangeon star properties in determining accretion luminosities and neutrino emission, offering insights for future modeling and observations of ULXPs.

2025-09-16, **Elastic and Spin-Changing Cross Sections of Spin-Polarized Atomic Tritium**, M. G. Elliott et.al., [2509.13426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13426v1)

 The rates of elastic and inelastic scattering processes of spin-polarized atomic tritium are vital inputs for the design and operation of experiments using cold, magnetically trapped tritium atoms. Elastic scattering dominates the total cross section and dictates the thermophysical properties of the vapor, determining the efficiency of magnetic evaporative cooling and the fluid dynamical properties of the trapped atom cloud. Spin-changing cross sections in both exchange and dipolar channels determine the trap lifetime of the various hyperfine states, imposing constraints on the required atomic tritium supply rate to maintain a given trap density. Motivated by the needs of next-generation spectrometers that will study the tritium beta endpoint to infer the mass of the neutrino, we present new calculations of the elastic, spin-exchange and dipolar cross sections for spin polarized atomic tritium. Cross sections and rate constants are reported for magnetic field strengths of 0-10 T and temperatures from 0-100~K in all relevant Zeeman-hyperfine channels for both tritium and hydrogen. Results are bench-marked against past calculations for atomic hydrogen and the limited available results for tritium, and extend far into the regimes where past calculations have not been available.

2025-09-16, **Smallness of neutrino masses and leptogenesis in 331 composite Higgs model**, Roman Nevzorov et.al., [2509.13245v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13245v1)

 We consider 331 composite Higgs model (CHM3) in which the Lagrangian of the strongly coupled sector is invariant with respect to global SU(3)\_C \times SU(3)\times U(1)\_6 symmetry that can originate from SU(6) subgroup of E\_6 and contains the gauge group of the standard model (SM) as a subgroup. The breakdown of the approximate SU(3)\times U(1)\_6 symmetry down to SU(2)\_W\times U(1)\_Y subgroup around the scale f\sim 10 TeV results in a set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs doublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is discussed. We argue that an approximate discrete Z\_2 symmetry may give rise to tiny masses of the left-handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with masses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the CHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the Higgs doublet and these composite fermions.

2025-09-16, **Probing Geometrical NSI at the DUNE experiment**, Riya Barick et.al., [2509.13205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13205v1)

 In this work, we investigate the implications of a novel non-standard interaction (NSI) of neutrinos. This interaction is geometric in origin -- it arises because the propagation of fermions in curved spacetime induces torsion. This torsion is non-propagating and can be eliminated from the action, resulting in a four-fermion interaction in a torsion-free background. The new interaction modifies the behaviour of the neutrinos passing through matter by introducing additional coupling terms, resulting in a new component in the effective potential. As a result, the neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter are altered. The relevant probabilities are computed using the Cayley-Hamilton formalism. We then explore the potential to probe these torsion-induced NSI in the proposed DUNE experiment. Constraints on the parameters characterizing the torsional effects are obtained. By selecting representative values of torsion parameters to which the DUNE experiment is sensitive, we analyse how these geometric interactions affect the experiment's sensitivity to determine neutrino mass hierarchy, the octant of the 2-3 leptonic mixing angle, and the CP phase. We also examine the new parameter degeneracies introduced by torsion effects and assess their impact on the overall sensitivities of DUNE. We find that the additional parameter degeneracies in the presence of torsion significantly affect the octant sensitivity.

2025-09-16, **Cogenesis of baryon and lepton number asymmetries matching the EMPRESS Data**, Kyu Jung Bae et.al., [2509.13098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13098v1)

 We show that a simple supersymmetric $U(1)\_{B-L}$ extension of the standard model can explain simultaneously the large electron neutrino asymmetry hinted by the recent EMPRESS data as well as the observed tiny baryon number asymmetry via the resonant leptogenesis mechanism. The condensation of $B-L$ Higgs dominating the universe at its decay is the sole source for these generation processes. Here, the infrequent decays of the $B-L$ Higgs to heavy right handed neutrinos and successive prompt decays of these right handed neutrinos around the electroweak phase transition produce the observed baryon number asymmetry, while the complete decay of the same $B-L$ Higgs at a later epoch leads to a large lepton number asymmetry. The right amounts of both asymmetries are found to be obtained for the symmetry-breaking scale $v\_\phi \sim 10^{10}~{\rm GeV}$. Moreover, in a close connection to the positivity of both asymmetries, seemingly only the normal mass hierarchy of light neutrino species works. Finally, the gravitational wave background from the topologically stable strong type-I cosmic strings, generated from the breaking of $U(1)\_{B-L}$ symmetry, can be within the reach of future experiments such as ultimate DECIGO.

2025-09-16, **Physics potential of the IceCube Upgrade for atmospheric neutrino oscillations**, IceCube Collaboration et.al., [2509.13066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13066v1)

 The IceCube Upgrade is an extension of the existing IceCube Neutrino Observatory and will be deployed in the 2025-2026 austral summer. It will significantly improve the sensitivity of the detector to atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The existing 86-string IceCube array contains a dense in-fill known as DeepCore which is optimized to measure neutrinos with energies down to a few GeV. The IceCube Upgrade will consist of seven new densely-instrumented strings placed within the DeepCore volume to further enhance the performance in the GeV energy range. The additional strings will feature new optical modules, each containing multiple PMTs, in contrast to the existing modules that each contain a single PMT. This will more than triple the number of PMT channels with respect to the current IceCube configuration, allowing for improved detection efficiency and reconstruction performance at GeV energies. We describe necessary updates to simulation, event selection, and reconstruction to accommodate the higher data rates observed by the upgraded detector and the addition of multi-PMT modules. We determine the expected sensitivity of the IceCube Upgrade to the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters sin$^2\theta\_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2\_{32}$, the appearance of tau neutrinos and the neutrino mass ordering. The IceCube Upgrade will provide neutrino oscillation measurements that are of similar precision to those from accelerator experiments, while providing complementarity by probing higher energies and longer baselines, and with different sources of systematic uncertainties.

2025-09-16, **Radio detection of Cosmic Rays with the IceCube Surface Array Enhancement**, Megha Venugopal et.al., [2509.13033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13033v1)

 The surface array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, IceTop, measures cosmic rays in the PeV-EeV primary energy range. Stations comprising radio antennas and scintillation detectors will be added to enhance the existing surface detectors. A prototype station, consisting of eight scintillation detectors and three radio antennas, has been in operation in with the instrumentation in final design since the beginning of 2023. Radio signals from air showers are measured by antennas that are read-out when the trigger condition from the scintillation detectors is met. This contribution reports on air-shower coincidence measurements of these radio antennas with IceTop. Geometric shower parameters reconstructed from the radio antennas are compared with those from IceTop to determine the angular resolution. We also present details on the two new stations that were tested, deployed and commissioned with their respective data acquisition systems during the latest field season at the South Pole.

2025-09-16, **Archival Search for IceCube Sub-TeV Neutrino Counterparts to Sub-Threshold Gravitational Wave Events from the Third Observing Run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA**, Tista Mukherjee et.al., [2509.13003v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13003v1)

 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory actively participates in multimessenger follow-ups of gravitational-wave (GW) events. With the release of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue (GWTC)-2.1 and -3, the sub-threshold GW event information from the third observation run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors is publicly available. These sub-threshold GWs are identified via template-based and minimally modelled search pipelines. Neutrino counterparts can enhance their astrophysical significance and improve their localisation. In this contribution, we propose a catalogue-based search for sub-TeV neutrino counterparts to sub-threshold GWs. For this search, we use archival data from IceCube's dense infill array, DeepCore. Using the unbinned maximum likelihood method, we search for correlation between IceCube sub-TeV neutrinos and the $\sim$ 100 most significant sub-threshold GW source candidates. With this study, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts to identify common astrophysical sources of neutrinos and GWs. We present the current status of this search and its role in advancing multimessenger astronomy, paving the way for deeper exploration of GW events and their sources.

2025-09-16, **Muon number reconstruction with IceTop using a two-component lateral distribution function**, Mark Weyrauch et.al., [2509.13002v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13002v1)

 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, situated at the geographic South Pole, comprises both a surface component, IceTop, and a deep in-ice component. This unique setup allows for simultaneous measurements of low-energy ($\sim \rm{GeV}$) and high-energy ($\gtrsim 400\,\rm{GeV}$) muons generated in cosmic-ray air showers. The correlation between these low- and high-energy muons can serve as a valuable tool not only for analyzing cosmic-ray composition but also for tests of hadronic interaction models. However, IceTop does not feature dedicated muon detectors, making it challenging to measure the low-energy muon component for individual air showers. \\ \noindent For this reason, a two-component lateral distribution function is utilized for the simultaneous reconstruction of the primary energy and low-energy muon number on a single-event basis. This is achieved by combining analytical descriptions of the electromagnetic and muon lateral distributions. In this work, the underlying principles of this method will be discussed, as well as its capability for muon number reconstruction using the hadronic interaction models Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC.

2025-09-16, **Investigating the capability of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory to detect gamma-ray emission from simulated stationary neutrino sources identified by KM3NeT**, Gloria Maria Cicciari et.al., [2509.12910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12910v1)

 The simultaneous observation of gamma rays and neutrinos from the same astrophysical source offers a unique opportunity to probe particle acceleration and interaction mechanisms in ultra-high-energy environments. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray facility, sensitive to energies from 20~GeV to 300~TeV. In this work, we present for the first time a performance study of CTAO based on joint simulations of steady-state sources emitting both neutrinos and gamma rays, under the assumption that neutrino events are detected by the KM3NeT telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. To identify potentially observable sources, we apply a neutrino-based selection filter according to KM3NeT's discovery potential. We then simulate gamma-ray detectability with CTAO, taking into account visibility, sensitivity, and extragalactic background light absorption. The analysis is specifically focused on exploring the detectability of sources at low neutrino luminosities, limited to values below $10^{52}\,\mathrm{erg\,yr^{-1}}$, in order to assess the performance of CTAO and KM3NeT in identifying faint extragalactic emitters. Particular attention is given to the strategic role of KM3NeT's geographic location, which provides access to Southern-sky sources, and to the impact of the planned CTA+ upgrade, which will enhance CTAO-South with Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs). Our results highlight the importance of coordinated multi-messenger strategies between KM3NeT and CTAO to maximize the discovery potential of astrophysical neutrino sources.

2025-09-16, **One-loop Renormalization of the Type-I Seesaw Model in the On-shell Scheme**, Jihong Huang et.al., [2509.12844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12844v1)

 In a previous paper arxiv:2507.21691, we have carried out one-loop renormalization of the type-I seesaw model in the modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\rm MS}$) scheme. In the present one, we continue to renormalize the type-I seesaw model in the on-shell scheme. Such an investigation is mainly motivated by the fact that the on-shell scheme has been widely adopted in the renormalization of the standard electroweak theory and implemented for its precision tests. We first specify the physical parameters in the on-shell scheme, and then fix the corresponding counterterms through on-shell renormalization conditions. In the presence of massive Majorana neutrinos, we propose a practical method to determine gauge-independent counterterms for the lepton flavor mixing matrix. With the explicit counterterms in both the $\overline{\rm MS}$ and on-shell schemes, we establish the matching relations of the electric charge, physical masses and flavor mixing matrix elements between these two schemes. Our results in the present and previous papers lay the foundation for precision calculations in the type-I seesaw model.

2025-09-16, **Extreme High-Energy Neutrinos: IceCube vs. KM3NeT**, Lu Lu et.al., [2509.12628v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12628v1)

 We review the state of the art in the detection of extreme high-energy neutrinos, focusing on the IceCube and KM3NeT neutrino telescopes. IceCube, operating deep in Antarctic ice, and KM3NeT, a new array in the Mediterranean Sea, employ distinct designs to capture Cherenkov light from neutrino interactions. We examine their detector architectures, readout and reconstruction performance for PeV-scale and higher-energy neutrinos. Recent candidate events above 5 PeV are highlighted. These include a ~120 PeV muon track observed by KM3NeT in 2023, and IceCube's highest-energy detections, which comprise several-PeV showers and tracks. We outline current approaches to neutrino energy reconstruction and explore scenarios that might explain the apparent differences in observed event characteristics. Finally, we summarize future prospects for extreme-energy neutrino observations and their implications for astrophysical source populations and cosmogenic neutrinos.

2025-09-17, **Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): Exploring the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra-I cluster IV. A study of the Globular Cluster population in four UDGs**, Marco Mirabile et.al., [2509.14206v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14206v1)

 As old stellar systems, globular clusters (GCs) are key fossil tracers of galaxy formation and interaction histories. This paper is part of the LEWIS project, an integral-field spectroscopic survey of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Hydra I cluster. We use MUSE spectroscopy and new VIRCAM $H$-band imaging data to study the GC populations and dark matter content in four dwarf galaxies. We retrieved line-of-sight velocities for all sources in the observed MUSE fields. Since the spectroscopic measurements are limited to relatively bright sources, we developed a multi-band photometric procedure to identify additional GC candidates too faint for spectroscopic confirmation. GC candidates were selected using a combination of photometric properties and morphometric criteria. Additionally, the $H$-band observations were used to constrain the stellar masses of the studied galaxies. Based on the spectroscopic classification, we confirm one GC in UDG3, two in UDG7, and four in UDG11, while UDG9 has no spectroscopically confirmed bright GCs. We identify four intra-cluster GCs in the vicinity of UDG3 and UDG11, and one ultra-compact dwarf with a radial velocity only $\Delta v = -85 \pm 10\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ relative to UDG7, suggesting it may be bound to it. Considering completeness corrections and accounting for possible contamination, from photometry we estimate that the number of GCs ranges between 0 and $\sim40$ for the investigated UDGs. Their specific frequencies suggest that three out of four UDGs are either GC-rich, similar to those in the Coma cluster, or belong to an intermediate population as seen in the Perseus cluster. Dark matter content estimates, inferred from GC counts and stellar mass, indicate that these galaxies are dark-matter dominated, with dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios of $M\_{\mathrm{dyn}} / M\_\star \sim 10-1000$.

2025-09-17, **Blackhole perturbations in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas model**, Sunil Singh Bohra et.al., [2509.14064v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14064v1)

 We study blackhole in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas (MGCG) model, a modified gravity framework proposed to unify dark matter and dark energy. The resulting spacetime is asymptotically non-flat and feature two distinct horizons, determined by the Chaplygin parameter {\alpha}. Observational constraints favor negative values of {\alpha}, which restrict the allowed parameter space. Through linear perturbation analysis, we show that this blackhole remain stable under both scalar and electromagnetic perturbation. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectra depend sensitively on the MGCG parameters, indicating that this cosmological model leaves characteristic imprints on blackhole oscillations. These results suggest that gravitational-wave observations of blackhole ringdowns may provide a means of constraining MGCG and testing unified dark sector scenarios in the strong-field regime.

2025-09-17, **Conditioning halos on the tidal environment for fast and accurate HI power spectra during reionization**, Gaurav Pundir et.al., [2509.13690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13690v1)

 Predicting the statistical properties of the neutral hydrogen (HI) density field during reionization is an important step in using upcoming 21 cm observations to constrain models of reionization. Semi-numerical models of reionization are often coupled with the collapse fraction field $f\_{\text{coll}}(\mathbf{x})$, which determines the fraction of dark matter within halos. In this work, we improve upon earlier prescriptions that compute $f\_{\text{coll}}$ based on the dark matter overdensity $\delta(\mathbf{x})$ alone, to include more information about the environment in the form of eigenvalues of the tidal tensor. We compute the mean of the $f\_{\text{coll}}$ conditioned on these eigenvalues from a set of high-resolution, small-volume simulations and use them to sample the $f\_{\text{coll}}$ field of a low-resolution, large-volume simulation. We subsequently use a semi-numerical code for reionization to compute the HI density field and its power spectrum, and benchmark our results against a reference high-resolution, large-volume simulation. Across variations in redshift, ionized fraction, grid resolution, and minimum halo mass, our method recovers the large-scale HI power spectrum with errors at the $\lesssim 2\%-5\%$ level for $k \lesssim 0.5~ h~ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, providing a substantial improvement over the $\sim 10\%$ results previously obtained using density-only conditioning. Overall, this makes our method a simple yet efficient tool for forward modeling HI maps during reionization.

2025-09-17, **Phase Transition Dynamics Induced by Strong Radio-Frequency Fields in ReBCO High Temperature Superconductors**, Ankur Dhar et.al., [2509.13668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13668v1)

 Probing the dynamics of superconductor phase transitions induced by strong electromagnetic fields is vital to designing high power devices leveraging these materials. The development of high temperature superconductors (HTS) is particularly interesting due to critical temperatures ($T\_c$) approaching 90 K, the ability to support high current densities, and their ability to operate in strong static magnetic fields. This work aims to determine the transition dynamics of these materials at radio-frequencies (rf) in the microwave range where they have enormous potential for new applications ranging from particle accelerators to dark matter searches. We have tested two types of coatings formed from rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO): a film deposited by electron-beam physical vapor deposition, and HTS conductor tapes soldered to a copper substrate with exposed REBCO surfaces. Testing was performed via a hemispherical transverse-electric mode cavity that maximizes the surface rf magnetic field and minimizes the surface electric field on a 2-inch diameter sample. We report on steady-state measurements at low rf power, as well as fully time-resolved transition dynamics on the microsecond timescale seen for the first time with strong surface rf fields.

2025-09-17, **Cosmic Birefringence from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6**, P. Diego-Palazuelos et.al., [2509.13654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13654v1)

 The polarized light of the cosmic microwave background is sensitive to new physics that violates parity symmetry. For example, the interaction of photons with the fields of elusive dark matter and dark energy could cause a uniform rotation of the plane of linear polarization across the sky, an effect known as cosmic birefringence. We extract the cosmological rotation angle, $\beta$, using Bayesian analysis of parity-violating correlations, $EB$ and $TB$, of polarization data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6. We use prior probabilities for instrumental miscalibration angles derived from the optics model for the ACT telescope and instruments, and marginalize over a residual intensity-to-polarization leakage. We measure $\beta = 0.215^\circ\pm 0.074^\circ$ (68\% confidence level), which excludes $\beta=0$ with a statistical significance of $2.9\sigma$. Although there remain systematics in the ACT data that are not understood and do not allow us to draw strong cosmological conclusions, this result is consistent with previous independent results from the \wmap\ and \planck\ missions. It is suggestive that independent data sets and analyses using different methodologies have yielded the same sign and comparable magnitudes for $\beta$.

2025-09-16, **Dark matter annihilation signals from the Large Magellanic Cloud and its impact on the Milky Way**, Evan Vienneau et.al., [2509.13540v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13540v1)

 We study the dark matter (DM) annihilation signals from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the Milky Way (MW) halo, using a MW-LMC analogue from the Auriga magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the gamma-ray signals from DM annihilation from the LMC rises above the MW foreground by a factor of greater than 100 for the s-wave velocity-independent annihilation model, as well as for the Sommerfeld, p-wave, and d-wave velocity-dependent models. We derive upper limits on the annihilation cross section of DM particles in the LMC using Fermi-LAT data for all velocity-dependent cross section models. Bounds for d-wave annihilation are more stringent by $\sim 4-6$ orders of magnitude relative to previous bounds from dwarf galaxies, and for p-wave emission our bounds are $\sim 2-3$ orders of magnitude more stringent. We also demonstrate that the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the MW halo is greatest for the p-wave and d-wave models towards the outer MW halo, while the impact is minimal for Sommerfeld and s-wave models. The LMC boosts the DM density and velocity distribution in the outer MW halo, both by bringing in high-speed DM particles and by accelerating the DM particles of the MW, affecting the DM annihilation signals from the MW for the p-wave and d-wave models.

2025-09-16, **A new perspective on the CMSSM: Yukawa Unification, DM and the SUSY scale**, Stefan Antusch et.al., [2509.13437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13437v1)

 What does third family ($t$-$b$-$\tau$) Yukawa unification, a typical prediction from embedding the Standard Model (SM) fermions in 16-plets of a $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ GUT, imply for the scale of the supersymmetric (SUSY) partners? Which neutralino dark matter (DM) candidate can be realized, and how large is the DM relic density? In this work, we address these questions in a simplified SUSY-breaking framework: the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). To this end, we recast the parameter space of the CMSSM in a way that for all parameter points the SM-like Higgs mass is correctly reproduced. Considering fixed $\tan\beta$ and $\mathrm{sgn}(\mu)$, for every point in the $(x:=\frac{M\_{1/2}}{m\_0},y:=\frac{A\_0}{m\_0})$ parameter plane ranges for all observables are predicted. This provides a new perspective on where in parameter space different types of DM are realized, and which value of the SUSY scale is required in order to explain the observed mass of the SM Higgs boson. In our analysis we consider and compare two strategies: grid scans over the $(x,y,\tan\beta)$ parameter region and MCMC sampling. We find both techniques yield similar results. For $t$-$b$-$\tau$ unification within $5\,\%$ or $10\,\%$, we find $\mu<0$, the SUSY spectrum showing a characteristic pattern, and the SUSY scale around $\mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The extra MSSM Higgses are the lowest lying new states at $\sim 2\div 3\,\mathrm{TeV}$ (with discovery potential at the HL-LHC), the $\mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{TeV}$ stops and gluino are in reach of a possible FCC-hh, while bino DM has a mass above $2.5\,\mathrm{TeV}$, is overabundant, and effectively unobservable in planned direct and indirect detection experiments. The DM relic density requires a dilution factor of $10<\mathcal{D}<1000$, implying non-standard cosmology that could leave its imprints in the stochastic gravitational wave background.

 We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to model mechanical and thermal feedback from AGN onto the evolution of Seyfert-type galaxies, studying the morphology of central galaxies growing within dark matter (DM) halos with masses logM/Mo ~11.8 at z=0. In Paper I, we focused on the end products at z=0, here we analyze evolution for z<10. Black holes (SMBHs) of ~10^6 Mo were seeded at z~9.1 and z~3.7, producing jets along their spin axes. Obtained SMBH accretion rates vary in the range ~0.3-10^(-4) of the Eddington rate. We compared the basic properties of galaxies, such as star formation rate, masses, gas and stellar fractions, bulge-to-disk mass ratios, SMBH masses, etc., over the range of redshifts. Our results indicate that jets and associated over-pressured bubbles have substantial effects on Seyfert galaxy evolution, including properties of the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM and CGM), and even beyond. This feedback can suppress and even quench star formation, reduce stellar mass and gas fraction, modify the bulge-to-disk ratios, drive outflows from galaxies and host DM halos, and metal-enrich the CGM. The jets are largely but not exclusively contained within galaxies. However, over-pressured bubbles cross and modify the composition of the CGM and IGM, their thermodynamic and dynamic state, and generate vorticity. The CGM emerges as a complex region, where action of galactic outflows and jet-formed bubbles combines with the influx from cosmological filaments and diffuse accretion. Ultimately, the above processes affect the gas balance within the galaxy, its morphology, and gas supply to the SMBH, limiting its growth.

 We study how coherent scattering of a background gas off an atom (or other matter) interferometer can lead to enhanced signals from phase shifts and contrast loss. We focus on the inclusion of realistic features of atom interferometers such as finite temperature, cloud substructure, and time-dependent cloud radii. The inclusion of these effects, extending beyond the previously considered point-like cloud approximation, naturally allow us to study the smooth transition between the coherent and incoherent scattering regimes. We discuss how the formalism presented herein can be tested in the lab (with near-infrared photons or an eV-scale electron gun), and discuss an application for the detection of dark matter interacting via long-range forces.

 We reconsider primordial black hole physics in Randall-Sundrum Type-II universes, focusing on constraints from cosmological and astrophysical observables. We pay particular attention to scenarios that allow the entirety of dark matter to be in the form of higher-dimensional primordial black holes. This is possible for a range of AdS radii and black hole masses. Observable constraints are generally modified due to the changes in the higher-dimensional gravitational sector, and come from low-energy $e^{\pm}$ emission, microlensing, and possibly from contributions to unresolved radiation backgrounds. We discuss constraints from the cosmic microwave background due to injection of Hawking quanta into the intergalactic medium. Finally, we comment on recent discussions on the compatibility of higher-dimensional black holes and the KM3-230213A event.

 We demonstrate that Gaia's detection of stars on wide orbits around black holes opens a new observational window on dark matter structures -- such as scalar clouds and dark matter spikes -- predicted in a range of theoretical scenarios. Using precise radial velocity measurements of these systems, we derive state-of-the-art constraints on dark matter density profiles and particle masses in previously unexplored regions of parameter space. We also test the black hole hypothesis against the alternative of a boson star composed of light scalar fields.

2025-09-16, **Revisiting axion dark matter with nonlinear transitions**, Max Miyazaki et.al., [2509.13292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13292v1)

 Recently, two of the present authors showed that even when the axion momentum is much smaller than its mass, the axion can still behave like radiation if its energy density greatly exceeds the maximum potential energy set by the cosine-type potential. As the energy density redshifts down to the potential scale, a nonlinear transition occurs, during which the axion's adiabatic invariant is not conserved. In this paper, we revisit the analysis of axion dark matter by incorporating the effects of this nonlinear transition through a precise study of the axion spectrum. We demonstrate that in the parameter region with a relatively small decay constant, often favored in axion search experiments, special care is required when estimating the axion abundance and spectrum. We also highlight a scenario in which axions are produced through the stimulated decay of a modulus, a situation that may naturally arise in the string axiverse, where the nonlinear transition occurs across a wide parameter region. Furthermore, we discuss related phenomena, including QCD axion dark matter, the formation of axion clumps such as miniclusters and axion stars, gravitational wave production, and formation of primordial black holes as dark matter.

2025-09-16, **Parity in Composite-Field Galaxy Correlators**, Zucheng Gao et.al., [2509.13207v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13207v1)

 Detecting parity violation on cosmological scales would provide a striking clue to new physics. Large-scale structure offers the raw statistical power -- many three-dimensional modes -- to make such tests. However, for scalar observables, like galaxy clustering, the leading parity-sensitive observable is the trispectrum, whose high dimensionality makes the measurement and noise estimation challenging. We present two late-time parity-odd kurto spectra that compress the parity-odd scalar trispectrum into one-dimensional, power-spectrum-like observables. They are built by correlating (i) two appropriately weighted quadratic composite fields, or (ii) a linear and cubic composite field, constructed from dark matter (DM) or galaxy overdensity fields. We develop an FFTLog pipeline for efficient theoretical predictions of the two observables. We then validate the estimators for a specific parity-odd primordial template on perturbative DM field, and on DM and halo fields in full N-body \texttt{Quijote} simulations, with and without parity-odd initial conditions, in real and redshift space. For DM, the variance is dominated by the parity-even contribution -- i.e., the gravitationally induced parity-even trispectrum -- and is efficiently suppressed by phase-matched fiducial subtraction. For halos, discreteness-driven stochasticity dominates and is not appreciably reduced by subtraction; however, optimal weighting and halo-matter cross kurto spectra considerably mitigate this noise and enhance the signal. Using controlled down-sampling of the matter field, we empirically calibrate how the parity-even variance scales with number density and volume, and provide an illustrative forecast for the detectability of parity-odd kurto spectra in a Euclid-like spectroscopic galaxy survey.

2025-09-16, **Euclid preparation. Using mock Low Surface Brightness dwarf galaxies to probe Wide Survey detection capabilities**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2509.13163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13163v1)

 Local Universe dwarf galaxies are both cosmological and mass assembly probes. Deep surveys have enabled the study of these objects down to the low surface brightness (LSB) regime. In this paper, we estimate Euclid's dwarf detection capabilities as well as limits of its MERge processing function (MER pipeline), responsible for producing the stacked mosaics and final catalogues. To do this, we inject mock dwarf galaxies in a real Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) field in the VIS band and compare the input catalogue to the final MER catalogue. The mock dwarf galaxies are generated with simple S\'ersic models and structural parameters extracted from observed dwarf galaxy property catalogues. To characterize the detected dwarfs, we use the mean surface brightness inside the effective radius SBe (in mag arcsec-2). The final MER catalogues achieve completenesses of 91 % for SBe in [21, 24], and 54 % for SBe in [24, 28]. These numbers do not take into account possible contaminants, including confusion with background galaxies at the location of the dwarfs. After taking into account those effects, they become respectively 86 % and 38 %. The MER pipeline performs a final local background subtraction with small mesh size, leading to a flux loss for galaxies with Re > 10". By using the final MER mosaics and reinjecting this local background, we obtain an image in which we recover reliable photometric properties for objects under the arcminute scale. This background-reinjected product is thus suitable for the study of Local Universe dwarf galaxies. Euclid's data reduction pipeline serves as a test bed for other deep surveys, particularly regarding background subtraction methods, a key issue in LSB science.

2025-09-16, **Probing the millisecond pulsar origin of the GeV excess in the Galactic Centre with LISA**, Valeriya Korol et.al., [2509.12998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12998v1)

 The GeV $\gamma$-ray excess observed towards the Galactic Centre remains unexplained. While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading interpretation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of millisecond pulsars has not been ruled out. Testing this hypothesis with electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are strongly affected by scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge.   We construct synthetic populations of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario, in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only $10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA. Nevertheless, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses ($\sim$0.4 M$\_\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions ($\sim$0.9 M$\_\odot$).   LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems. Distinguishing millisecond pulsar binaries from the far more numerous double white dwarfs will be challenging, though LISA detections could provide valuable targets for follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array, enabling a critical test of the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\gamma$-ray excess.

2025-09-16, **Evolution of low surface brightness ultra-thin galaxies: The role of dark matter halo and bar formation on disk thickness**, K. Aditya et.al., [2509.12966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12966v1)

 We investigate how stellar disks sustain their ultrathin structure throughout their evolution. We follow the evolution of ultrathin stellar disks with varying dark matter (DM) halo concentration ($c$) using collisionless $N$-body simulations with \texttt{AREPO}. We test models embedded in steep ($c = 12$), shallow ($c = 2$), and intermediate ($c = 6$) DM concentrations. Our models match the observed structural properties of the stellar disk in the low surface brightness (LSB) ultrathin galaxy FGC~2366, specifically its surface brightness, disk scalelength, and vertical thinness ($h\_{z}/R\_{D} = 0.1$), while excluding gas, allowing us to isolate the effects of DM. The internal disk heating mechanism driven by bars is suppressed in the LSB ultrathin stellar disks regardless of the DM concentration. The ratio of disk thickness ($h\_z$) to scalelength ($R\_D$) remains constant at $\leq 0.1$ throughout their evolution. To clearly establish that the LSB nature of stellar disks is the key to preventing disk thickening, we construct the initial conditions by increasing the stellar mass fraction from $f\_{s} \sim 0.01$ to $0.02$ and $0.04$, respectively, while keeping the total mass equal to $10^{11} M\_\odot$ and $h\_z/R\_D \leq 0.1$ unchanged. We find that models with a higher stellar mass fraction embedded in a shallow DM potential ($c = 2$) form bars and undergo significant disk thickening ($h\_{z}/R\_{D} \gg 0.1$) concurrent with the bar growth. We conclude that if the LSB disks are thin to begin with, they remain so throughout their evolution in isolation, regardless of the concentration of the DM halo.

 New one- and two-loop contributions to the lepton's and nucleon's EDM, which are induced by an axion-like particle dark matter background, are examined. These contributions include effects from CP-violating ALP interactions with photons, leptons and nucleons. The contribution to the EDM is so larger it leads to new constraints on the CP violating couplings of axion-like particles, if the axion-like particle mass is smaller than $10^{-11} $ eV.

2025-09-16, **Revisiting thermodynamics at the outskirts of the Perseus cluster with Suzaku: importance of modeling the Hot Galactic gas**, Kyoko Matsushita et.al., [2509.12624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12624v1)

 The thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) at the outskirts of galaxy clusters provide valuable insights into the growth of the dark matter halo and the heating of the ICM. Considering the results of the soft X-ray background study of non-cluster Suzaku fields, we revisit 65 Suzaku pointing observations of the Perseus cluster in eight azimuthal directions beyond 1 Mpc (0.8 $r\_{500}$). A possible foreground component, whose spectrum is modeled as a 1 keV collisional ionization equilibrium plasma, significantly affects the temperature and density measurements of the ICM in cluster outskirts. The emission measures in the six arms are similar, showing that the radial slopes of temperature and density follow $r^{-0.67\pm0.25}$ and $r^{-2.21\pm 0.06}$, respectively. The radial pressure profile is close to the average profile measured by the Planck satellite. The resulting entropy slope is $\propto r^{0.81\pm 0.25}$, consistent with the theoretical slope of 1.1. The integrated gas fraction, the ratio of the integrated gas mass to the hydrostatic mass, is estimated to be 0.13$\pm$0.01 and 0.18$\pm$0.02 at $r\_{500}$ and $r\_{200}$, respectively, consistent with the cosmic baryon fraction. These results suggest that the ICM at the cluster outskirts is quite regular and close to hydrostatic equilibrium. The remaining two arms show that the emission measure is higher by a factor of 1.5-2, possibly due to accretion from filaments from the large-scale structure. A sudden drop in the emission measure also occurs in a direction toward one of the filaments.

 In this letter, we present a systematic search for the electromagnetic counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) merger candidate GW231109\_235456 by examining all transients reported within the 90% probability region and detected within four days of the merger. While non-detection in $\gamma$-ray, we identify two optical candidates, each associated with and residing in a host galaxy, which locate within 330 Mpc from earth; notably, one of them, AT2023xqy, is located at a distance of $178.6$ Mpc, in good agreement with the estimated distance of the GW candidate ($\sim165^{+70}\_{-69}~\mathrm{Mpc}$). Near the trigger time of GW231109\_235456 (MJD 60257.996), AT2023xqy showed evidence of a $\sim$15-day rise, first detected at $3\sigma$ significance on MJD 60259.097 and confirmed above $5\sigma$ on MJD 60262.088. This was followed by a rapid $\sim$5-day decline and a plateau lasting at least 50 days, with the subsequent decay unobserved due to a data gap. The spatiotemporal coincidences indicate that AT2023xqy could be a candidate for the EM counterpart of BNS merger candidate GW231109\_235456, though its lightcurve is difficult to reconcile with a standard kilonova. We examine two possible scenarios to explain the origin of AT2023xqy, a BNS merger-irrelevant scenario involving a peculiar supernova or a BNS merger-relevant scenario involving a magnetar-powered kilonova under extreme conditions. Follow-up radio observations are strongly encouraged, as they may provide critical insights into the nature of AT2023xqy.

2025-09-17, **Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons destruction in star-forming regions across 42 nearby galaxies**, Oleg V. Egorov et.al., [2509.13845v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13845v1)

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread in the interstellar medium (ISM) of Solar metallicity galaxies, where they play a critical role in ISM heating, cooling, and reprocessing stellar radiation. The PAH fraction, the abundance of PAHs relative to total dust mass, is a key parameter in ISM physics. Using JWST and MUSE observations of 42 galaxies from the PHANGS survey, we analyze the PAH fraction in over 17 000 H II regions spanning a gas-phase oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.0-8.8 (Z ~ 0.2-1.3 Zsun), and ~400 isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). We find a significantly lower PAH fraction toward H II regions compared to a reference sample of diffuse ISM areas at matched metallicity. At 12+log(O/H) > 8.2, the PAH fraction toward H II regions is strongly anti-correlated with the local ionization parameter, suggesting that PAH destruction is correlated with ionized gas and/or hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation. At lower metallicities, the PAH fraction declines steeply in both H II regions and the diffuse ISM, likely reflecting less efficient PAH formation in metal-poor environments. Carefully isolating dust emission from the vicinity of optically-identified supernova remnants, we see evidence for selective PAH destruction from measurements of lower PAH fractions, which is, however, indistinguishable at ~50 pc scales. Overall, our results point to ionizing radiation as the dominant agent of PAH destruction within H II regions, with metallicity playing a key role in their global abundance in galaxies.

2025-09-17, **Fermi-LAT Detected Gamma-ray Emission Likely Associated with SNR Kes 78**, Yun-Zhi Shen et.al., [2509.13812v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13812v1)

 We have analyzed the GeV gamma-ray emission in the region of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 78 using $\sim$16.7 years of Fermi-LAT observations and found that the catalog sources 4FGL J1852.4+0037e and 4FGL J1851.8$-$0007c are better represented as two extended sources modeled as `2Ext'. One of them, designated as E2, is located at R.A.$=282.86^\circ$, Dec.$=-0.11^\circ$ with the 68\% containment radius $R\_{68} = 0.31^\circ$, and is detected with a significance of 15.2$\sigma$ in the 0.2--500 GeV energy range. The gamma-ray emission of source E2 is well described by a log-parabola (LogP) spectral model with spectral index $\Gamma$ = 1.2 and curvature $\beta$ = 0.3. The fitting with electron-proton number ratio $K\_{\rm ep}=0.01$ indicates that the GeV emission of source E2 is dominated by hadronic emission. Given the dense molecular environment surrounding the middle-aged SNR Kes 78, the hadronic scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed GeV emission. The extended source E2 can also be replaced with two point sources. One of them, designated as PTS1, is coincident with the newly discovered PSR J1852$-$0002g within the 68\% positional uncertainty circle, indicating a possible gamma-ray contribution from this PSR. The gamma-ray spectrum of source PTS1 can be well described by a LogP spectral shape. The synchro-curvature radiation model provides a satisfactory spectral fit for source PTS1, suggesting that some of the GeV emission from the Kes 78 region might possibly originate from the magnetosphere of PSR J1852$-$0002g.

2025-09-16, **Effect of temperature on the structure of porous dust aggregates formed by coagulation**, Lucas Kolanz et.al., [2509.13449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13449v1)

 The source of high redshift dust has long been debated. One possible source are the ejecta of pair-instability and core collapse supernovae, but it is uncertain how much newly formed dust can survive the supernova reverse shock and be injected into the interstellar medium. We anticipate the structure of the pre-shocked dust to affect how much of it survives. Yet, the structure of dust formed in supernova is not well understood. We present three-dimensional soft-sphere, dust coagulation simulations aimed at studying the impact of temperature and particle size distribution on the structure of growing dust aggregates. Due to the qualitative nature of the concept of structure, there are many ways to define and quantify it, especially for an irregular aggregate. Thus, we test four metrics commonly used in the literature in order to compare the aggregate properties as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the metrics themselves. Our findings show that higher temperatures result in denser, more compact structures for all metrics tested. Additionally, we find that structures that coagulate from a distribution of particle sizes are denser and more compact than structures formed from identical particles under similar conditions. The latter finding, however, is true for three of the metrics except for the average number of contact points, which has proven to be the least reliable of the four considered metrics.

2025-09-16, **Bayesian Anomaly Detection for Ia Cosmology: Automating SALT3 Data Curation**, S. A. K. Leeney et.al., [2509.13394v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13394v1)

 Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) requires robust quality control of large, heterogeneous datasets. Current data processing often relies on manual, subjective rejection of photometric data, a practice that is not scalable for forthcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We present a Bayesian framework that automates this step by integrating anomaly detection directly into the light curve fitting process. While the framework is model-agnostic and compatible with any spectral energy distribution (SED) model, here we demonstrate its application with the SALT3 model, implemented fully on GPU using \texttt{JAX-bandflux} for computational efficiency. Our method models the probability of each photometric measurement being anomalous with respect to the model, simultaneously inferring the physical supernova parameters and each data point's posterior probability of being a contaminant. Applying this framework to the Hawaii Supernova Flows dataset, we demonstrate its three principal capabilities: (i) robust mitigation of isolated outliers; (ii) automated identification and rejection of entirely corrupted bandpasses; and (iii) preservation of valid data by flagging only specific anomalous points within otherwise usable filters. We also find that contaminants are systematically brighter and bluer, which if uncorrected could bias subsequent cosmological inference.

 We investigate the logarithmic form of $f(Q,T)$ gravity with two different choices of matter Lagrangian such as: $\mathcal{L}\_m = p$ and $\mathcal{L}\_m = -\rho$. The parameters of the model has been constrained using Cosmic Chronometers (CC) in combination with DES-SN5YR and Pantheon$^+$ Type Ia supernova datasets. We have observed that the deceleration parameter shows a smooth transition from deceleration to acceleration phase and the effective equation of state parameter ($\omega$) approaches to $-1$ at late times. The $Om(z)$ diagnostic exhibits a decreasing profile, confirming quintessence-like behavior, and the statefinder analysis demonstrates trajectories that remain near the $\Lambda$CDM fixed point but deviate into the quintessence region. The evolution of the density parameters satisfies the flatness condition, and the predicted age of the Universe lies within $t\_0 \sim 13.7-14.3$ Gyr, consistent with CMB and stellar estimates. The findings indicate that the logarithmic model successfully reproduces the late-time accelerated expansion for both the choices of the matter Lagrangian.

 We study magnetic conversion of ultra-relativistic axion-like particles (ALPs) into photons in compact-star environments, focusing on the hot, transient conditions of core-collapse supernova (SN) remnants and neutron-star mergers (NSMs). We address previously overlooked uncertainties, particularly the suppression caused by ejected matter near the stellar surface, a region crucial to the conversion process. We derive analytical expressions for the transition rate; they reveal the influence of key parameters and their uncertainties. We update constraints using historical gamma-ray data from SN~1987A and find $g\_{a\gamma}<5\times10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for $m\_a\lesssim10^{-9}$ meV. We also forecast sensitivities for a future Galactic SN and for NSMs, assuming observations with Fermi-LAT or similar gamma-ray instruments. We distinguish ALPs -- defined as coupling only to photons and produced via Primakoff scattering -- from axions, which also couple to nucleons and emerge through nuclear bremsstrahlung. We omit pionic axion production due to its large uncertainties and inconsistencies, though it could contribute comparably to bremsstrahlung under optimistic assumptions. For the compact sources, we adopt time-averaged one-zone models, guided by numerical simulations, to enable clear and reproducible parametric studies.

2025-09-16, **How Theory-Informed Priors Affect DESI Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy**, Michael W. Toomey et.al., [2509.13318v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13318v1)

 Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have been interpreted to suggest that dark energy may be evolving. In this work, we examine how prior choices affect such conclusions. Specifically, we study the biases introduced by the customary use of uniform priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters, $w\_0$ and $w\_a$, when assessing evidence for evolving dark energy. To do so, we construct theory-informed priors on $(w\_0, w\_a)$ using a normalizing flow (NF), trained on two representative quintessence models, which learns the distribution of these parameters conditional on the underlying $\Lambda$CDM parameters. In the combined $\textit{Planck}$ CMB + DESI BAO analysis we find that the apparent tension with a cosmological constant in the CPL framework can be reduced from $\sim 3.1\sigma$ to $\sim 1.3\sigma$ once theory-informed priors are applied, rendering the result effectively consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. For completeness, we also analyze combinations that include Type Ia supernova data, showing similar shifts toward the $\Lambda$CDM limit. Taken together, the observed sensitivity to prior choices in these analyses arises because uniform priors - often mischaracterized as "uninformative" - can actually bias inferences toward unphysical parameter regions. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of adopting physically motivated priors to ensure robust cosmological inferences, especially when evaluating new hypotheses with only marginal statistical support. Lastly, our NF-based framework achieves these results by post-processing existing MCMC chains, requiring $\approx 1$ hour of additional CPU compute time on top of the base analysis - a dramatic speedup over direct model sampling that highlights the scalability of this approach for testing diverse theoretical models.

2025-09-16, **Short-Duration Gravitational Wave Burst Detection using Convolutional Neural Network**, Matteo Pracchia et.al., [2509.13241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13241v1)

 Detecting unmodeled gravitational wave (GW) bursts presents significant challenges due to the lack of accurate waveform templates required for matched-filtering techniques. A primary difficulty lies in distinguishing genuine signals from transient noise. Machine learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer promising alternatives for this classification problem. This paper presents a CNN-based pipeline for detecting short GW bursts (duration $< 10~\mathrm{s}$), adapted from an existing framework designed for longer-duration events. The CNN has been trained on core-collapse supernova (CCSN) gravitational waveform models injected into simulated Gaussian noise. The network successfully identifies these signals and generalizes to CCSN waveforms not included in the training set, showing the potential of U-Net architectures for detecting short-duration gravitational wave transients across diverse astrophysical scenarios.

2025-09-16, **Dynamic or Systematic? Bayesian model selection between dark energy and supernova biases**, A. N. Ormondroyd et.al., [2509.13220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13220v1)

 DES-5Y supernovae, combined with DESI BAO, appear to favour Chevallier-Polarski-Linder $(w\_0, w\_a)$ dynamical dark energy over $\Lambda$CDM. arXiv:2408.07175 suggested that this is driven by a systematic in the DES pipeline, which particularly affects the low-redshift supernovae brought in from legacy surveys. It is difficult to investigate these data in isolation, however, as the complicated supernovae pipelines must properly account for selection effects. In this work, we discover that the Bayesian evidence previously found for flexknot dark energy (arXiv:2503.17342) is beaten by a magnitude offset between the low- and high-redshift supernovae. In addition, we find that the possible tension between DES-5Y and DESI is significantly reduced by such an offset. We also take the opportunity to trial Nested Bridge Sampling with Sequential Monte Carlo as an alternative method for calculating Bayes factors.

 We report the discovery of two binary systems, each consisting of a slightly bloated G-type main-sequence star and an unseen companion, identified through photometric data from TESS and radial velocity variation from Gaia. High-resolution spectroscopy confirms orbital periods of 1.37 and 2.67 days with circular orbits. The visible components have masses of $\sim 0.9\,M\_\odot$, while the minimum masses of the unseen companions are $1.073^{+0.058}\_{-0.060} M\_\odot$ and $0.919^{+0.049}\_{-0.051} M\_\odot$, respectively. Assuming tidal synchronization, we estimate the companion masses to be $1.12^{+0.10}\_{-0.08} M\_\odot$ and $1.02^{+0.15}\_{-0.10} M\_\odot$. The absence of detectable spectral features from the companions rules out main-sequence stars of these masses, suggesting that the unseen companions are likely O/Ne or C/O massive white dwarfs. The short orbital periods imply that these systems are post-common envelope binaries. Their subsequent evolution is uncertain, with possible outcomes including cataclysmic variables, Type Ia supernovae, or accretion-induced collapse, depending on the nature of future mass transfer.

2025-09-16, **Large-field CO(1-0) observations toward the Galactic historical supernova remnants: shocked molecular clouds toward the Crab Nebula**, Xuepeng Chen et.al., [2509.12622v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12622v1)

 Using the PMO 13.7m telescope, we present large-field and high-sensitivity CO(1-0) line observations toward the Crab Nebula, in order to better understand the interstellar gas environment of this well-known historical supernova remnant. The CO observations show molecular clouds toward the Crab Nebula at a velocity range from about 0 to 16 km/s. After checking the CO spectra, we find shocked signatures in the clouds extending at a velocity of roughly [5, 11] km/s. These shocked molecular clouds, with an angular distance of about 0.4-0.5 degree toward the Crab Nebula, are located at the shell of a bubble discovered in the GALFA-HI (and HI4PI) images at the same velocity range. The dimension of the bubble is roughly 2.3$\times$2.6 degree and the expansion velocity is about 5 km/s. The kinetic energy referred from the shocked molecular clouds (roughly 3.5$\times$10$^{51}$ erg), together with the HI bubble, support the picture that the Crab Nebula belongs to a typical core-collapse supernova remnant. Nevertheless, due to the large uncertainty in the distance measurement, further observations are needed to verify the physical association between the shocked molecular clouds and the Crab Nebula.
