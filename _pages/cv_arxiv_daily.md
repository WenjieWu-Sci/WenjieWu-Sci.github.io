2024-03-25, **Probing Stellar Clusters from Gaia DR2 as Galactic PeVatrons: I -- Expected Gamma-ray and Neutrino Emission**, Alison M. W. Mitchell et.al., [2403.16650v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16650v1)

 Young & massive stellar clusters (SCs) are a potential source of galactic cosmic rays up to very high energies as a result of two possible acceleration scenarios. Collective stellar winds from massive member stars form a wind-blown bubble with a termination shock (TS) at which particle acceleration to PeV energies may occur. Furthermore, shock acceleration may occur at SNRs expanding inside the bubble. By applying a model of CR acceleration at both the wind TS and SNR shocks to catalogues of known SCs derived from Gaia DR2, we identify the most promising targets to search for evidence of PeVatron activity. Predictions for the secondary fluxes of gamma-ray and neutrino emission are derived based on particle acceleration at the collective wind TS and the subsequent hadronic interactions with the surrounding medium. Predictions from our modelling under baseline and optimistic scenarios are compared to data, finding consistent results. We estimate the detection prospects for future gamma-ray and neutrino experiments. We find that degree-scale angular sizes of the wind-blown bubbles are typical, that may pose a challenge for experimental detection. A shortlist of the most promising candidates is provided, with an anticipated flux range. Of order 10 SCs may be detectable with future facilities, and 1-5 could be currently operating as PeVatrons. Of these, three gamma-ray detected SCs have data within our predicted range. Our model can consistently describe gamma-ray measurements of SC emission. Several further as-yet-undetected SCs offer promising targets for future observations, although the flux range allowed by our model can be large (> factor 10). The large angular size of the wind-blown bubble may lead to low surface brightness emission, worsening the problem of source confusion. Nevertheless, we discuss how further work will help to constrain SCs as PeVatron candidates. (abridged)

2024-03-25, **Investigating the impact of the modeling of Earth structure on the neutrino propagation at ultra-high-energies**, Reinaldo Francener et.al., [2403.16611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16611v1)

 The flux of atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos measured in UHE neutrino detectors is strongly dependent on the description of the propagation and absorption of the neutrinos during the passage through Earth to the detector. In particular, the attenuation of the incident neutrino flux depends on the details of the matter structure between the source and the detector. In this paper, we will investigate the impact of different descriptions for the density profile of Earth on the transmission coefficient, defined as the ratio between the flux measured in the detector and the incoming neutrino flux. We will consider five different models for the Earth's density profile and estimate how these different models modify the target column density and transmission coefficients for different flavors. The results are derived by solving the cascade equations taking into account the NC interactions and tau regeneration. A comparison with approximated solutions is also presented. Our results indicated that the predictions are sensitive to the model considered for the density profile, with the simplified three layer model providing a satisfactory description when compared with the PREM results.

 This review provides a succinct overview of the basic aspects of neutrino physics. The topics covered include: neutrinos in the standard model and the three-neutrino mixing scheme; the current status of neutrino oscillation measurements and what remains to be determined; the seesaw mechanisms for neutrino mass generation and the associated phenomenology, including the leptogenesis mechanism to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe; models for the origin of the pattern of neutrino mixing and lepton masses based on discrete flavour symmetries and modular invariance.

2024-03-24, **Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harboring choked jets**, A. Zegarelli et.al., [2403.16234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16234v1)

 Over the last decade, choked jets have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic signatures is crucial. A choked-jet source is expected harboring in core-collapse supernovae with extended hydrogen envelopes, leading to the release of ultraviolet and optical emission for a few days. The ultraviolet band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future mission satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the chocked source visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic and photohadronic interactions in choked jets, we also investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (as IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with electromagnetic signals coming from shock breakout events. By considering fiducial parameters of the source population and instruments performances, we estimate the maximum redshift up to which ULTRASAT and ZTF are able to detect ultraviolet and optical signals from these explosions, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss coordinated multi-messenger observations among those instruments and high-energy neutrino telescopes. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources enlarging the sample of observed Type II supernovae by around 60%. For optimized multi-messenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at the shock breakout occurrence (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a subsequent follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after.

2024-03-24, **Nonstandard interactions of neutrinos with dense matter**, Parada T. P. Hutauruk et.al., [2403.16061v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16061v1)

 Nonstandard interaction is expected to be a crucial hint to explain the experimental data of neutrino scattering off electrons. In this context, the nonstandard interaction vector and axial-vector couplings are needed to be extracted from recent experiments and a few of them are now available in the literature. With these coupling bounds, in this paper, I explore their impacts on the neutrinos interacting with the free electron gas in dense matter. To this end, I compute and predict the neutrino differential cross section and mean free path in dense matter for all those experimental bounds. Interesting behavior in the neutrino cross sections and mean free path is found for the different nonstandard interaction couplings from different experiment constraints. I also found that the neutrino cross-section and mean free path in the dense matter are very sensitive to values and signs of the nonstandard interaction couplings, leading to different prediction results to the Standard Model cross-section and mean free path.

2024-03-24, **Searches for CEÎ½NS and Physics beyond the Standard Model using Skipper-CCDs at CONNIE**, Alexis A. Aguilar-Arevalo et.al., [2403.15976v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15976v1)

 The Coherent Neutrino-Nucleus Interaction Experiment (CONNIE) aims to detect the coherent scattering (CE$\nu$NS) of reactor antineutrinos off silicon nuclei using thick fully-depleted high-resistivity silicon CCDs. Two Skipper-CCD sensors with sub-electron readout noise capability were installed at the experiment next to the Angra-2 reactor in 2021, making CONNIE the first experiment to employ Skipper-CCDs for reactor neutrino detection. We report on the performance of the Skipper-CCDs, the new data processing and data quality selection techniques and the event selection for CE$\nu$NS interactions, which enable CONNIE to reach a record low detection threshold of 15 eV. The data were collected over 300 days in 2021-2022 and correspond to exposures of 14.9 g-days with the reactor-on and 3.5 g-days with the reactor-off. The difference between the reactor-on and off event rates shows no excess and yields upper limits at 95% confidence level for the neutrino interaction rates comparable with previous CONNIE limits from standard CCDs and higher exposures. Searches for new neutrino interactions beyond the Standard Model were performed, yielding an improvement on the previous CONNIE limit on a simplified model with light vector mediators. A first dark matter (DM) search by diurnal modulation was performed by CONNIE and the results represent the best limits on the DM-electron scattering cross-section, obtained by a surface-level experiment. These promising results, obtained using a very small-mass sensor, illustrate the potential of Skipper-CCDs to probe rare neutrino interactions and motivate the plans to increase the detector mass in the near future.

 We combine the semi-analytical structure formation model, SASHIMI, which predicts subhalo populations in collisionless, cold dark matter (CDM), with a parametric model that maps CDM halos to self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The resulting model, SASHIMI-SIDM, generates SIDM subhalo populations down to sub-galactic mass scales, for an arbitrary input cross section, in minutes. We show that SASHIMI-SIDM agrees with SIDM subhalo populations from high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations in resolved regimes. Crucially, we predict that the fraction of core-collapsed subhalos peaks at a mass scale determined by the input SIDM cross section and decreases toward higher halo masses, consistent with the predictions of gravothermal models and cosmological simulations. For the first time, we also show that the core-collapsed fraction decreases toward lower halo masses; this result is uniquely enabled by our semi-analytical approach. As a proof of principle, we apply SASHIMI-SIDM to predict the boost to the local dark matter density and annihilation rate from core-collapsed SIDM subhalos, which can be enhanced relative to CDM by an order of magnitude for viable SIDM models. Thus, SASHIMI-SIDM provides an efficient and reliable tool for scanning SIDM parameter space and testing it with astrophysical observations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/shinichiroando/sashimi-si.

2024-03-25, **Gravitational waves from domain wall collapses and dark matter in the SM with a complex scalar**, Hieu The Pham et.al., [2403.16568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16568v1)

 We study domain wall induced by spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ symmetry and its gravitational wave signature in the standard model with a complex scalar in connection with dark matter physics. In a minimal setup, a linear term of the singlet field is added to the scalar potential as an explicit $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ breaking term to make the domain wall unstable. We obtain its minimal size from cosmological constraints and show that the parameter space that can be probed by current and future pulsar time array experiments requires the vacuum expectation value of the singlet field to be greater than $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ TeV, along with a singlet-like Higgs mass of $\mathcal{O}(1-100)$ TeV. However, such a region is severely restricted by the dark matter relic density, which places an upper bound on the singlet vacuum expectation value at approximately 200 TeV, and limits the dark matter mass to about half of the singlet-like Higgs boson mass.

2024-03-25, **Galactic dynamics in the presence of scalaron: A perspective from $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ gravity**, Gayatri Mohan et.al., [2403.16522v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16522v1)

 We consider $f(R)$ modified gravity with the chameleon mechanism as an alternative approach to address the dark matter issue on the galactic scale. Metric formalism of $f(R)$ theory is considered in this study. A mathematical transformation tool called conformal transformation which transforms the action from Jordan to Einstein frame is employed to simplify the fourth-order modified field equation and to describe the extra degree of freedom $f\_R$ by using a minimally coupled scalar field (scalaron) showing the chameleonic character. Then, we examine the viability of a newly introduced $f(R)$ gravity model on behalf of the chameleonic behavior of the scalaron. The model analyzes this behavior of the scalaron successfully with the singularity correction. Further, we consider a test particle (star) in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime to investigate the importance of the scalaron in galactic dynamics. In the non-relativistic limit, the rotational velocity equation for the particle with scalaron contribution is derived. This contribution is found to be model dependent. We generate the rotation curves using the velocity equation and fit the predicted curves to observational data of a set of thirty seven sample galaxies of different categories. The curves are fitted based on two fitting parameters $M\_0$ and $r\_c$. The fitting shows good agreement of the prediction with the observed data.

2024-03-25, **Photon orbits and phase transition for Letelier AdS black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter**, Ashima Sood et.al., [2403.16454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16454v1)

 We obtain an exact solution of spherically symmetric Letelier AdS black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). Considering the cosmological constant as the positive pressure of the system and volume as its conjugate variable, we analyse the thermodynamics of our black holes in the extended phase space. Owing to the background clouds of strings parameter ($a$) and the parameter endowed with PFDM ($\beta$), we analyse the Hawking temperature, entropy and specific heat. We also investigate the relationship between the photon sphere radius and the phase transition for the Letelier AdS black holes immersed in PFDM. Through the analysis, we find with a particular condition, there are non-monotonic behaviours between the photon sphere radius, the impact parameter, the PFDM parameter, temperature, and pressure. We can regard both the changes of photon sphere radius and impact parameter before and after phase transition as the order parameter; their critical exponents near the critical point are equal to the same value 1/2, just like ordinary thermal systems. These indicate that a universal relation of gravity may exist near the critical point for a black hole thermodynamic system.

2024-03-24, **Covariant Lagrangian Cubic Interaction Vertices For Irreducible Higher Spin Fields in Minkowski Backgrounds**, Alexander A. Reshetnyak et.al., [2403.16164v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16164v1)

 We review the application of BRST and BRST-BV approaches to construct the generic off-shell local Lorentz covariant cubic interaction vertices for irreducible massless and massive higher integer spin fields (as the candidates for massive particles in the Dark Matter problem) on $d$-dimensional Minkowski spaces. It is shown that equivalence among two Lagrangian dynamics for the same cubically interacting fields with given masses and spins obtained by means of the approach with complete BRST, $Q$, operator and of one with incomplete BRST, $Q\_c$, operator in presence of consistent off-shell holonomic (traceless) constraints can be uplifted from the equivalence of the Lagrangians for free higher spin fields. We found that to get non-contradictory Lagrangians for irreducible interacting higher-spin fields within approach with $Q\_c$ operator, together with off-shell algebraic constraints in addition to necessary condition of superconmmuting of $Q\_c$ with appropriate holonomic constraints on the field and gauge parameter vectors, these constraints should form Abelian superalgebra both with BRST operator above and with operators of cubic vertices.

2024-03-24, **Primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves from the inflation potential with a tiny bump**, Wei Yang et.al., [2403.15979v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15979v1)

 This paper explores the generation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) from the inflation potential with a tiny bump. We propose a Lorentz function that makes a tiny bump characteristic of the inflation model potential. This property makes the scalar field move locally ultra slowly, which not only makes the primordial curvature power spectrum have $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ peaks at a small scale but also satisfies observational constraints of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on a large scale. Specifically, we calculate the abundances of PBHs for different mass ranges in this model, where PBHs with mass $10^{-12}M\_\odot$ can make up almost all dark matter and PBHs with mass $10^{-5}M\_\odot$ can explain OGLE ultrashort-timescale microlensing events. Moreover, we find that SIGWs accompanying the PBHs can be tested by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), TianQin, Taiji, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and DECIGO. As for the parameter set I, the consequent SIGWs can explain the NANOGrav 12.5yrs signal.

2024-03-25, **Self-similar solutions in cylindrical magneto-hydrodynamic blast waves with energy injection at the centre**, Antoine Gintrand et.al., [2403.16675v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16675v1)

 The evolution of shocks induced by massive stars does not depend only on the ambient magnetic field strength, but also on its orientation. In the present work, the dynamics of a magnetized blast wave is investigated under the influence of both azimuthal and axial ambient magnetic fields. The blast wave is driven by a central source and forms a shell that results from the accumulation of interstellar matter behind the shock front. A similarity form of the ambient magnetic field and a cylindrical geometry of the blast wave are assumed to obtain self-similar solutions. The model is studied separately for both azimuthal and axial magnetic field and applied to stellar wind bubbles and supernova remnants respectively, using 1D numerical simulations. We found that the magnetized blast wave differs from the self-similar case without an ambient magnetic field. The forward shock front goes slower in the azimuthal case and faster in the axial one. For both tangential orientations, the thickness of the shell increases with the magnetic strength. In the azimuthal case, the thermal energy can be converted to magnetic energy near the inner boundary of the shell. Thus, the temperature drops and the magnetic field increases at the tangential discontinuity of the stellar wind bubble. In the axial case of a supernova remnant, the numerical solution al w ays follows a special curve in the parameter space given by the self-similar model.

2024-03-25, **Phantom scalar field cosmologies constrained by early cosmic measurements**, JosÃ© Antonio NÃ¡jera et.al., [2403.16562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16562v1)

 In this work, we explore new constraints on phantom scalar field cosmologies with a scalar field employing early times catalogues related to CMB measurements, along with the local standard observables, like Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), $H(z)$ measurements (Cosmic Clocks), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) baselines. In particular, we studied a tracker phantom field with hyperbolic polar coordinates that have been proposed in the literature. The main goal is to obtain precise cosmological constraints for $H\_0$ and $\sigma\_8$, in comparison to other constructions that present tension in early cosmological parameters. Our results show that phantom scalar field cosmologies have a reduced statistical tension on $H\_0$ that it is less than 3$\sigma$ using model-independent CMB catalogues as SPT-3G+WMAP9 and ACTPol DR-4+WMAP9 baselines. This suggests these models using a different phantom potential might address the Hubble constant problem and reduce the systematics involved.

2024-03-24, **Glimmers in the Cosmic Dawn: A Census of the Youngest Supermassive Black Holes by Photometric Variability**, Matthew J. Hayes et.al., [2403.16138v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16138v1)

 We report first results from a deep near infrared campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain late-epoch images of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF), 10-15 years after the first epoch data were obtained. The main objectives are to search for faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts by virtue of their photometric variability, and measure (or constrain) the comoving number density of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), n\_SMBH, at early times. In this Letter we present a brief overview of the program and preliminary results regarding eight objects. Three variables are supernovae, two of which are apparently hostless with indeterminable redshifts, although one has previously been recorded at a z\approx 6 galaxy. Two further objects are clear AGN candidates at z=2.0 and 3.2, based on morphology and/or spectroscopy, in particular infrared spectroscopy from JWST. Three variable targets are identified at z=6-7, which are also likely AGN candidates. These sources provide a first measure of n\_SMBH in the reionization epoch by photometric variability, which places a firm lower limit of 3x10^{-4} cMpc^{-3}. After accounting for variability and luminosity incompleteness, we estimate n\_SMBH \gtrsim 8x10^{-3} cMpc^{-3}, which is the largest value so far reported at these redshifts. This SMBH abundance is also strikingly similar to estimates of n\_SMBH in the local Universe. We discuss how these results test various theories for SMBH formation.

2024-03-24, **Finding Candidate TeV Halos among Very-High Energy Sources**, Dong Zheng et.al., [2403.16074v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16074v1)

 We search for possible pulsar TeV halos among the very-high-energy (VHE) sources reported in different VHE surveys, among which in particular we use the results from the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) catalog of $\gamma$-ray sources. Six candidates are found. They share the properties of containing a middle-aged, gamma-ray--bright pulsar in their positional error circles (the respective pulsars are J0248+6021, J0359+5414, J0622+3749, J0633+0632, J2006+3102, and J2238+5903), being in a rather clean field without any common Galactic VHE-emitting supernova remnants or (bright) pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), and showing the absence of any gamma-ray emissions in 0.1--500\,GeV after removing the pulsars' emissions. Combining with several (candidate) TeV halos reported, we find nearly the same relations as previously ones between their luminosities at 50\,TeV, $L\_{\rm 50TeV}$, and the corresponding pulsars' spin-down luminosities, $\dot{E}$, which are $L\_{\rm 50TeV}\sim \dot{E}^{0.9}$ and $L\_{\rm 50TeV}/\dot{E}\sim 6.4\times 10^{-4}$. We probe possible connections between the extension sizes of the VHE sources and the pulsars' ages, and find a weak trend of being older and smaller. By comparing to the VHE detection results for PWNe, it is clear to see that the (candidate) TeV halos have hard emissions by having their power-law indices smaller than 2 in 1--25\,TeV or only being detected in 25--100\,TeV. In addition, we also consider other seven VHE sources as possible TeV halos because of different study results for them, but they do not cleanly fit in the properties listed above, indicating their potential complex nature.
