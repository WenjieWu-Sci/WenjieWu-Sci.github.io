2026-01-19, **Neutrinos from hidden ultraluminous X-ray sources in the Galaxy**, Lucas M. Pasquevich et.al., [2601.13378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13378v1)

 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are point-like sources that exhibit apparent X-ray luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit for stellar-mass compact objects. A widely accepted interpretation is that these systems are X-ray binaries accreting matter possibly at super-Eddington rates. In this regime, photon trapping inflates the accretion disk, making it geometrically and optically thick. Radiation-driven winds launched from the supercritical disk form funnel-shaped walls along the symmetry axis. While the apparent X-ray luminosity can exceed the Eddington limit due to geometrical beaming within this funnel, a misalignment with the observer's line of sight strongly suppresses the X-ray emission, rendering the ULX electromagnetically obscured.   This work explores the potential for high-energy neutrino production in black hole-hosting ULXs. We model proton acceleration via magnetic reconnection in the region above the super-accreting black hole. Although electromagnetic emission is efficiently absorbed by the dense wind and radiation fields, neutrinos generated from photomeson interactions can escape. Our model self-consistently accounts for energy losses of pions and muons in this environment. The results indicate that misaligned, electromagnetically obscured Galactic ULXs could produce a neutrino flux detectable by instruments like KM3NeT and IceCube within several years of observation.

2026-01-19, **Joint analysis of small-scale galaxy clustering and galaxy--galaxy lensing from BOSS galaxies**, Wenhao Gao et.al., [2601.12976v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12976v1)

 We present a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy--galaxy lensing measurements from BOSS galaxies using a simulation-based emulation method combined with a halo occupation distribution model. Our emulators are constructed with the Aemulus $ν$ simulations, a suite of $wν$CDM $N$-body simulations with massive neutrinos as independent particle species. We combine small-scale analysis of clustering from $0.1h^{-1}$Mpc to $60.2~h^{-1}$Mpc and lensing from $1.7h^{-1}$Mpc to $60.2~h^{-1}$Mpc to perform cosmological constraints. We split the BOSS galaxies into three redshift bins to measure their clustering and employ galaxies from Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey and Hyper Suprime-Cam as source galaxies to measure lensing separately. We find that the addition of lensing significantly improves the constraining power on $S\_{8}=σ\_8(Ω\_m/0.3)^{0.5}$, with a weak improvement for $fσ\_{8}$. Our results of $fσ\_{8}$ indicate tensions of around $1\sim4σ$ below the results of CMB observations of Planck. For $S\_{8}$, our results are also lower than Planck, and the tension can be mitigated when considering possible systematics in lensing measurement. As a byproduct, our analysis prefers a non-zero neutrino mass but without strong significance, with the constraining power dominated by the clustering. Given the accuracy and precision of our model and the observational data, it is anticipated that larger and higher-quality spectroscopic datasets will improve the constraints on this fundamental property in the near future.

2026-01-19, **Pseudoscalar meson $P\to τ(\to πν_τ, ρν_τ, \ell \barν_\ell ν_τ) \barν_τ$ decays in the Standard Model and beyond**, Quan-Yi Hu et.al., [2601.12883v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12883v1)

 In this work, we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic theoretical investigation of the full cascade decays of charged pseudoscalar mesons, specifically $D\_s$, $D$, $B$, and $B\_c$, into $τν\_τ$, followed by the subsequent decay of the $τ$ via its dominant experimentally reconstructible channels: $τ\to πν\_τ$, $τ\to ρν\_τ$, $τ\to e \barν\_e ν\_τ$, and $τ\to μ\barν\_μν\_τ$. Our study is framed within the model-independent low-energy effective field theory approach, which incorporates the most general set of four-fermion operators, including those coupling to right-handed neutrinos. We provide precise Standard Model predictions for differential decay rate as a function of the final-state charged particle energy, develop an innovative and robust methodology for extracting the magnitudes of the new physics couplings using energy moments, and identify and characterize fixed points in the normalized energy distributions. The fixed points are invariant under new physics contributions described by the considered effective Hamiltonian.

2026-01-20, **MIU2Net: weak-lensing mass inversion using deep learning with nested U-structures**, Han W. G. et.al., [2601.13538v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13538v1)

 One of the primary goals of next-generation gravitational lensing surveys is to measure the large-scale distribution of dark matter, which requires accurate mass inversion to convert weak-lensing shear maps into convergence (kappa) fields. This work develops a mass inversion method tailored for upcoming space missions such as CSST and Euclid, aiming to recover both the mass distribution and the convergence power spectrum with high fidelity. We introduce MIU2Net, a versatile deep-learning framework for kappa-map reconstruction based on the U2-Net architecture. A new loss function is constructed to jointly estimate the convergence field and its frequency-domain energy distribution, effectively balancing optimal mean squared error and optimal power-spectrum recovery. The method incorporates realistic observational effects into shear fields, including shape noise, reduced shear, and complex masks. Under noise levels anticipated for future space-based lensing surveys, MIU2Net recovers the convergence power spectrum with 4% uncertainties up to l approximately 500, significantly outperforming Wiener filtering and MCALens. Beyond two-point statistics, the method accurately reconstructs the convergence distribution, peak centroid, and peak amplitude. Compared to other learning-based approaches such as DeepMass, MIU2Net reduces the root-mean-square error by 5% without smoothing and by 38% with a 1-arcmin smoothing scale. MIU2Net represents a substantial advancement in mass inversion methodology, offering improved accuracy in both RMSE and power-spectrum reconstruction. It provides a promising tool for mapping dark matter environments and large-scale structures in the era of next-generation space lensing surveys.

2026-01-19, **Mass density structuring around galaxy formation sites: impact on galaxy basic properties**, Sandra Robles et.al., [2601.13431v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13431v1)

 We study the local evolution of the Universe around galaxy formation sites in the EAGLE50 large-volume reference simulation. Using the reduced inertia tensor (r-TOI), we followed the anisotropic evolution of initially spherical Lagrangian volumes (LVs) centred at galaxy formation sites, both in dark matter (DM) and in cold baryons (CB), from very high redshift $z=15$ onward. We describe LV deformation in terms of the r-TOI eigen-directions, principal axes, their derived shape parameters, and the timescales for the freezing-out of these principal directions and axes. Of particular interest are the age of the Universe, $t\_{\rm U}$, when the local Cosmic Web (CW) spine emerges, and that when anisotropic DM mass arrangements (i.e., migrant mass flows) cease. We find that the shapes LVs acquire along their evolution affect the halo and stellar mass of their central galaxy: prolate-shaped LVs show a tendency to host low-mass galaxies at $z=0$, while massive galaxies tend to form within triaxial or oblate LVs. Also, the local CW spine tends to set in earlier on in LVs that are to host massive galaxies than in those harbouring less massive galaxies. In addition, anisotropic DM-mass rearrangements stop late on average, at $t\_{\rm U}\sim 10.5\,$Gyr, and even slightly later for CB. Interestingly, $z=0$ LVs with either flattened configurations in CB or those that are highly prolate in DM, are more likely to host rotation-dominated galaxies. This effect increases from $z=1$ to $z=0$. Finally, the CB spine of LVs that are more likely to host rotation-dominated galaxies emerges at later times.

2026-01-19, **Baryon-dark matter coincidence in Randall-Sundrum Model**, Basabendu Barman et.al., [2601.13315v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13315v1)

 Within the framework of the extra-dimensional Randall-Sundrum set-up, we investigate the freeze-in production of Standard Model (SM) gauge-singlet scalar, fermionic, and massive vector dark matter (DM). Assuming that both the DM and SM fields reside on the IR brane and interact solely through the graviton and radion, we demonstrate that the observed DM relic abundance measured by Planck can be achieved across a wide range of reheating temperatures, all while naturally addressing the hierarchy problem, satisfying constraints from collider, early Universe cosmology including $Δ{N}\_{\rm eff}$. We further show that the same set-up can accommodate TeV-scale leptogenesis capable of generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Remarkably, we find that current graviton searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) already impose strong constraints on the reheating temperature in this scenario.

2026-01-19, **Revisiting Singlet Fermion Dark Matter with a Scalar Portal: Connecting Higgs Phenomenology and Strong Electroweak Phase Transition**, Jaydeb Das et.al., [2601.13147v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13147v1)

 We investigate a minimal extension of the Standard Model with a real singlet scalar and a singlet Dirac fermion acting as dark matter. Unlike a conventional singlet scalar setup, we assume that the singlet scalar does not acquire a vacuum expectation value at zero temperature. This decouples the scalar mixing angle from the Higgs-portal quartic coupling responsible for the strong first-order electroweak phase transition, allowing it to coexist with current collider and direct-detection constraints. The Higgs-singlet mixing is generated independently through a trilinear portal interaction. We check theoretical consistency conditions, various LHC limits on heavy scalar resonances, dark matter relic abundance, and direct detection bounds to delineate the viable parameter space. We perform a state-of-the-art analysis of the electroweak phase transition, which is shown to be achieved for a few benchmark points. We further compute the resulting stochastic gravitational wave spectra and find that several scenarios yield signals potentially observable at future space-based interferometers. Our results establish a unified and testable framework that connects collider phenomenology, first-order electroweak phase transition, and the resulting production of gravitational waves, along with the dark matter phenomenology, all within a simple renormalizable extension of the Standard Model.

2026-01-19, **The long-term evolution of Ultra Faint Dwarf Galaxies and observational implications**, Francesco Flammini Dotti et.al., [2601.13049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13049v1)

 Context. In the Local Group, dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) exhibit large velocity dispersions. These values are generally attributed to the presence of substantial amounts of dark matter (DM), in line with the predictions of the standard model of galaxy formation. However, alternative, more conservative explanations exist, such as non-virialized dynamical states induced by tidal interactions, the presence of stellar streams, and artificial inflation of the velocity dispersion caused by binary-star orbital motion. Aims. We study the dynamical evolution of UFDs using purely stellar ("dry") dynamics, without invoking DM. We dynamically evolve our systems up to a Hubble time and compare our results with observational studies and previous theoretical work. Methods. We employ direct high precision NBODY simulations performed with the NBODY6++GPU code. We explore the role of binaries in inflating the velocity dispersion of low-mass host galaxies. We also present both the stellar and dynamical evolution of the stellar population, which is necessary to properly interpret our results. Results. We find that, in all our models, the UFD remains globally quasi-stationary for approximately 3000 Myr. Subsequently, the system undergoes mass segregation and experiences a phase resembling core collapse. Red giants and white dwarfs (WD) are found to play significant, but distinct, roles. Red giants provide the dominant contribution to the luminosity, whereas WDs constitute the largest fraction of the non-luminous component, accounting for approximately 13% of the total stellar population. Finally, if not taken into account properly, velocity dispersion measurements can be strongly biased by the presence of a significant binary population, which can lead to substantial overestimates of velocity dispersion in UFDs

2026-01-19, **Validation of the COSINE-100U NaI(Tl) Encapsulation for Low-Temperature Operation in Liquid Scintillator**, Kihong Park et.al., [2601.12819v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12819v1)

 The COSINE-100U (upgrade) will enhance the sensitivity of the COSINE-100 dark matter search by operating the detector array immersed in liquid scintillator (LS) at $-30^oC$. To validate the detector design for these conditions, we constructed a module using the COSINE-100U encapsulation and performed a dedicated long-term stability study. The module was first monitored at room temperature for ~110 days in air, followed by a one-week immersion in LAB-based LS to verify initial compatibility. Upon confirming stable optical performance, the temperature was lowered to $-33^oC$. During approximately 150 days of continuous operation at low temperature, we observed no degradation in performance. These results demonstrate the chemical and mechanical robustness of the encapsulation, confirming its suitability for the COSINE-100U physics run.

2026-01-20, **The R2Pub Telescopes for Surveying: An Overview and Performance Evaluation of the System**, Xuan Song et.al., [2601.13587v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13587v1)

 The R2Pub telescope, built by the Beijing Planetarium, is a 60 cm equatorial binocular telescope located at the Daocheng site of Yunnan Observatories in China, at an altitude of about 4700 m. This paper presents an overview of the R2Pub telescope system, including its design, instrumentation, and survey capabilities, and reports an initial evaluation of its system performance. R2Pub is a prime-focus binocular system, with each optical tube covering a field of view of approximately 18 square degrees. It is designed to detect a wide range of transient and variable sources in the local universe, such as variable stars, eclipsing binaries, supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, tidal disruption events, active galactic nuclei, and other unknown transients. The observatory infrastructure, including the dome, equatorial mount, optical tubes, and associated subsystems, has been fully constructed and installed, and the system has entered the commissioning phase. Benefiting from the high-altitude location, good seeing conditions, and dark sky background at the Daocheng site, performance tests during commissioning show that the R2Pub system can reach a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of about 18.7 mag in the Pan-STARRS r' band with a 60 s exposure. Ongoing observations with R2Pub are expected to contribute to studies of variable and transient phenomena and to enhance public outreach in astronomy. The binocular design enables simultaneous dual-band observations, providing instantaneous color information for transient sources and improving the classification and physical characterization of their properties and evolution.

2026-01-19, **BE Lyncis: An Extremely Eccentric Binary with the Nearest Known Black Hole**, Jia-Shu Niu et.al., [2601.12999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12999v1)

 We report the discovery of an exceptionally eccentric binary system, BE Lyncis (BE Lyn), which hosts the nearest known black hole (BH) to Earth. Through the analysis of $\textit{TESS}$ photometry combined with an extensive set of times of maximum light spanning 39 years, we identify BE Lyn as a high-amplitude $δ$ Scuti star in a binary with an orbital period of $\approx15.9$ years and an extraordinary orbital eccentricity of $e=0.9989^{+0.0008}\_{-0.0021}$ ($>0.9968$ at 95% confidence) -- the highest reliably measured for any binary system. Dynamical constraints impose an upper limit on the orbital inclination of $i \lesssim 4.0^{\circ}$, corresponding to a companion mass of $M\_2 \gtrsim 17.5~M\_{\odot}$, which unequivocally favors a black hole. This system provides a unique laboratory for studying asteroseismology in strong gravitational fields, the formation of black holes via asymmetric supernovae, and the evolution of extreme binary systems. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, the successful application of the light-travel time effect in a pulsating variable to unveil a dormant black hole, establishing a novel method for BH detection in non-interacting binaries.
