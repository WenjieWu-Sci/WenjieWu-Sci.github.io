2024-09-05, **Limits and correlations of T and Z components of CPT-odd coefficients of the Standard Model Extension at DUNE**, L. A. Delgadillo et.al., [2409.03716v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03716v1)

 We consider the possible effect of the Standard Model Extension (SME) coefficient $(a\_L)^Z$ in the neutrino propagation and discuss how this can affect DUNE limits on the coefficient $(a\_L)^T$ found elsewhere. Based on an analysis that considers both coefficients, we find new constraints for them coming from DUNE. Furthermore, we investigate the correlations of the standard oscillation parameters, the leptonic $CP-$violating phase, $\delta\_{CP}$, and the atmospheric mixing angle, $\sin^2 \theta\_{23}$, with respect to the SME coefficients $(a\_L)^T$ and $(a\_L)^Z$.

2024-09-05, **Exploring neutrino interactions in light of present and upcoming galaxy survey**, Sourav Pal et.al., [2409.03712v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03712v1)

 In the standard cosmological framework, neutrinos begin to free-stream after the weak interaction phase ends in the early universe, at a temperature of approximately $T \sim 1 \, {\rm MeV}$. However, the onset of neutrino free-streaming can be delayed if additional interactions occur in the early universe, leaving imprints on both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) angular power spectra and the large-scale structure (LSS) matter power spectra. We present a thorough analysis of early universe neutrino interactions with a fairly generalized parameterization of the interaction rates as a power law in neutrino temperature. In this (6+2) parameter scenario, we constrain the cosmological parameters along with the free-streaming redshift and the sum of the neutrino mass in presence of such interactions, with the help of full shape (FS) galaxy power spectra from BOSS Data Release 12. Our analysis reveals that a combined dataset of FS along with CMB and BAO offers improved constraints on the free-streaming redshift from present data, comparable to the forecast results from future CMB-S4 data. Additionally, we investigate the prospects of future galaxy surveys by forecasting on Euclid mission in combination with Planck and CMB-S4, and find significant improvement on both the free-streaming redshift and the sum of the neutrino mass than the existing constraints as well as than CMB-S4 alone.

2024-09-05, **Enhancing Sensitivity in Ge-Based Rare-Event Physics Experiments through Underground Crystal Growth and Detector Fabrication**, Dongming Mei et.al., [2409.03580v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03580v1)

 The cosmogenic production of long-lived isotopes such as $^{3}$H,$^{55}$Fe, $^{60}$Co, $^{65}$Zn, and $^{68}$Ge poses a significant challenge as a source of background events in Ge-based dark matter (DM) and neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) experiments. In the pursuit of DM, particularly within the largely unexplored parameter space for low-mass DM, new detector technologies are being developed with extremely low-energy thresholds to detect MeV-scale DM. However, isotopes like $^{3}$H, $^{55}$Fe, $^{65}$Zn, and $^{68}$Ge, produced cosmogenically within the detector material, emerge as dominant backgrounds that severely limit sensitivity in these searches. Similarly, efforts to detect $0\nu\beta\beta$, especially under a neutrino normal mass hierarchy scenario, require a sensitivity to the effective Majorana mass of $\sim$1 meV. Achieving this level of sensitivity necessitates stringent suppression of background signals from isotopes such as $^{60}$Co and $^{68}$Ge, which impose critical detection limits. To reach the targeted sensitivity for these next-generation experiments and to unlock their full discovery potential for both low-mass DM and $0\nu\beta\beta$, relocating Ge crystal growth and detector fabrication to underground environments is crucial. This approach is the most effective strategy to significantly reduce the production of these long-lived isotopes, thereby ensuring the experimental sensitivity required for groundbreaking discoveries.

2024-09-05, **Euclid preparation. Simulations and nonlinearities beyond $Λ$CDM. 2. Results from non-standard simulations**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2409.03523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03523v1)

 The Euclid mission will measure cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision. To distinguish between cosmological models, it is essential to generate realistic mock observables from cosmological simulations that were run in both the standard $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm and in many non-standard models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We present the scientific results from a suite of cosmological N-body simulations using non-standard models including dynamical dark energy, k-essence, interacting dark energy, modified gravity, massive neutrinos, and primordial non-Gaussianities. We investigate how these models affect the large-scale-structure formation and evolution in addition to providing synthetic observables that can be used to test and constrain these models with Euclid data. We developed a custom pipeline based on the Rockstar halo finder and the nbodykit large-scale structure toolkit to analyse the particle output of non-standard simulations and generate mock observables such as halo and void catalogues, mass density fields, and power spectra in a consistent way. We compare these observables with those from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and quantify the deviations. We find that non-standard cosmological models can leave significant imprints on the synthetic observables that we have generated. Our results demonstrate that non-standard cosmological N-body simulations provide valuable insights into the physics of dark energy and dark matter, which is essential to maximising the scientific return of Euclid.

2024-09-05, **Euclid preparation. Simulations and nonlinearities beyond $Λ$CDM. 4. Constraints on $f(R)$ models from the photometric primary probes**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2409.03524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03524v1)

 We study the constraint on $f(R)$ gravity that can be obtained by photometric primary probes of the Euclid mission. Our focus is the dependence of the constraint on the theoretical modelling of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. In the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, we consider four different predictions for the ratio between the power spectrum in $f(R)$ and that in $\Lambda$CDM: a fitting formula, the halo model reaction approach, ReACT and two emulators based on dark matter only $N$-body simulations, FORGE and e-Mantis. These predictions are added to the MontePython implementation to predict the angular power spectra for weak lensing (WL), photometric galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation. By running Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we compare constraints on parameters and investigate the bias of the recovered $f(R)$ parameter if the data are created by a different model. For the pessimistic setting of WL, one dimensional bias for the $f(R)$ parameter, $\log\_{10}\|f\_{R0}\|$, is found to be $0.5 \sigma$ when FORGE is used to create the synthetic data with $\log\_{10}\|f\_{R0}\| =-5.301$ and fitted by e-Mantis. The impact of baryonic physics on WL is studied by using a baryonification emulator BCemu. For the optimistic setting, the $f(R)$ parameter and two main baryon parameters are well constrained despite the degeneracies among these parameters. However, the difference in the nonlinear dark matter prediction can be compensated by the adjustment of baryon parameters, and the one-dimensional marginalised constraint on $\log\_{10}\|f\_{R0}\|$ is biased. This bias can be avoided in the pessimistic setting at the expense of weaker constraints. For the pessimistic setting, using the $\Lambda$CDM synthetic data for WL, we obtain the prior-independent upper limit of $\log\_{10}\|f\_{R0}\|< -5.6$. Finally, we implement a method to include theoretical errors to avoid the bias.

2024-09-05, **Euclid preparation. Simulations and nonlinearities beyond $Λ$CDM. 1. Numerical methods and validation**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2409.03522v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03522v1)

 To constrain models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, the development of the Euclid analysis pipeline requires simulations that capture the nonlinear phenomenology of such models. We present an overview of numerical methods and $N$-body simulation codes developed to study the nonlinear regime of structure formation in alternative dark energy and modified gravity theories. We review a variety of numerical techniques and approximations employed in cosmological $N$-body simulations to model the complex phenomenology of scenarios beyond $\Lambda$CDM. This includes discussions on solving nonlinear field equations, accounting for fifth forces, and implementing screening mechanisms. Furthermore, we conduct a code comparison exercise to assess the reliability and convergence of different simulation codes across a range of models. Our analysis demonstrates a high degree of agreement among the outputs of different simulation codes, providing confidence in current numerical methods for modelling cosmic structure formation beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We highlight recent advances made in simulating the nonlinear scales of structure formation, which are essential for leveraging the full scientific potential of the forthcoming observational data from the Euclid mission.

2024-09-05, **On-orbit calibration and long-term performance of the DAMPE trigger system**, Wen-Hao Li et.al., [2409.03352v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03352v1)

 The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a satellite-borne particle detector for measurements of high-energy cosmic rays and {\gamma}-rays. DAMPE has been operating smoothly in space for more than 8 years since launch on December 17, 2015. The trigger logic of DAMPE is designed according to the deposited energy information recorded by the calorimeter. The precise calibration of the trigger thresholds and their long-term evolutions are very important for the scientific analysis of DAMPE. In this work, we develop a new method for the threshold calibration, considering the influence from the electronic noise, and obtain the long-term evolutions of the trigger thresholds. The average increase rate of the trigger thresholds for the first 4 layers of the calorimeter is found to be about 0.9% per year, resulting in variations of the high-energy trigger efficiency of cosmic ray electrons by about -5% per year at 2 GeV and less than about -0.05% above 30 GeV.

2024-09-05, **YOLO-CL cluster detection in the Rubin/LSST DC2 simulation**, Kirill Grishin et.al., [2409.03333v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03333v1)

 LSST will provide galaxy cluster catalogs up to z$\sim$1 that can be used to constrain cosmological models once their selection function is well-understood. We have applied the deep convolutional network YOLO for CLuster detection (YOLO-CL) to LSST simulations from the Dark Energy Science Collaboration Data Challenge 2 (DC2), and characterized the LSST YOLO-CL cluster selection function. We have trained and validated the network on images from a hybrid sample of (1) clusters observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and detected with the red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation, and (2) simulated DC2 dark matter haloes with masses $M\_{200c} > 10^{14} M\_{\odot}$. We quantify the completeness and purity of the YOLO-CL cluster catalog with respect to DC2 haloes with $M\_{200c} > 10^{14} M\_{\odot}$. The YOLO-CL cluster catalog is 100% and 94% complete for halo mass $M\_{200c} > 10^{14.6} M\_{\odot}$ at $0.2<z<0.8$, and $M\_{200c} > 10^{14} M\_{\odot}$ and redshift $z \lesssim 1$, respectively, with only 6% false positive detections. All the false positive detections are dark matter haloes with $ 10^{13.4} M\_{\odot} \lesssim M\_{200c} \lesssim 10^{14} M\_{\odot}$. The YOLO-CL selection function is almost flat with respect to the halo mass at $0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.9$. The overall performance of YOLO-CL is comparable or better than other cluster detection methods used for current and future optical and infrared surveys. YOLO-CL shows better completeness for low mass clusters when compared to current detections in surveys using the Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect, and detects clusters at higher redshifts than X-ray-based catalogs. The strong advantage of YOLO-CL over traditional galaxy cluster detection techniques is that it works directly on images and does not require photometric and photometric redshift catalogs, nor does it need to mask stellar sources and artifacts.

# supernova (1)

2024-09-05, **Diversity in hydrogen-rich envelope mass of type II supernovae (II): SN 2023ixf as explosion of partially-stripped intermediate massive star**, Qiliang Fang et.al., [2409.03540v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03540v1)

 SN 2023ixf is one of the most well-observed core-collapse supernova in recent decades, yet there is inconsistency in the inferred zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) mass $M\_{\rm ZAMS}$ of its progenitor. Direct observations of the pre-SN red supergiant (RSG) estimate $M\_{\rm ZAMS}$ spanning widely from 11 to 18 $M\_{\rm \odot}$. Additional constraints, including host environment and the pulsation of its progenitor RSG, suggest a massive progenitor with $M\_{\rm ZAMS}$ > 17 $M\_{\rm \odot}$. However, the analysis of the properties of supernova, from light curve modeling to late phase spectroscopy, favor a relatively low mass scenario ($M\_{\rm ZAMS}$ < 15 $M\_{\rm \odot}$). In this work, we conduct systematic analysis of SN 2023ixf, from the RSG progenitor, plateau phase light curve to late phase spectroscopy. Using MESA+STELLA to simulate the RSG progenitor and their explosions, we find that, despite the ZAMS mass of the RSG models being varied from 12.0 to 17.5 $M\_{\rm \odot}$, they can produce light curves that well match with SN 2023ixf if the envelope mass and the explosion energy are allowed to vary. Using late phase spectroscopy as independent measurement, the oxygen emission line [O I] suggests the ZAMS is intermediate massive (~16.0 $M\_{\rm \odot}$), and the relatively weak H$\alpha$ emission line indicates the hydrogen envelope has been partially removed before the explosion. By incorporating the velocity structure derived from the light curve modeling into an axisymmetric model, we successfully generated [O I] line profiles that are consistent with the [O I] line observed in late phase spectroscopy of SN 2023ixf. Bringing these analyses together, we conclude that SN 2023ixf is the aspherical explosion of an intermediate massive star ($M\_{\rm ZAMS}$ = 15-16 $M\_{\rm \odot}$) with the hydrogen envelope being partially stripped to 4-5 $M\_{\rm \odot}$ prior to its explosion.
