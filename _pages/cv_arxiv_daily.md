2025-11-24, **Refractive neutrino masses in the solar DM halo: Can the dark-LMA solution be revived?**, Susobhan Chattopadhyay et.al., [2511.19420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19420v1)

 Neutrinos can acquire "refractive masses" as a consequence of their interactions with ultralight dark matter (DM). We explore a model with two additional sterile neutrinos and an ultralight scalar field which acts as DM and interacts with all five neutrinos. We show that the effective $5 \times 5$ Hamiltonian for neutrino propagation can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix $\mathbb{P}$ parametrized by 6 mixing angles and 1 complex phase. When active-sterile mixing angles are small, we identify a parametrization for $\mathbb{P}$ that reduces neutrino propagation inside the Sun to a two-flavor problem for a uniform DM background. In the presence of a DM halo inside the Sun, however, the propagation shows additional features in the region of halo dominance. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the electron neutrino survival probability in the presence of the DM halo. We show that this probability has a strong dependence on the neutrino production region even for a fixed energy, and numerically calculate the effects of averaging over these production regions. Comparisons with the re-interpreted solar data, in the light of possible active-sterile neutrino conversions, would allow putting bounds on the halo parameters. Finally, we examine the possibility of reviving the dark-LMA solution in this context, where the survival probability spectrum can have attractive features aligned with the measurements at Super-Kamiokande.

 We update the analysis of the viability of the lepton mixing patterns originating from $A\_4$, $S\_4$ and $A\_5$ discrete flavour symmetries and leading to predictions for the solar neutrino mixing angle, $θ\_{12}$. We perform a statistical analysis using as an input (i) the results of the latest global fit to neutrino oscillation data, and (ii) the first JUNO measurement of $\sin^2θ\_{12}$. Out of the five (four) cases compatible with the global data at $3σ$ for normal (inverted) neutrino mass ordering, only three (two) cases remain compatible with the global data at the same confidence level after taking into account the JUNO result.

2025-11-24, **Gravitational Wave Probe of Singlet-Doublet Dark Matter Induced Radiative Neutrino Mass**, Ujjal Kumar Dey et.al., [2511.19386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19386v1)

 We investigate an one loop radiative neutrino mass model, where the loop particles, notably a singlet fermion ($χ$), a doublet fermion ($Ψ$) and three generations of singlet scalars ($φ\_i, i=\{1,2,3\}$) are assumed to be odd under an additional $\mathcal{Z}\_2$-symmetry. In this setup, the singlet fermion mixes with the neutral component of the doublet to give rise singlet-doublet Majorana dark matter. The addition of $\mathcal{Z}\_2$ odd scalars in the model provides rich phenomenological implications. We find that the quartic interaction terms between the SM Higgs and $φ\_i$s play a significant role in modifying the scalar potential to have a first-order phase transition (FOPT) leading to observable gravitational waves (GWs) spectra. We also examine the non-trivial role played by the singlet-doublet fermion DM and the scalars in loop-induced neutrino mass, $(g-2)\_μ$, and lepton flavor violation. We find that the model is predictive due to the combined constraints and can be verified at different terrestrial experiments.

2025-11-24, **Limits on GeV-scale WIMP Annihilation in Dwarf Spheroidals with IceCube DeepCore**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2511.19385v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19385v1)

 Dark matter is approximately five times more abundant than baryonic matter in the universe, but its physical nature continues to elude physicists. One potential candidate for dark matter is a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), which is predicted by various extensions to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. After becoming gravitationally bound in cosmic structures, WIMPs can self-annihilate and produce SM particles including neutrinos, which are observable by detectors like IceCube. We present a search for neutrinos from low-mass $(\leq 300 \, \mathrm{GeV})$ WIMP annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with over seven years of IceCube livetime. We find no statistically significant evidence of neutrinos produced by WIMP annihilation, and therefore set upper limits on the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section $\left<σv\right>$. Our strongest upper limits at the 90\% confidence level are $\mathcal{O}\!\left(10^{-22} \, \mathrm{{cm}^{3} \, s^{-1}}\right)$ for WIMP annihilation directly into neutrino-antineutrino pairs. For our least sensitive channel, the corresponding limits are $\mathcal{O}\!\left(10^{-20} \, \mathrm{{cm}^{3} \, s^{-1}}\right)$, which is an improvement of over two orders of magnitude over previous IceCube limits from dwarf galaxies at the upper end of our mass range.

2025-11-24, **Scalarful double beta decay**, Jordy de Vries et.al., [2511.19173v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19173v1)

 We revisit scalar emissions in double beta decays of nuclei, often discussed in the context of Majoron models, in light of the latest developments on the study of neutrinoless double beta decay amplitudes from an effective field theory approach. The sensitivity of double beta decay experiments to this process is assessed through an analysis of spectral shapes, and the study is extended to massive scalars, scalars coupling to sterile neutrinos, and exotic right-handed effective couplings.

2025-11-24, **Cryogenic characterization of FBK NUV-HD-Cryo 3T SiPM sensors for the DUNE photon detection system**, F. Acerbi et.al., [2511.19095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19095v1)

 The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino experiment based in the USA and composed of a Near Detector (ND) complex at Fermi National Laboratory (FNAL), and a Far Detector (FD) complex located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) $\sim$1300\,km distant. DUNE will study neutrino oscillations looking for unresolved issues of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) such as CP violation in the leptonic sector, neutrino mass ordering and others, starting from the early 2030s. The FD, with a mass of $\sim$17\,kt, that will exploit both ionization and scintillation signals to detect neutrino interactions with Argon. Scintillating photons in LAr will be detected by the photon detection system (PDS) based on light collectors coupled to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). During a test campaign, different laboratories of the collaboration performed an investigation of the best SiPM candidates that fulfill the DUNE FD requirements. We identified two models of SiPM, produced by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (HPK) and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), respectively. In this paper, we focus on the FBK selected model showing its main features. We will describe the characterization protocol, the results at both room and cryogenic temperatures and the photon detection efficiency measurements.

2025-11-24, **Enhancing low energy reconstruction and classification in KM3NeT/ORCA with transformers**, Iván Mozún Mateo et.al., [2511.18999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18999v1)

 The current KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescope, still under construction, has not yet reached its full potential in neutrino reconstruction capability. When training any deep learning model, no explicit information about the physics or the detector is provided, thus they remain unknown to the model. This study leverages the strengths of transformers by incorporating attention masks inspired by the physics and detector design, making the model understand both the telescope design and the neutrino physics measured on it. The study also shows the efficacy of transformers on retaining valuable information between detectors when doing fine-tuning from one configurations to another.

2025-11-24, **The variability of blazars throughout the electromagnetic spectrum**, Claudia M. Raiteri et.al., [2511.18975v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18975v1)

 With their jet pointing towards us, blazars are ideal tools to study the physics and structure of extragalactic jets. Their powerful jets are cosmic particle accelerators and are alleged to be one of the production sites of the high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory. Doppler beaming of the jet nonthermal radiation increases blazar brightness, blue-shifts their emission, and shortens their variability time scales, which are observed to range from years down to minutes. This review will focus on blazar flux, spectral, and polarization variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Interpretation of blazar variability calls into question both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Shock waves, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence can accelerate particles inside the jet, while jet precession, rotation, and twisting can produce variations in Doppler beaming. Microvariability puts strong constraints on the size of the emitting regions, suggesting a multizone emitting jet. Twisting jets have been proposed to explain the long-term multiwavelength variability. They are supported by radio observations of bent or helical jets, and by results of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of plasma jets. Detection of (quasi)periodic behaviour has been ascribed to orbital motion in black hole binary systems, jet precession, kink instabilities developing inside the jet, or perturbations in the accretion disc. Gravitational microlensing has been suggested to explain blazar behaviour in some cases. Polarization provides information on the structure and behaviour of the magnetic field in the emission zones. Both the degree and angle of polarization can show strong and fast variability, which is sometimes correlated with flux. The interpretation of flux, spectral, and polarization variability within a consistent picture challenges current models of blazar variability.

2025-11-24, **GPS-Synchronized Monitoring of Supernova Bursts in PandaX-4T: Enabling a Neutrino Trigger for Multi-Messenger Astronomy**, Binyu Pang et.al., [2511.18916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18916v1)

 The landmark detection of neutrinos from SN 1987A marked the dawn of a new era in astrophysics, unequivocally establishing them as indispensable probes for investigating stellar evolution and supernova dynamics. Today, supernova burst neutrinos can be observed through coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering in tonne-scale liquid xenon detectors designed for direct dark matter detection. Capitalizing on this capability, we have developed and deployed a real-time supernova monitoring system for the PandaX-4T experiment. This system incorporates a GPS module providing millisecond-level timing precision, achieves a low false-alarm rate, and maintains high sensitivity to galactic supernova events. This robust methodology is directly scalable and slated for implementation in the next-generation PandaX-20T experiment.

2025-11-24, **Measurement of Milli-Charged Particles with a running electromagnetic coupling constant at IceCube**, Ye Xu et.al., [2511.18881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18881v1)

 It is assumed that heavy dark matter $φ$ with O(TeV) mass captured by the Earth may decay to relativistic light milli-charged particles (MCPs). These MCPs could be measured by the IceCube neutrino telescope. The massless hidden photon model was taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei with a running electromagnetic coupling constant, so that the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs may be evaluated at IceCube. Meanwhile, the numbers of expected neutrino background events were also evaluated at IceCube. Based on the assumption that no events are observed at IceCube in 10 years, the corresponding upper limits on MCP fluxes were calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicated that the MCPs from the Earth's core could be directly detected at O(1TeV) energies at IceCube when $5.65\times10^{-5}\lesssimε^2\lesssim1.295\times10^{-3}$. And a new region of 4 GeV < $m\_{MCP}$ < 100 GeV and $5.51\times10^{-2}$ < $ε$ < 0.612 is ruled out in the $m\_{MCP}$-$ε$ plane with 10 years of IceCube data.

2025-11-24, **Development of a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber prototype for the RELICS experiment**, Lingfeng Xie et.al., [2511.18693v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18693v1)

 The RELICS (REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent elastic Scattering) experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from reactor antineutrinos using a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. To validate the detector concept and ensure technical reliability for the full-scale experiment, a dedicated prototype was designed, constructed, and operated. This work presents an overview of the design, construction, and operational performance of the prototype, with emphasis on its major subsystems, including the TPC, cryogenic and xenon purification systems, slow control, and data acquisition. During operation, the detector demonstrated the capability to achieve a sub-keV energy threshold required for the RELICS physics program, as reflected by a measured single electron gain of 34.30~$\pm$~0.01~(stat.)~PE/e$^-$ and the successful detection of 0.27~keV L-shell decay events from $^{37}$Ar. In addition, essential data analysis techniques and simulation frameworks were developed and validated, establishing the methodological foundation for future RELICS operations. The successful construction and operation of this prototype confirm the feasibility of the core technologies and provide a crucial experimental basis for the final RELICS detector.

2025-11-23, **Performance of the High-Angle Time Projection Chambers in the Upgraded T2K Off-Axis Near Detector**, K. Aivazelis et.al., [2511.18650v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18650v1)

 The off-axis magnetic near detector of the T2K experiment has undergone a significant upgrade, including the construction and installation of two new Time Projection Chambers featuring innovative resistive Micromegas technology and a field cage composed of thin composite walls. This paper provides a detailed description of the new components of the chambers, including the gas system, gas monitoring chambers, and data acquisition system. Additionally, it reports the results of extensive testing using both neutrino beams and cosmic rays, with comparisons between data and Monte Carlo simulations. The new detectors achieve improved spatial resolution and enhanced particle identification capabilities which are crucial for the precision goals of the T2K experiment.

2025-11-23, **r-Process nucleosynthesis from hyperaccreting neutron stars in common envelopes**, Peter Anninos et.al., [2511.18584v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18584v1)

 We investigate nuclear reactions and feedback in hyperaccreting neutron star environments, considering accretion rates in the range 0.3 - $3\times10^4$ $M\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, typical of short-period compact object binaries in common envelopes. Our mode ls account for weak reactions, neutrino energy loss, nuclear energy release, pair production, degenerate equations of state, and general relativistic hydrodynamics. Depending on accretion rates, these systems can develop both proton and neutron-rich atmospheres with strong convective instabilities linking the neutrino sphere to the outgoing accretion shock inside the radia tion trapping zone. Convection drives nucleons through multiple heating and cooling cycles, with photodisintegration dominat ing during the heating phase and heavy element synthesis during the cooling phase, ejecting material with abundances that dep end on the accretion rate and depth of the final decompression trajectory. The turbulent nature of convective currents is con ducive to creating a wide range of nuclear products through a variety of effects, including NSE freezeout and $r$, $p$ and $\ gamma$ processes. We also observe a novel multi-step process in reheated trajectories, consisting of proton-capture and photo-dissociation reactions operating on $r$-process seeds, producing overall neutron-deficient isotopes. A significant amount of infalling gas experiences high entropy and short (millisecond) freezeout timescales capable of making $r$-process elements w ith high over-abundances through a disequilibrium effect between neutrons and $α$-particles that does not require an excess of neutrons.

2025-11-23, **Optimizing the potential of KM3NeT in detecting core-collapse supernovae**, KM3NeT Collaboration et.al., [2511.18565v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18565v1)

 Core-collapse supernovae mark the end of life of massive stars. However, despite their importance in astrophysics, their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neutrinos that emerge from the dense core of the star offer a promising way to study supernova dynamics. A strategy is presented to improve the potential of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope to detect core-collapse supernovae in our Galaxy or the Large Magellanic Cloud by further exploiting the properties of its optical modules equipped with multiple photomultipliers. A supernova burst is expected to produce a sudden hit rate increase in the KM3NeT detectors. New observables have been defined for individual optical modules that exploit the geometry and time distribution of the detected hits, enabling a better discrimination between signal and background signatures. In addition, a thorough investigation of the related systematic uncertainties is presented for the first time. When implemented, this new methodology allowed KM3NeT to probe 46% more Galactic core-collapse supernova candidates than with the previous trigger strategy, reaching the dense Galactic bulge. It is now expected that, once completed, KM3NeT will achieve full Galactic sensitivity to core-collapse supernovae.

2025-11-23, **Detection prospects for the Cosmic Neutrino Background using matter interferometers**, Chrisna Setyo Nugroho et.al., [2511.18245v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18245v1)

 In this paper we discuss how the Cosmic Neutrino Background can affect the measured phase difference in a matter interferometer. This phase is proportional to a difference in potential energies along the two interferometer paths. The relevant potentials here are the well-known neutrino matter potential and a potential related to the Stodolsky effect. We show how they can be rewritten in terms of scalar potentials, pseudo magnetic fields and spin-spin interactions. Unfortunately, current technology is unlikely to detect this effect and we discuss prospects for the future. We also briefly comment on fermionic Dark Matter which can give rise to very similar effects which can easily be larger than the neutrino case.

 Cosmological N-body simulations have long suggested that the pseudo phase-space density (PPSD), $ρ/σ^3$, of cold dark matter halos follows the universal relation $ρ/σ^3 \propto r^χ$, with $χ\approx -1.875$, as predicted by spherical secondary-infall similarity solutions. This power law appears to hold despite the fact that neither the density $ρ(r)$ nor velocity dispersion $σ(r)$ follow universal power law relations individually, even at fixed mass. We analyze 246 host halos from the Symphony suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations, to consistently measure PPSD profiles across host masses from $10^{11}$ to $10^{15} M\_\odot$. We find that the PPSD systematically deviates from a power law, and that halos with larger deviations from Jeans equilibrium systematically develop steeper average PPSD slopes. This result suggests that the PPSD is not universal; instead, it is linked to a halo's degree of dynamical equilibrium, which is ultimately set by halo formation history. As a result, we show that secondary halo properties such as concentration and accretion rate inherit significant correlations with the PPSD slope. Moreover, our hosts' PPSD profiles are remarkably consistent with predictions from 1D self-similar fluid collapse models, indicating that three-dimensional structure, velocity anisotropy, and cosmological environment all play negligible roles in shaping the PPSD. These findings imply that the PPSD does not follow a universal power law, but is instead determined by halo mass assembly history alone.

2025-11-24, **Improved constraints on ultralight axions using latest observations of the early and late Universe**, Qianshuo Liu et.al., [2511.18917v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18917v1)

 Ultralight axions (ULAs) are hypothetical particles which can behave like dark matter (DM) or dark energy (DE) depending on masses generated at the symmetry-breaking scale. It remains a mystery whether the ULAs can make up a fraction of DM or DE. Although theoretical predictions indicate that the ULAs may leave distinct imprints on cosmological signals, these signatures may exist in a broad spatial and temporal scales, and may be degenerate with the known effects of the standard model. The ULA signatures are extremely subtle and the observational evidence of the ULAs remain elusive. In this work, we infer the ULA properties using both the early and late universe observations from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We validate modeling of the ULA effects using the CMB and BAO mock data and perform different tests to cross-check the results. By analyzing the Planck 2018 CMB measurements and the BAO measurements from the Data Release 2 of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we constrain the energy density fraction ratio of the ULAs to total dark matter $Ω\_a/Ω\_d$ and obtain a new upper bound of $Ω\_a/Ω\_d$. Future CMB and BAO measurements will achieve unprecedented precision and will be crucial for understanding the nature of the ULAs.

2025-11-24, **Dark Matter Induced Nucleon Decay Through the Neutron Portal**, Nicole F. Bell et.al., [2511.18722v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18722v1)

 The neutron portal operator provides a theoretically motivated connection between the visible and dark sectors and features in several well-studied asymmetric dark matter models. This operator leads to dark matter induced nucleon decays that mimic the experimental signature of "ordinary" nucleon decays. In this work, we reinterpret Super-Kamiokande nucleon decay searches for $n \rightarrow π^0 ν$ and $p \rightarrow π^+ ν$ to constrain dark matter induced nucleon decays. For GeV-scale dark matter, we obtain lower bounds of $\mathcal{O}(1~\rm{TeV})$ on the scale of the effective neutron portal operator. We also discuss the prospects for future searches at Hyper-Kamiokande and highlight the importance of a dedicated experimental analysis with reduced systematic uncertainties.

2025-11-23, **Milky Way galaxy-analogs and isolated galaxies with bars: environmental density in the Local Volume**, O. V. Kompaniiets et.al., [2511.18612v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18612v1)

 The environmental density of galaxies within the cosmic web constrains their 3D locations in filaments, voids, groups, and clusters. It traces the distribution of baryons and the influence of dark-matter halos on galaxy evolution, and helps diagnose external processes such as supernova and AGN feedback, tidal interactions, ram-pressure stripping, and large-scale flows. We focus on isolated barred galaxies, the parent population that includes Milky Way analogs. To measure local environmental density and verify isolation (\|Delta v\| <= 500 km s^-1), we built a Python pipeline that works in two redshift regimes: low (z0 < 0.02) and high (z0 >= 0.02). Densities were estimated with k-nearest neighbors and Voronoi tessellations and classified as void (Sigma < 0.05), filament (0.05 <= Sigma < 0.5), group (0.5 <= Sigma < 2.0), and cluster (Sigma >= 2.0). Our northern-sky sample contains 311 isolated barred galaxies from 2MIG plus Milky Way analog systems (z < 0.07). We find 157 void, 84 filament, 27 group, and 11 cluster galaxies; 30 have no detected neighbors. Sixty-seven lie in extremely low-density regions (Sigma\_3D < 0.01 gal Mpc^-3), and 22 have the nearest companion beyond 5 Mpc, indicating residence in extended voids. The Milky Way (Sigma\_5NN ~ 0.13 gal Mpc^-3, R ~ 2.1 Mpc) and its close analog NGC 3521 both lie in filamentary environments at the edge of a nearby void. For z > 0.02 we identify three additional Milky Way analog candidates from the density metrics: CGCG 208-043 (3D Voronoi) and NGC 5231 and CGCG 047-026 (5th-nearest neighbor). These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.

2025-11-23, **Kinematic Mapping of Giant Arcs: A New Method to Locate Lensing Critical Curves**, Ruwen Zhou et.al., [2511.18479v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18479v1)

 Proximity of lensing critical curves features highly magnified portions of lensed galaxies. Accurate knowledge of the location and shape of the critical curve will be useful for understanding the nature of highly magnified stellar sources near critical curves and for revealing sub-galactic dark matter structures within the lens. In galaxy-cluster lenses, however, prediction of critical curves can be uncertain due to complexity in global mass modeling. Bracketing the critical curve with sparse lensed image pairs of compact continuum sources may not be sufficient as additional information available throughout the extended arc is not used. We explore and validate a kinematics-based method for locating the critical curve. This method leverages the continuous line-of-sight velocity profile of the lensed galaxy mapped through integral field spectroscopy of nebular emission lines, and combines an agnostic local lens model and a disk rotation model. Applying our method to a highly magnified region of the Dragon Arc in the Abell 370 cluster lensing field using archival VLT/MUSE IFU mapping of the H$β$ line, we constrain the critical curve to an uncertainty band with a half-width of 0.23" ($1σ$). This reveals locations of recently detected extremely magnified stars biased toward the negative-parity side of the critical curve, as predicted for intracluster microlensing. With future JWST/NIRSpec IFU mapping of the H$α$ line at SNR $\simeq$ 10 (20), uncertainty may improve to 0.12" (0.08"). A measurement of this type with sufficiently small uncertainty may reveal small-scale wiggles in the shape of the critical curve where it crosses the giant arc, which can arise from the lensing perturbation of sub-galactic dark matter substructure. Our approach is generally applicable to caustic-crossing giant arcs in extragalactic lensing fields and can be incorporated into global lens modeling.

2025-11-24, **Revisiting model-independent constraints on spatial curvature and cosmic ladders calibration: updated and forecast analyses**, Arianna Favale et.al., [2511.19332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19332v1)

 Model-independent approaches have gained increasing attention as powerful tools to investigate persistent tensions between cosmological observations and the predictions of $Λ$CDM. Notably, recent DESY5 Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data challenge the validity of the cosmological constant, and they remain in tension with SH0ES local distance ladder measurements under standard pre-recombination physics. Building on our previous work, MNRAS 523 (2023) 3, 3406-3422, we present a follow-up analysis of the model-independent calibration of the local and inverse distance ladders using cosmic chronometers (CCH) data and Gaussian Processes. We jointly constrain the SNIa absolute magnitude, $M$, the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, $r\_d$, and the spatial curvature parameter, $Ω\_k$, using CCH with DESY5 and DESI DR1/DR2. We find this data combination compatible with a flat universe at $\sim1.7σ$, with $Ω\_k=-0.143\pm0.085$, showing weaker compatibility than with Pantheon+, while the ladder calibrators read $M=-19.324\_{-0.095}^{+0.092}$ and $r\_d=(144.00^{+5.38}\_{-4.88}$) Mpc. Although current uncertainties limit the precision of our constraints and prevent us from arbitrating the Hubble tension, it is nevertheless instructive to explore the constraining power of our methodology with future SNIa, CCH, and BAO from surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and DESI. We present the first forecast analysis for the triad $(M,Ω\_k,r\_d)$, finding that, in an optimistic scenario, upcoming data will improve agnostic constraints on $M$ by $\sim$54% and on $r\_d$ by $\sim$66%, enabling a $\sim2$% determination of $H\_0$. Precision on $Ω\_k$ will increase by $\sim50$%. Our analysis outlines which improvements in future data - whether in quality, quantity, or redshift coverage - are likely to most effectively tighten these constraints.[abridged]

2025-11-24, **Lost and Found - A gallery of overlooked optical nuclear transients from the ZTF archive**, E. Quintin et.al., [2511.19016v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19016v1)

 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) correspond to the destruction of a star by the tidal forces around a black hole, leading to outbursts which can last from months to years. These transients are rare, and increasing the current sample is paramount to understand them. As part of the Fink alert broker, we have developed an early detection system for TDEs for the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data. In this paper, we report on the optical transients we found either during the development of this tool, or when applying the classifier to the existing archive. We use this sample to anticipate what improvements to the TDE detection systems will need to be implemented for future surveys. For all the transients, we present optical and infrared archival photometry from ZTF, WISE, and Catalina, and assess the previous nuclear activity of the host. We fit the ZTF lightcurves with both a phenomenological and a physically-motivated model. We report on a total of 19 optical nuclear transients, out of which nine are in passive galaxies, eight in active galaxies, and two for which the activity of the host is uncertain. Two transients are newly discovered repeated TDE candidates, and we compare them to the current sample of repeated optical nuclear transients. One transient is exceptionally long-lived (over 5 years), in an until-now passive galaxy. Three of the TDE-like flares in active galaxies have absolute g-band magnitudes brighter than -24, making them new Extreme Nuclear Transient (ENT) candidates. One seemingly repeated object was revealed to be two independent supernovae in the same galaxy. This sample shows both the potential of our detection system for future discovery, and the relevance of archival searches to reveal overlooked transients. It also raises several points of concern and avenues of improvement for current and future classifiers.

2025-11-24, **Schrödinger-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity-nonmetricity driven cosmological evolution from inflation to the late Universe**, Lei Ming et.al., [2511.18866v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18866v1)

 We consider an $f(Q, T)$ gravity theory with a Schrödinger type vectorial non-metricity. In the presence of such a non-metricity, the length of vectors is preserved under autoparallel transport. We obtain the field equations assuming a vanishing total scalar curvature, implemented by a Lagrange multiplier, and investigate their cosmological implications. To do this, we derive the generalized Friedmann equations which now have terms involving the non-metricity and the Lagrange multiplier. Then, we consider two distinct cosmological applications of the model. First of all, by adopting distinct forms of these two basic variables and investigate the possibility of the existence of warm inflationary scenarios within the framework of these models. In particular, we consider the case that the non-metricity is described by a constant vector, and we show that with this assumption we recover standard general relativity. The scenario in which the Lagrange multiplier is a constant is also investigated, and we show that radiation can be created during the very early phases of expansion. The amount of radiation peaks at a certain time after which, there is a transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one. Moreover, we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the considered Schrödinger type cosmology with a set of observational data for the Hubble function, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, by adopting a simple linear form for the Lagrange density. The model predictions are also compared with the results of the $Λ$CDM standard paradigm. Our results indicate that the Schrödinger $f(Q,T)$ type theory can give a good description of the observational data for both the very early and the late Universe.

 The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in both young and old stellar populations suggests multiple formation pathways, beyond just young magnetars from core-collapse supernovae. A promising delayed channel involves the formation of FRB-emitting neutron stars through merger- or accretion-induced collapse of a massive white dwarf (WD). By simulating a realistic stellar population with both binaries and triples, we identify pathways to WD collapse that could produce FRB candidates. We find that (i) triple dynamics open new merger channels inaccessible to isolated binaries, significantly enhancing the overall merger rate; (ii) triple-induced mergers broaden the delay-time distribution, producing long-delay ($\gtrsim1$-8~Gyr) events largely independent of metallicity, alongside a shorter-delay population ($\lesssim100$~Myr) of rapid mergers; (iii) these long delays naturally yield FRBs in older environments such as quiescent host galaxies and galactic halos; (iv) when convolved with the cosmic star-formation history, binary channels track the star-formation rate ($z\_{\rm peak} \sim 2$), while triple channels peak later ($z\_{\rm peak} \sim 1$), giving a combined local source rate of $R\_0 \approx 2\times10^4~{\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, consistent with observations; and (v) applying the same framework to Type~Ia supernovae, we find that triples extend the delay-time tail and roughly double the Ia efficiency relative to binaries, yielding rates and redshift evolution in good agreement with observations. If FRBs originate from the collapse of WDs, our results establish triples, alongside binaries, as a crucial and previously overlooked formation pathway whose predicted rates, host demographics, and redshift evolution offer clear tests for upcoming surveys.

 The nature of dark energy is one of the big puzzling issues in cosmology. While $Λ$CDM provides a good fit to the observational data, evolving dark energy scenarios, such as the CPL parametrization, offer a compelling alternative. In this paper, we present a Bayesian model comparison of various dark energy parametrizations using a joint analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background data, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and the PantheonPlus (or Union3) Supernovae type Ia sample. We find that while the $Λ$CDM model is initially favored over a constant $w$CDM model, the CPL parametrization is significantly preferred over $w$CDM, reinforcing recent evidence for an evolving dark energy component, consistent with DESI collaboration findings. Crucially, when testing higher-order CPL extensions, the so-called CPL$^+$ and CPL$^{++}$, our Bayesian analysis shows that the observational data do not favor these more complex scenarios compared to the standard CPL. This result indicates that adding excessive complexity to the CPL form is unwarranted by current observations. Interestingly, similar to the CPL parametrization, alternative two-parameter forms, specifically $w\_{de}(a) = w\_0 + w\_b(1-a)^2$ and $w\_{de}(a) = w\_0 + w\_c(1-a)^3$, yield a better fit to observational data than the standard $Λ$CDM cosmology. Our results challenge the necessity for overly complex CPL extensions and confirm that well-chosen two-parameter $w\_0w\_a$ parametrizations effectively capture DE evolution with current cosmological data, supporting the recent signals for dynamical dark energy by DESI collaboration.

 The environmental density of galaxies within the cosmic web constrains their 3D locations in filaments, voids, groups, and clusters. It traces the distribution of baryons and the influence of dark-matter halos on galaxy evolution, and helps diagnose external processes such as supernova and AGN feedback, tidal interactions, ram-pressure stripping, and large-scale flows. We focus on isolated barred galaxies, the parent population that includes Milky Way analogs. To measure local environmental density and verify isolation (\|Delta v\| <= 500 km s^-1), we built a Python pipeline that works in two redshift regimes: low (z0 < 0.02) and high (z0 >= 0.02). Densities were estimated with k-nearest neighbors and Voronoi tessellations and classified as void (Sigma < 0.05), filament (0.05 <= Sigma < 0.5), group (0.5 <= Sigma < 2.0), and cluster (Sigma >= 2.0). Our northern-sky sample contains 311 isolated barred galaxies from 2MIG plus Milky Way analog systems (z < 0.07). We find 157 void, 84 filament, 27 group, and 11 cluster galaxies; 30 have no detected neighbors. Sixty-seven lie in extremely low-density regions (Sigma\_3D < 0.01 gal Mpc^-3), and 22 have the nearest companion beyond 5 Mpc, indicating residence in extended voids. The Milky Way (Sigma\_5NN ~ 0.13 gal Mpc^-3, R ~ 2.1 Mpc) and its close analog NGC 3521 both lie in filamentary environments at the edge of a nearby void. For z > 0.02 we identify three additional Milky Way analog candidates from the density metrics: CGCG 208-043 (3D Voronoi) and NGC 5231 and CGCG 047-026 (5th-nearest neighbor). These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.
