2024-11-05, **Leptogenesis and neutrino mass with scalar leptoquarks**, KÃ¥re Fridell et.al., [2411.03282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03282v1)

 Leptoquarks are known to generate a wide range of potentially observable phenomena, and have been searched for in different experiments. We show that the observed baryon asymmetry and neutrino mass scale can both be simultaneously produced in a model featuring scalar leptoquarks while avoiding existing experimental constraints and potentially leading to future observable signatures.

2024-11-05, **Data-driven model validation for neutrino-nucleus cross section measurements**, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., [2411.03280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03280v1)

 Neutrino-nucleus cross section measurements are needed to improve interaction modeling to meet the precision needs of neutrino experiments in efforts to measure oscillation parameters and search for physics beyond the Standard Model. We review the difficulties associated with modeling neutrino-nucleus interactions that lead to a dependence on event generators in oscillation analyses and cross section measurements alike. We then describe data-driven model validation techniques intended to address this model dependence. The method relies on utilizing various goodness-of-fit tests and the correlations between different observables and channels to probe the model for defects in the phase space relevant for the desired analysis. These techniques shed light on relevant mis-modeling, allowing it to be detected before it begins to bias the cross section results. We compare more commonly used model validation methods which directly validate the model against alternative ones to these data-driven techniques and show their efficacy with fake data studies. These studies demonstrate that employing data-driven model validation in cross section measurements represents a reliable strategy to produce robust results that will stimulate the desired improvements to interaction modeling.

2024-11-05, **A-STEP: The AstroPix Sounding Rocket Technology Demonstration Payload**, Daniel P. Violette et.al., [2411.03165v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03165v1)

 A next-generation medium-energy (100 keV to 100 MeV) gamma-ray observatory will greatly enhance the identification and characterization of multimessenger sources in the coming decade. Coupling gamma-ray spectroscopy, imaging, and polarization to neutrino and gravitational wave detections will develop our understanding of various astrophysical phenomena including compact object mergers, supernovae remnants, active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts. An observatory operating in the MeV energy regime requires technologies that are capable of measuring Compton scattered photons and photons interacting via pair production. AstroPix is a monolithic high voltage CMOS active pixel sensor which enables future gamma-ray telescopes in this energy range. AstroPix's design is iterating towards low-power (~1.5 mW/cm$^{2}$), high spatial (500 microns pixel pitch) and spectral (<5 keV at 122 keV) tracking of photon and charged particle interactions. Stacking planar arrays of AstroPix sensors in three dimensions creates an instrument capable of reconstructing the trajectories and energies of incident gamma rays over large fields of view. A prototype multi-layered AstroPix instrument, called the AstroPix Sounding rocket Technology dEmonstration Payload (A-STEP), will test three layers of AstroPix quad chips in a suborbital rocket flight. These quad chips (2x2 joined AstroPix sensors) form the 4x4 cm$^{2}$ building block of future large area AstroPix instruments, such as ComPair-2 and AMEGO-X. This payload will be the first demonstration of AstroPix detectors operated in a space environment and will demonstrate the technology's readiness for future astrophysical and nuclear physics applications. In this work, we overview the design and state of development of the ASTEP payload.

2024-11-05, **Neutrino Electromagnetic Properties**, Carlo Giunti et.al., [2411.03122v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03122v1)

 Neutrinos are neutral in the Standard Model, but they have tiny charge radii generated by radiative corrections. In theories Beyond the Standard Model, neutrinos can also have magnetic and electric moments and small electric charges (millicharges). We review the general theory of neutrino electromagnetic form factors, which reduce, for ultrarelativistic neutrinos and small momentum transfers, to the neutrino charges, effective charge radii, and effective magnetic moments. We discuss the phenomenology of these electromagnetic neutrino properties and we review the existing experimental bounds. We briefly review also the electromagnetic processes of astrophysical neutrinos and the neutrino magnetic moment portal in the presence of sterile neutrinos.

2024-11-05, **Forecast constraints on neutrino mass from CSST galaxy clusters**, Mingjing Chen et.al., [2411.02752v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02752v1)

 With the advent of next-generation surveys, constraints on cosmological parameters are anticipated to become more stringent, particularly for the total neutrino mass. This study forecasts these constraints utilizing galaxy clusters from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). Employing Fisher matrix analysis, we derive the constraint $\sigma(M\_\nu)$ from cluster number counts, cluster power spectrum, and their combination. The investigation ranges from the standard cosmological model with neutrinos $\nu\Lambda$CDM to the inclusion of dynamic dark energy in the $\nu w\_0 w\_a$CDM model, revealing a minor impact of dark energy on neutrino constraints. We examine the largest source of systematic uncertainty arising from the mass-observable relation and find that, with perfect knowledge of the scaling relation parameters, CSST clusters have the potential to enhance precision, tightening constraints to $0.034$ eV. We also study the effects of the maximum redshift $z\_{max}$ and other uncertainties, including redshift, halo mass function, and bias. Furthermore, we emphasize the significance of accounting for the growth-induced scale-dependent bias (GISDB) effect, which is expected to have an impact of 1.5 to 2.2 times on the final constraint.

2024-11-05, **Search for a Hidden Sector Scalar from Kaon Decay in the Di-Muon Final State at ICARUS**, ICARUS Collaboration et.al., [2411.02727v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02727v1)

 We present a search for long-lived particles (LLPs) produced from kaon decay that decay to two muons inside the ICARUS neutrino detector. This channel would be a signal of hidden sector models that can address outstanding issues in particle physics such as the strong CP problem and the microphysical origin of dark matter. The search is performed with data collected in the Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam at Fermilab corresponding to $2.41\times 10^{20}$ protons-on-target. No new physics signal is observed, and we set world-leading limits on heavy QCD axions, as well as for the Higgs portal scalar among dedicated searches. Limits are also presented in a model-independent way applicable to any new physics model predicting the process $K\to \pi+S(\to\mu\mu)$, for a long-lived particle S. This result is the first search for new physics performed with the ICARUS detector at Fermilab. It paves the way for the future program of long-lived particle searches at ICARUS.

2024-11-05, **Line of Sight Bias in Dark Matter Inferences from Galaxy Cluster Mergers**, David Wittman et.al., [2411.03276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03276v1)

 In collisions of galaxy clusters, the lack of displacement between dark matter and galaxies suggests that the dark matter scattering depth is small. This yields an upper limit on the dark matter cross section if the dark matter column density is known. We investigate a bias in such constraints: the measured column density (along the line of sight, using gravitational lensing) is lower than that experienced by a dark matter particle, as follows. Dark matter halos are triaxial and generally collide along their major axes, yielding a high scattering column density -- but the merger is obvious only to observers whose line of sight is nearly perpendicular to that axis, yielding a low observed column density. We trace lines of sight through merging halos from the BigMDPL n-body simulation, both with and without mock observational effects. We find that a hypothetical skewer through the halo along the merger axis (more precisely, along the current separation vector of the two halos) has twice the column density of a typical line of sight. With weak lensing measurements, which involve some spatial averaging, this ratio is reduced to 1.25, suggesting that existing constraints on the scattering cross section are biased high by about 25%.

2024-11-05, **The tidal evolution of anisotropic subhaloes: A new pathway to creating isotropic and cored satellites**, Barry T. Chiang et.al., [2411.03192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03192v1)

 It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised $N$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.

2024-11-05, **Weak lensing constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation of galaxy groups with simulation-informed scatter**, Shun-Sheng Li et.al., [2411.03152v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03152v1)

 Understanding the scaling relation between baryonic observables and dark matter halo properties is crucial not only for studying galaxy formation and evolution, but also for deriving accurate cosmological constraints from galaxy surveys. In this paper, we constrain the stellar-to-halo mass relation of galaxy groups identified by the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey, using weak lensing signals measured by the Kilo-Degree Survey. We compared our measured scaling relation with predictions from the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations and the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model. We find general agreement between our measurements and simulation predictions for haloes with masses ${\gtrsim}10^{13.5}\ h\_{70}^{-1}{\rm M}\_{\odot}$, but observe slight discrepancies with the FLAMINGO simulations at lower halo masses. We explored improvements to the current halo model framework by incorporating simulation-informed scatter in the group stellar mass distribution as a function of halo mass. We find that including a simulation-informed scatter model tightens the constraints on scaling relations, despite the current data statistics being insufficient to directly constrain the variable scatter. We also tested the robustness of our results against different statistical models of miscentring effects from selected central galaxies. We find that accounting for miscentring is essential, but our current measurements do not distinguish among different miscentring models.

2024-11-05, **Effects of black hole environments on extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters**, Ya-Ze Cheng et.al., [2411.03095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03095v1)

 Extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters (EMRHEs) around the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) will be observable at the future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji. Here we consider such EMRHEs in the presence of surrounding matter distribution including baryonic accretion disk and dark matter (DM) spike, and estimate their effects on the orbital evolution and GW waveforms. We find that large possible impacts come from the gravitational potential of accretion disk, while the influence of DM spike is small. We also illustrate that environments can leave distinctive imprints on the GW waveforms, but resolving such modifications is found to be challenging for LISA-like detectors in the near future.

2024-11-05, **Mass & Light in Galaxy Clusters: Parametric Strong Lensing Approach**, Marceau Limousin et.al., [2411.03075v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03075v1)

 Parametric strong lensing studies of galaxy clusters often display misleading features: group/cluster scale dark matter components without any stellar counterpart, offsets between both components larger than what might be allowed by neither Cold Dark Matter nor self interacting Dark Matter models, or significant unexplained external shear components. I am revisiting mass models where such misleading (and interesting) features have been reported, adopting the following working hypothesis: any group or cluster scale dark matter clump introduced in the modelling should be associated with a luminous counterpart, and any well motivated and reliable prior should be considered, even when this degrades the fit. The goal is to derive a physically motivated description of the dark matter component which might be compared to theoretical expectations. I succeed doing so in galaxy clusters AS 1063, MACS J0416 and MACS J1206, finding that the shape of the inner dark matter component has a flat density profile. These findings may be useful for the interpretation within dark matter scenario, such as self-interacting dark matter. I fail in Abell 370: a three dark matter clumps mass model (each clump being associated with its stellar counterpart) is unable to reproduce the observational constraints with a precision smaller than 2.3 arcsec. In order to provide a sub arcsec precision, I need to describe the dark matter distribution using a four dark matter clumps model, as found in earlier works. Examining the total projected mass maps, I however find a good agreement between the total mass and the stellar distribution in Abell 370, both being, to first order, bimodal. I interpret the misleading features as being symptomatic of the lack of realism of a parametric description of the dark matter distribution. I encourage caution and criticism on the outputs of parametric strong lensing modelling.

2024-11-05, **Constraining ultralight scalar dark matter couplings with the European Pulsar Timing Array second data release**, Yu-Mei Wu et.al., [2411.02915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02915v1)

 Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) offer an independent method for searching for ultralight dark matter (ULDM), whose wavelike nature induces periodic oscillations in the arrival times of radio pulses. In addition to this gravitational effect, the direct coupling between ULDM and ordinary matter results in pulsar spin fluctuations and reference clock shifts, leading to observable effects in PTAs. The second data release from the European PTA (EPTA) indicates that ULDM cannot account for all dark matter in the mass range $m\_{\phi} \in [10^{-24.0}, 10^{-23.3}] \text{ eV}$ based solely on gravitational effects. In this work, we derive constraints on the coupling coefficients by considering both gravitational and coupling effects. Our results demonstrate that EPTA provides stronger constraints on these couplings than previous PTA experiments, and it establishes similar or even tighter constraints compared to other precise experiments, such as atomic clock experiments.

2024-11-05, **Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space**, L. Cacciapuoti et.al., [2411.02912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02912v1)

 The Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES) mission is developing high performance clocks and links for space to test Einstein's theory of general relativity. From the International Space Station, the ACES payload will distribute a clock signal with fractional frequency stability and accuracy of 1E-16 establishing a worldwide network to compare clocks in space and on the ground. ACES will provide an absolute measurement of Einstein's gravitational redshift, it will search for time variations of fundamental constants, contribute to test topological dark matter models, and perform Standard Model Extension tests. Moreover, the ground clocks connected to the ACES network will be compared over different continents and used to measure geopotential differences at the clock locations. After solving some technical problems, the ACES flight model is now approaching its completion. System tests involving the laser-cooled Cs clock PHARAO, the active H-maser SHM and the on-board frequency comparator FCDP have measured the performance of the clock signal delivered by ACES. The ACES microwave link MWL is currently under test. The single-photon avalanche detector of the optical link ELT has been tested and will now be integrated in the ACES payload. The ACES mission concept, its scientific objectives, and the recent test results are discussed here together with the major milestones that will lead us to the ACES launch.

2024-11-05, **Non-Gaussianity in CMB lensing from full-sky simulations**, Jan Hamann et.al., [2411.02774v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02774v1)

 The lensing convergence field describing the weak lensing effect of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is expected to be subject to mild deviations from Gaussianity. We perform a suite of full-sky lensing simulations using ray tracing through multiple lens planes - generated by combining $N$-body simulations on smaller scales and low-to-intermediate redshifts with realisations of Gaussian random fields on large scales and at high redshifts. We quantify the non-Gaussianity of the resulting convergence fields in terms of a set of skewness and kurtosis parameters and show that the non-Gaussian information in these maps can be used to constrain cosmological parameters such as the cold dark matter density $\Omega\_\mathrm{c} h^2$ or the amplitude of primordial curvature perturbations $A\_\mathrm{s}$. We forecast that for future CMB lensing observations, combining the non-Gaussian parameters with the Gaussian information can increase constraining power on $(\Omega\_\mathrm{c} h^2, A\_\mathrm{s})$ by $30$-$40\%$ compared to constraints from Gaussian observables alone. We make the simulation code for the full-sky lensing simulation available for download from GitHub.

2024-11-05, **Dispersion Measures of Fast Radio Bursts through the Epoch of Reionization**, Joshua J. Ziegler et.al., [2411.02699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02699v1)

 Dispersion measures (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) probe the density of electrons in the intergalactic medium (IGM) along their lines-of-sight, including the average density versus distance to the source and its variations in direction. While previous study focused on low-redshift, FRBs are potentially detectable out to high redshift, where their DMs can, in principle, probe the epoch of reionization (EOR) and its patchiness. We present the first predictions from large-scale, radiation-hydrodynamical simulation of fully-coupled galaxy formation and reionization, using Cosmic Dawn (``CoDa")~II to model the density and ionization fields of the universe down to redshifts through the end of the EOR at $z\_{re}\approx6.1$. Combining this with an N-body simulation CoDa~II--Dark Matter of the fully-ionized epoch from the EOR to the present, we calculate the mean and standard deviation of FRB DMs as functions of their source redshift. The mean and standard deviation of DM increase with redshift, reaching a plateau by $z(x\_{HII}\lesssim0.25)\gtrsim8$, i.e. well above $z\_{re}$. The mean-DM asymptote $\mathcal{DM}\_{max} \approx 5900~\mathrm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$ reflects the end of the EOR and its duration. The standard deviation there is $\sigma\_{DM, max}\approx497 ~\mathrm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$, reflecting inhomogeneities of both patchy reionization and density. Inhomogeneities in ionization during the EOR contribute $\mathcal{O}(1$ per cent) of this value of $\sigma\_{DM,max}$ from FRBs at redshifts $z\gtrsim 8$. Current estimates of FRB rates suggest this may be detectable within a few years of observation.

2024-11-05, **How the StarDICE photometric calibration of standard stars can improve cosmological constraints?**, T. Souverin et.al., [2411.03256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03256v1)

 The number of type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) observations will grow significantly within the next decade, mainly thanks to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) undertaken by the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile. With this improvement, statistical uncertainties will decrease, and flux calibration will become the main uncertainty for the characterization of dark energy. Currently, the astronomical flux scale is anchored on the numerical models of white dwarf atmospheres from the CALSPEC catalog, and every error on the model can induce a bias over cosmological parameters inference. The StarDICE experiment proposes a new calibration reference that only relies on observations from the optical watt defined by the NIST towards the magnitude of standard stars. It is currently operating at l'Observatoire de Haute-Provence and has been collecting data since the beginning of 2023. To overcome the photometric calibration uncertainty and reach a sub-percent precision, the instrument throughput has been calibrated with a Collimated Beam Projector. It will be monitored on-site with a LED-based artificial star source calibrated with NIST photodiodes. In this proceeding, we will first illustrate how an error in the photometric calibration can impact the SNe Ia distance moduli and thus bias the measurement of cosmological parameters. Then we will present the StarDICE experiment and how we can recalibrate the CALSPEC catalog at the millimagnitude level on the NIST scale with photometric analysis.
