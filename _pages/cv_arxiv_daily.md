2023-04-13, **Constraining low-scale dark phase transitions with cosmological observations**, Shihao Deng et.al., [2304.06576v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06576v1)

 We investigate the effects of the low-scale cosmological first-order phase transitions on the neutrino decoupling and constrain the PT parameters with the cosmological observations of big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background. We consider the phase transitions that occur at the MeV-scale which can produce stochastic gravitational wave background to be probed by pulsar timing array experiments. We find that the phase transition can modify the effective number of neutrinos and the primordial nucleosynthesis. In turn, the cosmological observations can exclude slow and strong phase transitions around the MeV scale.

2023-04-13, **Testing electroweak scale seesaw models at $e^{-} γ$ and $γ γ$ colliders**, Arindam Das et.al., [2304.06298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06298v1)

 We investigate the possibilities of probing the electroweak scale seesaw scenarios such as type-I, type-II and type-III seesaw at $e^-\gamma$ and $\gamma\gamma$ colliders. For the case of type-I seesaw, the heavy neutrinos can be produced at $e^{-}\gamma$ colliders in association with a $W$ boson. We study a variety of final states in this case including single and multilepton modes in association with jets to estimate bounds on the light-heavy neutrino mixing angle. In case of type-II seesaw, doubly charged multiplets of the SU$(2)\_L$ triplet scalar can be produced in pair at $\gamma \gamma$ collider. We study the multi-leptonic decay modes coming from this pair production of doubly charged Higgs and show how one can probe neutrino mass hierarchy. We also study same sign $W$ boson production from the doubly charged Higgs to study multilepton modes in association with missing energy. From the type-III seesaw, we study same sign dilepton+jets and trilepton+jets modes at $e^-\gamma$ collider which are coming from the neutral and charged component of the triplet fermion in association with a $W$ boson and $Z$ boson, respectively. Due to the existing limits on the triplet fermions from the LHC we choose heavier mass so that the gauge boson originated from the decay of a neutral multiplet can be sufficiently boosted producing a fat-jet signature in association with same sign dilepton and trilepton. Finally we estimate bounds on the light neutrino-heavy triplet fermion mixing angle and compare with the existing bounds.

2023-04-13, **Neutrino Mass in Non-Supersymmetric $SO(10)$ GUT**, Naoyuki Haba et.al., [2304.06263v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06263v1)

 We study a prediction on neutrino observables in a non-supersymmetric renormalizable $SO(10)$ GUT model that contains a ${\bf 10}$ complex scalar field and a ${\bf 126}$ scalar field whose Yukawa couplings with ${\bf 16}$ matter fields provide the quark and charged lepton Yukawa couplings, neutrino Dirac Yukawa coupling and Majorana mass for the singlet neutrinos. The $SO(10)$ breaking is achieved in two steps by a ${\cal O}(10^{15})$ GeV VEV of a ${\bf 54}$ real scalar field and a ${\cal O}(10^{14})$ GeV VEV of the ${\bf 126}$ field. First, we analyze the gauge coupling unification conditions and determine the VEV of the ${\bf 126}$ field. Next, we constrain the Yukawa couplings of the ${\bf 10}$ and ${\bf 126}$ fields at the scale of the ${\bf 126}$ field's VEV from experimental data on quark and charged lepton masses and quark flavor mixings. Then we express the active neutrino mass with the above Yukawa couplings and the ${\bf 126}$ field's VEV based on the Type-1 seesaw mechanism, and fit neutrino oscillation data, thereby deriving a prediction on poorly or not measured neutrino observables. What distinguishes our work from previous studies is that we do not assign Peccei-Quinn charges on visible sector fields so that the ${\bf 10}$ scalar field and its complex conjugate both have Yukawa couplings with ${\bf 16}$ matter fields. From the fitting of neutrino oscillation data, we find that not only the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, but also the inverted hierarchy can be realized. We also reveal that in the normal hierarchy case, the Dirac CP phase of the neutrino mixing matrix $\delta\_{CP}$ is likely in the ranges of $-2.4<\delta\_{\rm CP}<-1.2$ and $1.2<\delta\_{\rm CP}<2.4$, and not in the region with $\delta\_{\rm CP}\sim\pi$, and that in the normal hierarchy case, $\theta\_{23}$ is likely in the upper octant and in the range of $0.50\lesssim\sin^2\theta\_{23}\lesssim0.55$.

2023-04-12, **Precision measurement of the index of refraction of deep glacial ice at radio frequencies at Summit Station, Greenland**, J. A. Aguilar et.al., [2304.06181v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06181v1)

 Glacial ice is used as a target material for the detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos, by measuring the radio signals that are emitted when those neutrinos interact in the ice. Thanks to the large attenuation length at radio frequencies, these signals can be detected over distances of several kilometers. One experiment taking advantage of this is the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G), currently under construction at Summit Station, near the apex of the Greenland ice sheet. These experiments require a thorough understanding of the dielectric properties of ice at radio frequencies. Towards this goal, calibration campaigns have been undertaken at Summit, during which we recorded radio reflections off internal layers in the ice sheet. Using data from the nearby GISP2 and GRIP ice cores, we show that these reflectors can be associated with features in the ice conductivity profiles; we use this connection to determine the index of refraction of the bulk ice as n=1.778 +/- 0.006.

2023-04-12, **Nuclear recoil response of liquid xenon and its impact on solar 8B neutrino and dark matter searches**, X. Xiang et.al., [2304.06142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06142v1)

 Knowledge of the ionization and scintillation responses of liquid xenon (LXe) to nuclear recoils is crucial for LXe-based dark matter experiments. Current calibrations carry large uncertainties in the low-energy region below $\sim3$ keV$\_nr$ where signals from dark matter particles of $<$10 GeV/c$^2$ masses are expected. The coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) by solar $^8$B neutrinos also results in a continuum of nuclear recoil events below 3.0 keV$\_{nr}$ (99\% of events), which further complicates low-mass dark matter searches in LXe experiments. In this paper, we describe a method to quantify the uncertainties of low-energy LXe responses using published calibration data, followed by case studies to evaluate the impact of yield uncertainties on ${^8}$B searches and low-mass dark matter sensitivity in a typical ton-scale LXe experiment. We conclude that naively omitting yield uncertainties leads to overly optimistic limits by factor $\sim2$ for a 6 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass. Future nuclear recoil light yield calibrations could allow experiments to recover this sensitivity and also improve the accuracy of solar ${^8}$B flux measurements.

2023-04-12, **NEXT-CRAB-0: A High Pressure Gaseous Xenon Time Projection Chamber with a Direct VUV Camera Based Readout**, NEXT Collaboration et.al., [2304.06091v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06091v1)

 The search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) remains one of the most compelling experimental avenues for the discovery in the neutrino sector. Electroluminescent gas-phase time projection chambers are well suited to $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches due to their intrinsically precise energy resolution and topological event identification capabilities. Scalability to ton- and multi-ton masses requires readout of large-area electroluminescent regions with fine spatial resolution, low radiogenic backgrounds, and a scalable data acquisition system. This paper presents a detector prototype that records event topology in an electroluminescent xenon gas TPC via VUV image-intensified cameras. This enables an extendable readout of large tracking planes with commercial devices that reside almost entirely outside of the active medium.Following further development in intermediate scale demonstrators, this technique may represent a novel and enlargeable method for topological event imaging in $0\nu\beta\beta$.

2023-04-12, **Heavy neutrino signatures from leptophilic Higgs portal in the linear seesaw**, Aditya Batra et.al., [2304.06080v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06080v1)

 Lepton collider setups can probe the neutrino sector in the linear seesaw mechanism. Small neutrino masses are sourced by a tiny vacuum expectation value of a leptophilic scalar Higgs doublet and are mediated by Quasi-Dirac heavy neutrinos. These new particles can all be accessible to colliders. We describe novel charged Higgs and heavy neutrino production mechanisms that can be sizeable at $e^{+} e^{-}$ or $e^{-} {\gamma}$ colliders and discuss some of the associated signatures. These may shed light on the Majorana nature of neutrinos and the role of lepton number and lepton flavour symmetries.

2023-04-12, **Stellar Signals of a Baryon-Number-Violating Long-Range Force**, Hooman Davoudiasl et.al., [2304.06071v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06071v1)

 We entertain the novel possibility that long range forces may lead to violations of accidental symmetries, in particular baryon number. Employing an ultralight scalar, with a mass $\ll$ eV, we illustrate that this scenario can lead to vastly disparate nucleon lifetimes, in different astronomical objects. Such a long range interaction can yield a number of potentially observable effects, such as a flux of neutrinos at $\gtrsim 10$ MeV from the Sun and heating of old neutron stars. We examine the prospects for constraining this scenario, with current and future astrophysical data, and find that neutron star heating provides the strongest present and near term bounds. Simple extensions of our setup allow for the ultralight scalar to constitute the dark matter of the Universe. This suggests that matter-enhanced baryon number violation can be a signal of ultralight dark matter, which has apparently been overlooked, so far.

2023-04-12, **Probing neutrino production in high-energy astrophysical neutrino sources with the Glashow Resonance**, Qinrui Liu et.al., [2304.06068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06068v1)

 The flavor composition of high-energy neutrinos carries important information about their birth. However, the two most common production scenarios, $pp$ (hadronuclear) and $p\gamma$ (photohadronic) processes, lead to the same flavor ratios when neutrinos and antineutrinos cannot be distinguished. The Glashow resonant interaction $\bar{\nu}\_e+e^- \rightarrow W^-$ becomes a window to differentiate the antineutrino contribution from the total diffuse neutrino flux, thus lifting this degeneracy. We examine the power of Glashow resonant events in measuring the fraction of the $\bar{\nu}\_e$ flux with current IceCube data, and produce projected sensitivities based on the combined exposure of planned Cherenkov neutrino telescopes around the globe. We find that $pp$ and $p\gamma$ can be distinguished at a 2$\sigma$ significance level in the next decades, in both an event-wise analysis and a more conservative statistical analysis, even with pessimistic assumptions on the spectral index of the astrophysical flux. Finally, we consider the sensitivity of future experiments to mixed production mechanisms.

2023-04-12, **Assisted neutrino pair production in combined external fields**, Naser Ahmadiniaz et.al., [2304.05711v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05711v1)

 Neutrino--antineutrino ($\nu\bar\nu$) pair production is one of the main processes responsible for the energy loss of stars. Apart from the collision of two ($\gamma\gamma\to\nu\bar\nu$) or three ($\gamma\gamma\gamma\to\nu\bar\nu$) real photons, photon decay and photon collisions in the presence of nuclear Coulomb fields or external magnetic fields have been considered previously. Here, we study the low-energy photon decay into a pair of neutrino and antineutrino in the presence of a combined homogeneous magnetic field and the Coulomb field of a nucleus with charge number $Z$.

2023-04-12, **Future leptonic CP phase determination in the presence of NSI**, Luis A. Delgadillo et.al., [2304.05545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05545v1)

 The precise determination of the leptonic CP phase is one of the major goals for future generation Long Baseline experiments. On the other hand, if new physics beyond the Standard Model exists, a robust determination of such a CP phase may be a challenge. Moreover, it has been pointed out that, in this scenario, an apparent discrepancy in the CP phase measurement at different experiments may arise. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the determination of the Dirac CP-phase at several long-baseline configurations: ESSnuSB, T2HKK, and a DUNE-like experiment. We use the non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) formalism as a framework. We found that complementary between ESSnuSB and a DUNE-like experiment enhances the robustness in the determination of the CP-phase, even in the presence of matter NSI. Moreover, the T2HKK proposal can help to constrain the matter NSI parameters.

2023-04-13, **Addressing the self-interaction for ELDER dark matter from the 21-cm signal**, Rupa Basu et.al., [2304.06680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06680v1)

 The self-interacting dark matter can affect various cosmological processes. Such interactions can be number conserving (\emph{e.g.} $2 \rightarrow 2$) or number violating (\emph{e.g.} $3 \rightarrow 2,\,4 \rightarrow 2$ etc.). The latter processes where three (or more) dark matter particles undergo self-annihilation/scattering to produce less number of dark matter is termed as ``Cannibalism'' process. In this work, the self-interaction of dark matter and the strength of such interactions are investigated in the light of experimental results of the global 21-cm spectrum of neural hydrogen from the era of cosmic dawn. From the present work, it appears that $2\rightarrow 2$ process is much more dominant over the $3\rightarrow 2$ process. It is also found that such interactions affect the dark matter-baryon elastic scattering cross-section. The study also indicates the presence of multi component dark matter of different mass range in the Universe.

2023-04-13, **Chaotic interactions between dark matter and dark energy**, E. Aydiner et.al., [2304.06614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06614v1)

 In this study, we consider dark matter and dark energy as grand-canonical systems which are open, non-equilibrium coupled, and interacting systems. It is the first time, we propose a new more realistic interaction schema to explain dynamics between coupled interacting thermodynamic systems. Based on this new interaction schema, we propose new theorems to define the interactions. We proved the theorems based on the energy conservation law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, we obtain new coupled equations using the theorems. We numerically solve the interaction equations and obtained phase space diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. We show that the interaction between dark matter and dark energy is chaotic. We conclude that these theorems and results can be generalized to all coupled interacting non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we give a new definition of chaos.

2023-04-13, **On the anti-correlation between pericentric distance and inner dark matter density of Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal galaxies**, Salvador Cardona-Barrero et.al., [2304.06611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06611v1)

 An anti-correlation between the central density of the dark matter halo ($\rho\_{150,\ {\rm DM}}$) and the pericentric distances ($r\_{p}$) of the Milky Way's (MW's) dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) has been reported in the literature. The existence and origin of such anti-correlation is however controversial, one possibility being that only the densest dSphs can survive the tidal field towards the centre of our Galaxy. In this work, we place particular emphasis on quantifying the statistical significance of such anti-correlation, by using available literature data in order to explore its robustness under different assumptions on the MW gravitational potential, and for various derivations of $\rho\_{150}$ and $r\_{p}$. We consider models in which the MW is isolated and has a low ($8.8\times10^{11}\,M\_{\odot}$) and high ($1.6\times10^{12}\, M\_{\odot}$) halo mass, respectively, as well as configurations in which the MW's potential is perturbed by a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) infall. We find that, while data generally support models in which the dSphs' central DM density decreases as a function of their pericentric radius, this anti-correlation is statistically significant at $3\sigma$ level only in $\sim$12$\%$ of the combinations of $\rho\_{150}$ and $r\_{p}$ explored. Moreover, including the impact of the LMC's infall onto the MW weakens or even washes away this anti-correlation, with respect to models in which the MW is isolated. Our results suggest that the strength and existence of such anti-correlation is still debatable: exploring it with high-resolution simulations including baryonic physics and different DM flavours will help us to understand its emergence.

2023-04-13, **On the use of dielectric elements in axion searches with microwave resonant cavities**, Xiran Bai et.al., [2304.06562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06562v1)

 This study explores the primary effects of dielectric materials in a resonant cavity-based search for axion dark matter. While dielectrics prove beneficial in numerous cases, their incorporation may lead to less-than-optimal performance, especially for the lowest TM mode. Additionally, the stronger confinement of the electric field inside the dielectrics can exacerbate mode mixings, in particular for higher-order modes. Case studies have been carried out using a combination of analytical solutions and numerical simulations. The findings indicate dielectric cavities employing the $\text{TM}\_{010}$ mode experience a significant reduction in sensitivity when compared to a similar search conducted in a cavity at equivalent frequency using no dielectrics.

2023-04-13, **Fermionic Dark Matter: Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology**, C. R. Arguüelles et.al., [2304.06329v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06329v1)

 The nature of dark matter (DM) is one of the most relevant questions in modern astrophysics. We present a brief overview of recent results that inquire into a possible fermionic quantum nature of the DM particles, focusing mainly on the interconnection between the microphysics of the neutral fermions {and the macrophysical structure of galactic halos, including their formation both in the linear and non-linear cosmological regimes. We discuss the general relativistic Ruffini-Arg\"uelles-Rueda (RAR) model of fermionic DM in galaxies, its applications to the Milky Way, the possibility that the Galactic center harbors a DM core instead of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), the S-cluster stellar orbits with an in-depth analysis of the S2's orbit including precession, the application of the RAR model to other galaxy types (dwarf, elliptic, big elliptic and galaxy clusters), and universal galaxy relations. All the above focusing on the model parameters constraints, most relevant to the fermion mass. We also connect the RAR model fermions with particle physics DM candidates, self-interactions, and galactic observables constraints. The formation and stability of core-halo galactic structures predicted by the RAR model and their relation to warm DM cosmologies are also treated. Finally, we briefly discuss how gravitational lensing, dynamical friction, and the formation of SMBHs can also probe the DM nature.

2023-04-13, **Exploring Mirror Twin Higgs Cosmology with Present and Future Weak Lensing Surveys**, Lei Zu et.al., [2304.06308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06308v1)

 We explore the potential of precision cosmological data to study non-minimal dark sectors by updating the cosmological constraint on the mirror twin Higgs model (MTH). The MTH model addresses the Higgs little hierarchy problem by introducing dark sector particles. In this work, we perform a Bayesian global analysis that includes the latest cosmic shear measurement from the DES three-year survey and the Planck CMB and BAO data. In the early Universe, the mirror baryon and mirror radiation behave as dark matter and dark radiation, and their presence modifies the Universe's expansion history. Additionally, the scattering between mirror baryon and photon generates the dark acoustic oscillation process, suppressing the matter power spectrum from the cosmic shear measurement. We demonstrate how current data constrain these corrections to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find that for a viable solution to the little hierarchy problem, the proportion of MTH dark matter cannot exceed about $30\%$ of the total dark matter density, unless the temperature of twin photon is less than $30\%$ of that of the standard model photon. While the MTH model is presently not a superior solution to the observed $H\_0$ tension compared to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\Delta N\_{\rm eff}$ model, we demonstrate that it has the potential to alleviate both the $H\_0$ and $S\_8$ tensions, especially if the $S\_8$ tension persists in the future and approaches the result reported by the Planck SZ (2013) analysis. In this case, the MTH model can relax the tensions while satisfying the DES power spectrum constraint up to $k \lesssim 10~h\rm {Mpc}^{-1}$. If the MTH model is indeed accountable for the $S\_8$ and $H\_0$ tensions, we show that the future China Space Station Telescope (CSST) can determine the twin baryon abundance with a $10\%$ level precision.

2023-04-12, **Rotation curves of galaxies in GR**, Luca Ciotti et.al., [2304.06151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06151v1)

 It has been suggested that the observed flat rotation curves of disk galaxies can be a peculiar effect of General Relativity (GR) rather than evidence for the presence of dark matter (DM) halos in Newtonian gravity. In Ciotti (2022) the problem has been quantitatively addressed by using the well known weak-field, low-velocity gravitomagnetic limit of GR, for realistic exponential baryonic (stellar) disks. As expected, the resulting GR and Newtonian rotation curves are indistinguishable, with GR corrections at all radii of the order of $v^2/c^2\approx 10^{-6}$. Here we list some astrophysical problems that must be faced if the existence of DM halos is attributed to a misinterpretation of weak field effects of GR.

2023-04-12, **Fast emulation of cosmological density fields based on dimensionality reduction and supervised machine-learning**, Miguel Conceição et.al., [2304.06099v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06099v1)

 N-body simulations are the most powerful method to study the non-linear evolution of large-scale structure. However, they require large amounts of computational resources, making unfeasible their direct adoption in scenarios that require broad explorations of parameter spaces. In this work, we show that it is possible to perform fast dark matter density field emulations with competitive accuracy using simple machine-learning approaches. We build an emulator based on dimensionality reduction and machine learning regression combining simple Principal Component Analysis and supervised learning methods. For the estimations with a single free parameter, we train on the dark matter density parameter, $\Omega\_m$, while for emulations with two free parameters, we train on a range of $\Omega\_m$ and redshift. The method first adopts a projection of a grid of simulations on a given basis; then, a machine learning regression is trained on this projected grid. Finally, new density cubes for different cosmological parameters can be estimated without relying directly on new N-body simulations by predicting and de-projecting the basis coefficients. We show that the proposed emulator can generate density cubes at non-linear cosmological scales with density distributions within a few percent compared to the corresponding N-body simulations. The method enables gains of three orders of magnitude in CPU run times compared to performing a full N-body simulation while reproducing the power spectrum and bispectrum within $\sim 1\%$ and $\sim 3\%$, respectively, for the single free parameter emulation and $\sim 5\%$ and $\sim 15\%$ for two free parameters. This can significantly accelerate the generation of density cubes for a wide variety of cosmological models, opening the doors to previously unfeasible applications, such as parameter and model inferences at full survey scales as the ESA/NASA Euclid mission.

2023-04-12, **Imprint of the galactic acceleration scale on globular cluster systems: Galaxies in the Fornax Cluster**, Michal Bílek et.al., [2304.06092v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06092v1)

 Dark matter is required in galaxies at galactocentric radii that are larger than the $a\_0$-radius, which is where the gravitational acceleration generated by baryons of the galaxy equals the constant $a\_0=1.2\times 10^{-10}$ms$^{-2}$ known as the galactic acceleration scale. It was found previously for massive early-type galaxies that the radial number-density profiles of their globular cluster (GC) systems follow broken power laws and the breaks occur at the $a\_0$-radii. We have newly analyzed the distribution of GCs around galaxies in the Fornax cluster in existing photometric catalogs. We found that 1) the coincidence between $a\_0$-radii and the break radii of globular cluster systems is valid for early-type galaxies of all masses and, 2) this also applies to the red and blue sub-populations of GCs separately.

2023-04-12, **Inelastic Freeze-in**, Saniya Heeba et.al., [2304.06072v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06072v1)

 Dark matter (DM) could be a nonthermal relic that freezes in from extremely weak, sub-Hubble annihilation and decay of Standard Model (SM) particles. The case of Dirac DM freezing in via a dark photon mediator is a well-studied benchmark for DM direct detection experiments. Here, we extend prior work to take into account the possibility that DM is pseudo-Dirac with a small mass splitting. If the mass splitting is greater than twice the electron mass but less than the dark photon mass, there will be distinct cosmological signatures. The excited state $\chi\_2$ is initially produced in equal abundance to the ground state $\chi\_1$. Subsequently, the excited state population decays at relatively late cosmological times, primarily via the three-body process $\chi\_2 \rightarrow \chi\_1 e^+ e^-$. This process injects energetic electrons into the ambient environment, providing observable signatures involving Big Bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background spectral distortions and anisotropies, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Furthermore, the ground state particles that are populated from the three-body decay receive a velocity kick, with implications for DM clustering on small scales. We find that cosmological probes and accelerator experiments are highly complementary, with future coverage of much of the parameter space of the model.

2023-04-12, **Flashlights: Properties of Highly Magnified Images Near Cluster Critical Curves in the Presence of Dark Matter Subhalos**, Liliya L. R. Williams et.al., [2304.06064v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06064v1)

 Dark matter subhalos with extended profiles and density cores, and globular stars clusters of mass $10^6-10^8 M\_\odot$, that live near the critical curves in galaxy cluster lenses can potentially be detected through their lensing magnification of stars in background galaxies. In this work we study the effect such subhalos have on lensed images, and compare to the case of more well studied microlensing by stars and black holes near critical curves. We find that the cluster density gradient and the extended mass distribution of subhalos are important in determining image properties. Both lead to an asymmetry between the image properties on the positive and negative parity sides of the cluster that is more pronounced than in the case of microlensing. For example, on the negative parity side, subhalos with cores larger than about $50\,$pc do not generate any images with magnification above $\sim 100$ outside of the immediate vicinity of the cluster critical curve. We discuss these factors using analytical and numerical analysis, and exploit them to identify observable signatures of subhalos: subhalos create pixel-to-pixel flux variations of $\gtrsim 0.1$ magnitudes, on the positive parity side of clusters. These pixels tend to cluster around (otherwise invisible) subhalos. Unlike in the case of microlensing, signatures of subhalo lensing can be found up to $1''$ away from the critical curves of massive clusters.

2023-04-12, **Self-resonant Dark Matter**, Hyun Min Lee et.al., [2304.05942v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05942v1)

 We present a review on the self-resonant dark matter scenarios where multiple components of dark matter give rise to a resonant condition in the $u$-channel diagrams for their comparable masses. In this case, there is no need of lighter mediators for enhancing the self-scattering and annihilation cross sections for dark matter. We discuss the velocity-dependent self-scattering for the small-scale problems, the relic density of self-resonant dark matter, and the observable signatures in indirect and detection experiments.

2023-04-12, **Impact of dark matter spikes on the merger rates of Primordial Black Holes**, Pratibha Jangra et.al., [2304.05892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05892v1)

 Mergers of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may contribute to the gravitational wave mergers detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. We study the dynamics of PBH binaries dressed with dark matter (DM) spikes, for PBHs with extended mass functions. We analyze the impact of DM spikes on the orbital parameters of the PBH binaries formed in the early Universe and calculate their merger rates at the age of the Universe today. We consider two possible scenarios for the dynamics of the dressed binaries: assuming that either the DM spikes are completely evaporated from the binaries before merger or they remain static until the merger. Contrary to previous studies, we find that the presence of spikes may increase or decrease the present-day PBH merger rates, in some cases dramatically. Comparing with merger rates reported by the LVK Collaboration in the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3), we derive approximate constraints on the fraction of Solar-mass PBHs in cold dark matter as $f\_\mathrm{pbh}\leq \mathcal{O}(10^{-5} - 10^{-3})$, depending on the mass function. Our calculations are valid only for the idealized scenarios in which the DM spikes are either evaporated or static. However, they suggest that the impact of DM spikes on PBH merger rates may be more complicated than previously thought and motivate the development of a more general description of the merger dynamics, including feedback of the DM spikes in highly eccentric PBH binaries.

2023-04-12, **Lensing with generalized symmetrons**, Christian Käding et.al., [2304.05875v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05875v1)

 Generalized symmetrons are models that have qualitatively similar features to the archetypal symmetron, but have barely been studied. In this article, we investigate for what parameter values the fifth forces induced by disformally coupling generalized symmetrons can provide an explanation for the difference between baryonic and lens masses of galaxies. While it is known that the standard symmetron struggles with providing an alternative source for the lensing otherwise attributed to particle dark matter, we show that some generalized symmetron models are more suitable for complying with existing constraints on disformal couplings. This motivates future studies of these only little explored models.

2023-04-12, **Detecting axion dark matter with Rydberg atoms via induced electric dipole transitions**, Georg Engelhardt et.al., [2304.05863v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05863v1)

 Long-standing efforts to detect axions are driven by two compelling prospects, naturally accounting for the absence of charge-conjugation and parity symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics, and for the elusive dark matter at ultralight mass scale. Many experiments use the axion-photon coupling to probe the magnetic-field-mediated conversion of axions to photons. Here, we show that axion matter in a magnetic field induces electric dipole transitions in atoms and molecules. When applied to Rydberg atoms, which feature particularly large transition dipole elements, this effect promises an outstanding sensitivity for detecting ultralight dark matter. Our estimates show that it outperforms current experiments and other theoretical approaches based on axion-photon conversion by several orders of magnitude. The Rydberg atomic gases offer a flexible and inexpensive experimental platform that can operate at room temperature. We project the sensitivity by quantizing the axion-modified Maxwell equations to accurately describe atoms and molecules as quantum sensors wherever axion dark matter is present.

 Recently, the $\mu$-deformation-based approach to modeling dark matter, which exploits $\mu$-deformed thermodynamics, was extended to the study of galaxy halo density profile and of the rotation curves of a number of (dwarf or low brightness) galaxies. For that goal, $\mu$-deformed analogs of the Lane--Emden equation (LEE) have been proposed, and their solutions describing density profiles obtained. There are two seemingly different versions of $\mu$-deformed LEE which possess the same solution, and so we deal with their equivalence. From the latter property we derive new, rather unusual, $\mu$-deformed Heisenberg algebra (HA) for the position and momentum operators, and present the $\mu$-HA in few possible forms (each one at $\mu\to0$ recovers usual HA). The generalized uncertainty relation linked with the new $\mu$-HA is studied, along with its interesting implications including the appearance of the quadruple of both maximal and minimal lengths and momenta.

2023-04-12, **Fuzzy dark matter confronts rotation curves of nearby dwarf irregular galaxies**, Andrés Bañares-Hernández et.al., [2304.05793v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05793v1)

 We investigate phenomenologically the viability of fuzzy dark matter (FDM). We do this by confronting the predictions of the model, in particular the formation of a solitonic core at the centre of dark matter haloes, with a homogeneous and robust sample of high-resolution rotation curves from the ``LITTLE THINGS in 3D'' catalog. This comprises a collection of isolated, dark matter dominated dwarf-irregular galaxies that provides an optimal benchmark for cosmological studies. We use a statistical framework based on Markov-Chain Monte Carlo techniques that allows us to extract relevant parameters such as the axion mass, the mass of the solitonic core, the mass of the dark matter halo and its concentration parameter with a rather loose set of priors except for the implementation of a core-halo relation that is predicted by simulations. The results of the fits are used to perform various diagnostics on the predictions of the model. FDM provides an excellent fit to the rotation curves of the ``LITTLE THINGS in 3D'' catalog, with axion masses determined from different galaxies clustering around $m\_a\approx2\times10^{-23}$ eV. However we find two major problems in our analysis. First, the data follow scaling relations of the properties of the core which are not consistent with the predictions of the soliton. This problem is particularly acute in the core radius - mass relation with a tension that, at face value, has a significance $\gtrsim5\sigma$. The second problem is related to the strong suppression of the linear power spectrum that is predicted by FDM for the axion mass preferred by the data. This can be constrained very conservatively by the galaxy counts in our sample, which leads to a tension exceeding again $5\sigma$. We estimate the effects of baryons in our analysis and discuss whether they could alleviate the tensions of the model with observations.

2023-04-13, **CATS: The Hubble Constant from Standardized TRGB and Type Ia Supernova Measurements**, D. Scolnic et.al., [2304.06693v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06693v1)

 The Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) provides a luminous standard candle for constructing distance ladders to measure the Hubble constant. In practice its measurements via edge-detection response (EDR) are complicated by the apparent fuzziness of the tip and the multi-peak landscape of the EDR. As a result, it can be difficult to replicate due to a case-by-case measurement process. Previously we optimized an unsupervised algorithm, Comparative Analysis of TRGBs (CATs), to minimize the variance among multiple halo fields per host without reliance on individualized choices, achieving state-of-the-art $\sim$ $<$ 0.05 mag distance measures for optimal data. Further, we found an empirical correlation at 5$\sigma$ confidence in the GHOSTS halo survey between our measurements of the tip and their contrast ratios (ratio of stars 0.5 mag just below and above the tip), useful for standardizing the apparent tips at different host locations. Here, we apply this algorithm to an expanded sample of SN Ia hosts to standardize these to multiple fields in the geometric anchor, NGC 4258. In concert with the Pantheon$+$ SN Ia sample, this analysis produces a (baseline) result of $H\_0= 73.22 \pm 2.06$ km/s/Mpc. The largest difference in $H\_0$ between this and similar studies employing the TRGB derives from corrections for SN survey differences and local flows used in most recent SN Ia compilations but which were absent in earlier studies. SN-related differences total $\sim$ 2.0 km/s/Mpc. A smaller share, $\sim$ 1.4 km/s/Mpc, results from the inhomogeneity of the TRGB calibration across the distance ladder. We employ a grid of 108 variants around the optimal TRGB algorithm and find the median of variants is $72.94\pm1.98$ km/s/Mpc with an additional uncertainty due to algorithm choices of 0.83 km/s/Mpc. None of these TRGB variants result in $H\_0$ less than 71.6 km/s/Mpc.

2023-04-13, **The role of previous generations of stars in triggering star formation and driving gas dynamics**, Nicholas P. Herrington et.al., [2304.06659v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06659v1)

 We present hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of sub galactic regions including photoionising and supernova feedack. We aim to improve the initial conditions of our region extraction models by including an initial population of stars. We also investigate the reliability of extracting regions in simulations, and show that with a good choice of region, results are comparable with using a larger region for the duration of our simulations. Simulations of star formation on molecular cloud scales typically start with a turbulent cloud of gas, from which stars form and then undergo feedback. In reality, a typical cloud or region within a galaxy may already include, or reside near some population of stars containing massive stars undergoing feedback. We find the main role of a prior population is triggering star formation, and contributing to gas dynamics. Early time supernova from the initial population are important in triggering new star formation and driving gas motions on larger scales above 100 pc, whilst the ionising feedback contribution from the initial population has less impact, since many members of the initial population have cleared out gas around them in the prior model. In terms of overall star formation rates though, the initial population has a relatively small effect, and the feedback does not for example suppress subsequent star formation. We find that MHD has a relatively larger impact than initial conditions, reducing the star formation rate by a factor of 3 at later times.

2023-04-13, **Cosmological application of the lens-redshift probability distribution with improved galaxy-scale gravitational lensing sample**, Hui Li et.al., [2304.06529v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06529v1)

 We conduct the cosmological analysis by using the lens-redshift distribution test with updated galaxy-scale strong lensing sample, where the considered scenarios involve three typical cosmological models (i.e., $\Lambda$CDM, $\omega$CDM and $\omega\_0\omega\_a$CDM models) and three typical choices (i.e., non-evolving, power-law and exponential forms) for the velocity-dispersion distribution function (VDF) of lens galaxies. It shows that degeneracies between cosmological and VDF parameters lead to the shifts of estimates on the parameters. The limits on $\Omega\_{m0}$ from the lens-redshift distribution are consistent with those from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample at 68.3% confidence level, though the uncertainties on $\Omega\_{m0}$ from the former are about 3 to 8 times larger than those from the latter. The mean values of $\Omega\_{m0}$ shift to the larger values in the power-law VDF case and to the lower values in the exponential VDF case, compared with those obtained in the non-evolving VDF case. In the $\omega$CDM model, the limits on $\omega\_0$, i.e. the dark energy equation of state (EoS), are consistent with those from the Pantheon+ sample at 68.3% confidence level, but the mean values of $\omega\_0$ from the former are significantly smaller than those from the latter. In the $\omega\_0\omega\_a$CDM model, the uncertainties on $\omega\_0$ are dramatically enlarged compared with those obtained in the $\omega$CDM model; moreover, the Markov chains of $\omega\_a$, i.e. the time-varying slope of EoS, do not achieve convergence in the three VDF cases. Overall, the lens-redshift distribution test is more effective on constraining $\Omega\_{m0}$ than on the dark energy EoS.

2023-04-13, **Origin of neutron capture elements with the Gaia-ESO survey: the evolution of s- and r-process elements across the Milky Way**, Marta Molero et.al., [2304.06452v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06452v1)

 We study the abundance patterns and the radial gradients of s-process elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La and Ce), r-process elements (Eu) and mixed-process elements (Mo, Nd and Pr) in the Galactic thin disc by means of a detailed two-infall chemical evolution model for the Milky Way with state-of-the-art nucleosynthesis prescriptions. We consider r-process nucleosynthesis from merging neutron stars (MNS), magneto-rotational supernovae (MR-SNe) and s-process synthesis from low- and intermediate- mass stars (LIMS) and rotating massive stars. The predictions of our model are compared with data from the sixth data release of the Gaia-ESO survey, from which we consider 62 open clusters with age > 0.1 Gyr and 1300 Milky Way disc field stars. We conclude that: i) the [Eu/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] is reproduced by both a prompt and a delayed source, but the quick source completely dominates the Eu production; ii) rotation in massive stars contribute substantially to the s-process elements of the first peak, but MNS and MR-SNe are necessary in order to reproduce the observations; iii) due to the adopted yields, our model overpredicts Pr and underpredicts Nd, while the [Mo/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] is nicely reproduced. For the radial gradients, we conclude that: i) our predicted slope of the [Fe/H] gradient is in agreement with the one observed in open clusters by Gaia-ESO and other high-resolution spectroscopic surveys. ii) The predicted slope of the [Eu/H] radial gradient is steeper than the observed one, independently on how quick the production of Eu is. We discuss the possible causes of this discrepancy in terms of both different Galaxy formation scenarios and stellar radial migration effects. iii) For all the elements belonging to the second s-process peak (Ba, La, Ce) as well as for Pr, we predict a plateau at low Galactocentric distances, which is probably due to the enhanced enrichment from LIMS in the inner regions.

2023-04-13, **Far-infrared Polarization of the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A with SOFIA HAWC+**, Jeonghee Rho et.al., [2304.06291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06291v1)

 We present polarization observations of the young supernova remnant (SNR) Cas A using the High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera-Plus (HAWC+) instrument onboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The polarization map at 154 microns reveals dust grains with strong polarization fractions (5 - 30 percent), supporting previous measurements made over a smaller region of the remnant at 850 microns. The 154 microns emission and the polarization signal is coincident with a region of cold dust observed in the southeastern shell and in the unshocked central ejecta. The highly polarized far-IR emission implies the grains are large (greater than 0.14 microns) and silicate-dominated. The polarization level varies across the SNR, with an inverse correlation between the polarization degree and the intensity and smaller polarization angle dispersion for brighter SNR emission. Stronger polarization is detected between the bright structures. This may result from a higher collision rate between the gas and dust producing a lower grain alignment efficiency where the gas density is higher. We use the dust emission to provide an estimate of the magnetic field strength in Cas A using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The high polarization level is direct evidence that grains are highly elongated and strongly aligned with the magnetic field of the SNR. The dust mass from the polarized region is 0.14+-0.04 Msun, a lower limit of the amount of dust present within the ejecta of Cas A. This result strengthens the hypothesis that core-collapse SNe are an important contributor to the dust mass in high redshift galaxies.

2023-04-12, **Early-Time Ultraviolet and Optical Hubble Space Telescope Spectroscopy of the Type II Supernova 2022wsp**, Sergiy S. Vasylyev et.al., [2304.06147v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06147v1)

 We report early-time ultraviolet (UV) and optical spectroscopy of the young, nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2022wsp obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/STIS at about 10 and 20 days after the explosion. The SN 2022wsp UV spectra are compared to those of other well-observed Type II/IIP SNe, including the recently studied Type IIP SN 2021yja. Both SNe exhibit rapid cooling and similar evolution during early phases, indicating a common behavior among SNe II. Radiative-transfer modeling of the spectra of SN 2022wsp with the TARDIS code indicates a steep radial density profile in the outer layer of the ejecta, a supersolar metallicity, and a relatively high total extinction of E(B-V) = 0.35 mag. The early-time evolution of the photospheric velocity and temperature derived from the modeling agree with the behavior observed from other previously studied cases. The strong suppression of hydrogen Balmer lines in the spectra suggests interaction with a pre-existing circumstellar environment could be occurring at early times. In the SN 2022wsp spectra, the absorption component of the Mg II P Cygni profile displays a double-trough feature on day +10 that disappears by day +20. The shape is well reproduced by the model without fine-tuning the parameters, suggesting that the secondary blueward dip is a metal transition that originates in the SN ejecta.

2023-04-12, **UM 462, a local Green Pea galaxy analog under the MUSE magnifying glass**, Ana Monreal-Ibero et.al., [2304.06096v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06096v1)

 [ABRIGED] Stellar feedback in high-redshift galaxies plays an important role in the re-ionization epoch of the Universe. Green Pea galaxies (GPs) postulate as favorite local laboratories. However, at their typical redshift of $z\sim0.2$, the most intimate interaction between stars and surrounding ISM cannot be disentangled. Detailed studies of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs) are necessary to anchor our investigations on them. We present here a study in detail UM 462, a BCD with similar properties to GPs uisng high quality optical IFS data with MUSE. Total oxygen abundance by means of the direct method is 12+$\log$(O/H)$\sim$8.02 and homogenous all over the galaxy, in stark contrast with the metallicities derived from several strong line methods. The velocity field for the ionised gas presents a velocity stratification in the area towards the north with redder velocities in the high ionisation lines and bluer velocities in the low ionisation lines. This is the only area with velocity dispersions clearly above the MUSE instrumental width, and it is surrounded by two $\sim$1 kpc-long structures nicknamed \emph{the horns}. We interpret the observational evidence in that area as a fragmented super-bubble fruit of the stellar feedback and it may constitute a preferred channel for LyC photons from the youngest generation of stars to escape. The most recent SF seems to propagate from the outer to the inner parts of the galaxy, and then from east to west. We identified a supernova remnant and Wolf-Rayet stars - as traced by the red bump - that support this picture. The direction of the propagation implies the presence of younger Wolf-Rayet stars at the maximum in H$\alpha$. The ensemble of results exemplifies the potential of 2D detailed spectroscopic studies of dwarf star-forming galaxies at high spatial resolution as key reference for similar studies on primeval galaxies.

2023-04-12, **Accretion process of a black hole in scalar field dark energy model**, M. Koussour et.al., [2304.05807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05807v1)

 We propose a logarithmic parametrization form of energy density for the scalar field dark energy in the framework of the standard theory of gravity, which supports the necessary transition from the decelerated to the accelerated periods of the Universe. The analyzed model has a parameter space that is constrained by available observational data, including cosmic chronometers data-sets (CC), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data-sets, and Supernovae (SN) data-sets, consisting of only two parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The combined $CC$+$BAO$+$SN$ data-sets yields a transition redshift of $z\_{tr}=0.79^{+0.02}\_{-0.02}$, where the model exhibits signature-flipping and is consistent with recent observations. For the combined data-sets, the present value of the deceleration parameter is calculated to be $q\_{0}=-0.43^{+0.06}\_{-0.06}$. Furthermore, the analysis yields constraints on both the parameter density value for matter and the present value of the Hubble parameter, with values of $\Omega\_{m0}=0.25849^{+0.00026}\_{-0.00025}$ and $H\_{0}=67.79\_{-0.59}^{+0.59}km/s/Mpc$, respectively, consistent with the results obtained from Planck 2018. Finally, the study investigates how the mass of a black hole evolves over time in a Universe with both matter and dark energy. It reveals that the black hole mass increases initially but stops increasing as dark energy dominates.

2023-04-12, **The neutron star to black hole mass gap in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM)**, Noam Soker et.al., [2304.05705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05705v1)

 I build a toy model in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) that incorporates both the stochastically varying angular momentum component of the material that the newly born neutron star (NS) accretes and the constant angular momentum component and show that the JJEM can account for the ~2.5-5Mo mass gap between NSs and black holes (BHs). The random component of the angular momentum results from pre-collapse core convection fluctuations that are amplified by post-collapse instabilities. The fixed angular momentum component results from pre-collapse core rotation. For slowly rotating pre-collapse cores the stochastic angular momentum fluctuations form intermittent accretion disks (or belts) around the NS with varying angular momentum axes in all directions. The intermittent accretion disk/belt launches jets in all directions that expel the core material in all directions early on, hence leaving a NS remnant. Rapidly rotating pre-collapse cores form an accretion disk with angular momentum axis that is about the same as the pre-collapse core rotation. The NS launches jets along this axis and hence the jets avoid the equatorial plane region. In-flowing core material continues to feed the central object from the equatorial plane increasing the NS mass to form a BH. The narrow transition from slow to rapid pre-collapse core rotation, i.e., from an efficient to inefficient jet feedback mechanism, accounts for the sparsely populated mass gap.
