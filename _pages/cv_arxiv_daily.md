2025-08-20, **A water Cherenkov detector prototype for future high-energy tau-neutrino experiment**, Monong Yu et.al., [2508.14743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14743v1)

 The detection of high-energy tau neutrinos remains a critical challenge in neutrino astronomy, limited by inadequate angular resolution and sensitivity in current detectors like IceCube and KM3NeT. We present a modular water Cherenkov detector prototype optimized for tau-neutrino-induced extensive air showers (EAS) in the 1-100 PeV range, leveraging canyon terrain for natural cosmic-ray shielding. Laboratory validation demonstrates this prototype design has high detection efficiency (>99%) and timing resolution (<2 ns) on MIP particles, enabling precise tau-neutrino-induced EAS reconstruction for future study. The results establish a foundation of a low-cost, scalable neutrino observatory, advancing flavor ratio measurements and cosmic-ray origin problems.

2025-08-20, **Scrutinizing Fermionic Dark Matter in Scotogenic Model with Low Reheating Temperature**, Abhishek Roy et.al., [2508.14726v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14726v1)

 The scotogenic model provides a minimal and elegant framework that simultaneously explains neutrino masses and accommodates a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic DM in the scotogenic model, with a particular emphasis on the effects of a non-standard cosmological history characterized by a low reheating temperature. We demonstrate that entropy injection from inflaton decay can significantly dilute the DM abundance, thereby relaxing the annihilation cross section required to reproduce the observed relic density and opening new regions of viable parameter space. We further analyze the complementarity between current and future direct detection experiments and charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV) searches in probing this scenario. Our results show that next-generation direct detection experiments such as DARWIN and XLZD, together with upcoming cLFV searches (in particular the future sensitivity of $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ experiments), will be capable of testing substantial regions of the parameter space, including those associated with low reheating temperatures.

2025-08-20, **Anisotropic Neutrino Emission from Spinning, Moving, and Charged Primordial Black Holes**, Arnab Chaudhuri et.al., [2508.14510v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14510v1)

 The angular and spectral features of neutrinos emitted from primordial black holes (PBHs) carry key imprints of the black hole's fundamental properties. This work investigates the directional emission of neutrinos from Kerr-Newman PBHs undergoing Hawking evaporation, accounting for the combined effects of spin, motion, and electric charge. Rotation induces anisotropic fluxes through axisymmetric geometry and spin-dependent greybody factors, while relativistic motion leads to pronounced Doppler beaming along the direction of travel. Electric charge modifies the thermodynamic evolution and suppresses the emission of like-charged particles, altering the overall spectrum and burst duration. The resulting neutrino flux exhibits rich angular structure, energy dependence, and time profiles that vary with PBH parameters. These directional signatures enhance the prospects for detection at current and future neutrino observatories, and offer new multi-messenger probes of PBH populations in the early universe.

2025-08-20, **Once-in-a-lifetime encounter models for neutrino media II: Quasi-steady states and miscidynamic flavor evolution**, Anson Kost et.al., [2508.14331v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14331v1)

 We extended the once-in-a-lifetime encounter (OILE) model to stochastic interactions among neutrinos. As in the original OILE model, the new model reproduces the mean-field behavior of a dense neutrino gas for time $t\lesssim (\mu\gamma)^{-1}$, where $\mu$ measures the strength of the mean-field neutrino self-interaction potential and is proportional to the neutrino density, and the dimensionless "impact parameter" $\gamma$ is a measure of the change in the flavor quantum state of a neutrino during interaction with another neutrino when the wave packets of the two neutrinos overlap. As in the mean-field case, the OILE model with random neutrino velocities experiences kinetic flavor decoherence as the flavor quantum states of the neutrinos diverge from each other. Unlike the mean-field case, however, the OILE model has a "collision term" due to the quantum entanglement among neutrinos. For $\gamma\ll1$, this incoherent effect can drive the neutrinos into a quasi-steady state that is similar to the collective precession mode in a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas in the mean-field approximation. Subsequently, the collision term drives the neutrino gas adiabatically through different quasi-steady states and eventually to flavor equilibration. This process is an example of miscidynamic flavor evolution, with the mixing equilibria being the quasi-steady precession states.

2025-08-19, **Testing the dark side of neutrino oscillations with the solar neutrino fog at Dark Matter experiments**, Julia Gehrlein et.al., [2508.14166v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14166v1)

 The recent detection of the solar neutrino background at Dark Matter direct detection experiments paves the way to fully explore an important degeneracy in neutrino oscillations in the presence of new interactions, named the LMA-Dark degeneracy. This degeneracy makes it impossible to determine the neutrino mass ordering in oscillation experiments if neutrinos have new vectorial interactions with matter. As the composition of solar neutrinos at the Earth consists of all three neutrino flavors, testing the presence of new neutrino interactions in the muon and tau neutrino sector in scatterings can fully probe the LMA-Dark region for the first time. In this paper we show that current data from XENONnT and PandaX-4T does not yet exclude the LMA-Dark region with equal couplings of a new mediator to muon and tau neutrinos and quarks, and we identify the possible experimental scenarios to do so in the future. We also show that Dark Matter experiments can distinguish new interactions in the muon or tau sector only from new interactions affecting both sectors.

2025-08-19, **Implementation of the Martini-Ericson-Chanfray-Marteau RPA-based (anti)neutrino cross-section model in the GENIE neutrino event generator**, Lavinia Russo et.al., [2508.13939v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13939v1)

 We discuss the first implementation of the Martini-Ericson-Chanfray-Marteau RPA-based (anti)neutrino cross-section model for quasielastic (1p1h) and multinucleon (2p2h and 3p3h) excitations in the widely used GENIE neutrino event generator. Validation steps are presented, in particular, through direct comparisons of GENIE cross section output with original calculations performed by the authors of the model. Predictions for $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O and $^{40}$Ar are compared with some available T2K and MicroBooNE experimental measurements showing a reasonable agreement.

2025-08-19, **Offline Neutrino Filtering using a Convolutional Neural Network-Based Algorithm at the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland**, Ruben Camphyn et.al., [2508.13860v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13860v1)

 Neutrino astronomy is a vibrant field of study in astrophysics, offering unique insights into the Universe's most energetic phenomena. The combination of a low cross section and zero electromagnetic charge ensure that a neutrino retains most information about its original source while traversing the universe. On the other hand, these low cross sections, combined with a reduced flux at higher energies, make the neutrino one of the most elusive particles to detect in the standard model. The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) aims to detect sporadic neutrino interactions in the Greenlandic ice sheet by means of electromagnetic signals in the radio frequency range, induced by the produced charged secondary particles. The low incoming neutrino flux forces the detector to set a low trigger threshold, leading to the measured data being overwhelmed by thermal noise fluctuations. Hence, a sophisticated and robust filter is needed to differentiate between neutrino-like signals and noise. In this contribution we present the current work on the development of such a filter, based on a convolutional neural network architecture. The network employed uses real RNO-G data and simulated neutrino signals to categorize measured data as noise or neutrino-like events.

2025-08-19, **Froggatt-Nielsen like mechanism in the framework of Modular Symmetry for Neutrino Mass, Mixing and Leptogenesis**, Gourab Pathak et.al., [2508.13578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13578v1)

 We study a neutrino mass model with Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) like modular symmetry. The FN mechanism requires an additional gauge symmetry, $U(1)\_{FN}$, which is spontaneously broken at high energies. But in this work, we do not need an extra symmetry as modular weights play the role of the FN charges of the additional $U(1)\_{FN}$ symmetry. We have constructed a neutrino mass model using FN-like modular symmetry in the $T'$ group. This model can accommodate neutrino oscillation parameters and also address other phenomena beyond the Standard Model, such as neutrinoless double beta decay and the baryon asymmetry of the universe.

 Using Monte Carlo techniques, we calculate the bremsstrahlung spectrum that protons and electrons in the solar wind would produce when encountering dark matter (DM) particles within the solar system. We consider two types of interactions for the DM: one where a spin-1/2 neutral DM particle interacts with matter through the exchange of a lighter neutral scalar DM particle and one where a scalar neutral DM particle interacts directly with the matter particle. We consider three wavelengths: 21 cm, 3 mm, and 12 microns. In order to estimate the significance of the signal, we compare our results to experimental results from ARCADE2 and PLANCK, and consider the sensitivities of three telescopes: VLA, ALMA and KECK. We find that in order to produce an observable signal in the first scenario, the neutral fermion must have a mass comparable to the solar wind particle while the exchanged particle must have a mass typically $few\times 10^5$ smaller. The scalar direct interaction however appears beyond reach for any reasonable coupling.

2025-08-20, **Identifying Monochromatic Signals in LISA and Taiji via Spectral Split: Gravitational Waves versus Ultralight Dark Matter**, Yue-Hui Yao et.al., [2508.14655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14655v1)

 The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to explore the dark Universe. Ultralight dark matter (ULDM), an attractive candidate for dark matter, might induce monochromatic signals in gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers. However it is not clear how such signals are disentangled from the GWs emitted by galactic compact binaries. Here we initiate the investigation on the spectral split of monochromatic signals caused by detector's heliocentric motion in space and show the annual modulation can induce distinct structures in the spectral harmonics for GWs and ULDM, which would enable to clearly identify the nature of the signal. We show the physical parameters can be inferred with high precision using the Fisher matrix formalism. Our results provide a practical algorithm for probing ULDM and broaden the scientific objectives of future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.

2025-08-20, **Origins and lifetimes of secular and tidal bars in simulated disc galaxies**, Matthew Frosst et.al., [2508.14626v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14626v1)

 We investigate the formation of stellar bars in 307 Milky Way-mass disc galaxies in the TNG50 cosmological simulation. Most bars form rapidly in dynamically cold discs shortly after the central stellar mass exceeds that of dark matter. In these cases, bar formation is consistent with secular instabilities driven by the disc's self-gravity, which organises stellar orbits into a coherent bar structure. However, around 25 per cent of barred galaxies are dark matter dominated at the time of bar formation, $t\_{bar}$, and remain so thereafter. We trace the origin of these bars to tidal perturbations induced by passing satellites or mergers using a new metric, $S\_{bar}$, quantifying the tidal field acting on the galaxy. At the time of bar formation, we find a negative correlation between $S\_{bar}$ and the central stellar-to-dark matter mass fraction, indicating that more dark matter-dominated discs require stronger tides to trigger bar formation. These tidally induced bars are more likely to be transient than those that form secularly, although bar properties are otherwise similar. However, the host galaxies differ: secular bars arise in relatively compact discs, while tidal bars appear in extended discs whose properties resemble those of unbarred galaxies. Tidal perturbations can therefore induce bars in galaxies otherwise stable to secular formation, highlighting the dual role of the internal galactic structure and the external environment in bar formation.

2025-08-20, **The revolution in strong lensing discoveries from Euclid**, Natalie E. P. Lines et.al., [2508.14624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14624v1)

 Strong gravitational lensing offers a powerful and direct probe of dark matter, galaxy evolution and cosmology, yet strong lenses are rare: only 1 in roughly 10,000 massive galaxies can lens a background source into multiple images. The European Space Agency's Euclid telescope, with its unique combination of high-resolution imaging and wide-area sky coverage, is set to transform this field. In its first quick data release, covering just 0.45% of the full survey area, around 500 high-quality strong lens candidates have been identified using a synergy of machine learning, citizen science and expert visual inspection. This dataset includes exotic systems such as compound lenses and edge-on disk lenses, demonstrating Euclid's capacity to probe the lens parameter space. The machine learning models developed to discover strong lenses in Euclid data are able to find lenses with high purity rates, confirming that the mission's forecast of discovering over 100,000 strong lenses is achievable during its 6-year mission. This will increase the number of known strong lenses by two orders of magnitude, transforming the science that can be done with strong lensing.

2025-08-20, **Axion Star Bosenova in Axion Miniclusters**, Zihang Wang et.al., [2508.14535v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14535v1)

 Axionic dark matter can form structures known as miniclusters that host an axion star at their center. The axion star feeds on the host, and the axion star mass may grow beyond its stability limit, leading to a potential bosenova. Since a dilute axion star has a stable mass limit only when self-interaction is considered, we include axion self-interaction effects in this paper, and specify the condition for bosenova in the QCD axion and temperature-independent axion-like particle parameter spaces. We find that self-interaction may dominate the mass growth of the axion star. For a minicluster with a large initial overdensity, bosenova occurs in a large fraction of axion parameter space. For the QCD axion, bosenova occurs within the age of the Universe for miniclusters with an initial overdensity $\delta\gtrsim 100$.

2025-08-19, **Explaining Data Anomalies over the NMSSM Parameter Space with Deep Learning Techniques**, A. Hammad et.al., [2508.13912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13912v1)

 Motivated by recent results from particle physics analyses, we investigate the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) as a framework capable of accommodating a range of current data anomalies across low- and high-energy experiments. These include the so-called 95GeV and 650GeV excesses from Higgs studies, the Electro-Weakino excess from Supersymmetry searches, the latest $(g-2)\_\mu$ measurements as well as potential deviations from Standard Model (SM) predictions that would appear as a consequence in mono-$H$ (where $H=h\_{\rm SM}$) and -$Z$ signatures of Dark Matter. Our analysis demonstrates that viable NMSSM parameter regions exist where all these features can be accommodated at the $2\sigma$ level while remaining consistent with the most up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints. To identify such regions, we employ an efficient numerical scanning strategy assisted by deep learning techniques. We further present several benchmark points that realize these scenarios, offering promising directions for future phenomenological studies.

2025-08-19, **Discriminating scalar ultralight dark matter from quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves in LISA**, Jordan Gué et.al., [2508.13847v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13847v1)

 A scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) candidate would induce oscillatory motion of freely falling test masses via its coupling to Standard Model fields. Such oscillations would create an observable Doppler shift of light exchanged between the test masses, and in particular would be visible in space-based gravitational waves (GW) detectors, such as LISA. While this kind of detection has been proposed multiple times in the recent years, we numerically investigate if it is possible to extract a scalar ULDM signal in a space-based GW detector, and in particular how to differentiate such a signal from a GW signal. Using one year of realistic orbits for the LISA spacecrafts and Bayesian methods, we find that LISA will indeed be able to discriminate between the two signals.

2025-08-19, **The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations**, Francesco Sylos Labini et.al., [2508.13765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13765v1)

 Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial redshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.

2025-08-19, **The Milky Way is a less massive galaxy--new estimates of the Milky Way's local and global stellar masses**, Jianhui Lian et.al., [2508.13665v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13665v1)

 Stellar mass is the most fundamental property of a galaxy. While it has been robustly measured for millions of external galaxies, it remains poorly constrained for the Milky Way because of the strong selection effect from our inside perspective. In this work, we reconstruct the intrinsic vertical mass density profile in the solar neighborhood and the radial mass density profile across the entire Galaxy using data from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys, following careful correction for the selection function. The local density profile exhibits strong north-south asymmetry in the geometric thick disk regime and increases steeply toward the disk mid-plane, favoring an exponential model over the sech$^2$ model. Integrating the local vertical density profile yields a surface stellar mass density of 31.563$\pm$2.813(syst.)$\pm$0.024(stoch.)~${\rm M\_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$, of which 25.074 and 6.489~${\rm M\_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$ correspond to living stars and stellar remnants, respectively. The radial surface mass density profile {of the Milky Way} shares the same flat inner component as observed in the brightness profile. With this mass density profile {and local mass density from Gaia}, we derive a new estimate of the total stellar mass of the Milky Way of 2.607$\pm$0.353(syst.)$\pm$0.085(stoch.)${\rm \times10^{10}M\_{\odot}}$, a factor of two lower than the previous results. This discrepancy arises primarily from the inner disk profile, which was previously unavailable and extrapolated from the outer disk profile. The lower stellar mass estimate of the Milky Way significantly reduces its rarity in terms of supermassive black hole mass among external galaxies and implies a larger dark matter-to-baryon mass ratio in the inner Galaxy.

2025-08-19, **Inert dark matter in three Higgs doublet model: a blind spot narrative**, Amit Dutta Banik et.al., [2508.13583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13583v1)

 We explore the phenomenology of three Higgs doublet scenario, where the scalar potential is augmented by $\mathbb{Z}\_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}\_{2}$ symmetry making one doublet inert. Thus in effect, our model of interest is two Higgs plus inert Higgs doublet model charged under $\mathbb{Z}\_3$ ((2+I)HDM-$\mathbb{Z}\_3$) symmetry. We observe a blind spot feature for dark matter direct detection, as the tree-level dark matter-nucleon scattering cross-section vanishes depending on the mass splitting of dark sector particles. We perform a detailed analysis based on vacuum stability, unitarity, relic abundance, and direct detection results on the model. We also perform profile likelihood analysis and constrain the corresponding parameter space.

2025-08-19, **Constraints on Compact Dark Matter Population from Micro-lensing Effect of Gravitational Wave for the third-generation gravitational Wave Detector**, Xin-Yi Lin et.al., [2508.13577v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13577v1)

 Since the pioneering detection of gravitational wave (GW) from a binary black hole merger by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, GW has become a powerful tool for probing astrophysics and cosmology. If compact dark matter (DM) candidates, e.g. primordial black holes, contribute a substantial fraction of the DM component across a broad mass spectrum, their gravitational influence would imprint distinctive micro-lensing signatures on long-wavelength GW signals. In this paper, we propose a systematic method ranging from simulating micro-lensing GWs to constraining population information of compact DM, combining future third-generation ground-based GW detector, i.e. Einstein Telescope, with a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. This approach enables us to analyze micro-lensing signatures in GW events and probe the potential contribution of compact DM objects to the DM budget of universe. For a population with a power-law mass function, we demonstrate that detecting 8 micro-lensing GW events out of $10^4$ observed binary black holes would constrain the compact DM abundance to $\log\_{10}(f\_{\rm CO})=-2.76^{+0.16}\_{-0.17}$.

2025-08-19, **Complementarity between gravitational wave signatures and Higgs precision measurements of a classically conformal hidden U(1) extended Standard Model**, Victor Baules et.al., [2508.13527v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13527v1)

 We consider a classically conformal extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a hidden $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, where the $U(1)$ symmetry is radiatively broken via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. This radiative breaking then induces electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking through a negative mixed quartic coupling between the hidden sector Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet. Due to the mixed quartic coupling, the original two Higgs fields mix with a small angle $\theta$ to form two mass eigenstates, $h\_1$ (SM-like Higgs) and $h\_2$ (SM singlet-like Higgs). Setting their masses as $M\_{h\_1} > 2 M\_{h\_2}$ to allow the decay process, $h\_1 \to h\_2 h\_2$, we find a remarkable prediction of the conformal Higgs potential: the corresponding decay width is strongly suppressed in contrast to the one in the conventional Higgs potential. This anomalous behavior provides a striking experimental signature testable at the International Linear Collider (ILC) and other future high-energy lepton colliders. In this work, we investigate further experimental signatures of the model which are complementary to the Higgs physics at the colliders. First, we study the hidden $U(1)$ gauge boson as a cold dark matter (DM) candidate. While we find parameter regions consistent with both the observed relic abundance and collider sensitivities, these regions are excluded by current direct DM detection limits. Second, we consider a strong first-order phase transition associated with hidden $U(1)$ breaking in the early universe and compute the resulting gravitational wave (GW) spectrum. We find that for parameter regions complementary to Higgs precision measurements at the ILC, the predicted GW signals lie well above the projected sensitivities of future GW observatories.

2025-08-20, **Estimating Initial Mass of Gaia-Enceladus Dwarf Galaxy with Chemical Evolution Model**, Olcay Plevne et.al., [2508.14890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14890v1)

 This work investigates the initial mass and chemical evolution history of the Gaia-Enceladus dwarf galaxy. We combine spectroscopic data from APOGEE with astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to identify Gaia-Enceladus candidate stars via a machine-learning pipeline using t-SNE and HDBSCAN. By focusing on kinematic and chemical parameters, especially $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$, $\mathrm{[Al/Fe]}$, and $\mathrm{[Mn/Fe]}$, we uncover a population of metal-poor, high-eccentricity stars that align with literature criteria for Gaia-Enceladus debris. We then apply the \textit{OMEGA+} chemical evolution model, incorporating MCMC fitting of the observed abundance trends in the $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]\times[Fe/H]}$ plane. Our best-fitting model indicates a gas mass of $4.93\_{-0.72}^{+0.32}\times10^9\,{M\_{\odot}}$ for Gaia-Enceladus, placing it at the higher end of previously suggested mass ranges. The model scenario suggests a short star formation timescale, substantial outflows, and a rapid build-up of metals mainly driven by core-collapse supernovae, with a lesser contribution from Type~Ia supernovae. Comparison with observational data in other chemical planes (e.g., $\mathrm{[Mg/Mn]\times[Al/Fe]}$) supports this scenario, emphasizing a distinct evolution path relative to the Milky Way. Additionally, our results provide indirect evidence that star formation in Gaia-Enceladus likely ceased within the first 4 Gyr, consistent with earlier inferences of an early merger event. These findings highlight the power of chemical evolution modeling in reconstructing the origin and mass of ancient accreted systems. Overall, we show that Gaia-Enceladus, through a rapid star formation and strong outflows, contributed a significant fraction of the metal-poor stellar halo of the Milky Way.

 Supernovae (SNe) IIn are terminal explosions of massive stars that are surrounded by a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Among SNe IIn, a notable subset is the SNe 2009ip-like, which exhibit an initial, fainter peak attributed to stellar variability in the late evolutionary stages, followed by a brighter peak, interpreted as the SN explosion itself. We analyse the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2024hpj, a SN IIn with signs of precursor activity. Comparing it with similar objects in the literature, we identify star-forming regions as their preferred environments, while a statistical analysis on the observed rate of SNe 2009ip-like indicates progenitor masses around 25 - 31 solar masses and lower. The diversity of spectrophotometric features within the sample suggests that variations in CSM mass and distribution influence the observed characteristics, indicating a shared progenitor scenario.

2025-08-20, **MUSE Observations Reveal Optical Coronal Iron Lines from Shock Emission in Supernova Remnant 0540-69.3**, L. Tenhu et.al., [2508.14570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14570v1)

 We investigate the optical shock emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant 0540-69.3 (SNR 0540) using MUSE integral-field-unit data from the VLT. The observations cover the spectral range 4650-9300 $\r{A}$ and provide a $1\times1$ arcmin$^{2}$ field of view, encompassing nearly the entire remnant. We analyse the spatial and spectral properties of shock-related emission lines, and identify clumpy optical shock emission e.g. from [S II] $\lambda\lambda$6716,6731 doublet and the coronal [Fe XIV] $\lambda$5303 line (typically at radial velocities $\lesssim\|100\|$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim\|170\|$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively). These features trace the blast-wave shell seen in previous X-ray studies. Post-shock electron density estimates, based on the [S II]-line ratio, reveal spatial variation, with the highest densities ($\sim10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) in the bright knots in the west, and lower densities ($\sim3\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$) in the east. The density in the north (southwest) appears significantly lower (higher) but remains unconstrained due to limited signal. We also estimate blast-wave shock velocities using the [Fe XIV] $\lambda$5303/[Fe XI] $\lambda$7892 ratio, finding low velocities ($\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$), consistent with previous studies. All these results support the scenario that the blast wave is interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium, particularly in the western regions. Additionally, we detect four unidentified emission lines, $\sim$2000-3000 km s$^{-1}$ south from the pulsar in transverse velocity, but their origin remains unclear. Possible explanations, including Fe lines from a high-velocity ejecta clump, all present challenges. Our findings highlight the complex nature of the circum- and interstellar medium surrounding SNR 0540.

2025-08-20, **High-resolution Radio Study of Pulsar Wind Nebula MSH 15-52 and Supernova Remnant RCW 89**, S. Zhang et.al., [2508.14476v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14476v1)

 We present high-resolution radio observations of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) MSH15-52, which is renowned for its distinctive hand-like shape, and its associated supernova remnant RCW 89. Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we obtained 3 and 6,cm radio maps with a resolution of 2 arcsec. These unveil small-scale radio features in the system and allow a direct comparison with the arcsecond-resolution X-ray images. We find that the radio emission is composed of a complex filamentary structure. In particular, there is a bar-like feature across the central pulsar B1509-58 in the inner PWN, and the radio sheath wrapping around the pulsar also appears to be made up of filaments. Some prominent X-ray features are not detected in radio, including the one-sided jet in the south and the finger-like structures in the north. These indicates turn over of the particle distribution at low energies in these regions. For RCW 89, the radio emission well coincides with both the X-ray knots and the H{\alpha} filaments. The high polarization fraction shows that the emission is synchrotron in nature, but it extends well beyond the sharp boundary of the non-thermal X-ray emission, which is difficult to explain.

2025-08-20, **Reconstruction of X-Ray Afterglow Light Curves of GRBs and its implication for constraining Cosmological Parameters**, Yu-Qi Zhou et.al., [2508.14467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14467v1)

 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as important cosmological probes, whose X-ray afterglow light curves (LCs) may exhibit a plateau phase (with temporal slope $\alpha$ between 0 and 0.5) that may originate from magnetar energy injection. Similar to Type Ia Supernovae, GRBs with a common physical origin can be used as standardizable candles for cosmological studies. However, observational gaps in GRB light curves introduce significant uncertainties in plateau parameter estimation, thereby affecting cosmological constraints. In this work, we employ a stochastic reconstruction technique to reconstruct the X-ray afterglow LCs for 35 GRB samples exhibiting plateau features, generating 50 simulated data points for each LC. Using the reconstructed LCs, we calibrate three luminosity correlations: the $L\_0$-$t\_b$, $L\_0$-$t\_b$-$E\_{p,i}$, and $L\_0$-$t\_b$-$E\_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso}}$ relation, which are then applied to constrain both flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models. The main results include: (i) the $L\_0$-$t\_b$ relation yields a slope $b \approx -1$, supporting a constant magnetar energy injection rate; (ii) light curve reconstruction has limited impact on cosmological parameter constraints; (iii) for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L\_0$-$t\_b$-$E\_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\Omega\_m$ improves by 6.25\%; For the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L\_0$-$t\_b$-$E\_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\Omega\_\Lambda$ improves by 1.01\%. Our findings suggest that increasing the number of LC data points provides limited improvement to cosmological constraints, while expanding the sample size of GRBs with identical physical origins may be more crucial.

 Envelope stripping, whether through single-star wind mass loss or binary mass transfer, is a key evolutionary pathway for the formation of classical Wolf-Rayet stars and lower-mass stripped helium (He) stars. However, to study the evolution of these objects into black holes, neutron stars, and stripped-envelope supernovae, we need appropriate input models for the core-He burning phase without relying on the uncertain evolution into this evolved phase. Reliable mass-luminosity relations (MLRs) for He stars are needed for stellar wind and evolution studies, but the MLRs currently in literature are either for fully-stripped or chemically homogeneous stars, neither of which reflect the important and recently also observationally confirmed stage of partial stripping. We alleviate this drawback by computing sets of MESA synthetic structure models with partially-stripped chemical profiles, consisting of a pure-He core and a hydrogen (H)-depleted envelope with an H/He chemical gradient left behind from the receding convective core during the main sequence. As the H slope increases from 0 (full chemical homogeneity) to $\infty$ (pure-He stars) in our synthetic models, we find the luminosity to initially increase before eventually decreasing. The maximum luminosity for a given mass is reached for an intermediate H-profile slope corresponding to a partially-stripped structure, exceeding even the values documented for pure-He stars, primarily due to the H shell disproportionately dominating the total luminosity budget. We also provide convenient mass-luminosity fit relations to predict the minimum, maximum, and pure-He luminosities for a given mass -- and vice versa -- while accounting for structures achievable through partial stripping. We also explore the impact of the higher luminosity on the wind properties of partially-stripped configurations using hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere models.

2025-08-19, **Is Phantom Barrier Crossing Inevitable? A Cosmographic Analysis**, Nandan Roy et.al., [2508.13740v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13740v1)

 We investigate the evolution of dark energy using a model-independent framework based on the cosmographic approach. The main objective of this work is to construct a dynamical dark energy model directly from the kinematic equations of the cosmographic parameters, rather than adopting any arbitrary parametrization of the cosmological parameters. We employ the differential equation for the jerk parameter and map it to an anharmonic oscillator equation. From this, we derive an analytical expression for the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy. Interestingly, this form of the EoS depends on only a single parameter. Using the recently released DESI DR2 BAO data, Pantheon+ supernova dataset, and a compressed Planck likelihood, we constrain the cosmological parameters within this framework. Our results indicate a deviation from the cosmological constant behavior at late times, suggesting a dynamical nature of dark energy. Our findings contradict the DESI DR2 analysis based on the CPL parametrization, as no phantom-barrier crossing is observed in our analysis. This study highlights that model-independent reconstructions rooted in kinematical quantities can provide robust insights into the true nature of dark energy.
