2026-02-03, **Deep-Learning Denoising of Radio Observations for Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic-Ray Detection**, Zhisen Lai et.al., [2602.03818v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03818v1)

 Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) can be detected via the broadband radio pulses produced by their extensive air showers. The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a planned radio observatory that aims to deploy autonomous antenna arrays over areas of order $\sim 10^5\,\mathrm{km}^2$ to detect this emission. However, Galactic and instrumental radio backgrounds make the identification of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) pulses a central challenge. Here, we present a deep convolutional denoiser model that jointly processes each GRAND antenna trace in the time and frequency domains, allowing the network to learn transient pulse morphology and broadband spectral features while suppressing background noise. By training the model on $4.1\times 10^5$ simulated traces that include detailed UHECR radio emission and realistic detector response and noise, we find a median output-SNR improvement of $\sim 15-23\,\mathrm{dB}$ in the $50-200~\mathrm{MHz}$ band and a reduction of the normalized mean squared error of the waveform by about an order of magnitude relative to a Hilbert-envelope denoiser baseline. We also verify that applying the denoiser to noise-only windows does not produce spurious pulse candidates. Near the detection threshold, the denoiser increases the number of antennas contributing reliable pulse timing by a factor of $\sim 2-3$, which correspondingly tightens direction reconstruction uncertainties. When we additionally require accurate recovery of the waveform shape, the denoiser yields a median gain of $\sim 3-4$ antennas usable for energy reconstruction at SNR$\simeq 5-6$, strengthening event-level direction and energy estimates in sparse radio arrays.

2026-02-03, **Quantum speed limit time for bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations in matter with non-standard interactions**, Abhishek Kumar Jha et.al., [2602.03748v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03748v1)

 In the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework, we investigate the transition probabilities of an initial muon neutrino flavor state in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSIs) characterized by complex off-diagonal ($\|ε\_{αβ}\|e^{iφ\_{αβ}}$) and diagonal parameters ($\|ε\_{αα}-ε\_{ββ}\|$), including a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, under both normal (NO) and inverted mass ordering (IO) scenarios. Within these scenarios and through the lens of mode entanglement, bipartite entanglement measures such as entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement are quantified in terms of the transition probabilities, which can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments. Using these two bipartite entanglement measures, we further explore the quantum speed limit (QSL) time, which describes how rapidly bipartite entanglement evolves during neutrino oscillations. We illustrate our results using the baseline lengths and energies corresponding to ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, such as T2K, NO$ν$A, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. In the presence of a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, both with and without NSI effects, we compare the QSL time behavior for bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations for NO and IO. The most pronounced discrepancies in the QSL time for bipartite entanglement arise from the off-diagonal NSI parameter $ε\_{μτ}$ across both the NO and IO scenarios. We emphasize that among all the experiments considered, NO$ν$A and DUNE exhibit a rapid suppression of bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations in the standard oscillation scenario with NO at the end of their baseline lengths for the corresponding best-fit value of CP-violating phase. Our results hint at a possible imprint of new physics in neutrino oscillations.

2026-02-03, **Asymmetric dark matter from leptogenesis in type-III seesaw framework with modular $S_4$ symmetry**, Abhishek et.al., [2602.03384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03384v1)

 We present a unified framework for neutrino masses, baryogenesis, and dark matter based on a modular $S\_4$ symmetry combined with a type-III seesaw mechanism. All Yukawa couplings, CP phases, and flavor textures originate from a single complex modulus $τ$, whose vacuum expectation value controls both visible and dark sector dynamics. The same modular parameter fixes the neutrino mass matrix, determines the CP asymmetries driving resonant leptogenesis, and correlates the resulting baryon and dark matter abundances. A detailed numerical analysis shows that the model reproduces all neutrino oscillation data within the $3σ$ NuFIT~5.2 (2024) ranges for normal ordering, predicting $δ\_{\rm CP} \simeq \pm (150^\circ-180^\circ)$, $\sum m\_ν\simeq(0.06-0.08)~\mathrm{eV}$, and an effective Majorana mass $m\_{ββ} \simeq (8 - 18)\times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{eV}$, testable in next-generation neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. The same modular Yukawas yield resonantly enhanced CP asymmetries $\|ε\_{L,χ}\| \sim 10^{-9}-10^{-6}$ at $M\_Σ\sim 10^{7}~\mathrm{GeV}$, successfully generating the observed baryon asymmetry $η\_B\simeq6\times10^{-10}$ and dark relic density $Ω\_χh^2\simeq0.12$ without additional free parameters. The predicted correlation $Ω\_χ/Ω\_B\simeq5.4$ fixes the dark matter mass to $m\_χ\simeq0.1-2~\mathrm{GeV}$, consistent with all current constraints. This framework therefore realizes a fully predictive baryon$-$dark matter co-genesis, where the geometry of the modular symmetry links the origin of flavor, CP violation, and the cosmic matter asymmetry.

2026-02-02, **Wave packet description of Majorana neutrino oscillations in a magnetic field**, Artem Popov et.al., [2602.02804v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02804v1)

 Majorana neutrino oscillations in a magnetic field are considered using the wave packets formalism. The modified Dirac equation for Majorana neutrinos with non-zero transition magnetic moments propagating in a magnetic field is solved analytically in the two flavour case. The expressions for the oscillations probabilities are derived accounting for the decoherence effect emerging at distances exceeding the coherence length. It is shown that for Majorana neutrinos propagating in a magnetic field the coherence length coincides with the coherence length for neutrino oscillations in vacuum when the vacuum frequency is much greater than the magnetic frequency ($ω\_{vac} \gg ω\_B$), while it is proportional to the cube of the average neutrino momentum if ($ω\_{vac} \ll ω\_B$). We show that the decoherence effect may appear during neutrino propagation in a magnetic field of supernova.

2026-02-02, **Differentiating Dimension-6 and Dimension-8 Effects in $ν$SMEFT at the HL-LHC**, Manimala Mitra et.al., [2602.02720v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02720v1)

 We study dimension-eight effects in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory extended by right-handed neutrinos ($ν$SMEFT). Using the Hilbert series formalism, we derive the complete basis of dimension-eight operators and confirm agreement with existing classifications, providing a systematic framework beyond the conventional dimension-six truncation. We analyse the collider phenomenology of the representative operator $\mathcal{O}\_{N^{2}q^{2}B}^{(1,2)}$ at the High-Luminosity LHC. The resulting signatures involve pair production of right-handed neutrinos in association with jets, followed by decays into electron-jet final states with potentially displaced vertices. Since similar final states are generated by leading dimension-six operators, we explicitly address whether dimension-eight contributions can be experimentally distinguished from dimension-six effects. Using a Boosted Decision Tree analysis based on kinematic observables, we show that the dimension-eight signal can be reliably separated from each relevant dimension-six hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that dimension-eight operators in the $ν$SMEFT can give rise to experimentally resolvable signatures and should be included in collider EFT interpretations.

2026-02-02, **Generalized Neutrino Interactions: constraints and parametrizations**, L. J. Flore et.al., [2602.02688v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02688v1)

 Generalized neutrino interactions (GNI) are emerging as a convenient framework for describing effective scalar, vector, and tensor interactions. Such interactions arise naturally from extensions of the Standard Model that aim to explain neutrino properties and their mass origin. In this paper, we carefully study the two more common parametrizations for GNI and how to relate them. This allows us to compare bounds obtained from CEvNS and deep-inelastic scattering under the same footing. In addition, we present the current bounds from CEvNS measurements by COHERENT and compare them to those obtained from deep inelastic scattering on the same level. Our results focus on neutrino-quark interactions, and illustrate the complementarity between experiments working at different scales for GNI, showing that scalar interactions are better constrained by low-energy experiments like COHERENT, while tensor interactions are robustly constrained from deep inelastic scattering.

2026-02-02, **The ubiquitous flavor pendulum**, Damiano F. G. Fiorillo et.al., [2602.02655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02655v1)

 A system of classical interacting spins can develop collective instabilities which, in the nonlinear regime, mimic the motion of a gyroscopic pendulum. Known as the flavor pendulum, this behavior appears among the collective modes of a dense neutrino plasma after a strong reduction of phase space through symmetry assumptions. It has been identified in homogeneous slow and fast flavor systems and, most recently, in single-wave solutions of the fast system. We explain the reasons for its ubiquitous appearance. We show that a system of three classical spins must always be pendular, or only two in the presence of an external field. Furthermore, such a system always defines a continuum of vectors with time-independent length. If these are identified as interacting spins, they immediately lead to the continuum cases of slow and fast flavor pendula. As another new insight, any of these spins can be chosen as the pendulum, periodically exchanging flavor with the rest of the system.

2026-02-02, **Gravitational-Wave Signals for Supernova Explosions of Three-Dimensional Progenitors**, Alessandro Lella et.al., [2602.02651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02651v1)

 Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are sources of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by hydrodynamical instabilities and highly time-dependent anisotropies of the neutrino radiation. In this work we analyze both contributions to the GW signal for two state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) SN models computed with the Prometheus-Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code. In contrast to the far majority of models analyzed for GWs so far, our core-collapse simulations were started with 12.28 M\_sun (18.88 M\_sun) progenitors, whose final hour (7 min) of convective oxygen-shell burning was computed in 3D and featured a vigorous oxygen-neon shell merger. The corresponding large-scale asymmetries in the oxygen layer are conducive to buoyancy-aided neutrino-driven explosions. The models were continuously evolved in 3D from the pre-collapse evolution until 5.11 s (1.68 s) after the core bounce. The GW signals result from the well-known dynamical phenomena in the SN core such as prompt postshock convection, neutrino-driven convection, the standing accretion shock instability, proto-neutron star oscillations, and anisotropic ejecta expansion. They do not exhibit any new or specific features that can be unambiguously connected to the powerful pre-collapse activity in the progenitors, but we identify interesting differences compared to results in the literature. We also discuss measurement prospects by interferometers, confirming that GW signals from future Galactic SNe will be detectable with existing and next-generation experiments working in the frequency range f ~ 1-2000 Hz.

2026-02-02, **Evaluating the Contribution of Active Galactic Nuclei to the Diffuse High-Energy Neutrino Flux**, Samyak Jain et.al., [2602.02390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02390v1)

 The detection of high-energy neutrinos from NGC 1068 and TXS-0506+56 suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGN) may contribute significantly to the the diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube. Using 10 years of publicly available IceCube data, we performed a systematic population analysis of X-ray-bright and gamma-ray-bright AGN to evaluate the extent to which this diffuse flux could originate from these sources. We find that gamma-ray-bright blazars can account for no more than 16\% of IceCube's total diffuse flux. Although we find no evidence of neutrino emission from gamma-ray-bright, non-blazar AGN, we cannot exclude the possibility that these sources contribute significantly to the diffuse flux. In contrast, we report (pre-trials) evidence of neutrino emission from several nearby, X-ray-bright, Seyfert-type AGN, including \mbox{NGC 1068} ($4.9σ$), SWIFT J1041.4-1740 ($2.6σ$), SWIFT J0202.4+6824A/B ($2.6σ$), SWIFT J0744.0+2914 (2.6$σ$), NGC 4151 ($2.5σ$), and NGC 3079 ($2.5σ$). Although not fully conclusive, these results suggest that IceCube may be detecting neutrinos from a larger population of Seyfert galaxies. The fact that these sources are not gamma-ray bright indicates that their neutrino production must be taking place in optically thick environments, such as in the coronae surrounding these galaxies' supermassive black holes. We also identify a $4.2σ$ correlation between the neutrinos detected by IceCube and members of the Swift-BAT catalog of X-ray-bright AGN, although this correlation is dominated by NGC 1068. We estimate that this class of sources contributes between 11.2\% and the entirety of IceCube's total diffuse neutrino flux. These results strengthen the emerging case for the prevalence of gamma-ray-obscured AGN as significant sources of high-energy neutrinos.

2026-02-02, **A Unified Framework for 10 TeV to EeV Diffuse Neutrino Sky and KM3-230213A**, Shiqi Yu et.al., [2602.02372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02372v1)

 Establishing a unified origin that simultaneously accounts for the wide-band diffuse flux and recent ultra-high-energy (UHE) detections is a pressing challenge in multi-messenger astrophysics. Successive shock regimes in shock-breakout candidates, most notably low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LL GRBs), naturally introduce distinct physical environments producing a multi-component neutrino flux extending from 10 TeV to the UHE regime. Integrating prompt and afterglow phases within a unified dynamical framework yields a self-consistent explanation for this broadband emission. In this work, we discuss this framework, building on MWL observations. We show that the prompt emission from GRB~060218-like events accounts for $\gtrsim 10\%$ of the diffuse flux at 100~TeV, while GRB~100316D-like configurations predict a distinct flux peak near $10^{-9}\rm~GeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~sr^{-1}$ at 100~PeV, providing a physical interpretation for the 220 PeV KM3-230213A event. This decoupling explains the lack of low-energy counterparts for individual UHE detections while maintaining consistency with the total diffuse neutrino flux. Ultimately, this framework identifies SBO-like LL~GRBs as a unifying origin for these phenomena, providing a physical link across a wide band from 10 TeV to EeV energies testable by next-generation observatories, including GRAND, IceCube-Gen2, and RNO-G.

2026-02-02, **Multi-Messenger Modeling of Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts**, Shiqi Yu et.al., [2602.02367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02367v1)

 Low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LL GRBs), a subclass of the most powerful transients in the Universe, remain promising sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, despite strong IceCube constraints on typical long GRBs. In this work, a novel approach is introduced to study a sample of seven LL~GRBs with their multi-wavelength observations to investigate leptohadronic processes during their prompt emission phases. The relative energy densities in magnetic fields, non-thermal electrons, and protons are constrained, with the latter defining the cosmic-ray (CR) loading factor. Our results suggest that LL~GRBs exhibit diverse emission processes, as confirmed by a machine-learning analysis of the fitted parameters. Across the seven LL~GRBs, we find the posterior medians of the CR loading factor in the range of $ξ\_p \sim 0.2$--$1.6$. GRB~060218 and GRB~100316D, the lowest-luminosity bursts ($L\_{γ, \rm iso} \sim 10^{46}$-$10^{47}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$) consistent with the shock-breakout (SBO) scenario, yield the highest CR loading factor and therefore are expected to produce neutrinos more efficiently. Our model predicts the expected number of neutrino signals that are consistent with current limits but would be detectable with next-generation neutrino observatories. These results strengthen the case for LL~GRBs as promising sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and motivate real-time searches for coincident LL~GRB and neutrino events. Next-generation X-ray and MeV facilities will be critical for identifying more LL~GRBs and strengthening their role in multi-messenger astrophysics.

2026-02-02, **Pseudo-Goldstone Neutrinos and Majoron Phenomenology from Spontaneous $U(1){Lμ-L_τ}$ Breaking**, Gayatri Ghosh et.al., [2602.02362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02362v1)

 We present a predictive framework for neutrino mass generation based on the spontaneous breaking of a leptonic $U(1)\_{L\_μ-L\_τ}$ symmetry within a supersymmetric setting. The breaking of the global symmetry gives rise to a Majoron-like axion-like particle and a pseudo-Goldstone right-handed neutrino whose mass is naturally suppressed by supersymmetry-breaking effects. The interplay between the pseudo-Goldstone neutrino and the low-scale seesaw mechanism leads to a structured neutrino mass matrix capable of reproducing the observed neutrino masses, mixing angles, and CP-violating phase without invoking extreme parameter hierarchies.   We perform a numerical fit to current neutrino oscillation data and identify representative benchmark solutions consistent with laboratory constraints as well as cosmological and astrophysical bounds. A characteristic outcome of the framework is the emergence of correlated relations linking the symmetry breaking scale, heavy neutrino masses, Majoron couplings, and neutrino lifetimes. Majoron-induced invisible neutrino decay arises generically and can significantly modify cosmological neutrino mass constraints for sufficiently low symmetry breaking scales.   We discuss the phenomenological implications across neutrino oscillation experiments, cosmology, and collider searches for long-lived heavy neutrinos. While a detailed experimental simulation is beyond the scope of this work, existing sensitivity projections indicate that portions of the parameter space may become accessible in future facilities. The combined interplay of laboratory probes and cosmological observations provides a consistent and testable picture of neutrino mass generation tied to spontaneous leptonic symmetry breaking and axion-like physics.

2026-02-02, **Chasing Long-Lived Doubly Charged Scalars at Future Lepton Colliders**, Nandini Das et.al., [2602.02308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02308v1)

 We come up with a novel search strategy for long-lived doubly charged scalars at future proposed lepton colliders. The doubly charged scalar studied in this work belongs to an $SU(2)\_L$ complex scalar triplet that accounts for tiny neutrino masses via the Type-II Seesaw mechanism. For scalar masses $\lesssim 200 $ GeV and appropriate values of the triplet vacuum expectation value, this state can be long-lived and decay predominantly into like-sign muon pairs (e.g. $μ^+μ^+ $ or $μ^-μ^-$), producing distinctive displaced-vertex signals. We investigate the pair production of these scalars at the International Linear Collider (ILC) and a prospective muon collider, considering their planned center-of-mass energies. Incorporating theoretical and experimental constraints, we study the resulting signature of four leptons accompanied by missing transverse energy. Displaced vertices offer direct evidence of the scalar's long lifetime, while we further show that the invariant mass distribution of same-sign dilepton pairs serves as a powerful complementary probe for discovering doubly charged Higgs bosons at both the ILC and muon collider.

2026-02-02, **Impact of Two-Body Currents on Semi-Exclusive Lepton-Nucleus Reactions**, N. Rocco et.al., [2602.02231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02231v1)

 We generalize the spectral-function formalism to describe two-nucleon knockout processes in exclusive kinematics. Significant improvements are introduced both in the treatment of the current operators entering the $Δ$-current contribution and in the modeling of correlations between the two struck nucleons, including a consistent treatment of isospin dependence and the explicit incorporation of angular correlations. The framework is validated through comparisons with relativistic Fermi-gas calculations and with semi-exclusive electron-nucleus scattering data. Our results demonstrate that an accurate description of nuclear dynamics plays a crucial role in modeling this reaction mechanism. We further present a study of selected electroweak observables relevant to neutrino-scattering experiments.

2026-02-02, **Systematical decomposition of dimension-11 short-range neutrinoless double beta decay operators**, Shi-Yu Li et.al., [2602.02152v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02152v1)

 Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0νββ$) may receive sizable contributions from short-range physics beyond the Standard Model. We present a systematical classification of all tree-level ultraviolet completions of the dimension-11 short-range $0νββ$ decay operators, renormalizable scenarios with scalar and fermion mediators are considered. We identify eight distinct topologies and twenty-eight viable diagrams, from which all consistent UV completions are generated by imposing Standard Model gauge invariance. All these models involve a total of 61 new fields beyond the Standard Model and they typically feature fractionally charged fermions and exotic bosons such as dileptons, diquarks, and leptoquarks. We further study a representative model without colored mediators and analyze its implications for the $0νββ$ decay half-life and light neutrino masses. We find that current and future $0νββ$ decay experiments impose stringent constraints. Our systematic decomposition provides a general framework for exploring exotic short-range contributions to $0νββ$ decay in future experiments.

2026-02-02, **Astro-COLIBRI: An Innovative Platform for Real-Time Multi-Messenger Astrophysics**, Bernardo Cornejo Avila et.al., [2602.02058v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02058v1)

 The discovery of transient phenomena, such as supernovae, novae, Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and stellar flares, together with the emergence of new cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and Gravitational Waves (GWs), has revolutionized astrophysics in recent years. To fully exploit the scientific potential of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous detections, researchers need a tool capable of rapidly compiling and contextualizing essential information for every new event. We present Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge.   Astro-COLIBRI is a comprehensive platform that combines a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly interfaces including a website and mobile app for iOS and Android. It ingests alerts from multiple sources in real time, applies user-defined filters, and situates each event within its multi-messenger and multi-wavelength context. The platform provides clear data visualization, concise summaries of key event properties, and evaluations of observing conditions across a wide network of observatories worldwide. We here detail the architecture of Astro-COLIBRI, from the data pipelines that manage real-time alert ingestion and processing to the design of the RESTful API, which enables seamless integration with other astronomical software and services.

2026-02-02, **Revisiting neutrino-driven magnetogenesis during stellar core collapse**, Fan Zhang et.al., [2602.01659v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01659v1)

 The literature has not converged onto a precise depiction of the magnetogenesis process for pulsars, and it is profitable to preliminarily but exhaustively assess the viability of the plethora of alternative proposals, before substantial efforts are invested into simulating them in detail. In this note, we tackle one of them, taking notice of an earlier work that suggests neutrino ponderomotive force could spawn a magnetic field not so far off from pulsar strengths. We reexamine this mechanism with more modern technology, accounting for actual core collapse dynamics, and show that this mechanism is likely less powerful than originally envisioned.

2026-02-02, **Bounds on the Tsallis Parameter from a deformed Neutrino Sector in the Early Universe**, Matias P. Gonzalez et.al., [2602.01596v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01596v1)

 We generalize neutrino energy density content in the early universe near BBN era $T\simeq1$ MeV within Tsallis nonextensive statistics. By using Curado-Tsallis constraints we obtain generalized distribution functions $f\_q(E)$. We compute the generalized thermodynamic integral for the energy density $ρ\_q$. We define a reescaling $R^{(ξ= +1)}\_ρ(q) = ρ\_q/ρ^{\rm std}$ which is a ratio between the deformed energy density and the standard extensive case. The last was used to directly map and deform neutrino content via the effective number of neutrinos $N\_{\rm eff}$. The deformation prediction was confronted against CMB$+$BAO and BBN data for $N\_{\rm eff}$ by a joint/combined $χ^2$ type-fit. We obtained the constraints $\|q-1\|\le 1.09\times 10^{-2}$ (95\% CL) and $\|q-1\|\le 1.32\times 10^{-2}$ (99\% CL) from the combined analysis by numerically calculating the best value of the Tsallis parameter $q\_{\rm best}$.

2026-02-03, **Constraining cosmological simulations with peculiar velocities: a forward-modeling approach**, Aurélien Valade et.al., [2602.03699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03699v1)

 Numerical simulations are a key tool to decipher the dynamics of gravitation. Yet, they fail to spatially reproduce the Universe we observe, limiting comparison between observations and simulations to a statistical level. This is highly problematic for rare, faint or well studied nearby objects that are observed in a single environment. The computational cost of recovering this environment in random simulations is prohibitive.   We present Hamlet-PM, a method that enables the constraining of initial conditions for cosmological simulations so as to produce evolved numerical universes that can be directly compared to observations of the Local Universe: constrained simulations.   Our method implements the field-level forward modeling of the early-time density field from sparse and noisy measurements of late-time peculiar velocities. The dynamics are integrated with a particle-mesh gravity solver, thus probing the mildly non-linear regime. The code is applied to the Cosmicflows-4 compilation of peculiar velocities up to z < 0.05 (160 Mpc/h). The constrained ICs a re-simulated with a high precision N-body code.   A series of one hundred dark-matter only cosmological constrained simulations with a resolution of 512^3 particles in a 500^3 [Mpc/h]3 box is presented. Special attention is given to twelve prominent nearby galaxy clusters, whose simulated counterparts are matched on criteria of mass and separation. We provide a mass estimate constrained by the dynamical environment for each cluster.   Field-level forward modeling of the initial conditions produces highly constrained cosmological simulations. Currently, this method already overtakes in quality the pipeline in use in the peculiar-velocity community, although systematic biases still need to be addressed. Furthermore, improving the model is easy thanks to the inherent flexibility of the Bayesian approach.

2026-02-03, **Novel exact black hole solution in Dehnen $\left(1,4,\frac32\right)$ halo thermodynamics, photon circular motion and eikonal quasinormal modes**, David Senjaya et.al., [2602.03349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03349v1)

 Dehnen $(1,4,\frac32)$ dark matter halo has been proven to be a valuable model for describing the surface brightness distributions of elliptical galaxies, yet its implications for black hole spacetimes remain largely unexplored. In this work, we construct a novel exact black hole solution embedded in this Dehnen halo and investigate its physical consequences. The influence of the halo on black hole thermodynamics is analyzed through the mass function, entropy, Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, allowing us to assess both local and global thermodynamic stability of the black hole-dark matter system. Our results show that the presence of a Dehnen-type halo not only stabilizes the otherwise thermodynamically unstable Schwarzschild black hole but also induces phase transitions. In addition, we study null geodesics to examine photon motion, the shadow radius and the optical appearance of the system. The dark matter halo modifies the effective potential, leading to observable changes in the photon sphere and the apparent size of the shadow. We also explore the instability of circular null geodesics and its relation to quasinormal modes in an eikonal limit. These findings highlight the significant role of realistic dark matter distributions in shaping both the thermodynamic behavior and the observable signatures of black holes, providing further insight into the interplay between dark matter halos and central black holes in galaxies.

2026-02-03, **Line-Intensity Mapping**, Tzu-Ching Chang et.al., [2602.03011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03011v1)

 Line-Intensity Mapping (LIM) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying large-scale structure and the high-redshift universe, enabling three-dimensional maps of line emission across vast cosmological volumes. In this review, we summarize the LIM framework, its key scientific goals, and its future prospects. We describe the landscape of emission line tracers, theoretical modeling approaches, anticipated signals, and data-analysis methodologies. We also discuss experimental challenges, particularly those posed by astrophysical foregrounds, and review possible mitigation strategies. Further, we highlight a range of cross-correlation science cases, linking LIM with other cosmological surveys. Finally, we summarize current and upcoming experiments and early results, including recent first detections, while outlining the outlook for future discoveries. Specifically, LIM may offer new insights into galaxy formation and evolution and cosmology, while revealing the Epoch of Reionization, Cosmic Dawn, and possibly the Cosmic Dark Ages. LIM enables cosmological measurements that complement other probes and provide unique access to the high-redshift universe, potentially shedding light on dark matter, dark energy, and cosmic inflation.

2026-02-03, **Constraints on light dark matter from primordial black hole evaporation at dark matter direct detection experiments**, Tong Zhu et.al., [2602.03010v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03010v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are able to produce light dark matter (DM) particles via Hawking radiation, and yield a flux of boosted DM that can be probed at underground DM direct detection experiments. We analyze both galactic and extragalactic contributions to the differential flux of light DM from PBH evaporation, and then compute the expected event rate from PBH boosted DM scattering off electrons or nuclei after taking into account the attenuation effect. Using recent data from DM direct detection experiments XENONnT, PandaX-4T and LZ, we set constraints on both DM-electron and DM-nucleus scattering cross sections, as well as the fraction of DM composed of PBHs $f\_{\rm PBH}$ for $9\times10^{14}-1\times10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ PBHs that are not fully evaporated today. We also investigate the spectral evolution induced by Hawking evaporation throughout the evaporation and post-evaporation regimes. The constraints on the PBH mass are then extended into the $1\times10^{13}-6\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$ window for fully evaporated PBHs.

 We explore the sensitivity of the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) experiment to light dark matter using MeV-scale electromagnetic activity. Inelastic scattering of dark matter with argon nuclei can excite nuclear states that subsequently de-excite via the emission of MeV-scale photons, producing localized low-energy "blip" signatures in a liquid argon time projection chamber. We perform state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear calculations, including all relevant argon excited states with energies up to 18 MeV, to provide reliable predictions for these signals. After accounting for relevant backgrounds, we find that SBND can probe previously unexplored regions of parameter space for light dark matter.

2026-02-02, **Probing The Dark Matter Halo of High-redshift Quasar from Wide-Field Clustering Analysis**, Hao Meng et.al., [2602.02778v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02778v1)

 High-redshift quasars have been an excellent tracer to study the astrophysics and cosmology at early Universe. Using 216,949 high-redshift quasar candidates ($5.0 \leq z < 6.3$) selected via machine learning from the Legacy Survey Data Release 9 and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we perform wide-field clustering analysis to investigate the large-scale environment of those high-redshift quasars. We construct the projected auto correlation function of those high-redshift quasars that is weighted by its predicted probability of being a true high-redshift quasar, from which we derive the bias parameter and the typical dark matter halo mass of those quasars. The dark matter halo mass of quasars estimated from the projected auto correlation function is $\log(M\_h/M\_{\odot})=12.2 ^{+0.2}\_{-0.7}$ ($11.9^{+0.3}\_{-0.7}$), with the bias parameter $b$ of $12.34 ^{+4.26}\_{-4.37}$ ($11.52^{+4.02}\_{-4.14}$) for the redshift interval of $5.0 \leq z <5.7$ ($5.7 \leq z <6.3$). Our results, combined with other measurements of dark matter halo masses for quasars or active galactic nucleus which obtain a lower dark matter halo mass of $\sim 10^{11.5}$ M$\_\odot$ at similar redshift, suggest a more complex, and possibly non-monotonic evolution of quasar hosting dark matter halo. Moreover, we estimate the duty cycle of those quasars, which is $0.008^{+0.135}\_{-0.007}$ ($0.003+^{+0.047}\_{-0.003}$) for the redshift interval of $5.0 \leq z <5.7$ ($5.7 \leq z <6.3$).

 We propose hydrogenated carbon structures as targets with a remarkable sensitivity to dark matter-nucleon interactions, in the mass range between the 1 MeV and 100 MeV. The ejection of a proton following the interaction with a dark matter particle is a quasi-elastic process, with an extremely small energy threshold, and a clear experimental signature. The proposed detectors are simple, technologically ready, and inexpensive. Yet, they can be considerably more sensitive than current experiments. They also allow strong directionality, to be used towards efficient background rejection.

2026-02-02, **Axion-Like Electrophilic Portal for Pion Dark Matter**, Vincenzo Fiorentino et.al., [2602.02678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02678v1)

 We investigate a scenario where Strongly Interacting Massive Particle (SIMP) dark matter interacts with an axion-like particle (ALP) that couples exclusively to electrons. This minimal setup provides interactions which enforce thermal equilibrium between dark matter and the SM in the early Universe. We analyze the cosmological evolution of the dark sector and the constraints arising from dark matter annihilations, ALP laboratory searches and astrophysical observations. Our results show that the allowed parameter space is wider than previous studies and an ALP with mass $m\_a \sim {\cal O}(10)~\text{MeV}$ can act as a viable portal between the visible and dark sectors. Interestingly, this mass range overlaps with the parameter space suggested by the reported $X\_{17}$ anomaly. Furthermore, the introduction of non-vanishing $θ$ angle in the dark sector of the model opens up the parameter space to heavy ALP masses.

2026-02-02, **Probing the Charged Hayward Black Hole in Dark Matter and String Cloud Environments through Shadow, Geodesics, and Quasinormal Spectrum**, Faizuddin Ahmed et.al., [2602.02621v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02621v1)

 We construct a charged Bardeen black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) and coupled to a cloud of strings (CS). The metric function combines the magnetic monopole charge from nonlinear electrodynamics, the PFDM logarithmic correction, and the CS parameter that renders the spacetime asymptotically non-flat. We analyze the horizon structure, identifying parameter ranges yielding non-extremal BHs, extremal configurations, and naked singularities. The null geodesics, photon sphere radius, and shadow are computed, revealing that both CS and PFDM enlarge the shadow. For neutral particle dynamics, we derive the specific energy, angular momentum, and innermost stable circular orbit location. Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are examined through the azimuthal, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, where notably the azimuthal frequency is independent of the CS parameter. Scalar field perturbations governed by the Klein-Gordon equation yield an effective potential whose peak decreases with both parameters, yet the transmission and reflection probabilities respond oppositely to CS and PFDM variations. The greybody factor bounds are obtained using semi-analytical methods. Our results demonstrate that the distinct effects of $α$ and $β$ on various observables could allow independent constraints on these parameters through shadow measurements, QPO timing, and gravitational wave ringdown observations.

 The Dark matter Nanosatellite Equipped with Skipper Sensors (DarkNESS) mission is a 6U CubeSat designed to search for X-ray lines from decaying dark matter using Skipper-CCDs. Thick, fully-depleted p-channel Skipper-CCDs provide low readout noise and high quantum efficiency for 1-10 keV X-rays, but their X-ray performance has not yet been demonstrated in the space environment. DarkNESS will operate in low-Earth orbit, where trapped protons induce displacement damage in the sensor that increases charge-transfer inefficiency and degrades the X-ray energy resolution. This work measures the X-ray line response of Skipper-CCDs before and after proton irradiation and quantifies the associated degradation. A sensor was exposed to 217 MeV protons at a fluence of 8.4 x 10^10 protons cm^-2, corresponding to a displacement-damage dose more than an order of magnitude above the three-year expectation for representative mid-inclination and Sun-synchronous low-Earth orbits. A 55Fe source was used to compare the energy resolution of the beam-exposed quadrant to adjacent unexposed quadrants and a non-irradiated reference sensor. These measurements provide a quantitative assessment of radiation-induced spectral degradation in Skipper-CCDs and enable an estimate of the end-of-life X-ray energy resolution expected for DarkNESS operation in low-Earth orbit.

2026-02-02, **Reconstructing the largest scales of the Universe with field-level inference applied to the Quaia Quasar Catalogue**, Adam Andrews et.al., [2602.02363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02363v1)

 The recently released Quaia quasar catalogue, with its broad redshift range and all-sky coverage, enables unprecedented three-dimensional reconstructions of matter across cosmic time. In this work, we apply the field-level inference algorithm BORG to the Quaia catalogues to reconstruct the initial conditions and present-day matter distribution of the Universe. We employ a physics-based forward model of large-scale structure using Lagrangian perturbation theory, incorporating light-cone effects, redshift-space distortions, quasar bias, and survey selection effects. This approach enables a detailed and physically motivated inference of the three-dimensional density field and initial conditions over the entire cosmic volume considered. We analyse both the G < 20.0 (Quaia Clean) and G < 20.5 (Quaia Deep) samples, where G denotes the Gaia broad optical-band magnitude, imposing conservative sky cuts to ensure robustness against foreground contamination. The resulting reconstructions span a comoving volume of (10h^{-1} Gpc)^3 with a maximum spatial resolution of 39.1 h^{-1}Mpc, making this the largest field-level reconstruction of the observable Universe in terms of comoving volume to date. We validate our reconstructions through a range of internal and external consistency checks, including the cross-correlation of the inferred density fields with Planck CMB lensing, where we detect a signal at ~4σsignificance. Beyond delivering high-fidelity data products, including posterior maps of initial conditions, present-day dark matter, and velocity fields, this work establishes a framework for exploiting quasar surveys in field-level cosmology.

2026-02-02, **Clustering of emission line galaxies with IllustrisTNG -- II. cosmology challenge with anisotropic correlation functions and ELG-halo connections**, Ken Osato et.al., [2602.01925v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01925v1)

 Emission line galaxies (ELGs) are the primary tracers of the large-scale structures of the Universe in ongoing Stage-IV cosmological spectroscopic surveys, which aim to measure the clustering statistics at higher redshifts $z \simeq 1.5 \text{--} 2$ with unprecedented precision. In this study, we construct realistic mock ELG samples with IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations and stellar population synthesis framework. In order to validate the modelling of clustering, we measure the anisotropic correlation functions of mock ELGs and infer the linear growth rate, which is one of key cosmological parameters in galaxy clustering. As a control sample, we construct the mass-limited subhalo samples with the same number density as ELGs. The isotropic correlation functions in real space for both samples do not differ significantly. However, the quadrupole moment of the anisotropic correlation function, which is sensitive to the velocity of galaxies, is suppressed for ELGs, potentially due to the infalling motion of ELGs towards the centre of the hosting halos. The smaller amplitude leads to the underestimation of the linear growth rate and implies the velocity bias between ELGs and dark matter. When the analysis is limited to large scales $(\gtrsim 15 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc})$, the parameter bias vanishes. Next, we investigate the ELG-halo connection through the phase-space distribution of satellite ELGs within hosting halos and galactic conformity of star formation activity. The infalling motion is further confirmed by the phase-space distribution relative to the host halo, and this dynamics of ELGs challenges the assumption that the radial distribution of satellites follows that of dark matter.

2026-02-02, **Disappearing Track Signals from a Light Charged Higgs in the Alternative Left-Right Model**, Hrishikesh Deka et.al., [2602.01773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01773v1)

 We study the phenomenology of a light charged Higgs boson in the framework of the Alternative Left--Right Symmetric Model (ALRM). In this model, stringent flavor constraints are evaded due to a non-conventional fermion spectrum in which the right-handed up-type quarks are paired with the exotic down-type quarks rather than the Standard Model down-type quarks, leading to the absence of tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents. Furthermore, a specific assignment of the global $U(1)\_S$ symmetry and the resulting emergent $R$-parity prevent mixing between the right- and left-handed charged gauge bosons, $W\_R$ and $W\_L$, providing additional suppression of flavor-violating effects. The ALRM accommodates potentially viable dark matter candidates, both fermionic and scalar ones. In this context, an associated charged Higgs state, $H\_2^\pm$, belonging to the dark sector can naturally acquire a sub-TeV to TeV-scale mass without conflicting with any experimental constraints. We focus on scenarios in which $H\_2^\pm$ behaves as a long-lived particle due to a sub-GeV mass splitting with the dark matter candidate. We identify regions of parameter space consistent with the observed dark matter relic density and other experimental constraints. A detailed analysis of disappearing track signatures is performed, including realistic tracklet reconstruction efficiencies, and the existing ATLAS search are recast to assess the current limits and future sensitivities. We find that the HL-LHC has limited sensitivity to TeV-scale charged Higgs bosons in this scenario, while the 27 TeV HE-LHC can effectively probe the relevant parameter space, with a 100 TeV collider offering substantially enhanced discovery potential.

2026-02-02, **Partial Relief of the Hubble Tension and a Natural Self-Interacting Dark Matter Candidate From Staged Symmetry Breaking**, Zachary J. Hoelscher et.al., [2602.01543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01543v1)

 The values of the Hubble constant ($\rm{H\_0}$) inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and local measurements via the distance ladder exhibit a $\sim5σ$ tension. In this work we propose that the tension might be partially alleviated if a subcomponent of the dark matter undergoes decays triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking in the dark sector, so that the equation of state parameter of the subcomponent shifts from $w \approx 0$ at early times to $w \approx -1/3$ at late times. We provide an effective field theory whose structure is partially motivated by the desire for a plausible UV completion. We find that such a construction naturally produces a possible self-interacting dark matter candidate with a velocity-dependent scattering cross section as a by-product of gauge invariance. This is relevant for addressing tensions between the predictions of $Λ$CDM and observations of small-scale structure, such as the core-cusp problem.

2026-02-03, **Light-Curve and Spectral Properties of Type II Supernovae from the ATLAS survey**, K. Ertini et.al., [2602.03638v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03638v1)

 Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most common terminal stellar explosions in the Universe. With SNe now being detected within days after explosion, there is growing evidence that the majority of Type II SNe show signs of interaction with a confined, dense cirumstellar material (CSM) in the first few days post explosion. In this work we aim to bridge the gap between single SN studies showing early-time interaction in their spectra, and the statistical studies of early-time SN light curves, which imply the existence of CSM. We present a sample of 68 Type II SNe with both early photometric data, obtained with the ATLAS survey, and spectroscopic data, obtained with the ePESSTO+ collaboration. A subset of the sample is classified based on the presence or absence of narrow spectral features with electron-scattered broadened wings in the early spectra, indicative of interaction with CSM. We characterise the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the sample by measuring rise times to maximum light, peak magnitudes, decline rates and line velocities. Additionally, we measure the ratio of absorption to emission (a/e) of the H alpha P-Cygni profile. Our analysis reveals that SNe II showing early spectroscopic signs of interaction with CSM decline faster and are brighter than those without. However no difference is found in rise times between the two groups. A clear separation is observed in the a/e ratio: SNe with signs of interaction exhibit lower a/e ratios at all epochs compared to those without. Our results highlight that understanding SN II ejecta-CSM interaction requires large, uniform samples of photometric and spectroscopic data, such as the one presented in this work.

2026-02-03, **Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae: III. Supernovae and their environments**, Claudia P. Gutiérrez et.al., [2602.03599v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03599v1)

 Narrow interstellar absorption features in supernova (SN) spectra serve as valuable diagnostics for probing dust extinction and the presence of circumstellar or interstellar material. In this third paper in a series, we investigate how the strength of narrow interstellar absorption lines in low-resolution spectra varies with SN type and host galaxy properties, both on local and global scales. Using a dataset of over 10000 spectra from $\sim1800$ low-redshift SNe, we find that Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in passive galaxies exhibit significantly weaker narrow absorption features compared to CC-SNe and SNe Ia in star-forming hosts (SNe Ia-SF), suggesting lower interstellar gas content in quiescent environments. Within the star-forming hosts, the Na I D equivalent-width distribution of SNe II is much lower than that of both SNe Ia-SF and stripped-envelope SNe (SE-SNe). This result is somewhat unexpected, since CC-SNe are generally associated with star-forming regions and occur deeper within galactic disks, where stronger line-of-sight extinction would be anticipated. This suggests that the observed behaviour cannot be explained solely by absorption from the integrated interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight. Instead, if part of the absorption arises from material near the explosion, the similarity between the Na I D EW distributions of SNe Ia-SF and SE-SNe implies that comparable absorption signatures can emerge from distinct progenitor pathways. Possible explanations include (a) circumstellar material (CSM) expelled by the progenitor system before explosion, or (b) interaction of SN radiation with nearby patchy ISM clouds. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of interstellar absorption features in revealing the diverse environments and progenitor pathways of SNe.

2026-02-03, **Shells and bubbles around compact clusters of massive stars: 3D MHD simulations**, D. V. Badmaev et.al., [2602.03502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03502v1)

 We present the results of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) simulations of the plasma flow structure in the vicinity of a compact cluster of young massive stars. The cluster is considered at the evolutionary stage dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars. This stage occurs in clusters with ages of several million years, close to the onset of supernova explosions; the well-known objects Westerlund 1 and 2 are the prototypes. The collisions of powerful winds from massive stars in the cluster core, calculated as interactions of individual outflows, are accompanied by their partial thermalization and produce a collective cluster wind. The MHD dynamics of the cluster wind bubble expansion into the interstellar medium is considered, depending on the density of the surrounding medium with a uniform magnetic field. We show that when expanding into a cold neutral medium, the cluster wind is able to reshape its surrounding environment over the Wolf-Rayet star lifetime, sweeping up more than $10^4$ $M\_{\odot}$ of gas in $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ yr and producing extended, thin and dense shells with an amplified magnetic field. In a cold neutral medium with a density of $\sim 20$ cm$^{-3}$ and a magnetic field of $\sim 3.5$ $μ$G, a thin shell forms around the cluster wind bubble, characterized by a cellular structure in its density and magnetic field distributions. The cellular magnetic field structure appears in parts of the shell expanding transversely to the orientation of the external magnetic field. Magnetic fields in the shell are amplified to strengths $\gtrsim 50$ $μ$G. The formation of the cellular structure is associated with the development of instabilities. The expansion of the bubble into a warm neutral interstellar medium also leads to the formation of a shell with an amplified magnetic field.

2026-02-03, **SN 2024igg: A Super-Chandrasekhar/03fg-like SN exhibiting C II-dominated spectra after explosion**, Jialian Liu et.al., [2602.03427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03427v1)

 We present and analyze photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2024igg, another ``super-Chandrasekhar'' (or 03fg-like) SN whose strong C II $\lambda6580$ feature was initially misidentified as H$α$, thereby constraining its progenitor system, explosion parameters, and physical scenario. SN 2024igg shows many characteristics in common with other 03fg-like objects, such as high ultraviolet flux, slowly declining light curves ($Δm\_{15}(B)=0.90\pm0.08$ mag), low expansion velocities, along with strong and persistent C II absorption. Meanwhile, this SN exhibits some remarkable properties within this subgroup, including a moderately low optical luminosity ($M\_{\rm max}(B)=-18.99\pm0.15$ mag), a short rise time less than 18.5 days, and strong C II $\lambda6580$. The bolometric analysis yields a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M\_{\rm Ni}=0.547\pm0.082$ $M\_{\rm \odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $1.54^{+0.22}\_{-0.19}$ $M\_{\rm \odot}$, marginally exceeding the Chandrasekhar mass. Our TARDIS result indicates that most of the features in the earliest spectrum could be attributed to C II, which is consistent with a model where a supernova explodes within a carbon-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). The CSM interaction would produce a density peak in the ejecta, offering a natural explanation for the slowly evolving line velocities near $-$8000 km s$^{-1}$. The CSM may stem from the debris of a secondary white dwarf in a white-dwarf merger or the envelope of an asymptotic giant branch star. Combined with the unshifted forbidden lines in the spectrum taken at $t\approx\ +$135 days, we suggest that SN 2024igg comes from a symmetric explosion on a secular timescale after the merger.

2026-02-03, **Emulating galaxy and peculiar velocity clustering on non-linear scales**, T. Dumerchat et.al., [2602.03382v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03382v1)

 We explore the potential of cross-correlating galaxies and peculiar velocities on non-linear scales to enhance cosmological constraints. Leveraging the \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite and the halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism, we train emulator models to describe the non-linear clustering of galaxies and velocities in redshift space. Our analysis demonstrates that combining galaxy and peculiar velocity clustering, provides tighter constraints on both HOD and cosmological parameters, particularly on $σ\_8$ and $w\_0$. We further apply our models to realistic mock catalogues, reproducing the expected density and peculiar velocity errors of type-Ia supernovae and Tully-Fisher/fundamental plane measurements for the combined ZTF and DESI measurements. While systematic biases arise in the HOD parameters, the cosmological constraints remain unbiased, yielding $3.8\%$ precision measurement on $fσ\_8$ compared to $4.7\%$ using galaxy clustering alone. We demonstrate that, while combining tracers with realistic velocity measurements still yields improvement, the gains are diminished, highlighting the need for further efforts to reduce velocity measurement uncertainties and correct observational systematics on small scales.

2026-02-03, **Evidence for a 3.0$σ$ Deviation in Gravitational Light Deflection from General Relativity at Cosmological Scales with KiDS-Legacy and CMB Lensing**, Guo-Hong Du et.al., [2602.03110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03110v1)

 General Relativity (GR) faces challenges from cosmic acceleration and observational tensions, necessitating stringent tests at cosmological scales. In this work, we probe GR deviations via a $μ$-$Σ$ modified gravity parameterization, integrating KiDS-Legacy weak lensing (1347 deg$^2$, $z\leq 2.0$), joint CMB data (Planck/ACT/SPT), DESI DR2 BAO, and DES-Dovekie supernovae. KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $μ\_0$ (matter clustering) by $\sim 43\%$ and $Σ\_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\sim 60\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $Λ$CDM background, $μ\_0 = 0.21\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $Σ\_0 = 0.149\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$σ$ level -- attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT. This precise separation of GR-consistent matter clustering and deviant light deflection provides key observational clues for new physics or data systematics. Our work underscores the critical role of synergizing high-precision CMB and WL data in advancing GR tests.

2026-02-03, **Thurston geometries and parameter constraints from SNIa data**, Tanay Gupta et.al., [2602.02936v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02936v1)

 Following the numerous evidence for large-scale cosmic isotropy violation with the advent of the `precision cosmology' era, we explore the possible advantages of extending the flat $Λ$CDM model to more general models in order to constrain anisotropies in the universe, otherwise absent in the standard model based on FLRW spacetime. Such extensions are offered by the topologically unique Thurston geometries, which are homogeneous but anisotropic spacetime models. In this work, we attempt to distinguish Thurston geometries from one another by introducing anisotropies via different scale factors in different directions, thereby introducing additional model parameters such as shear, eccentricity, curvature, and a preferred axis. We used the latest compilation of Pantheon+ \& SH0ES Type Ia supernova data for deriving model constraints, and found mild evidence of large-scale isotropy violation.

2026-02-02, **An infrared echo from a circumstellar disk in the hydrogen- and helium-poor SN 2024aecx**, Samaporn Tinyanont et.al., [2602.02691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02691v1)

 We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of the hydrogen- and helium-poor (Type Ic) supernova (SN) 2024aecx that displays a strong NIR excess emerging 32 days post peak. SN 2024aecx is a peculiar SN Ic that exhibited luminous shock-cooling emission at early times, suggestive of close-in circumstellar medium (CSM), unexpected for this class of SNe. Its early NIR spectra are typical for a SN Ic but with strong CI absorption features. By ~32 days post peak, the spectra show a strong NIR excess, while maintaining normal optical colors, unprecedented for SNe Ic. We find that the NIR excess is well fit with a single-temperature, optically thin dust model with declining temperature, increasing mass, and roughly constant luminosity over time. The NIR excess appears too promptly for dust to have formed in the SN ejecta, indicating an IR echo from pre-existing dust in the CSM. The IR echo is likely powered by the relatively slowly evolving SN peak light, and not the brief shock cooling emission, as the latter requires unrealistically high CSM densities to explain the observed dust mass. We consider different potential CSM geometries and find that a thick face-on disk with an inner edge around $5\times 10^{16}$ cm can best explain the dust mass and temperature evolution. In this scenario, the SN shock should start interacting with this CSM $440\pm200$ days post explosion. CSM around SN Ic is rare, and follow-up observations of SN 2024aecx will probe the mass-loss process responsible for removing hydrogen and helium from their progenitor star.

2026-02-02, **Lightcurve Modelling of 2,205 ZTF DR2 Type~Ia Supernovae: Implications for SN Ia Physics and Cosmology**, Nikhil Sarin et.al., [2602.02677v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02677v1)

 We fit the multi-band light curves of 2,205 Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) from the Zwicky Transient Facility DR2 with a one-zone radioactive decay model with a phenomenological addition to include Fe recombination physics. We find a strong correlation between inferred nickel mass and SALT2 stretch, which within our simplified modelling is linked to larger ejecta masses providing longer diffusion times, providing a physical basis for the brighter-slower relation. SN~Ia in low-mass hosts ($\log\_{10}(M\_*/M\_\odot) < 10$) produce $12\%$ more $^{56}$Ni than those in high-mass hosts ($ΔM\_{\rm Ni} = 0.13~M\_\odot$), linking the host-galaxy mass step to ejecta properties and hinting at metallicity or age-dependent burning efficiencies. This suggests that standardisation based on physical parameters may remove the mass-step. SN~1991T-like events show higher ejecta masses (median $1.64~M\_\odot$ vs. $1.38~M\_\odot$ for normals) and produce $30\%$ more $^{56}$Ni, with $84\%$ having super-Chandrasekhar masses. Through Hierarchical modelling of $902$ SNe ($z \leq 0.06$), we find thermonuclear supernovae can be well described by a Gaussian distribution in ejecta mass and nickel mass with $μ\_{\rm ej} = 1.26 \pm 0.01~M\_\odot$ ($σ\_{\rm ej} = 0.33 \pm 0.01~M\_\odot$) and $μ\_{\rm Ni} = 0.64 \pm 0.06~M\_\odot$ ($σ\_{\rm Ni} = 0.42 \pm 0.02~M\_\odot$), respectively. This leads to inferred fractions of $43 \pm 2\%$ sub-$M\_{\rm Ch}$ ($<1.2~M\_\odot$), $34 \pm 1\%$ near-$M\_{\rm Ch}$ ($1.2$--$1.5~M\_\odot$), and $24 \pm 2\%$ super-$M\_{\rm Ch}$ ($>1.5~M\_\odot$) events. This work provides a step towards holistic physical characterization of the local SN~Ia population, reinforcing the physical basis of SN~Ia standardization while quantifying diversity and environmental dependencies critical for understanding progenitor physics and mitigating systematics in precision cosmology.

2026-02-02, **IRS 9: The Case for a Dynamically-Ejected Star from the Galactic Center**, Matthew Hosek et.al., [2602.02666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02666v1)

 Measuring stellar motions at the Milky Way's Galactic center (GC) provides unique insight into the dynamical processes within galactic nuclei. We present proper motion measurements for 23 SiO-maser emitting stars within 45'' of SgrA*, including four previously reported to have velocities exceeding their local escape velocities (i.e., they are "locally unbound" from the GC). Derived from 14 epochs of HST WFC3-IR observations (2010 - 2023), our measurements have a median precision of 0.038 mas/yr - up to ~100x more precise then previous constraints for some sources. By combining these proper motions with published radial velocities, we derive updated 3D velocities for the masers and find that only one is locally unbound (IRS 9; v3d = 370 +/- 1.2 km/s). Orbit integrations place the first constraints on the orbit of IRS 9, which is bound to the GC at larger radii with r\_peri >= 0.100 +/- 0.005 pc and r\_apo >= 5.25 +/- 0.18 pc. IRS 9's high velocity relative to stars at similar radii in the Nuclear Star Cluster makes it a candidate to have experienced a strong dynamical interaction in order to place it on its orbit. We explore the Hills mechanism as a possible origin, but binary evaporation and ejection velocity limits indicate that IRS 9 is unlikely to have experienced such an event in the past 0.4 Myr (the timescale constrained by the orbit integrations). Alternative mechanisms that could produce IRS 9 include binary supernova disruption, two-body interactions, and stellar collisions. Identifying additional stars like IRS 9 will be essential for understanding these various dynamical processes.

2026-02-02, **Non-Singular Bouncing cosmology from Phantom Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Coupling: Reconstruction with Observational Insights**, Khandro K. Chokyi et.al., [2602.02608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02608v1)

 We examine non-singular bounce cosmology within the framework of a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term in both non-viscous and bulk-viscous cases. Using the scale factor ansatz $α(t)=\left(\fracαη+t^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2 η}}$, we reconstruct the scalar field potential $V(t)$, and observe a smooth potential well centered at the bounce point. The resulting energy density, pressure, and equation-of-state parameter show NEC violation necessary for successful bounce, while viscosity controls post-bounce dynamics with a positive and smooth squared speed of sound. In contrast, for the non-viscous model, sharp divergences occur just at the bounce and continues to be negative in the expanding phase, which in turn emphasises the stabilising role of dissipative effects. The energy condition analysis indicates a temporary NEC and SEC violation in the viscous scenario, whereas its persistent violation within the non-viscous model suggests a continuous accelerated expansion. Observational viability is found through Bayesian MCMC fitting in regards to the Pantheon+ supernova data, with best-fit parameters providing a reduced chi-squared of $χ\_{red}^2 =0.995$ while the inflation observables derived from the reconstructed potential place our model predictions inside $68\%$ CL Planck 2018 confidence contours. Our findings suggest that bounce cosmologies could offer a physically reasonable and observationally acceptable alternative or pre-inflationary scenario, while highlighting the role that viscosity could play for a stable and smooth cosmological evolution.

2026-02-02, **DeepDive: Tracing the early quenching pathways of massive quiescent galaxies at $z>3$ from their star-formation histories and chemical abundances**, Massissilia L. Hamadouche et.al., [2602.02485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02485v1)

 We investigate the chemical abundances and star-formation histories (SFH) of ten massive ($\mathrm{log}\_{10} (M\_{\star}/\mathrm{M}\_{\odot})>10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3<z<4$ using deep, medium-resolution spectroscopic data obtained as part of the \textit{JWST DeepDive} Cycle 2 GO program. Our \textit{DeepDive} sample demonstrates early formation and quenching times inferred from spectro-photometric fitting, with most galaxies having formed 50\% of their stellar mass by $z \sim 5$, and quenching by $z \sim 4$, showing good agreement across the various SFH parameterizations explored in this work. Though they differ slightly between SFH parameterizations, the inferred formation timescales for the {\it DeepDive} sample span both rapid ($\lesssim$ 100 Myr) and more extended ($\gtrsim$ 200 Myr) episodes, corresponding to star formation occurring over a few to several dynamical times given their compact sizes and high densities at $z\sim3-4$. On average, massive quiescent galaxies at $3<z<4$ are $α$-enhanced ($\langle [α/\mathrm{Fe}]\rangle$= $0.22^{+0.22}\_{-0.17}$), although there is strong diversity ($\sim0.3$ dex in scatter) among individual [$α$/Fe] values. Our results for $α$-enhancement are consistent with lower-redshift studies, implying weak evolution in [$α$/Fe] from $z \sim 4$ to $z\sim 1$. The SFH timescales associated with the low [$α$/Fe] measurements suggest longer formation timescales, potentially pointing to earlier enrichment by Type Ia supernovae, or metals preferentially being removed via outflows driven either by powerful early active galactic nuclei or supernovae. Overall, this work represents the first, statistically representative combined study of the star-formation histories and chemical abundances of massive quiescent galaxies at $z>3$.

2026-02-02, **Universal Relations and Correlation Analysis of Proto-Neutron Star Properties in Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity**, Sayantan Ghosh et.al., [2602.02069v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02069v1)

 Proto-neutron stars (PNSs) are the hot, lepton-rich remnants of the core collapse supernovae, which go through a cooling phase and become cold, stable Neutron stars (NSs). Since PNSs are also superdense objects with strong gravitational fields, we can use them to probe general relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime, similar to NSs. In this study, we analyze the macroscopic properties like mass, radius, compactness, tidal deformability, $f$-mode oscillations and gravitational binding energy of PNSs using four different relativistic mean-field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs) with fixed entropy per baryon ($S$ =1, 2) and varying the lepton fractions ($Y\_l$). The variation of $S$ and $Y\_l$ has a noticeable effect on these properties. Extending our study beyond GR, we explore these effects within the framework of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG). This modified gravity theory adds the squared energy-momentum terms to the field equations with a free parameter $α$. In the weak-field regimes, EMSG remains indistinguishable from GR, but in the strong-field regimes, such as PNSs or NSs, it shows measurable deviations. Varying the free parameter $α$, we observe significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the PNSs. After that, we focus on the universal relations of the macroscopic properties and the correlations of the universal relations. We find that, despite significant changes in the macroscopic properties induced by the variations of $S$, $Y\_l$ and $α$, the correlations remain strong and nearly unaffected.
