2025-01-29, **Implications of the first CONUS+ measurement of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering**, Valentina De Romeri et.al., [2501.17843v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17843v1)

 The CONUS+ collaboration has reported their first observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS).The experiment uses reactor electron antineutrinos and germanium detectors with recoil thresholds as low as $160~\mathrm{eV\_{ee}}$. With an exposure of $347$ kg $\times$ d, the measurement was made with a statistical significance of $3.7 \sigma$. We explore several physics implications of this observation, both within the Standard Model and in the context of new physics. We focus on a determination of the weak mixing angle, non-standard and generalized neutrino interactions both with heavy and light mediators, neutrino magnetic moments, and the up-scattering of neutrinos into sterile fermions through the sterile dipole portal and new mediators. Our results highlight the r\^ole of reactor-based CE$\nu$NS experiments in probing a vast array of neutrino properties and new physics models.

2025-01-29, **MuonSLab: A plastic scintillator based detector for muon measurement in the deep ocean**, Jiacheng Wu et.al., [2501.17639v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17639v1)

 Atmospheric muons are important probes for studying primary cosmic rays and extensive air showers. Additionally, they constitute a significant background for many underground and deep-sea neutrino experiments, such as TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT). Understanding the muon flux at various depths in the deep sea is essential for validating TRIDENT simulations and guiding the development of optimized trigger strategies. This paper introduces a novel device based on plastic scintillalors and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) named MuonSLab, which is designed to measure muon flux in the deep sea and has the potential to be extended to other atmospheric muon property measurements. We discuss the design and instrumentation of MuonSLab and present results from several muon flux measurements, demonstrating its sensitivity to muon detection and its stability during operations across multiple locations.

2025-01-29, **Multi-messenger Emission by Magnetically Arrested Disks and Relativistic Jets of Black Hole X-ray Binaries**, Riku Kuze et.al., [2501.17467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17467v1)

 Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) are observed in various wavelengths from radio to GeV gamma-ray. Several BHXBs, including MAXI J1820+070 and Cygnus X-1, are also found to emit ultrahigh-energy (UHE; photon energy $>$100 TeV) gamma rays. The origin and production mechanism of the multi-wavelength emission of BHXBs are under debate. We propose a scenario where relativistic particles from magnetically arrested disks (MADs), which could form when BHXBs are in quiescent or hard states, produce UHE gamma rays, while electrons in the jets produce GeV gamma-ray emission. Specifically, magnetic turbulence in MADs heats up and accelerates electrons and protons, while magnetic reconnection in jets accelerates electrons. Sub-PeV gamma rays and neutrinos are produced when relativistic protons interact with the thermal protons and the radiation by thermal electrons in the disk. We discuss the perspectives of observing sub-PeV multi-messenger signals from individual BHXBs. Finally, we evaluate the integrated fluxes of the quiescent and hard-state BHXB population and find that BHXBs may contribute to the Galactic diffuse emission above $\sim 100$ TeV.

2025-01-29, **Direct Search signal of two-component Dark Matter**, Subhaditya Bhattacharya et.al., [2501.17862v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17862v1)

 How do we know if the dark sector consists of more than one dark matter (DM) component is an important question, for which the answer is not very definite. In this article we study such a possibility in context of direct DM search. It was pointed out earlier in a model independent analysis that a kink in the nuclear recoil energy spectrum may indicate to the presence of two DM components. However, realising one such model was difficult due to experimental constraints. Here we propose and study a model containing a vector boson DM and a scalar DM, aided by a light scalar mediator, where a kink in the nuclear recoil spectrum arises after addressing individual relic densities, direct search limits, collider constraints and theoretical limits. We find out the allowed parameter space of the model and those regions likely to show such distinctive signal.

2025-01-29, **Looking at infrared background radiation anisotropies with Spitzer: large scale anisotropies and their implications**, A. Kashlinsky et.al., [2501.17751v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17751v1)

 We use Spitzer/IRAC deep exposure data covering two significantly larger than before sky areas to construct maps suitable for evaluating source-subtracted fluctuations in the cosmic infrared background (CIB). The maps are constructed using the self-calibration methodology eliminating artifacts to sufficient accuracy and subset maps are selected in each area containing approximately uniform exposures. These maps are clipped and removed of known sources and then Fourier transformed to probe the CIB anisotropies to new larger scales. The power spectrum of the resultant CIB anisotropies is measured from the data to >1 degree revealing the component well above that from remaining known galaxies on scales >1 arcmin. The fluctuations are demonstrated to be free of Galactic and Solar System foreground contributions out to the largest scales measured. We discuss the proposed theories for the origin of the excess CIB anisotropies in light of the new data. Out of these, the model where the CIB fluctuation excess originates from the granulation power due to LIGO-observed primordial black holes as dark matter appears most successful in accounting for all observations related to the measured CIB power amplitude and spatial structure, including the measured coherence between the CIB and unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXB). Finally we point out the use of the data to probe the CIB-CXB cross-power to new scales and higher accuracy. We also discuss the synergy of these data with future CIB programs at shorter near-IR wavelengths with deep wide surveys and sub-arcsecond angular resolution as provided by Euclid and Roman space missions.

2025-01-29, **A Semi-analytic Framework of Population III and Subsequent Galaxy Formation on Ultralarge Cosmological N-body Simulations**, Tomoaki Ishiyama et.al., [2501.17540v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17540v1)

 We develop a new semi-analytic framework of Population (Pop) III and subsequent galaxy formation designed to run on dark matter halo merger trees. In our framework, we consider the effect of the Lyman-Werner flux from Pop III and II stars and the dark matter baryon streaming velocity on the critical minihalo mass for the Pop III formation. Our model incorporates the Lyman-Werner feedback in a self-consistent way, therefore, the spatial variation of Lyman-Werner feedback naturally emerges. The Pop III mass depends on the properties of a minihalo as reproducing radiative hydrodynamical simulation results. We perform statistical studies of Pop III stars by applying this framework to high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations with a maximum box size of 16 Mpc/h and enough mass resolution to resolve Pop III-forming minihalos. A top-heavy initial mass function emerges and two peaks corresponding to the H$\_2$ ($20 \lesssim z \lesssim 25$) and atomic cooling halos ($z \lesssim 15$) exist in the distribution. Supermassive stars can be formed in the atomic cooling halos, and the fractions of such supermassive stars increase with the value of streaming velocity. At least an 8 Mpc/h simulation box and the self-consistent model for the Lyman-Werner feedback are necessary to correctly model the Pop III formation in the atomic cooling halos. Our model predicts one supermassive star per halo with several $10^9$ Msun at z=7.5, which is enough to reproduce a high redshift quasar.

2025-01-29, **Formation of first star clusters under the supersonic gas flow -- II. Critical halo mass and core mass function**, Shingo Hirano et.al., [2501.17491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17491v1)

 The formation and mass distribution of the first stars depend on various environmental factors in the early universe. We compare 120 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to explore how the baryonic streaming velocity (SV) relative to dark matter affects the formation of the first stars. We vary SV from zero to three times its cosmic root-mean-square value, $v\_{\rm SV}/\sigma\_{\rm SV}=0-3$, and identify 20 representative halos from cosmological simulations. For each model, we follow the evolution of a primordial star-forming cloud from the first appearance of a dense core (with gas density > $10^{6}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$) until 2 Myr later. In each model, higher SV systematically delays the formation of primordial clouds, formed inside more massive halos ($10^{5}-10^{7}\,{\rm M}\_\odot$), and promotes cloud-scale fragmentation and multiple-core formation. The number and total mass of dense cores increase with increasing SV. More than half of models with $v\_{\rm SV}/\sigma\_{\rm SV} \ge 1.5$ form three or more dense cores in a single halo. In extreme cases, up to 25 cores form at once, which leaves a massive first star cluster. On the other hand, models with $v\_{\rm SV}/\sigma\_{\rm SV} \leq 1$ form only one or two cores in a halo. In addition, HD-cooling is often enabled in models with low SV, especially in low-z, where HD-cooling is enabled in more than 50% of models. This leads to the formation of the low-mass first star. SV shapes the resulting initial mass function of the first stars and plays a critical role in setting the star-forming environment of the first galaxies.

2025-01-29, **Dark Matter Substructure: A Lensing Perspective**, Charles Gannon et.al., [2501.17362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17362v1)

 The study of dark matter substructure through strong gravitational lensing has shown enormous promise in probing the properties of dark matter on sub-galactic scales. This approach has already been used to place strong constraints on a wide range of dark matter models including self-interacting dark matter, fuzzy dark matter and warm dark matter. A major source of degeneracy exists between suppression of low mass halos due to novel dark matter physics and the strength of tidal stripping experienced by subhalos. We study theoretical predictions for the statistical properties of subhalos in strong gravitational lenses using the semi-analytic galaxy formation toolkit: \galns. We present a large suite of dark matter only \gal models, spanning nearly two orders of magnitude in host halo mass (from Milky Way to group mass halos between redshifts from $0.2$ to $0.8$). Additionally, we include a smaller set of \gal runs with the potential of a central massive elliptical to complement our dark matter only suite of models. We place particular focus on quantities relevant to strong gravitational lensing; namely the projected number density of substructure near the Einstein radius as function of host stellar mass and redshift. In the innermost region in projection, we find that our \gal models agrees with N-body simulations within a factor of $\sim 2$ within the Einstein radius. We find that the addition of a central galaxy suppresses the projected number density of subhalos within in the Einstein radius by around $15\%$ relative to dark matter only simulations.

2025-01-29, **Can circumstellar interaction explain the strange light curve features of Type Ib/c supernovae?**, Andrea P. Nagy et.al., [2501.17543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17543v1)

 Context. The evolution and the surrounding of stripped-envelope supernova progenitors are still under debate: some studies suggest single-star, while others prefer massive binary progenitors. Moreover, the basic physical properties of the exploding star and its interaction with circumstellar matter could significantly modify the overall light curve features of these objects. To better understand the effect of stellar evolution and circumstellar interaction, systematic hydrodynamic calculations are needed.   Aims. Here, we test the hypothesis that circumstellar matter generated by an extreme episodic $\eta$ Carinae-like eruption that occurs days or weeks before the supernova explosion may explain the controversies related to the general light curve features of stripped-envelope supernovae.   Methods. In this work, we present our bolometric light curve calculations of both single- and binary progenitors generated by hydrodynamic simulations via MESA and SNEC. We also studied the effect of an interaction with a close, low-mass circumstellar matter assumed to be created just a few days or weeks before the explosion. Beyond generating a model light curve grid, we compared our results with some observational data.   Results. We found that merely the shape of the supernova light curve could indicate that the cataclysmic death of the massive star happened in a binary system or was related to the explosion of a single star. Moreover, our study also shows that a confined dense circumstellar matter may be responsible for the strange light curve features (bumps, re-brightening, or steeper tail) of some Type Ib/c supernovae.
