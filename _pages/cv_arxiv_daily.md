2024-04-04, **Neutrino mean free path in neutron stars in the presence of hyperons**, Jesper Leong et.al., [2404.03213v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03213v1)

 We investigate the neutrino elastic differential cross-section (NDCS) and corresponding mean free path for neutral current scattering in the dense matter of a neutron star. A wide range of observed neutron star (NS) masses is considered, including the presence of $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\Xi^{0}$ hyperons in the heaviest stars. Their presence significantly decreases the total neutrino mean free path in the heavier stars.

2024-04-04, **Magnetic fields from small-scale primordial perturbations**, Nanoom Lee et.al., [2404.03655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03655v1)

 Weak magnetic fields must have existed in the early Universe, as they were sourced by the cross product of electron density and temperature gradients through the Biermann-battery mechanism. In this paper we calculate the magnetic fields generated at cosmic dawn by a variety of small-scale primordial perturbations, carefully computing the evolution of electron density and temperature fluctuations, and consistently accounting for relative velocities between baryons and dark matter. We first compute the magnetic field resulting from standard, nearly scale-invariant primordial adiabatic perturbations, making significant improvements to previous calculations. This "standard" primordial field has a root mean square (rms) of $\sim10^{-15}$ nG at $20\lesssim z \lesssim 100$, with fluctuations on $\sim$ kpc comoving scales, and could serve as the seed of present-day magnetic fields observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. In addition, we consider early-Universe magnetic fields as a possible probe of non-standard initial conditions of the Universe on small scales $k \sim 1-10^3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To this end, we compute the maximally-allowed magnetic fields within current upper limits on small-scale adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations. Under the current Cosmic Microwave Background spectral-distortion constraints magnetic fields could be produced with a rms of $\sim 5\times 10^{-11}$ nG at $z = 20$. Uncorrelated small-scale isocurvature perturbations within current Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis bounds could potentially enhance the magnetic field to $\sim 10^{-14}-10^{-10}$ nG at $z = 20$, depending on the specific isocurvature mode considered. While these very weak fields remain well below current observational capabilities, our work points out that magnetic fields could potentially provide an interesting window into the poorly constrained small-scale initial conditions of the Universe.

2024-04-04, **ToMCCA: A Toy Monte Carlo Coalescence Afterburner**, Maximilian Mahlein et.al., [2404.03352v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03352v1)

 The study of antinuclei in cosmic rays provides a unique opportunity to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. Antinuclei in our Galaxy may stem either from annihilation or decay of dark matter, or from collisions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, which constitute the background of indirect dark matter searches. Understanding the formation mechanism of (anti)nuclei is crucial for setting limits on their production in space. Coalescence models, which describe the formation of light nuclei from final-state interaction of nucleons, have been widely employed in high-energy collisions. In this work, we introduce ToMCCA (Toy Monte Carlo Coalescence Afterburner), which allows for detailed studies of the nuclear formation processes without the overload of general-purpose event generators. ToMCCA contains parameterizations of the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum distributions of protons and of the baryon-emitting source size, extracted from ALICE measurements in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5 - 13$ TeV, as well as of the event multiplicity distributions, taken from the EPOS event generator. ToMCCA provides predictions of the deuteron transverse momentum distributions, with an agreement of $\sim5\%$ with the experimental data. The results of ToMCCA show that the coalescence mechanism in pp collisions depends only on the event multiplicity rather than on the collision system or its energy. This allows the model to be utilized for predictions at lower center-of-mass collision energies, which are the most relevant for the production of antinuclei from processes related to dark matter. This model can also be extended to heavier nuclei as long as the target nucleus wave function and its Wigner function are known.

2024-04-04, **Primordial Black Hole Interpretation in Subsolar Mass Gravitational Wave Candidate SSM200308**, Chen Yuan et.al., [2404.03328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03328v1)

 In the recent second part of the third observation run by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, a candidate with sub-solar mass components was reported, which we labelled as SSM200308. This study investigates the premise that primordial black holes (PBHs), arising from Gaussian perturbation collapses, could explain SSM200308. Through Bayesian analysis, we obtain the primordial curvature power spectrum that leads to the merger rate of PBHs aligning with observational data as long as they constitute $3.54^{+7.66}\_{-2.82}\times 10^{-3}$ of the dark matter. However, while the gravitational wave (GW) background from binary PBH mergers is within current observational limits, the scalar-induced GWs associated with PBH formation exceed the constraints imposed by pulsar timing arrays, challenging the Gaussian perturbation collapse PBH model as the source of SSM200308.

2024-04-04, **Discrete origins of matter**, Gauhar Abbas et.al., [2404.03232v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03232v1)

 We discuss models of the flavour problem and dark matter based on the discrete $\mathcal{Z}\_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}\_{\rm M} \times \mathcal{Z}\_{\rm P}$ flavour symmetry. A new class of dark-matter emerges out of these models, which is defined as the flavonic dark matter. An ultra-violet completion of these models based on the dark-technicolour paradigm is also presented.

2024-04-04, **SUSHI: An algorithm for source separation of hyperspectral images with non-stationary spectral variation**, Julia Lascar et.al., [2404.03490v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03490v1)

 Hyperspectral images are data cubes with two spatial dimensions and a third spectral dimension, providing a spectrum for each pixel, and thus allow the mapping of extended sources' physical properties. In this article, we present the Semi-blind Unmixing with Sparsity for Hyperspectral Images (SUSHI), an algorithm for non-stationary unmixing of hyperspectral images with spatial regularization of spectral parameters. The method allows for the disentangling of physical components without the assumption of a unique spectrum for each component. Thus, unlike most source separation methods used in astrophysics, all physical components obtained by SUSHI vary in spectral shape and in amplitude across the data cube.   Non-stationary source separation is an ill-posed inverse problem that needs to be constrained. We achieve this by training a spectral model and applying a spatial regularization constraint on its parameters. For the spectral model, we used an Interpolatory Auto-Encoder, a generative model that can be trained with limited samples. For spatial regularization, we applied a sparsity constraint on the wavelet transform of the model parameter maps.   We applied SUSHI to a toy model meant to resemble supernova remnants in X-ray astrophysics, though the method may be used on any extended source with any hyperspectral instrument. We compared this result to the one obtained by a classic 1D fit on each individual pixel. We find that SUSHI obtains more accurate results, particularly when it comes to reconstructing physical parameters. We applied SUSHI to real X-ray data from the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A and to the Crab Nebula. The results obtained are realistic and in accordance with past findings but have a much better spatial resolution. Thanks to spatial regularization, SUSHI can obtain reliable physical parameters at fine scales that are out of reach for pixel-by-pixel methods.

2024-04-04, **Exploring Universe acceleration through observational constraints via Hubble parameter reconstruction**, M. Koussour et.al., [2404.03362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03362v1)

 In this article, we introduce an innovative parametric representation of the Hubble parameter, providing a model-independent means to explore the dynamics of an accelerating cosmos. The model's parameters are rigorously constrained through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, leveraging a comprehensive dataset consisting of 31 data points from cosmic chronometers (CC), 1701 updated observations of Pantheon supernovae type Ia (SNeIa), and 6 data points from baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). Our analysis delves into the behavior of various cosmological parameters within the model, including the transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating one, as well as the density parameters and the equation of state (EoS) parameter. The outcomes of our investigation reveal that the equation of state parameter aligns with characteristics reminiscent of the phantom model, supporting the prevailing understanding of our universe's current state of acceleration. This research contributes valuable insights into the ongoing cosmic expansion and underscores the utility of our novel parametric approach.

2024-04-04, **Searching for binary black hole sub-populations in gravitational wave data using binned Gaussian processes**, Anarya Ray et.al., [2404.03166v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03166v1)

 Astrophysically motivated population models for binary black hole observables are often insufficient to capture the imprints of multiple formation channels. This is mainly due to the strongly parametrized nature of such investigations. Using a non-parametric model for the joint population-level distributions of binary black hole component masses and effective inspiral spins, we find hints of multiple subpopulations in the third gravitational wave transient catalog. The higher (more positive) spin subpopulation is found to have a mass-spectrum without any feature at the $30-40M\_{\odot}$, which is consistent with the predictions of isolated stellar binary evolution, simulations for which place the pile up due to pulsational pair-instability supernovae near $50M\_{\odot}$ or higher. The other sub-population with effective spins closer to zero shows a feature at $30-40M\_{\odot}$ and is consistent with binary black holes formed dynamically in globular clusters, which are expected to peak around $30M\_{\odot}$. We also compute merger rates for these two subpopulations and find that they are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the corresponding formation channels. We validate our results by checking their robustness against variations of several model configurations and by analyzing large simulated catalogs with the same model.
