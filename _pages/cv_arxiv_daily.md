2024-04-23, **The Type-I Seesaw family**, Salvador Centelles Chuli√° et.al., [2404.15415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15415v1)

 We provide a comprehensive analysis of the Type-I Seesaw family of neutrino mass models, including the conventional type-I seesaw and its low-scale variants, namely the linear and inverse seesaws. We establish that all these models essentially correspond to a particular form of the type-I seesaw in the context of explicit lepton number violation. We then focus into the more interesting scenario of spontaneous lepton number violation, systematically categorizing all inequivalent minimal models. Furthermore, we identify and flesh out specific models that feature a rich majoron phenomenology and discuss some scenarios which, despite having heavy mediators and being invisible in processes such as $\mu \to e \gamma$, predict sizable rates for decays including the majoron in the final state.

2024-04-23, **Axions in the Dark Dimension**, Naomi Gendler et.al., [2404.15414v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15414v1)

 The dark dimension scenario, which is motivated from Swampland principles and predicts a single micron scale extra dimension, suggests a consistent framework for the dark sector of the universe. We consider the implications of this scenario for the QCD axion. We find that in the scenario in which the axion is localized on the standard model brane (which we will argue is natural), a combination of theoretical (being bounded by the 5D Planck mass) and observational constraints forces it to have decay constant in a narrow range $f \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$ GeV. This corresponds to a mass for the QCD axion of $m\_a \sim (1 - 10)$ meV. The axion mass surprisingly coincides with the mass scale for the dark energy, the dark matter tower, and the neutrinos. In this scenario axions are not expected to form a large fraction of the dark matter but nevertheless this range of axion parameters is accessible to observations in near future experiments.

2024-04-23, **Dark Radiation with Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI 2024 and the $H_0$ tension**, Itamar J. Allali et.al., [2404.15220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15220v1)

 We investigate the presence of extra relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe, contributing to the effective number of neutrinos $N\_\text{eff}$, as $\Delta N\_\text{eff}\equiv N\_\text{eff}-3.044\geq 0$, in light of the recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by the DESI collaboration. We analyze one-parameter extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model where dark radiation (DR) is free streaming or behaves as a perfect fluid, due to self-interactions. We report a significant relaxation of upper bounds on $\Delta N\_\text{eff}$, with respect to previous BAO data from SDSS+6dFGS, when additionally employing Planck data (and supernovae data from Pantheon+), setting $\Delta N\_\text{eff}\leq 0.39$ ($95\%$ C.L.) for free streaming DR, and a very mild preference for fluid DR, $\Delta N\_\text{eff} = 0.221^{+0.088}\_{-0.18}$ ($\leq 0.46$, $95\%$ C.L.). Applying constraints from primordial element abundances leads to slightly tighter constraints on $\Delta N\_\text{eff}$, but they are avoided if DR is produced after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For fluid DR we estimate the tension with the SH$\_0$ES determination of $H\_0$ to be around $(2.3-2.8)\sigma$ level, and for free-streaming DR the tension is below $3\sigma$ if production occurs after BBN. This lesser degree of tension motivates a combination with SH$\_0$ES in these cases, resulting in a $4.4\sigma-5\sigma$ evidence for dark radiation with $\Delta N\_\text{eff}\simeq 0.6$ and large improvements in $\chi^2$ over $\Lambda$CDM, $-18\lesssim \Delta \chi^2\lesssim -25$.

2024-04-23, **Solar flare observations with the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G)**, S. Agarwal et.al., [2404.14995v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14995v1)

 The science program of the Radio Neutrino Observatory-Greenland (RNO-G) extends beyond particle astrophysics to include radioglaciology and, as we show herein, solar physics, as well. Impulsive solar flare observations not only permit direct measurements of light curves, spectral content, and polarization on time scales significantly shorter than most extant dedicated solar observatories, but also offer an extremely useful above-surface calibration source, with pointing precision of order tens of arc-minutes. Using the early RNO-G data from 2022-2023, observed flare characteristics are compared to well-established solar observatories. Also, a number of individual flares are used to highlight angular reconstruction and calibration methods. RNO-G observes signal excesses during solar flares reported by the solar-observing Callisto network and in coincidence with about 60% of the brightest excesses recorded by the SWAVES satellite, when the Sun is above the horizon for RNO-G. In these observed flares, there is significant impulsivity in the time-domain. In addition, the solar flares are used to calibrate the RNO-G absolute pointing on the radio signal arrival direction to sub-degree resolution.

2024-04-23, **Particle Swam Optimization Based Analysis to Unlocking the Neutrino Mass Puzzle using $A_{4}\times Z_{3}\times Z_{10}$ Flavor Symmetry**, M. W. Aslam et.al., [2404.14917v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14917v1)

 New research has highlighted a shortfall in the Standard Model (SM) because it predicts neutrinos to have zero mass. However, recent experiments on neutrino oscillation have revealed that the majority of neutrino parameters indeed indicate their significant mass. In response, scientists are increasingly incorporating discrete symmetries alongside continuous ones for better justification of observed patterns of neutrino mixing. In this study, we have examined a model within $A\_4\times Z\_3\times Z\_{10}$ symmetry to estimate the neutrino masses using particle swam optimization technique for both mass hierarchy of neutrino. This model employed a hybrid seesaw mechanism, a combination of seesaw mechanism of type-I and type-II, to establish the effective Majorana neutrino mass matrix. After calculating the mass eigenvalues and lepton mixing matrix upto second order perturbation theory in this framework, this study seeks to investigate the scalar potential for vacuum expectation values (VEVs), optimize the parameters, $U\_{PMNS}$ matrix, neutrino masses: $\|{m\_{1}^{\prime}}^N\|=0.0292794-0.0435082\ eV$, $\|{m\_{2}^{\prime}}^N\|=1.78893\times 10^{-18}-0.0293509\ eV$, $\|{m\_{3}^{\prime}}^N\|=0.0307414-0.0471467\ eV$, $\|{m\_{1}^{\prime}}^I\|=0.00982013-0.0453623\ eV$, $\|{m\_{2}^{\prime}}^I\_\|=0.0379702-0.0471197\ eV$, and $\|{m\_{3}^{\prime}}^I\|=0.0122063-0.027544\ eV$, effective neutrino mass parameters: $\langle {m\_{ee}} \rangle^N=(0.170-3.93)\times10^{-2}\ eV$, $\langle {m\_{\beta}} \rangle^N=(0.471-1.39)\times10^{-2}\ eV$, $\langle {m\_{ee}} \rangle^I=(1.85-4.55)\times10^{-2}\ eV$ and $\langle {m\_{\beta}} \rangle^I=(2.26-4.56)\times10^{-2}\ eV$, are predicted for both mass hierarchy through particle swam optimization (PSO), showing strong agreement with recent experimental findings.

2024-04-23, **Asymmetric self-interacting dark matter with canonical seesaw**, Debasish Borah et.al., [2404.14912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14912v1)

 We study the possibility of generating dark matter (DM) and baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) simultaneously in an asymmetric DM framework which also alleviates the small-scale structure issues of cold DM (CDM). While thermal relic of such self-interacting DM (SIDM) remains under-abundant due to efficient annihilation into light mediators, a non-zero asymmetry in dark sector can lead to survival of the required DM in the universe. The existence of a light mediator leads to the required self-interactions of DM at small scales while keeping DM properties similar to CDM at large scales. It also ensures that the symmetric DM component annihilates away, leaving the asymmetric part, in the spirit of cogenesis. The particle physics implementation is done in canonical seesaw models of light neutrino mass, connecting it to the origin of DM and BAU. In particular, we consider type-I and type-III seesaw origin of neutrino mass for simplicity and minimality of the field content. We show that the desired self-interactions and relic of DM together with BAU while satisfying relevant constraints lead to strict limits on DM mass $\mathcal{O}(\rm GeV) \lesssim M\_{\rm DM} \lesssim460 $ GeV. In spite of being high scale seesaw, the models remain verifiable at different experiments including direct, indirect DM search as well as colliders.

2024-04-23, **Black hole-neutron star binaries**, Matthew D. Duez et.al., [2404.14782v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14782v1)

 The gravitational wave signals of black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary systems have now been detected, and future detections might be accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts. BHNS mergers involve much of the same physics as binary neutron star mergers: strong gravity, nuclear density matter, neutrino radiation, and magnetic turbulence. They also share with binary neutron star systems the potential for bright electromagnetic signals, especially gamma ray bursts and kilonovae, and the potential to be significant sources of r-process elements. However, BHNS binaries are more asymmetric, and their mergers produce different amounts and arrangements of the various post-merger material components (e.g. disk and dynamical ejecta), together with a more massive black hole; these differences can have interesting consequences. In this chapter, we review the modeling of BHNS mergers and post-merger evolution in numerical relativistic hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics. We attempt to give readers a broad understanding of the answers to the following questions. What are the main considerations that determine the merger outcome? What input physics must (or should) go into a BHNS simulation? What have the most advanced simulations to date learned?

2024-04-23, **A Ramsey Neutron-Beam Experiment to Search for Ultralight Axion Dark Matter at the ESS**, P. Fierlinger et.al., [2404.15521v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15521v1)

 High-intensity neutron beams, such as those available at the European Spallation Source (ESS), provide new opportunities for fundamental discoveries. Here we discuss a novel Ramsey neutron-beam experiment to search for ultralight axion dark matter through its coupling to neutron spins, which would cause the neutron spins to rotate about the velocity of the neutrons relative to the dark matter halo. We estimate that experiments at the HIBEAM beamline at the ESS can improve the sensitivity to the axion-neutron coupling compared to the current best laboratory limits by up to $2-3$ orders of magnitude over the axion mass range $10^{-22} \, \textrm{eV} - 10^{-16}$\,eV.

2024-04-23, **What drives the corpulence of galaxies? I. The formation of central compact dwarf galaxies in TNG50**, Abhner P. De Almeida et.al., [2404.15482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15482v1)

 Nearby dwarf galaxies display a variety of effective radii (sizes) at given stellar mass, suggesting different evolution scenarios according to their final "stellar" size. The TNG hydrodynamical simulations present a bimodality in the z = 0 size-mass relation (SMRz0) of dwarf galaxies, at $r\_{1/2,\star}$ ~ 450 pc. Using the TNG50 simulation, we explore the evolution of the most massive progenitors of dwarf galaxies (z=0 $\log( M\_\star / \mathrm{M}\_\odot)$ between 8.4 and 9.2) that ended up as central galaxies of their groups. We split these dwarfs into three classes of the SMRz0: Normals from the central spine of the main branch and Compacts from the secondary branch as well as from the lower envelope of the main branch. Both classes of Compacts see their stellar sizes decrease since z ~ 1 in contrast to Normals, while the sizes of the gas and dark matter (DM) components keep increasing (as for Normals). A detailed analysis reveals that Compacts live in poorer environments, thus suffer fewer major mergers since z=0.8 that otherwise pump angular momentum into the gas, allowing strong gas inflows, producing inner star formation, hence the buildup of a stellar core. Compacts are predicted to be rounder and with bluer cores. Compact dwarfs of similar sizes are observed in the GAMA survey, but the bimodality in sizes is less evident and the most compact dwarfs tend to be passive rather than star forming as in TNG50. Therefore, our conclusions should be confirmed with future cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.

2024-04-23, **Interacting Dark Energy after DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements**, William Giar√® et.al., [2404.15232v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15232v1)

 We investigate the implications of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models characterized by an energy-momentum flow from Dark Matter to Dark Energy. By combining Planck-2018 and DESI data, we observe a preference for interactions exceeding the 95% confidence level, yielding a present-day expansion rate $H\_0=71.4\pm1.5$ km/s/Mpc, in agreement with SH0ES. This preference remains robust when including measurements of the expansion rate $H(z)$ obtained from the relative ages of massive, early-time, and passively-evolving galaxies, as well as when considering distance moduli measurements from Type-Ia Supernovae sourced from the Pantheon-plus catalog using the SH0ES Cepheid host distances as calibrators. Overall, high and low redshift data can be equally or better explained within the IDE framework compared to $\Lambda$CDM, while also yielding higher values of $H\_0$ in better agreement with the local distance ladder estimate.

2024-04-23, **Confronting Dark Matter Capture Rate with Continuous Gravitational Wave Probe of Local Neutron Stars**, Pooja Bhattacharjee et.al., [2404.15038v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15038v1)

 Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.

2024-04-23, **Probing bottom-associated production of a TeV scale scalar decaying to a top quark and dark matter at the LHC**, Amandeep Kaur Kalsi et.al., [2404.14844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14844v1)

 A minimal non-thermal dark matter model that can explain both the existence of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry in the universe is studied. It requires two color-triplet, iso-singlet scalars with $\mathcal{O}$(TeV) masses and a singlet Majorana fermion with a mass of $\mathcal{O}$(GeV). The fermion becomes stable and can play the role of the dark matter candidate. We consider the fermion to interact with a top quark via the exchange of QCD-charged scalar fields coupled dominantly to third generation fermions. The signature of a single top quark production associated with a bottom quark and large missing transverse momentum opens up the possibility to search for this type of model at the LHC in a way complementary to existing monotop searches.

2024-04-23, **Constraining dark energy equations of state in $F(R,T)$ gravity**, Ahmed Errahmani et.al., [2404.15537v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15537v1)

 In this paper, we examine the acceleration of the Universe's expansion in $F(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T$ the trace of energy-momentum tensor. Indeed, the unknown nature of the source controlling this acceleration in general relativity leads scientists to investigate its properties by means of some alternative theories to general relativity. Our study is restricted to the particular case where $F(R,T)=R+2\kappa^2 \lambda T$ , with $\lambda$ being a constant. We use a Bayesian analysis of current observational datasets, including the type Ia supernovae constitution compilation and $H(z)$ measurements, to constrain free parameters of the model. To parametrize dark energy, we consider two well known equations of state. We find the best fit values for each model by running a Markov chain Monte Carlo technic. The best fit parameters are used to compare both models to $\Lambda$CDM by means of the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion. We show that the Universe underwent recently a transition from a deceleration to an acceleration for both models. Furthermore, the data shows a phantom nature of the equation of state for both models.

2024-04-23, **Photometry of Saturated Stars with Machine Learning**, Dominek Winecki et.al., [2404.15405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15405v1)

 We develop a deep neural network (DNN) to obtain photometry of saturated stars in the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). The DNN can obtain unbiased photometry for stars from g=4 to 14 mag with a dispersion (15%-85% 1sigma range around median) of 0.12 mag for saturated (g<11.5 mag) stars. More importantly, the light curve of a non-variable saturated star has a median dispersion of only 0.037 mag. The DNN light curves are, in many cases, spectacularly better than provided by the standard ASAS-SN pipelines. While the network was trained on g band data from only one of ASAS-SN's 20 cameras, initial experiments suggest that it can be used for any camera and the older ASAS-SN V band data as well. The dominant problems seem to be associated with correctable issues in the ASAS-SN data reduction pipeline for saturated stars more than the DNN itself. The method is publicly available as a light curve option on ASAS-SN Sky Patrol v1.0.

2024-04-23, **Nonthermal Signatures of Radiative Supernova Remnants**, Rebecca Diesing et.al., [2404.15396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15396v1)

 The end of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution is characterized by a so-called "radiative" stage, in which efficient cooling of the hot bubble inside the forward shock slows expansion, leading to eventual shock breakup. Understanding SNR evolution at this stage is vital for predicting feedback in galaxies, since SNRs are expected to deposit their energy and momentum into the interstellar medium at the ends of their lives. A key prediction of SNR evolutionary models is the formation at the onset of the radiative stage of a cold, dense shell behind the forward shock. However, searches for these shells via their neutral hydrogen emission have had limited success. We instead introduce an independent observational signal of shell formation arising from the interaction between nonthermal particles accelerated by the SNR forward shock (cosmic rays) and the dense shell. Using a semi-analytic model of particle acceleration based on state-of-the-art simulations coupled with a high-resolution hydrodynamic model of SNR evolution, we predict the nonthermal emission that arises from this interaction. We demonstrate that the onset of the radiative stage leads to nonthermal signatures from radio to $\gamma$-rays, including radio and $\gamma$-ray brightening by nearly two orders of magnitude. Such a signature may be detectable with current instruments, and will be resolvable with the next generation of gamma-ray telescopes (namely, the Cherenkov Telescope Array).

2024-04-23, **Detecting unresolved lensed SNe Ia in LSST using blended light curves**, Satadru Bag et.al., [2404.15389v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15389v1)

 Strong-gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe) are promising probes for providing absolute distance measurements using gravitational lens time delays. Spatially unresolved LSNe offer an opportunity to enhance the sample size for precision cosmology. We predict that there will be approximately $3$ times more unresolved than resolved LSNe Ia in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the Rubin Observatory. In this article, we explore the feasibility of detecting unresolved LSNe Ia from the shape of the observed blended light curves using deep learning techniques, and we find that $\sim 30\%$ can be detected with a simple 1D CNN using well-sampled $rizy$-band light curves (with a false-positive rate of $\sim 3\%$). Even when the light curve is well-observed in only a single band among $r$, $i$, and $z$, detection is still possible with false-positive rates ranging from $\sim 4-7\%$, depending on the band. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these unresolved cases can be detected at an early stage using light curves up to $\sim20$ days from the first observation, with well-controlled false-positive rates, providing ample opportunities for triggering follow-up observations. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of time-delay estimations using solely LSST-like data of unresolved light curves, particularly for doubles, when excluding systems with low time delay and magnification ratio. However, the abundance of such systems among those unresolved in LSST poses a significant challenge. This approach holds potential utility for upcoming wide-field surveys, and overall results could significantly improve with enhanced cadence and depth in the future surveys.

 We investigate the implications of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models characterized by an energy-momentum flow from Dark Matter to Dark Energy. By combining Planck-2018 and DESI data, we observe a preference for interactions exceeding the 95% confidence level, yielding a present-day expansion rate $H\_0=71.4\pm1.5$ km/s/Mpc, in agreement with SH0ES. This preference remains robust when including measurements of the expansion rate $H(z)$ obtained from the relative ages of massive, early-time, and passively-evolving galaxies, as well as when considering distance moduli measurements from Type-Ia Supernovae sourced from the Pantheon-plus catalog using the SH0ES Cepheid host distances as calibrators. Overall, high and low redshift data can be equally or better explained within the IDE framework compared to $\Lambda$CDM, while also yielding higher values of $H\_0$ in better agreement with the local distance ladder estimate.

2024-04-23, **Uncovering an Excess of X-ray Point Sources in the Halos of Virgo Late-type Galaxies**, Zhensong Hu et.al., [2404.15057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15057v1)

 We present a systematic search for extraplanar X-ray point sources around 19 late-type, highly inclined disk galaxies residing in the Virgo cluster, based on archival Chandra observations reaching a source detection sensitivity of $L\rm(0.5- 8~keV)\sim10^{38}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$. Based on the cumulative source surface density distribution as a function of projected vertical distance from the disk mid-plane, we identify a statistically significant ($\sim3.3\sigma$) excess of $\sim20$ X-ray sources within a projected vertical off-disk distance of $0.92'-2.5'$ ($\sim4.4-12\ \mathrm{kpc}$), the presence of which cannot be explained by the bulk stellar content of the individual galaxies, nor by the cosmic X-ray background. On the other hand, there is no significant evidence for an excess of extraplanar X-ray sources in a comparison sample of field late-type edge-on galaxies, for which Chandra observations reaching a similar source detection sensitivity are available. We discuss possible origins for the observed excess, which include low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) associated with globular clusters, supernova-kicked LMXBs, high-mass X-ray binaries born in recent star formation induced by ram pressure stripping of the disk gas, as well as a class of intra-cluster X-ray sources previously identified around early-type member galaxies of Virgo. We find that none of these X-ray populations can naturally dominate the observed extraplanar excess, although supernova-kicked LMXBs and the effect of ram pressure are most likely relevant

2024-04-23, **Planetary nebula morphologies indicate a jet-driven explosion of SN 1987A and other core-collapse supernovae**, Noam Soker et.al., [2404.14843v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14843v1)

 I demonstrate the usage of planetary nebulae (PNe) to infer that a pair of jets shaped the ejecta of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 1987A. The main structure of the SN 1987A inner ejecta, the keyhole, comprised two low-intensity zones. The northern one has a bright rim on its front, while the southern one has an elongated nozzle. Earlier comparison of the SN 1987A keyhole with bubbles in the galaxy group NGC 5813 led to its identification as a jet-shaped rim-nozzle structure. Here, I present rim-nozzle asymmetry in planetary nebulae (PNe), thought to be shaped by jets, which solidify the claim that jets powered the ejecta of SN 1987A and other CCSNe. This finding for the iconic SN 1987A with its unique properties strengthens the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe. In a few hundred years, the CCSN 1987A will have a complicated structure with two main symmetry axes, one along the axis of the three circumstellar rings that two opposite 20,000-years pre-explosion jets shaped, and the other along the long axis of the keyhole that was shaped by the main jet pair of the exploding jets of SN 1987A in the frame of the JJEM.
