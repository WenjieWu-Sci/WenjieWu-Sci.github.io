2025-11-20, **Prospects for Neutrino Observation and Mass Measurement from Binary Neutron Star Mergers**, Vedran Brdar et.al., [2511.16658v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16658v1)

 Over the next decade, $\mathcal{O}(100)$ diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) events are expected in Hyper-Kamiokande. Another neutrino source that has received far less attention is binary neutron star mergers. Including the data from recent simulations, we find that detection in current and near-future neutrino experiments is not feasible, and a megaton-scale detector with $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV threshold, such as the proposed Deep-TITAND, MEMPHYS, or MICA, will be required. This is due to the updated binary neutron star merger rate and the time-of-flight delay caused by the nonzero neutrino mass. Regarding the former, recent results from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has significantly lowered the upper limit on the neutron star merger rate. As for the latter, neutrino events from neutron star mergers are expected to be recorded shortly after the gravitational wave signal. Limiting the analysis to such short time windows can significantly reduce background rates. While this approach has been qualitatively discussed in the literature, the effect of the time delay caused by neutrino mass, which can substantially extend the observation windows, has been disregarded. We present a refined analysis employing energy-dependent time windows and luminosity distance cuts for the mergers and provide realistic estimates of the detector runtime required to record neutrinos from binary neutron star mergers with small background contamination. The relative timing between the neutrino and gravitational wave signals can also be employed to probe the scale of neutrino mass. We find that the sensitivity to the lightest neutrino mass exceeds both the most stringent terrestrial bounds from KATRIN and the projections based on galactic supernovae. This level of sensitivity may become particularly relevant in the future if terrestrial and supernova constraints are not significantly improved.

2025-11-20, **A Core-Collapse Supernova Neutrino Parameterization with Enhanced Physical Interpretability**, Haihao Shi et.al., [2511.16631v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16631v1)

 We introduce a novel parameterization of supernova neutrino energy spectra with a clear physical motivation. Its central parameter, $τ(t)$, quantifies the characteristic thermal-diffusion area during the explosion. When applied to the historic SN1987A data, this parameterization yields statistically significant fits and provides robust constraints on the unobserved low-energy portion of the spectrum. Beyond this specific application, we demonstrate the model's power on a suite of 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, finding that the temporal evolution of $τ(t)$ distinctly separates successful from failed explosions. Furthermore, we constrain the progenitor mass of SN 1987A to approximately 19 solar masses by applying Smoothed Isotonic Regression, while noting the sensitivity of this estimate to observational uncertainties. Moreover, in these simulations, $τ(t)$ and the gravitational-wave strain amplitude display a strong, synergistic co-evolution, directly linking the engine's energetic evolution to its geometric asymmetry. This implies that the thermodynamic state of the explosion is imprinted not only on the escaping neutrino flux, but also recorded in the shape of the energy spectrum. Our framework therefore offers a valuable tool for decoding the detailed core dynamics and multi-messenger processes of future galactic supernovae.

2025-11-20, **Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Neutrino Reconstruction of Single-line Events in the ANTARES Telescope**, A. Albert et.al., [2511.16614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16614v1)

 We present the $N$-fit algorithm designed to improve the reconstruction of neutrino events detected by a single line of the ANTARES underwater telescope, usually associated with low energy neutrino events ($\sim$ 100 GeV). $N$-Fit is a neural network model that relies on deep learning and combines several advanced techniques in machine learning --deep convolutional layers, mixture density output layers, and transfer learning. This framework divides the reconstruction process into two dedicated branches for each neutrino event topology --tracks and showers-- composed of sub-models for spatial estimation --direction and position-- and energy inference, which later on are combined for event classification. Regarding the direction of single-line events, the $N$-Fit algorithm significantly refines the estimation of the zenithal angle, and delivers reliable azimuthal angle predictions that were previously unattainable with traditional $χ^2$-fit methods. Improving on energy estimation of single-line events is a tall order; $N$-Fit benefits from transfer learning to efficiently integrate key characteristics, such as the estimation of the closest distance from the event to the detector. $N$-Fit also takes advantage from transfer learning in event topology classification by freezing convolutional layers of the pretrained branches. Tests on Monte Carlo simulations and data demonstrate a significant reduction in mean and median absolute errors across all reconstructed parameters. The improvements achieved by $N$-Fit highlight its potential for advancing multimessenger astrophysics and enhancing our ability to probe fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model using single-line events from ANTARES data.

2025-11-20, **Two-beam Multiparticle Many-body simulations of Inhomogeneous FFI**, Zoha Laraib et.al., [2511.16506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16506v1)

 Neutrino flavor evolution in dense astrophysical environments is inherently nonlinear and sensitive to many-body (MB) quantum effects beyond the mean-field (MF) approximation. Existing MB studies are constrained by small system sizes, closed boundaries, and highly idealized symmetry assumptions. We present a unified tensor-network framework that enables simulations of inhomogeneous and anisotropic flavor evolution under conditions relevant to core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers. Within this framework, we examine the effects of inhomogeneity, boundary conditions, and convergence with resolution for multiple neutrino distributions, allowing direct comparison of these setups under one consistent formulation. In our simulations, many-body systems equilibrate earlier than their mean-field counterparts while approaching similar final flavor states. Enlarging the interaction region allows open boundaries to reproduce closed-system behavior, but only when the beams begin superimposed and interact continuously. By contrast, initially separated configurations develop entanglement more slowly, interact over longer times, and equilibrate to a flavor content that differs from that obtained from initially superimposed calculations.

2025-11-20, **Development & Characterization of Electrodes for large-scale Xenon Time Projection Chambers**, A. Elykov et.al., [2511.16408v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16408v1)

 Dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers are the core detector elements of many experiments that conduct searches for Dark Matter and rare events, as well as in neutrino and high-energy physics. As part of this detector technology, high-voltage electrodes are instrumental for the generation of observable signals and their physical interpretation. Thus, electrode design and manufacturing has to fulfill stringent requirements, and their production is associated with significant engineering challenges. In this work we describe the successful development of electrodes on the 1.5 m-scale, from their design and simulation to subsequent assembly and high-voltage testing in a gaseous argon environment. The produced electrodes were recently installed as an anode and a cathode during an upgrade to the XENONnT experiment.

2025-11-20, **Probing quark-lepton correlation in GUTs with high-precision neutrino measurements**, Zi-Qiang Chen et.al., [2511.16196v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16196v1)

 GUTs unify quarks and leptons into same representations and predict correlations between their masses and mixing. We take new data of JUNO and perform numerical scans to explore the flavor space compatible with data in SO(10) GUTs. The quark-lepton correlation shows the preference of normal ordering for light neutrino masses, predicts favored region of the CP-violating phase in neutrino oscillations, and classifies GUT models based their testability in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. The quark-lepton correlation predicts mass spectrum of right-handed neutrinos, pointing to the energy scale of baryon and lepton number violation and providing sources for baryogenesis. We emphasize that, as the high precision measurements of neutrino physics is coming, the quark-lepton correlation will provide increasingly important role in the testability of GUTs, complementary to the proton decay measurement.

2025-11-20, **Neutrino oscillations induced by a new bumblebee black hole**, Yuxuan Shi et.al., [2511.16181v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16181v1)

 This work investigates neutrino propagation in the spacetime of a newly introduced black hole arising from spontaneous Lorentz-symmetry breaking in bumblebee gravity. The analysis focuses on three independent components: the rate at which neutrino-antineutrino annihilation deposits energy in the surrounding region, the geometric contribution to the phase accumulated by neutrino mass eigenstates, and the modifications to flavor conversion produced by weak gravitational lensing. Working with a two-flavor system, both mass orderings are examined, and the calculation incorporates the interference between distinct trajectories reaching the detector. The numerical results show that the Lorentz-violating deformation substantially increases the efficiency of the annihilation channel, produces characteristic shifts in the oscillation phase not present in earlier bumblebee configurations, and reshapes the angular dependence of the lensing-induced flavor transition pattern.

2025-11-20, **Modified Tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing confront with JUNO $θ_{12}$ measurement**, Xiao-Gang He et.al., [2511.15978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15978v1)

 JUNO collaboration has realsed its first measurement of reactor neutrino oscillations results with $\sin^2θ\_{12} = 0.3092\pm 0.0087$ which improved the precision by a factor of 1.6 relative to the combination of all previous measurements. We confront the minimally modifred tri-bimaximal mixing pattern with the new data. Before the measurement of a non-zero $θ\_{13}$ mixing angle, the tri-bimximal mixing pattern predicting $θ\_{13}$ to be zero is one of the most popular simple ones. Modifications have been proposed to keep some features of tri-bimaximal mixing and make it to be consistent with data. One minimal scheme is to keep one of the coloums unchanged by modifing the neutrino mass matrix in models based on $A\_4$ flavor symmetry. Three mixing patterms ermergy, a) the third, b) the second and c) the first column in the $3\times 3$ mixing matrix separately unchaged. The option a) mantains the feature that $θ\_{13}=0$ which is in conflect with data on $θ\_{13}$ and therefore is ruled out. The option b) is the interesting mixing pattern with $θ\_{13}$ nonzero, but predicts $V\_{e2} = 1/\sqrt{3}$ with interesting predictions for CP violation and other mixing angles. The new $θ\_{12}$ value measured by JUNO with $\|V\_{e2}\|$ is, however, smaller than $1/\sqrt{3}$ at a more than 3.5$σ$ level making the search for alternative new paterns desirable. The option c) predicts $V\_{e2} = cosα/\sqrt{3}$ which can also accommodate known data at a better than 1$σ$ level. This mixing pattern predicts $\sin^2θ\_{12} = 1-3\sin^2θ\_{13}$. The model favors inverted neutrino mass herarcy with CP violating variable $\sin θ-0.84$ . Near future experiments can test the model.

2025-11-19, **Terrestrial Matter Effects on Reactor Antineutrino Oscillations: Constant vs. Fluctuated Density Profiles**, Yu-Feng Li et.al., [2511.15702v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15702v1)

 The JUNO Collaboration has recently released its first reactor antineutrino oscillation result, achieving unprecedented precision in the measurement of $Δm^2\_{21}$ and $\sin^2θ\_{12}$. We emphasize that the accurate determination and modeling of the terrestrial matter density profile are fundamental for extracting the oscillation parameters and probing the neutrino mass ordering. This paper presents a realistic piecewise-constant model for the shallow crustal density profile along the baselines from Taishan and Yangjiang to the experimental hall, based on geological and petrophysical information. The uncertainty in the density profiles arises from variations in the density and length of each segment, both of which are conservatively estimated to be 10\%. A careful comparison of constant and fluctuated density profiles is provided and the implications for the precision measurement of oscillation parameters are discussed. Finally, we also discuss the possibility of tomography of the shallow Earth's crust in future reactor neutrino experiments.

2025-11-19, **Trimaximal Mixing Patterns Meet the First JUNO Result**, Di Zhang et.al., [2511.15654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15654v1)

 The JUNO experiment has recently released its first measurement results based on 59.1 days of data, achieving unprecedented precision in measuring the lepton mixing angle $θ\_{12}$. This significant improvement places stringent constraints on certain neutrino mass models and flavor mixing patterns. In this work, we examine the impact of the latest JUNO results on the two trimaximal (i.e., TM1 and TM2) mixing patterns. They are two well-motivated variants of the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern and predict specific correlations between $θ\_{12}$ and $θ\_{13}$, which lie outside the experimentally allowed $1σ$ and $3σ$ regions, respectively, after taking into account JUNO's results. Then, attempting to reconcile these TM mixing patterns with the latest experimental data, we further investigate the renormalization group (RG) running effects on them in the both Majorana and Dirac neutrino cases. Our analytical and numerical results show that RG corrections can bring the two TM mixing patterns into excellent agreement with the latest JUNO data if neutrino masses are quasi-degenerate. However, the Majorana case faces severe constraints from neutrinoless double beta decay limits, and particularly, the TM2 mixing pattern with Majorana neutrinos has been essentially ruled out. In the Dirac case, the TM1 mixing pattern is fully consistent with current data including beta decay results, whereas the TM2 pattern is strongly constrained by the KATRIN limit and even could be largely ruled out if the KATRIN experiment reaches its final sensitivity without any discovery. Future high-precision measurements of lepton mixing parameters and absolute neutrino masses in both oscillation and non-oscillation experiments will provide decisive tests of these mixing patterns.

2025-11-19, **The data processing system of the POEMMA-Balloon with Radio mission**, Valentina Scotti et.al., [2511.15644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15644v1)

 The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) mission incorporates an advanced data processing system (DP) to enable the detection and characterization of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and astrophysical neutrinos. The data acquisition (DAQ) system integrates inputs from the Cherenkov Camera, the Fluorescence Camera, the Radio Instrument and the X-Gamma detectors, ensuring synchronized event detection. Built upon the heritage of the EUSO-SPB2 DAQ architecture, the system has been adapted to support both the hybrid focal surface and radio instrumentation.   The DP features two redundant CPUs, differential GPS receivers, and environmental monitoring capabilities, including temperature, humidity, and gyroscope-based orientation tracking. A central clock board synchronizes data collection across all instruments, ensuring precise event reconstruction. The main trigger and clock board manages trigger signals from different detectors, supporting both joint and independent data acquisition modes. These advancements enhance the mission's contribution to multi-messenger astrophysics and provide valuable insights for future space-based observatories.   In this paper, we describe the system's main components and the design developed for this new mission.

2025-11-19, **The Cherenkov Camera for the PBR mission**, Valentina Scotti et.al., [2511.15636v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15636v1)

 The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) mission is a NASA super-pressure balloon experiment designed to advance the detection of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, high-altitude horizontal air showers, and astrophysical neutrinos. A key instrument of PBR is the Cherenkov Camera (CC), which utilizes a 2048-pixel SiPM camera to detect the optical Cherenkov emission from cosmic-ray-induced air showers and search for upward-going signals indicative of neutrinos.   The CC operates in the 320-900 nm spectral range with a 10 ns integration time, leveraging a bi-focal optical design to enhance detection efficiency. The CC enables precise reconstruction of shower trajectories and provides valuable data on cosmic rays' composition and energy distribution. PBR's sub-orbital altitude is particularly advantageous for these measurements, offering a unique vantage point that bridges the observational gap between ground-based and space-based instruments. Additionally, the CC will play a critical role in neutrino searches, detecting tau-lepton decay showers from Earth-skimming neutrinos associated with astrophysical transients. By integrating the CC with fluorescence and radio detection systems, PBR will pioneer a multi-messenger approach to high-energy cosmic phenomena, refining observational techniques for future space-based missions.   This contribution will describe the current status of the development of the CC as well as its expected performance.

2025-11-19, **Measurements of $ZZ \rightarrow \ell\ellνν$ and $ZZjj \rightarrow \ell\ellννjj$ productions in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector**, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., [2511.15569v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15569v1)

 This article presents measurements of $Z$ boson pair production cross-sections at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton data collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis includes both inclusive $ZZ$ production and $ZZ$ production in association with two jets ($ZZjj$), where one $Z$ boson decays into a pair of charged leptons $\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell = e, μ$), and the other decays into a neutrino pair. The measured fiducial cross-section of the inclusive $ZZ$ production is $21.0\pm1.0$ fb, while for the $ZZjj$ production it is $0.96^{+0.18}\_{-0.16}$ fb. Extrapolation of the $ZZ$ cross-section to the full phase space, for $Z$ bosons within the mass range $66-116$~GeV, yields $σ(pp \rightarrow ZZ) = 15.38\pm0.81$ pb. Differential cross-sections are presented for an extended set of kinematic observables. The results are found to be in good agreement with Standard Model predictions. Constraints on anomalous gauge boson self-interactions are derived using both the vertex function formalism and the effective field theory framework.

2025-11-19, **Excess of diffuse gamma-ray emission detected from the galaxy cluster Abell 119 from 14-year Fermi-LAT Data**, Gajanan D Harale et.al., [2511.15559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15559v1)

 Galaxy clusters are among the most massive gravitationally bound systems in the Universe and are considered major reservoirs of high-energy cosmic rays, yet no conclusive $γ$-ray detection from them has been achieved. This non-detection may stem from limited sensitivity and source localization of current $γ$-ray instruments, as well as strong interactions of $γ$-rays with intervening material that restrict detectable signals to only a few nearby and dynamically active clusters. Motivated by these constraints, we selected a sample of nearby ($z<0.05$) merging clusters and analyzed 14 years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data. In this work, we present a detailed study of Abell 119 (A119), a merging cluster with significant X-ray luminosity and complex dynamics. Using \textit{Fermipy} and \textit{Fermi} Science Tools, we modeled all potential $γ$-ray sources and confirmed the 4FGL point sources 4FGL J0059.3$-$0152, 4FGL J0101.0$-$0059, and 4FGL J0059.2+0006 with significant TS values.s. It further reveals, a $\sim4σ$ excess of diffuse $γ$-ray emission offset by $\sim0.25^\circ$ from the cluster center, plausibly associated with the cluster halo. An extended model provides the best fit, yielding luminosity bounds of $\sim 12.21^{+2.74}\_{-3.95}\times10^{42}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ and a particle spectral index of $\sim2.25^{+0.38}\_{-0.13}$, consistent with earlier expectations for cluster-scale non-thermal emission. These results suggest a hadronic origin for the detected signal. Although the $\sim4σ$ excess is compelling, uncertainties in localization and instrumental limitations prevent a definitive detection. Nonetheless, the results highlight the potential for deeper cluster studies, and the estimated neutrino flux $E^{2}φ\_ν\approx3\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$ motivates future observations with upcoming neutrino telescopes.

2025-11-19, **Probing unitarity violation of lepton flavor mixing matrix with reactor antineutrinos at JUNO and TAO**, Jihong Huang et.al., [2511.15525v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15525v1)

 Motivated by the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters at Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), we investigate the possibility of probing the unitarity violation of lepton flavor mixing matrix solely with reactor antineutrinos. First, we stress that it is necessary to reconsider the production and detection of neutrinos in a self-consistent way, apart from neutrino propagation, when analyzing experimental sensitivities to unitarity violation. Then, concentrating on JUNO and its satellite experiment Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO), we demonstrate how the event rates of inverse beta decays (i.e., $\overlineν^{}\_e + p \to e^+ + n$) for observing $\overlineν^{}\_e \to \overlineν^{}\_e$ oscillations, and those of elastic antineutrino-electron scattering (i.e., $\overlineν^{}\_α+ e^- \to \overlineν^{}\_α+ e^-$ with $α= e, μ, τ$) for $\overlineν^{}\_e \to \overlineν^{}\_μ$ and $\overlineν^{}\_e \to \overlineν^{}\_τ$ oscillations, depend on the parameters characterizing unitarity violation. Our investigation will be useful for JUNO and TAO to place independent constraints with more data in the near future.

2025-11-19, **Quantum field theory approach to neutrino oscillations in dark matter and implications at JUNO**, Wei Chao et.al., [2511.15494v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15494v2)

 Neutrino oscillation is a significant physical process worthy of in-depth exploration. In this paper, we investigate the matter effect of massive neutrinos in a scalar-type ultra-light dark matter and calculate the neutrino oscillation probability using the quantum field theory method. The result reveals that the neutrino oscillation probability derived from the quantum field theory approach exhibits no additional time dependence, which marks the most significant distinction from the oscillation result obtained through the quantum mechanics method. Furthermore, we discuss predictions of the Juno experiment regarding neutrino oscillation behavior in scalar-type ultra-light dark matter. This study extends the understanding of the interaction between neutrinos and dark matter, which warrants further exploration.

2025-11-19, **CP Prediction from Residual $\mathbb Z_2^s$ and $\overline{\mathbb Z}_2^s$ Symmetries with JUNO First Data**, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., [2511.15442v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15442v1)

 The JUNO first data and the recent neutrino global fit results are implemented in the sum rule from the residual $\mathbb Z^s\_2$ and $\overline{\mathbb Z}^s\_2$ symmetries to make prediction of the leptonic Dirac CP phase $δ\_D$. Without involving model parameters, the probability distribution of $δ\_D$ can be readily obtained from the experimental measurements of the three mixing angles. We then confront the theoretical predictions with the global fit results for the CP phase as well as the T2K and NOvA joint analysis for their CP measurement to give the data preference of the two residual symmetries with Bayes factor for both normal and inverted orderings. We further extend our analysis to a two-dimensional probability distribution to fully explore the correlation between the CP phase $δ\_D$ and the atmospheric angle $θ\_a \equiv θ\_{23}$.

2025-11-19, **21 cm Cosmology Sensitivity to Small-Scale Structure: Warm vs Neutrino-Interacting Dark Matter**, Virgile Dandoy et.al., [2511.15430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15430v1)

 The $21\,$cm signal originating from Cosmic Dawn to the Epoch of Reionisation is highly sensitive to the processes governing star formation in the early universe as well as new physics. In this work, we focus on the imprint of non-cold dark matter (DM), which impacts the formation of the smallest halos. Our goal in particular is to clarify whether near-future radio telescopes such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA), will be able to distinguish between free-streaming dark matter, specifically in the form of thermal warm DM (WDM), and collisional damping due to neutrino-DM ($ν$DM) interactions giving rise to larger overdensities on small scales. For that purpose we first implement a mapping between the two models in terms of a cutoff scale and determine detection thresholds for the two DM models. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we show that $ν$DM interaction strengths down to $σ\_{ν{\rm DM}}\sim 3\times10^{-35}$ cm$^2$ could be probed by $21\,$cm cosmology when considering two populations of galaxies for a GeV mass DM. This would allow to either confirm or rule out a recent claimed preference for a non-zero $ν$DM interaction in Lyman-$α$ data. Furthermore, we find that HERA will not be able to distinguish between $ν$DM and WDM. In the latter context, the threshold for detection of $ν$DM interactions translates into WDM with mass up to $m\_{\rm WDM}\sim 9$ keV that could be detected by HERA.

2025-11-19, **Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in Light of JUNO First Data**, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., [2511.15391v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15391v1)

 The first results from the JUNO reactor neutrino oscillation experiment improve our knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing parameters, especially the solar angle $θ\_s \equiv θ\_{12}$ and the solar mass squared difference $Δm^2\_s \equiv Δm^2\_{21}$. We discuss the implications of these results on neutrinoless double beta decay by itself and in combination with the global fit of neutrino oscillation experiments, the JUNO first data, and cosmological constraints on the neutrino mass sum. For the effective mass $\langle m\_{ee} \rangle$, the uncertainties in its lower limits for both mass orderings and upper limits for the normal ordering are largely reduced. Since the cosmological CMB and DESI BAO data put a stringent constraint on the neutrino mass scale, we also show how the probability distribution of both the real and imaginary parts of the effective mass $\langle m\_{ee} \rangle$ on the complex plane is affected. Especially, the funnel region with $\|\langle m\_{ee} \rangle\| \lesssim 1$\,meV receives larger chance to happen. Correspondingly, the chance of determining the two Majorana CP phases simultaneously in this region also increases with reduced uncertainty.

2025-11-19, **Origin of Galaxies**, Nikolaos Samaras et.al., [2511.15325v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15325v1)

 Milgromian Dynamics (MOND) has been particularly successful in predicting scaling relations for galactic systems, namely the baryonic Tully-Fisher for spirals, the Faber-Jackson for ellipticals and the Radial Acceleration Relation for late-type galaxies. Its essential tenet is the modification of the gravity law at low accelerations. Nevertheless, despite MOND's passed tests, the puzzle of the missing mass on galaxy clusters' scales still persists. One proposed scenario to complete this deficit and apply it further to cosmology is the so-called $ν$HDM model. It is composed of a sterile neutrino and the MOND gravity. In this Ph.D. thesis, I have put forward this cosmological idea, conducting hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the $ν$HDM structure formation. In the debut attempt, the $ν$HDM model was proven capable of reproducing the $Λ$CDM cosmology, imitating the same expansion history ($Ω\_m \approx$ 0.3 and $H\_0 \approx$ 67.6 km/s/Mpc), reproducing the CMB phenomenology, while the cosmic web is nicely formed. In the next step, I have optimized the $ν$HDM model using Bayesian statistics, re-branding it to opt-$ν$HDM. I managed to optimally fit the angular power spectrum of the CMB calculated by \textit{Planck}, except its fourth peak, but the opt-$ν$HDM cosmological parameters changed significantly with respect to its precursor, resulting in a much heavier cosmos, with $Ω\_m \approx$ 0.5 and $H\_0 \approx$ 55.6 km/s/Mpc. Next, I explore the opt-$ν$HDM expansion history, its structure formation and the resulting mass function. The appearance of the early-time structures, firstly in the $ν$HDM model, as well as in the opt-$ν$HDM model occurs quiet late, at $z\approx4$ and at $z\approx 5.5$, respectively. Although the resolution has improved from previous studies, the $ν$HDM variants cannot explain easily the high-redshift galaxies, observed by JWST.

2025-11-19, **Divergence in tracing the flavors of astrophysical neutrinos: can JUNO help IceCube?**, Zhi-zhong Xing et.al., [2511.15127v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15127v1)

 We derive the flavor fractions $(η^{}\_e , η^{}\_μ, η^{}\_τ)$ for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}\_e , f^{}\_μ, f^{}\_τ)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and find that a potential divergence may appear in inferring the values of $η^{}\_μ$ and $η^{}\_τ$ as an unavoidable consequence of the approximate $μ$-$τ$ interchange symmetry of lepton flavor mixing. We illustrate such an effect by applying our formula to the IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the naive assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We show that only $η^{}\_e$ and $η^{}\_μ+ η^{}\_τ$ can be extracted from the measurements of $f^{}\_e$, $f^{}\_μ$ and $f^{}\_τ$ if the $μ$-$τ$ flavor symmetry is exact, and the JUNO and Daya Bay precision antineutrino oscillation data will help a lot in this connection.

2025-11-19, **Large-Width New Physics at Colliders: A Gauge-Invariant Resummation Approach**, Yin-Fa Shen et.al., [2511.15114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15114v1)

 Broad resonances challenge the standard Monte-Carlo treatment of unstable particles, which introduces a Breit-Wigner width into leading-order matrix elements and can generate unphysical gauge artifacts. We develop a gauge-consistent framework that combines a Dyson-resummed propagator with Slavnov-Taylor-identity-implied resummed vertices, enabling a consistent implementation in MadGraph5. In the Type-I seesaw model, heavy Majorana neutrinos naturally satisfy $Γ\sim m$, leading to strong departures from the Breit-Wigner lineshape, distorted angular correlations, and significant modifications to both $s$- and $t$-channel dynamics. Comparing with the normal and complex-mass schemes, we find that standard treatments can substantially misestimate cross sections and kinematic distributions in the large-width regime. Our results show that existing collider limits on heavy neutrinos-and, more generally, on any broad resonance-should be revisited within a fully resummed framework, opening new opportunities for both experimental searches and theoretical model building.

2025-11-19, **Modified TM2 for Reproducing All Best-Fit Values of Neutrino Mixing Angles**, Michael Fodroci et.al., [2511.15111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15111v1)

 As measurements of neutrino mixing angles continue to become more precise, it is increasingly likely that in the very near future a realistic neutrino mixing model will be required to precisely reproduce their best-fit values. In this study, a modified TM$\_2$ mixing model which reproduces the best-fit values of all three neutrino mixing angles is proposed. The model reproduces the correct mixing angles within 1$σ$ of the current central values and is robust against any future changes of the best-fit values.

 Models in which a subcomponent of dark matter interacts with dark radiation have been proposed as a solution to the Hubble tension. In this framework, the interacting subcomponent of dark matter is in thermal equilibrium with the dark radiation in the early universe, but decouples from it around the time of matter-radiation equality. We study this general class of models and evaluate the quality of fit to recent cosmological data on the cosmic microwave background (from Planck 2018 and ACT DR6), baryon acoustic oscillations, large-scale structure, supernovae type Ia, and Cepheid variables. We focus on three benchmark scenarios that differ in the rate at which the dark matter decouples from the dark radiation, resulting in different patterns of dark acoustic oscillations. Fitting without ACT DR6 data, we find that all three scenarios significantly reduce the Hubble tension relative to $Λ$CDM, with an exponentially fast decoupling being the most preferred. The tension is reduced to less than $2 \, σ$ in fits that don't include the SH0ES collaboration results as part of the data and to less than $1 \, σ$ when these are included. When ACT DR6 data is included, the fit is significantly worsened. We find that the largest $H\_0$ value at the $95 \%$ confidence region is $70.1$ km/s/Mpc without the SH0ES data, leading to only a mild reduction in the tension. This increases to $72.5$ km/s/Mpc, corresponding to a reduction in the tension to less than $3 \, σ$, if the SH0ES results are included in the fit.

 Ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axions and dark photons, are leading dark matter candidates. They may couple feebly to photons, sourcing oscillating electromagnetic signals in the presence of magnetic field. The Earth resonant cavity formed between the ground and the ionosphere provides a natural waveguide that can amplify such signals. We carry out a project aiming to search for new physics using the unshielded high-sensitivity atomic magnetometer, termed the Geomagnetic Probe for nEw physiCS (GPEX). In this work, we report our first search for axion and dark photon dark matter, conducted in the desert of XiaoDushan in Gansu Province, China. Analysis of the collection of one-hour data shows no evidence for axion- or dark photon-induced magnetic signals. Correspondingly, we set the constraints on the axion-photon coupling with $g\_{aγγ} < 7\times10^{-10}\, \mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ and the dark photon kinetic-mixing parameter $ε< 2\times10^{-6}$ in the mass range $3.5 \times 10^{-16}\, \mathrm{eV} \sim 1.8 \times 10^{-14}\, \mathrm{eV}$. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ground-based quantum magnetic sensors for ultralight dark matter searches. Future networks of such detectors operating over extended periods could further enhance sensitivity, approaching the limits set by astrophysical observations.

 We generalize thermal WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) freeze-out within Tsallis nonextensive statistics. Using Curado-Tsallis $q$-distributions $f\_q(E;μ,T)$ we compute $q$-deformed number and energy densities, pressure, entropy density and Hubble rate, $\{n\_q,ρ\_q,P\_q,s\_q,H\_q\}$. The Boltzmann equation is generalized accordingly to obtain the comoving abundance $Y\_{χ,q}(x)$ and relic density $Ω\_{χ,q}h^2$ for a dark-matter candidate $χ$ in a model-independent setup. The thermally averaged cross section is expanded as $\langleσv\rangle\_q \approx a + b\,\langle v\_{\rm rel}^2\rangle\_q$ up to $p$-wave. The freeze-out parameter $x\_f(q)$ is determined from $Γ\_{{\rm ann},q}(T\_f)\simeq H\_q(T\_f)$ using a $q$-logarithmic inversion, with the expansion rate modified through ultra-relativistic rescalings $R\_ρ(q)$ of the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $g\_*$ and $g\_{*s}$. We show that $x\_f$ increases with $q$ and that QCD-threshold features propagate into $Y\_{χ,q}(x)$ and $Ω\_{χ,q}h^2$. We then perform two $q$-grid scans: fixing $\langleσv\rangle\_q$ while varying the dark-matter mass $m\_χ$, and fixing $m\_χ$ while varying the $s$-wave coefficient $a$. For an $s$-wave dominated scenario we construct $χ^2$ profiles in these planes by comparing $Ω\_{χ,q}h^2$ with the Planck benchmark $Ω\_c h^2 = 0.120\pm 0.001$. In both cases we find a clear degeneracy in the preferred nonextensive parameter $q\_{\rm best}$ along valleys in parameter space. However, fixed-mass scans (varying $\langleσv\rangle\_q$) are significantly more constraining than fixed-cross-section scans, reflecting that $Ω\_{χ,q}h^2$ is mainly controlled by $\langleσv\rangle\_q$, so that for realistic cross sections the best-fit $q\_{\rm best}$ remains close to the extensive limit $q\to 1$.

 In the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model, sub-galactic structures hierarchically collide and merge to build up larger structures. Mergers and collisions between dwarf galaxies and dark matter subhaloes (DMSHs) play an important role in the evolution and formation of structures within a massive galaxy. We investigate the collision frequency between DMSHs associated with a massive host galaxy such as the Milky Way. We analytically estimate the density distribution of DMSH pairs for the relative distance and relative velocity ($r\_\mathrm{rel}$-$v\_\mathrm{rel}$) and the distance from the centre of the host halo and relative velocity ($r$-$v\_\mathrm{rel}$) planes, based on the distribution function of the host halo in the phase space. Then, we evaluate the collision frequencies of DMSHs by integrating the orbital evolution of DMSHs in Milky-Way-like host haloes selected from cosmological $N$-body simulations. The frequency of violent encounters, in which the relative distance of DMSHs is shorter than the sum of scale radii, is averaged as $2.1\times 10^2\,\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$. Since the time scale of violent encounters, $4.7\,\mathrm{Myr}$, is shorter than the dynamical time of the host halo, collisions between DMSHs occur frequently within the host halo. Although interactions between DMSHs produce pairs with higher relative velocities, the density distributions of all and colliding pairs between DMSHs provided by numerical results are approximately similar to those of the analytical model neglecting the interactions of DMSHs on $r\_\mathrm{rel}$-$v\_\mathrm{rel}$ plane for all pairs and $r$-$v\_\mathrm{rel}$ plane for colliding pairs. We compare our results with observed colliding dwarf galaxies and provide insight into the abundance of DMSHs.

 The SABRE (Sodium iodide with Active Background REjection) experiment aims to detect an annual rate modulation from dark matter interactions in ultra-high purity NaI(Tl) crystals which will provide a model independent test of the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA. SABRE will consist of two separate detectors in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. SABRE South will be located in the newly completed Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory (SUPL), the first deep underground laboratory in the southern hemisphere. The combination of SABRE North and South is intended to disentangle seasonal or site-related effects from the dark matter-like modulated signal. Measuring and understanding backgrounds is essential for the reliability and consistent performance of these searches, and as the first large detector in SUPL SABRE South will also be used to measure backgrounds from radiogenic and cosmogenic sources. The SABRE South veto system is designed to detect the signals generated by radiation and cosmic rays using a 12 kL linear alkyl-benzene (LAB) based liquid scintillator (LS) detector contained in a steel vessel and instrumented with 18 Hamamatsu R5912 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), alongside a plane of 8 plastic scintillator modules (instrumented with 2 R13089 PMTs) located above the vessel to reliably detect muons from cosmic-rays with a position resolution of 5 cm.

 SABRE aims to provide a test of the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA through two separate detectors that rely on joint ultra-high NaI(Tl) purity crystal R&D activities: SABRE South at SUPL Australia and SABRE North at LNGS Italy. SABRE South is designed to disentangle seasonal and site-related effects from the dark matter-like modulated signal. Ultra-high purity crystals are immersed in a liquid scintillator veto, further surrounded by passive shielding and a plastic scintillator muon veto. Significant work has been undertaken to assess and mitigate background from the detector materials, and to understand the performance of both the crystal and veto systems. SUPL is a newly built facility located 1024 m underground in Australia. SABRE South is currently being assembled and will be completed in 2025, with first subsystems already installed in SUPL. This proceedings will report on the general status of the SABRE South assembly, its expected performance, and the design of SUPL.

2025-11-20, **Composite Asymmetric Dark Matter from Primordial Black Holes**, Takumi Kuwahara et.al., [2511.16354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16354v1)

 We investigate a cogenesis scenario for composite asymmetric dark matter framework: a dark sector has a similar strong dynamics to quantum chromodynamics in the standard model, and the dark-sector counterpart of baryons is the dark matter candidate. The Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes plays the role of a source of heavy scalar particles whose $CP$-violating decay into quarks and dark quarks provides particle--anti-particle asymmetries in baryons and dark matter, respectively. Primordial black holes should evaporate after the electroweak phase transition and before the big-bang nucleosynthesis for explaining the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and for consistent cosmology. We find that this scenario explains the observed values for both baryon and dark matter energy densities when the heavy scalar particles have a mass of $10^6 \text{--} 10^9\, \mathrm{GeV}$ and the primordial black holes have masses of $10^7 \text{--} 10^9\,\mathrm{g}$.

2025-11-20, **Constraining interacting dark energy models with black hole superradiance**, Zhen-Hong Lyu et.al., [2511.16244v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16244v1)

 The recent preference for a dynamical dark energy (DE) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument seems to call for interactions between DE and dark matter (DM), either from direct DM-DE interaction or indirect interaction induced by modified gravity. Therefore, an independent probe for these kinds of DE-DM interactions would be appealing from observational aspects. In this paper, we propose the black hole superradiance as a novel astrophysical probe for field-theoretic interacting DE-DM models, providing complementary constraints independent of large-scale cosmological observations. The core principle is that the DE-DM interaction can alter the effective mass of the superradiant ultralight boson, thereby modifying its superradiant instability rate around spinning black holes. We explore this connection through two distinct scenarios: a model where the DE field mediates a dark fifth force within the DM sector, affecting the superradiance from DM particles; and a novel mechanism where the DE field itself becomes superradiant due to the effective mass enhancement induced by dense DM spikes around supermassive black holes. By applying a statistical framework to black hole observations in both scenarios, we derive constraints on the fundamental DE-DM coupling strength. Although the current constraints are rather loose due to small samples and inaccurate measurements, our work provides new astrophysical constraints on these interacting DE-DM scenarios and establishes a new synergy between black hole physics and cosmology for probing the fundamental nature of the dark sector.

2025-11-20, **Creation of Viscous Dark Energy by the Hubble Flow: Comparison with SNe Ia Master Sample Binned Data**, Iolanda Navonea et.al., [2511.16130v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16130v1)

 We study a cosmological model featuring evolutionary dark energy, according to the idea that the creation of its constituents arises from the gravitational field of the expanding universe, whose non-equilibrium physics is described by a non-zero bulk viscosity coefficient. This physical scenario calls for two additional parameters with respect to the ΛCDM model, one of which is the equation of state parameter of the created dark energy. The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the ΛCDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the ΛCDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.

2025-11-19, **Effects of New Forces on Scalar Dark Matter Solitons**, Alize Sucsuzer et.al., [2511.15916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15916v1)

 New long range forces acting on ordinary matter are highly constrained. However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest.

2025-11-19, **Mean Mass Density near the Sun from the Divergence Theorem and Pulsar Accelerations**, Thomas Donlon et.al., [2511.15865v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15865v1)

 We introduce a new, non-parametric method for estimating the mass enclosed within a sphere of arbitrary radius centered on the Sun. The method is based on the divergence theorem as applied to measurements of the line-of-sight accelerations of millisecond pulsars. We describe a procedure for inferring the mean mass density within a sphere of a given radius centered on the Sun and find results that are consistent with previous analyses. When combined with a model for the distribution of baryons, this provides the mean mass density of dark matter as a function of distance from the Sun, rather than a single value as is typically reported by kinematic studies. However, with the present pulsar data, the method cannot unambiguously measure a signal from the local distribution of dark matter at this time; such a measurement is expected to soon become possible as the amount of pulsar acceleration data grows and its precision improves. We derive an extension of the well-known shell theorem to a spherical-harmonics expansion of the density and potential, and use the result to obtain estimates for density asymmetries with respect to the Galactic midplane from the observed acceleration data. The predicted asymmetries do not follow the observed distribution of MW disk stars or gas; this can potentially be explained by a non-uniform distribution of dark matter in the Solar neighborhood.

2025-11-19, **DESI-Like Hubble Expansion From Staged Symmetry Breaking**, Zachary J. Hoelscher et.al., [2511.15851v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15851v1)

 The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release shows a moderate preference for dark energy with a time-varying equation of state parameter, suggesting that the standard $Λ$CDM model may need to be revised. In particular, DESI favors dark energy whose equation of state parameter can drop below $-1$, violating the null energy condition. Chen and Loeb have recently suggested that this violation may be avoided if a subcomponent of the dark matter possesses a time-dependent equation of state. In this work, we present a renormalizable realization of that idea, which can be regarded as a more natural effective field theory. We show that such a construction not only yields dark matter with a time-varying equation of state parameter, but also naturally produces a self-interacting dark matter candidate with a velocity-dependent cross section as a consequence of gauge invariance. The second feature is relevant for addressing tensions between $Λ$CDM and observations of small-scale structure, particularly the diversity of galactic rotation curves. Even if further study ultimately finds our fiducial model to be disfavored, this work is valuable for constraining the space of renormalizable, natural models that have the potential to realize the behavior desired by Chen and Loeb.

 Surface simulations are important for accurately modeling particle interactions in experiments where background contributions from surface contaminants can significantly affect detector performance. In rare event searches, such as dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, standard Geant4 simulations typically assume perfectly smooth surfaces, neglecting the microscopic roughness that exists in real materials. This simplification can lead to inaccurate predictions of energy deposition. To address this limitation, I developed SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library designed to simulate more realistic surface roughness based on experimentally measurable parameters. The code allows users to generate patches of simplified rough surface geometries across a wide range of scales - from square millimeters to square meters - while maintaining computational efficiency. SCoRe4 is open source and can be easily integrated into existing Geant4 setups. This work presents the structure, implementation, and example application of SCoRe4,as well as its potential use in improving the accuracy of background modeling in rare event physics.

2025-11-19, **Structure Formation with Dark Magnetohydrodynamics**, Pierce Giffin et.al., [2511.15810v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15810v1)

 Long-range interactions in the dark sector can give rise to collective plasma phenomena that are capable of modifying the evolution of dark matter halos. We present the first study of gravitational collapse in a secluded dark $U(1)\_D$ model using a magnetohydrodynamic description of the dark matter. We show that dark magnetic fields generate an anisotropic pressure that alters the Jeans scale and suppresses small-scale power in a direction-dependent manner. For a range of primordial magnetic spectral indices, this effect produces distinctive modifications to the linear matter power spectrum. We find that current observations cannot yet constrain viable dark magnetic fields, as CMB tensor modes mostly provide more stringent constraints. Nevertheless, forthcoming high-resolution probes of the matter power spectrum (CMB-HD lensing, HERA, and EDGES) will be able to test these predictions and are sensitive to dark charge-to-mass ratios in the range $10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}\lesssim q\_χ/m\_χ\lesssim 10^{-14}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$.

2025-11-19, **The abundance and properties of the lowest luminosity dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way: Insights from Semi-Analytic Models**, Niusha Ahvazi et.al., [2511.15808v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15808v1)

 We investigate the formation and observable properties of faint satellite galaxies (M$\_\rm V > -3$) in Milky Way-like halos using the semi-analytic galaxy formation model Galacticus. The ability of the smallest dark matter halos to form stars depends sensitively on the balance between gas cooling and reionization heating. To quantify how this balance shapes the abundance and properties of the faintest galaxies, we compare two model variants: a fiducial model that includes molecular hydrogen (H$\_2$) cooling and UV background radiation, and a No-H$\_2$ model with atomic cooling only. Both models reproduce the structural properties of brighter Milky Way satellites, but they diverge at the lowest luminosities in the hyper-faint regime. The fiducial model predicts a substantially larger population of such systems that are on average hosted in halos with lower peak masses and quenched earlier. Many of these predicted systems lie below current observational thresholds but are within reach of next-generation deep imaging surveys. The predicted size-luminosity distributions of both models overlap with the region occupied by recently discovered "ambiguous" systems, whose classification as galaxies or star clusters remains uncertain. Specifically, we find that hyper-faint satellites have line-of-sight velocity dispersions of $σ\_{\rm los} \sim 1-3$ km/s in the fiducial model, nearly an order of magnitude higher than expected for purely self-gravitating stellar systems of the same stellar mass. This distinction underscores the diagnostic power of precise kinematic measurements for determining whether ambiguous objects are dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies or star clusters, and highlights the importance of upcoming spectroscopic campaigns in resolving the nature of the faintest satellites.

2025-11-19, **Axiverse Baryogenesis**, Pouya Asadi et.al., [2511.15794v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15794v1)

 The QCD axion may offer a unified origin for the baryon asymmetry and dark matter through axiogenesis. However, in the minimal QCD axion scenario, axiogenesis either underproduces baryons or overproduces dark matter, and the required kinetic misalignment initial conditions are in tension with axion quality. In this \textit{Letter}, we demonstrate that the axiverse naturally resolves these tensions: the QCD axion emerges as a linear combination of multiple axion-like fields, evading the overclosure problem thanks to new dissipation channels , while introducing additional Peccei--Quinn symmetries that ensure a high quality QCD axion. We illustrate these points in a toy model with two axions. This framework predicts a rich phenomenology within experimental reach, including dark matter detection prospects, astrophysical signals, and collider signatures.

2025-11-19, **How Bright in Gravitational Waves are Millisecond Pulsars for the Galactic Center GeV Gamma-Ray Excess? A Systematic Study**, Ming-Yu Lei et.al., [2511.15793v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15793v1)

 The existence of dark matter (DM) is supported by various macroscopic observations, but its microscopic nature remains elusive. The Galactic Center GeV gamma-ray excess (GCE) has been a leading candidate signal for particle dark matter annihilation. However, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge provides the alternative explanation for the excess. Identifying these MSPs in electromagnetic bands is difficult due to source confusion, pulse broadening, and extinction. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a complementary probe: a steadily rotating, non-axisymmetric MSP emits a nearly monochromatic GW signal in the sensitive band of ground-based detectors, with amplitude set by its ellipticity. In this work, we systematically investigate the GW emission from the MSP population proposed to explain the GCE and its detectability with current and future detectors. We consider three major scenarios for the origin of ellipticity and model the population properties of these MSPs. We also consider both isolated MSPs and MSPs in binary systems, as well as Doppler effects in the detection. We find that while the signal is below the reach of current interferometers, next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) can detect a fraction of those MSPs, offering a novel test of the MSP interpretation of the GCE. Future directed searches toward the Galactic Center with continued improvements in sensitivities will either uncover this long-sought MSP population or place stringent limits on their ellipticities and abundance, with important implications for both the astrophysical and dark-matter interpretations of the GCE.

2025-11-19, **How light can ALP dark matter be?**, Kierthika Chathirathas et.al., [2511.15790v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15790v1)

 We assume axion-like particles (ALPs) to provide the full dark matter abundance and derive various lower bounds on the ALP mass. We contrast the post- and pre-inflationary symmetry breaking cases and present allowed regions in the plane of ALP mass and energy scale of inflation. For the post-inflationary case, we revisit bounds from isocurvature perturbations taking into account that, as suggested by simulations, axion radiation by cosmic strings during the scaling regime provides the dominant production mechanism of dark matter, obtaining significantly weaker limits than previously. Combining isocurvature, with constraints from black hole superradiance and free streaming, we find that the bound $m\_a \gtrsim 10^{-17}$ eV applies for most cases considered here. It can be potentially relaxed to $\sim 6\times 10^{-19}$ eV only in the post-inflationary case with a strongly temperature-dependent axion mass, subject to uncertainties on the axion emission spectrum. Significantly stronger bounds are obtained in the post-inflationary scenario from the non-observation of CMB tensor modes, which can be as strong as $m\_a > 5\times 10^{-7}$ eV for small reheating efficiencies, $ε\lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$.

2025-11-19, **Thermal Vacuum Model for Cosmology without Inflaton**, Robert Alicki et.al., [2511.15760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15760v1)

 The previously proposed modification of the standard (flat) inflationary $ΛCDM$ model in which the inflaton field(s) and ``dark energy" are replaced by the vacum in expanding Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker Universe is studied. The expanding joint vacuum of the all ingrediences of matter, including Standard Model particles and a dark matter sector, is treated as a thermal equilibrium state at temporal Gibbons-Hawking temperature, proportional to the Hubble parameter, and chemical potentials equal to particle masses. This theory provides not only the new mechanism of inflation and its graceful exit, but also explains acceleration of expansion for the late Universe. The formalism can be combined with the anomalous quantum gravity effects leading to a viable baryogenesis mechanism and certain bounds on dark matter particle masses and lifetimes.

2025-11-19, **Comment to Comment to Black Hole in Dehnen $\left(1,4,\frac{1}{2}\right)$ Dark Matter Halo: Exact Solution, Lensing, Light Ring, and Thermodynamics**, David Senjaya et.al., [2511.15748v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15748v1)

 The claim in \cite{Al-Badawi:2025ipr} that *"the errors in the foundational components (3) and (5) of Ref. [1] invalidate all subsequent analyses, numerical results, and physical interpretations that depend on them"* is **entirely unfounded**. This statement reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the typographical nature of the error and appears to be a misplaced critique originating from a competing author, rather than a substantive assessment of the results, which remain fully valid.

2025-11-19, **Effects of short-range correlations at high densities on neutron stars with and without DM content: role of the repulsive self-interaction**, Odilon Lourenço et.al., [2511.15693v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15693v1)

 In this work, we investigate how short-range correlations affect relativistic hadronic models at high densities, with direct consequences for the structure of neutron stars, both with and without dark matter content. Two versions of the model are examined: one with vector self-interactions up to second order ($ω\_0^2$) and another including a fourth-order term ($ω\_0^4$). We show that SRC tend to soften the equation of state when only the quadratic term is present, but produce a noticeable stiffening once the $ω\_0^4$ term is included. The corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solutions for pure neutron stars indicate that short-range correlations reduce the maximum mass in the first case but increase it in the second. Extending the analysis to stars containing a fermionic dark matter component, within the two-fluid formalism, we verify that the same features appear in the respective mass-radius diagrams. In particular, the decrease of the maximum mass with increasing dark matter fraction is partly compensated by the SRC effects in the hadronic sector for the model with the fourth-order term. In all cases, the resulting parametrizations are consistent with recent astrophysical constraints, including the joint NICER-XMM-Newton analyses of the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the gravitational-wave event GW190425.

 We investigate the constraints and phenomenology of a three Higgs doublet model (3HDM) with a $\Z2\times\Z2$ symmetry, featuring two inert scalar doublets that give rise to a two-component dark matter (DM) scenario. We analyze the model's vacuum structure, exploring the competition between different symmetry-breaking minima, and subject it to comprehensive theoretical and current experimental constraints. Our analysis reveals previously unexplored regions of parameter space with viable dark matter candidates. Notably, we identify scenarios where both DM particles contribute comparably to the observed relic density, offering distinctive experimental signatures that could guide future searches.

2025-11-19, **Dark Matter Realism: How Referential Semantics Restricts Realism in Contemporary Fundamental Physics**, Simon Allzén et.al., [2511.15484v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15484v1)

 Philosophers increasingly treat semantics as decisive for realism about dark matter. In this paper, I consider a recent proposal from Vaynberg (2024) anchored in the causal-descriptive theory of reference from Psillos (1999, 2012). I argue that the application of Psillos' general scientific realist framework in the local context of dark matter is misguided, partly because of the overlooked metaphysical commitments underpinning causal-descriptivism, and partly because the extension of 'dark matter' on this account includes entities we do not currently consider to be dark matter, and exclude entities that we currently consider could be dark matter. Furthermore, I argue that this discord between scientific realism and dark matter should be regarded endemic in contexts where empirical evidence is scarce: the semantic details required by the proposed scientific realism is dependent on canonical empirical confirmation, because it is against that background that scientific realism has been formulated and developed.

2025-11-19, **Detectability of axion-like dark matter for different time-delay interferometry combinations in space-based gravitational wave detectors**, Yong-Yong Liu et.al., [2511.15438v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15438v1)

 In the space-based gravitational wave detections, the axion-like dark matter would alter the polarization state of the laser link between spacecrafts due to the birefringence effect. However, current designs of space-based laser interferometer are insensitive to variations in the polarization angle. Thus, the additional wave plates are employed to enable the response of the axion-induced birefringence effect. We calculate and compare the sensitivities of different space-based detectors, accounting for three time-delay interferometry combinations, including Monitor, Beacon, and Relay. We find that the Monitor and Beacon combinations have better sensitivity in the high-frequency range, and the optimal sensitivity reaches $g\_{aγ}\sim 10^{-13}\text{GeV}^{-1}$, while the Sagnac combination is superior in the low-frequency range. We also find that ASTROD-GW can cover the detection range of axion-like dark matter mass down to $10^{-20}\text{eV}$.

 We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a universe described by Lyra's geometry in the presence of dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). Dark energy is modeled as a quintessence scalar field with bulk viscosity, while dark matter is allowed to interact with the scalar sector. The displacement vector field, arising naturally in Lyra's manifold, provides an additional geometric contribution. By employing dynamical system techniques, we analyze stability properties and late-time attractors. Our results indicate that viscosity and DE--DM interaction enrich the phase space structure and can help address both the cosmic acceleration and the coincidence problem. Furthermore, by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with recent observational datasets, we derive best-fit values for the model parameters that exhibit good consistency with current data.

 We present an efficient estimator for higher-order galaxy clustering using small groups of nearby galaxies, or multiplets. Using the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2, we identify galaxy multiplets as discrete objects and measure their cross-correlations with the general galaxy field. Our results show that the multiplets exhibit stronger clustering bias as they trace more massive dark matter halos than individual galaxies. When comparing the observed clustering statistics with the mock catalogs generated from the N-body simulation AbacusSummit, we find that the mocks underpredict multiplet clustering despite reproducing the galaxy two-point auto-correlation reasonably well. This discrepancy indicates that the standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model is insufficient to describe the properties of galaxy multiplets, revealing the greater constraining power of this higher-order statistic on galaxy-halo connection and the possibility that multiplets are specific to additional assembly bias. We demonstrate that incorporating secondary biases into the HOD model improves agreement with the observed multiplet statistics, specifically by allowing galaxies to preferentially occupy halos in denser environments. Our results highlight the potential of utilizing multiplet clustering, beyond traditional two-point correlation measurements, to break degeneracies in models describing the galaxy-dark matter connection.

2025-11-19, **The effects of dark energy on the matter-gravity coupling**, Antonio Enea Romano et.al., [2511.15049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15049v1)

 Dark energy perturbations are expected to modify the evolution of cosmological perturbations, producing observable effects on scalar perturbations and gravitational waves. We show that the effects of dark energy for a generic modified gravity model can be encoded in a momentum, space and polarization dependent effective matter-gravity coupling, in agreement with the results obtained in some specific theories, and that this is not just related to the effective Planck mass appearing in the action as a coefficient of the Ricci's scalar. Using appropriately defined effective energy tensors, we show that the method can be extended to include also the effects of higher order perturbations. The generality of this effective description of the effects of dark energy on cosmological perturbations gives a solid theoretical justification for the phenomenological approaches often used in the analysis of cosmological observations, allowing to understand the mapping between the results of phenomenological analysis of observational data and theoretical models. The momentum and polarization dependence of the effective gravitational coupling implies that the gravitational energy emitted by a binary coalescence can have an additional frequency and polarization dependence, due to the effects of dark energy perturbations.

 Building upon previous work that derived an alternative to (galactic) dark matter in the form of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), with a specific theoretical interpolating function, from the motion of a non-relativistic test particle in the gravitational field of a point mass immersed in the non-relativistic static limit of the spin connection foam -- which represents the quantum analogue of Minkowski spacetime within precanonical quantum gravity -- we now show the consequences of using higher moments (third and fourth) of the corresponding geodesic equation with a random spin connection term. These higher moments lead to more general quantum modifications of the Newtonian potential (qMOND potentials expressed in terms of Gauss and Appell hypergeometric functions), more general (steeper) MOND interpolating functions, and a new modification of MOND at low accelerations (mMOND) that features an almost-flat asymptotic rotation curve $\propto r^{-1/18}$, which is expected to operate at approximately the same galactic scales as MOND.

 FQ Cir was an ordinary fast He/N classical nova, peaking at $V$=10.9. The pre-eruption and post-eruption counterpart was at $V$=14.0, making the smallest known classical nova amplitude of 3.1 mag. The nova light and the counterpart coincide to 0.034 arc-seconds, and the counterpart is a rare hot/blue emission-line star with flickering, so the identification of the quiescent nova is certain. The counterpart is a weak Be main sequence star, B1 V(n)(e). A coherent photometric period appears in all four {\it TESS} Sectors and in the AAVSO post-eruption light curve, as ellipsoidal modulation with orbital period 2.041738 days. The companion must have been spun-up to a fast rotation, and like all Be stars, a decretion disk is exuded. With the constraints of the blackbody radius and the main sequence, the companion mass is 13.0$^{+0.2}\_{-0.5}$ $M\_{\odot}$, with radius 6.2$\pm$0.2 $R\_{\odot}$. This is the discovery of a cataclysmic variable with a high-mass companion, a new class that we call `High Mass Cataclysmic Variables'. The white dwarf mass is 1.25$\pm$0.10 $M\_{\odot}$ and must have an accretion disk that supplies fuel for the nova eruption. FQ Cir represents a new mode of accretion in interacting binaries, with Roche lobe overflow from the decretion disk feeding mass into the usual accretion disk around the white dwarf, for disk-to-disk accretion. From the mass budget of the binary, the primary star must have its initial mass $>$7.6 $M\_{\odot}$, forming an ONe white dwarf, so FQ Cir can never become a Type Ia supernova.

2025-11-20, **Dark Matter-Dark Radiation Interactions and the Hubble Tension**, Manuel A. Buen-Abad et.al., [2511.16554v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16554v1)

 Models in which a subcomponent of dark matter interacts with dark radiation have been proposed as a solution to the Hubble tension. In this framework, the interacting subcomponent of dark matter is in thermal equilibrium with the dark radiation in the early universe, but decouples from it around the time of matter-radiation equality. We study this general class of models and evaluate the quality of fit to recent cosmological data on the cosmic microwave background (from Planck 2018 and ACT DR6), baryon acoustic oscillations, large-scale structure, supernovae type Ia, and Cepheid variables. We focus on three benchmark scenarios that differ in the rate at which the dark matter decouples from the dark radiation, resulting in different patterns of dark acoustic oscillations. Fitting without ACT DR6 data, we find that all three scenarios significantly reduce the Hubble tension relative to $Λ$CDM, with an exponentially fast decoupling being the most preferred. The tension is reduced to less than $2 \, σ$ in fits that don't include the SH0ES collaboration results as part of the data and to less than $1 \, σ$ when these are included. When ACT DR6 data is included, the fit is significantly worsened. We find that the largest $H\_0$ value at the $95 \%$ confidence region is $70.1$ km/s/Mpc without the SH0ES data, leading to only a mild reduction in the tension. This increases to $72.5$ km/s/Mpc, corresponding to a reduction in the tension to less than $3 \, σ$, if the SH0ES results are included in the fit.

2025-11-20, **Tracing Early Cosmic Chemical Enrichment: A Uniform XMM-Newton Survey of Metallicity in Galaxy Groups and Clusters**, Anne E Blackwell et.al., [2511.16448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16448v1)

 Observed metal abundances in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy groups and clusters, $Z\_{ICM}$, exceed what is expected from present-day stellar populations alone. Galaxy clusters are presumed to be near closed-box systems, allowing constraints to be placed on the origins of metals and stellar populations responsible for $Z\_{ICM}$. We present a uniform XMM-Newton survey of 26 galaxy groups and clusters, measuring radial metallicity profiles and relating $Z\_{ICM}$ with the stellar fraction $M\_*/M\_{gas}$. We determine $Z\_{ICM}$ via spectral fitting across multiple annuli finding a best fit of $Z\_{ICM} = -0.08^{+0.07}\_{-0.07}\, log\left(\frac{M\_*}{M\_{gas}}\right) + 0.30^{+0.06}\_{-0.06}$ with intrinsic scatter $σ\_p = 0.09^{+0.02}\_{-0.01}$. We use closed-box chemical evolution models to estimate the metallicity yield from observable stellar populations, incorporating updated supernova yields and corrections for metals locked in remnants, $Z\_* = (1.14 \pm 0.52) \, log\left(1 + \frac{M\_*}{M\_{gas}}\right)$. Our results demonstrate that present-day stellar populations systematically underpredict $Z\_{ICM}$, with an inferred excess component increasing in systems with low $M\_*/M\_{gas}$. This trend supports the need for an early enrichment population (EEP) distinct from visible stars, $Z\_{EEP}$. We find this necessity holds when reconsidering the closed-box assumption by removing all galaxy groups, potential leaky systems, deriving $Z\_{EEP}$ within $1σ$ when including and excluding groups. Three systems (NGC1132, NGC5098, and NGC4325) deviate from the survey trend, exhibiting steep negative radial metallicity gradients and unusually low $Z\_{ICM}$. We posit these systems to be late-forming whose ICM enrichment reflects only recent stellar populations. Our analysis quantifies the necessity of an EEP and provides trends for testing cluster chemical evolution models.

2025-11-20, **Creation of Viscous Dark Energy by the Hubble Flow: Comparison with SNe Ia Master Sample Binned Data**, Iolanda Navonea et.al., [2511.16130v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16130v1)

 We study a cosmological model featuring evolutionary dark energy, according to the idea that the creation of its constituents arises from the gravitational field of the expanding universe, whose non-equilibrium physics is described by a non-zero bulk viscosity coefficient. This physical scenario calls for two additional parameters with respect to the ΛCDM model, one of which is the equation of state parameter of the created dark energy. The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the ΛCDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the ΛCDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.

2025-11-20, **Formation of Extremely Low-Mass White Dwarfs in Wide Orbits**, Yangyang Zhang et.al., [2511.15993v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15993v1)

 Helium white dwarfs (WDs) with masses less than 0.3 $\rm M\_{\sun}$ are known as extremely low-mass WDs (ELM WDs), which cannot be produced by single stellar evolution in theory. Generally, these stars are believed to form through binary interactions. Recently, two ELM WDs in unusually wide orbits were reported, i.e., KIC 8145411 and HE 0430-2457. Their orbital separations are too wide to be produced by the binary evolution scenario. In this work, we study the formation of wide-orbit ELM WD binaries from hierarchical triple systems. In this scenario, an ELM WD is formed from the inner binary and subsequently forms a wide binary system with the third object. We find that the merger of an evolved star with a brown dwarf in the inner binary fails to produce single ELM WDs, but Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) explosions can successfully do so. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the supernova explosion on the orbital distribution of the surviving binary and find that this channel may have a probability of reproducing the orbital parameters of HE 0430-2457, but fails to reproduce the observed features of KIC 8145411. This supports recent observational recalibrations suggesting that KIC 8145411 resides in a triple system rather than a binary.

 Shock breakout and, in some cases, jet-driven high-energy emission are increasingly recognized as key signatures of the earliest phases of core-collapse supernovae, especially in Type IIn systems due to their dense, interaction-dominated circumstellar environments. We present a comprehensive photometric analysis of SN 2019vxm, a long-duration, luminous Type IIn supernova, $M\_V^{}=-21.41\pm0.05\;{\rm mag}$, observed from X-ray to near-infrared. SN 2019vxm is the first superluminous supernovae Type IIn to be caught with well-sampled TESS photometric data on the rise and has a convincing coincident X-ray source at the time of first light. The high-cadence TESS light curve captures the early-time rise, which is well described by a broken power law with an index of $n=1.41\pm0.04$, significantly shallower than the canonical $n=2$ behavior. From this, we constrain the time of first light to within 7.2 hours. We identify a spatial and temporal coincidence between SN 2019vxm and the X-ray transient GRB191117A, corresponding to a $3.3σ$ association confidence. Both the short-duration X-ray event and the lightcurve modeling are consistent with shock breakout into a dense, asymmetric circumstellar medium, indicative of a massive, compact progenitor such as a luminous blue variable transitioning to Wolf-Rayet phase embedded in a clumpy, asymmetric environment.

2025-11-19, **Post-Supernova Accretion of Light Elements onto a New-Born Neutron Star and NS 1987A**, Natalia de Jesús Baz-Pérez et.al., [2511.15913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15913v1)

 We model early accretion of light elements, He, C, and O, onto a new-born neutron star using the public stellar evolution code MESA, simulating what may happen during the first few years of its life. We find that, under the appropriate conditions, significant amounts of these elements can be accreted up to densities of 10^9 g/cc without triggering a nuclear explosion that would convert them into heavy elements. These results help to understand observations that favor light elements in the atmospheres of young cooling neutron stars, as the one found in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, and also add support to the recent indications for the presence of a neutron star, NS 1987A, in the remnant of SN 1987A.

 The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) provides critical insights into the role of early galaxies in shaping the ionization state of the universe. However, because of the opacity of the intergalactic medium, it is often not possible to make direct measurements of the ionizing photon escape fraction ($f\_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\: \mathrm{LyC}}$) of high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$) galaxies. To explore the agreement and systematics of common indirect approaches, we applied six empirically calibrated diagnostics to predict $f\_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\: \mathrm{LyC}}$ for the 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY). These methods- based on ultraviolet (UV) absorption lines, the UV continuum slope, Ly$α$ kinematics, a multivariate model, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, and nebular emission line ratios- enable us to explore systematic differences between predictions and assess how galactic properties influence inferred LyC escape. Despite significant variations in method predictions, there is broad consistency in the resulting weak and strong LyC leaker classifications, with approximately half exhibiting predicted escape fractions $>$1%. We find evidence for two different pathways of LyC escape in nearby star-forming galaxies: (1) an early escape model driven by very young stellar populations, and (2) a delayed escape model that is consistent with supernova-driven outflows and time-dependent ISM clearing. The early escape model is favored among galaxies with a single, intense burst of recent star formation. In contrast, the delayed escape model is common among galaxies with more extended starburst histories. To interpret ionizing photon escape during the EoR, it will be necessary to recognize and understand this diversity in LyC escape mechanisms.

2025-11-19, **Observational constraints on the product of dark energy chemical potential and number density in out-of-equilibrium models**, J. M. Costa Netto et.al., [2511.15828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15828v1)

 In this work, we impose observational limits on the product of dark energy chemical potential, $μ$, and number density, $n$, at the present time in out-of-equilibrium models, considering that particles can be created or destroyed in the fluid at a rate $Γ=3αH(a)$, where $α$ is a constant and $H(a)\equiv\dot{a}/a$ is the Hubble parameter. We combine the bounds derived from the positivity of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics with observational constraints on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) and Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) parameterizations of the equation of state (EoS) of the component. We use Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data from Pantheon+; baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2; and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements from Planck. For $α>0$ (particle creation), the thermodynamic restrictions yield only upper limits for the $μ\_{0}n\_{0}$ product, while in the case of $α<0$ (particle destruction) they establish both upper and lower limits, allowing for a range of values to be obtained. In both scenarios, however, we find that the chemical potential of dark energy must be negative, $μ<0$, which indicates a preference for the phantom regime. In particular, when $α<0$, it is noted that the thermodynamic bounds are simultaneously compatible only for very small absolute values of $α$, with $α=-0.0002$ being the limiting case and resulting in $μ\_{0}n\_{0}(α=-0.0002)=-2.2\_{-0.7}^{+1.0}\,\,GeV/m^{3}$.

2025-11-19, **Unveiling Chemical Enrichment in the Abell 2029 Core with XRISM, XMM-Newton, and Chandra**, Arnab Sarkar et.al., [2511.15809v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15809v1)

 We present new measurements of the chemical abundance pattern in the core of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell~2029, based on XRISM observations with Resolve (37 ks) and Xtend (500 ks), combined with archival data from XMM-Newton (EPIC, RGS) and Chandra. Fe abundances derived from Resolve, Xtend, and EPIC are broadly consistent, while RGS gives systematically lower values. Because the XRISM gate valve remained closed during these observations, Resolve spectral fitting is restricted to the 2--10 keV band, providing reliable constraints only for elements with strong lines in this band (S, Ar, Ca, Fe, Ni). Abundances of the $α$-elements are therefore derived using complementary observations from Xtend, EPIC, RGS, and Chandra. We construct an average X/Fe pattern in the cluster core by using Resolve exclusively for S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, and Ni/Fe, and RGS + Xtend for O/Fe. The Ne/Fe ratio is averaged from Xtend, EPIC, RGS, and Chandra measurements; Mg/Fe from EPIC and Chandra measurements; and Si/Fe from Xtend, EPIC, and Chandra. Comparison with the supernovae yield models indicates that the observed abundance pattern in A2029 core is best reproduced by a combination of core-collapsed yields from low-metallicity progenitors ($Z\_{\rm init}=0.001$) and a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass, double-degenerate Type Ia model. Additionally, we find an excess in Ca abundance in the core of A2029 that cannot be reproduced by the standard supernovae yield models.

 We investigate cosmological and astrophysical constraints on dark photons with masses $\sim 10^{-1}$-$10^3$ MeV. These dark photons can be copiously produced either in the early universe or during core-collapse supernovae, potentially leaving distinct observational signatures. First, we derive updated constraints from cosmological and astrophysical observables that rely on the thermal relic abundance of dark photons, including the CMB spectrum, primordial light element abundances, and galactic/extragalactic gamma-ray flux. We consider the minimal reheating temperature possible, $T\_{\rm RH} = 6 \, \rm MeV$, such that our constraints are conservative, but unavoidable within the minimal dark photon model. Then, for supernova-sourced dark photons, we systematically examine all relevant observational bounds, revisit the standard cooling argument and derive limits from other arguments such as fireball formation, low energy supernovae and galactic positron injection.

 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are challenging to identify due to their transient nature, complex temporal profiles, and limited observational datasets. We address this with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network integrated with an Adaptive Frequency Feature Enhancement module and physics-informed data augmentation. Our framework generates 100,000 synthetic GRB samples, expanding training data diversity and volume while preserving physical fidelity-especially for low-significance events. The model achieves 97.46% classification accuracy, outperforming all tested variants with conventional enhancement modules, highlighting enhanced domain-specific feature capture. Feature visualization shows model focuses on deep-seated morphological features and confirms the capability of extracting physically meaningful burst characteristics. Dimensionality reduction and clustering reveal GRBs with similar morphologies or progenitor origins cluster in the feature space, linking learned features to physical properties. This perhaps offers a novel diagnostic tool for identifying kilonova- and supernova-associated GRB candidates, establishing criteria to enhance multi-messenger early-warning systems. The framework aids current time-domain surveys, generalizes to other rare transients, and advances automated detection in large-volume observational data.

2025-11-19, **Explosions in the Empty: A Survey of Transients in Local Void Galaxies**, Suo-Ning Wang et.al., [2511.15401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15401v1)

 We present a systematic analysis of transient astrophysical events -- including supernovae (SNe), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- in void and non-void galaxies within the local universe ($0.005 < z < 0.05$). Cosmic voids, defined by low galaxy densities and characterized by minimal environmental interactions, offer a natural laboratory for isolating the impact of large-scale underdensities on stellar evolution and transient production. Using multi-wavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Catalogue, and high-energy space observatories, we compare transient occurrence rates and host galaxy properties across environments. We find that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are significantly more common in void galaxies, indicating that massive star formation remains active in underdense regions. In contrast, Type Ia supernovae are less frequent in voids, consistent with a scarcity of older stellar populations. Notably, we identify a short-duration GRB hosted by a void galaxy, demonstrating that compact object mergers can occur in isolated environments. Additionally, we find no FRBs associated with void galaxies. Taken together, these results show that cosmic voids exert a measurable influence on the star formation history of galaxies and hence on the production of transients.

2025-11-19, **Type Iax supernovae as a source of iron-rich silicate dust**, Aman Kumar et.al., [2511.15349v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15349v2)

 We model the formation of dust in the ejecta of Type Iax supernovae (SNe), which is a low-luminosity subclass of Type Ia SNe. A non-equilibrium chemical kinetic approach is adopted to trace the synthesis of molecules, molecular clusters, and dust grains in the ejecta of thermonuclear SNe. We find that Type Iax SNe provide conditions conducive to the formation of several O-rich dust species in the ejecta. Particularly, iron-rich silicates of chemical type FeSiO3, Fe2SiO4, and MgFeSiO4 are found to form in abundance, suggesting that the ejecta of low-luminosity thermonuclear SNe can be a site where a large fraction of iron is locked up in dust, unlike other stellar sources. The final mass of dust formed in the ejecta ranges between 10^{-5} and 10^{-4} Msun, where most of the dust forms between 1000 and 2000 days post-explosion. Apart from Fe-rich silicates, Mg-silicates, and silicon carbide are also formed in the ejecta of Type Iax SNe. When compared to the dust budget of typical Type Ia SNe, we find that the expected dust-to-ejecta mass ratio is one or two orders of magnitude larger in Type Iax SNe. We conclude that the ejecta of typical Type Ia SNe form a negligible amount of dust, in agreement with observation, while the low-luminosity subclass Type Iax SNe are potential producers of iron-rich silicates.
