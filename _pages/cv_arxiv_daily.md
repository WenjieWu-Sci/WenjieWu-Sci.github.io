2025-05-07, **Design, Fabrication, Characterization, and Testing of a Bias Supply Circuit for Silicon Photomultipliers**, Prajjalak Chattopadhyay et.al., [2505.04510v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04510v2)

 To assess the viability of a shallow-depth neutrino detector, a Cosmic Muon Veto Detector (CMVD) is being constructed on top of the stack of Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detectors at TIFR, Mumbai. The CMVD employs extruded plastic scintillators for muon detection, with wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for signal readout. A highly stable, low-noise power source is essential for biasing the SiPMs, as the precision, accuracy, and stability of the supply directly impact the consistency of their gain. To address this, we designed a biasing power supply capable of delivering 50-58 V in 50 mV steps, with a maximum short-circuit current output of 1 mA. The system incorporates digital voltage control, stabilization, and current monitoring, making it compatible with external controllers (such as microcontrollers). This added flexibility and modularity allow for additional functionalities, including temperature compensation. Designed to supply multiple SiPMs with close to breakdown voltages in parallel, the circuit seamlessly integrates with the front-end electronics of the detector system.

2025-05-07, **Measurement of reactor antineutrino oscillation at SNO+**, SNO+ Collaboration et.al., [2505.04469v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04469v1)

 The SNO+ collaboration reports its second spectral analysis of reactor antineutrino oscillation using 286 tonne-years of new data. The measured energies of reactor antineutrino candidates were fitted to obtain the second-most precise determination of the neutrino mass-squared difference $\Delta m^2\_{21}$ = ($7.96^{+0.48}\_{-0.42}$) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ eV$^2$. Constraining $\Delta m^2\_{21}$ and $\sin^2\theta\_{12}$ with measurements from long-baseline reactor antineutrino and solar neutrino experiments yields $\Delta m^2\_{21}$ = ($7.58^{+0.18}\_{-0.17}$) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ eV$^2$ and $\sin^2\theta\_{12} = 0.308 \pm 0.013$. This fit also yields a first measurement of the flux of geoneutrinos in the Western Hemisphere, with $73^{+47}\_{-43}$ TNU at SNO+.

2025-05-07, **Measurement of neutron production in atmospheric neutrino interactions at Super-Kamiokande**, Super-Kamiokande collaboration et.al., [2505.04409v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04409v1)

 We present measurements of total neutron production from atmospheric neutrino interactions in water, analyzed as a function of the electron-equivalent visible energy over a range of 30 MeV to 10 GeV. These results are based on 4,270 days of data collected by Super-Kamiokande, including 564 days with 0.011 wt\% gadolinium added to enhance neutron detection. The measurements are compared to predictions from neutrino event generators combined with various hadron-nucleus interaction models, which consist of an intranuclear cascade model and a nuclear de-excitation model. We observe significant variations in the predictions depending on the choice of hadron-nucleus interaction model. We discuss key factors that contribute to describing our data, such as in-medium effects in the intranuclear cascade and the accuracy of statistical evaporation modeling.

2025-05-07, **The ratio of $γ/ π^0$ production rates in neutrino-nucleus interactions at the $Δ$ resonance mass region**, Ara N. Ioannisian et.al., [2505.04332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04332v1)

 We study the dependence of neutrino-induced {\gamma}/$\pi^0$ production ($\stackrel{ {(-)}}{\nu\_\mu} + A \to \stackrel{ {(-)}}{\nu\_\mu}(\mu) +\gamma/\pi^0 + X$) on the target nucleus A, at the $\Delta$ resonance mass region. Our conclusion is based on experimental data for $\pi^0$ production rates at photon-nucleus interactions from the A2 collaboration at the Mainz MAMI accelerator. We assume that $\Delta$ resonance decays are independent of the production mechanism (via photon, Z, or W boson). In Neutral Current (NC) interactions, the $1\pi^0 + X$ production scales as A$^{2/3}$, reflecting the nuclear surface area. In contrast, photons from $\Delta$ decays typically escape the nucleus, resulting in a cross-section proportional to the atomic number A. Thus, in NC interactions, the ratio of {\gamma} production to $\pi^0$ production is proportional to A$^{1/3}$. In Charged Current (CC) $\nu\_\mu$($\bar \nu\_\mu$) -induced production of $\Delta^+$ ($\Delta^0$) will be proportional to the number of neutrons (protons) in the nucleus. After $\Delta$ decay, due to the charge universality in strong interactions, the suppression factor for $\pi^0$ escaping the nucleus must also follow A$^{-1/3}$, as in NC interactions. We predict the ratio of the ${\gamma} / \pi^0$ production rates in NC and CC interactions and for $\nu\_\mu$ and $\bar \nu\_\mu$ beams:   Argon target: ~3.1% (NC/CC $\nu\_\mu/\bar \nu\_\mu$)   Water target: ~1.9% (NC), ~2.3% (CC $\nu\_\mu$), ~1.7% (CC $\bar \nu\_\mu$)   Liquid Scintillator target: ~1.7% (NC), ~2.1% (CC $\nu\_\mu$), ~1.6% (CC $\bar \nu\_\mu$)   We also discuss solving the MiniBooNE anomaly by looking at the CC single photon and single neutral pion production rates at the SBN program experiments at Fermilab.

2025-05-07, **An exact parametrization of minimal seesaw model**, Zi-Qiang Chen et.al., [2505.04279v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04279v1)

 We propose a parametrization of neutrino masses and mixing in the minimal seesaw model (MSM). The MSM, which introduces two heavy sterile neutrinos, is the minimal extension of the Standard Model in addressing the tiny masses of active neutrinos. The parametrization includes 11 free parameters: 6 neutrino oscillation parameters (2 mass-squared differences $\Delta m^2\_{21}$, $\Delta m^2\_{31}$, 3 mixing angles $\theta\_{12}$, $\theta\_{13}$, $\theta\_{23}$, and 1 Dirac phase $\delta\_{\rm CP}$), 1 mass parameter in $0\nu2\beta$ decay $m\_{ee}$, and 4 additional parameters: 2 heavy neutrino masses $M\_1$ and $M\_2$, 1 active-sterile mixing angle $\theta\_{14}$ and 1 CP-violating phase $\delta\_{14}$. This parametrization is derived exactly from the most general neutrino mass matrix in the MSM without any approximation. We further discuss its implications in phenomenological studies.

2025-05-07, **J-PAS and PFS surveys in the era of dark energy and neutrino mass measurements**, Fuxing Qin et.al., [2505.04275v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04275v1)

 Fisher-matrix forecasts are presented for the cosmological surveys of the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) and the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). The wide, low-redshift coverage of J-PAS and the high-density, high-redshift mapping of PFS are strongly complementary: combining the two reduces marginalized uncertainties on all primary parameters compared with either survey individually. Adding the joint J-PAS+PFS data to next-generation CMB measurements from CMB-S4 and \textsc{LiteBird} yields an expected precision of $\sigma(\sum m\_\nu)=0.017\,$eV in the $\Lambda$CDM$+\sum m\_\nu+N\_{\rm eff}$ framework, sufficient to disfavour the inverted neutrino hierarchy at $2.35\,\sigma$ if the true mass sum equals the normal-ordering minimum. Motivated by recent DESI results, we also forecast within a $w\_0w\_a$CDM$+\sum m\_\nu+N\_{\rm eff}$ cosmology, adopting the DESI\,DR2 best-fit values ($w\_0=-0.758$, $w\_a=-0.82$) as fiducial. The combination CMB+J-PAS+PFS then delivers $\sigma(w\_0)=0.044$ and $\sigma(w\_a)=0.18$, corresponding to a $5.1\,\sigma$ preference for a time-varying dark-energy equation of state. These findings show that J-PAS and PFS, especially when coupled with Stage-IV CMB observations, will provide competitive tests of neutrino physics and the dynamics of cosmic acceleration.

2025-05-07, **Leptohadronic Multimessenger Modeling of Two High-redshift (z $>$ 1) Neutrino Emission Blazar Candidates**, Xiong Jiang et.al., [2505.04160v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04160v1)

 The blazars are one of the leading candidate sources of high-energy neutrinos. Recently, two blazars have been found to be temporally and spatially correlated with some IceCube high-energy neutrino events. The two blazars, GB6 J2113+1121 and NVSS J171822+423948, are Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) with redshifts greater than unity. In particular, NVSS J171822+423948 has a redshift of 2.7, which provides an important probe for studying the radiation processes of jets from active galactic nuclei in the early universe. To better understand the physical origin of the IceCube neutrinos, we adopt the one-zone leptohadronic model to fit the multimessenger emission of GB6 J2113+1121 and NVSS J171822+423948 during their $\gamma$-ray flaring periods and then calculate the high-energy neutrino detection probability. The chance of detecting a single muon neutrino from these two sources is found to be $\sim 2\%$ and $0.8\%$, respectively. Although such detection rates are not high mainly because of their high redshifts, our investigation strongly suggests that these sources are efficient PeV neutrino emitters. Our results also indicate that electromagnetic cascades produced by hadronic processes contribute significantly to X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emissions. However, high-energy $\gamma$-rays can be severely absorbed by the soft photon field from the broad-line region (BLR), which weakens the correlation between $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos, while suggesting a stronger connection between X-rays and neutrinos. We predict that IceCube will continue to detect neutrinos from FSRQs with redshifts greater than 1 in the future.

2025-05-07, **Neutrino-jet correlations in charged-current SIDIS**, Weihua Yang et.al., [2505.04093v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04093v1)

 Charged-current deep inelastic scattering plays a significant role in determining parton distribution functions with flavour separation. In this work, we present a systematic calculation of the charged-current semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) in the $eN$ collinear frame up to twist-3 level at leading order. Semi-inclusive refers to the process in which a jet is detected in addition to the scattered neutrino. We focus on neutrino-jet correlations in our calculation. We first present the differential cross section in terms of structure functions, followed by the differential cross section expressed in term of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions. We derive the complete set of azimuthal asymmetries and intrinsic asymmetries. We also introduce an observable $A^C$, defined as the ratio of the difference to the sum of differential cross sections for electron and positron semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. We notice that $A^C$ not only provides a sensitive probe for valence quark distribution functions but also can reveal the violation of strange-antistrange symmetry.

2025-05-07, **Testing Thermal-Relic Dark Matter with a Dark Photon Mediator**, Gordan Krnjaic et.al., [2505.04626v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04626v1)

 In light of recent DAMIC-M results, we present the status of thermal-relic dark matter $\chi$ coupled to a kinetically-mixed dark photon $A^\prime$. In the predictive "direct annihilation" regime, $m\_{A'} > m\_\chi$, the relic abundance depends on the kinetic mixing parameter, and there is a minimum value compatible with thermal freeze out. Using only electron and nuclear recoil direct detection results, we find that for complex scalar dark matter, the direct-annihilation regime is now excluded for nearly all values of $m\_\chi$; the only exception is the resonant annihilation regime where $m\_{A'}\approx 2 m\_\chi$. Direct annihilation relic targets for other representative models, including Majorana and Pseudo-Dirac candidates, remain viable across a wide range of model parameters, but will be tested with a combination of dedicated accelerator searches in the near future. In the opposite "secluded annihilation" regime, where $m\_\chi > m\_{A'}$, this scenario is excluded by cosmic microwave background measurements for all $m\_\chi \lesssim 30$ GeV. Similar conclusions in both the direct and secluded regimes hold for all anomaly-free vector mediators that couple to the first generation of electrically-charged Standard Model particles.

2025-05-07, **Axion Dark Matter Archaeology with Primordial Gravitational Waves**, Andrew Cheek et.al., [2505.04614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04614v1)

 We investigate the complementary information to be gained from inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) signals and searches for QCD axion dark matter. We focus on post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) breaking axion models that are cosmologically safe. Recent work has shown that a greater number of such models exist. This is because the heavy quarks required for the colour anomaly can provoke a period of heavy quark domination (HQD), which, through decay, dilutes the axion abundance. In this work we show for the first time that the axion dark matter mass can be as low as $m\_a\sim10^{-8}\,{\rm eV}$ for models where the heavy quarks decay via dimension 6 terms. This is achieved by allowing the mass of the heavy quarks to differ from the axion decay constant, $m\_Q\neq f\_a$. Consequently, the observables that would distinguish between pre- and post-inflationary PQ breaking, $m\_a$ and the additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N\_{\rm eff}$, now become indiscernible. To solve this, we propose using blue-tilted IGWs to probe HQD. By leveraging the features of the GW signal, future interferometers can probe $m\_Q$ and $f\_a$ complementing the sensitivity of haloscope experiments, potentially pinning down all relevant parameter that describe the physics. Specifically, we find that BBO and ET GW detectors will both be able to optimistically probe $f\_a\gtrsim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$.

2025-05-07, **I-Love-Q Relations of Fermion-Boson Stars**, Kelvin Ka-Ho Lam et.al., [2505.04605v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04605v1)

 We investigate the properties of fermion-boson stars (FBSs), which can be viewed as neutron stars with a bosonic dark matter (DM) admixture. A challenge in studying the impact of DM on neutron stars is the absence of a universally accepted nuclear-matter equation of state (EOS), making it difficult to distinguish between the effects of DM and various EOS models. To address this issue, we extend the study of the I-Love-Q universal relations of neutron stars to FBSs with a nonrotating bosonic component by solving the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system. We study how DM parameters, such as the boson particle mass and self-interaction strength, would affect the structure of FBSs and explore the parameter space that leads to deviations from the I-Love-Q relations. The properties of FBSs and the level of deviations in general depend sensitively on the DM parameters. For boson particle mass within the range of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-10} \ \mathrm{eV})$, where the Compton wavelength is comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of a $1 M\_\odot$ star, the deviation is up to about 5% level if the star contains a few percent of DM admixture. The deviation increases significantly with a higher amount of DM. We also find that the universal relations are still valid to within a 1% deviation level for boson particle mass $m\_b \geq 26.8\times10^{-10} \ \mathrm{eV}$. This effectively sets an upper bound on the boson particle mass, beyond which it becomes not feasible to probe the properties of FBSs by investigating the I-Love-Q relation violations.

2025-05-07, **Attracting without being attracted: Dark Matter as an aether wind**, Raymond Isichei et.al., [2505.04544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04544v1)

 We explore the possibility that part of what we call dark matter may be the mark of a preferred frame, revealing a breakdown of diffeomorphism invariance. In the non-relativistic limit this appears as a deviant matter source capable of attracting normal matter, but not feeling the attraction from other forms of matter or from itself. While this implies a violation of momentum conservation, no logical inconsistencies arise in this deviant ``Newtonian'' limit. In contrast, due to Bianchi identities, the relativistic theory must undergo core change, and we discuss a modification of Einstein's gravity capable of coupling a non-conserved source to gravity. It results from fixing some of the spatial components of the metric, thereby constraining the possible diffeomorphisms and clipping some of the equations. Bianchi identities can always be used to refill the equations, but the effective Stueckelberg stresses are so outlandish that this defines symmetry breakdown and violations of local energy-momentum conservation. We work out spherically symmetric solutions with static halos and flat rotation curves, with and without a central black hole. The model has the drawback that it can evade experimental constraints simply by setting to zero the local density of deviant matter (which is a non-dynamic input). Its presence, in contrast, would leave inimitable signatures. We briefly discuss the Hamiltonian formulation of these models, where such dark matter appears as a central charge in the Poisson bracket of the Hamiltonian and the momentum.

2025-05-07, **Mass Modeling the Andromeda Dwarf Galaxies: Andromeda VI and Andromeda XXIII**, Connor S. Pickett et.al., [2505.04475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04475v1)

 Accurately mapping the mass profiles of low mass dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies allows us to test predictions made by dark matter (DM) models. To date, such analyses have primarily been performed on Milky Way (MW) satellites. Meanwhile, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is home to 35 known dwarf galaxies, yet only two have been successfully mass-modeled so far. In order to better understand the nature of dark matter, a more comprehensive study of Local Group dwarfs is necessary. In this study, we have undertaken a dynamical study of two higher-luminosity Andromeda dwarf galaxies: Andromeda VI (And VI) and Andromeda XXIII (And XXIII). We infer an enclosed mass for And VI of M(r < r$\_{\rm{h}}$) = (4.9 $\pm$ 1.5) $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$\_{\odot}$, corresponding to a mass-to-light ratio of $[M/L]\_{r\_{\rm{h}}}$ = (27.1 $\pm$ 8.2) M$\_{\odot}$/L$\_{\odot}$. We infer an enclosed mass for And XXIII of M(r < r$\_{\rm{h}}$) = (3.1 $\pm$ 1.9) $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$\_{\odot}$, corresponding to a mass-to-light ratio of $[M/L]\_{\rm{r\_{h}}}$ = (90.2 $\pm$ 53.9) M$\_{\odot}$/L$\_{\odot}$. Using the dynamical Jeans modeling tool, GravSphere, we determine And VI and And XXIII's dark matter density at 150 pc, finding $\rho\_{\rm{DM,VI}}$(150 pc) = (1.4 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times$ 10$^{8}$ M$\_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-3}$ and $\rho\_{\rm{DM,XXIII}}$(150 pc) = 0.5$\substack{+0.4 \\ -0.3} \times$ 10$^{8}$ M$\_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-3}$. Our results make And VI the first mass-modeled M31 satellite to fall into the cuspy regime, while And XXIII has a lower density, implying either a more cored central dark matter density, or a lowering of the density through tides. This adds And XXIII to a growing list of M31 dwarfs with a central density lower than most MW dwarfs and lower than expected for isolated dwarfs in the Standard Cosmology. This could be explained by the M31 dwarfs having experienced stronger tides than their Milky Way counterparts.

2025-05-07, **Portal Matter Models of Kinetic Mixing with Two Light Dark Gauge Bosons**, Thomas G. Rizzo et.al., [2505.04474v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04474v1)

 The kinetic mixing (KM) portal mandates the existence of at least one new gauge boson, the dark photon (DP) based on the group $U(1)\_D$, which mixes with the Standard Model (SM) photon via loops of other new heavy particles carrying both SM and dark charges called portal matter (PM). Arguments exist based on the RGE running of the $U(1)\_D$ gauge coupling suggesting that at higher scales $U(1)\_D$ becomes part of a more complex non-Abelian group, a simple example being just the SM-like $G\_D=SU(2)\_I \times U(1)\_{Y\_I}$. In our past analyses it was always assumed that $G\_D$ broke in a SM-like manner directly to the DP's $U(1)\_D$ which then subsequently broke at low energies $\lsim 1$ GeV. However, this need not be the case and $G\_D$ can instead break to $U(1)\_{T\_{3I}}\times U(1)\_{Y\_I}$, with $T\_{3I}$ being the diagonal generator of $SU(2)\_I$, now producing two light gauge bosons which obtain masses at the $\lsim 1$ GeV scale. In this paper we will explore the phenomenology of a very simple realization of this kind of alternative setup employing non-abelian KM and having a minimal, lepton-like PM sector, demonstrating its distinctive nature in comparison to the previously examined symmetry breaking path. The effects of interference between these gauge bosons on thermal dark matter annihilation, the production of new heavy gauge, Higgs and PM states at colliders, as well as the corresponding signatures for the light dark gauge bosons are examined.

2025-05-07, **In search of an interaction in the dark sector through Gaussian Process and ANN approaches**, Mazaharul Abedin et.al., [2505.04336v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04336v1)

 Whether the current observational data indicate any evidence of interaction between the dark sector is a matter of supreme interest at the present moment. This article searched for an interaction in the dark sector between a pressure-less dark matter and a dark energy fluid with constant equation of state, $w\_{\rm DE}$. For this purpose, two non-parametric approaches, namely, the Gaussian Process (GP) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been employed and using the Hubble data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon+ from Supernovae Type Ia and their combination we have reconstructed the interaction function. We find that for $w\_{\rm DE} =-1$, the interaction in the dark sector is not prominent while for $w\_{\rm DE} \neq -1$, evidence of interaction is found depending on the value of $w\_{\rm DE}$. In particularly, we find that if we start deviating from $w\_{\rm DE} = -1$ either in the quintessence ($w\_{\rm DE} > -1$) or phantom ($w\_{\rm DE} < -1$) direction, an emergence of dark interaction is observed from both GP and ANN reconstructions. We further note that ANN which is applied for the first time in this context seems to play a very efficient role compared to GP.

2025-05-07, **Examining scalar portal inelastic dark matter with lepton fixed target experiments**, I. V. Voronchikhin et.al., [2505.04290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04290v1)

 The inelastic dark matter (DM) scenarios have attracted considerable attention in contemporary particles physics. In this study, we investigate the phenomenology of sub-GeV inelastic dark matter scenarios mediated by a lepton-specific scalar portal. By solving Boltzmann equations, we obtain a thermal target curves for the set of inelastic DM mass splitting in the sub-GeV mediator mass range. We study the discovery potential of lepton fixed-target experiments, particularly NA64e and NA64$\mu$, through their missing-energy signatures. Our analysis focuses on the $\phi$-strahlung process, $l N \to l N \phi$, followed by the invisible decay of the scalar mediator into Majorana dark matter particles $\phi \to \chi\_1 \chi\_2$, as a probe of the mediator coupling with charged leptons of Standard Model. For the viable parameters of the inelastic dark matter scenario, we derive the sensitivity projections for NA64e and NA64$\mu$, implying that boosted state $\chi\_2$ decays visibly $\chi\_2 \to \chi\_1 e^+ e^-$ beyond the detector acceptance. Our results demonstrate the complementary roles of electron- and muon-beam experiments in exploring the sub-GeV inelastic dark matter sector mediated by the scalar portal.

2025-05-07, **Relativistic structure of a supermassive black hole embedded in the dark matter halo of NGC 4649 (M60)**, Francisco S. N. Lobo et.al., [2505.04222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04222v1)

 We construct a static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solution embedded within a dark matter (DM) halo, formulated as a non-vacuum extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime. The DM distribution is modeled via an empirical density profile calibrated to observations of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60), incorporating Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, stellar velocity dispersion data, and globular cluster dynamics. The resultant spacetime metric depends on three independent parameters: the black hole mass $M$, the asymptotic circular velocity $V\_c$, and the halo scale radius $a$, and smoothly reduces to the Schwarzschild limit as $V\_c \to 0$ and $a \to 0$. We analyze the influence of the halo on key geometric and physical quantities, including the event horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow size, and curvature invariants. The Kretschmann scalar exhibits an enhanced sensitivity to halo-induced modifications, particularly in the near-horizon regime. Thermodynamic properties of the solution are also examined. In the extremal limit, characterized by a vanishing surface gravity, the model supports a finite tangential pressure, implying a non-trivial extension of standard black hole thermodynamics. These results highlight the relevance of incorporating astrophysical environments into BH modeling and offer new avenues for testing strong-field gravity through precision observational data.

2025-05-07, **Orders-of-magnitude improved precision spectroscopy of an inner-shell orbital clock transition in neutral ytterbium**, Taiki Ishiyama et.al., [2505.04154v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04154v1)

 An inner-shell orbital clock transition $^1S\_0 \leftrightarrow 4f^{13}5d6s^2 \: (J=2)$ in neutral ytterbium atoms has attracted much attention as a new optical frequency standard as well as a highly sensitive probe to several new physics phenomena, such as ultra-light dark matter, violation of local Lorentz invariance, and a new Yukawa potential between electrons and neutrons. Here, we demonstrate almost two-orders-of-magnitude improved precision spectroscopy over the previous reports by trapping atoms in a three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattice. In particular, we successfully observe the coherent Rabi oscillation, the relaxation dynamics of the excited state, and the interorbital Feshbach resonance. To highlight the high precision of our spectroscopy, we carry out precise isotope shift measurements between five stable bosonic isotopes well below 10 Hz uncertainties, successfully setting bounds for a hypothetical boson mediating a force between electrons and neutrons. These results open up the way for various new physics search experiments and a wide range of applications to quantum science with this clock transition.

2025-05-07, **Galactic Spacetime Solutions with a Varying Newton's Coupling**, Rounak Chakraborty et.al., [2505.04060v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04060v1)

 We find a new family of galactic metrics corresponding to flat rotation curves at the outer radii. These are vacuum solutions to a gravity theory where the Newton's coupling varies mildly in space. The effective `mass', whose origin is purely geometric, receives a negative non-baryonic contribution. The angle of deflection of a light ray propagating in this geometry is found to be diminished rather than enhanced compared to the Einsteinian bending, the effect being highly suppressed though. Hence, these spacetimes are observationally dintinguishable from other geometric or `dark matter' based alternatives invoked to explain mass discrepancies in galaxies.

2025-05-07, **Constraints on Asymmetric Dark Matter Self Annihilation Cross Sections**, Qiquan Li et.al., [2505.04056v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04056v1)

 We investigate the evolution of the relic density for asymmetric dark matter incorporating self annihilation processes in both the shear-dominated universe and Gauss-Bonnet braneworld. Under the same conditions where the ratio of final asymmetry to the initial asymmetry $ R \equiv \Delta\_{-\infty}/\Delta\_{\text{in}} $ is identical, the shear-dominated universe, due to its enhanced Hubble expansion rate, leads to an earlier freeze-out point of wash-out asymmetry process and allows a higher upper limit on the self annihilation cross section. Conversely, the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld, with a weakened Hubble expansion rate, delays the freeze-out point and permits a lower upper limit on the self annihilation cross section. We further constrain the wino mass $M\_2$ for sneutrino and higgsino asymmetric dark matter in both scenarios, showing that, compared to the standard model, the lower limit of $M\_2$ is smaller in the shear-dominated universe but higher in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld.

2025-05-07, **Early and Extensive Ultraviolet Through Near Infrared Observations of the Intermediate-Luminosity Type Iax Supernovae 2024pxl**, W. B. Hoogendam et.al., [2505.04610v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04610v1)

 We present ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby SN 2024pxl, the third Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 6384. SN 2024pxl is a Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) with an intermediate luminosity ($M\_r = -16.99\pm0.32$ mag) and an average SN Iax light curve decline rate. SN 2024pxl was discovered $\sim$3 days after first light, and the rising light curve follows a single power law that is inconsistent with significant interaction with a companion star or circumstellar material. Our extensive NIR photometric coverage is comparable to that of the well-observed SNe Iax 2005hk and 2012Z, and we demonstrate that the $J-H$ colors of SNe Iax differ from normal SNe Ia and appear to be more homogeneous as a class. Spectroscopically, we report the earliest-ever NIR spectrum of a SN Iax as measured from maximum light ($t\approx-9$ days): a featureless continuum with similarities to a $\sim$9,000 K blackbody, and the line velocities are consistent with a mixed-ejecta structure, with C, Si, and Fe having similar velocities and velocity evolutions. We find a tentative correlation between the $H$-band break Co II velocity $\sim$20 days post-peak and absolute magnitude, with more luminous SNe Iax showing faster Co II velocities. Our observations suggest that SN 2024pxl resulted from the thermonuclear disruption of a CO white dwarf star that undergoes deflagration burning.

 Dwarf galaxies serve as powerful laboratories for investigating the underlying physics of galaxy evolution including the impact of baryonic feedback processes and environmental influences. We compare the visual and structural properties of dwarf galaxies in ultra-deep HSC-SSP imaging of the COSMOS field with those measured from realistic HSC-like synthetic observations of dwarfs generated by the Illustris TNG50 and NewHorizon simulations. Using S\'ersic profile fitting and non-parametric morphological metrics (Gini, $M\_{20}$, asymmetry, and concentration), we evaluate the diversity of structural properties in observed and simulated galaxies.   Our analysis shows that NewHorizon and TNG50 galaxies lie at opposite extremes of observed structural trends: NewHorizon produces diffuse, extended galaxies with shallow S\'ersic indices, while TNG50 yields compact, concentrated systems with steep indices. Both simulations reproduce observed structural trends more closely at higher stellar masses ($M\_{\star}\sim10^{9.5} {\rm M\_{\odot}}$) but fail to capture the full diversity of COSMOS dwarfs at lower masses. Non-parametric metrics further show that NewHorizon galaxies exhibit more uneven, clumpy light distributions while TNG50 galaxies have smoother but excessively concentrated profiles. These structural differences reflect underlying differences in their physical prescriptions and are likely driven by differing approaches to ISM physics, supernova feedback and star formation in addition to differences in numerical resolution.   Our findings highlight the unique power of low-mass galaxies to constrain differences in simulation physics, especially star formation and feedback. Upcoming surveys from facilities like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid will enable more rigorous comparisons with simulations, offering deeper insights into the physical processes shaping galaxy evolution.

 Whether the current observational data indicate any evidence of interaction between the dark sector is a matter of supreme interest at the present moment. This article searched for an interaction in the dark sector between a pressure-less dark matter and a dark energy fluid with constant equation of state, $w\_{\rm DE}$. For this purpose, two non-parametric approaches, namely, the Gaussian Process (GP) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been employed and using the Hubble data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon+ from Supernovae Type Ia and their combination we have reconstructed the interaction function. We find that for $w\_{\rm DE} =-1$, the interaction in the dark sector is not prominent while for $w\_{\rm DE} \neq -1$, evidence of interaction is found depending on the value of $w\_{\rm DE}$. In particularly, we find that if we start deviating from $w\_{\rm DE} = -1$ either in the quintessence ($w\_{\rm DE} > -1$) or phantom ($w\_{\rm DE} < -1$) direction, an emergence of dark interaction is observed from both GP and ANN reconstructions. We further note that ANN which is applied for the first time in this context seems to play a very efficient role compared to GP.

 We present the serendipitous radio-continuum discovery of a likely Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G305.4-2.2. This object displays a remarkable circular symmetry in shape, making it one of the most circular Galactic SNRs known. Nicknamed Teleios due to its symmetry, it was detected in the new Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) radio-continuum images with an angular size of 1320"x1260" and PA = 0 deg. While there is a hint of possible H$\alpha$ and gamma-ray emission, Teleios is exclusively seen at radio-continuum frequencies. Interestingly, Teleios is not only almost perfectly symmetric, but it also has one of the lowest surface brightnesses discovered among Galactic SNRs and a steep spectral index of $\alpha=-0.6\pm 0.3$. Our estimates from HI studies and the Sigma-D relation place Teleios as a type Ia SNR at a distance of either ~2.2 kpc of ~7.7 kpc. This indicates two possible scenarios, either a young (under 1000 yr) or an older SNR (over 10000 yr). With a corresponding diameter of 14/48 pc, our evolutionary studies place Teleios at the either early or late Sedov phase, depending on the distance estimate. However, our modelling also predicts X-ray emission, which we do not see in the present generation of eROSITA images. We also explored a type Iax explosion scenario that points to a much closer distance of <1 kpc and Teleios size of only ~3.3 pc, which would be similar to the only known type Iax remnant SN1181. Unfortunately, all examined scenarios have their challenges, and no definitive supernova (SN) origin type can be established at this stage. Teleios's symmetrical shape suggests expansion into a rarefied and isotropic ambient medium. The low radio surface brightness and the lack of pronounced polarisation can be explained by a high level of ambient rotation measure (RM), with the largest RM being observed at centre.
