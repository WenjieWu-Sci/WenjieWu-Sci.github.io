2024-07-30, **Spin response of neutron matter in ab initio approach**, J. E. Sobczyk et.al., [2407.20986v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20986v1)

 We propose a general method embedded in the ab initio nuclear framework to reconstruct linear response functions and calculate sum rules. Within our approach, based on the Gaussian integral transform, we consistently treat the groundstate and the excited spectrum. Crucially, the method allows for a robust uncertainty estimation of the spectral reconstruction. We showcase it for the spin response in neutron matter. Our calculations are performed using state-of-the-art many-body coupled-cluster method and Hamiltonians derived in the chiral effective field theory, emphasizing the analysis of finite-size effects. This work serves as a stepping stone towards further studies of neutrino interactions in astrophysical environments from first principles.

2024-07-30, **GeV scale dark matter and $B\rightarrow K+$ missing energy phenomenology in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ model**, Ajay Kumar Yadav et.al., [2407.20974v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20974v1)

 We elucidate the recently observed discrepancy in the branching ratio of $B^{+}\rightarrow K^{+}$ +inv decay mode using a GeV scale scalar dark matter in an anomaly-free $U(1)\_{B-L}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model. We constrain the new parameters by using consistency with the existing bounds on Dark matter relic density, direct detection, collider and BR($B\rightarrow K^*\nu\bar{\nu}$) measured at the Belle II experiment. We investigate couplings between the mediator and the SM fermions as well as the dark matter particle. We then estimate the branching ratios of $b \to s \nu \bar \nu$ decay processes such as $B\rightarrow (K^+,K^*)\nu\bar{\nu}$, $B\_s\rightarrow (\eta,\eta')\nu\bar{\nu}$, $ B\_s\rightarrow \phi\nu\bar{\nu}$ and $B\_c\rightarrow (D\_s, D\_s^*)\nu\bar{\nu}$ in a common parameter space, meeting the current experimental bounds of both sectors simultaneously.

2024-07-30, **Track signals at IceCube from subleading channels**, Reinaldo Francener et.al., [2407.20963v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20963v1)

 Tracks events at the IceCube Observatory are characterized by an energetic muon crossing several kilometers before decaying. Such muons are dominantly produced in charged current (CC) muon neutrino - hadron interactions. However, muons are also produced through the $W$ - boson production and in the decay of tau leptons and heavy mesons created in neutral and charged current interactions induced by all neutrino flavors. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of these subleading channels to events characterized as tracks at the IceCube. Our results indicate that these channels correspond to a non - negligible fraction of the HESE track events. In addition, we show that its contributions are concentrated in muons that are less energetic than those arising from muonic neutrino CC interactions for the same visible energies of the process. Finally, we investigate the impact of these additional channels on the description of the astrophysical neutrino flux, and we find that the inclusion of these subleading processes are important in determining the parameters of the astrophysical neutrino flux.

2024-07-30, **Multi-$Z'$ signatures of spontaneously broken local $U(1)'$ symmetry**, Takaaki Nomura et.al., [2407.20742v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20742v1)

 We discuss multi-$Z'$ signatures coming from decays of Higgs bosons in models with a spontaneously broken $U(1)'$ symmetry, which can be observed as "lepton jets" or multi-lepton final states depending on the mass range of new bosons. We consider anomaly-free $U(1)'$ models without introducing new fermions except for right-handed neutrinos, in which the Higgs sector is composed of an isospin doublet and a singlet fields with zero and non-zero $U(1)'$ charges, respectively. The multi-$Z'$ signatures can then be obtained via the decays of the discovered (extra) Higgs boson $h$ ($\phi$), i.e., $h\to Z'Z'$, $\phi \to Z'Z'$ and/or $h \to \phi\phi \to 4Z'$ as far as kinematically allowed. We give the upper limit on the branching ratios of $h$ into $Z'Z'$ and $4Z'$ from the current experimental data in each model. We also show the deviation in the $hhh$ coupling from the standard model prediction at one-loop level, and find that its amount is typically smaller than 1\%.

2024-07-30, **Revealing the Origin of Neutrino Masses through Displaced Shower Searches in the CMS Muon System**, Wei Liu et.al., [2407.20676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20676v1)

 We study the potential to probe the origin of neutrino masses, by searching for long-lived right-handed neutrinos~(RHNs) $N$ in the $B-L$ gauge model. Despite the small active-sterile mixing $\|V\_{\ell N}\|^2$, RHNs are produced abundantly via SM and exotic Higgs production, as long as the Higgs mixing is sufficiently large. We reinterpret a search for displaced showers in the CMS muon system and we find that it is sensitive to parameter space at and below the canonical seesaw floor, $\|V\_{\ell N}\|^2 \approx 10^{-12}$ ($\ell = e$, $\tau$) for $m\_N \approx 40$ GeV. With existing data constraining such a well-motivated scenario of neutrino mass generation, we determine the projected sensitivity at the HL-LHC, motivating dedicated searches for long-lived RHNs with decay lengths $\approx 10$ m.

2024-07-30, **Prospects of five-dimensional $L_μ-L_τ$ gauge interactions in the light of elastic neutrino-electron scatterings: the scope of the DUNE near detector**, Dibyendu Chakraborty et.al., [2407.20615v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20615v1)

 We discuss the future prospects of a minimally five-dimensional version of the well-motivated scenario for addressing the discrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment, the $U(1)\_{L\_\mu - L\_\tau}$ extension of the standard model (SM) gauge symmetry. Here, multiple associated massive gauge bosons appear thanks to the five-dimensional $U(1)\_{L\_\mu - L\_\tau}$ gauge symmetry, and they contribute to the muon $(g-2)$ and also other processes. We focus on the powerful probe of elastic neutrino-electron scatterings since the upcoming DUNE experiment will explore MeV-scale uncharted regions by previous experiments (e.g., CHARM-II and Borexino) in the near future. We found that even with small kinetic mixing parameters, much of the parameter space, including those satisfying muon $(g-2)$, can be probed using several years of data from the DUNE experiment, focusing on the near detector. In our scenario, interference effects between intermediate-state gauge bosons play an important role. Our results include comparisons between flat and warped extra dimensions.

2024-07-30, **Inspecting neutrino flavor instabilities during proto-neutron star cooling phase in supernova: I. Spherically symmetric model**, Masamichi Zaizen et.al., [2407.20548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20548v1)

 In the standard model of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), all neutrinos are assumed to be in pure flavor eigenstates in CCSN cores, but the assumption becomes invalid if neutrino distributions are unstable to flavor conversions. In this paper, we present a study of the occurrences of two representative neutrino-flavor instabilities, fast- and collisional flavor instabilities, in the cooling phase of proto-neutron star (PNS) from 1- to 50 seconds. We follow the long-term evolution of a PNS under spherically symmetric and quasi-static approximations, in which the matter profile is determined by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation with neutrino feedback under the treatment of multi-group flux limited diffusion. For the stability analysis of neutrino flavor conversions, we recompute neutrino distributions using Monte Carlo transport in order to obtain the full angular distribution needed to compute the dispersion relations. We find no signs of flavor conversions in our models; the physical reason is thoroughly investigated. We also argue that the negative conclusion in flavor conversions could be changed qualitatively if multi-dimensional effects are included, as similar to cases in the earlier phase of CCSN.

2024-07-30, **Neutrino Oscillation Effects on the Luminosity of Neutrino-Dominated Accretion Flows Around Black Holes**, Chitipat Deesamer et.al., [2407.20507v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20507v1)

 The stellar-mass black hole surrounded by the neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) is proposed to be the central engine of the gamma-ray burst (GRB). In this work, we investigate the neutrino/anti-neutrino luminosity and annihilation luminosity from the NDAF and pair-annihilation model, taking into account the neutrino oscillation above the accretion disk. The disk hydrodynamical properties are modelled using the empirical solution previously derived with boundary conditions including the effect of electron degeneracy and neutrino trapping. Our key parameters are the mass accretion rate and the black hole spin given in the range of $\dot{M} = 0.1$ - $10$ $M\_\odot$ s$^{-1}$ and $ 0 \le a < 1$, respectively. Without neutrino oscillation, the obtained neutrino/anti-neutrino luminosity is $\sim 10^{51}$ - $10^{53}$ $\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$, while the neutrino annihilation luminosity is found to be $\sim 10^{46}$ - $10^{51}$ $\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. In the presence of neutrino oscillation in the vacuum limit, the electron neutrino annihilation luminosity decreases by $\lesssim 22\%$ through the flavor transformation, while the muon- and tau-neutrino luminosity can increase up to $\sim 45\%$ and $ 60\%$, respectively. As a result, the total annihilation luminosity can be reduced up to $\sim 19\%$ due to the oscillation process above the disk. Finally, we also investigate the case whereby the CP-violating phase is changed from $\delta \textrm{CP} =$ $0^{\circ}$ to $245^{\circ}$. However, our results reveal that the CP-violating phase has minimal impact on neutrino annihilation luminosity.

2024-07-29, **Results from ON-OFF analysis of the Neutrinos-Angra detector**, E. Kemp et.al., [2407.20397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20397v1)

 The Neutrinos Angra Experiment, a water-based Cherenkov detector, is located at the Angra dos Reis nuclear power plant in Brazil. Designed to detect electron antineutrinos produced in the nuclear reactor, the primary objective of the experiment is to demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring reactor activity using an antineutrino detector. This effort aligns with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) program to identify potential and novel technologies applicable to nonproliferation safeguards. Operating on the surface presents challenges such as high noise rates, necessitating the development of very sensitive, yet small-scale detectors. These conditions make the Angra experiment an excellent platform for both developing the application and gaining expertise in new technologies and analysis methods. The detector employs a water-based target doped with gadolinium to enhance its sensitivity to antineutrinos. In this work, we describe the main features of the detector and the electronics chain, including front-end and data acquisition components. We detail the data acquisition strategies and the methodologies applied for signal processing and event selection. Preliminary physics results suggest that the detector can reliably monitor reactor operations by detecting the inverse beta decay induced by electron antineutrinos from the reactor.

2024-07-29, **Constraints on non-unitary neutrino mixing in light of atmospheric and reactor neutrino data**, Tetiana Kozynets et.al., [2407.20388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20388v1)

 While the origin of neutrino masses remains unknown, several key neutrino mass generation models result in a non-unitary three-neutrino mixing matrix. To put such models to test, the deviations of the mixing matrix from unitarity can be measured directly through neutrino oscillation experiments. In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis of the non-unitary mixing model using the recent public data from atmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments - namely IceCube-DeepCore, Daya Bay, and KamLAND. The novelty of our approach compared to the preceding global fits for non-unitarity is in the detailed treatment of the atmospheric neutrino data, which for the first time includes the relevant flux and detector systematic uncertainties. From the Bayesian posteriors on the individual mixing matrix elements, we derive the non-unitarity constraints in the form of normalisations and closures of the mixing matrix rows and columns. We find comparable constraints for electron and tau row normalisations as other similar studies in literature, and additionally reveal strong correlations between muon and tau row constraints induced by the atmospheric systematic uncertainties. We find that the current data is well described by both unitary and non-unitary mixing models, with a strong preference for the unitary mixing indicated by the Bayes factor. With the upcoming IceCube-Upgrade and JUNO detectors, both featuring superior energy resolution compared to the current atmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments, our constraints on the row normalisations are expected to improve by a factor of 2 (3) in the tau (muon) sector and by nearly 25% in the electron sector. In the future, our approach can be expanded to include solar and long-baseline neutrino experiments, with the aim to provide more stringent constraints while keeping track of the nuisance parameters that may be degenerate with non-unitarity.

2024-07-29, **Comment on "Final CONUS results on coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering at the Brokdorf reactor"**, J. I. Collar et.al., [2407.20308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20308v1)

 We describe several omissions and deficiencies in the arguments presented by Ackermann et al. (arXiv:2401.07684), pointing at missing information necessary to back up its conclusions.

2024-07-29, **Inspecting binary-neutron-star mergers as production sites of high-energy neutrinos**, Simone Rossoni et.al., [2407.19957v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19957v1)

 The end state of binary-neutron-star (BNS) mergers can manifest conditions to produce high-energy neutrinos. Inspired by the event GW170817, detected in gravitational waves and in optical/infrared emission, we investigate a scenario in which cosmic-ray (CR) particles are accelerated, in a population of BNS mergers, in the energy range from the knee to the ankle. By taking into account the measured thermal and non-thermal energy density of the photon fields in the source environment as a function of the time after the merger, we model the CR interactions and the consequent neutrino production. We propagate the escaped CR and neutrino fluxes through the extragalactic space and compare the expected diffuse fluxes to the experimental data and current limits. Depending on the accelerated CR mass composition and on the contribution of this possible source class to the sub-ankle CR flux, we provide indications on the rate of BNS merger events and the amount of baryons present in the source site.

2024-07-29, **Charged lepton flavour violation from inverse seesaw with flavour and CP symmetries**, F. P. Di Meglio et.al., [2407.19734v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19734v1)

 We study charged lepton flavour violation in a scenario in which light neutrino masses are generated via the inverse seesaw mechanism with 3+3 gauge singlet fermions, Ni and Sj, i,j=1,2,3. Lepton mixing is predicted with the help of the flavour symmetries Delta (3 n^2) and Delta (6 n^2) combined with CP. In the neutral lepton sector, the non-trivial flavour structure is only encoded in the Dirac neutrino Yukawa matrix (the coupling relating left-handed lepton doublets and gauge singlets Ni). Current experimental bounds on the processes mu -> e gamma, mu -> 3 e, mu-e conversion in nuclei and the tau lepton decays tau -> l gamma and tau -> 3 l, l=e, mu, do not constrain the considered parameter space of this scenario. Prospective limits on the decay mu -> 3 e and mu-e conversion in aluminium instead can markedly reduce the available parameter space. We also comment on the effects of the heavy sterile states on light neutrino masses and lepton mixing.

2024-07-29, **Common Origin of Dark Matter and Leptogenesis in $U(1)_{B-L}$**, Ang Liu et.al., [2407.19730v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19730v1)

 In this paper, we investigate the common parameter space of dark matter and leptogenesis in the $U(1)\_{B-L}$ symmetry. This model involves a complex scalar $\phi$, sterile neutrinos $N$, and Majorana dark matter $\chi$, where only dark matter $\chi$ is charged under the $Z\_2$ symmetry. Masses of $N$ and $\chi$ are generated via the Yukawa interactions to $\phi$ after breaking of the $U(1)\_{B-L}$ symmetry. TeV scale sterile neutrinos $N$ are responsible for the generation of baryon asymmetry through the resonance leptogenesis mechanism. The new particles in the $U(1)\_{B-L}$ have a significant impact on the dilution of $N$, thus on leptogenesis. Meanwhile, the annihilation processes of dark matter $\chi$ are almost identical to that of $N$, which indicates that both leptogenesis and dark matter are closely related to satisfying the observed results simultaneously. Under various theoretical and experimental constraints, the viable common parameter space of dark matter and leptogenesis is obtained for both global and local $U(1)\_{B-L}$ symmetry.

2024-07-30, **A Multiwavelength Portrait of the 3C 220.3 Lensed System**, Sóley Ó. Hyman et.al., [2407.21020v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21020v1)

 The 3C 220.3 system is a rare case of a foreground narrow-line radio galaxy ("galaxy A," $z\_A = 0.6850$) lensing a background submillimeter galaxy ($z\_{{\rm SMG1}} = 2.221$). New spectra from MMT/Binospec confirm that the companion galaxy ("galaxy B") is part of the lensing system with $z\_B = 0.6835$. New three-color HST data reveal a full Einstein ring and allow a more precise lens model. The new HST images also reveal extended emission around galaxy A, and the spectra show extended [OII] emission with irregular morphology and complex velocity structure. All indications are that the two lensing galaxies are a gravitationally interacting pair. Strong [OII] emission from both galaxies A and B suggests current star formation, which could be a consequence of the interaction. This would indicate a younger stellar population than previously assumed and imply smaller stellar masses for the same luminosity. The improved lens model and expanded spectral energy distributions have enabled better stellar-mass estimates for the foreground galaxies. The resulting dark matter fractions are ~0.8, higher than previously calculated. Deeper Chandra imaging shows extended X-ray emission but no evidence for a point X-ray source associated with either galaxy. The detection of X-rays from the radio lobes of 3C 220.3 allows an estimate of ~3 nT for the magnetic fields in the lobes, a factor of ~3 below the equipartition fields, as typical for radio galaxies.

2024-07-30, **Bayesian technique to combine independently-trained Machine-Learning models applied to direct dark matter detection**, David Cerdeno et.al., [2407.21008v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21008v1)

 We carry out a Bayesian analysis of dark matter (DM) direct detection data to determine particle model parameters using the Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) machine learning technique. TMNRE avoids an explicit calculation of the likelihood, which instead is estimated from simulated data, unlike in traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This considerably speeds up, by several orders of magnitude, the computation of the posterior distributions, which allows to perform the Bayesian analysis of an otherwise computationally prohibitive number of benchmark points. In this article we demonstrate that, in the TMNRE framework, it is possible to include, combine, and remove different datasets in a modular fashion, which is fast and simple as there is no need to re-train the machine learning algorithm or to define a combined likelihood. In order to assess the performance of this method, we consider the case of WIMP DM with spin-dependent and independent interactions with protons and neutrons in a xenon experiment. After validating our results with MCMC, we employ the TMNRE procedure to determine the regions where the DM parameters can be reconstructed. Finally, we present CADDENA, a Python package that implements the modular Bayesian analysis of direct detection experiments described in this work.

2024-07-30, **Kinematic Lensing with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument -- Probing structure formation at very low redshift**, Jiachuan Xu et.al., [2407.20867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20867v1)

 We explore the science prospects of a 14,000 deg$^2$ Kinematic Lensing (KL) survey with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and overlapping imaging surveys. KL infers the cosmic shear signal by jointly forward modeling the observed photometric image and velocity field of a disk galaxy. The latter can be constrained by placing multiple DESI fibers along the galaxy's major and minor axis, a concept similar to the DESI Peculiar Velocity Survey. We study multiple subset galaxy samples of the DESI Legacy Survey Data Release 9 catalog and quantify the residual shape noise, $\sigma\_\epsilon$, of each sample as a function of cuts in $r$-band magnitude using mock observations. We conduct simulated likelihood analyses for these galaxy samples and find that a DESI-KL program can place highly interesting constraints on structure formation at very low redshifts, i.e. $\sigma\_8(z<0.15)$. We conclude that if the $S\_8$ tension consolidates as a phenomenon, a DESI-KL survey can provide unique insights into this phenomenon in the very late-time Universe. Given the different footprints of DESI and Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), lensing results from both surveys are highly complementary and can be combined into a joint lensing survey. We further note that DESI-KL benefits multiple additional science cases, e.g. studies of modified gravity models when combined with peculiar velocity surveys, and dark matter studies that are based on galaxy-galaxy lensing of dwarf galaxies.

2024-07-30, **A GUT Framework for Accidental Composite Dark Matter**, Salvatore Bottaro et.al., [2407.20591v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20591v1)

 We study and classify $SU(5)$-GUT completions of accidental composite dark matter models. These theories postulate new vectorlike confining dark color dynamics and give an accidentally stable baryonic dark matter candidate. In realistic theories, dark fermion $SU(5)$ irreps split into light dark quarks, whose bound states include the dark matter, and their much heavier GUT partners. A simple analysis shows that such a mass hierarchy requires a fine tuning of parameters and thus implies a naturalness problem. We select theories requiring that all dangerous metastable states decay before the onset of nucleosynthesis through higher-dimensional operators generated at the GUT scale or at the mass scale of dark quark GUT partners. Demanding Standard Model gauge coupling unification puts severe constraints on the landscape of viable theories. Under the assumption of an approximately degenerate spectrum of dark quark GUT partners, we find that only one model gives precision unification.

2024-07-30, **Extragalactic Stellar Tidal Streams in the Dark Energy Survey**, Juan Miro-Carretero et.al., [2407.20483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20483v1)

 Stellar tidal streams are a key tracer of galaxy evolution and have the potential to provide an indirect means for tracing dark matter. For the Local Group, many diffuse substructures have been identified and their link to galaxy evolution has been traced. However, an analysis of a larger sample is required to better probe the frequency and characteristics of these streams to verify the predictions of the Lambda-CDM model and its implementation in cosmological simulations. For that purpose, we are carrying out the first systematic survey of faint stellar debris from tidally disrupted dwarf satellites around nearby galaxies up to a distance of 100 Mpc. In this paper, we present a catalogue with the results of the first harvest of stellar tidal streams found by visual inspection in deep images of ~ 700 galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We include a photometric characterisation of the streams obtained by measuring their surface brightnesses and colours. We found a total of 63 streams in our sample at distances between 40 and 100 Mpc, including 59 which were not previously reported. We measured their average surface brightness for the grz bands, to be 28.35+/-0.20, 27.81+/-0.13 and 27.62+/-0.09 mag arcsec^-2, respectively. By applying a statistical analysis to our findings, we obtained a stream detection frequency of 9.1% +/- 1.1% , in agreement with previous studies. We identified stream progenitors in 5-14% of our stream sample, depending on the confidence level. The first catalogue of streams in the Local Universe presented here will be complemented by future stream surveys within the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey. In this work we have learnt that the faintest measured stream surface brightness can be significantly brighter than the surface brightness limit of an image measured at pixel level, mainly due to correlated noise present in the images.

2024-07-29, **Galaxies and Their Environment at $z \gtrsim 10$ -- I: Primordial Chemical Enrichment, Accretion, Cooling, and Virialization of Gas in Dark Matter Halos**, William M. Hicks et.al., [2407.20429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20429v1)

 Recent observations made using the James Webb Space Telescope have identified a number of high-redshift galaxies that are unexpectedly luminous. In light of this, it is clear that a more detailed understanding of the high redshift, pre-reionization universe is required for us to obtain the complete story of galaxy formation. This study is the first in a series that seeks to tell the story of galaxy formation at $z \gtrsim 10$ using a suite of large-scale adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulations. Our machine-learning-accelerated surrogate model for Population III star formation and feedback, StarNet, gives us an unprecedented ability to obtain physically accurate, inhomogeneous chemical initial conditions for a statistically significant number of galaxies. We find that of the 12,423 halos in the mass range of $10^6\,\,M\_\odot < M\_\mathrm{vir} < 10^9\,\, M\_\odot$ that form in our fiducial simulation, $16\%$ are chemically enriched by Population III supernovae by $z\sim12$. We then profile and compare various cooling processes at the centers of halos, and find a complete absence of atomic cooling halos. All of our halos with central cooling gas are dominated by H$\_2$ cooling, metal cooling, or a mixture of the two, even in the presence of a strong H$\_2$-photodissociating Lyman-Werner background. We also find that gas accretion through the virial radius is not driven by cooling. We find that gas virialization in halos with $M\_\mathrm{vir}\gtrsim10^7\,\,M\_\odot$ is supported by bulk turbulent flows, and that thermal energy accounts for only a small fraction of the total kinetic energy. Because of this, the mean gas temperature is well below the virial temperature for these halos. We then compute the mass of gas that is available for Population II star formation, and infer star formation rates for each potential star-forming halo.

2024-07-29, **WZW terms without anomalies: generalised symmetries in chiral Lagrangians**, Joe Davighi et.al., [2407.20340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20340v1)

 We consider a 4d non-linear sigma model on the coset $(\mathrm{SU}(N)\_L \times \mathrm{SU}(N)\_R \times \mathrm{SU}(2))/(\mathrm{SU}(N)\_{L+R}\times \mathrm{U}(1))\cong \mathrm{SU}(N) \times S^2$, that features a topological Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term whose curvature is $\frac{n}{24\pi^2}\mathrm{Tr}(g^{-1}dg)^3 \wedge \mathrm{Vol}\_{S^2}$ where $g$ is the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pion field. This WZW term, unlike its familiar cousin in QCD, does not match any chiral anomaly, so its microscopic origin is not obviously QCD-like. We find that generalised symmetries provide a key to unlocking a UV completion. The $S^2$ winding number bestows the theory with a 1-form symmetry, and the WZW term intertwines this with the $\mathrm{SU}(N)^2$ flavour symmetry into a 2-group global symmetry. Like a 't Hooft anomaly, the 2-group symmetry should match between UV and IR, precluding QCD-like completions that otherwise give the right pion manifold. We instead construct a weakly-coupled UV completion that matches the 2-group symmetry, in which an abelian gauge field connects the QCD baryon number current to the winding number current of a $\mathbb{C}P^1$ model, and explicitly show how the mixed WZW term arises upon flowing to the IR. The coefficient is fixed to be the number of QCD colours and, strikingly, this matching must be 'tree-level exact' to satisfy a quantization condition. We discuss generalisations, and elucidate the more intricate generalised symmetry structure that arises upon gauging an anomaly-free subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(N)\_{L+R}$. This WZW term may even play a phenomenological role as a portal to a dark sector, that determines the relic abundance of dark matter.

2024-07-29, **Combined constraints for scalars and pseudoscalars from $\left(g-2\right)_l$ and $e^+e^-$ colliders**, Aleksandr Pustyntsev et.al., [2407.20202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20202v1)

 Scalars and pseudoscalars with masses in the MeV to GeV range are of interest in different extensions of the Standard Model. Such particles are often associated with dark matter, the strong CP problem and the $\left(g-2\right)\_{\mu}$ anomaly. In this work we investigate limits for masses of such particles and their couplings to photons and leptons which can be derived from present and future $e^+e^-$ collider experiments and current $\left(g-2\right)\_{l}$ measurements. Our work expands upon previous studies in several ways, demonstrating that the interplay of both couplings is a decisive factor in this type of analyses.

2024-07-29, **Irreducible cosmological backgrounds of a real scalar with a broken symmetry**, Francesco D'Eramo et.al., [2407.19997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19997v1)

 We explore the irreducible cosmological implications of a singlet real scalar field. Our focus is on theories with an approximate and spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ symmetry where quasi-stable domain walls can form at early times. This seemingly simple framework bears a wealth of phenomenological implications that can be tackled by means of different cosmological and astrophysical probes. We elucidate the connection between domain wall dynamics and the production of dark matter and gravitational waves. In particular, we identify three main benchmark scenarios. The gravitational wave signal observed by pulsar timing arrays can be generated by the domain walls if the mass of the singlet is $m\_s \sim\,$PeV. For lower masses, but with $m\_s \gtrsim 10\,$GeV, scalars produced in the annihilation of the domain walls can be dark matter with a distinctive feature in their power spectrum. Finally, the thermal bath provides an unavoidable source of unstable scalars via the freeze-in mechanism whose subsequent decays can be tested by their imprints on cosmological and terrestrial observables.

2024-07-29, **Euclid preparation. Exploring the properties of proto-clusters in the Simulated Euclid Wide Survey**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2407.19919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19919v1)

 Galaxy proto-clusters are receiving an increased interest since most of the processes shaping the structure of clusters of galaxies and their galaxy population are happening at early stages of their formation. The Euclid Survey will provide a unique opportunity to discover a large number of proto-clusters over a large fraction of the sky (14 500 square degrees). In this paper, we explore the expected observational properties of proto-clusters in the Euclid Wide Survey by means of theoretical models and simulations. We provide an overview of the predicted proto-cluster extent, galaxy density profiles, mass-richness relations, abundance, and sky-filling as a function of redshift. Useful analytical approximations for the functions of these properties are provided. The focus is on the redshift range z= 1.5 to 4. We discuss in particular the density contrast with which proto-clusters can be observed against the background in the galaxy distribution if photometric galaxy redshifts are used as supplied by the ESA Euclid mission together with the ground-based photometric surveys. We show that the obtainable detection significance is sufficient to find large numbers of interesting proto-cluster candidates. For quantitative studies, additional spectroscopic follow-up is required to confirm the proto-clusters and establish their richness.

 We propose a direct axion dark matter (DM) search using superconducting transmon qubits as quantum sensors. With an external magnetic field applied, axion DM generates an oscillating electric field which causes the excitation of the qubit; such an excitation can be regarded as a signal of the axion DM. We provide a theoretical consideration of the excitation process of the qubits taking into account the effects of the shielding cavity surrounding the qubits and estimate the signal rate for the axion DM detection. We also discuss the enhancement of the DM signal by using cavity resonance and entangled quantum sensors realized by a quantum circuit. Combining these two effects, we can reach the parameter region suggested by QCD axion models.

 Recent neutron star surface observations corroborate a long-standing theory that neutron stars may be accelerated over extended periods after their birth. We analyze how these prolonged rocket-like accelerations, combined with rapid birth kicks, impact binary orbits. We find that even a small contribution of rocket kicks combined with instantaneous natal kicks can allow binaries to reach period--eccentricity combinations unattainable in standard binary evolution models. We propose these kick + rocket combinations as a new channel to form wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries such as Gaia NS1, as well as inducing stellar mergers months to years after a supernova to cause peculiar high-energy transients.

2024-07-30, **Supernova Polarization Signals From the Interaction with a Dense Circumstellar Disk**, Xudong Wen et.al., [2407.20720v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20720v1)

 There is increasing evidence that massive stars may exhibit an enhanced mass loss shortly before their termination explosion. Some of them also indicate the enhancement of their circumstellar matter (CSM) is not spherically symmetric. Supernova (SN) interacting with aspherical CSM could induce special polarization signals from multiple radiation components that deviate from spherical symmetry. We investigate the time-evolution of the continuum polarization induced by the SN ejecta interacting with a disk/torus-like CSM. Our calculation suggests that the interaction between the SN ejecta and an immediate disk-like CSM with a thin, homogenous density structure would produce a high continuum polarization, which may reach a peak level of $\sim$15\%. The interplay between the evolving geometry of the emitting regions and the time-variant flux ratio between the polar ejecta and the equatorial CSM interaction may produce a double-peaked feature in the polarization time sequence. A similar trend of the time evolution of the polarization is also found for a radially extended CSM disk that exhibits a wind-like density structure, with an overall relatively lower level of continuum polarization ($<2.5\%$) during the interaction process. We also identify a non-uniform temperature distribution along the radial direction of the CSM disk, which yields a strong wavelength dependence of the continuum polarization. These signatures provide a unique geometric diagnostic to explore the interaction process and the associated extreme mass loss of the progenitors of interacting transients.

2024-07-29, **Investigating the Electron Capture Supernova Candidate AT 2019abn with JWST Spectroscopy**, Sam Rose et.al., [2407.20430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20430v1)

 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened up a new window to study highly reddened explosive transients. We present results from late-time (1421 days post-explosion) JWST follow-up spectroscopic observations with NIRSpec and MIRI LRS of the intermediate luminosity red transient (ILRT) AT 2019abn located in the nearby Messier 51 galaxy (8.6 Mpc). ILRTs represent a mysterious class of transients which exhibit peak luminosities between those of classical novae and supernovae and which are known to be highly dust obscured. Similar to the prototypical examples of this class of objects, NGC 300 2008-OT and SN 2008S, AT 2019abn has an extremely red and dusty progenitor detected only in pre-explosion Spitzer/IRAC imaging at 3.6 and 4.5 micron and not in deep optical or near-infrared HST images. We find that late time observations of AT 2019abn from NEOWISE and JWST are consistent with the late time evolution of SN 2008S. In part because they are so obscured by dust, it is unknown what produces an ILRT with hypotheses ranging from high mass stellar merger events, non-terminal stellar outbursts, or terminal supernovae explosions through electron-capture in super-AGB stars. Our JWST observations show strong mid-IR Class C PAH features at 6.3 and 8.25 micron typical of carbon-rich post-AGB sources. These features suggest the dust around AT 2019abn, either pre-existing or newly formed in the ejecta, is composed of carbonaceous grains which are not typically observed around red supergiants. However, depending on the strength and temperature of hot bottom burning, SAGBs may be expected to exhibit a carbon-rich chemistry. Thus our JWST observations are consistent with AT 2019abn having an SAGB progenitor.

2024-07-29, **Galaxies and Their Environment at $z \gtrsim 10$ -- I: Primordial Chemical Enrichment, Accretion, Cooling, and Virialization of Gas in Dark Matter Halos**, William M. Hicks et.al., [2407.20429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20429v1)

 Recent observations made using the James Webb Space Telescope have identified a number of high-redshift galaxies that are unexpectedly luminous. In light of this, it is clear that a more detailed understanding of the high redshift, pre-reionization universe is required for us to obtain the complete story of galaxy formation. This study is the first in a series that seeks to tell the story of galaxy formation at $z \gtrsim 10$ using a suite of large-scale adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulations. Our machine-learning-accelerated surrogate model for Population III star formation and feedback, StarNet, gives us an unprecedented ability to obtain physically accurate, inhomogeneous chemical initial conditions for a statistically significant number of galaxies. We find that of the 12,423 halos in the mass range of $10^6\,\,M\_\odot < M\_\mathrm{vir} < 10^9\,\, M\_\odot$ that form in our fiducial simulation, $16\%$ are chemically enriched by Population III supernovae by $z\sim12$. We then profile and compare various cooling processes at the centers of halos, and find a complete absence of atomic cooling halos. All of our halos with central cooling gas are dominated by H$\_2$ cooling, metal cooling, or a mixture of the two, even in the presence of a strong H$\_2$-photodissociating Lyman-Werner background. We also find that gas accretion through the virial radius is not driven by cooling. We find that gas virialization in halos with $M\_\mathrm{vir}\gtrsim10^7\,\,M\_\odot$ is supported by bulk turbulent flows, and that thermal energy accounts for only a small fraction of the total kinetic energy. Because of this, the mean gas temperature is well below the virial temperature for these halos. We then compute the mass of gas that is available for Population II star formation, and infer star formation rates for each potential star-forming halo.

2024-07-29, **Late Jets, Early Sparks: Illuminating the Pre-Maximum Bumps in Superluminous Supernovae**, Ore Gottlieb et.al., [2407.20348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20348v1)

 Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) radiate $\gtrsim 10-100$ times more energy than ordinary stellar explosions, implicating a novel power source behind these enigmatic events. One frequently discussed source, particularly for hydrogen-poor (Type I) SLSNe, is a central engine such as a millisecond magnetar or accreting black hole. Both black hole and magnetar engines are expected to channel a fraction of their luminosity into a collimated relativistic jet. Using 3D relativistic hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the interaction of a relativistic jet, endowed with a luminosity $L\_{\rm j}\approx10^{45}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ and duration $t\_{\rm eng} \approx$ days compatible with those needed to power SLSNe, launched into the envelope of the exploding star. The jet successfully breaks through the expanding ejecta and its shocked cocoon powers ultraviolet/optical emission lasting several days after the explosion and reaching a peak luminosity $\gtrsim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a sizable fraction of $L\_{\rm j}$. This high radiative efficiency is the result of the modest adiabatic losses the cocoon experiences due to the low optical depths of the enlarged ejecta at these late times, e.g., compared to the more compact stars in gamma-ray bursts. The luminosity and temperature of the cocoon emission match those of the ``bumps'' in SLSNe light curves observed weeks prior to the optical maximum in many SLSNe. Confirmation of jet breakout signatures by future observations (e.g., days to weeks-long internal X-ray emission from the jet for on-axis observers, spectroscopy confirming large photosphere velocities $v/c \gtrsim 0.1$, or detection of a radio afterglow) would offer strong evidence for central engines powering SLSNe.
