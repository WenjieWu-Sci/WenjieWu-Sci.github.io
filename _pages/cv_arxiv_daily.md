2024-05-09, **In-medium changes of nucleon cross sections tested in neutrino-induced reactions**, B. Bogart et.al., [2405.05921v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05921v1)

 Historically studied in the context of heavy-ion collisions, the extent to which free nucleon-nucleon forces are modified in-medium remains undetermined by these data sets. Therefore, we investigate the impact of NN in-medium modifications on neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions using the GiBUU transport model. We find that including an in-medium lowering of the NN cross section and density dependence on $\Delta$ excitation improves agreement with MicroBooNE neutrino-argon scattering data. This is observed for both proton and neutral pion spectra in charged-current muon neutrino and neutral-current single pion production datasets. The impact of collision broadening of the $\Delta$ resonance is also investigated.

2024-05-09, **Performance evaluation of electron multiplier tubes as a high-intensity muon beam monitor**, Takashi Honjo et.al., [2405.05877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05877v1)

 Upgrade work towards increasing the beam intensity of the neutrino production beamline at J-PARC is underway. Tertiary muon beam monitoring is essential for stable operation of the beamline. Accordingly, we are planning to replace the present muon monitor detectors with electron multiplier tubes (EMTs). We investigated the linearity and radiation tolerance of EMTs using a 90 MeV electron beam at the Research Center for Electron Photon Science. EMTs show higher radiation tolerance than the Si sensors which are presently used as one of the muon monitor detectors for the T2K long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment at J-PARC. The signal yield decrease is found to be less than 10% after a beam irradiation equivalent to 132-days of operation at the future J-PARC beam power of 1.3 MW. The observed yield decrease is likely due to dynode deterioration, based on the results of a detailed investigation. The studies described here confirm that EMTs can be used as a high-intensity muon beam monitor.

2024-05-09, **Development, Characterization and Production of a novel Water-based Liquid Scintillator based on the Surfactant TRITON X-100**, Hans Th. J. Steiger et.al., [2405.05743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05743v1)

 Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) is a novel detector medium for particle physics experiments. Applications range from the use as hybrid Cherenkov/scintillation target in low-energy and accelerator neutrino experiments to large-volume neutron vetoes for dark matter detectors. Here, we present a novel WbLS featuring new components (the surfactant Triton-X and vitamin C for long-term stability), a new production recipe, and a thorough characterization of its properties. Moreover, based on neutron scattering data we are able to demonstrate that the pulse shape discrimination capabilities of this particular LS are comparable to fully-organic LAB based scintillators.

2024-05-09, **Parallelizing Air Shower Simulation for Background Characterization in IceCube**, Kevin Meagher et.al., [2405.05700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05700v1)

 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic kilometer neutrino telescope located at the Geographic South Pole. For every observed neutrino event, there are over $10^6$ background events caused by cosmic ray air shower muons. In order to properly separate signal from background, it is necessary to produce Monte Carlo simulations of these air showers. Although to-date, IceCube has produced large quantities of background simulation, these studies still remain statistics limited. The first stage of simulation requires heavy CPU usage while the second stage requires heavy GPU usage. Processing both of these stages on the same node will result in an underutilized GPU but using different nodes will encounter bandwidth bottlenecks. Furthermore, due to the power-law energy spectrum of cosmic rays, the memory footprint of the detector response often exceeded the limit in unpredictable ways. This proceeding presents new client-server code which parallelizes the first stage onto multiple CPUs on the same node and then passes it on to the GPU for photon propagation. This results in GPU utilization of greater than 90% as well as more predictable memory usage and an overall factor of 20 improvement in speed over previous techniques.

2024-05-09, **Matter Asymmetries in the $Z_N$ Dark matter -companion Models**, Shao-Long Chen et.al., [2405.05694v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05694v1)

 A class of $Z\_{N\geq 3}$-symmetric WIMP dark matter models that are characterized by the semi-annihilation into the companion of dark matter has been proposed in ref.~\cite{Guo:2021rre}, providing a mechanism to evade the stringent direct detection constraint. In this work, we point out that such models naturally provide the three Sakharov elements necessary for dark matter asymmetry, and moreover this asymmetry can be transferred to the visible sector with a proper link to the leptonic or quark sector. In our minimal $Z\_3$ example, the migration to the leptonic sector is via the asymmetric companion decay into neutrinos, and the lepton asymmetry can be further transferred to the quark sector. The CP violation parameter in the model is suppressed in the limit of static annihilation of dark matter, and the lift from thermal motion has been studied for the first time. A preliminary numerical analysis based on the Boltzmann equations shows that both correct relic density of dark matter and baryon asymmetry can be accommodated.

2024-05-09, **RELICS: a REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent elastic Scattering experiment**, Chang Cai et.al., [2405.05554v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05554v1)

 Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) provides a unique probe for neutrino properties Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent Scattering experiment (RELICS), a proposed reactor neutrino program using liquid xenon time projection chamber (LXeTPC) technology, aims to investigate the CEvNS process of antineutrinos off xenon atomic nuclei. In this work, the design of the experiment is studied and optimized based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. To achieve a sufficiently low energy threshold for CEvNS detection, an ionization-only analysis channel will be adopted for RELICS. A high emission rate of delayed electrons after a big ionization signal is the major background, leading to an analysis threshold of 120 photo-electrons in the CEvNS search. The second largest background, nuclear recoils induced by cosmic-ray neutrons, is suppressed via a passive water shield. The physics potential of RELICS was explored with a 32 kg-yr exposure at a baseline of 25 m from a reactor core with a 3 GW thermal power. In an energy range of 120 to 240 PEs, we the expected 13673.5 CEvNS and 2133.7 background events.The sensitivity of RELICS to the weak mixing angle was investigated at a low momentum transfer. Our study has shown that RELICS can further improve the constraints on the non-standard neutrino interaction (NSI) compared to the best results. RELICS set out to develop a powerful surface-level detection technology for low-energy neutrinos from reactors.

2024-05-08, **Quasielastic Lepton-Nucleus Scattering and the Correlated Fermi Gas Model**, Bhubanjyoti Bhattacharya et.al., [2405.05342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05342v1)

 The neutrino research program in the coming decades will require improved precision. A major source of uncertainty is the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei that serve as targets for such experiments. Broadly speaking, this interaction often depends, e.g., for charge-current quasi-elastic scattering, on the combination of ``nucleon physics", expressed by form factors, and ``nuclear physics", expressed by a nuclear model. It is important to get a good handle on both. We present a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas Model for electron-nucleus and charge-current quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. The implementation is used to compare separately form factors and nuclear model effects for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.

2024-05-08, **Solar neutrinos and leptonic spin forces**, Saeed Ansarifard et.al., [2405.05340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05340v1)

 We quantify the effects on the evolution of solar neutrinos of light spin-zero particles with pseudoscalar couplings to leptons and scalar couplings to nucleons. In this scenario the matter potential sourced by the nucleons in the Sun's matter gives rise to spin precession of the relativistic neutrino ensemble. As such the effects in the solar observables are different if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles. For Dirac neutrinos the spin-flavour precession results into left-handed neutrino to right-handed neutrino (i.e., active--sterile) oscillations, while for Majorana neutrinos it results into left-handed neutrino to right-handed antineutrino (i.e., active-active) oscillations. In both cases this leads to distortions in the solar neutrino spectrum which we use to derive constraints on the allowed values of the mediator mass and couplings via a global analysis of the solar neutrino data. In addition for Majorana neutrinos spin-flavour precession results into a potentially observable flux of solar electron antineutrinos at the Earth which we quantify and constrain with the existing bounds from Borexino and KamLAND.

2024-05-08, **Neutrinos and gamma rays from beta decays in an active galactic nucleus NGC 1068 jet**, Koichiro Yasuda et.al., [2405.05247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05247v1)

 We show that TeV neutrinos detected from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 can be explained by the beta decays of neutrons produced in photodisintegration of nuclei on ultraviolet photons in the jet. The photodisintergation of nuclei occurs at energies above a few PeV, which explains the 1-100 TeV energies of the observed neutrinos. The gamma-ray flux accompanying the beta decays is expected to be much lower than the neutrino flux, and it agrees well with the gamma-ray observations of NGC 1068. This scenario can be applicable to other jetted Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 4151. The flavor ratio studies could be a test of this beta decay jet scenario for gamma-ray deficit neutrino sources.

2024-05-08, **The Ghent Hybrid Model in NuWro: a new neutrino single-pion production model in the GeV regime**, Qiyu Yan et.al., [2405.05212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05212v1)

 Neutrino-induced single-pion production constitutes an essential interaction channel in modern neutrino oscillation experiments, with its products building up a significant fraction of the observable hadronic final states. Frameworks of oscillation analyses strongly rely on Monte Carlo neutrino event generators, which provide theoretical predictions of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Thus, it is crucial to integrate state-of-the-art single-pion production models with Monte Carlo simulations to prepare for the upcoming systematics-dominated landscape of neutrino measurements. In this work, we present the implementation of the Ghent Hybrid model for neutrino-induced single-pion production in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The interaction dynamics includes coherently-added contributions from nucleon resonances and a non-resonant background, merged into the pythia branching predictions in the deep-inelastic regime, as instrumented by NuWro. This neutrino-nucleon interaction model is fully incorporated into the nuclear framework of the generator, allowing it to account for the influence of both initial- and final-state nuclear medium effects. We compare the predictions of this integrated implementation with recent pion production data from accelerator-based neutrino experiments. The results of the novel model show improved agreement of the generator predictions with the data and point to the significance of the refined treatment of the description of pion-production processes beyond the $\Delta$ region.

2024-05-08, **Neutrino Oscillations as a Gravitational Wave Detector?**, Dominik Hellmann et.al., [2405.05000v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05000v1)

 Gravitational Waves (GWs) can alter the neutrino propagation distance and thus affect neutrino oscillations. This can result in a complete disappearance of the oscillatory behavior that competes with other sources of neutrino decoherence. We develop a set of criteria that determines under which conditions neutrino oscillations are sensitive to this effect, and discuss three concrete scenarios for neutrinos from astrophysical sources. We find that neutrino oscillations may probe so far unexplored regions of the GW parameter space.

2024-05-08, **Constraining the core radius and density jumps inside Earth using atmospheric neutrino oscillations**, Anuj Kumar Upadhyay et.al., [2405.04986v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04986v1)

 Atmospheric neutrinos can act as a tool to probe the interior of Earth using weak interactions, and can provide information complementary to that obtained from gravitational and seismic measurements. While passing through Earth, multi-GeV neutrinos encounter Earth matter effects due to the coherent forward scattering with the ambient electrons, which alter the neutrino oscillation probabilities. These matter effects depend upon the density distribution of electrons inside Earth, and hence, can be used to determine the internal structure of Earth. In this work, we employ a five-layered model of Earth where the layer densities and radii are modified, keeping the mass and moment of inertia of Earth unchanged and respecting the hydrostatic equilibrium condition. We use the proposed INO-ICAL detector as an example of an atmospheric neutrino experiment that can distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos efficiently in the multi-GeV energy range. Our analysis demonstrates the role such an experiment can play in simultaneously constraining the density jumps inside Earth and the location of the core-mantle boundary.

2024-05-08, **Formal Theory of Heavy Ion Double Charge Exchange Reactions**, Horst Lenske et.al., [2405.04978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04978v1)

 The theory of heavy ion double charge exchange (DCE) reactions $A(Z,N)\to A(Z\pm 2,N\mp 2)$ is recapitulated emphasizing the role of Double Single Charge Exchange (DSCE) and pion-nucleon Majorana DCE (MDCE) reactions. DSCE reactions are of second--order distorted wave character, mediated by isovector nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions. The DSCE response functions resemble the nuclear matrix elements (NME) of $2\nu 2\beta$ decay. The MDCE process proceeds by a dynamically generated effective rank-2 isotensor interaction, defined by off--shell pion--nucleon DCE scattering. In closure approximation pion potentials and two--nucleon correlations are obtained, similar to the neutrino potentials and the intranuclear exchange of Majorana neutrinos in $0\nu 2 \beta$ Majorana double beta decay (MDBD).

2024-05-09, **Quantum entanglement enables single-shot trajectory sensing for weakly interacting particles**, Zachary E. Chin et.al., [2405.05888v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05888v1)

 Sensors for mapping the trajectory of an incoming particle find important utility in experimental high energy physics and searches for dark matter. For a quantum sensing protocol that uses projective measurements on a multi-qubit sensor array to infer the trajectory of an incident particle, we show that entanglement can dramatically reduce the particle-sensor interaction strength $\theta$ required for perfect trajectory discrimination. Within an interval of $\theta$ above this reduced threshold, any unentangled sensor requires $\Theta(\log(1/\epsilon))$ repetitions of the protocol to estimate the particle trajectory with $\epsilon$ error probability, whereas an entangled sensor can succeed with zero error in a single shot.

2024-05-09, **A PAge-like Unified Dark Fluid Model**, Junchao Wang et.al., [2405.05798v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05798v1)

 The unified dark fluid model unifies dark matter and dark energy into a single component, providing an alternative and more concise framework for interpreting cosmological observations. We introduce a PAge-like Unified Dark Fluid (PUDF) model based on the PAge approximation (Huang 2020), which is parameterized by the age of the universe and an $\eta$ parameter indicating the deviation from Einstein-De Sitter Universe. The PUDF model shares many similar features of the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and can effectively describe the large-scale structure formation and late-time cosmic acceleration. We constrain the PUDF model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements including those from the most recent DESI 2024, the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and the Cosmic Chronometers compilation. Although the PUDF performs well in fitting all the cosmological datasets, the joint analysis of the data still favors the $\Lambda$CDM model over the PUDF model, according to the Bayesian evidence of model comparison.

2024-05-09, **Constraints on primordial black holes from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 events**, M. Andrés-Carcasona et.al., [2405.05732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05732v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBH) can efficiently form black hole binaries in the early universe. We update the resulting constraints on PBH abundance using data from the third observational run (O3) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. To capture a wide range of PBH scenarios, we consider a variety of mass functions, including critical collapse in the QCD epoch in the presence of non-Gaussianities. Applying hierarchical Bayesian analysis to a population binaries consisting of primordial and astrophysical black holes, we find that, in every scenario, the PBHs can make up at most $f\_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ of dark matter in the mass range $1-200~M\_\odot$. The shape and strength of the constraints are insensitive to the type of non-Gaussianities, the modifications to the mass function during the QCD epoch, or the modelling of the astrophysical PBH population.

2024-05-09, **Incoherent Fermionic Dark Matter Absorption with Nucleon Fermi Motion**, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., [2405.05728v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05728v1)

 We investigate the incoherent regime of the fermionic dark matter absorption by nuclei using the relativistic Fermi gas model and nuclear form factors. With the momentum transfer being roughly equal to the dark matter mass $m\_\chi$, the incoherent regime contributes significantly to the absorption process for $m\_\chi \gtrsim 100$ MeV with a spin-independent operator and for even smaller mass with a spin-dependent one. We also compare the situations for various target nuclei ($^{131}$Xe, $^{72}$Ge, $^{40}$Ar, $^{20}$Ne and $^4$He) that are typically used in the dark matter direct detection. A heavier nucleus actually has the advantage of probing the incoherent scattering of the fermionic absorption dark matter. Observing both the coherent and incoherent contributions would be an important justification of the fermionic dark matter absorption.

2024-05-08, **Optimal Celestial Bodies for Dark Matter Detection**, Rebecca K. Leane et.al., [2405.05312v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05312v1)

 A wide variety of celestial bodies have been considered as dark matter detectors. Which stands the best chance of delivering the discovery of dark matter? Which is the most powerful dark matter detector? We investigate a range of objects, including the Sun, Earth, Jupiter, Brown Dwarfs, White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars, Stellar populations, and Exoplanets. We quantify how different objects are optimal dark matter detectors in different regimes by deconstructing some of the in-built assumptions in these search sensitivities, including observation potential and particle model assumptions. We show how different objects can be expected to deliver corroborating signals. We discuss different search strategies, their opportunities and limitations, and the interplay of regimes where different celestial objects are optimal dark matter detectors.

2024-05-08, **A too-many dwarf satellite galaxies problem in the MATLAS low-to-moderate density fields**, Kosuke Jamie Kanehisa et.al., [2405.05303v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05303v1)

 Dwarf galaxy abundances can serve as discernment tests for models of structure formation. Previous small-scale tensions between observations and dark matter-only cosmological simulations may have been resolved with the inclusion of baryonic processes; however, these successes have been largely concentrated on the Local Group dwarfs the feedback models were initially calibrated on. We investigate whether the $\Lambda$CDM model can reliably reproduce dwarf abundances in the MATLAS low-to-moderate density fields that are centred upon early-type host galaxies beyond the Local Volume. We carried out mock observations of MATLAS-like fields with the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG-50. We used matching selection criteria and compared the properties of dwarfs contained within them with their MATLAS analogues. Although simulated MATLAS-like dwarfs demonstrate photometric properties that are consistent with the observed galaxy population and follow the same scaling relations, TNG50 underestimates the number of dwarf galaxies in isolated MATLAS fields at the 6 sigma level. This significance is maintained within crowded fields containing more than a single bright host. Our 55-62% estimate of the fraction of background galaxies is in agreement with estimates by MATLAS, but is wholly insufficient to alleviate this discrepancy in dwarf abundances. Any incompleteness in the observed fields further exacerbates this tension. We identified a "too-many-satellites" problem in $\Lambda$CDM, emphasising the need for the continued testing and refining of current models of galaxy formation in environments beyond the Local Group.

2024-05-08, **Diffusion-HMC: Parameter Inference with Diffusion Model driven Hamiltonian Monte Carlo**, Nayantara Mudur et.al., [2405.05255v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05255v1)

 Diffusion generative models have excelled at diverse image generation and reconstruction tasks across fields. A less explored avenue is their application to discriminative tasks involving regression or classification problems. The cornerstone of modern cosmology is the ability to generate predictions for observed astrophysical fields from theory and constrain physical models from observations using these predictions. This work uses a single diffusion generative model to address these interlinked objectives -- as a surrogate model or emulator for cold dark matter density fields conditional on input cosmological parameters, and as a parameter inference model that solves the inverse problem of constraining the cosmological parameters of an input field. The model is able to emulate fields with summary statistics consistent with those of the simulated target distribution. We then leverage the approximate likelihood of the diffusion generative model to derive tight constraints on cosmology by using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to sample the posterior on cosmological parameters for a given test image. Finally, we demonstrate that this parameter inference approach is more robust to the addition of noise than baseline parameter inference networks.

2024-05-08, **Electroweak Multiplets as Dark Matter candidates: A brief review**, Paolo Panci et.al., [2405.05087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05087v1)

 I provide a thorough review of the theoretical and experimental status of ElectroWeak multiplets as Dark Matter candidates, serving as the prototype of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) Dark Matter. Specifically, the examination includes both real SU(2) representations with zero hypercharge and complex ones with $Y\neq 0$. For the first time, all calculable thermal masses for scalar and fermionic WIMPs are computed, incorporating significant non-perturbative non-relativistic effects such as Sommerfeld enhancement and the formation of WIMP bound states. WIMP masses of few hundred TeV are shown to be compatible both with $s$-wave unitarity of the annihilation cross-section, and perturbativity. Additionally, a strategy is outlined for probing these scenarios in the next generation of experiments.

2024-05-08, **The Importance of Being Symmetric: Flat Rotation Curves from Exact Axisymmetric Static Vacuum Spacetimes**, Antonia Seifert et.al., [2405.04933v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04933v1)

 Starting from the vacuum Einstein Field Equations and a static axisymmetric ansatz, we find two new solutions describing an axisymmetric static vacuum spacetime with cylindrical symmetry: One of this exhibits an additional symmetry in $z$-direction and the other has $z$-coordinate dependent coefficients. In analogy to the Schwarzschild solution, these metrics describe a static vacuum spacetime and apply in similar settings except for the changed symmetry conditions. Analyzing the low-velocity limit corresponding to the Newtonian approximation of the Schwarzschild metric, we find an effective logarithmic potential. This yields flat rotation curves for test particles undergoing rotational motion within the spacetime described by the line elements, in contrast to Newtonian rotation curves. This analysis highlights how important the symmetry assumptions are for deriving general relativistic solutions.   One example of physical objects that are generally described in the static vacuum low-velocity limit (reducing to Newtonian gravity in the spherically symmetric case) and exhibit axial symmetry are disk galaxies. We show that symmetries and appropriate line elements that respect them are crucial to consider in such settings. In particular, the solutions presented here result in flat rotation curves without any need for dark matter. While these exact solutions are limited to static vacuum spacetimes, their application to physical galaxies relies on appropriate approximations. Nonetheless, they offer valuable insights into explanations for flat rotation curves in galaxies and their implications for dark matter.

2024-05-08, **Comparison of two different integration methods for the (1+1)-Dimensional Schrödinger-Poisson Equation**, Nico Schwersenz et.al., [2405.04924v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04924v2)

 We compare two different numerical methods to integrate in time spatially delocalized initial densities using the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation system as the evolution law. The basic equation is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an auto-gravitating potential created by the wave function density itself. The latter is determined as a solution of Poisson's equation modelling, e.g., non-relativistic gravity. For reasons of complexity, we treat a one-dimensional version of the problem whose numerical integration is still challenging because of the extreme long-range forces (being constant in the asymptotic limit). Both of our methods, a Strang splitting scheme and a basis function approach using B-splines, are compared in numerical convergence and effectivity. Overall, our Strang-splitting evolution compares favourably with the B-spline method. In particular, by using an adaptive time-stepper rather large one-dimensional boxes can be treated. These results give hope for extensions to two spatial dimensions for not too small boxes and large evolution times necessary for describing, for instance, dark matter formation over cosmologically relevant scales.

2024-05-08, **Investigating the accelerated expansion of the Universe through updated constraints on viable $f(R)$ models within the Palatini formalism**, Kumar Ravi et.al., [2405.04886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04886v1)

 The observed accelerated expansion of the Universe at present epoch can be explained by some of the $f(R)$ models without invoking the existence of dark energy or any other such exotic component in cosmic fluid. The $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism is relatively less explored in recent times with respect to their counterpart in metric formalism. We study seven $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism: Hu-Sawicki (two cases), Starobinsky, exponential, Tsujikawa, $f(R) = R -\beta /R^ n$, and $f(R)= R + \alpha \ln(R) - \beta$. Following standard statistical procedure and utilizing data sets: type Ia supernovae data, cosmic chronometer observations, baryonic acoustic oscillations data, data from H \textsc{ii} starburst galaxies, local measurements of the \emph{Hubble} parameter ($H\_{0}$), and distance priors of cosmic microwave background radiation data, we obtain constraints on the model parameters. When compared with the standard `lambda-cold dark matter model', for many data set combinations, the support for $f(R)$ models is significant. We obtain the relevant quantities for characterizing the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and these quantities are consistent with those obtained in a model-independent way by others. The curve of effective/total equation-of-state parameter, obtained from parameter constraints, clearly shows correct phases of the expansion history: the radiation-dominated epochs and the matter-dominated epochs, of the past, and the current accelerated expansion epoch eventually evolving to de-Sitter phase in the distant future. Overall, our results advocate in favour of pursuing $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism as a potential alternative for explaining accelerated expansion of the Universe.

2024-05-08, **Effect of dark matter interaction on hybrid star in the light of the recent astrophysical observations**, Suman Pal et.al., [2405.04856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04856v1)

 We have explored the effect of dark matter interaction on hybrid star (HS) in the light of recent astrophysical observational constraints. The presence of dark matter is assumed to be there in both the hadron as well as the quark sector. The dark matter particle interacts with both hadron and quark matter through the exchange of a scalar as well as a vector meson. The equation of state (EOS) of the hadron part is computed using the NL3 version of the relativistic mean field(RMF) model, whereas the quark part is taken care of using the well-known MIT Bag model with the vector interaction. We investigate the effect of the dark matter density and the mass of the dark matter particle on various observables like mass, radius, tidal deformability of the dark matter admixed hybrid star(DMAHS). In this study, we have noted an intriguing aspect that is the speed of sound in the DMAHS is insensitive to both the mass as well as the density of dark matter. We also observe a striking similarity in the variation of transition mass and its corresponding radius, as well as the maximum mass of neutron stars, with dark matter density and mass. We employ observational constraints from neutron stars to narrow down the allowed range of the parameters of dark matter.

2024-05-08, **Revisiting general dark matter-bound-electron interactions**, Jin-Han Liang et.al., [2405.04855v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04855v1)

 In this letter we revisit general dark matter (DM)-bound-electron interactions studied previously in the influential work of [Catena et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 033195 (2020)]. We derive the DM-electron response functions and find a crucial minus sign was missed for the second atomic response function $W\_2$ defined in that work. The minus sign has significant phenomenological consequences when explaining experimental bounds on specific DM scenarios. Furthermore, for the most general DM-electron nonrelativistic or relativistic interactions for DM with spin up to one, we find there are three DM response functions ($a\_{0,1,2}$) whose corresponding atomic response functions ($\widetilde W\_{0,1,2}$) are linear combinations of the four response functions ($W\_{1,2,3,4}$) given in that work, $$ \widetilde W\_0 = W\_1, \, \widetilde W\_2 = \|\mathbf{v}\_0^\perp\|^2 W\_1+ W\_3 - 2 {m\_e\, \mathbf{q}\cdot \mathbf{v}\_0^\perp \over \mathbf{q}^2} W\_2,\, \widetilde W\_3 = { (\mathbf{q}\cdot \mathbf{v}\_0^\perp)^2 \over \mathbf{q}^2} W\_1 + {m\_e^2 \over \mathbf{q}^2}W\_4 - 2 {m\_e\, \mathbf{q}\cdot \mathbf{v}\_0^\perp \over \mathbf{q}^2} W\_2. $$ Due to the minus sign correction for $W\_2$, there can be significant cancellations between the $W\_2$ and $W\_{3,4}$ terms, so that $\widetilde W\_{2,3}$ are dominated by the usual response function $W\_1$ in some cases. Ignoring the sign could thus result in misinterpretation of the experimental data in some DM scenarios. As an example, we show that the recent XENON1T constraint on the fermionic DM anapole moment is weakened by a factor of 2 or so. Many DM scenarios involving DM or electron axial-vector current can yield $W\_2$ and thus are potentially affected by the sign.

2024-05-08, **Thermal analysis of black hole in de Rham--Gabadadze--Tolley massive gravity in Barrow entropy framework**, Muhammad Yasir et.al., [2405.04833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04833v1)

 This study examines a recently hypothesized black hole solution in de Rham--Gabadadze--Tolley massive gravity. Firstly, we consider the negative cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure. We extract the thermodynamical properties such as Hawking temperature, heat capacity and Gibbs free energy using the Barrow entropy. We also obtain a new pressure associated to the perfect fluid dark matter and discuss the first-order van der Waals-like phase transition. This black hole's stability is investigated through specific heat and Gibbs free energy. Also, we analyze the thermodynamic curvatures behavior of black hole through geometry methods (Weinhold, Ruppeiner, Hendi-Panahiyah-Eslam-Momennia (HPEM), and geometrothermodynamics (GTD)).

 Large scale structure provides valuable information of the primordial perturbations that encode the secrets of the origin of the Universe. It is an essential step to map between observables and their initial coordinates, called Lagrangian space, from which primordial perturbations transfer their information to structures via linear theory. By using numerical simulations and state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques, we report the accuracy of estimating the Lagrangian coordinates of galaxies and galaxy clusters, represented by dark matter halos in various ranges of mass, and study the accuracy of this remapping on the angular momentum (spin) reconstruction. Our work shows that galaxy groups and clusters, represented by halos with mass $\gtrsim 10^{13}M\_\odot$, can be accurately remapped to Lagrangian space, and their spin reconstruction errors are dominated by the reconstructed initial gravitational potential. For all mass ranges, the errors of Lagrangian remapping, as well as redshift space distortions, play subdominant roles in estimating their angular momenta. This study explains the low correlation level between observed galaxy spins and reconstructed cosmic initial conditions and illustrates the potential of using angular momenta of cosmic structures to improve the reconstruction of primordial perturbations.

 Fuzzy dark matter is a promising alternative to the standard cold dark matter. It has quite recently been noticed, that they can not only successfully explain the large-scale structure in the Universe, but can also solve problems of position and flux anomalies in galaxy strong lensing systems. In this paper we focus on the perturbation of time delays in strong lensing systems caused by fuzzy dark matter, thus making an important extension of previous works. We select a specific system HS 0810+2554 for the study of time delay anomalies. Then, based on the nature of the fuzzy dark matter fluctuations, we obtain theoretical relationship between the magnitude of the perturbation caused by fuzzy dark matter, its content in the galaxy, and its de Broglie wavelength $\lambda \_{\mathrm{dB}}$. It turns out that, the perturbation of strong lensing time delays due to fuzzy dark matter quantified as standard deviation is $\sigma\_{\Delta t} \propto \lambda \_{\mathrm{dB}}^{1.5}$. We also verify our results through simulations. Relatively strong fuzzy dark matter fluctuations in a lensing galaxy make it possible to to destroy the topological structure of the lens system and change the arrival order between the saddle point and the minimum point in the time delays surface. Finally, we stress the unique opportunity for studying properties of fuzzy dark matter created by possible precise time delay measurements from strongly lensed transients like fast radio bursts, supernovae or gravitational wave signals.

 We present a set of controlled hydrodynamical simulations to study the effects of strong galactic outflows on the density and temperature structures, and associated X-ray signatures, of extra-planar and circumgalactic gas. We consider three initial state models, isothermal, isentropic, and rotating cooling-flow, for the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) into which the outflows are driven. The energy sources are either stellar winds and supernovae, or active galactic nuclei. We consider energy injection rates in the range $10^{40} < \dot{E}\_{\rm inj} <10^{44.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and compute the time-dependent soft X-ray (0.5-2 keV) surface brightness. For $\dot{E}\_{\rm inj} \gtrsim 10^{41} - 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with the exact threshold depending on the initial CGM state, the X-ray response is dominated by dense hot gas in the forward shock that eventually fades into the CGM as a sound wave. The shock surrounds an inner hot bubble leading to a radial flattening of the X-ray surface brightness. For lower energy injection rates, the X-ray surface brightness of the initial CGM state is almost unaffected. We present analytic approximations for the outflow shock propagation and the associated X-ray emissions.

 The unified dark fluid model unifies dark matter and dark energy into a single component, providing an alternative and more concise framework for interpreting cosmological observations. We introduce a PAge-like Unified Dark Fluid (PUDF) model based on the PAge approximation (Huang 2020), which is parameterized by the age of the universe and an $\eta$ parameter indicating the deviation from Einstein-De Sitter Universe. The PUDF model shares many similar features of the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and can effectively describe the large-scale structure formation and late-time cosmic acceleration. We constrain the PUDF model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements including those from the most recent DESI 2024, the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and the Cosmic Chronometers compilation. Although the PUDF performs well in fitting all the cosmological datasets, the joint analysis of the data still favors the $\Lambda$CDM model over the PUDF model, according to the Bayesian evidence of model comparison.

2024-05-09, **Modelling the galaxy radio continuum from star formation and active galactic nuclei in the Shark semi-analytic model**, Samuel P. Hansen et.al., [2405.05586v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05586v1)

 We present a model of radio continuum emission associated with star formation (SF) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) implemented in the Shark semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. SF emission includes free-free and synchrotron emission, which depend on the free-electron density and the rate of core-collapse supernovae with a minor contribution from supernova remnants, respectively. AGN emission is modelled based on the jet production rate, which depends on the black hole mass, accretion rate and spin, and includes synchrotron self-absorption. Shark reproduces radio luminosity functions (RLFs) at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz for 0 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 4, and scaling relations between radio luminosity, star formation rate and infrared luminosity of galaxies in the local and distant universe in good agreement with observations. The model also reproduces observed number counts of radio sources from 150 MHz to 8.4 GHz to within a factor of two on average, though larger discrepancies are seen at the very bright fluxes at higher frequencies. We use this model to understand how the radio continuum emission from radio-quiet AGNs can affect the measured RLFs of galaxies. We find current methods to exclude AGNs from observational samples result in large fractions of radio-quiet AGNs contaminating the "star-forming galaxies" selection and a brighter end to the resulting RLFs. We investigate how this effects the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) and show that AGN contamination can lead to evolution of the IRRC with redshift. Without this contamination our model predicts a redshift- and stellar mass-independent IRRC, except at the dwarf-galaxy regime.

2024-05-08, **Chemo-dynamical Evolution of Simulated Satellites for a Milky Way-like Galaxy**, Yutaka Hirai et.al., [2405.05330v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05330v1)

 The chemical abundances of Milky Way's satellites reflect their star formation histories (SFHs), yet, due to the difficulty of determining the ages of old stars, the SFHs of most satellites are poorly measured. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will obtain around ten times more medium-resolution spectra for stars in satellites than are currently available. To correctly extract SFHs from large samples of chemical abundances, the relationship between chemical abundances and SFHs needs to be clarified. Here, we perform a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with detailed models of star formation, supernova feedback, and metal diffusion. We quantify SFHs, metallicity distribution functions, and the $\alpha$-element (Mg, Ca, and Si) abundances in satellites of the host galaxy. We find that star formation in most simulated satellites is quenched before infalling to their host. Star formation episodes in simulated satellites are separated by a few hundred Myr owing to supernova feedback; each star formation event produces groups of stars with similar [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We then perform a mock observation of the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) observations. We find that Subaru PFS will be able to detect distinct groups of stars in [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space, produced by episodic star formation. This result means that episodic SFHs can be estimated from the chemical abundances of $\gtrsim$ 1,000 stars determined with medium-resolution spectroscopy.

2024-05-08, **Is the James Webb Space Telescope detecting too many AGN candidates?**, Melanie Habouzit et.al., [2405.05319v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05319v1)

 In less than two years of operation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already accelerated significantly our quest to identify active massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years of the Universe's history. At the time of writing, about 50 AGN detections and candidates have been identified through spectroscopy, photometry, and/or morphology. Broad-line AGN are about a hundred times more numerous than the faint end of the UV-bright quasar population at z~5-6. In this paper, we compare the observational constraints on the abundance of these AGN at z~5 to the populations of AGN produced in large-scale cosmological simulations. Assuming a null fraction of obscured simulated AGN, we find that while some simulations produce more AGN than discovered so far, some others produce a similar abundance or even fewer AGN in the bolometric luminosity range probed by JWST. Keeping in mind the large uncertainty on the constraints, we discuss the implications for the theoretical modeling of BH formation and evolution in case similar constraints continue to accumulate. At the redshift of interest, the simulated AGN populations diverge the most at Lbol~1e44 erg/s (by more than a dex in the bolometric luminosity function). This regime is most affected by incompleteness in JWST surveys. However, it holds significant potential for constraining the physical processes determining the assembly of BHs (e.g., seeding, feedback from supernova and AGN) and the current abundance of broad-line AGN with >1e44.5 erg/s.

2024-05-08, **Sedimentary rocks from Mediterranean drought in the Messinian age as a probe of the past cosmic ray flux**, Lorenzo Caccianiga et.al., [2405.04908v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04908v1)

 We propose the use of natural minerals as detectors to study the past flux of cosmic rays. This novel application of the \textit{paleo-detector} technique requires a specific approach as it needs samples that have been exposed to secondary cosmic rays for a well defined period of time. We suggest here the use of the evaporites formed during the desiccation of the Mediterranean sea ${\sim}6$ Myr ago. These minerals have been created and exposed to the air or under a shallow water basin for ${\sim}500$ kyr before being quickly submerged again by a km-scale overburden of water. We show that, by looking at the damages left in the minerals by muons in cosmic ray showers, we could detect differences in the primary cosmic ray flux during that period, as the ones expected from nearby supernova explosions, below the percent-level. We show also that little to no background from radioactive contamination and other astroparticles is expected for this kind of analysis.

2024-05-08, **A Gamma-ray Emitting Collisional Ring Galaxy System in our Galactic Neighborhood**, Vaidehi S. Paliya et.al., [2405.04898v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04898v1)

 The astrophysical $\gamma$-ray photons carry the signatures of the violent phenomena happening on various astronomical scales in our Universe. This includes supernova remnants, pulsars, and pulsar wind nebulae in the Galactic environment and extragalactic relativistic jets associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, $\sim$30\% of the \gm-ray sources detected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope lack multiwavelength counterpart association, precluding us from characterizing their origin. Here we report, for the first time, the association of a collisional ring galaxy system in our Galactic neighborhood (distance $\sim$10 Mpc), formed as a consequence of a smaller `bullet' galaxy piercing through a larger galaxy, as the multi-frequency counterpart of an unassociated $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL~J1647.5$-$5724. The system, also known as "Kathryn's Wheel", contains two dwarf irregular galaxies and an edge-on, late-type, spiral galaxy surrounded by a ring of star-forming knots. We utilized observations taken from the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory, Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, SuperCOSMOS H$\alpha$ Survey, Dark Energy Survey, and Visible MultiObject Spectrograph at Very Large Telescope to ascertain the association with 4FGL~J1647.5$-$5724 and to explore the connection between the star-forming activities and the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. We found that star-formation alone cannot explain the observed $\gamma$-ray emission, and additional contribution likely from the pulsars/supernova remnants or buried AGN is required. We conclude that arcsecond/sub-arcsecond-scale observations of this extraordinary $\gamma$-ray emitting galaxy collision will be needed to resolve the environment and explore the origin of cosmic rays.

2024-05-08, **Investigating the accelerated expansion of the Universe through updated constraints on viable $f(R)$ models within the Palatini formalism**, Kumar Ravi et.al., [2405.04886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04886v1)

 The observed accelerated expansion of the Universe at present epoch can be explained by some of the $f(R)$ models without invoking the existence of dark energy or any other such exotic component in cosmic fluid. The $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism is relatively less explored in recent times with respect to their counterpart in metric formalism. We study seven $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism: Hu-Sawicki (two cases), Starobinsky, exponential, Tsujikawa, $f(R) = R -\beta /R^ n$, and $f(R)= R + \alpha \ln(R) - \beta$. Following standard statistical procedure and utilizing data sets: type Ia supernovae data, cosmic chronometer observations, baryonic acoustic oscillations data, data from H \textsc{ii} starburst galaxies, local measurements of the \emph{Hubble} parameter ($H\_{0}$), and distance priors of cosmic microwave background radiation data, we obtain constraints on the model parameters. When compared with the standard `lambda-cold dark matter model', for many data set combinations, the support for $f(R)$ models is significant. We obtain the relevant quantities for characterizing the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and these quantities are consistent with those obtained in a model-independent way by others. The curve of effective/total equation-of-state parameter, obtained from parameter constraints, clearly shows correct phases of the expansion history: the radiation-dominated epochs and the matter-dominated epochs, of the past, and the current accelerated expansion epoch eventually evolving to de-Sitter phase in the distant future. Overall, our results advocate in favour of pursuing $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism as a potential alternative for explaining accelerated expansion of the Universe.

 Runaway stars are OB-type stars ejected from their birthplace with large peculiar velocities. The leading hypothesis addressed in their formation includes the supernova ejection mechanism and the dynamic ejection scenario. Identification of runaway populations is the first step to investigating their formation and evolution. Here we present our work of searching for Galactic runaway candidate stars from the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey DR8 database. After studying the kinematic properties for a collection of 4,432 early-type stars, predominantly B-type stars, using the radial velocity measurements from LAMOST DR8 and astrometric solutions made by Gaia DR3, we identified 229 runaway candidate stars. They span a wide distribution in projected rotational velocities. We investigated the Galactic spatial distribution of the runaway population and noticed that most of them likely reside within the Galactic thin disk. Based upon analyzing the Doppler shifts of the candidate stars, we found two binary runaway candidates displaying velocity variation with estimated orbital periods of 40 and 61 days.
