2024-03-28, **Measurement of double-differential cross sections for mesonless charged-current muon neutrino interactions on argon with final-state protons using the MicroBooNE detector**, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., [2403.19574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19574v1)

 Charged-current neutrino interactions with final states containing zero mesons and at least one proton are of high interest for current and future accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments. Using the Booster Neutrino Beam and the MicroBooNE detector at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, we have obtained the first double-differential cross section measurements of this channel for muon neutrino scattering on an argon target with a proton momentum threshold of 0.25 GeV/c. We also report a flux-averaged total cross section of $\sigma = (11.8 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{-38}$ cm$^2$ / Ar and several single-differential measurements which extend and improve upon previous results. Statistical and systematic uncertainties are quantified with a full treatment of correlations across 359 kinematic bins, including correlations between distributions describing different observables. The resulting data set provides the most detailed information obtained to date for testing models of mesonless neutrino-argon scattering.

2024-03-28, **Measuring Solar Neutrinos in the SNO+ Detector**, Daniel Cookman et.al., [2403.19532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19532v1)

 The SNO+ experiment is a large multi-purpose neutrino detector, currently filled with liquid scintillator. For the first time in a single experiment, SNO+ is able to measure the neutrino oscillation parameters $\theta\_{12}$ and $\Delta m^{2}\_{21}$ simultaneously through both reactor anti-neutrinos and $^{8}B$ solar neutrinos. The latter approach is demonstrated here, with an analysis of an initial 80 days of scintillator phase data. A Bayesian statistical approach via Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used, allowing for the simultaneous fitting of the oscillation parameters, $^{8}B$ neutrino flux, background components with constraints, and systematic uncertainties. The neutrino oscillation parameter $\theta\_{12}$ was measured to be $38.9^{\circ+8.0^{\circ}}\_{-7.9^{\circ}}$, assuming the current global fit flux of $^{8}B$ solar neutrinos. This is consistent with the current global fit result for $\theta\_{12}$. A sensitivity study shows that this measurement is statistics-limited, and precision could be improved by a factor of two with two years of livetime, assuming the same backgrounds and selections.

2024-03-28, **Impact of JLab data on the determination of GPDs at zero skewness and new insights from transition form factors $ N\rightarrow Δ$**, The MMGPDs Collaboration et.al., [2403.19384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19384v1)

 It is well established now that the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness are playing important roles in some physical process such as elastic electron-nucleon scattering, elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering, and wide-angle Compton scattering (WACS) via various types of form factors (FFs). In this study, we are going to utilize the recent JLab measurements of the elastic electron-nucleon scattering reduced cross-section, namely GMp12, as a touchstone to unravel the tension observed between the measurements of the WACS cross-section and the data of the proton magnetic FF $ G\_M^p $. We also investigate the impact of GMp12 data on valence unpolarized GPDs $ H\_v^q $ and $ E\_v^q $ at zero skewness by performing some $ \chi^2 $ analyses of the related experimental data. By calculating the electric and scalar quadrupole ratios, $ R\_{EM} $ and $ R\_{SM} $, and magnetic transition FF $ G^*\_M/3G\_D $ related to the nucleon-to-delta ($ N\rightarrow \Delta $) transition using the extracted GPDs and comparing the results with corresponding experimental measurements, we show that our results are in an excellent consistency with experiments, indicating the universality property of GPDs. We emphasize that the inclusion of these data in the future analysis of GPDs can significantly the extracted GPDs especially their uncertainties at smaller values of $ Q^2 $.

2024-03-28, **The SNO+ Journey to 0νββ**, A. S. Inácio et.al., [2403.19351v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19351v1)

 SNO+ is a large multipurpose experiment with the ultimate goal of searching for the neutrinoless double beta decay in $^{130}\mathrm{Te}$. After a commissioning phase with water as the target medium, during which acquired data allowed for measurements of solar neutrinos and the detection of reactor antineutrinos, SNO+ is now filled with 780 tonnes of liquid scintillator. The higher light yield of the scintillator enhances the physics capabilities of the experiment, and a physics program including reactor, geo and solar neutrinos is currently underway. The water and unloaded scintillator phases provide crucial commissioning milestones in preparation for the tellurium loading, such as calibrating the detector and making extensive background constraint measurements as components of the final scintillator cocktail are gradually added. In a first phase, 3900~kg of natural tellurium (0.5\%) will be added to the scintillator for a predicted sensitivity of about $2\times20^{26}$ years (90\% CL) with 3 years of livetime. Higher tellurium loading will follow for predicted sensitivities above $1\times10^{27}$ years (3\% loading).

2024-03-28, **Introducing scalar leptoquarks into a 3-3-1 model to solve the $(g-2)_μ$ puzzle**, A. Doff et.al., [2403.19338v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19338v1)

 In this work we introduce scalar leptoquarks into the 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos with the aim of solving the $(g-2)\_{\mu}$ puzzle. We show that besides the model supports leptoquarks in the octet, sextet, triplet and singlet representations, we identified that only one specif leptoquark in the singlet representation leads to flip of chirality as required to generate positive and robust contribution to the $(g-2)\_\mu$. Then we calculate its contributions to $(g-2)\_\mu$ and to the decay process $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ and discuss the results.

2024-03-28, **More on Black Holes Perceiving the Dark Dimension**, Luis A. Anchordoqui et.al., [2403.19604v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19604v1)

 In the last two years the dark dimension scenario has emerged as focal point of many research interests. In particular, it functions as a stepping stone to address the cosmological hierarchy problem and provides a colosseum for dark matter contenders. We reexamine the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. We re-assess limits on the abundance of PBHs as dark matter candidates from $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from Hawking evaporation. We re-evaluate constraints from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of the Galactic center which offer the best and most solid upper limits on the dark matter fraction composed of PBHs. The revised mass range which allows PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter is estimated to be $10^{15} \alt M\_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. We demonstrate that due to the constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission, quantum corrections due to the speculative memory burden effect do not modify this mass range. We also investigate the main characteristics of PBHs which are localized in the bulk. We show that PBHs localized in the bulk can make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \alt M\_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. Finally, we comment on the black holes that could be produced if one advocates a space with two boundaries for the dark dimension.

2024-03-28, **Implications of purity constraints on light higgsinos**, Stephen P. Martin et.al., [2403.19598v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19598v1)

 The lightest supersymmetric particles could be higgsinos that have a small mixing with gauginos. If the lightest higgsino-like state makes up some or all of the dark matter with a thermal freezeout density, then its mass must be between about 100 and 1150 GeV, and dark matter searches put bounds on the amount of gaugino contamination that it can have. Motivated by the generally good agreement of flavor- and CP-violating observables with Standard Model predictions, I consider models in which the scalar particles of minimal supersymmetry are heavy enough to be essentially decoupled, except for the 125 GeV Higgs boson. I survey the resulting purity constraints as lower bounds on the gaugino masses and upper bounds on the higgsino mass splittings. I also discuss the mild excesses in recent soft lepton searches for charginos and neutralinos at the LHC, and show that they can be accommodated in these models if $\tan\beta$ is small and $\mu$ is negative.

2024-03-28, **Non-Linear Matter Power Spectrum Modeling in Interacting Dark Energy Cosmologies**, Emanuelly Silva et.al., [2403.19590v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19590v1)

 Understanding the behavior of the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model is crucial for accurately predicting the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe in non-standard cosmologies. In this work, we present an analysis of the non-linear matter power spectrum within the framework of interacting dark energy-dark matter cosmologies (IDE). We employ N-body simulations and theoretical models to investigate the impact of IDE on these non-linear scales. Beginning with N-body simulations characterized by a fixed parameter space delineated by prior observational research, we adeptly fit the simulated spectra with a simple parametric function, achieving accuracy within 5\%. Subsequently, we refine a modified halo model tailored to the IDE cosmology, exhibiting exceptional precision in fitting the simulations down to scales of approximately 1 h/Mpc. To assess the model's robustness, we conduct a forecast analysis for the Euclid survey, employing our refined model. We find that the coupling parameter $\xi$ will be constrained to $\sigma(\xi) = 0.0046$. This marks a significant improvement by an order of magnitude compared to any other current observational tests documented in the literature. These primary findings pave the way for a novel preliminary approach, enabling the utilization of IDE models for observational constraints concerning LSS data on non-linear scales.

2024-03-28, **Probing the dark Universe with gravitational waves**, Antonio Enea Romano et.al., [2403.19552v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19552v1)

 Gravitational waves (GW) are expected to interact with dark energy and dark matter, affecting their propagation on cosmological scales. In order to model this interaction, we derive a gauge invariant effective equation and action valid for all GWs polarizations, based on encoding the effects of the interaction of GWs at different order in perturbations, in a polarization, frequency and time dependent effective speed. The invariance of perturbations under time dependent conformal transformations and the gauge invariance of the GWs allow to obtain the unitary gauge effective action in any conformally related frame, making transparent the relation between Einstein and Jordan frame. The propagation time and luminosity distance of different GWs polarizations allow to probe at different frequencies and redshift the dark Universe, which act as an effective medium, whose physical properties can be modeled by the GWs effective speed.

2024-03-28, **The Hierarchical Cosmic Web and Assembly Bias**, J. M. Coloma-Nadal et.al., [2403.19337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19337v1)

 Accurate modeling of galaxy distributions is paramount for cosmological analysis using galaxy redshift surveys. However, this endeavor is often hindered by the computational complexity of resolving the dark matter halos that host these galaxies. To address this challenge, we propose the development of effective assembly bias models down to small scales, i.e., going beyond the local density dependence capturing non-local cosmic evolution. We introduce a hierarchical cosmic web classification that indirectly captures up to third-order long- and short-range non-local bias terms. This classification system also enables us to maintain positive definite parametric bias expansions. Specifically, we subdivide the traditional cosmic web classification, which is based on the eigenvalues of the tidal field tensor derived, with an additional classification based on the Hessian matrix of the negative density contrast. We obtain the large-scale dark matter field on a mesh with $\sim3.9\,h^{-1}$ Mpc cell side resolution through Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. To assess the effectiveness of our model, we conduct tests using a reference halo catalogue extracted from the UNIT project simulation, which was run within a cubical volume of 1 $h^{-1}$ Gpc side. The resulting mock halo catalogs, generated trough our approach, exhibit a high level of accuracy in terms of the one-, two- and three-point statistics. They reproduce the reference power spectrum within better than 2 percent accuracy up to wavenumbers $k\sim0.8\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and provide accurate bispectra within the scales that are crucial for cosmological analysis. This effective bias approach provides a forward model appropriate for field-level cosmological inference and holds significant potential for facilitating cosmological analysis of galaxy redshift surveys, particularly in the context of projects such as DESI, EUCLID, and LSST.

2024-03-28, **Measuring the baryon fraction using galaxy clustering**, Alex Krolewski et.al., [2403.19236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19236v1)

 The amplitude of the baryon signature in galaxy clustering depends on the cosmological baryon fraction. We consider two ways to isolate this signal in galaxy redshift surveys. First, we extend standard template-based Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) models to include the amplitude of the baryonic signature by splitting the transfer function into baryon and cold dark matter components with freely varying proportions. Second, we include the amplitude of the split as an extra parameter in Effective Field Theory (EFT) models of the full galaxy clustering signal. We find similar results from both approaches. For the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data we find $f\_b\equiv\Omega\_b/\Omega\_m=0.173\pm0.027$ for template fits post-reconstruction, $f\_b=0.153\pm0.029$ for template fits pre-reconstruction, and $f\_b=0.154\pm0.022$ for EFT fits, with an estimated systematic error of 0.013 for all three methods. Using reconstruction only produces a marginal improvement for these measurements. Although significantly weaker than constraints on $f\_b$ from the Cosmic Microwave Background, these measurements rely on very simple physics and, in particular, are independent of the sound horizon. In a companion paper we show how they can be used, together with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis measurements of the physical baryon density and geometrical measurements of the matter density from the Alcock-Paczynski effect, to constrain the Hubble parameter. While the constraints on $H\_0$ based on density measurements from BOSS are relatively weak, measurements from DESI and Euclid will lead to errors on $H\_0$ that are competitive with those from local distance ladder measurements.

2024-03-28, **Radio imaging of gravitationally lensed radio-quiet quasars**, Neal Jackson et.al., [2403.19357v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19357v1)

 We present 6-GHz Very Large Array radio images of 70 gravitational lens systems at 300-mas resolution, in which the source is an optically-selected quasar, and nearly all of which have two lensed images. We find that about in half of the systems (40/70, with 33/70 secure), one or more lensed images are detected down to our detection limit of 20microJy/beam, similar to previous investigations and reinforcing the conclusion that typical optically-selected quasars have intrinsic GHz radio flux densities of a few microJy ($\sim10^{23}$WHz$^{-1}$) at redshifts of 1--2. In addition, for ten cases it is likely that the lensing galaxies are detected in the radio. Available detections of, and limits on the far-infrared luminosities from the literature, suggest that nearly all of the sample lie on the radio-FIR correlation typical of star-forming galaxies, and that their radio luminosities are at least compatible with the radio emission being produced by star formation processes. One object, WISE2329$-$1258, has an extra radio component that is not present in optical images, and is difficult to explain using simple lens models. In-band spectral indices, where these can be determined, are generally moderately steep and consistent with synchrotron processes either from star-formation/supernovae or AGN. Comparison of the A/B image flux ratios at radio and optical wavelengths suggests a 10 per cent level contribution from finite source effects or optical extinction to the optical flux ratios, together with sporadic larger discrepancies that are likely to be due to optical microlensing.

2024-03-28, **A new method to determine $H_0$ from cosmological energy-density measurements**, Alex Krolewski et.al., [2403.19227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19227v1)

 We introduce a new method for measuring the Hubble parameter from low-redshift large-scale observations that is independent of the comoving sound horizon. The method uses the baryon-to-photon ratio determined by the primordial deuterium abundance, together with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations and the present-day CMB temperature to determine the physical baryon density $\Omega\_b h^2$. The baryon fraction $\Omega\_b/\Omega\_m$ is measured using the relative amplitude of the baryonic signature in galaxy clustering measured by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, scaling the physical baryon density to the physical matter density. The physical density $\Omega\_mh^2$ is then compared with the geometrical density $\Omega\_m$ from Alcock-Paczynski measurements from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and voids, to give $H\_0$. Including type Ia supernovae and uncalibrated BAO, we measure $H\_0 = 67.1^{+6.3}\_{-5.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We find similar results when varying analysis choices, such as measuring the baryon signature from the reconstructed correlation function, or excluding supernovae or voids. This measurement is currently consistent with both the distance-ladder and CMB $H\_0$ determinations, but near-future large-scale structure surveys will obtain 3--4$\times$ tighter constraints.
