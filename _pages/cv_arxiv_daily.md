2024-03-27, **Identifying CP Basis Invariants in SMEFT**, Neda Darvishi et.al., [2403.18732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18732v1)

 Building on our automated framework that uses ring diagrams for classifying CP basis invariants [1], this paper broadens the application of the methodology with more extensive examples and a wider scope of theoretical frameworks. Here, we showcase its versatility through detailed analyses in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) up to dim-2n, and SMEFT with sterile neutrinos ({\nu}SMEFT) up to dimension-7. By integrating the ring-diagram technique with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we have developed a system that not only simplifies the process of identifying basic and joint invariants but also enables the automatic differentiation between CP-even and CP-odd invariants from the lowest orders. Additionally, this work presents a comparison of our results with those derived using the traditional Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and its Plethystic logarithm. While these conventional approaches primarily yield the numerical count of invariants, our framework provides a complete structure of invariants, thereby surpassing the limitations of these traditional methods.

2024-03-27, **Late-forming black holes and the antiproton, gamma-ray, and anti-helium excesses**, Mrunal Korwar et.al., [2403.18656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18656v1)

 Black holes long-lived enough to be the dark matter have temperatures below the MeV. Since Hawking evaporation is a quasi-thermal process, no GeV emission is predicted to be produced by black holes if they are part, or all, of the cosmological dark matter. However, black holes could be ``spawned'' at late times with masses that correspond to short lifetimes, and as such be significantly hotter and produce particles well in excess of the GeV. Here, we show that such late-forming black holes could, at once, explain the tantalizing excesses found in the gamma radiation from the Galactic center, in the flux of cosmic-ray antiproton, and in the few tentative antihelium events reported by the anti-matter spectrometer AMS-02. We compute accurate predictions for the anti-deuteron, high-energy neutrino, and positron fluxes if this scenario is realized in nature. We find that while the neutrino and positron fluxes are too small compared to the expected background, a significant number of anti-deuteron events is expected both at AMS-02 and at the future General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS).

2024-03-27, **Flavored leptogenesis from a sudden mass gain of right-handed neutrinos**, Zhen-hua Zhao et.al., [2403.18630v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18630v1)

 In this paper, we would like to point out that in the scenario that the right-handed neutrinos suddenly gain some masses much larger than the temperature of the Universe at that time so that the washout effects for the generated lepton asymmetry can be safely neglected, the flavored leptogenesis (which crucially rely on the flavor non-universality of the washout effects) cannot work in the usual way any more. For this problem, we put forward that the flavor non-universality of the conversion efficiencies from the lepton asymmetry to the baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron processes may play a crucial role. And we will study if the requisite baryon asymmetry can be successfully reproduced from such a mechanism in the scenarios that the right-handed neutrino masses are hierarchical and nearly degenerate, respectively. A detailed study shows that this mechanism can be viable in both these two scenarios.

2024-03-26, **Development and property study of the extremely thin 12 \texorpdfstring{$Î¼m$} C-type straw tubes with 5-mm diameter for a Straw Tracker System of COMET**, N. Tsverava et.al., [2403.18097v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18097v1)

 The COMET experiment focuses on searching for the direct conversion of a muon into an electron with aluminum nuclei, without emitting a neutrino (so called $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion). This conversion violates charged lepton flavor conservation law, a fundamental principle in the Standard Model. The COMET experiment requirement is to achieve the muon-to-electron conversation sensitivity better than $10^{-17}$. The Straw Tracker System (STS) based on straw tubes could provide the necessary spatial resolution of 100 $\mu$m and the electron momentum resolution better than 100 MeV/c   The COMET phase-II will operate with 56 kW 8 GeV proton beam increasing from 3.2 kW 8GeV proton beam proposed for COMET phase-I. The 10-mm straws system was developed for COMET-phase-I and wouldn't perform with full efficiency with 20 times increased intensity. New STT design based on 5-mm 12-$\mu$m thick straws could satisfy the requirement of increased intensity. This detector should also operate in vacuum with 1 bar internal pressure. The mechanical properties of these straws such as sagging, elongation, dependence of the diameter on over-pressure, etc are discussed in this article.

2024-03-26, **Estimating the detection of antineutrinos in the future Brazilian neutron source**, Luiz Paulo de Oliveira et.al., [2403.17812v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17812v1)

 In line with the tradition of employing nuclear reactors for neutrino physics research, we present potential experiments that could be undertaken using the new Brazilian neutron source, the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB). This upcoming facility has clearly defined objectives, including the production of radiopharmaceuticals for the healthcare system, material irradiation testing, and research using neutron beams to investigate the micro and mesostructures of various materials. However, we anticipate that the RMB will generate up to $15,500$ antineutrinos daily, potentially expanding the facility's scope to include neutrino physics experiments involving beta and inverse beta reactions. The modern operational conditions of the RMB and its location in the Iper\'o-Brazil region may also enable neutrino oscillation experiments and the determination of the $\theta\_{13}$ parameter, as well as support safeguards activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), allowing for the monitoring of nuclear fuel burning cycles and isotope fractions. We discuss the potential utilization of the RMB as an antineutrino source, proposing experiments and addressing associated technical limitations.

2024-03-26, **Low-energy elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering in covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory**, Jin-Man Chen et.al., [2403.17743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17743v1)

 The low-energy antineutrino- and neutrino-nucleon neutral current elastic scattering is studied within the framework of the relativistic SU(2) baryon chiral perturbation theory up to the order of $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We have derived the model-independent hadronic amplitudes and extracted the form factors from them. It is found that differential cross sections ${{\rm d} \sigma}/{{\rm d} Q^2}$ for the processes of (anti)neutrino-proton scattering are in good agreement with the existing MiniBooNE data in the $Q^2$ region $[0.13,0.20]$ GeV$^2$, where nuclear effects are expected to be negligible. For $Q^2\leq 0.13$ GeV$^2$, large deviation is observed, which is mainly owing to the sizeable Pauli blocking effect. Comparisons with the simulation data produced by the NuWro and GIENE Mento Carlo events generators are also discussed. The chiral results obtained in this work can be utilized as inputs in various nuclear models to achieve the goal of precise determination of the strangeness axial vector form factor, in particular when the low-energy MicroBooNE data are available in the near future.

2024-03-26, **The Unified Era: An understanding journey from observations to the Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei**, Leonardo de Lima Santos et.al., [2403.17739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17739v1)

 The Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei (UMAGN) is a comprehensive theoretical framework aimed at elucidating the diverse observations of AGN, encompassing quasars and Seyfert galaxies. The Model attributes the observed variations to different orientations of a surrounding matter disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH), with the primary factor influencing observational diversity being the alignment of the AGN with the observer's line of sight. We present a comprehensive overview of the observational evidence, empirical and theoretical research, tracing key milestones that led to a unified perspective. We encapsulate the scientific journey culminating in the proposal of the UMAGN, including insights into the accretion disk, torus, and relativistic jet, and emphasize the properties of objects within UMAGN. Additionally, we underscore recent progress in multimessenger research involving electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves, astroparticles, and neutrinos, notably through collaborations such as the Event Horizon Telescope, LIGO/Virgo, IceCube, Pierre Auger, and KM3Net. We argue that these advancements present opportunities to enhance and refine UMAGN, contributing to a deeper understanding of AGNs and their implications for the formation and evolution of galaxies. The convergence of observational and theoretical research, coupled with emerging multimessenger techniques, paves the way for further strides in comprehending these enigmatic cosmic phenomena.

2024-03-26, **Nuclear matrix elements of neutrinoless double-beta decay in covariant density functional theory with different mechanisms**, C. R. Ding et.al., [2403.17722v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17722v1)

 Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay in candidate nuclei play a crucial role in interpreting results from current experiments and in designing future ones. Accurate NME values serve as important nuclear inputs for constraining parameters in new physics, such as neutrino mass and the Wilson coefficients of lepton-number-violating (LNV) operators. In this study, we present a comprehensive calculation of NMEs for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{100}$Mo, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using nuclear wave functions obtained from multi-reference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT). We employ three types of transition potentials at the leading order in chiral effective field theory. Our results, along with recent data, are utilized to constrain the coefficients of LNV operators. We find that NMEs for the standard and short-range mechanisms are significantly larger than those for the non-standard long-range mechanism. The use of NMEs from various nuclear models does not notably change the parameter space intervals for the coefficients, although MR-CDFT yields the most stringent constraint. Furthermore, our NMEs can also be used to perform a more comprehensive analysis with multiple isotopes.

2024-03-26, **Dynamical origin of neutrino masses and dark matter from a new confining sector**, Maximilian Berbig et.al., [2403.17488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17488v1)

 A dynamical mechanism, based on a confining non-abelian dark symmetry, which generates Majorana masses for hypercharge-less fermions, is proposed. We apply it to the inverse seesaw scenario, which allows to generate light neutrino masses from the interplay of TeV-scale Pseudo-Dirac mass terms and a small explicit breaking of lepton number. A single generation of vector-like dark quarks, transforming under a $\text{SU}(3)\_\text{D}$ gauge symmetry, is coupled to a real singlet scalar, which serves as a portal between the dark quark condensate and three generations of heavy sterile neutrinos. Such a dark sector and the Standard Model (SM) are kept in thermal equilibrium with each other via sizeable Yukawa couplings to the heavy neutrinos. In this framework the lightest dark baryon, which has spin $3/2$ and is stabilized at the renormalizable level by an accidental dark baryon number symmetry, can account for the observed relic density via thermal freeze-out from annihilations into the lightest dark mesons. These mesons in turn decay to heavy neutrinos, which produce SM final states upon decay. This model may be probed by next generation neutrino telescopes via neutrino lines produced from dark matter annihilations.

2024-03-27, **Constraining primordial non-Gaussianity from the large scale structure two-point and three-point correlation functions**, Z. Brown et.al., [2403.18789v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18789v1)

 Surveys of cosmological large-scale structure (LSS) are sensitive to the presence of local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), and may be used to constrain models of inflation. Local PNG, characterized by fNL, the amplitude of the quadratic correction to the potential of a Gaussian random field, is traditionally measured from LSS two-point and three-point clustering via the power spectrum and bi-spectrum. We propose a framework to measure fNL using the configuration space two-point correlation function (2pcf) monopole and three-point correlation function (3pcf) monopole of survey tracers. Our model estimates the effect of the scale-dependent bias induced by the presence of PNG on the 2pcf and 3pcf from the clustering of simulated dark matter halos. We describe how this effect may be scaled to an arbitrary tracer of the cosmological matter density. The 2pcf and 3pcf of this tracer are measured to constrain the value of fNL. Using simulations of luminous red galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we demonstrate the accuracy and constraining power of our model, and forecast the ability to constrainfNL to a precision of sigma(fNL) = 22 with one year of DESI survey data.

2024-03-27, **Effects of Dark Matter on $f$-mode oscillations of Neutron Stars**, Swarnim Shirke et.al., [2403.18740v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18740v1)

 The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of dark matter (DM) on $f$-mode oscillations in DM admixed neutron stars (NSs). We consider hadronic matter modeled by the relativistic mean field model and the DM model based on the neutron decay anomaly. We study the non-radial $f$-mode oscillations for such DM admixed NS in a full general relativistic framework. We investigate the impact of DM, DM self-interaction, and DM fraction on the $f$-mode characteristics. We derive relations encoding the effect of DM on $f$-mode parameters. We then perform a systematic study by varying all the model parameters within their known uncertainty range and obtain a universal relation for the DM fraction based on the total mass of the star and DM self-interaction strength. We also perform a correlation study among model parameters and NS observables, in particular, $f$-mode parameters. Finally, we check the $f$-mode universal relations (URs) for the case of DM admixed NSs and demonstrate the existence of a degeneracy between purely hadronic NSs and DM admixed NSs.

2024-03-27, **Can the splashback radius be an observable boundary of galaxy clusters?**, ThÃ©o Lebeau et.al., [2403.18648v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18648v1)

 The splashback radius was proposed as a physically motivated boundary of clusters as it sets the limit between the infalling and the orbitally dominated regions. However, galaxy clusters are complex objects connected to filaments of the cosmic web from which they accrete matter that disturbs them and modifies their morphology. In this context, estimating the splashback radius and the cluster boundary becomes challenging. In this work, we use a constrained hydrodynamical simulation of the Virgo cluster's replica embedded in its large-scale structure to investigate the impact of its local environment on the splashback radius estimate. We identify the splashback radius from 3D radial profiles of dark matter density, baryons density, and pressure in three regions representative of different dynamical states: accretion from spherical collapse, filaments, and matter outflow. We also identify the splashback radius from 2D-projected radial profiles of observation-like quantities: mass surface density, emission measure, and Compton-y. We show that the splashback radius mainly depends on the dynamics in each region and the physical processes traced by the different probes. We find multiple values for the splashback radius ranging from 3.3$\pm$0.2 to 5.5$\pm$0.3 Mpc. Particularly, in the regions of collapsing and outflowing material, the splashback radii estimated from baryon density and pressure radial profiles overestimate that of the dark matter density profiles, which is considered the reference value originally defined from dark matter simulations. Consequently, caution is required when using the splashback radius as a boundary of clusters, particularly in the case of highly disturbed clusters like Virgo. We also discuss the detection of the splashback radius from pressure radial profiles, which could be more related to an accretion shock, and its detection from stacked radial profiles.

2024-03-27, **Velocity Distribution of Dark Matter Spike around Schwarzschild Black Holes and Effects on Gravitational Waves from EMRIs**, Zi-Chang Zhang et.al., [2403.18529v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18529v1)

 Dark matter (DM) constitutes the predominant portion of matter in our universe. Despite compelling evidence, the precise characteristics of DM remain elusive. Among the leading DM candidates are weakly interacting massive particles, which may aggregate into steep concentrations around the central black holes of galaxies, forming dense spikes. Employing Schwarzschild geometry, we assess the density and velocity distribution of DM within such spikes. Through variations in black hole masses and dark halo parameters, we identify universal features in the density profile of DM and fit them with Gaussian distributions. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dynamical friction on gravitational waves (GWs) generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) within DM spikes. Our findings uncover phase shifts in the time-domain waveform, potentially providing significant insights for the GW-based detection of DM in galactic centers.

2024-03-26, **The Relevance of Dynamical Friction for the MW/LMC/SMC Triple System**, Wolfgang Oehm et.al., [2403.17999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17999v1)

 Simulations of structure formation in the standard cold dark matter cosmological model quantify the dark matter halos of galaxies. Taking into account dynamical friction between the dark matter halos, we investigate the past orbital dynamical evolution of the Magellanic Clouds in the presence of the Galaxy. Our calculations are based on a three-body model of rigid Navarro-Frenk-White profiles for the dark matter halos, but were verified in a previous publication by comparison to high-resolution N-body simulations of live self-consistent systems. Under the requirement that the LMC and SMC had an encounter within 20 kpc between 1 and 4 Gyr ago, in order to allow the development of the Magellanic Stream, and using the latest astrometric data, the dynamical evolution of the MW/LMC/SMC system is calculated backwards in time. With the employment of the genetic algorithm and a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method, the present state of this system is unlikely with a probability of <10^{-9} (6 sigma complement), because solutions found do not fit into the error bars for the observed plane-of-sky velocity components of the Magellanic Clouds. This implies that orbital solutions that assume dark matter halos according to cosmological structure formation theory to exist around the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way are not possible with a confidence of more than 6 sigma

2024-03-26, **Searching for large dark matter clumps using the Galileo Satnav clock variations**, Bruno Bertrand et.al., [2403.17890v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17890v1)

 This study presents bounds on transient variations of fundamental constants, with typical timescales ranging from minutes to months, using clocks in space. The underlying phenomenology describing such transient variations relies on models for Dark Matter (DM) which suggest possible encounters of macroscopic compact objects with the Earth, due to the motion of the solar system in the galactic halo. If such compact objects possess an effective feeble interaction with the ordinary matter beyond the gravitational one, it may result in effective transient variations of fundamental constants. Such variations leave signatures on clocks onboard GNSS satellites. In this paper, we introduce a phenomenological study dedicated to the search for such DM transient objects using the network of passive hydrogen masers (H-Masers) onboard Galileo satellites. We first model the signature of transient variations of fundamental constants as a frequency modulation in the difference between two satellite clocks, considering the satellite trajectories relative to the transient event. Then, we present first results based on a fast analysis method, the maximum reach analysis. The main result is a significant extension of the discovery range for DM transients, with a sensitivity never achieved before. We investigate indeed the range of transient sizes from $10^5$ to $10^9$ kilometres, which, apart from indirect and model-dependent non-transient effects, has never been explored previously.

2024-03-26, **Cosmology of axion dark matter**, Ciaran A. J. O'Hare et.al., [2403.17697v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17697v1)

 I present an introduction and topical review on axions as a dark matter candidate. Emphasis is placed on issues surrounding the cosmology of axion dark matter that are relevant for present-day searches, including: early-Universe production mechanisms, predictions of the axion mass, bounds on axion properties derived from cosmological data, as well as the direct and indirect detection of relic axion populations.

2024-03-26, **Constraining Primordial Non-Gaussianity from Large Scale Structure with the Wavelet Scattering Transform**, Matteo Peron et.al., [2403.17657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17657v1)

 We investigate the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) as a tool for the study of Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) in Large Scale Structure (LSS), and compare its performance with that achievable via a joint analysis with power spectrum and bispectrum (P+B). We consider the three main primordial bispectrum shapes - local, equilateral and orthogonal - and produce Fisher forecast for the corresponding fNL amplitude parameters, jointly with standard cosmological parameters. We analyze simulations from the publicly available "Quijote" and "Quijote-png" N-body suites, studying both the dark matter and halo fields. We find that the WST outperforms the power spectrum alone on all parameters, both on the fNL's and on cosmological ones. In particular, on fNL\_loc for halos, the improvement is about 27%. When B is combined with P, halo constraints from WST are weaker for fNL\_loc (at ~ 15% level), but stronger for fNL\_eq (~ 25%) and fNL\_ortho (~ 28%). Our results show that WST, both alone and in combination with P+B, can improve the extraction of information on PNG from LSS data over the one attainable by a standard P+B analysis. Moreover, we identify a class of WST in which the origin of the extra information on PNG can be cleanly isolated.

2024-03-26, **The Physical Origin of the Mass-Size Relation and Its Scatter of Disk Galaxies**, Min Du et.al., [2403.17313v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17313v1)

 Utilizing a kinematic decomposition of simulated galaxies, we focus on galaxies with tiny kinematically inferred stellar halos, indicative of weak external influences. We investigate the intricate interplay between internal (natural) and external (nurture) processes in shaping the scaling relationships of specific angular momentum ($j\_\star$), stellar mass ($M\_\star$), and size of disk galaxies within the IllustrisTNG simulation. The correlation among mass, size, and angular momentum of galaxies is examined by comparing simulations with observations and the theoretical predictions of the exponential hypothesis. Galaxies with tiny stellar halos exhibit a large scatter in the $j\_\star$-$M\_\star$ relation, which suggests that it is inherently present in their initial conditions. The analysis reveals that the disks of these galaxies adhere to the exponential hypothesis, resulting in a tight fiducial $j\_\star$-$M\_\star$-scale length (size) relation that is qualitatively consistent with observations. The inherent scatter in $j\_\star$ provides a robust explanation for the mass-size relation and its substantial variability. Notably, galaxies that are moderately influenced by external processes closely adhere to a scaling relation akin to that of galaxies with tiny stellar halos. This result underscores the dominant role of internal processes in shaping the overall $j\_\star$-$M\_\star$ and mass-size relation, with external effects playing a relatively minor role in disk galaxies. Furthermore, the correlation between galaxy size and the virial radius of the dark matter halo exists but fails to provide strong evidence of the connection between galaxies and their parent dark matter halos.

2024-03-27, **Supernova Archaeology with X-Ray Binary Winds -- The Case of GRO J1655-40**, Noa Keshet et.al., [2403.18689v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18689v1)

 Supernovae are responsible for the elemental enrichment of the galaxy and some are postulated to leave behind a black hole. In a stellar binary system the supernova pollutes its companion, and the black hole can accrete back its own debris and emit X-rays. In this sequence of events, which is only poorly understood, winds are ejected, and observed through X-ray absorption lines. Measuring abundances of elements in the wind can lead to inferences about the historical explosion and possibly identify the long-gone progenitor of the compact object. Here, we re-analyze the uniquely rich X-ray spectrum of the 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40. We reconstruct the absorption measure distribution (AMD) of the wind, and find that it increases sharply with ionization from H-like O up to H-like Ca, and then flattens out. The AMD is then used to measure relative abundances of 18 different elements. The present abundances are in partial agreement with a previous work with discrepancies mostly for low-Z elements. The overabundance of odd-Z elements hints at a high-metallicity, high-mass ($\simeq25\,M\_\odot$) progenitor. Interestingly, the abundances are different from those measured in the companion atmosphere, indicating that the wind entrains lingering ambient supernova debris. This can be expected since the current total stellar mass of the binary ($<10\,M\_\odot$) is much less than the progenitor mass.

2024-03-26, **Magnetars as Powering Sources of Gamma-Ray Burst Associated Supernovae, and Unsupervised Clustering of Cosmic Explosions**, Amit Kumar et.al., [2403.18076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18076v1)

 We present the semi-analytical light curve modelling of 13 supernovae associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRB-SNe) along with two relativistic broad-lined (Ic-BL) SNe without GRBs association (SNe 2009bb and 2012ap), considering millisecond magnetars as central-engine-based power sources for these events. The bolometric light curves of all 15 SNe in our sample are well-regenerated utilising a $\chi^2-$minimisation code, $\texttt{MINIM}$, and numerous parameters are constrained. The median values of ejecta mass ($M\_{\textrm{ej}}$), magnetar's initial spin period ($P\_\textrm{i}$) and magnetic field ($B$) for GRB-SNe are determined to be $\approx$ 5.2 M$\_\odot$, 20.5 ms and 20.1 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ G, respectively. We leverage machine learning (ML) algorithms to comprehensively compare the 3-dimensional parameter space encompassing $M\_{\textrm{ej}}$, $P\_\textrm{i}$, and $B$ for GRB-SNe determined herein to those of H-deficient superluminous SNe (SLSNe-I), fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), long GRBs (LGRBs), and short GRBs (SGRBs) obtained from the literature. The application of unsupervised ML clustering algorithms on the parameters $M\_{\textrm{ej}}$, $P\_\textrm{i}$, and $B$ for GRB-SNe, SLSNe-I, and FBOTs yields a classification accuracy of $\sim$95%. Extending these methods to classify GRB-SNe, SLSNe-I, LGRBs, and SGRBs based on $P\_\textrm{i}$ and $B$ values results in an accuracy of $\sim$84%. Our investigations show that GRB-SNe and relativistic Ic-BL SNe presented in this study occupy different parameter spaces for $M\_{\textrm{ej}}$, $P\_\textrm{i}$, and $B$ than those of SLSNe-I, FBOTs, LGRBs and SGRBs. This indicates that magnetars with different $P\_\textrm{i}$ and $B$ can give birth to distinct types of transients.

 In previous work we have shown that the dipole in the low redshift supernovae of the Pantheon+SH0ES data does not agree with the one inferred from the velocity of the solar system as obtained from CMB data. We interpreted this as the presence of significant bulk velocities. In this paper we study the monopole, dipole and quadrupole in the Pantheon+SH0ES data. We find that in addition to the dipole also both, the monopole and the quadrupole are detected with high significance. They are of similar amplitudes as the bulk flow. While the monopole is only significant at very low redshift, the quadrupole even increases with redshift.

2024-03-26, **Cosmic-ray Acceleration in Core-Collapse Supernova Remnants with the Wind Termination Shock**, Shoma F. Kamijima et.al., [2403.17335v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17335v1)

 We investigate the attainable maximum energy of particles accelerated in the core-collapse supernova remnant (SNR) shock propagating in the free wind region with the Parker-spiral magnetic field, current sheet, and the wind termination shock (WTS) by using test particle simulations. This work focuses on Wolf-Rayet stars as progenitors. The magnetic field amplification in the free wind region (shock upstream region) is not considered in this work. Test particle simulations show that particles escaped from the core-collapse SNR reach and move along the WTS, and eventually return to the SNR shock from the poles or equator of the WTS. The particle attainable energy can be boosted by this cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS and can be larger than the particle energy that is limited by escape from the SNR shock. The particle energy limited by the cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS is about $10-100~{\rm TeV}$. Thus, the core-collapse SNR without upstream magnetic field amplification can be the origin of the break around $10~{\rm TeV}$ of the energy spectrum of observed cosmic ray protons and helium.
