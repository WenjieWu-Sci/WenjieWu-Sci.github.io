2025-05-15, **First Results on the Search for Lepton Number Violating Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay with the LEGEND-200 Experiment**, H. Acharya et.al., [2505.10440v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10440v1)

 The LEGEND collaboration is searching for neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay by operating high-purity germanium detectors enriched in $^{76}$Ge in a low-background liquid argon environment. Building on key technological innovations from GERDA and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, LEGEND-200 has performed a first $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay search based on 61 kg yr of data. Over half of this exposure comes from our highest performing detectors, including newly developed inverted-coaxial detectors, and is characterized by an estimated background level of $0.5^{+0.3}\_{-0.2}$ cts/(keV kg yr) in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay signal region. A combined analysis of data from GERDA, the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, and LEGEND-200, characterized by a 90% confidence level exclusion sensitivity of $2.8 \times 10^{26}$ yr on the half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, reveals no evidence for a signal and sets a new observed lower limit at $T^{0\nu}\_{1/2} > 1.9 \times 10^{26}$ yr (90% confidence level). Assuming the decay is mediated by Majorana neutrinos, this corresponds to an upper limit on the effective Majorana mass in the range $m\_{\beta\beta} < 70-200$ meV, depending on the adopted nuclear matrix element.

2025-05-15, **Quest for a phenomenologically consistent low cutoff theory**, Sudhakantha Girmohanta et.al., [2505.10233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10233v1)

 The Randall-Sundrum model with the Higgs localized on the IR brane solves the gauge hierarchy problem. However, the associated low cutoff ($\Lambda \sim 10$ TeV) generically leads to unacceptably rapid nucleon decay and excessively large Majorana neutrino masses. Achieving consistency while simultaneously explaining the Yukawa hierarchy requires either a horizontal symmetry or a discrete gauged symmetry. We demonstrate that eliminating all dangerous operators within a horizontal symmetry framework must come with large and unattractive charge assignments, if possible at all. Hence, we consider an exact discrete gauged $\mathbf{Z}\_N$ symmetry, with fermion mass hierarchies generated via wavefunction overlap. We employ this to reproduce the current CKM and PMNS structures. Under minimal assumptions, it predicts Dirac neutrinos with a total mass $\sim 66$ meV. Since the $\mathbf{Z}\_N$ charges must be generation-blind, flavor observables serve as key probes.

2025-05-14, **Neutrino-less double beta decay in the $ν$ Standard Model**, Vincenzo Cirigliano et.al., [2505.09679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09679v1)

 We perform a comprehensive study of the $3+3$ Type-I seesaw model for a broad range of right-handed mass scales (from keV to 10 TeV). We take into account and, in some cases, update the constraints from a large number of high- and low-energy experiments and study the implications on neutrino-less double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. We illustrate our findings through profile likelihood plots for the half-life $T\_{1/2}^{0\nu}$ and two-dimensional plots correlating $T\_{1/2}^{0\nu}$ to neutrino masses. We find that in this simple class of models for Majorana neutrino masses, current and next-generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments have a broad discovery potential in both the normal and inverted orderings of the spectrum of light active neutrinos.

2025-05-14, **Illuminating Very Heavy Dark Matter in the Earth with Tau Neutrinos**, Tianyi Ding et.al., [2505.09673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09673v1)

 Dark matter accumulates in the center of the Earth as the planet plows through the dark matter halo in the Milky Way. Possible annihilation of dark matter to Standard Model particles can be probed in indirect dark matter searches. Among possible messengers, neutrinos are uniquely ideal as they can escape dense regions. Therefore, neutrino telescopes, with their large volume and broad energy exposures, offer new opportunities to search for dark matter signals from the center of the Earth. However, such studies have been restricted to dark matter masses below $\sim$ PeV as the Earth becomes opaque to very-high-energy neutrinos. In this study, we demonstrate that neutrino telescopes operating at TeV-PeV energies can probe very heavy dark matter particles if they annihilate to tau neutrinos or tau leptons. Here, we report upper limits on the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon cross section for masses between $10^5$ GeV and $10^{10}$ GeV by using 7.5 years of IceCube high-energy starting event observations. Our results motivate detailed analyses in IceCube and other upcoming neutrino telescopes in the Northern Hemisphere.

2025-05-14, **DESI DR1 Lyα 1D power spectrum: The Fast Fourier Transform estimator measurement**, Corentin Ravoux et.al., [2505.09493v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09493v1)

 We present the one-dimensional Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum measurement derived from the data release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The measurement of the Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum along the line of sight from high-redshift quasar spectra provides information on the shape of the linear matter power spectrum, neutrino masses, and the properties of dark matter. In this work, we use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based estimator, which is validated on synthetic data in a companion paper. Compared to the FFT measurement performed on the DESI early data release, we improve the noise characterization with a cross-exposure estimator and test the robustness of our measurement using various data splits. We also refine the estimation of the uncertainties and now present an estimator for the covariance matrix of the measurement. Furthermore, we compare our results to previous high-resolution and eBOSS measurements. In another companion paper, we present the same DR1 measurement using the Quadratic Maximum Likelihood Estimator (QMLE). These two measurements are consistent with each other and constitute the most precise one-dimensional power spectrum measurement to date, while being in good agreement with results from the DESI early data release.

2025-05-14, **Late-time suppression of structure growth as a solution for the $S_8$ tension**, Ryo Terasawa et.al., [2505.09176v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09176v1)

 The $S\_8$ value inferred from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Year 3 cosmic shear data, under the assumption of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, is 2-3$\sigma$ lower than that inferred from observations of the early-time universe, such as cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data. Resolving the $S\_8$ tension requires a scenario in which structure formation on small scales is suppressed in the late universe. As potential solutions, we consider extended models both within and beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model -- models that incorporate parameterized baryonic feedback effects, the effect of varying neutrino mass, and modified structure growth, each of which can lead to a suppression of structure growth at lower redshifts, with its own distinct scale- and redshift-dependencies. In particular, we consider phenomenological modified gravity models in which the suppression of structure growth is triggered at lower redshifts, as dark energy ($\Lambda$) begins to dominate the background expansion. We show that the modified growth factor models -- especially those featuring more rapid growth suppression at lower redshifts -- provide an improved fit to the combined datasets of the HSC-Y3 cosmic shear correlation functions, the Planck CMB, and the ACT DR6 CMB lensing, compared to the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model and the models including the baryonic effects or the massive neutrino effect within the the $\Lambda$CDM framework.

2025-05-14, **Neutrino Fluence influenced by Memory Burdened Primordial Black Holes**, Arnab Chaudhuri et.al., [2505.09153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09153v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs), formed in the early Universe, are capable of emitting both Standard Model (SM) and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) particles via Hawking radiation. We investigate the impact of the recently proposed memory burden effect which is a quantum gravitational backreaction that suppresses black hole evaporation once approximately half the PBH mass is lost on the production of high energy neutrinos. In particular, we examine how this suppression modifies the time-integrated muon neutrino flux, with and without the inclusion of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) as BSM states. We compute the resulting neutrino fluence for different suppression strengths and analyze the prospects for detection in neutrino telescopes such as IceCube. Our results show that the memory burden significantly alters the neutrino energy spectrum, particularly at high energies, and that the presence of HNLs can counterbalance this suppression by introducing additional neutrino production channels. These findings have important implications for the detectability of PBH evaporation signatures and the parameter space of HNLs in cosmological settings.

2025-05-14, **Measuring the Cosmic Ray Spectrum with Next Generation Neutrino Detectors**, Stephan A. Meighen-Berger et.al., [2505.09111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09111v1)

 We investigate the capabilities of upcoming kiloton-scale neutrino detectors, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, in determining the primary cosmic ray spectrum. These detectors provide full-sky coverage and long-term monitoring, unlike traditional satellite and balloon experiments that measure cosmic ray flux at specific altitudes and locations. By analyzing the atmospheric neutrino flux generated by cosmic ray interactions, we demonstrate that future detectors can differentiate between various cosmic ray models with high statistical significance, even when accounting for uncertainties in neutrino cross sections and hadronic interactions. We introduce a technique for reconstructing the primary cosmic ray spectrum using neutrino measurements, which reduces the flux uncertainty from approximately 20\% to about 7\%. We then show that Hyper-K has the potential to increase sensitivity to neutrino oscillation parameters, such as $\sin^2\theta\_{23}$, by a factor of 2. Our results highlight the complementary role of neutrino detectors in cosmic ray physics and their critical importance for precision measurements in particle astrophysics.

2025-05-14, **Effects of virtual Majorana neutrinos on charged Lepton Flavor Violation decays from a seesaw variant with radiatively induced light neutrino masses**, Enrique Ramírez et.al., [2505.09051v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09051v1)

 Lepton flavor violating decays $\ell\_{\alpha} \to \ell\_{\beta} \gamma$, being forbidden in the Standard Model framework, provide a sensitive probe for new physics. We study these processes in a seesaw variant in which small neutrino masses are generated radiatively. By analyzing the parameter space constrained by electroweak precision data, we investigate the correlation between these decays and non-unitary effects from TeV-scale heavy neutrinos. According to our results, $\mu \to e \gamma$ is the most promising channel for new physics searches, with the bound $\|\eta\_{\mu e}\| \lesssim 10^{-6}$ obtained for non-unitary effects in this radiative seesaw variant. Our estimations of $\mathcal{BR} \left( \mu \to e \gamma \right)$, which depends on the mass of the heavy neutrinos, shows that both current and future experimental facilities might be sensitive to these effects.

2025-05-15, **Constraints on dark matter self-interaction from velocity distribution function in isolated halos**, Tirtha Sankar Ray et.al., [2505.10451v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10451v1)

 Self-interactions facilitate inter-particle redistribution of energy within the dense regions of galactic halos, implying modifications in the density and velocity distribution of dark matter. Simulating dark-matter only isolated halos for a wide range of mass and specific self-scattering cross-sections, we make a systematic study of the impact of self-scattering on the velocity distribution profiles. We report a conservative bound on $\sigma/m$ $\leq 2.7 \rm cm^2/gm$ at $95\%$ C.L. from observations of rotation curves in Milky-Way size galaxies. Sub-leading bounds from LSB galaxy and clusters are also presented.

2025-05-15, **Photomultiplier Requirements and Pre-Calibration for the SABRE South Liquid Scintillator Veto**, L. J. Milligan et.al., [2505.10353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10353v1)

 We present a study of the oil-proof base Hamamatsu R5912 photomultiplier tubes that will be used in the SABRE South linear-alkylbenzene liquid scintillator veto. SABRE South is a dark matter direct detection experiment at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory, aiming to test the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter annual modulation signal. We discuss the requirements of the liquid scintillator system and its photomultipliers, outline the methods and analysis used for the characterisation measurements, and results from initial tests. We discuss the impact of these measurements on the performance of the active veto system and explore analysis methods to allow for low threshold operation. Finally, we include results from a small scale liquid scintillator detector prototype used to assess the future performance of pulse shape discrimination in the liquid scintillator veto, and how well accommodated it is by the R5912 PMTs.

2025-05-15, **Resonant DM scattering in the galactic center under the influence of EMRI**, Takafumi Kakehi et.al., [2505.10036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10036v1)

 Dark matter (DM) search is one of the greatest challenges in physics. If DM consists of particles, it may form a spike around supermassive black holes (BH) prevalent in galaxy centers. This spike could be potentially observed by altering the orbits of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs), one of LISA's main targets. Meanwhile, the effects of EMRI on the DM spike have also been explored. In this study, we focus on the tidal resonances between DM particles and EMRI secondary. As the EMRI orbit evolves via gravitational wave backreaction, each DM particle experiences a significant number of resonances. Although the effect of each individual resonance is small, their cumulative impact might significantly alter the DM particle's orbit. To examine this possibility, we explicitly derive the interaction Hamiltonian for tidal resonances and conducted numerical calculations.

2025-05-15, **Constraining Fermionic Dark Matter with Galactic Neutron Stars**, Jianyuan Luo et.al., [2505.10026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10026v1)

 Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most significant open questions in modern physics, with its nature and interactions largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the behavior of massive fermionic DM particles in the context of neutron stars (NSs), extending prior studies which focused on the bosonic DM. By incorporating the motion of NSs in the Galaxy and considering scenarios with and without DM self-annihilation, we demonstrate their impact on the DM capture rate and the accumulation process inside NSs. Observational data from pulsars in the Milky Way are used to place constraints on DM properties, including the mass and the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section, offering a more comprehensive picture in probing DM interactions in astrophysical environments.

2025-05-15, **Multi-component Dark Matter from an $SU(2)_{D}\to Z_{3}^{D}\times Z_{2}^{\text{acc}}$ scenario**, Carlos Alvarado et.al., [2505.10025v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10025v1)

 A multi-component weakly-interacting dark matter scenario is analyzed, where the candidate dark matter states arise from the $SU(2)\_{D}\to Z\_{3}^{D}\times Z\_{2}^{\text{acc}}$ symmetry breaking triggered by a VEV-developing scalar in the $J=3/2$ representation. While the discrete symmetries guarantee at least two stable states, a closer look at the mass orderings of the contrived dark sector reveals the existence of a third dark matter candidate, whose stability effectively results from the tight phase space in the dark boson sector. Regions of masses and couplings where the three dark states furnish a comparable contribution to the observed relic abundance are determined numerically.

2025-05-15, **New cosmological constraints on the evolution of dark matter energy density**, Yupeng Yang et.al., [2505.09879v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09879v1)

 We constrain the evolution of dark matter energy density over time, specifically focusing on deviation from the standard model represented by the equation $\rho\_{m}\propto(1+z)^{3-\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon$ is a constant parameter. Utilizing a diverse array of observational datasets, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data from the first release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance priors derived from cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained through the cosmic chronometers (CC) method, type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Panthon sample, and the data from the redshift space distortion (RSD) measurements ($f\sigma\_8$), we derive stringent constraints on the deviation parameter. We find that for the model under consideration, the deviation parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon = -0.0073^{+0.0029}\_{-0.0033}$, indicating a deviation of approximately $2.4\sigma$ from the scenario where dark matter and vacuum dark energy do not interact. When compared with previous studies and alternative analyses, our findings provide corroborative evidence for an interaction between dark matter and vacuum dark energy, particularly in light of the release of BAO data from DESI.

2025-05-14, **Aspects of the WIMP quality problem and R-parity violation in natural supersymmetry with all axion dark matter**, Howard Baer et.al., [2505.09785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09785v1)

 In supersymmetric models where the mu problem is solved via discrete R-symmetries, then both the global U(1)\_{PQ} (Peccei-Quinn, needed to solve the strong CP problem) and R-parity conservation (RPC, needed for proton stability) are expected to arise as accidental, approximate symmetries. Then in some cases, SUSY dark matter is expected to be all axions since the relic lightest SUSY particles (LSPs) can decay away via small R-parity violating (RPV) couplings. We examine several aspects of this {\it all axion} SUSY dark matter scenario. 1. We catalogue the operator suppression which is gained from discrete R-symmetry breaking via four two-extra-field base models. 2. We present exact tree-level LSP decay rates including mixing and phase space effects and compare to results from simple, approximate formulae. 3. Natural SUSY models are characterized by light higgsinos with mass ~100-350 GeV so that the dominant sparticle production cross sections at LHC14 are expected to be higgsino pair production which occurs at the 10^2-10^4 fb level. Assuming nature is natural, the lack of an RPV signal from higgsino pair production in LHC data translates into rather strong upper bounds on nearly all trilinear RPV couplings in order to render the SUSY signal (nearly) invisible. Thus, in natural SUSY models with light higgsinos, the RPV-couplings must be small enough that the LSP has a rather high quality of RPC.

2025-05-14, **A fully relativistic treatment of EMRIs in collisionless environments**, Rodrigo Vicente et.al., [2505.09715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09715v1)

 Future mHz gravitational wave (GW) interferometers will precisely probe massive black hole environments, such as accretion discs, cold dark matter overdensities, and clouds of ultralight bosons, as long as we can accurately model the dephasing they induce on the waveform of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Most existing models rely on extrapolations from Newtonian results to model the interaction of the small black hole in an EMRI system with the environment surrounding the massive black hole. Here, we present a fully relativistic formalism to model such interaction with collisionless environments, focusing on the case of cold dark matter overdensities, like 'spikes' and 'mounds'. We implement our new formalism in the FastEMRIWaveforms framework and show that the resulting waveforms are significantly different from those based on a Newtonian treatment of environmental effects. Our results indicate that a fully relativistic treatment is essential to capture the environmental dephasing of GW signals from EMRIs accurately.

2025-05-14, **Search for a dark Higgs boson produced in association with inelastic dark matter at the Belle II experiment**, Belle II Collaboration et.al., [2505.09705v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09705v1)

 Inelastic dark matter models that have two dark matter particles and a massive dark photon can reproduce the observed relic dark matter density without violating cosmological limits. The mass splitting between the two dark matter particles $\chi\_{1}$ and $\chi\_{2}$, with $m(\chi\_{2}) > m(\chi\_{1})$, is induced by a dark Higgs field and a corresponding dark Higgs boson $h^{\prime}$. We present a search for dark matter in events with two vertices, at least one of which must be displaced from the interaction region, and missing energy. Using a $365\,\mbox{fb}^{-1}$ data sample collected at Belle II, which operates at the SuperKEKB $e^+e^-$ collider, we observe no evidence for a signal. We set upper limits on the product of the production cross section $\sigma\left(e^+e^- \to h^\prime \chi\_1 \chi\_2\right)$, and the product of branching fractions $\mathcal{B}\left(\chi\_2\to\chi\_1 e^+ e^-\right)\times\mathcal{B}\left(h^\prime\to x^+x^-\right)$, where $x^+x^-$ indicates $\mu^+\mu^-, \pi^+\pi^-$, or $K^+K^-$, as functions of $h^{\prime}$ mass and lifetime at the level of $10^{-1}\,\mbox{fb}$. We set model-dependent upper limits on the dark Higgs mixing angle at the level of $10^{-5}$ and on the dark photon kinetic mixing parameter at the level of $10^{-3}$. This is the first search for dark Higgs bosons in association with inelastic dark matter.

2025-05-14, **Superradiant Bosons Driving Supermassive Black Hole Mergers**, Qianhang Ding et.al., [2505.09696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09696v1)

 Ultralight bosons (ULBs) can form macroscopic superradiant clouds around spinning black holes. We show that for scalar ULB masses $\mu \sim 10^{-22}-10^{-21}$ eV boson cloud dynamical friction drives supermassive black hole (SMBH) final-parsec evolution in $\lesssim 1$ Gyr and suppresses the nanohertz gravitational wave background with turnover. Considering century-monitored OJ287 system, we place novel bounds restricting ULB mass range $\mu \simeq (8.5-22) \times 10^{-22}$ eV independent of any dark matter assumptions and show ULB drag can also efficiently reconcile any future confirmations of the debated orbital decay excess. Forthcoming pulsar timing array data and precise SMBH orbital timings will decisively test this scenario.

2025-05-14, **Growth of black holes at the centre of early-type galaxies in MOND**, Robin Eappen et.al., [2505.09690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09690v1)

 The formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in early-type galaxies (ETGs) is a key challenge for galaxy formation theories. Using the monolithic collapse models of ETGs formed in Milgromian Dynamics (MOND) from Eappen et al. (2022), we investigate the conditions necessary to form SMBHs in MOND and test whether these systems adhere to observed SMBH-galaxy scaling relations. We analyse the evolution of the gravitational potential and gas inflow rates in the model relics with a total stellar mass ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 times 10^11 solar masses. The gravitational potential exhibits a rapid deepening during the initial galaxy formation phase, accompanied by high gas inflow rates. These conditions suggest efficient central gas accumulation capable of fueling SMBH formation. We further examine the MBH - sigma relation by assuming that a fraction of the central stellar mass contributes to black hole formation. Black hole masses derived from 10 to 100 percent of the central mass are comparable with the observed relation, particularly at higher central velocity dispersions (sigma greater than 200 km/s). This highlights the necessity of substantial inner mass collapse to produce SMBHs consistent with observations. Our results demonstrate that MOND dynamics, through the rapid evolution of the gravitational potential and sustained gas inflows, provide a favorable environment for SMBH formation in ETGs. These findings support the hypothesis that MOND can naturally account for the observed SMBH-galaxy scaling relations without invoking cold dark matter, emphasizing the importance of early gas dynamics in determining final SMBH properties.

2025-05-14, **When Dark Matter Heats Up: A Model-Independent Search for Non-Cold Behavior**, Mazaharul Abedin et.al., [2505.09470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09470v1)

 This article questions the common assumption of cold dark matter (DM) by exploring the possibility of a non-zero equation of state (EoS) without relying on any parametric approach. In standard cosmological analyses, DM is typically modeled as pressureless dust with $w\_{\rm DM} = 0$, an assumption that aligns with large-scale structure formation, supports the empirical success of the $\Lambda$CDM model, and simplifies cosmological modeling. However, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a non-zero $w\_{\rm DM}$ from the cosmological framework. In this work, we explore this possibility through non-parametric and model-independent reconstructions based on Gaussian Process Regression. The reconstructions use Hubble parameter measurements from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR1 and DR2. Our findings suggest that a dynamical EoS for DM, although statistically mild, cannot be conclusively ruled out. Notably, we observe a tendency toward a negative $w\_{\rm DM}$ at the present epoch, a result that is particularly intriguing and may have meaningful implications for modern cosmology.

2025-05-14, **The Dual Primordial Black Hole Formation Scenario**, Xinpeng Wang et.al., [2505.09337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09337v1)

 We report a novel mechanism where two families of primordial black holes (PBHs) may form at nearly the same comoving scales but at two different epochs. It is realized in two-stage inflation where a non-inflationary stage is sandwiched by the two inflationary stages. In this case, smaller PBHs form when the comoving scale of interest re-enters the horizon during the break period, and larger PBHs form when the scale re-enters the horizon after inflation. This mechanism may realize both reheating of the universe through the evaporation of ultralight PBHs formed during the break stage and the dark matter by those formed after inflation. We show that this scenario may give rise to a distinctive signature in the stochastic gravitational wave background that can be tested by the near-future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA and DECIGO. Our work thus provides a unified observational window into the physics of inflation, reheating, and dark matter.

2025-05-14, **The Shape and Mass of the Galactic Dark Matter Halo from the Axisymmetric Jeans Model**, Lan Zhang et.al., [2505.09243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09243v1)

 We explore the density profile, shape, and virial mass of the Milky Way's dark matter halo using K giants (KG) from LAMOST and SDSS/SEGUE, as well as blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars from SDSS. Incorporating Gaia DR3 proper motions, we first investigate the velocity ellipsoid distribution within the $(R, \|z\|)$ space. The ellipsoids projected onto the $(v\_R, v\_z)$ plane exhibit near-spherical alignment. We then probe the underlying dark matter distribution using the axisymmetric Jeans equations with multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) and the spherically aligned Jeans anisotropic modelling (JAM${\rm sph}$), allowing for different flattened dark matter density models. For each model, we apply two fitting approaches: fitting the KGs and BHBs separately or fit them simultaneously as two dynamical tracers in one gravitational potential. We find consistent results on the dark matter density profiles, $r\_{200}$, and $M\_{200}$ within a 1-$\sigma$ confidence region for models constrained by KGs, BHBs, and both. We find the strongest consistency between KGs and BHBs in constraining dark matter profiles for models incorporating radially varying halo flattening ($q(r\_{\rm gc})$), which suggests the Milky Way's dark matter halo shape evolves with Galactocentric distance ($r\_{\rm gc}$). Specifically, the halo flattening parameter $q\_h$ decreases within $r\_{\rm gc} < 20$ kpc and increases for $r\_{\rm gc} > 20$ kpc. In this model, $M\_{\rm tot} (< 60~{\rm kpc}) = 0.533^{+0.061}\_{-0.054} \times 10^{12}$ $M\_{\odot}$, $r\_{200}$ is $188\pm15$ kpc, with $M\_{200}$ estimated at $0.820^{+0.210}\_{-0.186} \times 10^{12} M\_{\odot}$.

2025-05-14, **Probing Self-Interacting Dark Matter via Gravitational-Wave Background from Eccentric Supermassive Black Hole Mergers**, Mu-Chun Chen et.al., [2505.09219v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09219v1)

 The nature of dark matter is still mysterious despite various astronomical evidence. As a possible candidate, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can potentially resolve some issues appearing in cold dark matter paradigm. Here we investigate how SIDM around supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers may form a density spike and imprint in the spectrum shape of stochastic gravitational-wave background from SMBH binaries (SMBHBs). Employing a refined dynamical friction formula and consistently evolving the orbital dynamics, we demonstrate that current pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data is sensitive to the cross section of SIDM with $\sigma(v)/m\_\chi\lesssim0.66\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$, comparable to other astrophysical probes. We also highlight the importance of including the eccentricity of SMBHBs in the parameter inference, which would affect the results significantly. Our findings reveal the promising potential of PTAs observations in probing the nature of dark matter.

2025-05-14, **Neutron Decay Anomaly and Its Effects on Neutron Star Properties**, H. C. Das et.al., [2505.09190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09190v1)

 We investigate the effects of dark matter (DM) on neutron star (NS) properties using the neutron decay anomaly model within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) framework. Three nucleonic models (HCD0-HCD2) are developed, satisfying astrophysical constraints such as the maximum NS mass ($\geq 2 M\_\odot$), the NICER mass-radius limits, and the tidal deformability constraint from the GW170817 event. The equation of states of the NS admixed with DM (DMANS) are calculated by incorporating the self-interactions between them. The macroscopic properties, such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability of the NSs, are obtained for HCD models along with five others by varying self-interaction strength. By combining NS observations with scattering cross-section constraints from galaxy clusters, we explore model-dependent trends in the DM self-interaction parameter space. While the quantitative bounds may vary with hadronic model choice, our analysis offers insights into the interplay between DM interactions and NS observables within the RMF framework.

2025-05-15, **Genetic algorithm demystified for cosmological parameter estimation**, Reginald Christian Bernardo et.al., [2505.10450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10450v1)

 Genetic algorithm (GA) belongs to a class of nature-inspired evolutionary algorithms that leverage concepts from natural selection to perform optimization tasks. In cosmology, the standard method for estimating parameters is the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, renowned for its reliability in determining cosmological parameters. This paper presents a pedagogical examination of GA as a potential corroborative tool to MCMC for cosmological parameter estimation. Utilizing data sets from cosmic chronometers and supernovae with a curved $\Lambda$CDM model, we explore the impact of GA's key hyperparameters -- such as the fitness function, crossover rate, and mutation rate -- on the population of cosmological parameters determined by the evolutionary process. We compare the results obtained with GA to those by MCMC, analyzing their effectiveness and viability for cosmological application.

2025-05-15, **A hybrid SLAM-Payne framework for atmospheric parameter and abundance determination of early-type Stars from LAMOST DR9 low-resolution Spectra**, Weijia Sun et.al., [2505.10310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10310v1)

 Early-type stars are key drivers of Galactic chemical evolution, enriching the interstellar medium with alpha elements through powerful stellar winds and core-collapse supernovae, fueled by their short lifetimes and high masses. However, their spectra remain challenging to analyse due to rapid rotation, weak metal lines, and non-LTE effects. While large spectroscopic surveys provide extensive low-resolution data, extracting reliable parameters remains difficult due to methodological limitations for hot stars. Our goal is to develop a unified framework combining data-driven and synthetic spectral approaches to determine atmospheric parameters and abundances for hot stars using low-resolution spectra, addressing limitations in current methodologies while retaining critical spectral information. We present a hybrid approach integrating the Stellar LAbel Machine (SLAM) and the Payne frameworks, for low-resolution ($R\sim 1800$) spectra from LAMOST DR9. Our method preserves full spectral information including Balmer series and metal-line blends, employing neural-network interpolation for efficient parameter estimation ($T\_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$, and $v\sin i$) and abundance determination for O, Mg, Si, and Fe, across 8000 - 20000 K. We derive stellar parameters and abundances for 315,822 stars with $\mathrm{SNR} \geqslant 10$ in the $r$-band. Additionally, we detect abundance trends ([$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]) that exhibit temperature-dependent systematics and a distinct $\alpha$-poor stellar population within $0.0 \leqslant \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \leqslant 0.5$ dex. The radial abundance gradients are negative and consistent with that derived from Cepheids, with a slope of $-0.070\pm0.007$ in \feh in the region $6 \leqslant R\_\mathrm{GC}\leqslant 15$ kpc.

2025-05-15, **Enhanced Mass Loss of Very Massive Stars: Impact on the Evolution, Binary Processes, and Remnant Mass Spectrum**, Kendall G. Shepherd et.al., [2505.10206v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10206v1)

 Very massive stars (VMS) play a fundamental role in astrophysics due to their winds and supernovae (SN), and their role as massive black hole (BH) progenitors. However, their origin and evolution remain a significant challenge. Recent theoretical work and observations suggest that VMS approaching the Eddington limit may experience mass loss above the standard wind predictions. This study investigates how enhanced winds influence single and binary VMS evolution, observable properties, and resulting BH populations. New stellar wind prescriptions, sensitive to the Eddington parameter ($\Gamma\_e$) and the luminosity-to-mass ratio, were implemented into the stellar evolution code PARSEC v2.0. These updated single-star tracks (100 - 600 M$\_{\odot}$ at Z=0.006) were used to model the VMS population in the Tarantula Nebula and integrated into the SEVN binary evolution code. The $\Gamma\_e$-enhanced single-star tracks match observed VMS properties better than standard models. Explaining the most massive star, R136a1, through a single-star origin suggests a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass limit of $<$ 400 M$\_{\odot}$ regardless of the wind recipe used. However, binary stellar mergers also offer a suitable origin for R136a1 and other observed VMS, potentially lowering the upper ZAMS mass limit by ~100 M$\_{\odot}$. In binaries, enhanced winds inhibit main-sequence stellar mergers and limit BH production above the pair-instability mass gap's lower edge (~50 M$\_{\odot}$). Binary BHs merging in a Hubble time with enhanced winds yield more primary BHs above 30 M$\_{\odot}$ and enable secondary BHs between 30-40 solar masses, a range not found with standard stellar winds at LMC metallicity. This study highlights the crucial role that stellar winds and binary interactions play in VMS evolution and offers predictions relevant for interpreting VMS observations and gravitational wave source origins.

2025-05-15, **Probing the Dynamics of Gaussian Dark Energy Equation of State Using DESI BAO**, Saddam Hussain et.al., [2505.09913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09913v1)

 We present an updated reconstruction of the various dark energy equation of state (EoS), $w(a)$, employing the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data. This analysis constrains the cosmological scenarios influenced by these equations through the joint examination of a range of recently available cosmological probes, specifically the Pantheon+ sample and the DESY5 sample of Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Hubble parameter measurements derived from cosmic chronometers, and cosmic microwave background distance priors based on the Planck 2018 data. Furthermore, we provide a concise perspective on the dynamical evolution of all models and the interrelations among them. A Bayesian inference procedure is adopted to estimate the model parameters that yield the best fit to the data. The EoS remains within the phantom regime at higher redshifts, while favoring the quintessence regime in the current epoch. In this context, we propose a new Gaussian form EoS, termed BellDE, which avoids phantom behavior (\(w \geq -1\)) at higher redshifts while remaining precisely calibrated at lower redshifts. Interestingly, BellDE exhibits a transient phantom nature (\(w < -1\)) only around the transition redshift \(z \sim 0.5\), subsequently evolving into a quintessential regime (\(w > -1\)), as indicated by comparisons with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) and other parameterized EoS forms.

2025-05-15, **New cosmological constraints on the evolution of dark matter energy density**, Yupeng Yang et.al., [2505.09879v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09879v1)

 We constrain the evolution of dark matter energy density over time, specifically focusing on deviation from the standard model represented by the equation $\rho\_{m}\propto(1+z)^{3-\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon$ is a constant parameter. Utilizing a diverse array of observational datasets, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data from the first release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance priors derived from cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained through the cosmic chronometers (CC) method, type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Panthon sample, and the data from the redshift space distortion (RSD) measurements ($f\sigma\_8$), we derive stringent constraints on the deviation parameter. We find that for the model under consideration, the deviation parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon = -0.0073^{+0.0029}\_{-0.0033}$, indicating a deviation of approximately $2.4\sigma$ from the scenario where dark matter and vacuum dark energy do not interact. When compared with previous studies and alternative analyses, our findings provide corroborative evidence for an interaction between dark matter and vacuum dark energy, particularly in light of the release of BAO data from DESI.

2025-05-14, **Supernova in lost common envelope and SN 2006gy**, Nikolai Chugai et.al., [2505.09479v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09479v1)

 A mechanism is proposed for synchronizing core-collapse supernova with a recent loss of a red supergiant (RSG) envelope in the common envelope regime. A perequisite for the synchronization is a moderate RSG expansion during final decade. This scenario is based on the phenomenon of preSN~II dense shell formed at the final stage of 10-20 yr as a result of powerfull mass loss. The energy deposition into the RSG envelope that powers the enormous mass loss rate is able to expand the RSG. The moderate expansion is sufficient for the close secondary component to plunge into the common envelope with a subsequent explosion of stripped helium core. Superluminous SN~2006gy is suggested to be the outcome of this scenario.

2025-05-14, **When Dark Matter Heats Up: A Model-Independent Search for Non-Cold Behavior**, Mazaharul Abedin et.al., [2505.09470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09470v1)

 This article questions the common assumption of cold dark matter (DM) by exploring the possibility of a non-zero equation of state (EoS) without relying on any parametric approach. In standard cosmological analyses, DM is typically modeled as pressureless dust with $w\_{\rm DM} = 0$, an assumption that aligns with large-scale structure formation, supports the empirical success of the $\Lambda$CDM model, and simplifies cosmological modeling. However, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a non-zero $w\_{\rm DM}$ from the cosmological framework. In this work, we explore this possibility through non-parametric and model-independent reconstructions based on Gaussian Process Regression. The reconstructions use Hubble parameter measurements from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR1 and DR2. Our findings suggest that a dynamical EoS for DM, although statistically mild, cannot be conclusively ruled out. Notably, we observe a tendency toward a negative $w\_{\rm DM}$ at the present epoch, a result that is particularly intriguing and may have meaningful implications for modern cosmology.

2025-05-14, **The asymmetry of white dwarf double detonations and the observed scatter around the Phillips relation**, Alexander Holas et.al., [2505.09445v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09445v1)

 Recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) simulations featuring a double detonation scenario have managed to reproduce the overall trend of the Phillips relation reasonably well. However, most, if not all, multidimensional simulations struggle to reproduce the scatter of observed SNe around this relation, exceeding it substantially. In this study, we investigate whether the excessive scatter around the Phillips relation can be caused by an off-center ignition of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core in the double detonation scenario and if this can help constrain possible SN Ia explosion channels. We simulated the detonation of three different initial CO white dwarfs of $0.9$, $1.0$, and $1.1\,M\_\odot$, artificially ignited at systematically offset locations using the Arepo code. After nucleosynthetic postprocessing, we generated synthetic observables using the Artis code and compared these results against observational data and models of other works. We find that our simulations produce synthetic observables well within the range of the observed data in terms of viewing angle scatter. The majority of the viewing angle variability seems to be caused by line blanketing in the blue wavelengths of intermediate-mass elements and lighter iron-group elements, which are asymmetrically distributed in the outer layers of the ashes. Our results suggest that although the off-center ignition of the CO introduces substantial line of sight effects, it is not responsible for the excessive viewing angle scatter observed in other models. Instead, this effect seems to be caused by the detonation ashes from the rather massive helium (He) shells in current state-of-the-art models. Further reducing the He-shell masses of double detonation progenitors may be able to alleviate this issue and yield observables that reproduce the Phillips relation.

2025-05-14, **Generating Full-field Evolution of Physical Dynamics from Irregular Sparse Observations**, Panqi Chen et.al., [2505.09284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09284v1)

 Modeling and reconstructing multidimensional physical dynamics from sparse and off-grid observations presents a fundamental challenge in scientific research. Recently, diffusion-based generative modeling shows promising potential for physical simulation. However, current approaches typically operate on on-grid data with preset spatiotemporal resolution, but struggle with the sparsely observed and continuous nature of real-world physical dynamics. To fill the gaps, we present SDIFT, Sequential DIffusion in Functional Tucker space, a novel framework that generates full-field evolution of physical dynamics from irregular sparse observations. SDIFT leverages the functional Tucker model as the latent space representer with proven universal approximation property, and represents observations as latent functions and Tucker core sequences. We then construct a sequential diffusion model with temporally augmented UNet in the functional Tucker space, denoising noise drawn from a Gaussian process to generate the sequence of core tensors.   At the posterior sampling stage, we propose a Message-Passing Posterior Sampling mechanism, enabling conditional generation of the entire sequence guided by observations at limited time steps. We validate SDIFT on three physical systems spanning astronomical (supernova explosions, light-year scale), environmental (ocean sound speed fields, kilometer scale), and molecular (organic liquid, millimeter scale) domains, demonstrating significant improvements in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
