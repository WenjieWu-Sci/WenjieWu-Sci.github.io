2025-05-08, **Testing an unstable cosmic neutrino background**, Pasquale Di Bari et.al., [2505.05405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05405v1)

 I discuss how different cosmological observations can test the possibility that neutrinos might be unstable on cosmological times, resulting into an unstable cosmic neutrino background. I also discuss out how actually there are different independent anomalies intriguingly hint to such a possibility that would clearly point to new physics. I first focus on how the new DESI results place an upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses that starts to be in tension with the lower bound from neutrino oscillation experiments and how this tension could be easily solved assuming unstable relic neutrinos. Then I show how 21 cm cosmology allows to test radiative relic neutrino decays and how these could explain the controversial EDGES anomaly. I also discuss how the excess radio background and in particular the ARCADE 2 data can also be nicely explained by relic neutrino radiative decays. Finally, I point out the difficulties in building a model that does not clash with the upper limits on the effective magnetic moment coming from neutrino-electron scattering experiments and globular cluster stars.

2025-05-08, **Primordial black-hole formation and heavy r-process element synthesis from the cosmological QCD transition. Two aspects of an inhomogeneous early Universe**, M. Gonin et.al., [2505.05463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05463v1)

 We review the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) for illuminating the dark ages of the cosmological evolution and as dark matter candidates. We elucidate the role of phase transitions for primordial black hole formation in the early Universe and focus our attention to the cosmological QCD phase transition within a recent microscopical model. We explore the impact of physics beyond the Standard Model on the cosmic equation of state and the probability distribution for the formation of primordial black holes which serve as dark matter (DM) candidates. We argue that besides primordial black holes also droplet-like quark-gluon plasma inhomogeneities may become gravitationally stabilized for a sufficiently long epoch to distill baryon number and form nuclear matter droplets which upon their evaporation may enrich the cosmos locally with heavy $r$-process elements already in the early Universe.

2025-05-08, **Prospects for Probing Sub-GeV Leptophilic Dark Matter with the Future VLAST**, Tian-Peng Tang et.al., [2505.05359v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05359v1)

 The proposed Very Large Area Space Telescope (VLAST), with its expected unprecedented sensitivity in the MeV-GeV range, can also address the longstanding "MeV Gap" in gamma-ray observations. We explore the capability of VLAST to detect sub-GeV leptophilic dark matter (DM) annihilation, focusing on scalar and vector mediators and emphasizing the resonance region where the mediator mass is approximately twice the DM mass. While $s$-wave annihilation is tightly constrained by relic density and cosmic microwave background observations, $p$-wave and mixed $(s+p)$-wave scenarios remain viable, particularly near resonance. Additionally, direct detection experiments, especially those probing DM-electron scattering, significantly constrain nonresonance parameter space but are less effective in the resonance regime. VLAST can uniquely probe this surviving region, outperforming existing and planned instruments, and establishing itself as a crucial tool for indirect detection of thermal relic DM.

2025-05-08, **Search for dark matter produced in association with one or two top quarks in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV**, CMS Collaboration et.al., [2505.05300v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05300v1)

 A search is performed for dark matter (DM) produced in association with a single top quark or a pair of top quarks using the data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to 138 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. An excess of events with a large imbalance of transverse momentum is searched for across 0, 1 and 2 lepton final states. Novel multivariate techniques are used to take advantage of the differences in kinematic properties between the two DM production mechanisms. No significant deviations with respect to the standard model predictions are observed. The results are interpreted considering a simplified model in which the mediator is either a scalar or pseudoscalar particle and couples to top quarks and to DM fermions. Axion-like particles that are coupled to top quarks and DM fermions are also considered. Expected exclusion limits of 410 and 380 GeV for scalar and pseudoscalar mediator masses, respectively, are set at the 95% confidence level. A DM particle mass of 1 GeV is assumed, with mediator couplings to fermions and DM particles set to unity. A small signal-like excess is observed in data, with the largest local significance observed to be 1.9 standard deviations for the 150 GeV pseudoscalar mediator hypothesis. Because of this excess, mediator masses are only excluded below 310 (320) GeV for the scalar (pseudoscalar) mediator. The results are also translated into model-independent 95% confidence level upper limits on the visible cross section of DM production in association with top quarks, ranging from 1 pb to 0.02 pb.

2025-05-08, **Computing singlet scalar freeze-out with plasmon and plasmino states**, S. Biondini et.al., [2505.05206v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05206v1)

 The final-state particles from cosmological dark matter co-annihilation are expected to equilibrate. As dictated by Hard Thermal Loop resummation, the spectrum of equilibrated quasiparticles is richer than in vacuum, with a massless gauge field possessing three independent polarization states (``plasmons''), and a massless fermion developing a novel branch (``plasmino''). Furthermore, once the Higgs phenomenon sets in, vacuum and thermal mass corrections interfere. We collect together the corresponding poles and residues for the Standard Model around its crossover temperature. Choosing its singlet scalar extension for illustration, we subsequently demonstrate, both numerically and via power counting, and in accordance with general theoretical expectations, how in the freeze-out of TeV-scale dark matter, these effects remain well hidden in the inclusive annihilation cross section. In particular, the dominant (longitudinal) gauge channel is shown to be practically temperature-independent. Cosmological constraints on TeV-scale singlet scalars are reconfirmed.

2025-05-08, **Axion Dark Matter Search with Near-KSVZ Sensitivity Using the TM$_{020}$ Mode**, Sungjae Bae et.al., [2505.05095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05095v1)

 Dark matter remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern physics, with axions, a hypothetical particle proposed to resolve the strong CP problem, standing as a compelling candidate. Among various experimental strategies, cavity haloscopes currently offer the most sensitive method to detect axions, though their searches have largely been confined to axion masses below 10 $\mu$eV. However, recent theoretical developments suggest that the axion mass lies beyond this range. Higher-order cavity modes have been explored as a methodological approach to expand the search range, albeit with limited success in achieving both high sensitivity and broad tunability. In this work, we present a sensitive search for axions with masses around 21 $\mu$eV, utilizing the TM$\_{020}$ mode of a cylindrical cavity, which incorporated an innovative tuning mechanism. Our results reached 1.7 times the KSVZ sensitivity over 100 MHz, representing a significant improvement in this mass range and contributing to the experimental search for axion dark matter at higher masses.

2025-05-08, **Study of Wormholes in Symmetric Teleparallel Theories of Gravity**, Moreshwar Tayde et.al., [2505.04952v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04952v1)

 This thesis explores traversable wormhole (WH) solutions within symmetric teleparallel gravity and its extensions, including $f(Q)$ and $f(Q, T)$ gravity. Chapter I reviews WH geometry and properties, general relativity, and modified gravity's role in WH physics. Chapter II constructs WHs in $f(Q)$ gravity using dark matter profiles like Pseudo-Isothermal and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW). For linear $f(Q)$ models, suitable redshift and shape functions satisfying the flare-out condition yield viable WHs, with the monopole charge $\eta$ driving Null Energy Condition (NEC) violation. The Volume Integral Quantifier (VIQ) method shows minimal exotic matter is needed. Nonlinear models like $f(Q) = Q + m Q^n$ fail to meet WH criteria. Chapter III studies $f(Q, T)$ gravity, where $Q$ and the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor are coupled. WHs are examined under barotropic and anisotropic equations of state using forms like $f(Q, T) = \alpha Q + \beta T$ and $f(Q, T) = Q + \lambda\_1 Q^2 + \eta\_1 T$. NEC violations occur near the throat, indicating effective matter-geometry coupling. Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) analysis confirms equilibrium under suitable parameters. Chapter IV employs the MIT bag model in $f(Q, T)$ gravity, treating it as a source of exotic matter. Specific shape functions lead to WHs with NEC violation and TOV-based stability under radial perturbations. Chapter V considers WHs in $f(Q, T)$ gravity with noncommutative geometries inspired by string theory. Gaussian and Lorentzian smeared sources are used. Linear models yield analytical WH solutions, nonlinear ones are numerical. All satisfy the flare-out condition and exhibit NEC violation. Gravitational lensing analysis reveals distinguishable features from black holes. Chapter VI summarizes the results, emphasizing observational prospects in extended gravity frameworks.
