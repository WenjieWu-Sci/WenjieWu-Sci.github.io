2024-07-24, **The HalfDome Multi-Survey Cosmological Simulations: N-body Simulations**, Adrian E. Bayer et.al., [2407.17462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17462v1)

 Upcoming cosmological surveys have the potential to reach groundbreaking discoveries on multiple fronts, including the neutrino mass, dark energy, and inflation. Most of the key science goals require the joint analysis of datasets from multiple surveys to break parameter degeneracies and calibrate systematics. To realize such analyses, a large set of mock simulations that realistically model correlated observables is required. In this paper we present the N-body component of the HalfDome cosmological simulations, designed for the joint analysis of Stage-IV cosmological surveys, such as Rubin LSST, Euclid, SPHEREx, Roman, DESI, PFS, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and LiteBIRD. Our 300TB initial data release includes full-sky lightcones and halo catalogs between $z$=0--4 for 11 fixed cosmology realizations, as well as an additional run with local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f\_{\rm NL}$=20). The simulations evolve $6144^3$ particles in a 3.75$\,h^{-1} {\rm Gpc}$ box, reaching a minimum halo mass of $\sim 6 \times 10^{12}\,h^{-1} M\_\odot$ and maximum scale of $k \sim 1\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Instructions to access the data, and plans for future data releases, can be found at https://halfdomesims.github.io.

2024-07-24, **Exploring new physics with DUNE high energy flux: the case of Lorentz Invariance Violation, Large Extra Dimensions and Long Range Forces**, Alessio Giarnetti et.al., [2407.17247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17247v1)

 DUNE is a next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. It is expected to measure with an unprecedent precision the atmospheric oscillation parameters, including the CP-violating phase $\delta\_{CP}$. Moreover, several studies have suggested that its unique features should allow DUNE to probe several new physics scenarios. In this work, we explore the performances of the DUNE far detector in constraining new physics if a high-energy neutrino flux is employed (HE-DUNE). We take into account three different scenarios: Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV), Long Range Forces (LRF) and Large Extra Dimensions (LED). Our results show that HE-DUNE should be able to set bounds competitive to the current ones and, in particular, it can outperform the standard DUNE capabilities in constraining CPT-even LIV parameters and the compactification radius $R\_{ED}$ of the LED model.

2024-07-24, **The case for adopting the sequential Jacobi's diagonalization algorithm in neutrino oscillation physics**, Gustavo A. Valdiviesso et.al., [2407.17188v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17188v1)

 Neutrino flavor oscillations and conversion in the presence of an interacting background may offer the missing evidence for charge-parity violation in the leptonic sector of the Standard Model, as well as yet undiscovered new interactions. The usual approach for simulating these effects is by numerically integrating the Schrodinger equation over the neutrino trajectory, arriving at the conversion and survival probabilities for each flavor. From these, the neutrino mixing matrix and its parameters are recovered. This work makes the case for a different numerical approach, which starts by recognizing how Jacobi's diagonalization algorithm is the most suitable for neutrino oscillations in general. By switching from physical space to a parameter space of choice, Jacobi's algorithm results in both eigenvalues and eigenvectors simultaneously, with only local round-off errors. This approach is trivially parallelizable, making it a suitable choice for concurrent computation. Moreover, the freedom to build a parameter space allows for quasi-model-independent solutions, which in turn eliminates the necessity of repeating the simulation for every change in the model's parameters. Benchmarks and efficiency analyses are discussed, as well as a concrete neutrino oscillation example.

2024-07-23, **Yukawa contributions to the $ν$SMEFT Renormalization Group Evolution**, Marco Ardu et.al., [2407.16751v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16751v1)

 In this work we consider the Standard Model Effective Field Theory extended with right-handed neutrinos, the $\nu$SMEFT, and calculate the one-loop anomalous dimensions that are proportional to Yukawa couplings. These contributions are particularly relevant when symmetry-protected low scale seesaw models are embeded in the SMEFT, since large neutrino Yukawa couplings are expected. By combining our results with the already available gauge anomalous dimensions, we provide the complete set of one-loop renormalization group evolution equations for the dimension six $\nu$SMEFT. As a possible phenomenological implication of our results, we discuss the sensitivity of lepton flavor-violating observables to $\nu$SMEFT operators, focusing on the more sensitive $\mu\to e$ transitions.

2024-07-23, **Leptogenesis via Bubble Collisions**, Martina Cataldi et.al., [2407.16747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16747v1)

 We present a novel realization of leptogenesis from the decays of sterile (right-handed) neutrinos (RHNs) produced from runaway bubble collisions at a first order phase transition. Such configurations can produce heavy RHNs with mass many orders of magnitude above the scale of symmetry breaking as well as the temperature of the plasma, thereby enabling high scale leptogenesis without the need for high reheat temperatures while also naturally suppressing washout effects. This mechanism also extends the window of viability to RHN masses $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the natural scale for type-I seesaw with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ couplings, where standard thermal leptogenesis cannot produce the observed baryon asymmetry. The corresponding phase transitions are at scales $\gtrsim\!10^9$ GeV and produce gravitational wave signals that could be detected by future experiments.

2024-07-23, **Quantum coherence in neutrino spin-flavor oscillations**, Ashutosh Kumar Alok et.al., [2407.16742v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16742v1)

 Coherence, which represents the superposition of orthogonal states, is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and can also be precisely defined within quantum resource theory. Thus exploring quantum coherence in neutrino oscillations can not only help in examining the intrinsic quantum nature but can also explore their potential applications in quantum information technologies. Previous studies on quantum coherence have focused on neutrino flavor oscillations (FO). However, FO imply that neutrinos have mass and this can lead to the generation of a tiny but finite magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos through quantum loop diagrams at higher orders of perturbative expansion of the interaction. This electromagnetic property of neutrinos can induce spin flavor oscillations (SFO) in the presence of an external magnetic field and hence is expected to enrich the study of coherence. In this work, we investigate quantum coherence in neutrino SFO with three flavor mixing within the interstellar as well as intergalactic magnetic fields, quantified by the $l\_1$ norm and the relative entropy of coherence, and express these measures in terms of neutrino SFO probabilities. For FO, coherence measures can sustain higher values (say, within 50% of the maximum) over distances of several kilometers, which are relevant for terrestrial experiments like reactor and accelerator neutrinos. However, for SFO, we find that the coherence scale can extend to astrophysical distances, spanning from kiloparsecs to gigaparsecs.

2024-07-23, **Analytical Emulator for the Linear Matter Power Spectrum from Physics-Informed Machine Learning**, J. Bayron Orjuela-Quintana et.al., [2407.16640v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16640v1)

 Current and future large-scale structure surveys aim to constrain cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision by analyzing vast amounts of data. This imposes a pressing need to develop fast and accurate methods for computing the matter power spectrum $P(k)$, or equivalently, the matter transfer function $T(k)$. In previous works, we introduced precise fitting formulas for these quantities within the standard cosmological model, including extensions such as the presence of massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity. However, these formulations overlooked a key characteristic imprinted in $P(k)$: the baryon acoustic oscillation signal. Here, we leverage our understanding of the well-known physics behind this oscillatory pattern to impose constraints on our genetic algorithm, a machine learning technique. By employing this ``physics-informed'' approach, we introduce an expression that accurately describes the matter transfer function with sub-percent mean accuracy. The high interpretability of the output allows for straightforward extensions of this formulation to other scenarios involving massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity. We anticipate that this formula will serve as a competitive fitting function for $P(k)$, meeting the accuracy requirements essential for cosmological analyses.

2024-07-23, **Recent IceCube Results: Diffuse Flux, Point Sources and Dark Matter**, Minjin Jeong et.al., [2407.16371v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16371v1)

 In 2013, the IceCube Collaboration reported the first observation of an astrophysical neutrino flux, with energies extending up to the PeV-scale. Over the last decade, this flux has been characterized by measurements in multiple detection channels that are complementary with respect to the sensitive energy range, flavor composition, sky coverage, and backgrounds. The origin of these neutrinos remains largely unknown. However, evidence has been found for neutrino emission from the directions of the blazar TXS 0506+056, Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. and the Galactic Plane. IceCube also has an active program of indirect dark matter searches with competitive constraints on dark matter models. In this talk, we will present recent results of the IceCube experiment, highlighting the latest diffuse flux measurements, point source searches, and dark matter analyses.

2024-07-23, **Single photon performance characterisation of a Generation I Large Area Picosecond PhotoDetector**, Robert Foster et.al., [2407.16335v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16335v1)

 The single photoelectron performance characteristics of a Large Area Picosecond PhotoDetector (LAPPD) were studied using a picosecond optical laser source. We verify that the LAPPD is capable of achieving transit time spreads of less than 70 ps and spatial resolutions on the order of millimetres when illuminated with single photons. Isolation of the single photoelectron peak is easily possible in the pulse height distribution and the mean single photoelectron gain is measured to be greater than $10^{6}$ with gains above $10^{7}$ possible in certain voltage configurations. We judge the performance of the LAPPD sufficient for application in large-scale water or scintillator-based neutrino experiments, with additional work required to develop the digital signal processing algorithms necessary for processing photon hits in high photon occupancy environments.

2024-07-23, **First Direct Search for Light Dark Matter Using the NEON Experiment at a Nuclear Reactor**, J. J. Choi et.al., [2407.16194v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16194v1)

 We report new results from the Neutrino Elastic Scattering Observation with NaI (NEON) experiment in the search for light dark matter (LDM) using 2,636 kg$\cdot$days of NaI(Tl) exposure. The experiment employs an array of NaI(Tl) crystals with a total mass of 16.7 kg, located 23.7 meters away from a 2.8 GW thermal power nuclear reactor. We investigated LDM produced by the $\textit{invisible decay}$ of dark photons generated by high-flux photons during reactor operation. The energy spectra collected during reactor-on and reactor-off periods were compared within the LDM signal region of $1-10$ keV. No signal consistent with LDM interaction with electrons was observed, allowing us to set 90% confidence level exclusion limits for the dark matter-electron scattering cross-section ($\sigma\_e$) across dark matter masses ranging from 1 keV/c$^2$ to 1 MeV/c$^2$. Our results set a 90% confidence level upper limit of $\sigma\_e = 3.17\times10^{-35}~\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a dark matter mass of 100 keV/c$^2$, marking the best laboratory result in this mass range. Additionally, our search extends the coverage of LDM below 100 keV/c$^2$ first time.

2024-07-24, **Vector Dark Matter Halo: From Polarization Dynamics to Direct Detection**, Jiajun Chen et.al., [2407.17315v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17315v1)

 This study investigates the characteristic polarization formation and evolution of vector dark matter (VDM) in the outer halo of galaxies. By employing numerical simulations, we analyze the behavior of VDM under different initial conditions -- homogeneous, isotropic, and partially polarized. The simulations solve the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, examining the spin density distribution and its evolution during gravitational collapse and halo formation. Our results reveal that VDM forms halos and central Proca stars from homogeneous and isotropic conditions, with the polarization density fluctuation amplitude mirroring VDM matter density. In scenarios with no initial polarization, spin density remains stable in the halo core but fluctuates in outer regions. Partially polarized initial conditions lead to a conservation of total polarization, with increased core polarization resulting in opposite polarization in the periphery. We examine the novel consequences of the partially polarized state for direct detection of dark photons, i.e., VDM kinetically mixed with ordinary photons.

2024-07-24, **Fuzzy Dark Matter Constraints from the Hubble Frontier Fields**, Jackson Sipple et.al., [2407.17059v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17059v1)

 In fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies, the dark matter consists of ultralight bosons ($m\lesssim10^{-20}$ eV). The astrophysically large de Broglie wavelengths of such particles hinder the formation of low-mass dark matter halos. This implies a testable prediction: a corresponding suppression in the faint-end of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies. Notably, recent estimates of the faint-end UVLF at $z\sim5-9$ in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, probe up to five magnitudes fainter than typical ("blank-field") regions. These measurements thus far disfavor prominent turnovers in the UVLF at low luminosity, implying bounds on FDM. We fit a semi-empirical model to these and blank-field UVLF data, including the FDM particle mass as a free parameter. This fit excludes cases where the dark matter is entirely a boson of mass $m<1.5\times10^{-21}$ eV (with $2\sigma$ confidence). We also present a less stringent bound deriving solely from the requirement that the total observed abundance of galaxies, integrated over all luminosities, must not exceed the total halo abundance in FDM. This more model-agnostic bound disfavors $m<5\times10^{-22}$ eV ($2\sigma$). We forecast that future UVLF measurements from JWST lensing fields may probe masses several times larger than these bounds, although we demonstrate this is subject to theoretical uncertainties in modeling the FDM halo mass function.

2024-07-23, **A Relativistic Scalar Model for Fractional Interaction between Dark Matter and Gravity**, Francesco Benetti et.al., [2407.16787v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16787v1)

 In a series of recent papers we put forward a ``fractional gravity'' framework striking an intermediate course between a modified gravity theory and an exotic dark matter (DM) scenario, which envisages the DM component in virialized halos to feel a non-local interaction mediated by gravity. The remarkable success of this model in reproducing several aspects of DM phenomenology motivates us to look for a general relativistic extension. Specifically, we propose a theory, dubbed Relativistic Scalar Fractional Gravity or RSFG, in which the trace of the DM stress-energy tensor couples to the scalar curvature via a non-local operator constructed with a fractional power of the d'Alembertian. We derive the field equations starting from an action principle, and then we investigate their weak field limit, demonstrating that in the Newtonian approximation the fractional gravity setup of our previous works is recovered. We compute the first-order post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ and its relation with weak lensing, showing that although in RSFG the former deviates from its GR values of unity, the latter is unaffected. We also perform a standard scalar-vector-tensor-decomposition of RSFG in the weak field limit, to highlight that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light, though also an additional scalar mode becomes dynamical. Finally, we derive the modified conservation laws of the DM stress energy tensor in RSFG, showing that a new non-local force emerges, and hence that the DM fluid deviates from the geodesic solutions of the field equations.

2024-07-23, **The stellar distribution in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies suggests deviations from the collision-less cold dark matter paradigm**, Jorge Sanchez Almeida et.al., [2407.16755v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16755v1)

 Unraveling the nature of dark matter (DM) stands as a primary objective in modern physics. Here we present evidence suggesting deviations from the collisionless Cold DM (CDM) paradigm. It arises from the radial distribution of stars in six Ultra Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxies measured with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). After a trivial renormalization in size and central density, the six UFDs show the same stellar distribution, which happens to have a central plateau or core. Assuming spherical symmetry and isotropic velocities, the Eddington inversion method proves the observed distribution to be inconsistent with potentials characteristic of CDM particles. Under such assumptions, the observed innermost slope of the stellar profile discards the UFDs to reside in a CDM potential at a > 97% confidence level. The extremely low stellar mass of these galaxies, 10**3-10**4 Msun , prevents stellar feedback from modifying the shape of a CDM potential. Other conceivable explanations for the observed cores, like deviations from spherical symmetry and isotropy, tidal forces, and the exact form of the used CDM potential, are disfavored by simulations and/or observations. Thus, the evidence suggests that collisions among DM particles or other alternatives to CDM are likely shaping these galaxies. Many of these alternatives produce cored gravitational potentials, shown here to be consistent with the observed stellar distribution.

2024-07-23, **Fractional Holographic Dark Energy**, Oem Trivedi et.al., [2407.16685v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16685v1)

 Holographic dark energy theories present a fascinating interface to probe late-time cosmology, as guided by contemporary ideas about quantum gravity. In this work, we present a new holographic dark energy scenario designated Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE). This model extends the conventional framework of HDEs by incorporating specific features from fractional calculus recently applied, e.g., in cosmological settings. In this manner, we retrieve a novel form of HDE energy density. We then show how FHDE can provide a consistent picture of the evolution of the late-time universe even with the simple choice of the Hubble horizon as the IR (infrared) cutoff. We provide detailed descriptions of the cosmological evolution, showing how the fractional calculus ingredients can alleviate quite a few issues associated with the conventional HDE scenario. Concretely, we compute and plot diagrams using the Hubble horizon cutoff for HDE. The density parameters for DE and dark matter (DM), the deceleration parameter, and the DE EoS parameter indicate how the universe may evolve within our FHDE model, fitting within an appropriate scenario of late-time cosmology.

2024-07-23, **Testing the interacting dark energy model in a phenomenological scenario with gamma-ray bursts and Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae**, X. D. Nong et.al., [2407.16644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16644v1)

 In this paper, we utilize recent observational data from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and Pantheon+ Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) sample to explore the interacting Dark Energy (IDE) model in a phenomenological scenario. Results from GRBs-only, SNe Ia and GRBs+SNe Ia indicate that the energy is transferred from dark energy to dark matter and the coincidence problem is alleviated. The value of H0 from GRBs+SNe Ia in the IDE scenario shows agreement with the SH0ES measurement. Considering the age estimate of the quasar APM 08279+5255 at z = 3.91, we find that the phenomenological IDE scenario can predict a cosmic age greater than that of the {\Lambda}CDM model, thus the cosmic age problem can be alleviated.

2024-07-23, **Constraining dark photon parameters based on the very high energy observations of blazars**, Tian-Ci Liu et.al., [2407.16628v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16628v1)

 Dark photon is a new gauge boson beyond the Standard Model as a kind of dark matter (DM) candidate. Dark photon dark matter (DPDM) interacts with electromagnetic fields via kinetic mixing, implicating an approach to give a constraint with extragalactic very high energy (VHE) sources. In this work, we attempt to constrain the kinetic mixing from the photon-dark photon scattering process in the host galaxy of blazar, the intergalactic medium and the Milky Way. The VHE photons from a blazar would pass through a dense DM spike around the supermassive black hole where the absorption from DPDM is dramatically enhanced. The kinetic mixing is constrained to be $\epsilon \sim 10^{-7}$ at a 95$\%$ confidence level with $m\_{\rm D}\sim 0.03 - 1$ eV mass range from the observations of Markarian (Mrk) 421 and Mrk 501.

2024-07-23, **Application of the Eddington inversion method to constrain the dark matter halo of galaxies using only observed surface brightness profiles**, Jorge Sanchez Almeida et.al., [2407.16519v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16519v1)

 *** Context: The halos of low-mass galaxies may allow us to constrain the nature of dark matter (DM), but the kinematic measurements to diagnose the required properties are technically extremely challenging. However, the photometry of these systems is doable. Aims. Using only stellar photometry, constrain key properties of the DM haloes in low-mass galaxies. *** Methods: Unphysical pairs of DM gravitational potentials and starlight distributions can be identified if the pair requires a distribution function f that is negative somewhere in the phase space. We use the classical Eddington inversion method (EIM) to compute f for a battery of DM gravitational potentials and around 100 observed low-mass galaxies with Mstar between 10**6 and 10**8 Msun. The battery includes NFW potentials (expected from cold DM) and potentials stemming from cored mass distributions (expected in many alternatives to cold DM). The method assumes spherical symmetry and isotropic velocity distribution and requires fitting the observed profiles with analytic functions, for which we use polytropes (with zero inner slope, a.k.a. core) and profiles with variable inner and outer slopes. The validity of all these assumptions is analyzed. *** Results: In general, the polytropes fit well the observed starlight profiles. If they were the correct fits (which could be the case) then all galaxies are inconsistent with NFW-like potentials. Alternatively, when the inner slope is allowed to vary for fitting, between 40% and 70% of the galaxies are consistent with cores in the stellar mass distribution and thus inconsistent with NFW-like potentials. *** Conclusions: Even though the stellar mass of the observed galaxies is still not low enough to constrain the nature of DM, this work shows the practical feasibility of the EIM technique to infer DM properties only from photometry.

2024-07-23, **An indirect search for dark matter with a combined analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies from VERITAS**, A. Acharyya et.al., [2407.16518v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16518v1)

 Understanding the nature and identity of dark matter is a key goal in the physics community. In the case that TeV-scale dark matter particles decay or annihilate into standard model particles, very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays (greater than 100 GeV) will be present in the final state. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array that can indirectly detect VHE gamma rays in an energy range of 100 GeV to > 30 TeV. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are ideal candidates in the search for dark matter due to their high dark matter content, high mass-to-light ratios, and their low gamma-ray fluxes from astrophysical processes. This study uses a legacy data set of 638 hours collected on 17 dSphs, built over 11 years with an observing strategy optimized according to the dark matter content of the targets. The study addresses a broad dark matter particle mass range, extending from 200 GeV to 30 PeV. In the absence of a detection, we set the upper limits on the dark matter velocity-weighted annihilation cross section.

2024-07-23, **Cosmic Web Dynamics: Forces and Strains**, Roi Kugel et.al., [2407.16489v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16489v1)

 This study concerns an inventory of the gravitational force and tidal field induced by filaments, walls, cluster nodes and voids on Megaparsec scales and how they assemble and shape the Cosmic Web. The study is based on a N$\_{\rm Part}=512^3$ $\Lambda$CDM dark matter only N-body simulation in a (300$h^{-1}$~Mpc)$^3$ box at $z=0$. We invoke the density field NEXUS+ multiscale morphological procedure to assign the appropriate morphological feature to each location. We then determine the contribution by each of the cosmic web components to the local gravitational and tidal forces. We find that filaments are, by far, the dominant dynamical component in the interior of filaments, in the majority of underdense void regions and in all wall regions. The gravitational influence of cluster nodes is limited, and they are only dominant in their immediate vicinity. The force field induced by voids is marked by divergent outflowing patterns, yielding the impression of a segmented volume in which voids push matter towards their boundaries. Voids manifest themselves strongly in the tidal field as a cellular tapestry that is closely linked to the multiscale cosmic web. However, even within the interior of voids, the dynamical influence of the surrounding filaments is stronger than the outward push by voids. Therefore, the dynamics of voids cannot be understood without taking into account the influence of the environment. We conclude that filaments constitute the overpowering gravitational agent of the cosmic web, while voids are responsible for the cosmic web's spatial organisation and hence of its spatial connectivity.

2024-07-23, **Dark Photon Dark Matter and Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection with Gaia-like Astrometry**, Haipeng An et.al., [2407.16488v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16488v1)

 Astrometric surveys offer us a method to search for elusive cosmic signatures, such as ultralight dark photon dark matter and gravitational waves, by observing the deflection to the apparent positions of the stars. The detection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies, because the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of stars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described by a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background subtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the advantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below $6 \times 10^{-9}~{\rm Hz}$. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational interactions, dark photons with additional $U(1)\_{B}$ or $U(1)\_{B-L}$ gauge interactions, and low-frequency gravitational waves as examples, we illustrate that the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than one order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the low-frequency range.

2024-07-23, **Constraints on scalar and vector dark matter admixed neutron stars with linear and quadratic couplings**, Francesco Grippa et.al., [2407.16386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16386v1)

 We study the effect of dark matter scalar and vector-mediated interactions on dark matter admixed neutron stars. In particular, we exploit the two-fluid formalism of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations as generic framework for dark matter admixed neutron stars. The fluids couple to each other only by gravity. In particular, the baryonic sector is described by the BSk22 equation of state, whereas we employ a relativistic mean field model for the dark matter, where we include the interaction of dark massive fermions with light dark scalar and vector mediators. We consider both the linear and the quadratic scalar interactions with the dark fermion. In the quadratic scalar scenario, we take into account a quartic self-interaction that significantly affects the stellar properties. Interestingly, in both cases, the effect of the scalar coupling is smaller than that of the vector, though quantitative differences arise. We also compute the sound speed of DM, finding that the scalar and quadratic couplings have an important influence on it. We compare our results with GW1708017, GW190425 and NICER data and constrain DM couplings and mass.

2024-07-23, **A smooth filament origin for prolate galaxies "going bananas" in deep JWST images**, Alvaro Pozo et.al., [2407.16339v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16339v1)

 We compare the abundant prolate shaped galaxies reported beyond z$>$3 in deep JWST surveys, with the predicted {\it stellar} appearance of young galaxies in detailed hydro-simulations of three main dark matter contenders: Cold (CDM), Wave/Fuzzy ($\psi$DM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM). We find the observed galaxy images closely resemble the elongated stellar appearance of young galaxies predicted for both $\psi$DM and WDM, during the first $\simeq$ 500Myr while material steadily accretes from long, smooth filaments. The dark mater halos of WDM and $\psi$DM also have pronounced, prolate elongation similar to the stars, indicating a shared, highly triaxial equilibrium. This is unlike CDM where the early stellar morphology is mainly spheroidal formed from fragmented filaments with frequent merging, resulting in modest triaxiality. Quantitatively, the excess of prolate galaxies observed by JWST matches well WDM and $\psi$DM for particle masses of 1.4KeV and $2.5\times 10^{-22}$ eV respectively. For CDM, several visible subhalos are typically predicted to orbit within the virial radius of each galaxy from subhalo accretion, whereas merging is initially rare for WDM and $\psi$DM. We also verify with our simulations that $\psi$DM may be distinguished from WDM by the form of the core, which is predicted to be smooth and centered for WDM, but is a dense soliton for $\psi$DM traced by stars and measurably offset from the galaxy center by random wave perturbations in the simulations. We emphasise that long smooth filaments absent of galaxies may prove detectable with JWST, traced by stars and gas with comoving lengths of 150kpc predicted at z$\simeq$10, depending on the particle mass of $\psi$DM or WDM.

2024-07-24, **Model-agnostic assessment of dark energy after DESI DR1 BAO**, Bikash R. Dinda et.al., [2407.17252v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17252v1)

 Baryon acoustic oscillation measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Data Release 1) have revealed exciting results that show evidence for dynamical dark energy at $\sim3\sigma$ when combined with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernova observations. These measurements are based on the $w\_0w\_a$CDM model of dark energy. The evidence is less in other dark energy models such as the $w$CDM model. To avoid imposing a dark energy model, we reconstruct the distance measures and the equation of the state of dark energy independent of any dark energy model and driven only by observational data. To this end, we use both single-task and multi-task Gaussian Process regression. Our results show that the model-agnostic evidence for dynamical dark energy is much less than the evidence from DESI with the $w\_0w\_a$CDM model. Our analysis also provides model-independent constraints on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the matter-energy density parameter at present. We find that the reconstructed values of these parameters are not consistent with the results reported in DESI with the $w\_0w\_a$CDM model. However, they are almost consistent with DESI for the $w$CDM model.

 The $f(R)$ modified gravity theory can explain the accelerating expansion of the late Universe without introducing dark energy. In this study, we predict the constraint strength on the $f(R)$ theory using the mock data generated from the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) Ultra-Deep Field (UDF) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) survey and wide-field slitless spectroscopic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) survey. We explore three popular $f(R)$ models, and introduce a parameter $b$ to characterize the deviation of the f(R) theory from the $\Lambda$CDM theory. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to constrain the parameters in the $f(R)$ models, and the nuisance parameters and systematical uncertainties are also considered in the model fitting process. Besides, we also perform model comparisons between the $f(R)$ models and the $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the constraint accuracy using the CSST SN Ia+BAO dataset alone is comparable to or even better than the result given by the combination of the current relevant observations, and the CSST SN Ia+BAO survey can distinguish the $f(R)$ models from the $\Lambda$CDM model. This indicates that the CSST SN Ia and BAO surveys can effectively constrain and test the $f(R)$ theory.

 Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through a viscous shell of matter are expected to be damped resulting in an increase in the temperature of the fluid as energy is transferred to it from the GWs. In previous work we constructed a model for this process, obtaining an expression for the temperature distribution inside the shell, and it was shown that the temperature increase can be astrophysically significant. In this paper we extend the analysis to GW heating and damping following a binary neutron star merger, GW heating during a core-collapse supernova, and primordial gravitational waves.

 Relativistic jets from a black hole (BH) following the core-collapse of a massive star (''collapsar'') is a leading model for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the two key ingredients for a Blandford-Znajek (BZ) powered jet $-$ rapid rotation and a strong magnetic field $-$ seem mutually exclusive. Strong fields in the progenitor star's core transport angular momentum outwards more quickly, slowing down the core before collapse. Using MESA stellar evolution models followed to core-collapse, we explicitly show that the small length-scale of the instabilities, likely responsible for angular momentum transport in the core (e.g., Tayler-Spruit), results in a low net magnetic flux fed to the BH horizon, far too small to power GRB jets. Instead, we propose a novel scenario in which collapsar BHs acquire their magnetic ''hair'' from their progenitor proto-neutron star (PNS), which is likely highly magnetized from an internal dynamo. We evaluate the conditions for the BH accretion disk to pin the PNS magnetosphere to its horizon immediately after the collapse. Our results show that the PNS's pre-collapse energy matches the excess energy in Ic-BL supernovae, while the nascent BH's spin and magnetic flux produce jets consistent with observed GRB characteristics. We map our MESA models to 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and confirm that accretion disks confine the strong magnetic flux initiated near a rotating BH, enabling the launch of successful GRB jets, whereas a slower spinning BH or one without a disk fails to do so. Our model indicates that standard GRB jets emerge whenever an accretion disk forms.

2024-07-23, **Evaluating Cosmological Biases using Photometric Redshifts for Type Ia Supernova Cosmology with the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program**, R. Chen et.al., [2407.16744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16744v1)

 Cosmological analyses with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have traditionally been reliant on spectroscopy for both classifying the type of supernova and obtaining reliable redshifts to measure the distance-redshift relation. While obtaining a host-galaxy spectroscopic redshift for most SNe is feasible for small-area transient surveys, it will be too resource intensive for upcoming large-area surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, which will observe on the order of millions of SNe. Here we use data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to address this problem with photometric redshifts (photo-z) inferred directly from the SN light-curve in combination with Gaussian and full p(z) priors from host-galaxy photo-z estimates. Using the DES 5-year photometrically-classified SN sample, we consider several photo-z algorithms as host-galaxy photo-z priors, including the Self-Organizing Map redshifts (SOMPZ), Bayesian Photometric Redshifts (BPZ), and Directional-Neighbourhood Fitting (DNF) redshift estimates employed in the DES 3x2 point analyses. With detailed catalog-level simulations of the DES 5-year sample, we find that the simulated w can be recovered within $\pm$0.02 when using SN+SOMPZ or DNF prior photo-z, smaller than the average statistical uncertainty for these samples of 0.03. With data, we obtain biases in w consistent with simulations within ~1$\sigma$ for three of the five photo-z variants. We further evaluate how photo-z systematics interplay with photometric classification and find classification introduces a subdominant systematic component. This work lays the foundation for next-generation fully photometric SNe Ia cosmological analyses.

2024-07-23, **Robust Preference for Dynamical Dark Energy in DESI BAO and SN Measurements**, William Giarè et.al., [2407.16689v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16689v1)

 Recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck and two different samples of Type Ia supernovae (Pantheon-Plus and DESY5) reveal a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) characterized by a present-day quintessence-like equation of state that crossed into the phantom regime in the past. A core ansatz for this result is assuming a linear Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization $w(a) = w\_0 + w\_a (1-a)$ to describe the evolution of the DE equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we test if and to what extent this assumption impacts the results. To prevent broadening uncertainties in cosmological parameter inference and facilitate direct comparison with the baseline CPL case, we focus on 4 alternative well-known models that, just like CPL, consist of only two free parameters: the present-day DE EoS ($w\_0$) and a parameter quantifying its dynamical evolution ($w\_a$). We demonstrate that the preference for DDE remains robust regardless of the parameterization: $w\_0$ consistently remains in the quintessence regime, while $w\_a$ consistently indicates a preference for a dynamical evolution towards the phantom regime. This tendency is significantly strengthened by DESY5 SN measurements. By comparing the best-fit $\chi^2$ obtained within each DDE model, we notice that the linear CPL parameterization is not the best-fitting case. Among the models considered, the EoS proposed by Barboza and Alcaniz consistently leads to the most significant improvement.

2024-07-23, **Testing the interacting dark energy model in a phenomenological scenario with gamma-ray bursts and Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae**, X. D. Nong et.al., [2407.16644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16644v1)

 In this paper, we utilize recent observational data from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and Pantheon+ Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) sample to explore the interacting Dark Energy (IDE) model in a phenomenological scenario. Results from GRBs-only, SNe Ia and GRBs+SNe Ia indicate that the energy is transferred from dark energy to dark matter and the coincidence problem is alleviated. The value of H0 from GRBs+SNe Ia in the IDE scenario shows agreement with the SH0ES measurement. Considering the age estimate of the quasar APM 08279+5255 at z = 3.91, we find that the phenomenological IDE scenario can predict a cosmic age greater than that of the {\Lambda}CDM model, thus the cosmic age problem can be alleviated.

2024-07-23, **Spectroscopic analysis of the strongly lensed SN~Encore: Constraints on cosmic evolution of Type Ia supernovae**, S. Dhawan et.al., [2407.16492v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16492v1)

 Strong gravitational lensing magnifies the light from a background source, allowing us to study these sources in detail. Here, we study the spectra of a $z = 1.95$ lensed Type Ia supernova SN~Encore for its brightest Image A, taken 39 days apart. We infer the spectral age with template matching using the supernova identification (SNID) software and find the spectra to be at 29.0 $\pm 5.0$ and 37.4 $\pm 2.8$ rest-frame days post maximum respectively, consistent with separation in the observer frame after accounting for time-dilation. Since SNe~Ia measure dark energy properties by providing relative distances between low- and high-$z$ SNe, it is important to test for evolution of spectroscopic properties. Comparing the spectra to composite low-$z$ SN~Ia spectra, we find strong evidence for similarity between the local sample of SN~Encore. The line velocities of common SN~Ia spectral lines, Si II 6355 and Ca II NIR triplet are consistent with the distribution for the low-$z$ sample as well as other lensed SNe~Ia, e.g. iPTF16geu ($z = 0.409$) and SN~H0pe ($z = 1.78$). The consistency in SN~Ia spectra across cosmic time demonstrates the utility of using SNe~Ia in the very high-$z$ universe for dark energy inference. We also find that the spectra of SN~Encore match the predictions for explosion models very well. With future large samples of lensed SNe~Ia, spectra at such late phases will be important to distinguish between different explosion scenarios.

2024-07-23, **Pair-instability evolution and explosions in massive stars**, M. Renzo et.al., [2407.16113v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16113v1)

 Very massive stars are radiation pressure dominated. Before running out of viable nuclear fuel, they can reach a thermodynamic state where electron-positron pair-production robs them of radiation support, triggering their collapse. Thermonuclear explosion(s) in the core ensue. These have long been predicted to result in either repeated episodic mass loss (pulsational pair instability), which reduces the mass available to eventually form a black hole, or, if sufficient energy is generated, the complete unbinding of all stellar material in one single explosive episode (pair instability supernova), which leaves behind no black hole. Despite theoretical agreement among modelers, the wide variety of predicted signatures and the rarity of very high-mass stellar progenitors have so far resulted in a lack of observational confirmation. Nevertheless, because of the impact of pair instability evolution on black hole masses relevant to gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as the present and upcoming expanded capabilities of time-domain astronomy and high redshift spectroscopy, interest in these explosion remains high. We review the current understanding of pair instability evolution, with particular emphasis on the known uncertainties. We also summarize the existing claimed electromagnetic counterparts and discuss prospects for future direct and indirect searches.
