2024-02-21, **Neutrino phenomenology and keV dark matter in 2HDM with $A_4$ symmetry**, V. V. Vien et.al., [2402.13967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13967v1)

 We propose a minimal extended seesaw scheme based on the discrete symmetry $A\_4\times Z\_4\times Z\_2\times Z\_8$ which can successfully address neutrino phenomenology and keV sterile neutrino dark matter. The lepton mass hierarchy is naturally achieved. Active neutrino mixing angles can reached the best-fit points with the predictive Dirac CP violation phase. The active-sterile mixing matrix elements are small enough to access the observed cosmological dark matter abundance constraint with keV sterile neutrino dark matter. The effective neutrino masses are predicted to be in the ranges of the recent experimental limits.

2024-02-21, **Dark population transfer mechanism for sterile neutrino dark matter**, George M. Fuller et.al., [2402.13878v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13878v1)

 We present a mechanism for producing a cosmologically-significant relic density of one or more sterile neutrinos. This scheme invokes two steps: First, a population of "heavy" sterile neutrinos is created by scattering-induced decoherence of active neutrinos; Second, this population is transferred, via sterile neutrino self-interaction-mediated scatterings and decays, to one or more lighter mass ($\sim 10\,{\rm keV}$ to $\sim 1\,{\rm GeV}$) sterile neutrinos that are far more weakly (or not at all) mixed with active species and could constitute dark matter. Dark matter produced this way can evade current electromagnetic and structure-based bounds, but may nevertheless be probed by future observations.

2024-02-21, **Theoretical analysis and predictions for the double electron capture of $^{124}$Xe**, Ovidiu Niţescu et.al., [2402.13784v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13784v1)

 We provide a complete theoretical description of the two-neutrino electron capture in $^{124}$Xe, improving both the nuclear and the atomic structure calculations. We improve the general formalism through the use of the Taylor expansion method, leading to higher order terms in the decay rate of the process. The nuclear part is treated with pn-QRPA and interacting shell model (ISM) methods. The nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) are calculated with the pn-QRPA method with spin restoration by fixing the input parameters so that the experimental decay rate is reproduced, resulting in values significantly lower than in previous calculations. The validity of the pn-QRPA NMEs is tested by showing their values to be comparable with the ones for double-beta decay with emission of two electrons of $^{128,130}$Te, which have similar pairing features. Within the ISM, we reproduce the total experimental half-life within a factor of two and predict the capture fraction to the KK channel of about 74\%. We also predict the capture fractions to other decay channels and show that for the cumulative decay to the $\rm{KL\_{1}}$-$\rm{KO\_{1}}$ channels, a capture fraction of about 24\% could be observed experimentally. On the atomic side, calculations are improved by accounting for the Pauli blocking of the decay of innermost nucleon states and by considering all $s$-wave electrons available for capture, expanding beyond the K and L$\_1$ orbitals considered in previous studies. We also provide improved atomic relaxation energies of the final atomic states of $^{124}$Te, which may be used as input for background modeling in liquid Xenon experiments.

2024-02-21, **Construction of Yemilab**, K. S. Park et.al., [2402.13708v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13708v1)

 The Center for Underground Physics of the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Korea has been planning the construction of a deep underground laboratory since 2013 to search for extremely rare interactions such as dark matter and neutrinos. In September 2022, a new underground laboratory, Yemilab, was finally completed in Jeongseon, Gangwon Province, with a depth of 1,000 m and an exclusive experimental area spanning 3,000 m$^3$. The tunnel is encased in limestone and accommodates 17 independent experimental spaces. Over two years, from 2023 to 2024, the Yangyang Underground Laboratory facilities will be relocated to Yemilab. Preparations are underway for the AMoRE-II, a neutrinoless double beta decay experiment, scheduled to begin in Q2 2024 at Yemilab. Additionally, Yemilab includes a cylindrical pit with a volume of approximately 6,300 m$^3$, designed as a multipurpose laboratory for next-generation experiments involving neutrinos, dark matter, and related research. This article provides a focused overview of the construction and structure of Yemilab.

2024-02-21, **Developing a $μ$Bq/m$^{3}$ level $^{226}$Ra concentration in water measurement system for the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory**, C. Li et.al., [2402.13614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13614v1)

 The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20~kton multi-purpose low background Liquid Scintillator (LS) detector, was proposed primarily to determine the neutrino mass ordering. To suppress the radioactivity from the surrounding rocks and tag cosmic muons, the JUNO central detector is submerged in a Water Cherenkov Detector (WCD). In addition to being used in the WCD, ultrapure water is used in LS filling, for which the $^{226}$Ra concentration in water needs to be less than 50~$\mu$Bq/m$^3$. To precisely measure the $^{226}$Ra concentration in water, a 6.0~$\mu$Bq/m$^3$ $^{226}$Ra concentration in water measurement system has been developed. In this paper, the detail of the measurement system as well as the $^{226}$Ra concentration measurement result in regular EWII ultrapure water will be presented.

2024-02-21, **The Main Electrode System of the Nab Experiment and the Analysis of the Performance in the Measurement of the Fierz Term b**, Huangxing Li et.al., [2402.13559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13559v1)

 The Nab collaboration will study free neutron beta decay at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Lab. A neutron decays into a proton, an electron and an anti-neutrino in this process, where the energy of the outgoing protons and electrons are collected to determine (1) the electron-antineutrino correlation co-efficient $a$ to the precision of \|$\Delta a/a$\|<=$10^{-3}$ and (2) the Fierz interference term $b$ to the precision of \|$\Delta b/b$\|<=$3*10^{-3}$. From the measurement of $a$, we can calculate the axial-vector to vector coupling ratio $\lambda$. Together with the neutron lifetime measurement, we could also calculate the upper right element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa Matrix, and test the unitarity of that matrix. The measurement of $b$ could shed light on the physics beyond the Standard Model since $b$ is predicted to be 0 by the $V-A$ structure of weak interaction in the Standard Model. This thesis presents the design of Nab electrode system, and the solution to a major systematic effect in the measurement of $a$: the requirement of having a low electrical field environment in the neutron decay region. The electrode system has been built and installed successfully, and as our characterization and its analysis shows, the electrode system meets the required specifications. This thesis also gives a systematic uncertainty study for $b$ measurement and provides a table of the requirements for the $b$ measurement...

2024-02-21, **Exploring Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves with R-Symmetric GUT Higgs Inflation**, Nadir Ijaz et.al., [2402.13924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13924v1)

 This study investigates the realization of R-symmetric Higgs inflation within the framework of no-scale-like supergravity, aiming to elucidate the formation of primordial black holes and observable gravitational waves within a class of GUT models. We explore the possibility of an ultra-slow-roll phase in a hybrid inflation framework, where the GUT Higgs field primarily takes on the role of the inflaton. The amplification of the scalar power spectrum gives rise to scalar-induced gravitational waves and the generation of primordial black holes. The predicted stochastic gravitational wave background falls within the sensitivity range of existing and upcoming gravitational wave detectors, while primordial black holes hold the potential to explain the abundance of dark matter. Furthermore, we highlight the significance of the leading-order nonrenormalizable term in the superpotential of achieving inflationary observables consistent with the latest experimental data. Additionally, the predicted range of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, a key measure of primordial gravitational waves, lies within the observational window of future experiments searching for B-mode polarization patterns in cosmic microwave background data.

2024-02-21, **Estimating the dark matter halo velocity and surface temperature of some known pulsars due to dark matter capture**, Debashree Sen et.al., [2402.13795v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13795v1)

 Considering four known pulsars J1906+0746, J1933-6211, J2043+1711 and the Vela pulsar, we study the scenario of dark matter (DM) capture in neutron stars (NSs). For the purpose we choose four well-known relativistic mean field models to obtain the radius corresponding to the observed mass of these pulsars and consequently the scattering cross-section of DM with the different particles of the $\beta$ stable NS matter. The estimated DM-electron scattering cross-section in this work is stringent compared to the current direct detection experimental probe. We then compute the lower limit on the halo velocity of DM for the four pulsars from the knowledge of the upper limit on effective temperature of the individual pulsars. We also extend our work to calculate the value of the effective temperature with the different models using the fitted values of the halo velocity of DM of the four pulsars with respect to their distances from the galactic center. Our findings are consistent with the analysis of the observed data.

2024-02-21, **Sharpening the dark matter signature in gravitational waveforms II: Numerical simulations with the NbodyIMRI code**, Bradley J. Kavanagh et.al., [2402.13762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13762v1)

 Future gravitational wave observatories can probe dark matter by detecting the dephasing in the waveform of binary black hole mergers induced by dark matter overdensities. Such a detection hinges on the accurate modelling of the dynamical friction, induced by dark matter on the secondary compact object in intermediate and extreme mass ratio inspirals. In this paper, we introduce NbodyIMRI, a new publicly available code designed for simulating binary systems within cold dark matter `spikes'. Leveraging higher particle counts and finer timesteps, we validate the applicability of the standard dynamical friction formalism and provide an accurate determination of the maximum impact parameter of particles which can effectively scatter with a compact object, across various mass ratios. We also show that in addition to feedback due to dynamical friction, the dark matter also evolves through a `stirring' effect driven by the time-dependent potential of the binary. We introduce a simple semi-analytical scheme to account for this effect and demonstrate that including stirring tends to slow the rate of dark matter depletion and therefore enhances the impact of dark matter on the dynamics of the binary.

2024-02-21, **Leaving No Matter Unturned -- Analysing existing LHC measurements and events with jets and missing transverse energy measured by the ATLAS Experiment insearch of Dark Matter**, Martin Habedank et.al., [2402.13760v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13760v1)

 Various astrophysical observations point towards an as-of-yet unexplained, mainly gravitationally interacting type of matter. If this matter, called Dark Matter, is an elementary particle, it could be produced in particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Given its weak interaction with ordinary matter, however, it would not be directly observable with the general-purpose detectors at the Large Hadron Collider. Its production would therefore manifest as events in which detector-visible objects recoil against the detector-invisible Dark Matter, giving rise to missing transverse energy. This thesis focuses on final states in which these visible objects are jets.   A measurement of the final state of large missing transverse energy and at least one jet in 139 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider is performed in this thesis. Good agreement between measured data and Standard-Model prediction is found in a statistical fit, corresponding to a reduced chi-square of 1.37. The measurement is corrected for detector effects to facilitate later reinterpretation. Measurements prepared in such a way can, for example, be exploited by the CONTUR toolkit to set constraints on new theories. Both, the results of the measurement and the CONTUR toolkit making use of existing measurements at the Large Hadron Collider, are employed to set exclusion limits on a model able to explain Dark Matter, the two-Higgs-doublet model with a pseudoscalar mediator to Dark Matter. At $\tan\beta=1$, masses of the pseudoscalar $A$ up to 425 GeV and larger than 1600 GeV are excluded at 95 % confidence level. At $m\_H\equiv m\_A\equiv m\_{H^\pm}=$ 600 GeV, masses of the pseudoscalar $a$ up to 550 GeV and values of $\tan\beta$ up to 1.5 as well as larger than 20 are excluded at 95 % confidence level.

2024-02-21, **Einstein's basement -- a model for dark matter and an expanding universe?**, Fritz Riehle et.al., [2402.13679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13679v1)

 We present a model treating the energy-momentum relation of relativistic particles as the upper branch of a generalized energy-momentum relation emerging from a forbidden crossing between the constant energy of a massive particle and the photon line. The lower branch, a regime dubbed as Einstein's basement, gives rise to particles with different kinematics that is analysed in the low-velocity limit. Allowing for gravitational interaction between those particles, and between particles of both branches, we discuss whether particles in Einstein's basement might be suitable dark matter candidates. Moreover, the special dynamics of mixed systems leads to an expansion mechanism for regular matter in space. Tests of the presented model by astronomical observations are suggested.

2024-02-21, **A proposed PKU-Muon experiment for muon tomography and dark matter search**, Xudong Yu et.al., [2402.13483v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13483v1)

 We propose here a set of new methods to directly detect light mass dark matter through its scattering with abundant atmospheric muons or accelerator beams. Firstly, we plan to use the free cosmic-ray muons interacting with dark matter in a volume surrounded by tracking detectors, to trace possible interaction between dark matter and muons. Secondly, we will interface our device with domestic or international muon beams. Due to much larger muon intensity and focused beam, we anticipate the detector can be made further compact and the resulting sensitivity on dark matter searches will be improved. In line with above projects, we will develop muon tomography methods and apply them on atmospheric and environmental sciences, archaeology and civil engineering. Furthermore, we will measure precisely directional distributions of cosmic-ray muons, either at mountain or sea level, and the differences may reveal possible information of dark matter distributed near the earth. In the future, we may also extend our study to muon on target experiments.

2024-02-21, **Exploring the dependence of the Hubble constant from the cluster-lensed supernova SN Refsdal on mass model assumptions**, Yuting Liu et.al., [2402.13476v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13476v1)

 The Hubble constant, $H\_0$, which is a crucial parameter in astrophysics and cosmology, is under significant tension. We explore an independent technique to measure $H\_0$ based on the time-delay cosmography with strong gravitational lensing of a supernova lensed by a galaxy cluster, focusing on SN Refsdal in MACS J1149.5+2223, the first gravitationally lensed supernova with resolved multiple images. We carefully examine the dependence of constraints on the Hubble constant on the choice of lens mass models, employing 23 lens mass models with different assumptions on dark matter halos and external perturbations. Remarkably, we observe that the dependence on the choice of lens mass models is not significantly large, suggesting the robustness of the constraint on the Hubble constant from SN Refsdal. We combine measurements for the 23 lens mass models to obtain $H\_0=70.0^{+4.7}\_{-4.9}km/s/Mpc$ assuming equal weighting. We find that best-fitting Hubble constant values correlate with radial density profiles of the lensing cluster, implying a room for improving the constraint on the Hubble constant with future observations of more multiple images. We also find a clear correlation between best-fitting Hubble constant values and magnification factors of supernova multiple images. This correlation highlights the importance of gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae for accurate and robust Hubble constant measurements.

2024-02-21, **JWST MIRI Imager Observations of Supernova SN 1987A**, P. Bouchet et.al., [2402.14014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14014v1)

 There exist very few mid-infrared (IR) observations of supernovae (SNe) in general. Therefore, SN 1987A, the closest visible SN in 400 years, gives us the opportunity to explore the mid-IR properties of SNe, the dust in their ejecta and surrounding medium, and to witness the birth of a SN remnant (SNR). The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high spatial resolution and extreme sensitivity, gives a new view on these issues. We report on the first imaging observations obtained with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI). We build temperature maps and discuss the morphology of the nascent SNR. Our results show that the temperatures in the equatorial ring (ER) are quite non-uniform. This could be due to dust destruction in some parts of the ring, as had been assumed in some previous works. We show that the IR emission extends beyond the ER, illustrating the fact that the shock wave has now passed through this ring to affect the circumstellar medium on a larger scale. Finally, while sub-mm Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations have hinted at the location of the compact remnant of SN 1987A, we note that our MIRI data have found no such evidence.

2024-02-21, **WiFeS observations of nearby southern Type Ia supernova host galaxies**, Anthony Carr et.al., [2402.13484v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13484v1)

 We present high-resolution observations of nearby ($z\lesssim 0.1$) galaxies that have hosted Type Ia supernovae to measure systemic spectroscopic redshifts using the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) instrument on the Australian National University 2.3 m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory. While most of the galaxies targeted have previous spectroscopic redshifts, we provide demonstrably more accurate and precise redshifts with competitive uncertainties, motivated by potential systematic errors that could bias estimates of the Hubble constant ($H\_0$). The WiFeS instrument is remarkably stable; after calibration, the wavelength solution varies by $\lesssim 0.5$ \r{A} in red and blue with no evidence of a trend over the course of several years. By virtue of the $25\times 38$ arcsec field of view, we are always able to redshift the galactic core, or the entire galaxy in the cases where its angular extent is smaller than the field of view, reducing any errors due to galaxy rotation. We observed 185 southern SN Ia host galaxies and redshifted each via at least one spatial region of a) the core, and b) the average over the full-field/entire galaxy. Overall, we find stochastic differences between historical redshifts and our measured redshifts on the order of $\lesssim 10^{-3}$ with a mean offset of $4.3\times 10^{-5}$, and normalised median absolute deviation of $1.2\times 10^{-4}$. We show that a systematic redshift offset at this level is not enough to bias cosmology, as $H\_0$ shifts by $+0.1$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ when we replace Pantheon+ redshifts with our own, but the occasional large differences are interesting to note.
