2024-08-26, **Dirac Neutrinos and Dark Matter within a Minimal Discrete Symmetry Model**, Yakefu Reyimuaji et.al., [2408.14166v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14166v1)

 We present a model that extends the standard model by incorporating the simplest discrete symmetry groups, $Z\_2$ and $Z\_3$. This model introduces vector-like leptons and a real scalar singlet. Based on this framework, we generate Dirac neutrino masses and explain the neutrino normal mass ordering. The model also aligns well with current oscillation data regarding theoretical values of the leptonic mixing angles and the Dirac CP-violating phase. Furthermore, it predicts that the atmospheric mixing angle falls in the higher octant and proposes a viable dark matter candidate. We discuss the phenomenological aspects and future testability of the model.

2024-08-26, **Spontaneous CP violation, sterile neutrino dark matter, and leptogenesis**, Yanjin Jiang et.al., [2408.13990v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13990v1)

 We constructed a model for spontaneous CP symmetry breaking in five-dimensional space-time that solves the strong CP problem. To explain the nature of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe, three right-handed neutrinos and $U(1)\_{B-L}$ gauge interaction are introduced in the bulk, in addition to the field contents of the Bento-Branco-Parada model. The wave-function profiles in the fifth dimension can suppress dangerous operators allowed by symmetries, and the scale of spontaneous CP symmetry breaking can be sufficiently large to be consistent with thermal leptogenesis. In this model, the lightest right-handed neutrino serves as dark matter with a mass of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ keV. This small mass and the necessarily small mixing are explained by the exponentially localized wave-function in the fifth dimension due to a bulk mass term. The correct relic abundance is achieved thanks to the $U(1)\_{B-L}$ gauge interaction. The other heavy right-handed neutrinos explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe through leptogenesis, with the required CP violating phases generated by interactions involving heavy leptons.

2024-08-25, **Low injection rate of cosmic-ray protons in the turbulent reacceleration model of radio halos in galaxy clusters**, Kosuke Nishiwaki et.al., [2408.13846v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13846v1)

 A giant radio halo (RH) is a diffuse synchrotron emission observed on the scale of megaparsecs (Mpc), typically found in the central region of merging galaxy clusters. Its large size and steep spectrum suggest that it originates from the re-energization of an aged population of cosmic ray electrons (CREs), while the secondary leptons produced in the $pp$ hadronic collision of cosmic ray protons (CRPs) may contribute to the emission. In this study, we investigate the reacceleration model including both primary and secondary CREs, assuming that the primary CRs originate from internal galaxies. In our new method, we follow the cosmological evolution of each cluster and calculate the energy spectra and one-dimensional spatial distributions of CRs. The primary CRE model with $\sim 3$ Gyr duration of reacceleration successfully reproduces the statistical properties of the RHs observed in the recent LOFAR survey, as well as the spectrum and profile of the Coma cluster. The gamma-ray and neutrino emissions produced by reaccelerated CRPs are consistent with the upper limits. However, if the CRP injection rate is high and the secondary CREs become significant, the model with the required $\sim 3$ Gyr reacceleration overproduces the number of RHs. The limit on the CRP injection rate, $L\_{\rm p} \lesssim 10^{41}$ erg/s, is significantly lower than that expected from the early starburst activity or jets from active galactic nuclei. This discrepancy requires a revision of either the model of CR supply from galaxies or the turbulent reacceleration model.

2024-08-26, **Discovering an invisible Z' at the muon collider**, Anjan Kumar Barik et.al., [2408.14396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14396v1)

 We show in this letter how a heavy $(\mathcal{O}(TeV))$ invisible $Z'$ gauge boson that will practically be out of reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can be discovered at the future muon collider. The new force carrier has a relatively stronger coupling with the beyond standard model (BSM) sector, while its interaction with the SM fields is much weaker. This weaker coupling is induced through mixing mechanisms, specifically via gauge kinetic mixing and the $Z-Z'$ mixing. We consider a scenario where the new gauge boson decays mostly to charge-neutral long-lived particles and/or dark matter (DM). We show how producing and detecting this heavier invisible $Z'$, that will be beyond the reach of even the very high luminosity LHC, becomes possible if it is produced in association with an energetic photon at the future muon collider. The on-shell production of the $Z'$ will lead to a peak in the photon energy distribution, following the so-called radiative return phenomena and can lead to the accurate determination of the $Z'$ mass and its interaction with SM particles.

2024-08-26, **Constraints on primordial black holes in dSphs using radio observations**, Tian-Ci Liu et.al., [2408.14353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14353v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical objects formed at the early epoch of the universe, which could be a type of dark matter (DM) candidate without the need for new particles. The abundance of PBH DM has been constrained strictly by many observations.In this work, with the radio observations of Fornax and Segue I, we constrain the abundance of PBH in dwarf spheroidal galaxies through the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) effect of Hawking radiation electrons. By selecting optimal sources, we obtain the constraints on the fraction of PBH DM down to $\sim10^{-3}$ for Segue I and $\sim10^{-5}$ for Fornax at asteroidal mass. We also predict that, with 100 hours of future observation by the Square Kilometer Array, the SSC approach could place constraints comparable to the current strictest results for PBHs of $<5\times10^{15}\,{\rm g}$. Better projected constraints can be obtained by including the inverse Compton scattering on cosmic microwave background photons.

2024-08-26, **Cosmology and nuclear-physics implications of a subsolar gravitational-wave event**, Francesco Crescimbeni et.al., [2408.14287v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14287v1)

 Detecting a compact subsolar object would have profound implications in physics, the reach of which depends on the nature of the object. Here we explore such consequences for a putative subsolar-mass gravitational wave event detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We forecast that the nature of a subsolar binary (made of light neutron stars, primordial black holes, or more exotic compact objects) can be inferred with a great statistical confidence level already during the ongoing fourth observing run, based on the large tidal deformability effects on the signal. The detection of a primordial black hole would have implications for cosmology and dark matter scenarios, while the measurement of the tidal deformability of a subsolar neutron star could rule out or confirm the existence of strange stars made of quarks.

2024-08-26, **GALPs! Composite heavy axion-like Dark Matter**, Pierluca Carenza et.al., [2408.14245v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14245v1)

 We propose a novel class of Dark Matter (DM) candidates in the form of a heavy composite Axion-Like Particle (ALP) with highly suppressed electromagnetic interactions, being stable even for masses exceeding the GeV scale. We argue that such a composite ALP emerges as a bound state -- the dark glueball -- due to confinement in a pure Yang-Mills dark sector. In a minimal ultraviolet complete QCD-like model, cosmological production of dark gluons as well as photons occurs via heavy fermion annihilation which effectively reheats both the dark and visible sectors setting up their temperature scales. Furthermore, effective interactions between glueballs and photons, resembling those of standard ALPs, are radiatively generated by heavy fermion loops. Consequently, DM glueballs interacting with photons are dubbed `Glueball ALPs' (GALPs). We uncover novel phenomenology of GALPs focusing on their unique astrophysical and cosmological signatures.

2024-08-26, **Benchmarking the design of the cryogenics system for the underground argon in DarkSide-20k**, DarkSide-20k Collaboration et.al., [2408.14071v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14071v1)

 DarkSide-20k (DS-20k) is a dark matter detection experiment under construction at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy. It utilises ~100 t of low radioactivity argon from an underground source (UAr) in its inner detector, with half serving as target in a dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC). The UAr cryogenics system must maintain stable thermodynamic conditions throughout the experiment's lifetime of >10 years. Continuous removal of impurities and radon from the UAr is essential for maximising signal yield and mitigating background. We are developing an efficient and powerful cryogenics system with a gas purification loop with a target circulation rate of 1000 slpm. Central to its design is a condenser operated with liquid nitrogen which is paired with a gas heat exchanger cascade, delivering a combined cooling power of >8 kW. Here we present the design choices in view of the DS-20k requirements, in particular the condenser's working principle and the cooling control, and we show test results obtained with a dedicated benchmarking platform at CERN and LNGS. We find that the thermal efficiency of the recirculation loop, defined in terms of nitrogen consumption per argon flow rate, is 95 % and the pressure in the test cryostat can be maintained within $\pm$(0.1-0.2) mbar. We further detail a 5-day cool-down procedure of the test cryostat, maintaining a cooling rate typically within -2 K/h, as required for the DS-20k inner detector. Additionally, we assess the circuit's flow resistance, and the heat transfer capabilities of two heat exchanger geometries for argon phase change, used to provide gas for recirculation. We conclude by discussing how our findings influence the finalisation of the system design, including necessary modifications to meet requirements and ongoing testing activities.

2024-08-26, **Implications of Fermionic Dark Matter Interactions on Anisotropic Neutron Stars**, Premachand Mahapatra et.al., [2408.14020v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14020v1)

 The presence of Dark matter (DM) within a neutron star (NS) can substantially influence the macroscopic properties. It is commonly assumed that the pressure inside an NS is isotropic, but in reality, pressure is locally anisotropic. This study explores the properties of anisotropic NS with a subfraction of DM (isotropic) trapped inside. Implementing a two-fluid formalism with three Equations of State (EOS): AP3 (a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction model), BSk22 (modeling atomic nuclei and neutron-matter), and MPA1 (considering relativistic effects in nuclear interactions). The properties of NS, such as mass ($M$), radius ($R$), and dimensionless tidal deformability ($\Lambda$), for various DM-anisotropic configurations, have been rigorously tested against observational constraints. These constraints include data from the binary NS merger GW170817, NICER x-ray measurements, and pulsar mass-radius observations. We observe that with increasing DM subfraction, higher anisotropies could also satisfy the observational constraints. Furthermore, increasing the coupling ($g$) between DM and its mediator leads to the formation of a core-halo structure, with a DM halo surrounding the baryonic matter (BM). Specifically, for coupling values of $g = 10^{-4}$, $10^{-3.7}$, and $10^{-3.5}$, we observe that the maximum radius ($R\_{max}$) decreases with increasing anisotropy, which contrasts with the behavior at $g = 10^{-5}$ and in scenarios with no DM. Our analysis indicates that binary pulsar systems could potentially constrain the extent of admixed anisotropic NS or, more optimistically, provide evidence for the existence of DM-admixed anisotropic NS.

2024-08-26, **Can supernova from runaway stars mimic the signs of absorbing `super-virial' gas?**, Mukesh Singh Bisht et.al., [2408.14351v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14351v1)

 The recent detection of large column density absorption lines from highly ionized gas in a few directions through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way (MW) has been puzzling. The inferred temperature from these absorption lines far exceeds the virial temperature of the MW, and the column densities are also too large to be easily explained. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to explain these observations and claim that they may not have originated from the CGM, but from a totally different type of source, namely, stellar ejecta from supernovae (SNe) above the Galactic disk that happen to lie in the line of sight to the background quasars. About $\sim 20\%$ of massive OB stars (progenitors of core-collapse supernovae) are known to be runaway stars that have high ejection velocities near the Galactic plane and can end up exploding as SNe above the Galactic disk. We show that the associated reverse shock in the supernova remnant in the early non-radiative phase can heat the ejecta to temperatures of $\gtrsim 10^7\,{\rm K}$ and can naturally explain the observed high column density of ions in the observed `super-virial' phase along with $\alpha$-enriched super-solar abundance that is typical of core-collapse supernovae. However, SNe from runaway stars has a covering fraction of $\lesssim 0.7 \%$ and thus can only explain the observations along limited sightlines.

2024-08-26, **The XRISM First Light Observation: Velocity Structure and Thermal Properties of the Supernova Remnant N132D**, XRISM Collaboration et.al., [2408.14301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14301v1)

 We present an initial analysis of the XRISM first-light observation of the supernova remnant (SNR) N132D in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Resolve microcalorimeter has obtained the first high-resolution spectrum in the 1.6-10 keV band, which contains K-shell emission lines of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe. We find that the Si and S lines are relatively narrow, with a broadening represented by a Gaussian-like velocity dispersion of $\sigma\_v \sim 450$ km s$^{-1}$. The Fe He$\alpha$ lines are, on the other hand, substantially broadened with $\sigma\_v \sim 1670$ km s$^{-1}$. This broadening can be explained by a combination of the thermal Doppler effect due to the high ion temperature and the kinematic Doppler effect due to the SNR expansion. Assuming that the Fe He$\alpha$ emission originates predominantly from the supernova ejecta, we estimate the reverse shock velocity at the time when the bulk of the Fe ejecta were shock heated to be $-1000 \lesssim V\_{\rm rs}~[{\rm km s}^{-1}] \lesssim 3300$ (in the observer frame). We also find that Fe Ly$\alpha$ emission is redshifted with a bulk velocity of $\sim 890$ km s$^{-1}$, substantially larger than the radial velocity of the local interstellar medium surrounding N132D. These results demonstrate that high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is capable of providing constraints on the evolutionary stage, geometry, and velocity distribution of SNRs.

2024-08-25, **The long-term influence of a magnetar power in stripped-envelope supernovae. Radiative-transfer modeling of He-star explosions from 1 to 10 years**, Luc Dessart et.al., [2408.13844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13844v1)

 Much interest surrounds the nature of the compact remnant formed in core collapse supernovae (SNe). One means to constrain its nature is to search for signatures of power injection from the remnant in the SN observables years after explosion. In this work, we conduct a large grid of 1D nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations of He-star explosions under the influence of magnetar-power injection from post-explosion age of about one to ten years. Our results for SN observables vary with He-star mass, SN age, injected power, or ejecta clumping. At high mass, the ejecta coolants are primarily O and Ne, with [OI]6330A, [OII]7325A, and [OIII]5000A dominating in the optical, and with strong [NeII]12.81micron in the infrared -- this line may carry more than half the total SN luminosity. For lower He-star masses, a greater diversity of coolants appear, in particular Fe, S, Ar, or Ni from the Si- and Fe-rich regions. All models tend to rise in ionization in time, with twice-ionized species (i.e., OIII, NeIII, SIII, or FeIII) dominating at ~10yr, although this ionization is significantly reduced if clumping is introduced. Our treatment of magnetar power in the form of high-energy electrons or X-ray irradiation yields similar results -- no X-rays emerge from our ejecta even at ten years because of high-optical depth in the keV range. An uncertainty of our work concerns the power deposition profile, which is not known from first principles, although this profile could be constrained from observations. Our magnetar-powered model he8p00 with moderate clumping yields a good match to the optical and near-infrared observations of Type Ib SN2012au at both ~300d (power of 1-2x10^41erg/s) and 2269d (power of 10^40erg/s). Unless overly ionized, we find that all massive magnetar-powered ejecta should be infrared luminous at 5-10yr through strong [NeII]12.81micron line emission.
