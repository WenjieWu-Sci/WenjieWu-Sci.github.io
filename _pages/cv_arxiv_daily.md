2025-09-09, **Lepton flavor violating decays of Higgs boson in the NB-LSSM**, Cai Guo et.al., [2509.07902v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07902v1)

 Lepton flavor violation (LFV) represents a clear new physics (NP) signal beyond the standard model (SM). NB-LSSM, the next to minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM with local B-L gauge symmetry, includes three Higgs singlets and three generations of right-handed neutrinos in the basis of MSSM, motivated by the new definition of SM-like Higgs resultly from the introducing of three Higgs singlets which mix with the two Higgs doublets at the tree level in the NB-LSSM. We calculate LFV processes $h\rightarrow l\_i l\_j$ in the mass eigenstate basis and the electroweak interaction basis separately, and the latter adopts the mass insertion approximation (MIA) method. In the suitable parameter space, we obtain the reasonable numerical results. At the same time, the corresponding constraints from the LFV rare decays $l\_j\rightarrow l\_i\gamma$ are considered to analyze the numerical results.

2025-09-09, **Oscillation-Independent Probes of Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions from Supernovae**, Angela R. Beatty et.al., [2509.07856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07856v1)

 We introduce the first oscillation-independent astrophysical method to probe non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in core-collapse supernovae. Using a self-consistent treatment of NSI effects in both supernova neutrino emission simulations and flavor independent neutral-current scattering in detectors, we show that anti-correlated coincidence signatures between liquid scintillator experiments such as JUNO and dark matter detectors such as DARWIN/XLZD, ARGO, or RES-NOVA break degeneracy between NSI and flavor conversions effects. For a Galactic supernova within $\lesssim1$ kpc this approach enables independent probes of neutrino-quark NSI couplings in parameter space overlapping and extending beyond existing terrestrial limits. Our results establish a novel oscillation-independent avenue to test fundamental neutrino interactions in extreme astrophysical environments.

2025-09-09, **Measurement of muon neutrino induced charged current interactions without charged pions in the final state using a new T2K off-axis near detector WAGASCI-BabyMIND**, K. Abe et.al., [2509.07814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07814v1)

 We report a flux-integrated cross section measurement of muon neutrino interactions on water and hydrocarbon via charged current reactions without charged pions in the final state with the WAGASCI-BabyMIND detector which was installed in the T2K near detector hall in 2018. The detector is located 1.5$^\circ$ off-axis and is exposed to a more energetic neutrino flux than ND280, another T2K near detector, which is located at a different off-axis position. The total flux-integrated cross section is measured to be $1.26 \pm 0.18\,(stat.+syst.) \times 10^{-39} $ $\mathrm{cm^{2}/nucleon}$ on CH and $1.44 \pm 0.21\,(stat.+syst.) \times 10^{-39} $ $\mathrm{cm^{2}/nucleon}$ on H$\_{2}$O. These results are compared to model predictions provided by the NEUT v5.3.2 and GENIE v2.8.0 MC generators and the measurements are compatible with these models. Differential cross sections in muon momentum and cosine of the muon scattering angle are also reported. This is the first such measurement reported with the WAGASCI-BabyMIND detector and utilizes the 2020 and 2021 datasets.

2025-09-09, **Towards mono-energetic virtual $ν$ beam cross-section measurements: A feasibility study of $ν$-Ar interaction analysis with DUNE-PRISM**, DUNE Collaboration et.al., [2509.07664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07664v1)

 Neutrino-nucleus cross-section measurements are critical for future neutrino oscillation analyses. However, our models to describe them require further refinement, and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is essential for future neutrino oscillation experiments to realize their ambitious physics goals. Current neutrino cross-section measurements provide clear deficiencies in neutrino interaction modeling, but almost all are reported averaged over broad neutrino fluxes, rendering their interpretation challenging. Using the DUNE-PRISM concept (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment Precision Reaction Independent Spectrum Measurement) -- a movable near detector that samples multiple off-axis positions -- neutrino interaction measurements can be used to construct narrow virtual fluxes (less than 100 MeV wide). These fluxes can be used to extract charged-current neutrino-nucleus cross sections as functions of outgoing lepton kinematics within specific neutrino energy ranges. Based on a dedicated simulation with realistic event statistics and flux-related systematic uncertainties, but assuming an almost-perfect detector, we run a feasibility study demonstrating how DUNE-PRISM data can be used to measure muon neutrino charged-current integrated and differential cross sections over narrow fluxes. We find that this approach enables a model independent reconstruction of powerful observables, including energy transfer, typically accessible only in electron scattering measurements, but that large exposures may be required for differential cross-section measurements with few-\% statistical uncertainties.

2025-09-09, **Indirect dark matter searches with neutrino telescopes via energetic cosmic showers**, Arindam Basu et.al., [2509.07570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07570v1)

 We explore the possibility that the high energy neutrino flux observed by terrestrial telescopes originates from dark matter (DM) annihilation. Specifically, we study a minimal, UV-complete $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model with a Dirac DM candidate, whose annihilation into neutrinos proceeds exclusively through a $Z^\prime$ boson. By computing the annihilation cross section and comparing with the observed flux, we derive bounds on the model parameters. Additional constraints are obtained within the freeze-in framework, where the observed relic abundance is reproduced, leading to the strongest bounds. Considering cosmic string vibrations as a source of gravitational waves, we further constrain the vacuum expectation value of the $U(1)$ breaking. All results are contrasted with perturbativity limits and existing constraints from low- and high-energy experiments.

2025-09-08, **Indirect detection of boosted light scalar dark matter**, Arindam Basu et.al., [2509.07110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07110v1)

 We explore the possibilities of detecting MeV-scale boosted dark matter (DM) via astrophysical observations. Given a particular model framework, using gamma-ray data from \texttt{COMPTEL} and \texttt{EGRET}, as well as neutrino constraints from the \texttt{Super-Kamiokande}, \texttt{Hyper-Kamiokande}, \texttt{JUNO}, diffuse supernova neutrino background (\texttt{DSNB}), and atmospheric neutrino observations, we find that boosted light scalar DM could be probed within the mass range of $\sim 20\!-\!80$ MeV, satisfying the Planck observed relic abundance. Our study shows, indirect search can play a key role in the detection of MeV-scale boosted DM, which are otherwise beyond the reach of usual collider or DM scattering experiments.

2025-09-08, **Stochastic modelling of cosmic-ray sources for Galactic diffuse emissions**, Anton Stall et.al., [2509.06857v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06857v1)

 Galactic diffuse emissions in gamma rays and neutrinos arise from interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium and probe the cosmic-ray intensity away from the Solar system. Model predictions for those are influenced by the properties of cosmic-ray sources, and understanding the impact of cosmic-ray sources on Galactic diffuse emissions is key for interpreting measurements by LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube, and the upcoming SWGO. We consider supernova remnants as prototypical cosmic-ray sources and study the impact of their discreteness on the Galactic diffuse emissions in different source injection and near-source transport models in a stochastic Monte Carlo study. Three lessons exemplify the results of our simulations: First, the distributions of Galactic diffuse emission intensities can be described by a mixture model of stable laws and Gaussian distributions. Second, the maximal deviations caused by discrete sources across the sky depend on energy, reaching typically tens of percent in burst-like and energy-dependent escape scenarios but order unity or larger in a time-dependent diffusion scenario. Third, the additional model uncertainty from source stochasticity is subdominant in burst-like and energy-dependent escape scenarios, but becomes sizeable above some tens of TeV in the time-dependent diffusion scenario, where it can help reconcile model predictions with LHAASO measurements. With increased spatial resolution, especially at energies beyond tens of TeV, measurements of Galactic diffuse emissions can be expected to constrain source models and locate cosmic ray sources.

2025-09-08, **Magnetic, thermal and rotational evolution of isolated neutron stars**, José A. Pons et.al., [2509.06699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06699v1)

 The strong magnetic fields of neutron stars are closely linked to their observed thermal, spectral, and timing properties, such as the distribution of spin periods and their derivatives. To understand the evolution of astrophysical observables over time, it is essential to develop robust theoretical frameworks and numerical models that solve the coupled thermal and magnetic field evolution equations, incorporating detailed microphysical inputs like thermal and electrical conductivities and neutrino emission rates. These efforts are key to uncovering how the strength and geometry of magnetic fields change with age, ultimately shedding light on the diverse phenomenology of neutron stars. In this review, we outline the fundamental theory underlying magneto-thermal evolution models, with an emphasis on numerical methods and a comprehensive set of benchmark tests intended to guide current and future code development. We revisit established results from axisymmetric simulations, highlight recent progress in fully three-dimensional models, and offer a perspective on the anticipated developments in this rapidly evolving field.

2025-09-08, **Transient Observations with LST-1: Key Results and Future Prospects**, Monica Seglar-Arroyo et.al., [2509.06668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06668v1)

 The recent detections of the afterglow phase of long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) at very high energies (VHE, >100 GeV) mark a significant advance in astrophysics of transient phenomena, offering deeper insights into the acceleration mechanisms, jet structure, and physical processes driving GRB emission. In the multi-messenger landscape, both high-energy neutrino and gravitational wave detections are providing new insights into the physics of extreme cosmic accelerators and highlighting the need for rapid and broadband follow-up observations. The Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1), the first telescope of the LST array, part of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) North site, is particularly well-suited for real-time, rapid follow-up of transients. In this contribution, we present the latest achievements of the transient observational program with LST-1, which is now in advanced commissioning on La Palma, Canary Islands. We outline the observational strategies in place and describe the dynamic handling of events by the transient handler of LST-1 (e.g., its ability to handle poorly localised events, including gravitational waves, GRBs and neutrinos). We present the key results from transient observation campaigns conducted so far, discuss the lessons learned, and outline the promising prospects for the future LST-1+MAGIC combined transient program with fast response, via a Transient Handler.

2025-09-09, **LHAASO Galactic Plane $γ$-rays Strongly Constrain Heavy Dark Matter**, Celine Boehm et.al., [2509.07982v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07982v1)

 LHAASO, a ground-based observatory, is unveiling new frontiers in our understanding of high-energy $\gamma-$rays and cosmic rays. It has recently observed high energy diffuse $\gamma-$rays from the Galactic plane in the TeV-PeV range. For the first time, we analyze this data to search for signatures of heavy decaying and annihilating dark matter in the mass range $10^{5}-10^{11}$ GeV. We compute the expected photon flux from both Galactic and extragalactic dark matter, incorporating attenuation due to photon pair production. For the Galactic contribution, we include both prompt photons and secondary photons produced via inverse Compton scattering, accounting for electron/positron propagation. For the extragalactic component, in addition to the prompt and inverse Compton contributions, we also include cascade photons arising from inverse Compton scattering of pair-produced electrons and positrons. By combining all these contributions, we derive constraints on the dark matter parameter space. Our bounds for various two body Standard Model final states are strongest to date. This underscore LHAASO's capability to discover the nature of heavy dark matter.

2025-09-09, **A dense dark matter core of the subhalo in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666**, Lei Lei et.al., [2509.07808v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07808v1)

 The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m\_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}\_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r\_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho\_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M\_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.

2025-09-09, **A comprehensive separation of dark matter and baryonic mass components in galaxy clusters II: an overview of the mass distribution in Abell S1063**, Benjamin Beauchesne et.al., [2509.07777v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07777v1)

 In the first paper of this series, we derived mass constraints on the total mass and the baryonic components of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063. The main focus was to recover stellar masses and kinematics for cluster members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). In this second paper, we introduce a multi-probe mass modelling approach that incorporates constraints on both the total mass and the individual baryonic components. We obtain comprehensive mass models of Abell S1063, in which the dark matter distribution is disentangled from the baryonic mass at both cluster and galaxy scales. The best-fitting mass model achieves an RMS of $0.50"$ on the multiple image positions. The kinematic profiles of the BCG \& ICL, as well as the X-ray surface brightness of the intra-cluster gas, are accurately reproduced within observational uncertainties. However, a $35~\mathrm{km/s}$ scatter is required for the cluster member line-of-sight dispersions. This method yields the most complex parametric mass model with consistency among almost all available mass constraints. We find a $1\sigma$ agreement between the inferred stellar-to-subhalo mass relation and that predicted by large-scale cosmological simulations. The ICL stellar mass derived from our model is consistent with estimates from stellar population modelling. We present the first multi-probe mass modelling method capable of disentangling the dark matter from the baryonic mass distributions in massive galaxy clusters. Its results, such as the stellar-to-subhalo mass relation or the distribution of each mass component, can be directly compared to hydrodynamical cosmological simulations such as illustrisTNG.

2025-09-09, **Illuminating dark matter admixed in neutron stars with simultaneous mass-radius constraints**, Nai-Bo Zhang et.al., [2509.07767v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07767v1)

 We investigate how simultaneous mass and radius measurements of massive neutron stars (NSs) can help constrain properties of dark matter (DM) possibly admixed in them. Within a fermionic DM model that interacts only through gravitation, along with a well-constrained nuclear matter equation of state, we show that the simultaneous mass and radius measurement of PSRJ0740+6620 reduces the uncertainty of DM central energy density by more than 50\% compared to the results obtained from using the two observables independently, while other DM parameters remain unconstrained. Additionally, we find that the DM fraction $f\_D$ should be smaller than 2\% when constrained by the observed NS maximum mass alone, and it could be even smaller than 0.3\% with the simultaneous measurement of mass and radius, supporting the conclusion that only a small amount of DM exists in DM admixed neutron stars (DANS).

2025-09-09, **A comprehensive separation of dark matter and baryonic mass components in galaxy clusters I: Mass constraints from Abell S1063**, Benjamin Beauchesne et.al., [2509.07762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07762v1)

 In this two-part series, we present a multi-probe mass modelling method for massive galaxy clusters, designed to disentangle the contributions of individual mass components (Dark matter, intra-cluster gas, stellar masses). In this first paper, we focus on recovering the mass constraint datasets required for the modelling approach introduced in the second paper. Specifically, we measure the light distribution, stellar mass, and kinematics of the cluster members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the intra-cluster light (ICL) in Abell S1063. To that end, we developed a new method to extract the light profiles of the cluster members, BCG, and ICL, while accounting for contamination from nearby foreground and background galaxies in \textsc{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) imaging. We obtained light profiles for $289$ cluster members using a dual Pseudo-Isothermal Elliptical (dPIE) model based on the HST F160W filter, while the BCG \& ICL is modelled as a single component using a multi-Gaussian expansion. To estimate stellar masses and velocity dispersions, we rely on multi-band HST photometry and \textsc{VLT/MUSE} integral field spectroscopy, respectively. Stellar masses are derived using three different spectral energy distribution (SED) models. We measure the line-of-sight velocity dispersions of the cluster members at their half-light radii, as determined from their light profiles, while for the BCG \& ICL components, we use elliptical annular apertures. Thanks to these measurements, we will be able to constrain the cluster stellar mass content, which is detailed in the second paper of the series. We publicly release these measurements with intermediary data products.

2025-09-09, **Cosmological simulations of the same spiral galaxy: satellite properties, the role of baryonic physics and star formation history in shaping dark matter cores/cusps**, A. Nuñez-Castiñeyra et.al., [2509.07470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07470v1)

 We investigate the role of baryonic physics in shaping the population, structure, and internal dynamics of galactic subhalos using the Mochima suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. A refined method is developed to identify bound subhalo material by isolating the local gravitational potential and applying multi-criteria phase-space selection. This approach enables a robust characterisation of subhalo properties across five baryonic runs with varying prescriptions for star formation, and supernova and protostellar feedback, as well as a dark matter-only baseline. At the population level, we find that host halo concentration, modulated by baryonic feedback, is a key predictor of subhalo survival. Subhalos with more massive stellar components exhibit deeper internal potentials and enhanced resilience to tidal disruption. At the structural level, we identify a broad diversity in inner dark matter profiles, consistent with observations of dwarf galaxies. We show that this diversity correlates with both star formation history and environmental interaction. In particular, galaxies that form most of their stars early tend to retain steep cusps, while those with extended or recent star formation exhibit oscillating inner slopes shaped by bursty feedback and tidal perturbations. These findings suggest that the so-called "diversity problem" may reflect the complex interplay between feedback history and gravitational environment, rather than a breakdown of cold dark matter predictions.

2025-09-08, **Setting Limits on Blazar-Boosted Dark Matter with Xenon-based Detectors**, Erin Barillier et.al., [2509.07265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07265v1)

 Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity for dark matter in the $10$--$1000~\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass range, but sub-GeV dark matter particles lack sufficient energy to produce nuclear recoils above detection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter offers a way to overcome this limitation: relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies capable of producing detectable nuclear recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark matter search incorporating detector response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS~0506+056. We model dark matter--proton scattering in the jet environment, covering the full process from jet acceleration to detector response. We explore how the host-galaxy dark matter density profile impacts our analysis. Using XENON1T data, we exclude dark matter--nucleon cross sections for $m\_\chi \sim 1~\mathrm{MeV}$ in the range $5.8\times 10^{-31}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma\_{\chi n} \lesssim 6.3\times 10^{-29}~\mathrm{cm^2}$, and using LZ EFT searches we constrain $9.9\times 10^{-32}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma\_{\chi n} \lesssim 2.5\times 10^{-28}~\mathrm{cm^2}$. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties, especially the dark matter density profile near the supermassive black hole, set the primary limitation on the sensitivity rather than detector systematics. These findings highlight blazar-boosted dark matter as a promising probe of light dark matter and motivate further astrophysical modeling.

2025-09-08, **Morphological characteristics of protohalos and their connection to halo formation histories**, Farnik Nikakhtar et.al., [2509.07153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07153v1)

 Protohalos, primordial regions in the initial cosmic density field that evolve into dark matter halos, are crucial for understanding cosmic structure formation. Motivated by the potential to reconstruct protohalo positions and shapes from observed galaxies using a novel approach grounded in optimal transport theory, we revisit the relationship between the structural properties of protohalos and the formation histories, concentrations, and final morphologies of their associated dark matter halos. To better understand halo assembly, we introduce a new estimator defined by an integral over redshifts and compare its performance to $z\_{50}$, the commonly used redshift at which half of the final halo mass is formed. We quantify protohalo structure using the three invariants of the inertia, deformation, and energy shear tensors. Although past research has correlated the first two invariants of the deformation and energy tensors with halo formation, our findings reveal that the third invariant also significantly correlates with the final halo shape. We discuss the prospect of using optimal transport to connect our protohalo results to observations of high-redshift protoclusters to better align theoretical models with observational data.

2025-09-08, **NLO observables for QCD-like theories and application to pion dark matter**, Helena Kolešová et.al., [2509.07102v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07102v1)

 QCD-like theories are of interest in various areas of beyond-Standard-Model phenomenology, including composite Higgs models or pionic dark matter. The effective field theories provide a framework for describing the dynamics of such strongly coupled gauge theories at low energies. In this work, we present next-to-leading order (NLO) expressions for masses, condensates, decay constants, and scattering amplitudes in the chiral expansion of QCD-like theories with $N\_F=2$ fermions with non-degenerate masses in both real and pseudoreal representations of the gauge group. We further apply the NLO formulas to fit existing lattice spectroscopic and scattering data for $Sp(N\_c=4)$ gauge theory with $N\_F=2$ fermions in fundamental representation, extracting the NLO low-energy constants of the theory. Using these fits, we refine the NLO formulas describing the $2\to 2$ pion self-interactions and confirm that the NLO contributions play a crucial role in determining the viable parameter space of pion dark matter scenarios like the strongly interacting massive particles (SIMP).

2025-09-08, **Why Cosmic Voids Matter: Pristine Evolution**, Nico Schuster et.al., [2509.07092v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07092v1)

 We utilize the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation and evolution of cosmic voids from $z = 5.04$ to present day, using cold dark matter and (sub-) halo tracers in high-density samples. This includes the evolution of their global properties, such as size, shape, inner density, and average density, as well as their radial density profiles. Our results provide several key conclusions for void analyses in modern surveys. We demonstrate that a relative size framework is required, mitigating methodological selection effects and revealing the true physical evolution of densities around halo-defined voids. This necessity arises from our findings that a void's properties are more fundamentally tied to its rank within its contemporary population than to its absolute size. Using this framework, we show that the evolution of halo voids stabilizes at redshifts below $z \simeq 1$, driven primarily by cosmic expansion rather than ongoing halo formation. We further find that the matter evolution around these stable voids is remarkably well-described by linear growth theory, with deviations appearing as non-linear growth on small scales and suppressed growth in the largest voids, potentially driven by the influence of dark energy. This late-time stability and the predictable evolution confirm voids as pristine laboratories for probing the nature of dark energy with upcoming surveys.

2025-09-08, **Numerical effects on the stripping of dark matter and stars in IllustrisTNG galaxy groups and clusters**, Mark R. Lovell et.al., [2509.07078v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07078v1)

 The stellar haloes and intra-cluster light around galaxies are crucial test beds for dark matter (DM) physics and galaxy formation models. We consider the role that the numerical resolution plays in the modelling of these systems by studying the stripping of satellites in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We focus on host haloes of total halo mass $M\_\mathrm{200c}=10^{12-15}M\_{\odot}$ and satellites of stellar mass $>10^{7}$$M\_{\odot}$, and compare stellar halo / satellite properties across 9 IllustrisTNG runs with baryonic particle mass resolution between $8.5\times10^4M\_{\odot}$ and $7\times10^8$$M\_{\odot}$, using a Lagrangian-region technique to identify counterpart satellites across different resolution simulations of the same volume. We publish the corresponding catalogues alongside this paper. We demonstrate that the stripping of DM from satellites that orbit in group- and cluster-mass hosts is largely independent of resolution at least until 90 per cent of their initial mass at infall has been stripped. We do not find evidence for spurious disruption of galaxies due to insufficient resolution for the satellite masses we consider. By contrast, the stripping of stellar mass is strongly resolution-dependent: each factor of 8 improvement in particle stellar mass typically adds 2~Gyr to the stripping time. Improved numerical resolution within the IllustrisTNG model generally results in more compact satellites with larger stellar masses, which in turn generate more centrally concentrated stellar haloes and intra-cluster mass profiles. However, the concomitant increase in stellar mass of both satellites and hosts may still be the cause for the overprediction of the stellar halo mass at large host radii relative to observations seen in some previous studies.

2025-09-08, **Reviving WIMP dark matter with temperature-dependent couplings**, Debasish Borah et.al., [2509.07070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07070v1)

 The persistent null results at dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments have pushed the popular weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) DM to tight corners. Generic WIMP models with direct detection rate below the current upper limits often lead to thermally overproduced relic abundance after freeze-out. To resolve this conundrum, we propose a novel scenario where DM has temperature-dependent couplings with the standard model (SM) bath. A scalar field having a large vacuum expectation value (VEV) at high temperatures generates sizeable DM-SM interactions leading to efficient DM annihilations responsible for generating the desired thermal relic. At lower temperatures, the scalar field VEV settles down to a small value as a result of a first-order phase transition (FOPT), effectively leading to suppressed DM-SM interaction rate at low temperature, consistent with null results at direct detection experiments. Upper bound on thermal DM mass forces the FOPT to occur at scales such that the corresponding gravitational wave signal remains within reach of future experiments like LISA.

2025-09-08, **Constraints on Dark Matter Models from Supermassive Black Hole Evolution**, John Ellis et.al., [2509.06955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06955v1)

 A semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm has been shown to yield stellar mass-BH mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. Either fuzzy or warm dark matter (FDM or WDM) would suppress the formation of the smaller galactic halos that play important roles in the CDM fit to the high-redshift SMBH data. Our analysis of the stellar mass-BH mass relation disfavours FDM fields with masses $< 2.0\times 10^{-20}$ eV and WDM particles with masses $< 7.2$ keV, both at the 95 % confidence level.

2025-09-08, **First Production of Skipper-CCD Modules for the DAMIC-M Experiment**, H. Lin et.al., [2509.06943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06943v1)

 The DAMIC-M experiment will search for sub-GeV dark matter particles with a large array of silicon skipper charge-coupled devices (CCDs) at the Modane Underground Laboratory (LSM) in France. After five years of development, we recently completed the production of 28 CCD modules at the University of Washington, each consisting of four 9-megapixel skipper CCDs. Material screening and background controls were implemented to meet stringent radio-purity targets, while extensive testing was employed to select science-grade CCDs for the modules and confirm their excellent performance after fabrication. Further testing at LSM will select 26 of these modules (${\sim}$350 g active mass) to be installed and operated in the DAMIC-M detector in early 2026.

2025-09-08, **Asymmetric Cannibal Dark Matter: Constraints from Neutron Star**, Ujjal Kumar Dey et.al., [2509.06892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06892v1)

 Asymmetric dark matter can be efficiently captured by neutron stars via elastic scattering with nucleons and dark matter self scattering. The accumulated dark matter thermalizes and concentrates in the stellar interior, forming a dark matter core. In this work, we propose a novel framework in which a $\mathbb{Z}\_3$ symmetry allows for number-changing self-interactions of the form $3 \rightarrow 2$ within the dark sector. These cannibalistic reactions become increasingly efficient at high dark matter densities, leading to a significant depletion of the dark matter population in the stellar core. This number depletion heats up the neutron star above the standard cooling expectations, yielding observable thermal signatures in relatively old, isolated neutron stars, potentially detectable via James Webb Space Telescope. We show that even in the presence of other heating mechanisms, e.g. dark matter annihilation and kinetic heating, the cannibal heating dominates for certain parameter space. We demonstrate that the cannibal heating can predict detectable heating signatures in old neutron stars, thereby allowing a broader range of viable dark matter masses and couplings to the Standard Model.

2025-09-08, **Euclid preparation. Methodology for validating the Euclid Catalogue of Galaxy Clusters using external data**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2509.06805v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06805v1)

 We present our methodology for identifying known clusters as counterparts to objects in the Euclid Catalogue of Galaxy Clusters (ECGC). Euclid is expected to detect a large number of optically-selected galaxy clusters over the approximately 14000 square degrees of its extragalactic sky survey. Extending out well beyond redshift unity, the catalogue will contain many new high-redshift clusters, while at lower redshifts a fraction of the clusters will have been observed in other surveys. Identifying these known clusters as counterparts to the Euclid-detected clusters is an important step in the validation and construction of the ECGC to augment information with external observables. We present a set of catalogues and meta-catalogues of known clusters that we have assembled for this step, and we illustrate their application and our methodology using the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 RedMaPPer cluster catalogue in lieu of the future ECGC. In the process of this work, we have constructed and deliver an updated EC-RedMaPPer catalogue with multi-wavelength counterparts.

 Convolutional neural networks have shown their ability to differentiate between self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) on galaxy cluster scales. However, their large parameter counts and ''black-box'' nature make it difficult to assess whether their decisions adhere to physical principles. To address this issue, we have built a Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN) that reduces parameter count and enhances interpretability, and propose a novel analytical framework to understand the network's decision-making process. With this framework, we leverage our network to qualitatively assess the offset between the dark matter distribution center and the galaxy cluster center, as well as the size of heating regions in different models. These findings are consistent with current theoretical predictions and show the reliability and interpretability of our network. By combining network interpretability with unseen test results, we also estimate that for SIDM in galaxy clusters, the minimum cross-section $(\sigma/m)\_{\mathrm{th}}$ required to reliably identify its collisional nature falls between $0.1\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$ and $0.3\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$. Moreover, CKAN maintains robust performance under simulated JWST and Euclid noise, highlighting its promise for application to forthcoming observational surveys.

 We present a new model for two-component scalar dark matter (DM), consisting of two complex scalar fields. In this model, both the DM components are stable due to the remaining $Z\_4$ gauge symmetry, which is the remnant of the $U(1)^\prime$ local symmetry. When the resonance condition for DM masses is fulfilled, we show that the elastic co-scattering processes between two components of dark matter ($u$-channel processes) are enhanced due to the Yukawa potential with a small effective mass for the lighter DM mediator, so we can use such co-scattering processes for dark matter to explain the small-scale problems at galaxies. Moreover, there are also semi-annihilation processes that two components of dark matter annihilate into one dark matter particle and a dark photon/Higgs, which are enhanced by the $u$-channel Sommerfeld factor. Focusing on some benchmark models for two-component dark matter satisfying the observed relic density, we obtain the bounds for the dark photon portal couplings from the direct detection for boosted dark matter, which is produced from the semi-annihilation processes at the galactic center.

 For the first time, we explore dark matter (DM) admixed quarkyonic stars (DAQSs) within a two-fluid formalism, where the normal/visible sector is modeled by a quarkyonic equation of state (EOS) in the Effective Relativistic Mean Field (E-RMF) framework and the DM component is treated as a degenerate fermionic gas with scalar and vector self-interactions. Our analysis begins with the mass-radius (M-R) relation, showing that the inclusion of DM enables stellar configurations to reach the mass range compatible with the GW190814 event. We identify both DM core and DM halo morphologies among the viable EOSs, with core dominated and halo dominated cases exhibiting distinct signatures. By fixing the stellar mass within the GW190814 range, we constrain the possible dark matter fractions and explore the role of different interaction channels. Using the EOSs consistent with these constraints, we further investigate the tidal deformability ($\Lambda$), moment of inertia (MOI), and stellar radius, finding broad agreement with constraints from GW170817, GW190814, and NICER. Finally, we compile the characteristic properties of DAQSs, including EOS type, DM fractions, morphology (core vs halo), and macroscopic observables in a comparative summary. This study provides a unified two-fluid framework to explore dense QCD matter and dark matter in the multi-messenger era, suggesting that the GW190814 secondary object could plausibly be interpreted as either a DM core or a DM halo quarkyonic star.

 This paper explores the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory to dark matter annihilation in the Galactic Center, within the frameworks of Effective Field Theory and Simplified Models. We present sensitivity forecasts, utilizing an up-to-date instrument configuration and incorporating the latest models for Galactic Diffuse Emission. A key aspect of our work is the inclusion of updated dark matter density profiles, J-factors, and velocity dispersion distributions derived from the FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which significantly impact the expected indirect detection signals. Furthermore, we update the constraints from direct detection experiments (Xenon1T and LZ) taking into account the astrophysical uncertainties informed by the FIRE-2 simulations, and also investigate limits coming from collider searches (ATLAS and CMS). Our analysis reveals improved constraints on the effective suppression scale ($M\_*$) in the Effective Field Theory framework and on the mediator mass ($M\_{med}$) in Simplified Models compared to previous studies, highlighting the complementarity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory with direct and collider searches in probing a wide range of dark matter scenarios. We discuss the implications of these results for various dark matter interaction types, including scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector mediators, and emphasize the importance of considering realistic astrophysical inputs in interpreting dark matter search results across different experimental fronts.

 The MAgnetized Disk and Mirror Axion eXperiment (MADMAX) is a future experiment aiming to detect dark matter axions from the galactic halo by resonant conversion to photons in a strong magnetic field. It uses a novel concept based on a stack of dielectric disks in front of a mirror, called booster, to enhance the potential signal from axion-photon conversion over a significant mass range. In its final version, MADMAX aims to scan the uncharted QCD axion mass range around 100 $\mu$eV, favored by post-inflationary theories. Several small scale prototype systems have been tested these last three years, allowing to validate the dielectric haloscope concept and perform competitive axion and dark photon dark matter searches. This contribution presents the current status of the experiment and its prototypes, including the results achieved so far, the ongoing research and development and the remaining challenges.

 We discuss the implications of the most recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) DR2 and DESyr5 compilation of supernovae (SNe) datasets for modified gravity focusing on non-metricity based $f(Q)$ theory, by employing a `model-independent' approach. We reconstruct of dark energy density which is then extended to estimate the perturbation-level quantities, sourced by the modified gravity, namely the effective gravitational coupling, $\mu$, and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave propagation, $\nu$. In light of the remarkable hints for a dynamical dark energy emerging from the analysis of background cosmological data, we discuss the possibility to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity scenarios from their scalar and tensor perturbation-level signatures. We contrast our findings between the older Pantheon+ and the newer DESyr5 compilations of SNe datasets, which predict a significant distinct signature in the damping parameter of the gravitational wave propagation amplitude. On the other hand, the prediction for the effective gravitational coupling remains insensitive to the choice of the SNe datasets. Our results provide a strong case for the study of gravitational wave propagation in modified gravity theories, in light of the new generation of gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.

 The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector that will observe in the decihertz (dHz) frequency region. In this band, binary white dwarf systems are expected to merge, emitting gravitational waves. Detecting this emission opens new perspectives for understanding the Type Ia supernova progenitors and for investigating dense matter physics. In this work, we present the capabilities of LGWA to detect and localize short-period double white dwarfs in terms of sky locations and distances. The analysis is performed using a realistic spatial distribution of sources, merger rates, and binary-mass distributions derived from current population synthesis models. The simulated population of double white dwarfs is generated using the SeBa stellar-evolution code, coupled with dedicated sampling algorithms. The performance of the LGWA detector, both in terms of signal detectability and parameter estimation, is assessed using standard gravitational-wave data analysis techniques, including Fisher matrix methods, as implemented in the GWFish and Legwork codes. The analysis indicates that LGWA could detect approximately O(30) monochromatic galactic sources and O(10) extragalactic mergers, demonstrating the unique potential of decihertz gravitational-wave detectors to access and characterize extragalactic DWD populations. This will open new avenues for understanding Type Ia supernova progenitors and the physics of DWDs.

 We test the validity of the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by combining angular diameter distance and luminosity distance measurements from recent cosmological observations. For the angular diameter distance, we use data from transverse baryon acoustic oscillations and galaxy clusters. On the other hand, the luminosity distance is obtained from Type Ia supernovae in the Pantheon+ sample and from quasar catalogs. To reduce the large dispersion in quasar luminosity distances, we apply a selection criterion based on their deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model and implement a binning procedure to suppress statistical noise. We reconstruct the CDDR using Gaussian Processes, a non-parametric supervised machine learning method. Our results show no significant deviation from the CDDR within the $2\sigma$ confidence level across the redshift range explored, supporting its validity even at high redshifts.

 We present a detailed analysis of type Iax supernova SN 2022xlp. With a V-band absolute magnitude light curve peaking at $M\_{max}(V) = -16.04 \pm 0.25$ mag, this object is regarded as the second determined well-observed Iax supernova in the intermediate luminosity range after SN 2019muj. Our research aims to explore the question of whether the physical properties vary continuously across the entire luminosity range. We also investigate the chemical abundance profiles and the characteristic physical quantities of the ejecta, followed by tests of the predictions of hydro simulations. The pseudo-bolometric light curve was calculated using optical and UV (Swift UVOT ) light curves and fits with a radiation diffusion Arnett model to constrain the average optical opacity, ejected mass, and initial nickel mass produced in the explosion. We analyzed the color evolution of SN 2022xlp and compared it with that of other Iax supernovae with different peak luminosities. We used the spectral tomography method to determine the radial profiles of physical properties and abundances of the ejecta, comparing them with a set of hydrodynamic pure deflagration models. The estimated bolometric flux peaks at $8.87\times 10^{41}$ erg/s and indicates the production of radioactive nickel as $M(^{56}$Ni) = $0.0215 \pm 0.009\,M\_{\odot}$. According to the best-fit model, the explosion energy is $(2.066 \pm 0.236) \times 10^{49}$ erg and the ejecta mass is $0.142 \pm 0.015\,M\_{\odot}$. The performed spectral tomography analysis shows that the determined physical quantities agree well with the predictions of the deflagration simulations, with modifications regarding the increased Na abundance and the more massive outer layers. SN 2022xlp bridges the previously existing luminosity gap, and supports the assumption of continuous variation in the physical properties across the SN Iax subclass.

2025-09-09, **Cosmological simulations of the same spiral galaxy: satellite properties, the role of baryonic physics and star formation history in shaping dark matter cores/cusps**, A. Nuñez-Castiñeyra et.al., [2509.07470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07470v1)

 We investigate the role of baryonic physics in shaping the population, structure, and internal dynamics of galactic subhalos using the Mochima suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. A refined method is developed to identify bound subhalo material by isolating the local gravitational potential and applying multi-criteria phase-space selection. This approach enables a robust characterisation of subhalo properties across five baryonic runs with varying prescriptions for star formation, and supernova and protostellar feedback, as well as a dark matter-only baseline. At the population level, we find that host halo concentration, modulated by baryonic feedback, is a key predictor of subhalo survival. Subhalos with more massive stellar components exhibit deeper internal potentials and enhanced resilience to tidal disruption. At the structural level, we identify a broad diversity in inner dark matter profiles, consistent with observations of dwarf galaxies. We show that this diversity correlates with both star formation history and environmental interaction. In particular, galaxies that form most of their stars early tend to retain steep cusps, while those with extended or recent star formation exhibit oscillating inner slopes shaped by bursty feedback and tidal perturbations. These findings suggest that the so-called "diversity problem" may reflect the complex interplay between feedback history and gravitational environment, rather than a breakdown of cold dark matter predictions.

2025-09-09, **Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities**, James R. Beattie et.al., [2509.07354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07354v1)

 The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SNe-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that SNRs radiate incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation, localized at the interface where the hot and warm plasma phases mix near the cooling radius. I provide evidence that this process is seeded by a Vishniac (1994)-type instability, which corrugates and folds the interface. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism described and measured in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $\propto k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable SNR layer, can imprint itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale instabilities in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.

2025-09-08, **Carnegie Supernova Project: Fast-Declining Type Ia Supernovae as Cosmological Distance Indicators**, M. M. Phillips et.al., [2509.07093v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07093v1)

 In this paper, the suitability of fast-declining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological standard candles is examined utilizing a Hubble Flow sample of 43 of these objects observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). We confirm previous suggestions that fast-declining SNe Ia offer a viable method for estimating distances to early-type galaxies when the color-stretch parameter, $s\_{BV}$, is used as a measure of the light curve shape. As a test, we employ the Tripp (1998) method, which models the absolute magnitude at maximum as a function of light curve shape and color. We calibrate the sample using 12 distance moduli based on published Infrared Surface Brightness Fluctuations to derive a value of the Hubble constant that is in close agreement with the value found by Uddin et al. (2024), using the same methodology, but with the full sample of CSP SNe Ia. We also develop a new and simple method of estimating the distances of fast decliners only based on their colors at maximum (and not light curve shape) and find that it has a precision similar to the Tripp method. This "Color" technique is a powerful tool that is unique to fast-declining SNe Ia. We show that the colors of the fast decliners at maximum light are strongly affected by photospheric temperature differences and not solely due to dust extinction, and provide a physical rationale for this effect.

2025-09-08, **The first radio view of a type Ibn supernova in SN 2023fyq: Understanding the mass-loss history in the last decade before the explosion**, Raphael Baer-Way et.al., [2509.07080v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07080v1)

 Supernovae that interact with hydrogen-poor, helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM), known as Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn), present a unique opportunity to probe mass-loss processes in massive stars. In this work, we report the first radio detection of a SN Ibn, SN 2023fyq, and characterize the mass-loss history of its stellar progenitor using the radio and X-ray observations obtained over 18 months post-explosion. We find that the radio emission from 58--185 days is best modeled by synchrotron radiation attenuated by free-free absorption from a CSM of density $\sim$ $10^{-18}$ g/$\rm{cm^{3}}$ ($\sim 10^{6} \mathrm{\rho\_{ISM}}$) at a radius of $10^{16}$ cm, corresponding to a mass-loss rate of $\sim$ $4 \times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M\_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$ (for a wind velocity of 1700 km/s from optical spectroscopy) from 0.7 to 3 years before the explosion. This timescale is consistent with the time frame over which pre-explosion optical outbursts were observed. However, our late-time observations at 525 days post-explosion yield non-detections, and the 3$\sigma$ upper limits (along with an X-ray non-detection) allow us to infer lower-density CSM at $2\times 10^{16}$ cm with $\rm{\dot{M}}$ $< 2.5\times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M\_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. These results suggest a shell-like CSM from at most $4 \times 10^{15}$ to $2 \times 10^{16}$ cm ($\sim 10^{5} R\_{\rm{\odot}}$) with an elevated CSM density (0.004 $\mathrm{M\_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$) that is roughly consistent with predictions from a merger model for this object. Future radio observations of a larger sample of SNe Ibn will provide key details on the extent and density of their helium-rich CSM.

2025-09-08, **Micro-Tidal Disruption Events in Young Star Clusters**, Sara Rastello et.al., [2509.07067v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07067v1)

 Dense young star clusters (YSCs) are ideal environments for dynamical interactions between stars and stellar mass black holes (BHs). In such dense environments, stars can undergo close encounters with BHs and fall within their tidal radius, resulting in micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs), transient phenomena with potential multi-messenger signatures. We performed a suite of direct N-body simulations using the PETAR code, to which we implemented new prescriptions for modeling micro-TDEs. We constructed a set of realistic YSC models including primordial binaries, based on the observed Milky Way population. Our simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution, supernova kicks, and stellar winds using the BSE code, and account for the Galactic tidal field via the GALPY library. We identify three dynamical channels for micro-TDE production: single star-single BH encounters, binary-mediated interactions (including supernova-kick triggers), and interactions involving higher-order multiple systems such as hierarchical triples and quadruples, as well as chaotic few-body interactions. Multiple encounters are the most efficient production channel, which dominates the total rate: 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs from YSCs are expected to be detectable by upcoming surveys, particularly the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, with detection rates potentially up to hundreds per year. The gravitational wave (GW) signals expected from micro-TDEs peak in the deci-Hertz band, making them accessible to future instruments such as the Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna and the Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Micro-TDEs emerge as promising multi-messenger sources, potentially offering unique insights into star cluster dynamics, stellar collisions, and the population of dormant stellar-mass BHs, through both electromagnetic and GW observations.

2025-09-08, **A galactic tug-of-war: how (not) to simultaneously fit the Milky Way satellite luminosity function and the mass-metallicity relation**, Sownak Bose et.al., [2509.07066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07066v1)

 The satellite population of the Milky Way is shaped by a range of astrophysical processes including mergers, star formation, feedback, and cosmic reionisation. Determining which processes most strongly influence its properties is challenging and a key test of galaxy formation models. We train a neural network on the GALFORM semi-analytic model and apply a variance-based sensitivity analysis to characterise the influence of 11 astrophysical parameters on two key observables: the satellite luminosity function, and the mass-metallicity relation. We find that: (1) the abundance of bright satellites ($\mathrm{M}\_V \lesssim -13$) is regulated primarily by supernova feedback; (2) the faint end of the luminosity function is shaped by the interplay between feedback and reionisation; and (3) the mass-metallicity relation is governed almost exclusively by feedback at all masses. We are unable to find a combination of parameters in the fiducial model that fits the observed data for both statistics simultaneously. To understand why, we employ SHapley Additive exPlanations to capture the directionality of each parameter variation. This enables us to pinpoint the origin of tensions in the model, showing that parameter adjustments that regulate the abundance of faint satellites drive stellar metallicities to be an order of magnitude too low and vice versa. This internal "tug-of-war" leads us to consider extensions to the baseline model, such as metal loading in winds, or allowing the feedback strength to evolve with redshift. Our study highlights the value of interrogating complex physical models through a sensitivity analysis framework by revealing high-order parameter interactions and non-linear responses that traditional one-at-a-time variations would miss.

2025-09-08, **Detection of a septuple stellar system in formation via disk fragmentation**, Shanghuo Li et.al., [2509.06787v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06787v1)

 Stellar multiple systems play a pivotal role in cluster dynamics and stellar evolution, leading to intense astronomical phenomena like X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernova, and stellar mergers, which are prime sources of gravitational waves. However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC\,6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2--3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.

2025-09-08, **Metallicity differences between Type IIP and stripped-envelope supernova environments**, R. Ganss et.al., [2509.06526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06526v1)

 This work presents measurements of local HII environment metallicities of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) in hosts with redshifts up to z$\sim$0.025. 139 SNe environments were observed at the Isaac Newton Telescope and data of an additional 268 SNe environments were found in archival data of MUSE, MaNGA and PISCO. The project focuses on SNe with clean Type IIP, Type Ib and Type Ic classifications. We present the largest spectroscopic sample to date, evaluating environment metallicities of 79 Type Ib, 66 Type Ic and 93 Type IIP by N2 and O3N2 strong emission line methods. The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the SN environment metallicities show Type Ib and Type Ic SNe tending towards higher metallicity than Type IIP. We test the null hypothesis that Type Ib/Ic/IIP progenitors are drawn from the same parent population. There is no statistically significant difference between progenitors of Type Ib and Type Ic SNe. However, when comparing Ib/Ic with IIP SNe, the tests indicate strong statistical significance (significance level better than 1\%) to reject our null hypothesis suggesting that the samples are not drawn from the same parent population. The significance is even higher (level better 0.1\%) when testing Type IIP vs. the combined Type Ib+Ic sample. These results support a different physical nature of Type IIP and Types Ib/Ic progenitors. It challenges stellar evolution and SNe explosion models to reproduce the distinct CDFs found.
