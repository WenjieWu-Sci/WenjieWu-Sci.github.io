2025-10-14, **Measurement of the tau anomalous magnetic moment using Ultra-peripheral collisions with the ALICE detector in Run 3 Pb-Pb data**, Roman Lavička et.al., [2510.12661v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12661v1)

 The anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton ($a\_{\tau}$) is a sensitive probe for the search for deviations from the Standard Model predictions and thus for new physics. This study investigates the feasibility of measuring $a\_{\tau}$ using ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) at the LHC, where photon-photon interactions ($\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+ \tau^-$) produce tau lepton pairs. We focus on events recorded by the ALICE detector during Run 3 Pb-Pb data-taking. Events are selected in the decay channel where one tau decays into an electron and neutrinos, and the other decays into a charged pion, or three charged pions, and neutrinos. These samples are enhanced with decays into muons, which are inseparable in the ALICE detector. The clean environment of UPCs minimizes hadronic background, while the advanced particle identification capabilities of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and Time-of-Flight (TOF) systems allow for efficient separation of electrons, pions, and background particles. In this talk, prospects for measuring this process by ALICE in Run 3, which benefits from high statistics and improved systematics uncertainties, will be discussed. Results will provide tighter constraints on $a\_{\tau}$, contributing to the broader effort to test the Standard Model's robustness and explore physics beyond it.

2025-10-14, **High-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts, but no neutrinos**, A. De Rújula et.al., [2510.12634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12634v1)

 The Cannon-Ball model of Gamma-Ray Bursts and their afterglows--described in the text and in innumerable previous occasions--is extremely successful and predictive. In a few intrinsically bright GRBs, gamma-rays with energies in the TeV range have been observed. The CB model, I argue, has no difficulty in describing the origin and approximate properties of these high-energy gamma rays and the extreme difficulty of observing their accompanying neutrinos.

2025-10-14, **Constraining neutrino electromagnetic properties with recent low-energy electron recoil data at dark matter direct detection experiments**, M. Demirci et.al., [2510.12449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12449v1)

 Neutrinos that are elastically scattered off atomic electrons provide a unique opportunity to investigate the Standard Model (SM) and beyond SM physics. In this work, we explore the new physics effects of neutrino electromagnetic properties through elastic neutrino-electron scattering using solar neutrinos at the low energy range of PandaX-4T and XENONnT experiments. The properties of interest include the neutrino magnetic moment, millicharge, and charge radius, all of which are natural consequences of non-zero neutrino masses. We investigate their effects by incorporating each property into the Standard Model (SM) framework, given the measured the solar neutrino flux. By analyzing the latest Run 0 and Run 1 datasets from the PandaX-4T experiment, together with recent results from XENONnT, we derive new constraints on each electromagnetic property of neutrino. We present both flavor-independent results, obtained using a common parameter for all three neutrino flavors, and flavor-dependent results, derived by marginalizing over the three neutrino flavor components. Bounds we obtained are comparable or improved compared to those reported in the previous studies.

2025-10-14, **Constraining Heavy Neutral Leptons Coupled to the Tau-Neutrino Flavor at the Large Hadron Collider**, Edis D. Tireli et.al., [2510.12248v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12248v1)

 Displaced vertex (DV) signatures at colliders offer a powerful probe of new long-lived particles beyond the Standard Model. Among the best-motivated candidates are heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) - heavier counterparts of Standard Model neutrinos - which can account for the origin of neutrino masses and potentially produce di-leptonic DV signatures.   In this study, we demonstrate how existing DV searches at the LHC can be extended to probe HNLs that couple predominantly to the tau-neutrino flavor. While current search strategies rely on identifying a prompt lepton alongside a displaced vertex, we show that analyzing events without a prompt lepton enables sensitivity to the process $pp \to W \to \tau N$, where the tau decays hadronically and the HNL subsequently decays to a lepton pair and a neutrino.   We perform detailed Monte Carlo simulations of this process with HNLs decaying to $\mu^+\mu^-$ or $e^+e^-$ final states, apply ATLAS-inspired selection criteria, and optimize signal sensitivity. In particular, we demonstrate that appropriate cuts in the plane of di-lepton invariant mass and DV radial position significantly enhance signal visibility. We propose several such optimized strategies and show that even with Run 2 data $139~\text{fb}^{-1}$ , existing bounds can be improved by more than an order of magnitude. Future high-luminosity runs may strengthen sensitivity by up to three orders of magnitude compared to current limits.

2025-10-13, **Ultraviolet radiation and neutrinos: two messengers from CCSNe in the CSM scenario**, Silvia Gagliardini et.al., [2510.11916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11916v1)

 Massive stars (>8 $M\_{\odot}$) often undergo intense mass loss through winds or eruptive events in the final stages of their evolution, leading to the formation of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). This material, expelled months to years before core collapse, shapes the pre-explosion environment and influences the early supernova (SN) emission. In particular, the interaction of the SN ejecta with the dense CSM can power an extended emission into the UV/optical bands, as seen in a growing fraction of type II SN. Recent events such as SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi confirm the relevance of dense environments and highlight the value of UV observations. Moreover, Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) may represent extreme cases of this interaction, possibly linked to more compact/massive CSM. In this work, we model the SN-CSM shock interaction in order to (i) estimate the maximum detection horizons and expected rates for future UV missions like ULTRASAT, and (ii) to estimate the intensity and expected rate of potential neutrino signals detectable by IceCube and KM3NeT. We then discuss the prospects for multi-messenger observations of such events in the near future.

2025-10-13, **New Tests of Low-Scale Quantum Gravity with Cosmic-Ray Collisions**, Manuel Ettengruber et.al., [2510.11879v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11879v1)

 Cosmic ray collisions at high center of mass energy could enable graviton and black hole production as expected in theories of low-scale quantum gravity, such as extra-dimensions, many species, or some versions of string theory. Here we propose three novel phenomenological tests of these theories. We first consider the collision of cosmic rays with ambient protons, electrons and photons in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), finding that high-energy neutrino data from the blazar TXS 0506+056 places a constraint on the fundamental scale of gravity of $M\_f \gtrsim 0.3$ TeV, and future high-energy neutrino data could raise this bound to $M\_f \gtrsim 200$ TeV. We then point out that collisions of pairs of cosmic rays could occur at a sizable rate in AGN where the accelerated cosmic rays are not collimated, or on supermassive black hole binaries. This consideration could potentially let us test unprecedented large fundamental scales of $M\_f \gtrsim 2$ PeV. We further compute the corresponding thermal neutrino emission arising from the Hawking evaporation of black holes produced in cosmic ray collisions, finding a spectrum that clearly differs from that expected in meson decays. Finally, we speculate with an scenario which would produce high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission from regions in the sky where no multi-wavelength counterparts would be expected, via graviton propagation from a different brane, which then decays in our Universe.

2025-10-13, **A SHIFT of Perspective: Observing Neutrinos at CMS and ATLAS**, Alfonso Garcia-Soto et.al., [2510.11816v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11816v1)

 We investigate the physics potential of SHIFT@LHC, a proposed gaseous fixed target installed in the LHC tunnel, as a novel source of detectable neutrinos. Using simulations of proton-gas collisions, hadron propagation, and neutrino interactions, we estimate that $O(10^4)$ muon-neutrino and $O(10^3)$ electron-neutrino interactions, spanning energies from 20 GeV to 1 TeV, would occur in the CMS and ATLAS detectors with 1% of the LHC Run-4 integrated luminosity. This unique configuration provides access to hadron production in the pseudorapidity range 5<$\eta$<8, complementary to existing LHC detectors. If realized, this would mark the first detection of neutrinos in a general-purpose LHC detector, opening a new avenue to study neutrino production and interactions in a regime directly relevant to atmospheric neutrino experiments.

2025-10-13, **Lepton Flavor Violation and Local Lepton Number**, Hridoy Debnath et.al., [2510.11774v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11774v1)

 We investigate the predictions for lepton number violating processes within the minimal theory of neutrino masses based on the spontaneous breaking of local lepton number. In this framework, the symmetry is broken at the low scale, leading to the existence of a viable dark matter candidate. The new fermions required for anomaly cancellation mediate lepton number violating processes at the one-loop level. We present a detailed calculation of the most relevant processes, including $\mu \to e \gamma$, $\mu \to 3 e$, and $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei. The regions of parameter space excluded by current experimental bounds are identified, and we emphasize the interplay between collider observables and charged lepton flavor violating signatures as a key test of this minimal theory of neutrino masses.

2025-10-13, **Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the νi process**, Xilu Wang et.al., [2510.11467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467v1)

 The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics. Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.

2025-10-13, **Resonant W and Z Boson Production in FSRQ Jets: Implications for Diffuse Neutrino Fluxes**, J. -H. Ha et.al., [2510.11030v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11030v2)

 Blazars, particularly Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), are well-known for their ability to accelerate a substantial population of electrons and positrons, as inferred from multiwavelength radiation observations. Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs. We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production could account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and emphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating that even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.

2025-10-14, **Dark Matter Boosted by Terrestrial Collisions**, Zamiul Alam et.al., [2510.12791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12791v1)

 Inelastic dark matter (IDM) models feature an energy threshold for scattering with Standard Model particles, which enables their consistency with the increasingly stringent limits placed by direct detection experiments. In a typical construction, elastic scattering is absent at tree level, and a lighter dark matter state must first upscatter into a heavier state in order to interact with the nuclei in the detector. We model the excitation of IDM in the Earth followed by its downscattering inside a detector, and we show that considering this process markedly enhances the sensitivity of existing detectors. In particular, current limits based on XENON100 and XENON1T data can be extended to significantly larger mass splittings.

2025-10-14, **OCTOPUS: A Versatile, User-Friendly, and Extensible Public Code for General-Relativistic Ray-Tracing in Spherically Symmetric and Static Spacetimes**, Shiyang Hu et.al., [2510.12585v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12585v1)

 This paper presents OCTOPUS, a relativistic ray-tracing algorithm developed within a Fortran-based, OpenMP-accelerated framework, designed for asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric curved spacetimes. The code efficiently and accurately computes key relativistic features -- including the black hole event horizon, photon rings, critical curves, and innermost stable circular orbits -- and simulates black hole shadows, redshift factor distributions, accretion disk images, toroidal images, as well as gravitational lensing, light curves, and gravitational radiation from hot-spots. OCTOPUS provides an automated, modular solution for qualitative studies of black hole observables and multi-messenger correlations between electromagnetic and gravitational signals in curved spacetime. Its implementation requires only the metric potential and its first-, second-, and third-order radial derivatives as input, ensuring low user barriers while remaining highly extensible and adaptable. Using a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter halo, we thoroughly validate the algorithm's precision, efficiency, and functionality, and investigate how dark matter halo parameters affect observational signatures. Our results demonstrate that increasing the scale and density of the dark matter halo strengthens the spacetime's gravitational field, an effect clearly reflected in black hole images and supported by hot-spot light curve signatures. A future version of OCTOPUS, with expanded capabilities for axisymmetric spacetimes, is planned for release.

2025-10-14, **Non-linear structure formation with elastic interactions in the dark sector**, Jose Beltrán Jiménez et.al., [2510.12551v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12551v1)

 Cosmological models where dark matter interacts with dark energy via a pure momentum transfer and with no energy exchange (i.e. elastic) provide compelling scenarios for addressing the apparent lack of structures at low redshift. In particular, it has been shown that measurements of $S\_8$ may show a statistically significant preference for the presence of elastic interactions. In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is not sufficiently strong as to disrupt virialised structures.

2025-10-14, **Search for dark matter production in association with bottom quarks and a lepton pair in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV**, CMS Collaboration et.al., [2510.12396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12396v1)

 A search is performed for dark matter produced in association with bottom quarks and a pair of electrons or muons in data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to 138 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. For the first time at the LHC, the associated production of a bottom quark-antiquark pair and a new heavy neutral Higgs boson (H) that subsequently decays into a leptonically decaying Z boson and a pseudoscalar (a) is explored. The latter acts as a dark matter mediator in the context of the two Higgs doublet model plus a pseudoscalar (2HDM+a). Multivariate techniques that target a wide range of mass configurations for the H and a particles are used. The observations are consistent with the expectations from standard model processes. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of cross section and branching fraction of the new particles, ranging from 10$^{-2}$ pb for an H mass of 400 GeV to 10$^{-3}$ pb for an H mass of 2000 GeV. Constraints on the parameter space of a benchmark 2HDM+a model are derived and compared with expectations in the context of cosmological predictions.

2025-10-14, **Experimental tests of the calibration of high precision differential astrometry for HWO**, Manon Lizzana et.al., [2510.12270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12270v1)

 Many different scientific applications require sub-micro arcsecond precision astrometry, including researching rocky exoplanets in the vicinity of the Sun and studying dark matter. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is a promising candidate to carry an astrometric instrument because it provides a stable, space-based telescope with a large aperture, which allows faint sources and small displacements to be observed. This paper presents the characterization of an appropriate detector for an astrometric instrument: the 46Mpx Gigapyx from Pyxalis. Moreover it explains the implementation of a testbed enabling interferometric characterization of pixel positions. Finally, the paper introduces a method for calibrating the telescope's optical distortion. This method was implemented in simulation and tested thanks to an optical bench developed at IPAG in France.

2025-10-14, **Is Milky Way stable all the way ? A TNG50 view from cosmic noon to the present day**, K. Aditya et.al., [2510.12263v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12263v1)

 We investigate the stability of Milky Way analogs (MWAs) in the \texttt{TNG50} simulation against the growth of local axisymmetric instabilities, tracing their evolution from cosmic noon ($z=2.5$) to the present day ($z=0$). Using a two-component stability criterion that accounts for stars, gas, and the force field of the dark matter halo, we compute the net stability parameter ($Q\_{T}$), the critical gas surface density ($\Sigma\_{c}$), and the instability timescale ($\tau$) for 10 barred and 10 unbarred MWAs. We find that these galaxies remain stable to axisymmetric instabilities at all epochs, with $Q\_{T}^{\min}>2$. The stability levels increase toward higher redshift, where enhanced gas velocity dispersion counterbalances the destabilizing effect of larger gas fractions. Further, the barred MWAs consistently show lower $Q\_{T}^{\min}$ than unbarred ones. The gas density remains subcritical ($\Sigma\_{g}<\Sigma\_{c}$) across radii and epochs, implying that local axisymmetric instabilities are not the primary channel for star formation. Growth timescales are short (a few Myr) in central regions but increase exponentially to several Gyr in the outer disc, naturally explaining the concentration of star formation toward galactic centers. We study the effect of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM and find that while MWAs are stable against axisymmetric instabilities $(Q\_{T}>1)$, a combination of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM can destabilize the disc at small scales even when $Q\_{T}>1$.

2025-10-14, **The importance of being non-minimally coupled: scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes**, Marco Calzà et.al., [2510.12257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12257v1)

 In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g\_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR<0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.

2025-10-13, **Phase space analysis of an exponential model in $f(Q)$ gravity including linear dark-sector interactions**, Ivan R. Vasquez et.al., [2510.12020v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12020v1)

 We present a cosmological analysis of an exponential $f(Q)$ gravity model, within the dynamical systems formalism. Following the method introduced by B\"ohmer \textit{et al} [Universe \textbf{9} no.4, 166 (2023)], the modified Friedmann modified equations are successfully reduced to an autonomous system. Given the exponential form of $f(Q)$, the equilibrium conditions result in transcendental equations, which we approximate to identify the critical points. We therefore perform a general stability analysis of these points in terms of the model parameters. Finally, we extend the model by including a linear dark energy-dark matter interaction, where the equilibrium points are found with their stability properties. The model exhibits the three main domination epochs in the Universe, as well as a non-trivial impact on the late-time de Sitter attractor.

2025-10-13, **Non-linear causal bulk viscosity in Unified Dark Matter Cosmologies**, Guillermo Palma et.al., [2510.11900v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11900v1)

 We propose a bulk viscous unified dark matter scenario based on a nonlinear extension of the full causal Israel-Stewart theory. This framework allows the viscous fluid to remain far from equilibrium, an essential feature for a physically consistent description of viscosity-driven accelerated expansion. We adopt the standard parametrization for the bulk viscosity, $\xi = \xi\_{0} \rho\_{m}^{s}$, treating $s$ as a free parameter, and study the model in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. By reformulating the cosmological equations as an autonomous dynamical system, we obtain both asymptotic analytical solutions and a numerical characterization of the phase space. At early times, the viscous component can mimic a stiff fluid, while at intermediate epochs it behaves like dark matter. With a suitable choice of dynamical variables, the system admits three distinct classes of late-time attractors. Two of them are separated by a basin-boundary saddle point: (i) a generic quintessence solution for $s = 1/2$, which encompasses a de Sitter-like behavior when $\xi\_{0}$ satisfies a specific relation involving the nonlinear parameters; (ii) a global exact de Sitter attractor for $s < 1/2$; and (iii) a phantom-like solution that emerges for $s \ge 1/2$. In contrast to the generic $s \ne 1/2$ case, the $s = 1/2$ scenario exhibits a qualitatively different stability structure, allowing de Sitter and phantom attractors to coexist. All solutions respect entropy production, and cosmic acceleration emerges independently of $\xi\_{0}$, relaxing the strong bounds $\xi\_{0} \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ required in Eckart-based viscous models.

2025-10-13, **Dynamically generated tilt of isocurvature fluctuations**, Saarik Kalia et.al., [2510.11803v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11803v1)

 Light scalar fields acquire isocurvature fluctuations during inflation. While these fluctuations could lead to interesting observable signatures at small scales, they are strongly constrained on large scales by cosmic microwave background observations. When the mass of the scalar is much lighter than the inflationary Hubble scale, $m\ll H\_I$, the spectrum of these fluctuations is flat. Meanwhile, if $m\gg H\_I$, the fluctuations are suppressed. A blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum which exhibits enhanced structure on small scales but avoids observational constraints on large scales therefore requires a coincidence of scales $m\sim H\_I$ for a free massive scalar. In this Letter, we show that if a scalar field possesses a nontrivial potential, its inflationary dynamics naturally cause this condition to be satisfied, and so a blue-tilted spectrum is generically expected for a large class of potentials. Specifically, if its potential $V$ exhibits a region which satisfies the slow-roll condition $V''<3H\_I^2$, the scalar condensate will spend most of inflation close to the boundary of this region, so that its effective mass is typically close to $H\_I$. The resulting blue tilt is inversely proportional to the number of $e$-folds of inflation prior to horizon crossing. If the scalar is long-lived, this mechanism leads to an attractor prediction for its relic abundance, which is insensitive to initial conditions of the scalar. In particular, a scalar field with quartic self-interactions can achieve the correct abundance to constitute all of the dark matter for a wide range of masses. We compute the relationship between the mass and self-coupling of quartic dark matter predicted by this mechanism.

2025-10-13, **Dwarf diversity in $Λ$CDM with baryons**, Akaxia Cruz et.al., [2510.11800v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11800v1)

 Observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies exhibit significant diversity at fixed halo mass, challenging galaxy formation within the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. Previous cosmological galaxy formation simulations with baryonic physics fail to reproduce the full diversity of rotation curves, suggesting either that there is a flaw in baryonic feedback models, or that an alternative to CDM must be invoked. In this work, we use the Marvelous Massive Dwarf zoom-in simulations, a suite of high-resolution dwarf simulations with $M\_{200}~\sim 10^{10}-10^{11}$ ${\rm M}\_{\odot}$ and $M\_{*}\sim 10^{7}-10^{9}$ ${\rm M}\_{\odot}$, designed to target the mass range where galaxy rotation curve diversity is maximized, i.e., between $V\_{\rm max} \sim 70-100~ {\rm km/s}$. We add to this a set of low-mass galaxies from the Marvel Dwarf Zoom Volumes to extend the galaxy mass range to lower values. Our fiducial star formation and feedback models produce simulated dwarfs with a broader range of rotation curve shapes, similar to observations. These are the first simulations that can both create dark matter cores via baryonic feedback, reproducing the slower rising rotation curves, while also allowing for compact galaxies and steeply rising rotation curves. Our simulated dwarfs also reproduce the observed size$-M\_*$ relation, including scatter, producing both extended and compact dwarfs for the first time in simulated field dwarfs. We explore star formation and feedback models and conclude that previous simulations may have had feedback that was too strong to produce compact dwarfs.

2025-10-13, **On the Speed-up of Wave-like Dark Matter Searches with Entangled Qubits**, Arushi Bodas et.al., [2510.11795v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11795v1)

 Qubit-based sensing platforms offer promising new directions for wave-like dark matter searches. Recent proposals demonstrate that entangled qubits can achieve quadratic scaling of the signal in the number of qubits. In this work we expand on these proposals to analyze the bandwidth and scan rate performance of entangled qubit protocols across different error regimes. We find that the phase-based readout of entangled protocols preserves the search bandwidth independent of qubit number, in contrast to power-based detection schemes, thereby achieving a genuine scan-rate advantage. We derive coherence time and error rate requirements for qubit systems to realize this advantage. Applying our analysis to dark photon searches, we find that entangled states of approximately 100 qubits can become competitive with benchmark photon-counting cavity experiments for masses $\gtrsim 30{-}40~\mu{\rm eV}$, provided sufficiently low error rates are achieved. The advantage increases at higher masses where cavity volume scaling becomes less favorable.

 We investigate the impact of residual annihilation from sub-GeV mass thermal relic dark matter candidates during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Focusing on candidates with $p$-wave annihilation channels, we show that the hadronic injection of pions and kaons beyond freeze-out, and their subsequent interaction with protons and neutrons prior to the deuterium bottleneck, provides a sensitivity to annihilation that surpasses that of the CMB and indirect detection in the galaxy.

2025-10-13, **Cross-correlation of Luminous Red Galaxies with ML-selected AGN in HSC-SSP III: HOD Parameters for Type I and Type II Quasars**, Rodrigo Córdova Rosado et.al., [2510.11780v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11780v1)

 Understanding the dark matter (DM) halo environment in which galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN) reside is a window into the nature of supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We apply halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling tools to interpret the angular cross-correlation functions between $1.5\times10^6$ luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and our $\sim28,500$ Hyper Suprime-Cam + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-selected (and $L\_{6 \mu m}$-limited) AGN to infer the halo properties of distinct quasar samples at physical scales $s>0.1\,{\rm Mpc}$, for $z\in0.7-1.0$. We find that Type I (unobscured) and Type II (obscured) AGN cluster differently, both on small and large physical scales. The derived HODs imply that Type I AGN reside, on average, in substantially ($\sim3\times$) more massive halos ($M\_h \sim 10^{13.4} M\_\odot$) than Type II AGN ($M\_h \sim 10^{12.9} M\_\odot$) at $>5\sigma$ significance. While Type II AGN show one-halo correlations similar to that of galaxies of their average halo mass, the Type I AGN intra-halo clustering signal is significantly shallower. We interpret this observation with HOD methods and find Type I AGN are significantly less likely ($f\_{sat}\sim0.05^{+1}\_{-0.05}\%$) to be found in satellite galaxies than Type II AGN. We find reddened + obscured AGN to have typical satellite fractions for their inferred average halo mass ($\sim10^{13} M\_\odot$), with $f\_{sat} \sim 20^{+10}\_{-5}\%$. Taken together, these results pose a significant challenge to the strict unified AGN morphological model, and instead suggest that a quasar's spectral class is strongly correlated with its host galaxy's dark matter halo environment. These intriguing results have provided a more complex picture of the SMBH -- DM halo connection, and motivate future analyses of the intrinsic galaxy and accretion properties of AGN.

 We revisit the upper bound on the annihilation cross-section, $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ of a stable dark matter (DM) of mass $5\times10^2-10^{14}$ GeV by considering five different channels: $W^+W^-$, $b\bar{b}$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $e^+e^-$. We use the observed electron and positron fluxes from CALET, DAMPE, HESS, positron flux from AMS-02, and gamma-ray flux from HAWC, GRAPES-3, CASA-MIA to constrain the annihilation cross-section. We also consider unstable DM of mass $10^3-10^{16}$~GeV decaying to $W^+W^-$, $b\bar{b}$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $e^+e^-$ and derive the corresponding lower bound on the DM lifetime, $\tau\_{\rm DM}$. We find that the latest data from CALET gives a stringent constraint on $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ in the low DM mass regime. For a typical DM mass of 1 TeV, we show that $\langle\sigma v\rangle\_{{\rm DM~DM}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^{-24})~\rm cm^3/s$ is disfavored. On the other hand in the low mass regime, the AMS-02 gives a much stringent limit on the DM lifetime, excluding $\tau\_{\rm DM\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-}\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{27})$ s for a 1 TeV mass of DM. In the high mass regime, typically $M\_{\rm DM}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ GeV, HAWC and CASA-MIA give the strongest constraints on $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ and $\tau\_{\rm DM}$.

 We apply a unified machine-learning framework based on Normalizing Flows (NFs) for the event-by-event reconstruction of invisible momenta and the subsequent evaluation of spin-sensitive observables in top-quark pair and dark-matter (DM) associated production processes. Building on recent studies in single-top + DM topologies, we extend the research to $t\bar{t}$ + DM final states. Inputs to our networks combine low-level four-momenta and missing transverse energy with high-level kinematic and angular variables. We compare a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressor, an autoregressive flow, and the conditional $\nu$-Flows model -- trained to learn the full conditional density. In these final states all the models perform well and demonstrate high reconstruction quality in independent regions split by $m\_{t\bar{t}}$ for validation purposes. We highlight the potential of this approach to be extended to three- and four-top-quark production.

 Three black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the Milky Way show rates of period decay which cannot be easily explained by standard mechanisms. Recently, it has been claimed that the anomalous period decays in two of these systems may be explained by dynamical friction due to very high dark matter (DM) densities around the black holes. We critically assess these claims by performing $N$-body simulations of binaries embedded in dense DM ``spikes". We simulate the previously-studied systems XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00, as well as studying the third binary Nova Muscae 1991 for the first time in this context. These simulations show that feedback on the DM distribution plays a crucial role and we rule out previously-claimed shallow DM spikes. We set lower limits on the steepness $\gamma$ of DM density profiles required to explain the period decay in these LMXBs, requiring $\gamma \gtrsim 2.15-2.20$ in XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00 and $\gamma \gtrsim 2.3$ in Nova Muscae 1991. Improved modeling of the long-term evolution of binaries embedded in DM spikes may allow us to exclude even larger densities in future.

2025-10-13, **From Primordial Stars to Early Galaxies: A Semi-Analytic Model Calibrated with Aeos and Renaissance**, Ryan Hazlett et.al., [2510.11629v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11629v1)

 We present an extension of our semi-analytic model that follows the formation of Population III stars and their metal-enriched descendants, incorporating dark matter halo merger trees from cosmological $N$-body simulations and feedback from reionization. Our extended model is calibrated using two complementary cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Aeos, which resolves individual Population III and II stars to $z\sim14.6$, and Renaissance, which is lower resolution but follows large-scale metal-enriched star formation to $z \sim 11$. With a combined calibration, we capture small-scale physics of primordial star formation over a large range in halo mass. We find good agreement between our calibrated model and Aeos, reproducing the evolution in number of star-forming halos and total stellar mass. Achieving this agreement requires increasing the normalization of, flattening the redshift dependence of, and adding scatter to the commonly used critical mass threshold $M\_{\mathrm{crit}}$. Our treatment of the delay between Pop III stellar death and subsequent Pop II star formation emphasizes the need to account for halos that have yet to transition to Pop II, since incomplete sampling of this delay in simulations limits physically motivated calibrations. Finally, we apply our model to larger-volume dark matter only simulations and predict $\sim10$ active Pop III sources at $z = 10$ lie within the area strongly lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416 with a magnification exceeding $\mu > 30$. These results demonstrate that semi-analytic approaches, when calibrated to hydrodynamical simulations, can provide accurate, computationally efficient predictions for the earliest stages of cosmic star formation.

2025-10-13, **Primordial Black Holes from Primordial Voids**, Cristian Joana et.al., [2510.11611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11611v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a compelling dark matter candidate and a unique probe of small-scale cosmological fluctuations. Their formation is usually attributed to large positive curvature perturbations, which collapse upon Hubble re-entry during radiation domination. In this work we investigate instead the role of negative curvature perturbations, corresponding to the growth of primordial void (PV) like regions. Using numerical relativity simulations, we show that sufficiently deep PV can undergo a nonlinear rebounce at the center, generating an effective overdensity that eventually collapses into a PBH. We determine the critical threshold for this process for a variety of equations of state, and demonstrate that the resulting black holes obey a scaling relation analogous to the standard overdensity case. These results establish primordial voids as a novel channel for PBH formation and highlight their potential impact on PBH abundances and cosmological signatures.

2025-10-13, **Note on Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy**, A. Sheykhi et.al., [2510.11569v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11569v1)

 It is well-known that any modification to the entropy expression not only change the energy density of the holographic dark energy, but also modifies the cosmological field equations through thermodynamics-gravity correspondence. Here we revisit the Kaniadakis holographic dark energy (KHDE) in the background of the modified Kaniadakis cosmology by incorporating the effects of Kaniadakis entropy into the Friedmann equations. We choose the Hubble radius, $L=H^{-1}$, as system's IR cutoff and determine the cosmological implications of this model. We first consider a dark energy (DE) dominated universe and reveal that this model mimics the cosmological constant with $w\_{DE}=-1$. This implies that the theoretical origin of the cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, may be understood through KHDE in the context of Kaniadakis cosmology. Remarkably, we observe that in the absence of interaction between DE and dark matter (DM), and in contrast to HDE in standard cosmology, our model can explain the current acceleration of the cosmic expansion for the Hubble radius as IR cutoff. When the interaction between DE and DM is taken into account, we see that the total equation of state parameter (EoS), $w\_{tot}=p\_{tot}/\rho\_{tot}$ can cross the phantom line at the present time. We also analyze the squared speed of sound, $v\_s^2$, for this model and find out that $(v\_s^2<0)$ for interacting KHDE. Investigating the statefinder, confirms the distinction between KHDE and $\Lambda$CDM model. It is seen that the statefinder diagram move away from the point of $\left\lbrace r,s\right\rbrace= \left\lbrace 1,0\right\rbrace$ with increasing the interaction parameter.

2025-10-13, **Updated constraints on interacting dark energy: A comprehensive analysis using multiple CMB probes, DESI DR2, and supernovae observations**, Tian-Nuo Li et.al., [2510.11363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11363v1)

 Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and DESY5 type Ia supernova (SN) data, indicate a significant deviation from $\Lambda$CDM, which seems to suggest that this deviation can be explained by an interaction between dark energy and dark matter. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis by utilizing the latest DESI DR2 BAO data in conjunction with CMB data from ACT, SPT, Planck, and WMAP, along with SN data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We consider four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our analysis indicates that CMB experiments other than Planck enhance the evidence for an interaction in the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho\_{\rm de}$. In particular, when using the SPT+DESI+DESY5 data, the IDE model with $Q = \beta H\_0 \rho\_{\rm de}$ gives $\beta = -0.4170 \pm 0.1220$, with a deviation from zero reaching $3.4\sigma$ level. When replacing DESY5 with PantheonPlus, this deviation weakens to $2.1\sigma$ level, but remains relatively significant. Furthermore, the Bayes factors of the IDE model with $Q = \beta H\_0 \rho\_{\rm de}$ are positive in all cases, providing a moderate-to-strong preference over $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, our comprehensive analysis clearly suggests that the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho\_{\rm de}$ (especially, $Q = \beta H\_0 \rho\_{\rm de}$) provide strong evidence supporting the existence of interaction and are more preferred by the current cosmological data.

2025-10-13, **Three Birds with One Stone: Core-Collapsed SIDM Halos as the Common Origin of Dense Perturbers in Lenses, Streams, and Satellites**, Hai-Bo Yu et.al., [2510.11006v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11006v1)

 We show that core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter halos of mass $\sim 10^6\,{M\_\odot}$, originally simulated to explain the dense perturber of the GD-1 stellar stream, also reproduce the structural properties inferred for the dense perturber detected in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666 from radio observations. Furthermore, these halos are sufficiently compact and dense to gravitationally capture field stars in satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, providing a natural explanation for the origin of Fornax 6, a stellar cluster in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Our results demonstrate that observations of halos with similar masses but residing in different cosmic environments offer a powerful and complementary probe of self-interacting dark matter.

2025-10-13, **Topological Landscapes of the BSM Higgs Sector**, Jyotiranjan Beuria et.al., [2510.10900v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10900v1)

 We explore the structure of the parameter space in the Singlet Scalar Dark Matter (SSDM) model and the Next-to-Two Higgs Doublet Model (N2HDM) with $\tan\beta = 5$ and $\tan\beta = 45$. Parameter points are classified as allowed or excluded based on compatibility with the Higgs observation constraints. Using a combined framework of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), we characterize the global geometry and topology of these high-dimensional landscapes. Our findings reveal that the SSDM and the N2HDM Type~I model exhibit finely tuned islands of collider viability. In the case of N2HDM Type~I, we also find that increasing $\tan\beta$ leads to greater topological fragmentation and higher Betti number persistence, indicating enhanced structural complexity. In contrast, the given choice of parameters excludes the entire N2HDM Type II parameter space based on current Higgs measurements. The topological properties serve as important quantitative descriptors for the phenomenological viability of the BSM frameworks. We leverage the above mentioned topological features to train machine learning models for faster characterization of the BSM Higgs sector into allowed and excluded parameter regions.

 I examine recent observations of the type Ia supernova remnant (SNR Ia) Tycho and conclude that Tycho is an SN Ia inside a planetary nebula (SNIP). The observations reveal two opposite protrusions, termed ears, projected on the main shell of Tycho. The pair of ear structures resembles that of the SNRs Ia Kepler, SNR G299-2.9, and SNR G1.9+0.3, which earlier studies considered as SNIPs. The requirement that the explosion occurs within hundreds of thousands of years after the formation of the planetary nebula (by the second star to evolve) makes the core-degenerate scenario the most likely for Tycho. Several other possible scenarios lead to an SNIP, but they are unlikely for Tycho. The identification of Tycho as an SNIP leads to two general conclusions. (1) The fraction of SNIPs among normal SNe Ia is very large, ~70-90%. Namely, the vast majority of normal SNe Ia are SNIPs. (2) To accommodate the large fraction of SNIPs, the delay time distribution of normal SNe Ia includes not only the stellar evolution timescale (as usually assumed), but also includes pockets of younger stellar populations in galaxies without ongoing star formation; the SNIPs come from the younger stellar populations in galaxies.

2025-10-14, **Alleviating the $H_0$ tension through new interacting dark energy model in light of DESI DR2**, Yi-Min Zhang et.al., [2510.12627v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12627v1)

 The $H\_0$ tension has become one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. The recent DESI DR2 data has shown a significant preference for dynamical dark energy, yet this has further exacerbated the $H\_0$ tension. In this work, we explore the potential of new interacting dark energy models ($\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM and $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM) to alleviate the $H\_0$ tension. We perform observational constraints using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescop, and type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus, as well as the SH0ES data. From our analysis, we observe the dynamical scale parameter of the cosmological constant, $\delta\_{\Lambda} = -0.410^{+0.140}\_{-0.120}$, in the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model using the CMB+DESI+SH0ES data, which deviates from $\Lambda$CDM at the $3.2\sigma$ level. Due to the anti-correlation between $\delta\_{\Lambda}$ and $H\_0$, a negative $\delta\_{\Lambda}$ results in a higher inferred $H\_0$. Consequently, we obtain $H\_0 = 71.90 \pm 1.00~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the $H\_0$ tension to $0.8\sigma$. Even without SH0ES, the CMB+DESI data alone still alleviate the $H\_0$ tension to $1.7\sigma$. Overall, the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model not only deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM model but also demonstrates a significant capability to alleviate the $H\_0$ tension.

 Young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) have recently regained interest as PeVatron candidates, potentially accounting for the cosmic-ray (CR) knee as alternatives to isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). LHAASO's unique capability to detect photons above 0.1 PeV, hence tracing multi-PeV CRs, can provide critical constraints on galactic acceleration models when combined with H.E.S.S. and Fermi-LAT data. We investigate the transport of particles from YMSCs acceleration sites, namely wind termination shocks (WTS) or embedded SNRs, to nearby dense molecular clouds where proton-proton interactions produce high-energy gamma rays. We determine the necessary conditions, such as the distance between the acceleration site and the target, or the cluster's power and age, for detectable gamma-ray excesses and identify viable systems through parameter space exploration. By comparing with observations, we can constrain key physical parameters including WTS efficiency, diffusion coefficient and injection slope. Our analysis also examines whether some of LHAASO's unidentified sources might correspond to such cluster-cloud systems.

 We present a catalog of 1.28 GHz radio filaments observed by MeerKAT over the innermost 200 pc of the Galaxy (roughly $\pm 1.5\deg$), which includes the central molecular zone (CMZ). The catalog is generated by repurposing software developed for the automated detection of filaments in solar coronal loops. There are two parts to the catalog. The first part, the main catalog, provides a point-by-point listing of locations and basic observational properties along each detected filament. The second part is a summary catalog which provides a listing of mean, median, or total values of various properties for each filament. Tabulated quantities include position, length, curvature, brightness, and spectral index. The catalogs contain a heterogeneous mix of filamentary structures, including nonthermal radio filaments (NRFs), and parts of supernova remnants (SNRs) and thermally emitting regions (e.g. H II regions). We discuss criteria for selecting useful subsamples of filaments from the catalogs, and some of the details encountered in examining filaments or selections of filaments from the catalogs.

 We review recent advances in the numerical modeling of turbulent flows and star formation. An overview of the most widely used simulation codes and their core capabilities is provided. We then examine methods for achieving the highest-resolution magnetohydrodynamical turbulence simulations to date, highlighting challenges related to numerical viscosity and resistivity. State-of-the-art approaches to modeling gravity and star formation are discussed in detail, including implementations of star particles and feedback from jets, winds, heating, ionization, and supernovae. We review the latest techniques for radiation hydrodynamics, including ray tracing, Monte Carlo, and moment methods, with comparisons between the flux-limited diffusion, moment-1, and variable Eddington tensor methods. The final chapter summarizes advances in cosmic-ray transport schemes, emphasizing their growing importance for connecting small-scale star formation physics with galaxy-scale evolution.

2025-10-14, **Violent mergers can explain the inflated state of some of the fastest stars in the Galaxy**, Aakash Bhat et.al., [2510.12197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12197v1)

 A significant number of hypervelocity stars with velocities between $1500-2500$ km/s have recently been observed. The only plausible explanation so far is that they have been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Since these stars are thought to be surviving donors of Type Ia supernovae, a surprising finding was that these stars are inflated, with radii an order of magnitude more than expected for Roche-lobe filling donors. Recent attempts at explaining them have combined 3-dimensional hydrodynamical supernova explosion simulations with 1-dimensional stellar modelling to explain the impact of supernova shocks on runaway white dwarfs. However, only the hottest and most compact of those runaway stars can so far marginally be reproduced by detailed models of runaways from supernova explosions. In this and a companion paper, we introduce a new \textsc{Arepo} simulation of two massive CO white dwarfs that explode via a violent merger. There, the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary is on its last orbit and plunging towards the primary. In the corresponding aftermath, the core of the secondary white dwarf of 0.16 M$\_\odot$, remains bound, moving at a velocity of $\sim2800$ km/s. We map this object into MESA, and show that this runaway star can explain the observations of two hypervelocity stars that were dubbed D6-1 and D6-3 based on their original discovery motivated by the D6 scenario, though the violent merger scenario presented here is somewhat distinct from the D6 scenario.

2025-10-14, **Short-Lived Radioisotopic enrichment from AGB interlopers in low-mass star-forming regions**, Joseph W. Eatson et.al., [2510.12079v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12079v1)

 The decay of Short-Lived Radioisotopes (SLRs) can be a significant source of heating early in protoplanetary systems, though how a protoplanetary disk becomes enriched with these SLRs far above the galactic background level remains an open question. Observational evidence suggests that this enrichment occurs during the period from when the disk forms to when it progresses into a protoplanetary system, and is homogenous throughout the resultant planetary system. Whilst SLRs such as 26Al and 60Fe can be injected into disks through interaction with Wolf-Rayet winds and supernovae, these outflows can disrupt disks, and in the case of low-mass star-forming regions high-mass stars may not form at all. Recent research has determined the existence of AGB ``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through star-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to WR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers on star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the enrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous N-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment is widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time at which the interloper intersects the star-forming region. Velocity is a factor, though interlopers travelling at 30 km/s are capable of enriching many disks in a star-forming region assuming they encounter a disk when the interloper is more evolved.

2025-10-13, **Eruptive mass loss less than a year before the explosion of superluminous supernovae. II. A systematic search for pre-explosion eruptions with VLT/X-shooter**, A. Gkini et.al., [2510.11799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11799v1)

 We present X-shooter observations of a sample of 21 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I), spanning a redshift range of z=0.13-0.95, aimed at searching for shells of circumstellar material (CSM). Specifically, we focus on identifying broad Mg II absorption features that are blueshifted by several thousand kilometers per second and have previously been interpreted as arising from resonance line scattering of the SLSN continuum by rapidly expanding CSM ejected shortly before explosion. Utilizing high-quality spectra, we model the region around 2800A to characterize the Mg II line profiles, enabling us to either confirm their presence or place constraints on undetected CSM shells. We identify five objects in our sample that show broad Mg II absorption features consistent with the presence of CSM. While SN2018ibb, SN2020xga and SN2022xgc have been previously reported, we identify previously undiscovered CSM shells in DES15S2nr and DES16C3ggu. These shells were likely expelled approximately two and three months, respectively, before the explosion of their associated SNe, timescales consistent with late-stage mass-loss episodes. We do not find any correlations between the shell properties and the SN properties, except for a marginal correlation between the light curve decline time scale and the shell velocities. We further demonstrate that CSM configurations similar to the majority of the detected shells would have been observable in spectra with signal-to-noise >8 per resolution element, and that the lines from a shell are in general detectable except in the cases where the shell is either very geometrically and/or optically thin. Therefore, we conclude that the detection of CSM shells is not a selection effect, but may instead point to the existence of a subclass of SLSNe-I undergoing late-stage shell ejections shortly before explosion.

 We present a study of the metal, dust, and molecular gas content in galaxies within the A2744-z7p9OD proto-cluster at z ~ 7.88. We focus on two galaxy groups, the Quintet and the Chain, which are covered by the ELPIS survey (The Emission-Line Protocluster Imaging Survey of the furthest overdensity beyond Pandora's Cluster Abell 2744). [C II] 158 um emission is detected in five galaxies, revealing molecular gas reservoirs with log(M\_gas/Msun) ~ 9.0-9.6, while dust continuum at the observed frame of 1.26 mm is detected in three galaxies, yielding dust masses of log(M\_dust/Msun) ~ 6.0-6.4, assuming a dust temperature of T\_dust = 45 (+15, -15) K. The derived properties, including stellar-to-dust mass ratios of log(M\_dust/M\_star) ~ -3 to -2 at log(M\_star/Msun) ~ 9, and dust-to-gas mass ratios of log(M\_dust/M\_gas) ~ -4 to -3 at 12+log(O/H) ~ 8, place these galaxies in an intermediate regime: higher than the very low ratios expected from supernova-driven dust production, but still below the levels attained once efficient grain growth dominates. These values indicate a transition phase of dust mass assembly, likely reflecting the onset of grain growth via metal accretion under accelerated evolution in the proto-cluster core.

2025-10-13, **Violent mergers revisited: The origin of the fastest stars in the Galaxy**, Rüdiger Pakmor et.al., [2510.11781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11781v1)

 Binary systems of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are one of the most promising candidates for the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae.   Violent mergers, where the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary white dwarf smashes onto it while being disrupted on its last orbit, were the first proposed double degenerate merger scenario that ignites dynamically.   However, violent mergers likely contribute only a few per cent to the total Type Ia supernova rate and do not yield normal Type Ia supernova light curves.   Here we revisit the scenario, simulating a violent merger with better methods, and in particular a more accurate treatment of the detonation.   We find good agreement with previous simulations, with one critical difference. The secondary white dwarf, being disrupted and accelerated towards the primary white dwarf, and impacted by its explosion, does not fully burn. Its core survives as a bound object.   The explosion leaves behind a $0.16\,\mathrm{M\_\odot}$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf travelling $2800\,\mathrm{km/s}$, making it an excellent (and so far the only) candidate to explain the origin of the fastest observed hyper-velocity white dwarfs.   We also show that before the explosion, $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{M\_\odot}$ of material consisting predominantly of helium, carbon, and oxygen has already been ejected at velocities above $1000\,\mathrm{km/s}$.   Finally, we argue that if a violent merger made D6-1 and D6-3, and violent mergers require the most massive primary white dwarfs in binaries of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, there has to be a much larger population of white dwarf mergers with slightly lower-mass primary white dwarfs. Because of its size, this population can essentially only give rise to normal Type Ia supernovae, likely exploding via the quadruple detonation channel and leaving no bound object behind.

 We present the PHANGS-MUSE/HST-Halpha nebulae catalogue, comprising 5177 spatially resolved nebulae across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies (< 20 Mpc), based on high-resolution Halpha imaging from HST, homogenised to a fixed 10 pc resolution and sensitivity. Combined with MUSE spectroscopy, this enables robust classification of 4882 H II regions and separation of planetary nebulae and supernova remnants. Electron densities for 2544 H II regions are derived using [S II] diagnostics, and nebular sizes measured via circularised radii and second moments yield a median of 20 pc, extending to sub-parsec scales. A structural complexity score traces substructure, showing that about a third of regions are H II complexes, with a higher fraction in galaxy centres. A luminosity-size relation calibrated from the HST sample is applied to 30,790 MUSE nebulae, recovering sizes down to 1 pc. Observed sizes exceed classical Stromgren radii, implying typical volume filling factors of 0.22. We associate 3349 H II regions with stellar populations from PHANGS-HST, finding median ages of 3 Myr and masses of 4-5 log(Msun). The dataset provides a detailed, spatially resolved link between nebular structure and ionising sources, serving as a benchmark for future studies of feedback, diffuse ionised gas, and star formation regulation in the interstellar medium. The full catalogue is made publicly available in machine-readable format.

2025-10-13, **BayeSN-TD: Time Delay and $H_0$ Estimation for Lensed SN H0pe**, M. Grayling et.al., [2510.11719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11719v1)

 We present BayeSN-TD, an enhanced implementation of the probabilistic type Ia supernova (SN Ia) BayeSN SED model, designed for fitting multiply-imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia). BayeSN-TD fits for magnifications and time-delays across multiple images while marginalising over an achromatic, Gaussian process-based treatment of microlensing, to allow for time-dependent deviations from a typical SN Ia SED caused by gravitational lensing by stars in the lensing system. BayeSN-TD is able to robustly infer time delays and produce well-calibrated uncertainties, even when applied to simulations based on a different SED model and incorporating chromatic microlensing, strongly validating its suitability for time-delay cosmography. We then apply BayeSN-TD to publicly available photometry of the glSN Ia SN H0pe, inferring time delays between images BA and BC of $\Delta T\_{BA}=121.9^{+9.5}\_{-7.5}$ days and $\Delta T\_{BC}=63.2^{+3.2}\_{-3.3}$ days along with absolute magnifications $\beta$ for each image, $\beta\_A = 2.38^{+0.72}\_{-0.54}$, $\beta\_B=5.27^{+1.25}\_{-1.02}$ and $\beta\_C=3.93^{+1.00}\_{-0.75}$. Combining our constraints on time-delays and magnifications with existing lens models of this system, we infer $H\_0=69.3^{+12.6}\_{-7.8}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with previous analysis of this system; incorporating additional constraints based on spectroscopy yields $H\_0=66.8^{+13.4}\_{-5.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. While this is not yet precise enough to draw a meaningful conclusion with regard to the `Hubble tension', upcoming analysis of SN H0pe with more accurate photometry enabled by template images, and other glSNe, will provide stronger constraints on $H\_0$; BayeSN-TD will be a valuable tool for these analyses.

 The light elements beryllium (Be; $Z=4$) and boron (B; $Z=5$) are mainly produced by spallation reactions between cosmic rays and carbon (C; $Z=6$), nitrogen (N; $Z=7$), and oxygen (O; $Z=8$) nuclei. Only traces of Be or B would have been produced in the Big Bang, but there could be a contribution from the $\nu$-process in type II supernovae. Their abundances at very low metallicities have been debated in the literature, with the aim of   understanding their origin.   Our aim is to derive the boron abundance in a sample of metal-poor stars based for the first time on observations with the   STIS spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope, using clean B lines measured in space ultraviolet.   We identified a measurable line of B I at 2089.6 A.   In our sample of metal-poor warm stars, this line is practically free from blending lines,   and for this reason the precision of the presently derived boron abundances is unprecedented.   We find that in the interval -2.6<[Fe/H]<-1.0, the slope of the relation A(B) versus [Fe/H] is significantly larger than 1, and thus steeper than that obtained with Be abundances. As a consequence, we find in this interval of metallicity a B/Be ratio that slightly increases with [Fe/H].   Since at [Fe/H]=-1 the abundance of B is already close to the solar abundance, there should be a break in the B enrichment at a metallicity of about [Fe/H]=-1.

 The Alcock-Paczynski (AP) parameter $F\_{AP}$ is independent of the sound horizon $r\_d$, making the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) AP measurements particularly well suited for cosmological applications. We propose a novel null test of cosmic curvature tailored to DESI BAO data that combines $F\_{AP}$ with the ratios $D\_V'/D\_V$ or $D\_M'/D\_M$. This null test can also be performed using a joint dataset of DESI BAO and type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) observations. Additionally, we use the test to assess the internal consistency and mutual compatibility of these datasets. We find that the data are compatible. Although the results show that a spatially flat universe is inconsistent with the data at low redshift $z\lesssim 0.5$, we cannot draw the conclusion that the observational data prefers $\Omega\_k\neq 0$ because there is no observational data in that region.

2025-10-13, **Updated constraints on interacting dark energy: A comprehensive analysis using multiple CMB probes, DESI DR2, and supernovae observations**, Tian-Nuo Li et.al., [2510.11363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11363v1)

 Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and DESY5 type Ia supernova (SN) data, indicate a significant deviation from $\Lambda$CDM, which seems to suggest that this deviation can be explained by an interaction between dark energy and dark matter. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis by utilizing the latest DESI DR2 BAO data in conjunction with CMB data from ACT, SPT, Planck, and WMAP, along with SN data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We consider four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our analysis indicates that CMB experiments other than Planck enhance the evidence for an interaction in the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho\_{\rm de}$. In particular, when using the SPT+DESI+DESY5 data, the IDE model with $Q = \beta H\_0 \rho\_{\rm de}$ gives $\beta = -0.4170 \pm 0.1220$, with a deviation from zero reaching $3.4\sigma$ level. When replacing DESY5 with PantheonPlus, this deviation weakens to $2.1\sigma$ level, but remains relatively significant. Furthermore, the Bayes factors of the IDE model with $Q = \beta H\_0 \rho\_{\rm de}$ are positive in all cases, providing a moderate-to-strong preference over $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, our comprehensive analysis clearly suggests that the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho\_{\rm de}$ (especially, $Q = \beta H\_0 \rho\_{\rm de}$) provide strong evidence supporting the existence of interaction and are more preferred by the current cosmological data.
