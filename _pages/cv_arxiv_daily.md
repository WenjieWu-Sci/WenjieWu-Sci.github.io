2023-03-27, **SiPM array of Xenoscope, a full-scale DARWIN vertical demonstrator**, R. Peres et.al., [2303.15300v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15300v1)

 The DARWIN project aims to build and operate a next-generation observatory for dark matter and neutrino physics, featuring a time projection chamber with a proposed active target of 40 t of liquid xenon. As an R&D facility to test fundamental components of the future detector, Xenoscope, a full-scale vertical demonstrator with ~400 kg of liquid xenon and up to 2.6 m electron drift length, was built at the University of Zurich. Its main objective is to demonstrate electron drift over unprecedented distances in liquid xenon - first in a purity monitor setup with charge readout, followed by a dual-phase time projection chamber. In this second phase, an array of 48 VUV4 MMPCs from Hamamatsu (model S13371-6050CQ-02) with a 12-channel readout will be placed above the liquid xenon column and operated as a light readout for the secondary proportional scintillation signals coming from extracted electrons in the time projection chamber. This work presents the design and development of the silicon photomultiplier array of Xenoscope, covering the structural and electronic design, sensor characterisation at cryogenic temperature and signal simulation.

2023-03-27, **Tri-Resonant Leptogenesis**, P. Candia da Silva et.al., [2303.15227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15227v1)

 We present a class of leptogenesis models where the light neutrinos acquire their observed mass through a symmetry-motivated construction. We consider an extension of the Standard Model, which includes three singlet neutrinos which have mass splittings comparable to their decay widths. We show that this tri-resonant structure leads to an appreciable increase in the observed CP asymmetry over that found previously in typical bi-resonant models. To analyse such tri-resonant scenarios, we solve a set of coupled Boltzmann equations, crucially preserving the variations in the relativistic degrees of freedom. We highlight the fact that small variations at high temperatures can have major implications for the evolution of the baryon asymmetry when the singlet neutrino mass scale is below $100$ GeV. We then illustrate how this variation can significantly affect the ability to find successful leptogenesis at these low masses. Finally, the parameter space for viable leptogenesis is delineated, and comparisons are made with current and future experiments.

2023-03-27, **Hybrid scoto/seesaw: flavour and dark matter**, D. M. Barreiros et.al., [2303.15118v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15118v1)

 We propose a model based on the interplay between the type-II seesaw and scotogenic neutrino mass generation mechanisms. The setup features a $\mathbb{Z}\_8$ discrete flavour symmetry which is broken down to a residual $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ responsible for stabilising dark matter. A singlet scalar field is introduced to implement spontaneous CP violation. The effective neutrino mass matrix two-texture zero structure leads to sharp neutrino sector predictions. We analyse the constraints imposed on the model by current and future charged lepton flavour violation experiments. This framework provides two viable dark matter candidates, scalar or fermion. We investigate the scalar dark matter scenario considering relic density, direct-detection and collider constraints.

2023-03-27, **Observation of a low energy nuclear recoil peak in the neutron calibration data of the CRESST-III Experiment**, CRESST Collaboration et.al., [2303.15315v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15315v1)

 New-generation direct searches for low mass dark matter feature detection thresholds at energies well below 100 eV, much lower than the energies of commonly used X-ray calibration sources. This requires new calibration sources with sub-keV energies. When searching for nuclear recoil signals, the calibration source should ideally cause mono-energetic nuclear recoils in the relevant energy range. Recently, a new calibration method based on the radiative neutron capture on $^{182}$W with subsequent de-excitation via single $\gamma$-emission leading to a nuclear recoil peak at 112 eV was proposed. The CRESST-III dark matter search operated several CaWO$\_{4}$-based detector modules with detection thresholds below 100 eV in the past years. We report the observation of a peak around the expected energy of 112 eV in the data of three different detector modules recorded while irradiated with neutrons from different AmBe calibration sources. We compare the properties of the observed peaks with Geant-4 simulations and assess the prospects of using this for the energy calibration of CRESST-III detectors.

2023-03-27, **Revisiting progenitor-age dependence of type Ia supernova luminosity standardization process**, Junchao Wang et.al., [2303.15267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15267v1)

 Much of the research in supernova cosmology is based on an assumption that the peak luminosity of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), after a standardization process, is independent of the galactic environment. A series of recent studies suggested that there is a significant correlation between the standardized luminosity and the progenitor age of SNe Ia. The correlation found in the most recent work by Lee et al. is strong enough to explain the extra dimming of distant SNe Ia, and therefore casts doubts on the direct evidence of cosmic acceleration. The present work improves the previous work by incorporating the uncertainties of progenitor ages, which were ignored in Lee et al., into a fully Bayesian inference framework. We find a weaker dependence of supernova standardized luminosity on the progenitor age, but the detection of correlation remains significant (3.3$\sigma$). Assuming that such correlation can be extended to high redshift and applying it to the Pantheon SN Ia data set, we find that the correlation cannot be the primary cause of the observed extra dimming of distant SNe Ia. Further more, we use the PAge formalism, which is a good approximation to many dark energy and modified gravity models, to do a model comparison. The concordance Lambda cold dark matter model remains a good fit when the progenitor-age dependence of SN Ia luminosity is corrected. The best-fit parameters, however, are in $\sim 2\sigma$ tension with the standard values inferred from cosmic microwave background observations.

2023-03-27, **Inflation and Dark Matter in the $Z_5$ Model**, XinXin Qi et.al., [2303.15169v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15169v1)

 We discuss the possibility of unifying dark matter physics and inflation in the $Z\_5$ model of the two-component dark matter. Inflation driven by the two-component dark matter fields can be divided into two cases, singlet dark matter inflation and mixed dark matter inflation, where both two-component play the role of inflaton in the latter case. For dark matter, we focus on the mixed dark matter inflation case. We show a viable parameter space that satisfies the theoretical and dark matter relic density constraint in the case of successful inflation. It turns out that the dark matter density is dominated by the light component, which is consistent with the feature of the $Z\_5$ model of the two-component dark matter.

2023-03-26, **Detecting Low-Mass Perturbers in Cluster Lenses using Curved Arc Bases**, Atınç Çağan Şengül et.al., [2303.14786v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14786v1)

 Strong gravitationally lensed arcs and arclets produced by the mass distribution in galaxy clusters have been observationally detected for several decades now. These strong lensing constraints provided high-fidelity mass models for cluster lenses that include a detailed census of the substructure down to $10^{9-10}\,\mathrm{M}\_\odot$. Optimizing lens models, where the cluster mass distribution is modeled by a smooth component and subhalos associated with the locations of individual cluster galaxies, has enabled deriving the subhalo mass function, providing important constraints on the nature and granularity of dark matter. In this work, we explore and present a novel method to detect and measure individual perturbers (subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and wandering supermassive black holes) by exploiting their proximity to highly distorted lensed arcs in galaxy clusters, and by modeling the local lensing distortions with curved arc bases. This method offers the possibility of detecting individual low-mass perturber subhalos in clusters and halos along the line-of-sight down to a mass resolution of $10^8\, \mathrm{M}\_\odot$. We quantify our sensitivity to low-mass perturbers with masses $M \sim 10^{7-9}\,\mathrm{M}\_\odot$ in clusters with masses $M \sim 10^{14-15}\mathrm{M}\_\odot$, by creating realistic mock data. Using three lensed images of a background galaxy in the cluster SMACS J0723, as seen by the $\textit{James Webb Space Telescope}$, we study the retrieval of the properties of potential perturbers with masses $M = 10^{7-9}\,\mathrm{M}\_\odot$. From the derived posterior probability distributions for the perturber, we constrain its concentration, redshift, and ellipticity. By allowing us to probe lower-mass substructures, the use of the curved arc bases can lead to powerful constraints on the nature of dark matter as discrimination between dark matter models appears on smaller scales.

2023-03-26, **The $Z$ resonance, inelastic dark matter, and new physics anomalies in the Simple Extension of the Standard Model (SESM) with general scalar potential**, Wenxing Zhang et.al., [2303.14764v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14764v1)

 We consider the generic scalar potential with CP-violation, and study the $Z$ resonance and inelastic dark matter in the Simple Extension of the Standard Model (SESM), which can explain the dark matter as well as new physics anomalies such as the B physics anomalies and muon anomalous magnetic moment, etc. With the new scalar potential terms, we obtain the mass splittings for the real and imaginary parts of scalar fields. And thus we can have the DM co-annihilation process mediated by $Z$ boson, which couples exclusively to the CP-even and CP-odd parts of scalar fields. This is a brand new feature compared to the previous study. For the CP conserving case, we present the viable parameter space for the Higgs and $Z$ resonances, which can explain the B physics anomalies, muon anomalous magnetic moment, and dark matter relic density, as well as evade the constraint from the XENON1T direct detection simultaneously. For the CP-violating case, we consider the inelastic dark matter, and study four concrete scenarios for the inelastic DM-nucleon scatterings mediated by the Higgs and $Z$ bosons in details. Also, we present the benchmark points which satisfy the aforementioned constraints. Furthermore, we investigate the constraints from the dark matter-electron inelastic scattering processes mediated by the Higgs and $Z$ bosons in light of the XENONnT data. We show that the constraint on the $Z$ mediated process is weak, while the Higgs mediated process excludes the dark matter with mass around several MeV.

2023-03-26, **A Torsional Two-Component Description of the Motion of Dirac Particles at Early Stages of the Cosmic Evolution**, J. G. Cardoso et.al., [2303.14755v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14755v1)

 It is assumed that the non-singular big-bang birth of the Universe as set forth by Einstein-Cartan's theory particularly brought about the appearance of the cosmic microwave and dark energy backgrounds, dark matter, gravitons as well as of Dirac particles. On account of this assumption, a two-component description of the motion of quarks and leptons prior to the occurrence of hadronization is presented within the framework of the torsionful {\epsilon}-formalism of Infeld and van der Waerden. The relevant field equations are settled on the basis of the implementation of conjugate minimal coupling covariant derivative operators that carry additively typical potentials for the cosmic backgrounds such as geometrically specified in a previous work. It appears that the derivation of the wave equations which control the spacetime propagation of Dirac fields at very early stages of the cosmic evolution, must be tied up with the applicability of certain subsidiary relations. The wave equations themselves suggest that quarks and leptons interact not only with both of the cosmic backgrounds, but also with dark matter. Nevertheless, it becomes manifest that the inner structure of the framework allowed for does not give rise at all to any interaction between gravitons and Dirac particles. The overall formulation ascribes an intrinsically non-geometric character to Dirac's theory, in addition to exhibiting a formal evidence that dark energy and dark matter must have partaken of a cosmic process of hadronization.

2023-03-26, **First Dark Matter Search with Nuclear Recoils from the XENONnT Experiment**, XENON Collaboration et.al., [2303.14729v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14729v1)

 We report on the first search for nuclear recoils from dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with the XENONnT experiment which is based on a two-phase time projection chamber with a sensitive liquid xenon mass of $5.9$~t. During the approximately 1.1 tonne-year exposure used for this search, the intrinsic $^{85}$Kr and $^{222}$Rn concentrations in the liquid target were reduced to unprecedentedly low levels, giving an electronic recoil background rate of $(15.8\pm1.3)~\mathrm{events}/(\mathrm{t\cdot y \cdot keV})$ in the region of interest. A blind analysis of nuclear recoil events with energies between $3.3$~keV and $60.5$~keV finds no significant excess. This leads to a minimum upper limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section of $2.58\times 10^{-47}~\mathrm{cm}^2$ for a WIMP mass of $28~\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ at $90\%$ confidence level. Limits for spin-dependent interactions are also provided. Both the limit and the sensitivity for the full range of WIMP masses analyzed here improve on previous results obtained with the XENON1T experiment for the same exposure.

2023-03-27, **Identifying gravitationally lensed supernovae within the Zwicky Transient Facility public survey**, M. R. Magee et.al., [2303.15439v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15439v1)

 Strong gravitational lensing of supernovae is exceedingly rare. To date, only a handful of lensed supernovae are known. Despite their rarity, lensed supernovae have emerged as one of the most promising methods for measuring the current expansion rate of the Universe and breaking the Hubble tension. We present an extensive search for gravitationally lensed supernovae within the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public survey, covering 12,524 transients with good light curves discovered during four years of observations. We crossmatch a catalogue of known and candidate lens galaxies with our transient sample and find only one coincident source, which was due to chance alignment. To search for supernovae magnified by unknown lens galaxies, we test multiple methods that have been suggested in the literature, for the first time on real data. This includes selecting objects with extremely red colours and those that appear inconsistent with the host galaxy redshift. In both cases, we find a few hundred candidates, most of which are due to contamination from activate galactic nuclei, bogus detections, or unlensed supernovae. The false positive rate from these methods presents significant challenges for future surveys. In total, 65 unique transients were identified across all of our selection methods that required detailed manual rejection, which would be infeasible for larger samples. Overall, we do not find any compelling candidates for lensed supernovae, which is broadly consistent with previous estimates for the rate of lensed supernovae in the ZTF public survey and the number expected to pass the selection cuts we apply.

2023-03-27, **Revisiting progenitor-age dependence of type Ia supernova luminosity standardization process**, Junchao Wang et.al., [2303.15267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15267v1)

The best-fit parameters, however, are in $\sim 2\sigma$ tension with the standard values inferred from cosmic microwave background observations.

2023-03-27, **Low-redshift estimates of the absolute scale of baryon acoustic oscillations**, Thais Lemos et.al., [2303.15066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15066v1)

 Measurements of the characteristic length scale $r\_s$ of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide a robust determination of the distance-redshift relation. Currently, the best (sub-per cent) estimate of $r\_s$ at the drag epoch is provided by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations assuming the validity of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at $z \sim 1000$. Therefore, inferring $r\_s$ from low-$z$ observations in a model-independent way and comparing its value with CMB estimates provides a consistency test of the standard cosmology and its assumptions at high-$z$. In this paper, we address this question and estimate the absolute BAO scale combining angular BAO measurements and type Ia Supernovae data. Our analysis uses two different methods to connect these data sets and finds a good agreement between the low-$z$ estimates of $r\_{s}$ with the CMB sound horizon at drag epoch, regardless of the value of the Hubble constant $H\_0$ considered. These results highlight the robustness of the standard cosmology at the same time that they also reinforce the need for more precise cosmological observations at low-$z$.

2023-03-27, **Strengthening extended Gravity constraints with combined systems:\\ \texorpdfstring{$f(R)$}{} bounds from Cosmology and the Galactic Center**, D. Benisty et.al., [2303.15040v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15040v1)

 MOdified Gravity (MoG)) is widely constrained in different astrophysical and astronomical systems. Since these different systems are based on different scales it is not trivial to get a combined constraint that is based on different phenomenology. Here, for the first time (to the best of our knowledge), we combine constraints for MoG from late time Cosmology and the orbital motion of the stars around the galactic center. MoG give different potentials that are tested directly in the galactic center. The cosmological data set includes the type Ia supernova and baryon acoustic oscillations. For the galactic star center data set we use the published orbital measurements of the S2 star. The constraints on the universal parameter $\beta$ from the combined system give: $\beta\_{HS}=0.154 \pm 0.109$ for the Hu-Sawicki model, while $\beta\_{St}= 0.309 \pm 0.19 $ for the Starobinsky model. These results improve on the cosmological results we obtain. The results show that {{\it combined constraint}} from different systems yields a stronger constraint for different theories under consideration. Future measurements from the galactic center and from cosmology will give better constraints on MoG.

2023-03-27, **Sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array to spectral signatures of hadronic PeVatrons with application to Galactic Supernova Remnants**, The Cherenkov Telescope Array Consortium et.al., [2303.15007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15007v1)

 The local Cosmic Ray (CR) energy spectrum exhibits a spectral softening at energies around 3~PeV. Sources which are capable of accelerating hadrons to such energies are called hadronic PeVatrons. However, hadronic PeVatrons have not yet been firmly identified within the Galaxy. Several source classes, including Galactic Supernova Remnants (SNRs), have been proposed as PeVatron candidates. The potential to search for hadronic PeVatrons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is assessed. The focus is on the usage of very high energy $\gamma$-ray spectral signatures for the identification of PeVatrons. Assuming that SNRs can accelerate CRs up to knee energies, the number of Galactic SNRs which can be identified as PeVatrons with CTA is estimated within a model for the evolution of SNRs. Additionally, the potential of a follow-up observation strategy under moonlight conditions for PeVatron searches is investigated. Statistical methods for the identification of PeVatrons are introduced, and realistic Monte--Carlo simulations of the response of the CTA observatory to the emission spectra from hadronic PeVatrons are performed. Based on simulations of a simplified model for the evolution for SNRs, the detection of a $\gamma$-ray signal from in average 9 Galactic PeVatron SNRs is expected to result from the scan of the Galactic plane with CTA after 10 hours of exposure. CTA is also shown to have excellent potential to confirm these sources as PeVatrons in deep observations with $\mathcal{O}(100)$ hours of exposure per source.

2023-03-26, **Measuring the speed of light with updated Hubble diagram of high-redshift standard candles**, Yuting Liu et.al., [2303.14674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14674v1)

 The possible time variation of the fundamental constants of nature has been an active subject of research in modern physics. In this paper, we propose a new method to investigate such possible time variation of the speed of light $c$ using the updated Hubble diagram of high-redshift standard candles including Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) and high-redshift quasars (based on UV-X relation). Our findings show that the SNe Ia Pantheon sample, combined with currently available sample of cosmic chronometers, would produce robust constraints on the speed of light at the level of $c/c\_0=1.03\pm0.03$. For the Hubble diagram of UV+X ray quasars acting as a new type of standard candles, we obtain $c/c\_0=1.19\pm0.07$. Therefore, our results confirm that there is no strong evidence for the deviation from the constant speed of light up to $z\sim 2$. Moreover, we discuss how our technique might be improved at much higher redshifts ($z\sim5$), focusing on future measurements of the acceleration parameter $X(z)$ with gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star mergers. In particular, in the framework of the second-generation space-based GW detector, DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO), the speed of light is expected to be constrained with the precision of $\Delta{c}/c=10^{-3}$.
