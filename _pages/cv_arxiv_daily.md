2025-09-04, **Generation of Lognormal Synthetic Lyman-$Î±$ Forest Spectra for $P_{1D}$ Analysis**, Meagan Herbold et.al., [2509.04405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04405v1)

 The one-dimensional flux power spectrum (P1D) of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest probes small-scale structure in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is therefore sensitive to a variety of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. These include the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, the thermal history of the IGM, the sum of neutrino masses, and potential small-scale fluctuations due to the nature of dark matter. However, P1D is also highly sensitive to observational and instrumental systematics, making accurate synthetic spectra essential for validating analyses and quantifying these effects, especially in high-volume surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We present an efficient lognormal mock framework for generating one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectra tailored for P1D analysis. Our method captures the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted flux and the scale-dependent shape and amplitude of the one-dimensional flux power spectrum by tuning Gaussian field correlations and transformation parameters. Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \leq z \leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \leq k \leq 1.0$ s km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to sub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we discuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of astrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects. Such improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and enable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D inference and precision cosmology.

2025-09-04, **Precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters with 10 years of data from the NOvA experiment**, The NOvA Collaboration et.al., [2509.04361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04361v1)

 This Letter reports measurements of muon-neutrino disappearance and electron-neutrino appearance and the corresponding antineutrino processes between the two NOvA detectors in the NuMI neutrino beam. These measurements use a dataset with double the neutrino mode beam exposure that was previously analyzed, along with improved simulation and analysis techniques. A joint fit to these samples in the three-flavor paradigm results in the most precise single-experiment constraint on the atmospheric neutrino mass-splitting, $\Delta m^2\_{32}= 2.431^{+0.036}\_{-0.034} (-2.479^{+0.036}\_{-0.036}) \times 10^{-3}$~eV$^2$ if the mass ordering is Normal (Inverted). In both orderings, a region close to maximal mixing with $\sin^2\theta\_{23}=0.55^{+0.06}\_{-0.02}$ is preferred. The NOvA data show a mild preference for the Normal mass ordering with a Bayes factor of 2.4 (corresponding to 70\% of the posterior probability), indicating that the Normal ordering is 2.4 times more probable than the Inverted ordering. When incorporating a 2D $\Delta m^2\_{32}\textrm{--}\sin^2 2\theta\_{13}$ constraint based on Daya Bay data, this preference strengthens to a Bayes factor of 6.6 (87\%).

2025-09-04, **POEMMA-Balloon with Radio: An Overview**, J. Eser et.al., [2509.04302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04302v1)

 The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is an Ultra Long Duration Balloon payload scheduled for launch in Spring 2027 from Wanaka, New Zealand. It will circle over the Southern Ocean for a mission duration as long as 50 days, serving as a precursor to the dual satellite mission, Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). The PBR mission represents a significant step towards establishing a space-based multi-messenger observatory. Observations from space will enhance the statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and complement ground-based observatories by enabling simultaneous observations of both hemispheres with a single instrument. Additionally, POEMMA will facilitate the measurement of Very-High-Energy Neutrinos (VHENs) following multi-messenger alerts of astrophysical transient events, such as gamma-ray bursts. PBR is an adaptation of the POEMMA mission, featuring three primary science goals: 1. Observe Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) via the fluorescence technique from suborbital space. 2. Observe horizontal high-altitude air showers (HAHAs) with energies exceeding the cosmic ray knee (E > 3 PeV) using optical and radio detection for the first time. 3. Follow astrophysical event alerts in the search for VHENs. This contribution provides an overview of the PBR payload and discusses the expected performance of its various detectors.

2025-09-04, **Neutrino absorption in two-flavor color-superconducting quark matter**, Mark G. Alford et.al., [2509.04240v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04240v1)

 We calculate the absorption mean free paths of electron and muon neutrinos in two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) quark matter in the density and temperature range that is relevant to binary neutron star mergers. We model the strong interaction between quarks using a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, performing calculations self-consistently in the mean-field approximation. Since the 2SC gap is large we restrict our analysis to the contribution of unpaired quarks. We find that at low temperatures absorption by a down quark $\nu+d \to u+e^-/\mu^-$ is kinematically not allowed, so absorption by a strange quark $\nu+s \to u+e^-/\mu^-$ dominates the mean free path. As temperature or neutrino energy rises, the $d$ quark absorption channel becomes active, and the mean free path shrinks. We find that in equilibrated 2SC matter with an electron lepton fraction $Y\_{L\_e}=0.1$, the neutrinos form a degenerate gas with a mean free path of meters or less, independent of the temperature.

2025-09-04, **Cosmic-Ray Boosted Diffuse Supernova Neutrinos**, Alexander Sandrock et.al., [2509.04229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04229v1)

 The subject of boosted fluxes of dark matter or cosmic relic neutrinos via scattering on cosmic rays has received considerable attention recently. This article investigates the boosted neutrino flux from scattering of cosmic rays and the so-far undetected diffuse supernova neutrino background, taking into account both galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays. The calculated flux is many orders of magnitude smaller than either the galactic diffuse neutrino emission, the extragalactic astrophysical flux measured by IceCube, or the cosmogenic neutrino flux expected at the highest energies.

2025-09-04, **Toward precision physics tests with future COHERENT detectors**, M. Atzori Corona et.al., [2509.04205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04205v1)

 We present a comprehensive sensitivity study of future CE$\nu$NS detectors, focusing on a cryogenic cesium iodide detector and a tonne-scale liquid argon one, currently being developed by the COHERENT Collaboration. These setups will enable precision measurements of the weak mixing angle at low energies and allow accurate extraction of the neutron nuclear distribution radius. We also demonstrate that next-generation detectors will place constraints on the neutrino charge radius comparable to or better than current global fits. In addition, we explore the sensitivity to non standard neutrino electromagnetic properties, such as magnetic moments and millicharges, as well as new mediators. These findings reinforce the role of CE$\nu$NS experiments in the upcoming precision era, with future detectors playing a key role in advancing our understanding of neutrino interactions and electroweak physics at low energies.

2025-09-04, **Can Quasi-periodic Eruptions Produce Detectable High Energy Neutrinos?**, Zhi-peng Ma et.al., [2509.03904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03904v1)

 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a class of X-ray flaring phenomena that occur at the centers of galactic nuclei and are likely to arise from repeated interactions between a star and an accretion disk. This work investigates whether such disk-crossing events can accelerate protons and generate detectable high-energy neutrinos. Based on observed QPE luminosities, recurrence periods, and flare durations, the stellar motion parameters and the disk properties are evaluated. We consider proton acceleration during the breakout phase and evaluate neutrino production, accounting for both $pp$ and $p\gamma$ interactions. Applying the method to ten observed QPE sources, we estimate the neutrino fluence accumulated over a 10-year observation period and compute the corresponding detection numbers for IceCube and IceCube-Gen2. Our analysis indicates that protons can be accelerated up to several tens of TeV, and neutrino production is mostly confined below $\sim 10~\mathrm{TeV}$. The resulting optimized neutrino fluence spans from $ 7.0 \times 10^{-7} $ to $1.5 \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{GeV~cm^{-2}}$ for these ten QPE sources. We find that the expected neutrino detection number for a single QPE source is low, and the expected neutrino detection number would approach unity only for the most promising QPE source occurring at a distance closer than a few Mpc. Next-generation neutrino telescopes with better detection sensitivities at $\lesssim \rm TeV$ can significantly improve the capture capacity of the cumulative neutrino signal from the QPE population.

2025-09-03, **From CREX to CEvNS: The Weak Radius of 40Ar**, J. Piekarewicz et.al., [2509.03645v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03645v1)

 Despite significant theoretical efforts, the CREX-PREX dilemma remains unresolved, preventing the reliable prediction of neutron (or weak-charge) radii that, besides their intrinsic nuclear-structure interest, often serve to quantify the impact of nuclear uncertainties in searches for new physics. Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering is a clean and attractive portal to new physics whose sensitivity may be impacted by such nuclear uncertainties. In this paper we use CREX as our main anchor, together with a strong calcium-argon correlation, to provide a robust baseline for the weak radius of ${}^{40}$Ar: $R\_{\rm wk}^{\,40} = 3.452 \pm 0.028~\text{(stat)} \pm 0.022~\text{(syst)}\,\text{fm}$.The weak radius of argon is an observable highly relevant to ongoing and future liquid-argon campaigns that encodes the loss of coherence at small momentum transfers.

2025-09-03, **Measurement of single charged pion production in charged-current $Î½_Î¼$-Ar interactions with the MicroBooNE detector**, P. Abratenko et.al., [2509.03628v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03628v1)

 We present flux-averaged charged-current $\nu\_\mu$ cross-section measurements on argon for final states containing exactly one $\pi^\pm$ and no other hadrons except nucleons. The analysis uses data from the MicroBooNE experiment in the Booster Neutrino Beam, corresponding to $1.11 \times 10^{21}$ protons on target. Total and single-differential cross-section measurements are provided within a phase space restricted to muon momenta above 150 MeV, pion momenta above 100 MeV, and muon-pion opening angles smaller than 2.65 rad. Differential cross sections are reported with respect to the scattering angles of the muon and pion relative to the beam direction, their momenta, and their combined opening angle. The differential cross section with respect to muon momentum is based on a subset of selected events with the muon track fully contained in the detector, whereas the cross section with respect to pion momentum is based on a subset of selected events rich in pions that have not hadronically scattered on the argon before coming to rest. The latter has not been measured on argon before. The total cross section is measured as $(3.75~\pm~0.07~\textrm{(stat.)}~\pm~0.80~\textrm{(syst.)}) \times 10^{-38} \, \text{cm}^2/\text{Ar}$ at a mean energy of approximately 0.8 GeV. Comparisons of the measured cross sections with predictions from multiple neutrino-nucleus interaction generators show good overall agreement, except at very forward muon angles.

2025-09-03, **Tracing the Neutrino-Induced Phase Shift in the 21-cm Spectrum**, Gabriele Montefalcone et.al., [2509.03595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03595v1)

 We study the phase shift that free-streaming neutrinos imprint on the 21-cm power spectrum during cosmic dawn, computing for the first time its effect on both density- and velocity-induced acoustic oscillations. Neutrinos are known to generate a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations of the photon-baryon plasma before recombination, a signature already detected in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as well as the spectrum of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) extracted from galaxy surveys. We show that in the 21-cm signal this phase shift is distinct from that observed in the CMB and BAO spectra, exhibiting a characteristic mode and redshift dependence arising from the additional contribution of the so-called velocity acoustic oscillations (VAOs), sourced by the baryon-dark matter relative velocities. Our results establish the phase of acoustic oscillations in the 21-cm spectrum as a promising new avenue for probing free-streaming light relics at cosmic dawn, complementary to existing CMB and BAO measurements.

2025-09-03, **Testing Seesaw and Leptogenesis via Gravitational Waves: Majorana versus Dirac**, Anish Ghoshal et.al., [2509.03579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03579v1)

 We investigate the B-L gauge extension of the Standard Model that the Dirac seesaw mechanism with thermal Leptogenesis can be tested using the stochastic gravitational background (SGWB) emanating from a network of cosmic strings when B-L symmetry is broken. With right-handed neutrino mass lighter than the typical scale of grand unification, the B-L symmetry protecting the right-handed neutrinos leads to constraints on the Yukawa couplings for both Dirac and Majorana scenarios. Estimating the predicted gravitational wave background we find that future space-borne missions could probe the range concerning thermal Dirac Leptogenesis. In a comparative analysis between such probes of gravitational wave sourced from cosmic strings in Dirac and Majorana Leptogenesis in the B-L extension, based on the energy scales of the Leptogenesis, for instance, GW detectors will be able to probe the scale of Dirac Leptogenesis upto $ 10^{9}$ GeV, while for Majorana Leptogenesis it would be upto $ 10^{12}$ GeV.

2025-09-03, **Particle background characterization and prediction for the NUCLEUS reactor CE$Î½$NS experiment**, H. Abele et.al., [2509.03559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03559v1)

 NUCLEUS is a cryogenic detection experiment which aims to measure Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) and to search for new physics at the Chooz nuclear power plant in France. This article reports on the prediction of particle-induced backgrounds, especially focusing on the sub-keV energy range, which is a poorly known region where most of the CE$\nu$NS signal from reactor antineutrinos is expected. Together with measurements of the environmental background radiations at the experimental site, extensive Monte Carlo simulations based on the Geant4 package were run both to optimize the experimental setup for background reduction and to estimate the residual rates arising from different contributions such as cosmic ray-induced radiations, environmental gammas and material radioactivity. The NUCLEUS experimental setup is predicted to achieve a total rejection power of more than two orders of magnitude, leaving a residual background component which is strongly dominated by cosmic ray-induced neutrons. In the CE$\nu$NS signal region of interest between 10 and 100 eV, a total particle background rate of $\sim$ 250 d$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$keV$^{-1}$ is expected in the CaWO$\_4$ target detectors. This corresponds to a signal-to-background ratio $\gtrsim$ 1, and therefore meets the required specifications in terms of particle background rejection for the detection of reactor antineutrinos through CE$\nu$NS.

2025-09-03, **Boomerang mechanism explaining the excess radio background**, Bhupal Dev et.al., [2509.03441v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03441v1)

 We propose a {\em boomerang mechanism} for the explanation of the excess radio background detected by ARCADE. In an early stage, at a temperature $T \sim 100\,{\rm keV}$, a fraction of relic neutrinos is resonantly converted into dark neutrinos by mixing induced by a pre-existing lepton asymmetry. Dark neutrinos decay much later into a dark photon, mixed with photon, and a dark fermion, with a lifetime longer than the age of the Universe, as required by a solution to the excess radio background. This scenario circumvents the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment but still implies a testable lower bound.

2025-09-03, **Improved limit on the effective electron neutrino mass with the ECHo-1k experiment**, Fabienne Adam et.al., [2509.03423v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03423v1)

 The effective electron neutrino mass can be determined by analyzing the endpoint region of the $^{163}$Ho electron capture spectrum, provided a measurement with high energy resolution and high statistics using calorimetric techniques. Here, the Electron Capture in $^{163}$Ho collaboration, ECHo, presents an analysis of the most precise $^{163}$Ho spectrum currently available, obtained with the ECHo-1k experiment and comprising about 200 million events. A very low background rate of $B=9.1(1.3)\times 10^{-6}$ /eV/pixel/day was achieved allowing for a reliable analysis of the endpoint region. The derived endpoint energy $Q = 2862(4)$ eV is in excellent agreement with the one independently determined via Penning-trap mass spectrometry of $Q=2863.2(6)$ eV [1]. The upper limit of the effective electron neutrino mass is improved by almost a factor 2 compared to the lowest current value [2], reaching $m\_{\nu\_\mathrm{e}} < 15 $ eV/c${^2}$ (90\% credible interval).

2025-09-03, **Two-sector leptogenesis in a two-Higgs-doublet model with spontaneous CP violation**, Debashree Priyadarsini Das et.al., [2509.03227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03227v1)

 The extension of the Standard Model (SM) field content with one inert Higgs doublet (IHD) and three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) is a well-motivated approach. The key advantages of the model include the appearance of a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) like dark matter (DM) candidate from the neutral component of the IHD, along with the plausible explanation of the sub-eV mass range of SM neutrinos via the radiative seesaw mechanism. Additionally, the decay of RHNs can contextualize the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis and is intricately connected to CP violation. Also, given the ongoing searches for light scalars at various experimental facilities, the extended Higgs sector of the model continues to be at the forefront. However, this scotogenic framework encounters a deficiency in providing the observed amount of relic density for a particular mass range $\sim (80 - 500) $ GeV of its DM candidate, hence requiring further augmentation. Also, the WIMP scenarios have not yet resulted in conclusive hints at the direct detection experiments. In this context, our work is based on further extension of the above Scotogenic model by a dark sector. Additionally, considering the cosmic coincidence aspect, we operate within the framework of two-sector leptogenesis. To have a predictive flavor structure in the visible sector, we impose $A\_4$ symmetry. Also, we adhere to spontaneous CP violation via complex vacuum expectation value of the falvon field, leading to a situation where there is only one CP-violating phase as a common connection between the visible and dark sectors. In our analysis, we find for the lightest RHN mass $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV, our results are in good agreement with the observational ratio of relic densities, i.e., $\Omega\_{\rm DM}/\Omega\_{\rm b} \sim 5$ for a few GeV range of mass of the dark sector DM candidate.

2025-09-03, **Wave-particle duality and entanglement in neutrino oscillation**, Rajrupa Benerjee et.al., [2509.03089v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03089v1)

 We analyze neutrino oscillations from the perspective of quantum complementarity by extending the familiar wave-particle duality into a exact triality relation among visibility, predictability, and entanglement. Using a density-matrix approach, we construct explicit measures of these quantities in both two- and three-flavor frameworks and show that they satisfy an exact conservation-like identity throughout oscillation evolution. In this picture, visibility corresponds to interference strength, predictability to flavor imbalance, and entanglement to the reduction of purity due to flavor correlations. We demonstrate that neutrino oscillations naturally exhibit regimes of maximal entanglement, vanishing coherence, and entanglement monogamy constraining flavor correlations. Our results establish that long-baseline neutrino oscillations realize the triality relation in an energy-dependent way, with T2K probing vacuum-like coherence entanglement balance and DUNE revealing the decisive role of matter e ects in redistributing the quantum information budget.

2025-09-03, **A Study on the Triggering of Nucleonic Direct Urca Processes in Neutron Stars of Specific Masses and Their Hyperon Dependence**, Yan Xu et.al., [2509.02988v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02988v2)

 This work aims to analyze how hyperons affect neutrino radiation properties in nucleonic direct URCA processes, expecting to provide useful references for finding evidence of the existence of hyperons in astronomical observations. This analysis is carried out using the GM1 and NL3 parameter sets under the SU(6) and SU(3) flavor symmetries in the relativistic mean field theory framework. Combined with the inferred mass and radius values of PSRs J1231-1411, J0030+0451, and J0740+6620, our results show that nucleonic direct Urca processes are absent in PSR J1231-1411 due to momentum conservation violation. In hyperon-containing PSR J0030+0451 (NL3 parameter set), the nucleonic direct Urca processes involving $e^{-}$/ $\mu^{-}$ would occur. A large inferred mass span induces hyperon fraction variations, affecting neutrino emissivity. If the inferred mass of PSR J0030+0451 exceeds approximately 1.8 $M\_{\odot}$, the neutrino luminosity of the nucleonic direct Urca processes under the SU(3) flavor symmetry remains nearly the same as that in npe$\mu$ matter, without depending on hyperons. However, it exhibits an obvious hyperon dependence under the SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry. For hyperon-containing J0740+6620, the nucleonic direct Urca processes under the SU(3) flavor symmetry in GM1 parameter set predicts faster neutrino luminosity decline with hyperonic fraction than npe$\mu$ matter, and under the SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry in NL3 parameter set it shows monotonic decreasing trend. The research shows that hyperonic fraction significantly affect the neutrino radiation properties of the nucleonic direct URCA processes in neutron stars. Different-mass pulsars (e.g., PSRs J1231-1411, J0030+0451, J0740+6620) exhibit the distinct nucleonic direct URCA processes behaviors, dependent on inferred masses/radii, parameter sets, and theoretical models.

2025-09-04, **Renormalization-Free Galaxy Bias in Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory**, Naonori Sugiyama et.al., [2509.04142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04142v1)

 We present a renormalization-free framework for modeling galaxy bias based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). In this approach, the biased density fluctuation is built solely from Galileon-type operators associated with the intrinsic nonlinear growth of dark matter. This ensures the bias expansion is well defined at the field level, automatically satisfies statistical conditions of vanishing ensemble and volume averages, and removes the need for ad hoc renormalization. We derive analytic one-loop expressions for the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter power spectra and implement an efficient numerical algorithm using \texttt{FFTLog} and \texttt{FAST-PT}, enabling rapid and accurate evaluation. The model requires only a minimal set of bias parameters: three parameters are sufficient to describe correlation functions in configuration space, while four parameters are needed for power spectra in Fourier space. To test accuracy, we jointly fit halo auto- and cross-spectra from the \textit{Dark Emulator}, covering nine redshift-mass combinations with 100 cosmologies each. A single set of bias parameters reproduces both spectra within $\sim1\%$ up to $k \simeq 0.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for typical linear bias $b\_1 \sim 0.8$-2, and to $k \simeq 0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $b\_1 \sim 3$. The same parameters also match two-point correlation functions down to $r \simeq 15\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. Moreover, ULPT predicts the relation $b\_{K^2}^{\mathrm{E}} = -\tfrac{3}{4} b\_2^{\mathrm{E}}$, validated against $N$-body results. These results demonstrate that ULPT provides a physically consistent and efficient model for nonlinear galaxy bias, with applications to redshift-space distortions, bispectra, and reconstruction. The numerical implementation is released as the open-source Python package https://github.com/naonori/ulptkit.

2025-09-04, **Primordial black holes versus their impersonators at gravitational wave observatories**, Andrea Begnoni et.al., [2509.04028v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04028v1)

 The detection of primordial black holes (PBHs) would mark a major breakthrough, with far-reaching implications for early universe cosmology, fundamental physics, and the nature of dark matter. Gravitational wave observations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and properties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes that can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling signal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact object (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can produce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this work, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space, including binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter equations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation gravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We compute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\geq 3\sigma$) detections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing quantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various observational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors will be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of $z \sim 3$. For heavier objects with masses up to $M \lesssim 2 M\_\odot$, we show that PBHs can be distinguished from neutron stars via their lack of tidal effects up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.2$.

2025-09-04, **Shadow and Quasi-Normal Modes of Schwarzschild-Hernquist Black Hole**, Xing-Hui Feng et.al., [2509.04001v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04001v1)

 In this paper we study the shadow and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a black hole (BH) surrounded by a dark matter halo with Hernquist-type density distribution, which was reported in Ref. \cite{Cardoso:2021wlq}. In astrophysical scenarios, we find that the shadow radius enlarges as the compactness of halo increases. Therefore, we obtain an upper bound for the compactness ${\cal C}\le0.092$ with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. We calculate axial gravitational QNMs of the galactic BH up to ${\cal C}\sim{\cal O}(1)$, and fit the redshift relative to Schwarzschild QNMs up to second order in the compactness (for ${\cal C}\le0.3)$. These highly redshifted QNMs, resulting from large compactness, are key to modeling the dark matter halo.

 I present in this article how non-classical features in the local axion dark matter state may imprint on cavity haloscopes. Example signatures from squeezed and pair-entangled DM states are presented and their potential for sensitivity enhancements of experimental searches attuned to these signatures compared to traditional classical field signatures are discussed.

2025-09-04, **Stability analysis of two-fluid neutron stars featuring twin star and ultradense configurations**, Ankit Kumar et.al., [2509.03862v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03862v1)

 We perform a detailed analysis of radial oscillations to discuss dynamical stability in two-fluid neutron stars composed of ordinary nuclear matter and a gravitationally coupled dark matter component. Using a fully relativistic two-fluid formalism, we solve the eigenvalue problem for a coupled system of equations with small-amplitude radial perturbations and derive the critical line corresponding to stability boundaries. We also compare these stability boundary lines obtained from the radial perturbations with those obtained from a generalized turning-point criterion based on extremization of mass and particle numbers, and find that the two methods agree to within better than $1\%$ across the parameter space explored. We consider both mirror dark matter and self-interacting fermionic dark matter models, and examine how microphysical properties$-$such as nuclear equations of state, dark matter mass, and vector coupling strength$-$reshape the topology of the stability boundary and gravitational mass contours. Our results reveal the emergence of ultra-dense and compact stars, with nuclear central densities exceeding single-fluid instability thresholds by factors of two or more, and the appearance of twin-star configurations with identical masses but distinct radii and internal fluid compositions. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of neutron star observables and motivate future studies involving phase transitions, density discontinuities, or additional interactions in multi-component stellar systems. In particular, the emergence of exotic stable configurations beyond conventional stability limits underscores the need to reassess standard criteria in light of multi-fluid dynamics, with significant consequences for multimessenger probes of dense matter$-$including gravitational wave signals, mass-radius constraints, and post-merger remnants.

2025-09-04, **Confirming lensed-quasar candidates with DESI and P200 spectroscopy I. 14 lensed quasars and 8 lensed galaxy**, Zizhao He et.al., [2509.03858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03858v1)

 Lensed quasars are powerful probes of cosmology, the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, and the distribution of dark matter. We cross-match 1,724 previously identified candidates from HSC, KiDS, and the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS) with DESI DR1, obtaining 937 DESI spectra for 677 unique systems. Combining DESI spectroscopy with observations from the Palomar 200-inch Double Spectrograph (P200/DBSP), we confirm three lensed quasars with source redshifts of 1.71, 1.93, and 3.23 and Einstein radii of 0.96, 0.39, and 1.07 arcsec, respectively. We further identify 11 high-confidence candidates that are well reproduced by a simple singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, exhibit lens galaxies in the image modeling, and have at least one available spectrum; across these, the Einstein radius spans 0.39 to 2.34 arcsec and the source redshift spans 1.13 to 2.88. In 8 of the 11 cases, the systems already satisfy our lensing criteria except that only one quasar image currently has a spectrum; obtaining a second spectrum for the other image would enable immediate confirmation. As by-products, we report eight new lensed galaxies spanning galaxy- to group-scale lenses. These results provide valuable targets for follow-up studies and underscore the efficiency of wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as DESI in confirming gravitationally lensed quasars and galaxies.

 We present constraints on low mass dark matter-electron scattering and absorption interactions using a SuperCDMS high-voltage eV-resolution (HVeV) detector. Data were taken underground in the NEXUS facility located at Fermilab with an overburden of 225 meters of water equivalent. The experiment benefits from the minimizing of luminescence from the printed circuit boards in the detector holder used in all previous HVeV studies. A blind analysis of $6.1\,\mathrm{g\cdot days}$ of exposure produces exclusion limits for dark matter-electron scattering cross-sections for masses as low as $1\,\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$, as well as on the photon-dark photon mixing parameter and the coupling constant between axion-like particles and electrons for particles with masses $>1.2\,\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ probed via absorption processes.

 It is well-known that exotic compact objects (ECOs) are a class of objects categorised as Black Hole (BH) mimickers. ECOs have been shown to possess signatures distinguishing them from BHs. However, in our universe, no object exists in complete isolation. Consequently, any compact object, whether a BH or an ECO, must reside within some environment that inevitably influences the surrounding spacetime geometry due to back-reaction. In this paper, we investigate a scenario where an ECO is embedded in an environment of dark matter (DM). In this work, we assume two different models of the DM halo profile. We compute the Love numbers and GW echoes of this composite system to assess the impact of the surrounding dark matter halo. To analyze the echoes, we focus on odd-parity perturbations, while for calculating the tidal Love numbers, we consider both even and odd parity perturbations. We aim to understand how the DM properties couple to the ECO signatures in the Love number or the GW-echo signal, both of which have a strong bearing as observables in future-generation detectors.

2025-09-03, **Influence of Perfect Fluid Dark Matter on Shadow Observables of Yang-Mills modified charged black holes**, Md Sabir Ali et.al., [2509.03507v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03507v1)

 We investigate the influence of perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) on Yang--Mills--inspired charged black holes, with a particular focus on the resulting modifications to key black hole observables. By embedding a PFDM term into the spacetime geometry, we examine the alterations in shadow morphology, photon geodesics, and the associated energy emission spectra. Our analysis reveals that PFDM induces notable deviations in the shadow size, shape, and circularity, and significantly impacts the stability of circular orbits. Furthermore, the energy emission rate exhibits a strong dependence on both the Yang--Mills charge and the dark matter distribution. These results indicate that environmental effects arising from dark matter can imprint observable signatures on black hole shadows and radiation processes, offering a potential pathway to constrain dark matter models and probe non-Kerr geometries with forthcoming high-precision observations such as those from the Event Horizon Telescope and next-generation interferometers.

2025-09-03, **Probing Heavy Dark Matter in Red Giants**, Sougata Ganguly et.al., [2509.03388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03388v1)

 Red giants (RGs) provide a promising astrophysical environment for capturing dark matter (DM) via elastic scattering with stellar nuclei. Captured DM particles migrate toward the helium-rich core and accumulate into a compact configuration. As the DM population grows, it can become self-gravitating and undergo gravitational collapse, leading to adiabatic contraction through interactions with the ambient medium. The resulting energy release, through elastic scattering and, where relevant, DM annihilation during collapse, locally heats the stellar core and can trigger helium ignition earlier than that predicted by standard stellar evolution. We analyze the conditions under which DM-induced heating leads to runaway helium burning and identify the critical DM mass required for ignition. Imposing the observational constraint that helium ignition must not occur before the observed luminosity at the tip of the RG branch, we translate these conditions into bounds on DM properties. Remarkably, we find that RGs are sensitive to DM, particularly with masses around $10^{11} \,{\rm GeV}$ and spin-independent scattering cross sections near $10^{-37}\,{\rm cm}^2$, which is comparable to the reach of current terrestrial direct detection experiments.

2025-09-03, **A two-phase model of galaxy formation: IV. Seeding and growing supermassive black holes in dark matter halos**, Yangyao Chen et.al., [2509.03283v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03283v1)

 We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark-matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\rm H}\_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M\_{\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\,{\rm M}\_\odot$ at $z \approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\,{\rm M}\_\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M\_{\rm BH}$-$M\_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of `little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.

2025-09-03, **Amplified capture rate of dark matter in compact binaries and constraints on bosonic dark matter from GW170817**, JÃ¡nos TakÃ¡tsy et.al., [2509.03272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03272v1)

 The accretion of dark matter (DM) onto compact objects and the potential gravitational collapse of neutron stars due to this accretion has become a promising indirect probe of DM properties, complementing terrestrial experiments. We show that the accretion flux of DM on stellar objects is amplified in binary systems due to the complex gravitational interaction of said particles with the binary. We perform few-body Monte Carlo simulations to show that this amplification factor is $\sim4-5$ for circular binaries, small DM velocity dispersions and mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.3$. We use this factor to improve previous constraints on the scattering cross section of non-annihilating bosonic DM with baryonic matter, and derive upper bounds on this cross section from the observation of the binary NS merger associated with GW170817. We also show that the maximally accretable mass fraction of DM by binary NSs is $\lesssim10^{-3}$, even for extreme DM densities only possible in DM spikes, due to the dynamical friction exerted by the ambient DM.

2025-09-03, **Tidally induced bar-like galaxies in simulated clusters**, Ewa L. Lokas et.al., [2509.03184v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03184v1)

 One of the scenarios for bar formation in galaxies involves their interaction with a more massive companion. The stellar component is then transformed from a disk into a bar-like prolate spheroid. I investigated a subsample of 77 bar-like galaxies tidally induced in the cluster environment, selected among the previously studied sample of bar-like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations. I present six clear, convincing examples of bar-like galaxies formed after an interaction with a progenitor of a massive brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and describe the properties of their bars. For the whole sample, the time of bar formation is strongly correlated with and typically slightly greater than the time of the pericenter passage. All galaxies are strongly stripped of dark matter and gas, and their rotation is similarly diminished. A larger pericenter distance typically requires a higher host mass in order to transform the galaxy, but the interactions show no preference for prograde configurations. The final strength of the bars does not correlate with the amount of tidal stripping experienced because of the variety of initial properties of the progenitors and the subsequent evolution over the next pericenter passages. In spite of difficulties in the interpretation of some cases involving mergers and multiple interactions, the results confirm in the cosmological context the reality of tidal bar formation in cluster environments previously studied using controlled simulations.

2025-09-03, **The slow evolution of dark matter halos from cusp to core naturally produces extended stellar core-like distributions**, Jorge Sanchez Almeida et.al., [2509.03167v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03167v1)

 Motivated by the observation of extended stellar cores in dark matter (DM) dominated dwarf galaxies, this study investigates a simple mechanism by which stellar cores can form as a result of DM halo expansion. Several non-CDM models predict that the DM distribution thermalizes over time, transforming initially cuspy halos into cores. This transformation weakens the gravitational potential, allowing the stellar component to expand and form diffuse, core-like structures. Using analytical models and adiabatic invariants, we examine stellar systems with purely tangential, purely radial, and isotropic orbits evolving under a slowly changing potential. Across a wide range of initial and final conditions, we find that stellar cores form relatively easily, though their properties depend sensitively on these conditions. Orbit types preserve their nature during the DM halo expansion: tangential and radial orbits remain so, while isotropic orbits remain nearly isotropic in the central regions. Systems with circular orbits develop stellar cores when the initial stellar density logarithmic slope lies between -0.5 and -1.2, whereas radial systems do not form cores. Isotropic systems behave similarly to tangential ones, producing cores that are isotropic in the center but develop increasing radial anisotropy outward; the anisotropy parameter "beta" grows from sim 0.07 at the core radius to sim 0.5 at three core radii. The theoretical and observational literature suggests initial DM profiles with steep slopes and stellar distributions that are shallower and isotropic at the center. Given these conditions, the mechanism predicts stellar cores with radii at least 40 % that of the DM core and inner logarithmic slopes shallower than 0.6.

2025-09-03, **PatchNet: A hierarchical approach for neural field-level inference from Quijote Simulations**, Anirban Bairagi et.al., [2509.03165v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03165v1)

 \textit{What is the cosmological information content of a cubic Gigaparsec of dark matter? } Extracting cosmological information from the non-linear matter distribution has high potential to tighten parameter constraints in the era of next-generation surveys such as Euclid, DESI, and the Vera Rubin Observatory. Traditional approaches relying on summary statistics like the power spectrum and bispectrum, though analytically tractable, fail to capture the full non-Gaussian and non-linear structure of the density field. Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) provides a powerful alternative by learning directly from forward-modeled simulations. In this work, we apply SBI to the \textit{Quijote} dark matter simulations and introduce a hierarchical method that integrates small-scale information from field sub-volumes or \textit{patches} with large-scale statistics such as power spectrum and bispectrum. This hybrid strategy is efficient both computationally and in terms of the amount of training data required. It overcomes the memory limitations associated with full-field training. We show that our approach enhances Fisher information relative to analytical summaries and matches that of a very different approach (wavelet-based statistics), providing evidence that we are estimating the full information content of the dark matter density field at the resolution of $\sim 7.8~\mathrm{Mpc}/h$.

2025-09-03, **A MUltiwavelength Study of ELAN Environments (AMUSE$^2$): The Impact of Dense Environment on Massive Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies at Cosmic Noon**, Yu-Jan Wang et.al., [2509.03027v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03027v1)

 To understand how massive galaxies are influenced by their surroundings, we present new ALMA and NOEMA observations as part of A MUltiwavelength Study of ELAN Environments (AMUSE$^2$). These observations target submillimeter sources discovered in single-dish surveys around nine quasars hosting Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at $z=2\sim3$, including two Enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe). Through detection of mid-$J$ CO lines, we confirm physical associations of 15 SMGs, which are located outside the expected virial radii of the central dark-matter halos hosting the quasars. We find $73^{+29}\_{-21}\%$ of SMGs have line profiles better described by double Gaussian models, with a median peak-to-peak separation of 350 $\pm$ 25 km/s, suggesting rotating disks or interacting pairs. Modified blackbody fits of the far-infrared photometry yield a median $\beta$ of 2.0 $\pm$ 0.2 and $T\_{dust}$ of 34 $\pm$ 3 K. Overall, SMGs outside quasar halos share similar physical properties with those in the field, but combining data from other studies reveals depleted gas fractions within quasar halos. This suggests that dense environments significantly impact massive star-forming galaxies only within halo scales at cosmic noon. Additionally, spatial analyses of 15 SMGs indicate they trace large-scale structures, possibly filamentary or elongated pancake-like, with a scale height of 2-5\,cMpc. Our measured distributions and densities of star-formation rates align with models, though likely represent lower limits.

2025-09-03, **Observational challenges to holographic and Ricci dark energy paradigms: Insights from ACT DR6 and DESI DR2**, Peng-Ju Wu et.al., [2509.02945v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02945v1)

 Recent studies suggest that dark energy may be dynamical rather than being a mere cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In this work, we examine the viability of two physically well-motivated dynamical dark energy models -- holographic dark energy (HDE) and Ricci dark energy (RDE) -- by confronting them with the latest observational data, including ACT cosmic microwave background anisotropies, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESY5 supernovae. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension between early- and late-universe constraints within both frameworks: ACT favors a quintom scenario where the dark energy equation of state (EoS) evolves from $w>-1$ at early times to $w<-1$ at late times, while DESI+DESY5 exhibits a distinct preference for quintessence where $w>-1$ across cosmic evolution. The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely with the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a coherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even exceeding $10\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter reconstructions. Based on the combined data, Bayesian evidence decisively disfavors both HDE and RDE models relative to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, with ACT providing decisive disfavor and DESI+DESY5 yielding moderate disfavor. Our results show that the HDE and RDE models remain excluded by the new data, reinforcing earlier conclusions drawn from previous datasets.

 The age of the Local Bubble (LB) can be used to constrain the timescales, on which the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood is evolving. Previous estimates have put the age of the LB at $\gtrsim 14\,\text{Myr}$, and suggested that its expansion was powered by $\sim 15-20$ SNe, yet in a companion paper we have seen hints that this age might be too high. Following up on these hints, we aim to place new constraints on the age of the LB. We reconstruct the geometry and momentum of the LB using publicly available 3D dust maps to compare its geometry to that of the high-quality sample of simulated supernova remnants in the SISSI project. We find that, in contrast to previous estimates, $\gtrsim 20$ SNe over $\sim 4\,\text{Myr}$ are required to explain both the momentum and the size of the LB. The julia source-code for our analysis is made available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17054923. Previous estimates of the age of the LB have seemingly overestimated its age and underestimated the number of SNe powering its expansion. Our results are in tension with the assumption that the LB is powered solely by SNe associated with the nearby Scorpius-Centraurus OB association, which appears to have stopped forming stars at about the same time as the LB began to expand. In light of this new evidence, our results cast serious doubts on the claim that star formation in the solar neighborhood was driven by the expansion of the LB, and might have instead quenched it.

2025-09-04, **Evidence of the pair instability gap in the distribution of black hole masses**, Hui Tong et.al., [2509.04151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04151v1)

 Stellar theory predicts a forbidden range of black-hole masses between ${\sim}50$--$130\,M\_\odot$ due to pair-instability supernovae, but evidence for such a gap in the mass distribution from gravitational-wave astronomy has proved elusive. Early hints of a cutoff in black-hole masses at ${\sim} 45\,M\_\odot$ disappeared with the subsequent discovery of more massive binary black holes. Here, we report evidence of the pair-instability gap in LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA's fourth gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC-4), with a lower boundary of $45\_{-4}^{+5} M\_\odot$ (90\% credibility). While the gap is not present in the distribution of \textit{primary} masses $m\_1$ (the bigger of the two black holes in a binary system), it appears unambiguously in the distribution of \textit{secondary} masses $m\_2$, where $m\_2 \leq m\_1$. The location of the gap lines up well with a previously identified transition in the binary black-hole spin distribution; binaries with primary components in the gap tend to spin more rapidly than those below the gap. We interpret these findings as evidence for a subpopulation of hierarchical mergers: binaries where the primary component is the product of a previous black-hole merger and thus populates the gap. Our measurement of the location of the pair-instability gap constrains the $S$-factor for $^{12}\rm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\rm{O}$ at 300keV to $256\_{-104}^{+197}$ keV barns.

 The remnant of the historical supernova SN 1181 is under discussion: While the previously suggested G130.7+3.1 (3C58) appears too old (3000-5000 yr), the unusual star IRAS 00500+6713 with a surrounding nebula (Pa-30) has an expansion age not inconsistent with a SN Iax explosion in AD 1181 under the assumption that neither acceleration nor deceleration occurred. Previously, only reports from China and Japan were known, pointing to an event near the northern circumpolar region. Any further reports from other cultures can therefore be highly relevant. We present here an Arabic poem in praise of Saladin by the contemporaneous author Ibn San\=a' al-Mulk (Cairo, Egypt). We re-date its composition to between Dec 1181 and May 1182. It contains a new bright star, which can be identified as SN 1181. The poem also provides new and independent information on the object type (called `najm' for `star'), location on sky (in or near the Arabic constellation al-Kaff al-Khab\=ib, lit. the henna-dyed hand (five bright stars in Cassiopeia), and brightness (brighter than alpha Cas, 2.25 mag). In addition, we present another Arabic text on SN 1006, also from Cairo, by the historian al-Maqr\=iz\=i, probably based on the contemporaneous al-Musabbih\=i

2025-09-04, **ZTF SNe Ia DR2: Towards cosmology-grade ZTF supernova light curves using scene modeling photometry**, L. Lacroix et.al., [2509.04073v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04073v1)

 The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is conducting a wide-field survey of the northern sky in three optical bands and the collaboration cosmology working group has released 3628 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered during its first 2.5 years of operation. This "ZTF SN Ia DR2" sample is the largest SN Ia dataset to date.   Fully exploiting this dataset to improve understanding of the properties of dark energy requires a photometric accuracy of O(0.1%). This can be achieved using Scene Modeling Photometry (SMP), which is optimal to extract a transient signal (SN) from a complex background (its host), while ensuring a common flux estimator with nearby stars used as calibration reference. In this paper, we present the status of the SMP development and use it to assess the precision and accuracy of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 force photometry light curves.   We reach a repeatability of the star observations better than 1%. However, we have identified a new sensor effect, dubbed "pocket-effect", which distorts the Point Spread Function (PSF) in a flux-dependent manner leading to non-linearities in the photometry of a few percent. Correcting for this effect requires time- and sensor-dependent corrections to be applied at the pixel level, which is currently under development. This effects affects all light curve releases to date -- both from forced photometry and scene modelling preventing ZTF SN Ia DR2 to be used for accurate cosmological inference.   Comparing the SMP and forced photometry measurements, we find that stretch and color estimated from both processings are consistent, aside from a 10 mmag shift in color. This assess the robustness of results presented as part of the the ZTF SN Ia DR2 release. The absolute calibration however shifts by 90 mmag. A reprocessing of the full ZTF SN Ia DR2 dataset using the SMP method is currently in progress.

 We present the calibration of stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in the subgrid model for the new COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. COLIBRE directly simulates the multi-phase interstellar medium and the evolution of dust grains, which is coupled to the chemistry. COLIBRE is calibrated at three resolutions: particle masses of $m\_{\rm gas} \approx m\_{\rm dm} \sim 10^7$ (m7), $10^6$ (m6), and $10^5~\mathrm{M\_\odot}$ (m5). To calibrate the COLIBRE feedback at m7 resolution, we run Latin hypercubes of $\approx 200$ simulations that vary up to four subgrid parameters in cosmological volumes of ($50~\mathrm{cMpc}$)$^{3}$. We train Gaussian process emulators on these simulations to predict the $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and size - stellar mass relation (SSMR) as functions of the model parameters, which we then fit to observations. The trained emulators not only provide the best-fitting parameter values but also enable us to investigate how different aspects of the prescriptions for supernova and AGN feedback affect the predictions. In particular, we demonstrate that while the observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR can be matched individually with a relatively simple supernova feedback model, simultaneously reproducing both necessitates a more sophisticated prescription. We show that the calibrated m7 COLIBRE model not only reproduces the calibration target observables, but also matches various other galaxy properties to which the model was not calibrated. Finally, we apply the calibrated m7 model to the m6 and m5 resolutions and, after slight manual adjustments of the subgrid parameters, achieve a similar level of agreement with the observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR.

 Precision photometric calibration is key to a number of astrophysical research areas such as supernova cosmology and dark energy studies. In the age of large surveys, pushing the limits of photometry is a worthy challenge, with traditional celestial calibrators limited to approximately percent precision. Here we present PANDORA, a novel calibration source that achieves sub-percent photometric precision across the optical spectrum with a selectable dynamic range and high optical efficiency. Building on proven collimated beam projector designs for relative throughput calibration of survey telescopes, PANDORA is capable of delivering photons anywhere in the 350-1100 nm spectral range. It uses selectable neutral density filters and sequential NIST-calibrated photodiode feedback to internally self-calibrate prior to operation, and is illuminated by an Energetiq EQ-99X-FC broadband laser-driven light source. We present here an overview of the system design, operation, and laboratory characterization results. PANDORA will begin science operations this year to support the upcoming LS4 survey on the ESO 1m Schmidt telescope.

 We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2019hnl. Discovered within ~26 hr of explosion by the ATLAS survey, SN 2019hnl is a typical Type IIP supernova with a peak absolute V band magnitude of -16.7+-0.1 mag, a plateau length of ~107 days, and an early decline rate of 0.0086+-0.0006 mag (50 days)^-1. We use nebular spectroscopy and hydrodynamic modeling with the SNEC, MESA, and STELLA codes to infer that the progenitor of SN 2019hnl was a M\_ZAMS ~ 11M\_solar red supergiant which produced 0.047+-0.007M\_solar of 56Ni in the explosion. As a part of our hydrodynamic modeling, we reduced hydrogen envelope mass by scaling the mass loss within the "Dutch" wind scheme to fit our light curve, showing that the progenitor of a relatively typical Type IIP SN may experience partial stripping during their evolution and establish massive (~0.2M\_solar) CSM environments prior to core collapse.

 We present constraints on models of cosmology and astrophysics using cosmic shear data vectors from three datasets: the northern and southern Galactic cap of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) project, and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. These data vectors combined consist of 270 million galaxies spread across 13,000 ${\rm deg}^2$ of the sky. We first extract constraints for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find $S\_8= 0.805^{+0.019}\_{-0.019}$ and $\Omega\_{\rm m} = 0.262^{+0.023}\_{-0.036}$, which is consistent within $1.9 \sigma$ of constraints from the Planck satellite. Extending our analysis to dynamical dark energy models shows that lensing provides some (but still minor) improvements to existing constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations. Finally, we study six different models for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum. We show the different models provide consistent constraints on baryon suppression, and associated cosmology, once the astrophysical priors are sufficiently wide. Current scale-cut approaches for mitigating baryon contamination result in a residual bias of $\approx 0.3\sigma$ in the $S\_8, \Omega\_{\rm m}$ posterior. Using all scales with dedicated baryon modeling leads to negligible improvement as the new information is used solely to self-calibrate the baryon model on small scales. Additional non-lensing datasets, and/or calibrations of the baryon model, will be required to access the full statistical power of the lensing measurements. The combined dataset in this work represents the largest lensing dataset to date (most galaxies, largest area) and provides an apt testing ground for analyses of upcoming datasets from Stage IV surveys. The DECADE shear catalogs, data vectors, and likelihoods are made publicly available.

2025-09-03, **A Galactic Perspective on the (Unremarkable) Relative Refractory Depletion Observed in the Sun**, Rayna Rampalli et.al., [2509.03577v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03577v1)

 Over the last two decades, the Sun has been observed to be depleted in refractory elements as a function of elemental condensation temperature (\tcond) relative to $\sim 80\%$ of its counterparts. We assess the impact of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) on refractory element--\tcond\ trends for 109,500 unique solar analogs from the GALAH, APOGEE, Gaia RVS, and \cite{bedell18} surveys. We find that a star's \feh\ and \alphafe\ are indicators of its \tcond\ slope (\rsq\ = $15 \pm 5$, $23 \pm 10\%$ respectively) while \teff\ and \logg\ contribute more weakly (\rsq\ = $9 \pm 5$, $13 \pm 16\%$). The Sun's abundance pattern resembles that of more metal-rich (0.1 dex) and $\alpha$-depleted stars ($-0.02$ dex), suggesting a connection to broader GCE trends. To more accurately model stars' nucleosynthetic signatures, we apply the K-process model from \cite{Griffith24}, which casts each star's abundance pattern as a linear combination of core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae contributions. We find the Sun appears chemically ordinary in this framework, lying within $0.5\sigma$ of the expected solar analog abundance distribution. We show that refractory element--\tcond\ trends arise because elements with higher \tcond\ have higher contributions from core-collapse supernovae. Refractory element depletion trends primarily reflect nucleosynthetic enrichment patterns shaped by GCE and local ISM inhomogeneities, with these processes accounting for $93\%$ of the observed variation within 2$\sigma$. This work highlights how abundance diversity due to local and global chemical enrichment may often mask and mimic population-scale signatures of planet-related processes.

2025-09-03, **The role of peculiar velocity uncertainties in standard siren cosmology**, Chris Blake et.al., [2509.03101v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03101v1)

 Local distance indicators such as standard sirens, in combination with spectroscopic redshift measurements of their host galaxies, allow us to estimate the present-day expansion rate of the Universe parameterised by Hubble's constant, H\_0. However, these observed redshifts are systematically modified by the effect of galaxy peculiar velocities. Although these velocities may be estimated from the local density field by the process of velocity-field reconstruction, the intrinsic errors and covariance in these estimates contribute to the error in the H\_0 determination. In this paper we demonstrate how the impact of peculiar velocities can be propagated into H\_0 measurements from local distance indicators with observed redshifts, incorporating the full covariance of the velocity field induced by bulk flows. We apply our methods to cosmological simulations, testing the importance of this effect in the context of future analyses of gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts used as bright sirens. We conclude that H\_0 errors may be increased by up to a factor of 2 in comparison with neglecting peculiar velocity covariance, with the highest impacts expected for sources at nearby distances or with small distance errors. Our analytical methods may also be applied to other local distance indicators, such as Type Ia supernovae.

 Recent studies suggest that dark energy may be dynamical rather than being a mere cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In this work, we examine the viability of two physically well-motivated dynamical dark energy models -- holographic dark energy (HDE) and Ricci dark energy (RDE) -- by confronting them with the latest observational data, including ACT cosmic microwave background anisotropies, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESY5 supernovae. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension between early- and late-universe constraints within both frameworks: ACT favors a quintom scenario where the dark energy equation of state (EoS) evolves from $w>-1$ at early times to $w<-1$ at late times, while DESI+DESY5 exhibits a distinct preference for quintessence where $w>-1$ across cosmic evolution. The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely with the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a coherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even exceeding $10\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter reconstructions. Based on the combined data, Bayesian evidence decisively disfavors both HDE and RDE models relative to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, with ACT providing decisive disfavor and DESI+DESY5 yielding moderate disfavor. Our results show that the HDE and RDE models remain excluded by the new data, reinforcing earlier conclusions drawn from previous datasets.
