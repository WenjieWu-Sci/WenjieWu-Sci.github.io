2025-09-18, **Lepton models from non-holomorphic $A^{\prime}_{5}$ modular flavor symmetry**, Cai-Chang Li et.al., [2509.15183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15183v1)

 In the framework of non-holomorphic modular invariance approach, we have systematically constructed all minimal lepton models based on the non-holomorphic $A^{\prime}\_{5}$ modular symmetry from a bottom-up approach. In these models, the Yukawa couplings are described by polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms of integer weights at level $N=5$. Under the assumption of Majorana neutrinos, both the Weinberg operator and the type-I seesaw mechanism are considered for neutrino mass generation. All minimal models are found to be based on generalized CP (gCP) symmetry, and each of them depends on five real dimensionless parameters and two overall scales. Through comprehensive numerical scanning, we obtain 6 (4) phenomenologically viable Weinberg operator models and 94 (76) phenomenologically viable seesaw models for normal (inverted) ordering neutrino masses. For each viable model, we present predictions for key neutrino properties, such as lepton masses, CP violation phases, mixing angles, effective Majorana mass for neutrinoless double beta decay and the kinematical mass in beta decay. Furthermore, we provide detailed numerical analysis for two representative models to illustrate our results.

2025-09-18, **Hunting the elusive $X17$ in CE$ν$NS at the ESS**, Joakim Cederkäll et.al., [2509.15128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15128v1)

 The so-called $X17$ particle has been proposed in order to explain a very significant resonant behaviour (in both the angular separation and invariant mass) of $e^+e^-$ pairs produced during a nuclear transition of excited $^8$Be, $^4$He and $^{12}$C nuclei. Fits to the corresponding data point, as most probable explanation, to a spin-1 object, which is protophobic and has a mass of approximately 16.7 MeV, which then makes the $X17$ potentially observable in Coherent Elastic neutrino ($\nu$) Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) at the European Spallation Source (ESS). By adopting as theoretical framework a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a generic $U(1)'$ gauge group mixing with the hypercharge one of the latter, which can naturally accommodate the $X17$ state compliant with all available measurements from a variety of experiments, we predict that CE$\nu$NS at the ESS will constitute an effective means to probe this hypothesis, even after allowing for the inevitable systematics associated to the performance of the planned detectors therein.

2025-09-18, **Exponential quintessence with momentum coupling to dark matter**, Alkistis Pourtsidou et.al., [2509.15091v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15091v1)

 We present updated constraints on an interacting dark energy - dark matter model with pure momentum transfer, where dark energy is in the form of a quintessence scalar field with an exponential potential. We run a suite of MCMC analyses using the DESI DR2 BAO measurements, in combination with CMB data from Planck and supernovae data from DESY5. In contrast to the standard case of uncoupled quintessence, we find that values for the potential's slope parameter $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$, which are conjectured by string theory scenarios, are not excluded. If $\lambda$ is fixed to such a value, we find that the data favour the negative coupling branch of the model, which is the branch exhibiting late-time growth suppression. We also derive 95% upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses, finding $\sum m\_\nu < 0.06$ eV ($\sum m\_\nu < 0.16$ eV) when $\lambda$ is fixed (varied). Our results motivate further studies on dynamical dark energy models that obey string theory bounds and can be constrained with cosmological observations.

2025-09-18, **Constraining gamma-ray burst parameters with the first ultra-high energy neutrino event KM3-230213A**, KM3NeT Collaboration et.al., [2509.14895v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14895v1)

 Context: The detection of the highest energy neutrino observed to date by KM3NeT, with an estimated energy of 220 PeV, opens up new possibilities for the study and identification of the astrophysical sources responsible for a diffuse flux of such ultra-high-energy neutrinos, among which gamma-ray bursts are longstanding candidates.   Aims: Based on the event KM3-230213A, we derive constraints on the baryon loading and density of the surrounding environment in models of blastwaves in long-duration gamma-ray bursts.   Methods: We compute the diffuse flux from gamma-ray burst blastwaves, either expanding in a constant density interstellar medium or developing in a radially decreasing density of a wind-like environment surrounding the gamma-ray burst progenitor star, by taking into account the expected neutrino spectra and luminosity function. We use a Poisson likelihood method to constrain the blastwave model parameters by calculating the expected number of neutrino events within the 90% confidence level energy range of KM3-230213A and by using the joint exposure of KM3NeT/ARCA, IceCube and Pierre Auger.   Results: We constrain the baryon loading to be $\leq \{392, 131, 39, 13\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is inversely proportional to a varying interstellar medium particle density of $\{1, 3, 10, 30\}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the wind-like environment case, the baryon loading is $\leq \{20, 50, 100\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is proportional to the sixth power of a varying density parameter of $\{0.05, 0.06, 0.07\}$.

2025-09-18, **Diffuse emission from stochastic sources**, Anton Stall et.al., [2509.14776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14776v1)

 Diffuse emission in gamma-rays and neutrinos are produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium. Below some hundreds of TeV, the sources of these cosmic rays are most likely Galactic. Hence, observations of high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos can be used to probe the flux of cosmic rays in other parts of the Galaxy. Supernova remnants are usually considered as the prime candidate for the acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays. They inject cosmic rays in a point-like and specific time-dependent manner. As the precise positions and ages of the sources are not known, predictions must be obtained in a stochastic model. At GeV energies, the distribution of sources can be approximated with a smoothly varying spatial and temporal source density. At hundreds of TeV, however, the point-like nature matters as less sources contribute effectively due to shorter escape times. We have modelled diffuse emissions at hundreds of TeV, relevant for measurements by LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube, and the upcoming SWGO, as well as at tens of GeV, as measured by Fermi-LAT. This reveals the distinctive nature of diffuse emissions at the respective energies which can likely be used to constrain source models and locate cosmic ray sources.

2025-09-18, **The Stochastic Dissipation Model for the Steady State Neutrino and Multi-Wavelength Emission of TXS 0506+056**, Zhen-Jie Wang et.al., [2509.14587v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14587v1)

 The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been suggested to be a potential high-energy neutrino source thanks to the observations of IceCube, which found outburst-like neutrino emissions during 2014-2015 and 2017 in the transient emission search, and a $3.5\sigma$ local significance in a 10-year time-integrated search. The conventional one-zone jet model cannot explain the observed neutrino flux during outbursts due to the constraint from the X-ray flux, leading to proposals of multi-zone models (e.g. two-zone model) with multiple radiation zones. In literature, it has been shown that multi-zone models may consistently explain the high-state neutrino emission and the multi-wavelength emission of TXS 0506+056, while the quasi-steady-state long-term emission has not been well studied. In this work, we investigate a physically based model for the quasi-steady-state neutrino and electromagnetic radiation under the same framework, and successfully reproduce the multi-messenger emission of TXS 0506+056.

2025-09-18, **Linear seesaw leptogenesis before/after electroweak symmetry breaking**, Yan Shao et.al., [2509.14524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14524v1)

 The linear seesaw (LSS) model provides a natural framework for generating small neutrino masses at low energy scales, thereby offering promising testability prospects. However, in generic LSS models, the exact mass degeneracy (before the electroweak symmetry breaking) between the two sterile neutrinos that form a Dirac pair precludes the generation of CP asymmetries from their interplay, posing a significant challenge to explaining the observed baryon (or lepton) asymmetry of the Universe via the leptogenesis mechanism. In this work, we explore two well-motivated approaches to generate a suitable mass splitting for the two sterile neutrinos that form a Dirac pair, and consequently naturally realize a resonantly enhanced generation of baryon (and lepton) asymmetry. First, we demonstrate that the renormalization group evolution effects can naturally induce the desired mass splitting for the sterile neutrinos, resulting in a successful generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Second, motivated by the recent result from the EMPRESS collaboration that indicates the possible existence of a large lepton asymmetry of the Universe, we explore the possibility that a large lepton asymmetry might naturally follow from the electroweak symmetry breaking which automatically induces the desired mass splitting for the sterile neutrinos.

2025-09-18, **Parameter sensitivity of cosmic pairwise velocities in the non-linear regime of structure formation**, Jorge Enrique García-Farieta et.al., [2509.15223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15223v1)

 The peculiar velocities of dark matter tracers drive the growth of cosmic structures, providing a sensitive test of cosmological models and strengthening constraints on the nature of dark energy. In this work, we investigate the mean pairwise velocities, $v\_{12}$, of dark matter tracers as a cosmological probe in the non-linear regime of cosmic structure formation. Using N-body dark matter-only simulations, we measure $v\_{12}$ for pair separations up to 50 $h^{-1}$Mpc and model it by solving the pair conservation equation for a self-gravitating particle system, along with various prescriptions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. We quantified the sensitivity of $v\_{12}$ to variations in key cosmological parameters such as $\Omega\_{\mathrm{m}}$, $\sigma\_8$, $h$, $M\_\nu$, and $w$. Our parameter inference analysis using MCMC shows sub-11% agreement with simulation data, with notable degeneracies, particularly between $\Omega\_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma\_8$. We further compute the stable clustering crossing scale across redshifts $z=0$, $0.5$, and $1$, assessing its dependence on cosmology. Among the tested power spectrum modeling approaches, we find that the CSSTEmu emulator provides the most accurate predictions, with deviations below 5% for $r > 10$ $h^{-1}$Mpc at $z=0.5$. Our results are validated using independent simulation suites, demonstrating that our framework offers a robust method for extracting cosmological constraints from upcoming peculiar velocity data.

2025-09-18, **Shedding Light on Dark Matter at the LHC with Machine Learning**, Ernesto Arganda et.al., [2509.15121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15121v1)

 We investigate a WIMP dark matter (DM) candidate in the form of a singlino-dominated lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) within the $Z\_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. This framework gives rise to regions of parameter space where DM is obtained via co-annihilation with nearby higgsino-like electroweakinos and DM direct detection~signals are suppressed, the so-called ``blind spots". On the other hand, collider signatures remain promising due to enhanced radiative decay modes of higgsinos into the singlino-dominated LSP and a photon, rather than into leptons or hadrons. This motivates searches for radiatively decaying neutralinos, however, these signals face substantial background challenges, as the decay products are typically soft due to the small mass-splits ($\Delta m$) between the LSP and the higgsino-like coannihilation partners. We apply a data-driven Machine Learning (ML) analysis that improves sensitivity to these subtle signals, offering a powerful complement to traditional search strategies to discover a new physics scenario. Using an LHC integrated luminosity of $100~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $14~\mathrm{TeV}$, the method achieves a $5\sigma$ discovery reach for higgsino masses up to $225~\mathrm{GeV}$ with $\Delta m\!\lesssim\!12~\mathrm{GeV}$, and a $2\sigma$ exclusion up to $285~\mathrm{GeV}$ with $\Delta m\!\lesssim\!20~\mathrm{GeV}$. These results highlight the power of collider searches to probe DM candidates that remain hidden from current direct detection experiments, and provide a motivation for a search by the LHC collaborations using ML methods.

2025-09-18, **Magnetic-Field and Temperature Limits of a Kinetic-Inductance Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier**, Lucas M. Janssen et.al., [2509.15043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15043v1)

 Kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) offer broadband near-quantum-limited amplification with high saturation power. Due to the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials, KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground plane) while $\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the search for axion dark matter.

2025-09-18, **A dark energy model for coasting cosmology**, Yunliang Ren et.al., [2509.15039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15039v1)

 Coasting cosmology offers an intriguing and straightforward framework for understanding the universe. In this work, we employ the Trans-Planckian Censorship Criterion (TCC) conjecture to test the viability of the coasting cosmology and propose an entropic dark energy (EDE) model within this framework. By applying the holographic principle to constrain the dark energy density and adopting the Bekenstein entropy and Tsallis entropy as the constraining entropies of the system, we find that, in a holographic coasting cosmological framework where dark energy and dark matter evolve independently, the Tsallis entropy satisfies certain general assumptions better than the Bekenstein entropy. Thus, there may be a fundamental relationship between Tsallis entropy and dark energy. We utilize observational data from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) to constrain EDE model. The optimal Tsallis parameter obtained aligns well with theoretical expectations. To evaluate the model's fit to the observed data, we calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Kullback Information Criterion (KIC), and compare these metrics with those derived from $\Lambda$CDM, under which the model shows some improvement. Overall, this model provides a novel and simple on the evolution of the universe.

2025-09-18, **HerS-3: An Exceptional Einstein Cross Reveals a Massive Dark Matter Halo**, P. Cox et.al., [2509.14983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14983v1)

 We present a study of HerS-3, a dusty star-forming galaxy at zspec = 3.0607, which is gravitationally amplified into an Einstein cross with a fifth image of the background galaxy seen at the center of the cross. Detailed 1-mm spectroscopy and imaging with NOEMA and ALMA resolve the individual images and show that each of the five images display a series of molecular lines that have similar central velocities, unambiguously confirming that they have identical redshifts. The HST F110W image reveals a foreground lensing group of four galaxies with a photometric redshift zphot~1.0. Lens models that only include the four visible galaxies are unable to reproduce the properties of HerS-3. By adding a fifth massive component, lying south-east of the brightest galaxy of the group, the source reconstruction is able to match the peak emission, shape and orientation for each of the five images. The fact that no galaxy is detected near that position indicates the presence of a massive dark matter halo in the lensing galaxy group. In the source plane, HerS-3 appears as an infrared luminous starburst galaxy seen nearly edge-on. The serendipitous discovery of this exceptional Einstein cross offers a potential laboratory for exploring at small spatial scales a nuclear starburst at the peak of cosmic evolution and studying the properties of a massive dark matter halo associated with the lensing galaxy group.

2025-09-18, **Dark Photon Oscillations in Waveguide**, Yu-Xin Tian et.al., [2509.14962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14962v1)

 Dark photons, which can kinetically mix with ordinary photons, represent the simplest extension to the standard model. Detecting their oscillations with visible photons could provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model. We propose a novel laboratory-based approach to detect dark photon oscillations using a laser in an Optical Time-domain Relectometry (OTDR) setup. The laser light propagating through the optical fiber undergoes oscillations with the dark photon, leading to measurable changes in the power flow. These oscillations can precisely measured,   leveraging its high sensitivity and efficiency in detecting small variations in the optical signal. This approach could provide a new avenue for probing dark photon oscillations in the laboratory and greatly improve the current experimental sensitivity to dark photon in a wide mass range.

2025-09-18, **Exploring dark matter with quantum-enhanced haloscopes and time projection chambers**, David Díez-Ibáñez et.al., [2509.14897v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14897v1)

 This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy. It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies.   The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors.   Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.

2025-09-18, **Fine-grained dark matter substructure and axion haloscopes**, Ciaran A. J. O'Hare et.al., [2509.14874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14874v1)

 The velocity distribution of cold dark matter within galaxies is expected to exhibit ultra-fine-grained substructure as a result of the many foldings of an initially smooth phase-space sheet under gravity. The innumerable folds of this sheet in the inner regions of a galactic halo would appear on solar-system scales like an extremely large number of spatially overlapping streams of dark matter particles. Some of these streams may also receive amplified densities if dark matter undergoes enhanced clustering in the early Universe, as is the case for axions in the post-inflationary scenario. This ultra-fine-grained dark matter substructure is usually considered irrelevant and undetectable for most direct detection experiments, but for axion haloscopes, this may not be the case. We develop and explore several plausible models for the degree of fine-grained axion dark matter substructure so as to evaluate its impact on the detectability of axions. We find that not only is this substructure detectable in haloscope experiments, but that it may enhance the detectability of the axion if data is analysed with a high-enough frequency resolution. This conclusion motivates ongoing high-resolution analyses of axion data by haloscope collaborations, which have the potential to reveal evidence of the QCD axion even if their nominal experimental sensitivity does not reach the required level under the Standard Halo Model assumption.

2025-09-18, **Monojet and direct detection constraints on real scalar dark matter: EFT and a simple UV completion**, Arnab Roy et.al., [2509.14869v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14869v1)

 We consider constraints that can be placed on certain invisible scalar particles through monojet studies at the LHC and compare them with those from direct detection experiments when interpreted as dark matter. Whereas direct detection constraints are typically more restrictive, we identify regions of parameter space where monojet studies provide important complementary bounds. We carry out our analysis using both a $\phi$SMEFT for real scalar particle pairs coupled to standard-model fields through operators of up to dimension six, and a simple UV completion with vector-like quarks, with both the scalars and the vector-like quarks being odd under a $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ symmetry, while the SM particles are even. The vector-like quarks can only decay into a jet and an invisible scalar, and we recast the current ATLAS monojet data to constrain their parameter space. Comparison of the two descriptions yields some insight into interpreting dark matter constraints obtained with EFTs.

2025-09-18, **The Altered Chaplygin Model as a Model for Dark Energy**, Yi-Syuan et.al., [2509.14826v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14826v1)

 We present a scalar-field formulation of the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) and modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) models, in which the cosmic fluid dynamics are reproduced by canonical Lagrangians with analytically derived energy density $\rho(\phi)$, pressure $p(\phi)$, and scalar potential $V(\phi)$. This framework provides a unified description of dark matter and dark energy, transitioning naturally from a matter-dominated phase at early times to a negative-pressure dark-energy phase at late times. In this scalar-field formulation, the GCG and MCG models are naturally applicable to both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. Extending this approach, we develop a systematic method to obtain a class of integrable scalar-field cosmological models. In this study, we use this method to construct a new scalar-field altered Chaplygin gas (ACG) model. To investigate the viability of Chaplygin-type models, we perform a likelihood analysis using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation together with Cepheid-calibrated distances. We examine four models, $\Lambda$CDM, GCG, MCG, and ACG, obtaining posterior constraints on the Hubble constant $H\_0$, the present-day effective equation of state $\omega\_0$, the transition redshift $z^\star$, and the cosmic age $t\_0$. With the Cepheid calibration fixing the absolute distance scale, the inferred $H\_{0}$ remains nearly model-independent. The Chaplygin-type models predict an earlier onset of cosmic acceleration than $\Lambda$CDM and give a broader range for the inferred age of the Universe, reflecting their greater flexibility in late-time expansion histories. Among them, the ACG model provides tighter parameter constraints, while the GCG and MCG models produce broader posteriors due to parameter degeneracies.

2025-09-18, **The first stars**, Simon C. O. Glover et.al., [2509.14799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14799v1)

 Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.

2025-09-18, **Probing initial isocurvature perturbation with 21cm one-point statistics**, Zhenfei Qin et.al., [2509.14751v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14751v1)

 Isocurvature perturbations expected from multi-field inflation models can leave unique signatures in the early Universe, but remain weakly constrained, especially on small scales. In this work, we investigate the constraining power of one-point statistics (variance and skewness) of the 21cm brightness temperature during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, using semi-numerical simulations from 21cmFAST. We model both adiabatic and cold dark matter isocurvature modes, exploring their impact on the matter power spectrum, the timing of structure formation, and the evolution of neutral hydrogen. By varying astrophysical parameters as well as isocurvature fraction and spectral index, we quantify their respective effects on the 21cm power spectrum and on one-point statistics. Our results show that while variance is highly sensitive to the timing of cosmic events and provides tight constraints on isocurvature parameters, skewness is more strongly affected by astrophysical uncertainties and observational noise. Incorporating realistic instrumental noise based on SKA configurations, we perform a Fisher analysis and demonstrate that 21cm variance measurements can constrain the isocurvature fraction down to the sub-percent level, though a strong degeneracy with the spectral index remains. We discuss the importance of complementary probes, such as the 21cm forest and galaxy surveys, to break these parameter degeneracies. Our findings highlight the power of 21cm one-point statistics as robust and independent tools for probing early-Universe physics beyond what is accessible with traditional power spectrum analyses.

2025-09-18, **Signature of axion dark matter in low-frequency terrestrial electromagnetic fields: formulation and predictions**, Atsushi Taruya et.al., [2509.14673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14673v1)

 We develop a theoretical framework for axion dark matter (DM) searches using terrestrial electromagnetic (EM) fields. Axions couple to the geomagnetic field and generate a monochromatic EM signal at a frequency set by the axion mass. Incorporating a realistic atmospheric conductivity, we describe the axion-induced EM waves confined in the Earth-ionosphere cavity, avoiding the divergences present in idealized treatments. Our semi-analytical method yields quantitative predictions for the axion-induced magnetic field near the Earth's surface, and we found that (i) at $m\_{\rm a} \gtrsim 10^{-14}$ eV, the signal exhibits resonance structures aligned with Schumann resonances, and the magnetic field amplitude is especially enhanced at $m\_{\rm a} \sim 3 \times 10^{-14}$ eV. (ii) The signal amplitude and orientation also vary with geographic location, with Southeast Asia offering the strongest sensitivity. These predictions are insensitive to uncertainties in conductivity models and boundary conditions. Those distinctive features provide a reliable template to distinguish axion-induced signals from natural or anthropogenic EM backgrounds, and the formalism can be extended to other DM candidates such as dark photons.

2025-09-18, **Relativistic Atomic Effects of Dark Matter Electron Scattering**, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., [2509.14534v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14534v1)

 The dark matter scattering with atomic bound electrons is a crucial avenue for exploring the sub-GeV mass range. If not handled properly, even negative values can arise in the scattering matrix element squared or equivalently the differential cross section in extreme cases. Starting from quantum field theory, we establish a theoretically consistent formalism to account for the atomic effects. Especially, we investigate the difference between the non-relativistic and relativistic calculations to show that the relativistic effects can lead to a $30\% \sim 50\%$ reduction in the atomic factor. In other words, not just a theoretically consistent formalism for the atomic effects but also relativistic calculation with Dirac equation are necessary.

2025-09-18, **Unveiling TeV halos among unidentified extended TeV sources**, Michela Rigoselli et.al., [2509.15168v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15168v1)

 In recent years, the number of known sources emitting very- and ultra-high-energy gamma-rays has increased significantly thanks to facilities such as LHAASO and HAWC. Many of the observed sources are still unidentified or poorly constrained due to the limited angular resolution of these instruments; however, it is now ascertained that approximately half of them have a pulsar in coincidence. Some of these unidentified extended sources may be the result of the diffusion of leptons accelerated by the pulsar itself or in its nebula to energies exceeding 50 TeV. This new class of sources, called TeV halos, is characterized by a peculiar radial profile that, if properly resolved, is key to distinguishing them from other TeV sources that are associated with a pulsar, such as supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae. In this contribution, we consider all the pulsars which are spatially coincident with an unidentified extended TeV source, in order to quantify whether its spin-down power, age and distance allow the pulsar to produce a TeV halo with the observed flux and extension. We also investigate how the next generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), namely the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and the ASTRI Mini-Array, will observe and characterize these TeV halos. We present a set of simulated sources with the expected morphology and spectrum, and we show for which of them we can distinguish between TeV halos and other classes of extended sources.

2025-09-18, **Parameterizing quasi-quintessence and quasi-phantom fields without the nearly flat potential approximation**, Anna Chiara Alfano et.al., [2509.15146v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15146v1)

 An alternative dark energy description based on a generalized K-essence scenario is here explored. In particular, we consider a \emph{quasi-quintessence} and/or \emph{quasi-phantom} field, whose pressure does not depend on the kinetic energy, firstly discussed in the context of the cosmological constant problem. In so doing, we fix the background evolution and investigate the main observational signatures of its corresponding fluid-like representation. The corresponding scalar field can be parameterized independently from the potential form and without imposing the condition $\omega \sim -1$ used for quintessence and phantom fields. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters by performing Monte-Carlo Markov chain simulations through the adoption of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and perform separated analyses, employing different data catalogs. More precisely, as data sets we employ observational Hubble data, type Ia supernovae and the second data release from the DESI Collaboration, namely DESI DR2. We define a hierarchy among analyses and, precisely, in the first we adopt all three samples, while the second excludes the DESI data points, with the aim of facing its effect on corresponding bounds. Our findings suggest that the \emph{quasi-quintessence} scenario prefers Planck's value of the Hubble constant $H\_0$, but suggesting that, when the DESI sample is excluded from our computations, $\omega\_0$ enters the phantom regime, although still compatible at $1$-$\sigma$ confidence level with a cosmological constant. Remarkably, these results appear in tension than those found for a standard quintessence, explored within the context of the recent DESI release, likely indicating that the DESI data may furnish inconclusive results depending on the kind of scalar field involved into the computation.

 Coasting cosmology offers an intriguing and straightforward framework for understanding the universe. In this work, we employ the Trans-Planckian Censorship Criterion (TCC) conjecture to test the viability of the coasting cosmology and propose an entropic dark energy (EDE) model within this framework. By applying the holographic principle to constrain the dark energy density and adopting the Bekenstein entropy and Tsallis entropy as the constraining entropies of the system, we find that, in a holographic coasting cosmological framework where dark energy and dark matter evolve independently, the Tsallis entropy satisfies certain general assumptions better than the Bekenstein entropy. Thus, there may be a fundamental relationship between Tsallis entropy and dark energy. We utilize observational data from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) to constrain EDE model. The optimal Tsallis parameter obtained aligns well with theoretical expectations. To evaluate the model's fit to the observed data, we calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Kullback Information Criterion (KIC), and compare these metrics with those derived from $\Lambda$CDM, under which the model shows some improvement. Overall, this model provides a novel and simple on the evolution of the universe.

2025-09-18, **No evidence for $H_0$ anisotropy from Tully-Fisher or supernova distances**, Richard Stiskalek et.al., [2509.14997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14997v1)

 Claims of anisotropy in the Hubble constant have been made based on direct distance tracers such as Tully-Fisher galaxies and Type Ia supernovae. We revisit these using the CosmicFlows-4 Tully-Fisher W1 subsample, 2MTF and SFI++ Tully-Fisher catalogues, and the Pantheon+ supernova compilation (restricted to $z < 0.05$), including a dipole in either the Tully-Fisher zero-point or the standardised supernova absolute magnitude. Our forward-modelling framework jointly calibrates the distance relation, marginalises over distances, and accounts for peculiar velocities using a linear-theory reconstruction. We compare the anisotropic and isotropic model using the Bayesian evidence. In the CosmicFlows-4 sample, we infer a zero-point dipole of amplitude $0.087 \pm 0.019$ mag, or $4.1\pm0.9$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. This is consistent with previous estimates but at higher significance: model comparison yields odds of $877\!:\!1$ in favour of including the zero-point dipole. In Pantheon+ we infer zero-point dipole amplitude of $0.049 \pm 0.013$ mag, or $2.3\pm 0.6$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. However, by allowing for a radially varying velocity dipole, we show that the anisotropic model captures local flow features (or possibly systematics) in the data rather than an actual linearly growing effective bulk flow caused by anisotropy in the zero-point or expansion rate. Inferring a more general bulk flow curve we find results fully consistent with expectations from the standard cosmological model.

2025-09-18, **Radial pulsation runaway in massive red supergiants in late evolutionary stage and implications to hydrogen-rich supernovae**, Akihiro Suzuki et.al., [2509.14928v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14928v1)

 Performing a series of hydrodynamic stellar evolutionary simulations with \textsc{Mesa} (Module for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), we investigate the excitation and growth of radial pulsations of massive red supergiants (RSGs) with the initial mass range of $M\_\mathrm{ini}=13$--$18\,\mathrm{M}\_\odot$. We show that strong radial pulsations develop in the hydrogen-rich envelope in their late evolutionary stages, and eventually the surface radial velocity exceeds the escape velocity for higher-mass models. On the other hand, lower-mass models exhibit more moderate pulsations with finite velocity amplitudes and are expected to keep massive hydrogen-rich envelopes when they evolve toward the gravitational collapse of the iron core. While the latter group ends up as a familiar transient population of exploding RSGs, i.e., type IIP supernovae (SNe), the former group may expel a part of their envelopes and explode as different transients population. We investigate how the energy of the oscillating envelope is dissipated and released as radiation. We also empirically determine the condition for the pulsation-driven mass ejection in terms of the luminosity-to-mass ratio, $L/M>10^{3.9}\mathrm{L}\_\odot/\mathrm{M}\_\odot$. The corresponding luminosity threshold for the explored mass range may explain the observationally inferred constraints on type IIP SN progenitors.

2025-09-18, **Studying SNR-MC interactions as galactic PeVatrons in the era of CTAO and ASTRI Mini-Array**, Alan Sunny et.al., [2509.14867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14867v1)

 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely recognized as key accelerators of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), supported by the detection of the characteristic pion bump in the gamma-ray spectra of several SNRs. However, the recent observation of ultra-high-energy (UHE, greater than 100 TeV) gamma-rays by LHAASO from sources such as W51 region challenges standard models, which predict CR acceleration up to PeV energies only during the early (~ 100 year) phase of SNR evolution. Given the older age of known SNRs, alternative mechanisms - such as the interaction of runaway CRs with nearby molecular clouds (MCs) - have been proposed to explain the persistent UHE emission. In this study, we focus on the W51 complex, particularly the W51C-B region, as a promising site for investigating SNR-MC interactions. Simulated observations with the CTAO and the ASTRI Mini-Array are presented to demonstrate their crucial role in bridging the energy gap between Fermi-LAT and LHAASO, especially in the 0.3-100 TeV range. Their improved angular resolution will also help disentangle emission components from the interaction zone and nearby sources. Our theoretical modelling suggests that accelerated particles at the shock can account for the radio and GeV data, while UHE emission could be best explained by the combined contribution from both acceleration and adiabatic compression of cloud material at the SNR-MC interface.

2025-09-18, **The Altered Chaplygin Model as a Model for Dark Energy**, Yi-Syuan et.al., [2509.14826v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14826v1)

 We present a scalar-field formulation of the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) and modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) models, in which the cosmic fluid dynamics are reproduced by canonical Lagrangians with analytically derived energy density $\rho(\phi)$, pressure $p(\phi)$, and scalar potential $V(\phi)$. This framework provides a unified description of dark matter and dark energy, transitioning naturally from a matter-dominated phase at early times to a negative-pressure dark-energy phase at late times. In this scalar-field formulation, the GCG and MCG models are naturally applicable to both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. Extending this approach, we develop a systematic method to obtain a class of integrable scalar-field cosmological models. In this study, we use this method to construct a new scalar-field altered Chaplygin gas (ACG) model. To investigate the viability of Chaplygin-type models, we perform a likelihood analysis using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation together with Cepheid-calibrated distances. We examine four models, $\Lambda$CDM, GCG, MCG, and ACG, obtaining posterior constraints on the Hubble constant $H\_0$, the present-day effective equation of state $\omega\_0$, the transition redshift $z^\star$, and the cosmic age $t\_0$. With the Cepheid calibration fixing the absolute distance scale, the inferred $H\_{0}$ remains nearly model-independent. The Chaplygin-type models predict an earlier onset of cosmic acceleration than $\Lambda$CDM and give a broader range for the inferred age of the Universe, reflecting their greater flexibility in late-time expansion histories. Among them, the ACG model provides tighter parameter constraints, while the GCG and MCG models produce broader posteriors due to parameter degeneracies.

2025-09-18, **The first stars**, Simon C. O. Glover et.al., [2509.14799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14799v1)

 Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.
