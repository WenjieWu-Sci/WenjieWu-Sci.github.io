2024-06-25, **The compact circumstellar material of SN 2024ggi: Another supernova with a pre-explosion effervescent zone and jet-driven explosion**, Noam Soker et.al., [2406.17751v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17751v1)

 I examine recent theoretical studies and observations of the recent core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 20224ggi and find that the likely explanation for its dense, compact circumstellar material is an effervescent model, where parcels or streams of gas are uplifted by stellar convection and pulsation and fall back. The effervescent zone exists alongside the regular wind from the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor of SN 2024ggi. I find that an extended wind-acceleration zone encounters some difficulties in accounting for the required CSM mass. Recent modelling finds the explosion energy of SN 2024ggi to be >1e51 erg and up to 2e51 erg. I examine this explosion energy against a recent study of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism and find that this mechanism has difficulties in accounting for the required energy. This suggests that the explosion was caused by the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM), adding to other recent pieces of evidence supporting the JJEM, particularly point-symmetric CCSN remnants.

2024-06-25, **The SNEWS 2.0 Alert Software for the Coincident Detection of Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae**, M. Kara et.al., [2406.17743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17743v1)

 The neutrino signal from the next galactic core-collapse supernova will provide an invaluable early warning of the explosion. By combining the burst trigger from several neutrino detectors, the location of the explosion can be triangulated minutes to hours before the optical emission becomes visible, while also reducing the rate of false-positive triggers. To enable multi-messenger follow-up of nearby supernovae, the SuperNova Early Warning System 2.0 (SNEWS 2.0) will produce a combined alert using a global network of neutrino detectors. This paper describes the trigger publishing and alert formation framework of the SNEWS 2.0 network. The framework is built on the HOPSKOTCH publish-subscribe system to easily incorporate new detectors into the network, and it implements a coincidence system to form alerts and estimate a false-positive rate for the combined triggers. The paper outlines the structure of the SNEWS 2.0 software and the initial testing of coincident signals.

2024-06-25, **Illuminating the dark: mono-$Î³$ signals at NA62**, D. Barducci et.al., [2406.17599v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17599v1)

 Dipole interactions between dark sector states or between a Standard Model particle and a dark state can efficiently be searched for via high-intensity fixed-target facilities. We propose to look for the associated mono-$\gamma$ signature at the NA62 experiment running in beam-dump mode. Focusing on models of dipole inelastic Dark Matter and active-sterile neutrino dipole interactions, we compute the corresponding expected sensitivities finding promising prospects for discovery.

2024-06-25, **A Hybrid Approach to Event Reconstruction for Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes Combining Machine Learning and Likelihood Fitting**, Georg Schwefer et.al., [2406.17502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17502v1)

 The imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique provides potentially the highest angular resolution achievable in astronomy at energies above the X-ray waveband. High-resolution measurements provide the key to progress on many of the major questions in high-energy astrophysics, including the sites of particle acceleration to PeV energies. The potential of the next-generation CTA observatory in this regard can be realised with the help of improved algorithms for the reconstruction of the air-shower direction and energy. Hybrid methods combining likelihood-fitting techniques with neural networks represent a particularly promising approach and have recently been applied to the reconstruction of astrophysical neutrinos. Here, we present the FreePACT algorithm, a hybrid reconstruction method for IACTs. In this, making use of the neural ratio estimation technique from the field of likelihood-free inference, the analytical likelihood used in traditional image likelihood fitting is replaced by a neural network that approximates the charge probability density function for each pixel in the camera. The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated using simulations of the planned CTA southern array. For this setup, FreePACT provides significant performance improvements over analytical likelihood techniques, with improvements in angular and energy resolution of 25% or more over a wide energy range and an angular resolution as low as 40 arcseconds at energies above 50 TeV for observations at 20 degrees zenith angle. It also yields more accurate estimations of the uncertainties on the reconstructed parameters and speeds up the reconstruction compared to analytical likelihood techniques while showing the same stability with respect to changes in the observation conditions. Therefore, the FreePACT method is a promising upgrade over the current state-of-the-art likelihood event reconstruction techniques.

2024-06-24, **Cosmic Stability of Dark Matter from Pauli Blocking**, Brian Batell et.al., [2406.17028v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17028v1)

 Why does dark matter (DM) live longer than the age of the Universe? Here we study a novel sub-eV scalar DM candidate whose stability is due to the Pauli exclusion of its fermionic decay products. We analyze the stability of the DM condensate against decays, scatterings (i.e., evaporation), and parametric resonance, delineating the viable parameter regions in which DM is cosmologically stable. In a minimal scenario in which the scalar DM decays to a pair of new exotic fermions, we find that scattering can populate an interacting thermal dark sector component to energies far above the DM mass. This self-interacting dark radiation may potentially alleviate the Hubble tensions. Furthermore, our scenario can be probed through precise measurements of the halo mass function or the masses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies since scattering prevents the DM from becoming too dense. On the other hand, if the lightest neutrino stabilizes the DM, the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) can be significantly altered from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction and thus be probed in the future by C$\nu$B detection experiments.

2024-06-24, **The neutrino roof: Single-scatter ceilings in dark matter direct detection**, Nirmal Raj et.al., [2406.17015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17015v1)

 We identify the maximum cross sections probed by single-scatter ``WIMP" searches in dark matter direct detection. Due to Poisson fluctuations in scatter multiplicity, these ceilings scale logarithmically with mass for heavy dark matter and often lie in regions probed by multiscatter searches. Using a generalized formula for single-scatter event rates we recast WIMP searches by the quintal-to-tonne scale detectors XENON1T, XENONnT, LZ, PANDAX-II, PANDAX-4T, DarkSide-50 and DEAP-3600 to obtain ceilings and floors up to a few $10^{17}$ GeV mass and $10^{-22}$ cm$^2$ per-nucleus cross section. We do this for coherent, geometric, isospin-violating xenophobic and argophobic spin-independent scattering, and neutron-only and proton-only spin-dependent scattering. Future large-exposure detectors would register an almost irreducible background of atmospheric neutrinos that would determine a dark matter sensitivity ceiling that we call the ``neutrino roof", in analogy with the well-studied ``neutrino floor". Accounting for this background, we estimate the reaches of the 10$-$100 tonne scale DarkSide-20k, DARWIN/XLZD, PANDAX-xT, and Argo, which would probe many decades of unconstrained parameter space up to the Planck mass, as well as of $10^3-10^4$ tonne scale noble liquid detectors that have been proposed in synergy with neutrino experiments.

2024-06-24, **Explaining PTA Results by Metastable Cosmic Strings from SO(10) GUT**, Stefan Antusch et.al., [2406.17014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17014v1)

 In a recent paper (see https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.095053), we have demonstrated that the 2023 PTA results, which hint at a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies, point towards a promising model-building route for realizing $SO(10)$ Grand Unification with embedded inflation. The proposed supersymmetric scenario solves the doublet-triplet splitting without fine-tuning, accounts for charged fermion and neutrino masses, avoids conflicts with current proton decay bounds, and includes only representations no larger than the adjoint. It features multi-step breaking of $SO(10)$ to the Standard Model gauge symmetry, with inflation embedded such that metastable cosmic strings are produced at the end of inflation. This cosmic string network generates a stochastic GW background that can explain the PTA results. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the singled out GUT model class, focusing on how the gauge coupling unification condition affects the scales of multi-step $SO(10)$ breaking and the preferred GW spectra. The lowest breaking scale, linked to inflation, the generation of right-handed neutrino masses for the seesaw mechanism, and metastable cosmic string production, coincides with the range suggested by the PTA results.

2024-06-24, **Discovering neutrino tridents at the Large Hadron Collider**, Wolfgang Altmannshofer et.al., [2406.16803v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16803v1)

 Neutrino trident production of di-lepton pairs is well recognized as a sensitive probe of both electroweak physics and physics beyond the Standard Model. Although a rare process, it could be significantly boosted by such new physics, and it also allows the electroweak theory to be tested in a new regime. We demonstrate that the forward neutrino physics program at the Large Hadron Collider offers a promising opportunity to measure for the first time, dimuon neutrino tridents with a statistical significance exceeding $5\sigma$. We present predictions for various proposed experiments and outline a specific experimental strategy to identify the signal and mitigate backgrounds, based on "reverse tracking" dimuon pairs in the FASER$\nu$2 detector. We also discuss prospects for constraining beyond Standard Model contributions to neutrino trident rates at high energies.

2024-06-24, **Convolutional neural network for Lyman break galaxies classification and redshift regression in DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument)**, Julien Taran et.al., [2406.16730v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16730v1)

 DESI is a groundbreaking international project to observe more than 40 million quasars and galaxies over a 5-year period to create a 3D map of the sky. This map will enable us to probe multiple aspects of cosmology, from dark energy to neutrino mass. We are focusing here on one type of object observed by DESI, the Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The aim is to use their spectra to determine whether they are indeed LBGs, and if so, to determine their distance from the Earth using a phenomenon called redshift. This will enable us to place these galaxies on the DESI 3D map.   The aim is therefore to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) inspired by QuasarNET (See arXiv:1808.09955), performing simultaneously a classification (LBG type or not) and a regression task (determine the redshift of the LBGs). Initially, data augmentation techniques such as shifting the spectra in wavelengths, adding noise to the spectra, or adding synthetic spectra were used to increase the model training dataset from 3,019 data to over 66,000. In a second phase, modifications to the QuasarNET architecture, notably through transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian optimization, boosted model performance.   Gains of up to 26% were achieved on the Purity/Efficiency curve, which is used to evaluate model performance, particularly in areas with interesting redshifts, at low (around 2) and high (around 4) redshifts. The best model obtained an average score of 94%, compared with 75% for the initial model.

2024-06-24, **A Scotogenic model with U(1) symmetry and a scalar dark matter**, Anjan Kumar Barik et.al., [2406.16546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16546v1)

 We study a scotogenic model augmented with an additional U(1) gauge and a discrete Z2 symmetry. The lightest Z2-odd particle in our model becomes the dark matter (DM) candidate while tiny neutrino masses are realized at one loop. We explore the parameter space of the model for which the DM relic density is satisfied, and the correct low-energy neutrino observables are reproduced. The extended gauge symmetry includes beyond Standard Model (SM) particle spectrum consisting of vector-like fermions and scalars. We also highlight possible collider signatures of these particles at the LHC.

2024-06-24, **Probing the Neutrino Seesaw Scale with Gravitational Waves**, Bartosz Fornal et.al., [2406.16463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16463v1)

 Neutrinos are the most elusive particles of the Standard Model. The physics behind their masses remains unknown and requires introducing new particles and interactions. An elegant solution to this problem is provided by the seesaw mechanism. Typically considered at a high scale, it is potentially testable in gravitational wave experiments by searching for a spectrum from cosmic strings, which offers a rather generic signature across many high-scale seesaw models. Here we consider the possibility of a low-scale seesaw mechanism at the PeV scale, generating neutrino masses within the framework of a model with gauged U(1) lepton number. In this case, the gravitational wave signal at high frequencies arises from a first order phase transition in the early Universe, whereas at low frequencies it is generated by domain wall annihilation, leading to a double-peaked structure in the gravitational wave spectrum. The signals discussed here can be searched for in upcoming experiments, including gravitational wave interferometers, pulsar timing arrays, and astrometry observations.

2024-06-24, **Constraining dark matter from strong phase transitions in a $U(1)_{L_Î¼-L_Ï}$ model: Implications for neutrino masses and muon $g-2$**, Sandhya Choubey et.al., [2406.16460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16460v1)

 In this paper, we study a non-minimal gauged $U(1)\_{L\_{\mu}-L\_{\tau}}$ model, where we add two complex singlet scalars, three right-handed Majorana neutrinos (RHN), and a vector-like dark fermion to the Standard Model (SM), all non-trivially charged under the extra gauge symmetry. The model offers an easy resolution to the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly, which fixes the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the two-zero minor structure in the RHN mass matrix provides successful predictions for neutrino oscillation parameters, including the Dirac phase. The extended scalar sector can easily induce first-order phase transitions. We identify all possible phase transition patterns in the three-dimensional field space. We quantify the associated gravitational waves from the sound wave source and demonstrate that the signatures can be observed in future space-based experiments. We find that strong first-order phase transitions require large values of scalar quartic couplings which constrain the scalar dark matter (DM) relic density to a maximum of $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-5}$ when we consider the DM direct detection bound. Nonetheless, the model successfully explains the DM relic density via contribution from the vector-like dark fermion. We show the allowed range of the model parameters that can address all the beyond SM issues targeted in this study.

2024-06-24, **A ROOT based detector geometry and event visualization system for JUNO-TAO**, Minghua Liao et.al., [2406.16431v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16431v1)

 The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO or JUNO-TAO) is a satellite experiment of Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) and located near the Taishan nuclear power plant (NPP). TAO will measure the energy spectrum of reactor antineutrinos with unprecedented precision, which will benefit both reactor neutrino physics and the nuclear database. A detector geometry and event visualization system has been developed for TAO. The software is based on ROOT packages and embedded in the TAO offline software framework. It provides an intuitive tool to visualize the detector geometry, tune the reconstruction algorithm, understand the neutrino physics, and monitor the operation of reactors at NPP. The further applications of the visualization system in the experimental operation of TAO and its future development are also discussed.

2024-06-24, **Large CP Violation from the Minimum Seesaw Model**, Yu-Cheng Qiu et.al., [2406.16352v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16352v1)

 The minimum seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos is considered, where the lightest neutrino is naturally massless. Instead of adopting texture zeros in the lepton Yukawa matrices, which cause both theoretical and experimental troubles, here we propose two-$\boldsymbol\epsilon$ textures, where $\boldsymbol\epsilon$ is a small number. Combined with neutrino oscillation experimental data, we find that a large CP angle is preferred for the normal neutrino mass order. In contrast, the CP angle almost vanishes for the inverted order. This can be well-tested in near-future experiments, such as Hyper-Kamiokande. Besides, the predicted effective Majorana neutrino mass $m\_{ee}$ and the total neutrino mass $\sum m^\nu\_i$ are also within reach of ongoing or future experiments.

2024-06-24, **Displaced Heavy Neutral Lepton from New Higgs Doublet**, Fa-Xin Yang et.al., [2406.16269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16269v1)

 Heavy neutral leptons $N$ are introduced to explain the tiny neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. For proper small mixing parameter $V\_{\ell N}$, the heavy neutral leptons $N$ become long-lived, which leads to the displaced vertex signature at colliders. In this paper, we consider the displaced heavy neutral lepton from the neutrinophilic Higgs doublet $\Phi\_\nu$ decay. The new Higgs doublet with MeV scale VEV can naturally explain the tiny neutrino masses with TeV scale $N$. Different from current experimental searches via the $W^\pm\to \ell^\pm N$ decay, the new decays as $H^\pm\to \ell^\pm N$ are not suppressed by the small mixing parameter $V\_{\ell N}$. Therefore, a larger parameter space is expected to be detected at colliders. We then investigate the promising region at the 14 TeV HL-LHC and the 3 TeV CLIC. According to our simulation, the DV signature could probe $\|V\_{\ell N}\|^2\gtrsim10^{-19}$ with $m\_N<m\_{H^+}$, which covers the seesaw predicted value $\|V\_{\ell N}\|^2\sim m\_\nu/m\_N$. We could probe $m\_{H^+}\lesssim1200$ GeV at the 14 TeV HL-LHC and $m\_{H^+}\lesssim1490$ GeV at the 3 TeV CLIC.

2024-06-25, **Tachyonic production of dark relics: classical lattice vs. quantum 2PI in Hartree truncation**, Kimmo Kainulainen et.al., [2406.17468v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17468v1)

 We study the out-of-equilibrium production of non-minimally coupled self-interacting scalar dark matter during reheating using classical lattice simulations. The outcomes of the classical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the previous results obtained using the quantum 2PI approach in the Hartree truncation. In particular, the novel non-linear resonance found in the 2PI Hartee study is present also in the classical lattice simulations and can dominate the final dark matter yield. For the parameters considered, the difference in final value of the scalar two-point function between the two approaches is a factor of O(1).

2024-06-25, **An Alternative Channel to Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Dynamical Friction of Dark Matter?**, Ke Qin et.al., [2406.17209v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17209v1)

 Both the anomalous magnetic braking of Ap/Bp stars and the surrounding circumbinary disk models can account for the formation of black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), while the simulated effective temperatures of the donor stars are significantly higher than the observed values. Therefore, the formation of BH LMXBs is not still completely understood. In this work, we diagnose whether the dynamical friction between dark matter and the companion stars can drive BH binaries to evolve toward the observed BH LMXBs and alleviate the effective temperature problem. Assuming that there exists a density spike of dark matter around BH, the dynamical friction can produce an efficient angular momentum loss, driving BH binaries with an intermediate-mass companion star to evolve into BH LMXBs for a spike index higher than $\gamma = 1.58$. Our detailed stellar evolution models show that the calculated effective temperatures can match the observed value of most BH LMXBs for a spike index range of $\gamma = 1.7-2.1$. However, the simulated mass-transfer rates when $\gamma = 2.0$ and $2.1$ are too high to be consistent with the observed properties that BH LMXBs appears as soft X-ray transients. Therefore, the dynamical friction of dark matter can only alleviate the effective temperature problem of those BH LMXBs with a relatively short orbital period.

2024-06-24, **Importance of Initial Condition on Bar Secular Evolution: Role of Halo Angular Momentum Distribution Discontinuity**, Sandeep Kumar Kataria et.al., [2406.17113v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17113v1)

 The dark matter halo properties, for example, mass, spin and concentration play a significant role in the formation and evolution of bars in disk galaxies. This study highlights the importance of a new parameter: the dark matter halo angular momentum distribution in the central region of disk. We experiment with N-body galaxy models having a disk and dark matter similar to Milky Way-type galaxies. In these models, we vary the discontinuity of the angular momentum distribution of the halo (the total spin is the same for all models). Our N-body experiments suggest that bar forms in all models after a few Gyr of disk evolution. However, in the secular evolution of the bar, as we evolve these models until 9.78 Gyr, the bar gains its strength in the model with the most continuous halo angular momentum distribution, and the bar loses strength for the most discontinuous halo angular momentum distribution. The secular evolution of the bar suggests that box/peanut/x-shaped bulges similar to those found in the Milky Way disk should be more pronounced in halos with continuous halo angular momentum distributions. This study demonstrates the importance of the initial condition setup of galaxy systems, namely the discontinuity in the dark matter halo angular momentum distribution for a given density distribution, on the bar secular evolution in the disk galaxy simulations. Further, this study helps reconcile the conflicting results of bar secular evolution in a high-spinning halo of the recent literature.

2024-06-24, **Formation of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Black Holes and Red Stragglers via Hawking Stars in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies**, Andrew D. Santarelli et.al., [2406.17052v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17052v1)

 Presently, primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window from $10^{-16}$ M$\_\odot$ to $10^{-10}$ M$\_\odot$ are a popular dark matter candidate. If they exist, some stars would capture them upon formation, and they would slowly accrete the star over gigayears. Such Hawking stars -- stars with a central PBH -- provide a novel channel for the formation of both sub-Chandrasekhar mass black holes as well as red straggler stars. Here we report on stellar evolution models that extend our previous work to Hawking stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.4 M$\_\odot$. We explore three accretion schemes, and find that a wide range of PBHs in the asteroid-mass window can robustly accrete stars as small as 1 M$\_{\odot}$ within the age of the Universe. This mechanism of producing sub-solar mass black holes is highly dependent on the assumed accretion physics and stellar metallicity. Lower-metallicity stars are generally accreted more rapidly, suggesting that it may be more likely for sub-Chandrasekhar mass Hawking stars formed in the early universe, such as those in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, to transmute their star into a sub-Chandrasekhar mass black hole within a Hubble time. We present a stellar population synthesis of a Draco II-like UFD galaxy containing Hawking stars and show that the number of red stragglers they produce can qualitatively match the observed population.

2024-06-24, **Thermal Dark Matter with Low-Temperature Reheating**, NicolÃ¡s Bernal et.al., [2406.17039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17039v1)

 We explore the production of thermal dark matter (DM) candidates (WIMPs, SIMPs, ELDERs and Cannibals) during cosmic reheating. Assuming a general parametrization for the scaling of the inflaton energy density and the standard model (SM) temperature, we study the requirements for kinetic and chemical DM freeze-out in a model-independent way. For each of the mechanisms, up to two solutions that fit the entire observed DM relic density exist, for a given reheating scenario and DM mass. As an example, we assume a simple particle physics model in which DM interacts with itself and with SM through contact interactions. We find that low-temperature reheating can accommodate a wider range of couplings and larger masses than those permitted in the usual instantaneous high-temperature reheating. This results in DM solutions for WIMPs reaching masses as high as $10^{14}$~GeV, whereas for SIMPs and ELDERs, we can reach masses of $10^{13}$~GeV. Interestingly, current experimental data already constrain the enlarged parameter space of these models with low-reheating temperatures. Next-generation experiments could further probe these scenarios.

2024-06-24, **High-definition imaging of an extended filament connecting active quasars at cosmic noon**, Davide Tornotti et.al., [2406.17035v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17035v1)

 Filaments connecting halos are a long-standing prediction of cold dark matter theories. We present a novel detection of the cosmic web emission connecting two massive quasar-host galaxies at cosmic noon in the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF) using unprecedentedly deep observations that unlock a high-definition view of the filament morphology, a measure of the transition radius between the intergalactic and circumgalactic medium, and the characterization of the surface brightness profiles along the filament and in the transverse direction. Through systematic comparisons with simulations, we validate the filaments' typical density predicted in the current cold dark matter model. Our analysis of the MUDF field, an excellent laboratory for quantitatively studying filaments in emission, opens a new avenue to understanding the cosmic web that, being a fundamental prediction of cosmology, bears key information on the essence of dark matter.

2024-06-24, **Time Non-locality in Dark Matter and LSS**, Arhum Ansari et.al., [2406.17025v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17025v1)

 We explore the intriguing phenomenon of time non-locality in the evolution of dark matter and Large Scale Structure (LSS). Recently in\,\cite{Donath:2023sav}, it was shown that time non-locality emerges in bias tracer fluctuations, which are $SO(3)$ scalars in real space, at fifth order in the perturbation expansion in dark matter overdensity. We demonstrate that by breaking the symmetry down to $SO(2)$, which is the case whenever line-of-sight effects become important, such as for flux fluctuations in the Lyman $\alpha$ forest, the temporal non-locality appears at the third order in expansion. Additionally, within the framework of EFTofLSS, we demonstrate that time non-locality manifests in the effective stress tensor of dark matter, which is a second rank tensor under $SO(3)$ transformations, again at the third order in dark matter overdensity. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the standard $\Pi$ basis\,\cite{Mirbabayi:2014zca} in handling time non-local operators.

2024-06-24, **Self-Interacting Dark Matter, Core Collapse and the Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing Discrepancy**, Isaque Dutra et.al., [2406.17024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17024v1)

 Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters has emerged as a powerful tool to probe the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm of structure formation in the Universe. Despite the remarkable explanatory power of CDM on large scales, tensions with observations on small scales have been reported. Recent studies find that the observational cross-section for Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing (GGSL) in clusters exceeds the CDM prediction by more than an order of magnitude, and persists even after rigorous examination of various possible systematics. We investigate the impact of modifying the internal structure of cluster dark matter sub-halos on GGSL and report that altering the inner density profile, given by $r^{\gamma}$, to steeper slopes with $\gamma > 2.5$ can alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. Deviating from the $\gamma \sim 1.0$ cusps that CDM predicts, these steeper slopes could arise in models of self-interacting dark matter undergoing core collapse. Our results motivate additional study of sub-halo core collapse in dense cluster environments.

2024-06-24, **Constraining galaxy properties with complete samples of lenses**, Qing Zhou et.al., [2406.17019v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17019v1)

 The statistics of Einstein radii for a sample of strong lenses can provide valuable constraints on the underlying mass distribution. The correct interpretation, however, relies critically on the modelling of the selection of the sample, which has proven to be a limiting factor. This may change thanks to upcoming uniform high-resolution imaging surveys that cover a large fraction of the sky, because they can provide complete lens samples, with well understood selection criteria. To explore how the observed distribution of Einstein radii depends on the galaxy properties, we simulated a realistic complete sample of strong lenses, predicting a number density of lenses of about 2.5 deg$^{-2}$ for a \Euclid-like setup. Such data can break the degeneracy between the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the inner slope of the density profile of dark matter, without having to rely on additional information from stellar dynamics. We found that a survey covering only 50 deg$^2$ can already provide tight constraints: assuming that the cosmology is known, the dark matter slope is recovered with an uncertainty of $3.5\%$, while the uncertainty in the ratio between the true stellar mass and that inferred from stellar population modelling was found to be $10\%$. These findings highlight the potential of this method when applied to samples of lenses with well-understood selection functions.

2024-06-24, **A new upper limit on the axion-photon coupling with an extended CAST run with a Xe-based Micromegas detector**, CAST Collaboration et.al., [2406.16840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16840v1)

 Hypothetical axions provide a compelling explanation for dark matter and could be emitted from the hot solar interior. The CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) has been searching for solar axions via their back conversion to X-ray photons in a 9-T 10-m long magnet directed towards the Sun. We report on an extended run with the IAXO (International Axion Observatory) pathfinder detector, doubling the previous exposure time. The detector was operated with a xenon-based gas mixture for part of the new run, providing technical insights for future detector configurations in IAXO. No counts are detected in the 95\% signal-encircling region during the new run, while one is expected. The new data improve the axion-photon coupling limit to 5.7$\times 10^{-11}\,$GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\% C.L., the most restrictive experimental limit to date.

2024-06-24, **Modeling of axion and electromagnetic fields coupling in a particle-in-cell code**, Xiangyan An et.al., [2406.16796v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16796v1)

 Axions have aroused widespread research interest because they can solve the strong CP problem and serve as a possible candidate for dark matter. Currently, people have explored a lot of axion detection experiments, including passively detecting the existing axions in the universe, and actively generating axions in the laboratory. Recently, axion-coupled laser-plasma interactions have been discussed as a novel method to detect axions. Petawatt (PW) lasers are considered as a powerful tool to study not only the vacuum polarization but also the axion coupling, due to their extreme fields. However, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation is still missed in current studies, which limits the understanding of axion-coupled laser-plasma interactions. In this paper, we proposed the method to include the axion field and the coupling with electromagnetic (EM) fields in PIC codes. The axion wave equation and modified Maxwell's equations are numerically solved, while the EM field modulation from axions is considered as a first-order perturbation. Meanwhile, different axion field boundary conditions are considered to satisfy different simulation scenarios. The processes of conversions between axions and photons, and weak laser pulse propagation with axion effects are checked as benchmarks of the code. Such an extended PIC code may help researchers develop novel axion detection schemes based on laser-plasma interactions and provide a better understanding of axion-coupled astrophysical processes.

 The recently discovered satellite dwarf galaxy Ursa Major III provides a promising opportunity to explore the signatures resulting from dark matter (DM) annihilation, due to its proximity and large J-factor. Owing to the absence of an excess of $\gamma$-ray signatures originating from Ursa Major III, observations of $\gamma$-rays, such as those from Fermi-LAT, can be utilized to set constraints on the DM annihilation cross section. In this study, we determine the DM density profile, and consider the relationship between DM density and velocity dispersion at different locations within Ursa Major III through Jeans analysis. We calculate the J-factor of Ursa Major III for s-wave annihilation, along with the effective J-factors for p-wave and Sommerfeld enhanced annihilation scenarios. Utilizing these derived J-factors, we set stringent constraints on DM annihilation cross sections in three scenarios. Given the substantial impact of member star identification on the J-factor of Ursa Major III, we further calculate J-factors with the condition of excluding the largest velocity outlier. Our analysis reveals a notable reduction in the median value and an increase in the deviation of J-factors, thereby leading to considerably weaker constraints.

 We perform canonical quantization of the single-component, spin-zero field that was introduced by Dirac in 1971 and recently suggested as a candidate for dark matter by Bogomolny. The massive and massless cases are treated separately. Since in the massive case only positive-frequency modes are normalizable and regarded as physical, the mode expansion for the field involves annihilation operators only, making the quantization procedure particularly simple. The corresponding Hamiltonian of the system turns out to be unambiguous, with no need for normal ordering. The positive-energy requirement imposed on the second-quantized system leads to bosonic commutation relations, in agreement with the spin-statistics theorem. The boson nature of the positive-energy Dirac particles, which, evidently, have no antiparticles, hints at the possibility of a dark, background Bose-Einstein condensate that drives different parts of the universe in the same temporal direction. In the massless case, on the other hand, we explore the possibility of allowing the mode expansion to involve both positive- and negative-frequency components, which leads to the anticommutation relations, resulting in the fermionic behavior of the field in ultrarelativistic limit.

 On the route towards merging neutron stars and stripped-envelope supernovae, binary population synthesis predicts a large number of post-interaction systems with massive stars that have stripped off their outer layers. Yet, observations of such stars in the intermediate-mass regime below the Wolf-Rayet masses are rare. Using X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) data, we discovered three partially stripped star + Be/Oe binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. We analyzed the UV and optical spectra using the PoWR model atmosphere code by superimposing model spectra corresponding to each component. The estimated current masses of the partially stripped stars fall within the intermediate mass range of 4-8 $M\_{\odot}$. These objects are overluminous for their stellar masses, matching core He-burning luminosities. Their Be/Oe secondaries have much higher masses than their stripped primaries (mass ratio > 2). All three partially stripped stars show significant nitrogen enrichment and carbon and oxygen depletion on their surfaces. Additionally, one of our sample stars exhibits significant helium enrichment. Our study provides the first comprehensive determination of the wind parameters of partially stripped stars in the intermediate mass range. The wind mass-loss rates of these stars are found to be on the order of $10^{-7} M\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is over ten times higher than that of OB stars of the same luminosity. Current evolutionary models characterizing this phase typically employ OB or WR mass-loss rates, which underestimate or overestimate stripped stars' mass-loss rates by an order of magnitude. Binary evolution models indicate that the observed primaries had initial masses of 12-17 $M\_{\odot}$, making them potential candidates for stripped-envelope supernovae that form neutron stars. If they survive the explosion, these systems may become Be X-ray binaries and later double neutron stars.

2024-06-25, **A look at the high energy aspects of the supernova remnant G309.8+00.0 with eROSITA and Fermi-LAT**, Miltiadis Michailidis et.al., [2406.17493v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17493v1)

 Supernova remnant (SNR) detection along the Galactic plane poses a number of challenges. The SNR G309.8+00.0 lies exactly on the Galactic plane, with its center coinciding with galactic latitude (b)=0 deg. In this paper we report the first detection of the SNR G309.8+00.0 in X-rays and $\gamma$ rays, using stacked data from the first four consecutive extended ROentgen Survey Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) -- on board the Russian-German Spektrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) -- all-sky surveys (eRASS:4) and $\sim15.5$ yr of Pass 8 data recorded from Fermi-LAT, respectively. The SNR appears to have an elliptical shape of 0.43 x 0.32 deg in size in both radio synchrotron and X-ray data. The SNR's emission exhibits a shell-like morphology and good spatial correlation in both energy bands. The X-ray emission was solely detected in the 1-2 keV energy band (subject to strong absorption at soft X-rays) and the spectral analysis results of eRASS:4 data present a purely thermal SNR with a high absorption column density $3.1\_{-0.5}^{+0.7}\cdot10^{22}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of $0.34\pm0.1$ keV. In combination with optical extinction data, the absorption column density values derived from the remnant's spectral analysis support a remnant's distance greater than 6 kpc, rather than a 3.12 kpc distance as reported in the literature, and yield an age of $1-3.5\cdot10^5$ yr. Employing $\sim15.5$ yr of Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data at and around the remnant's vicinity, we confirm the detection of the to-date unidentified 4FGL J1349.5-6206c source that can either be modeled as a single source or a conglomerate of multiple distinct source components and we argue that the SNR G309.8+00.0 likely represents at least a significant portion (if not all) of the emission from the 4FGL J1349.5-6206c $\gamma$-ray source.

 With the number of supernovae observed expected to drastically increase thanks to large-scale surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), it is necessary that the tools we use to classify these objects keep up with this increase. We previously created Supernova Tagging and Classification (STag) to address this problem by employing machine learning techniques alongside logistic regression in order to assign 'tags' to spectra based on spectral features. STag II is a continuation of this work, which now makes use of model supernova spectra combined with real DESI spectra in order to train STag to better deal with realistic data. We also make use of the rlap score as a trustworthiness cut, making for a more robust and accurate supernova classifier than before.

2024-06-25, **Hybrid isentropic twin stars**, Juan Pablo Carlomagno et.al., [2406.17193v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17193v1)

 We present a study of hybrid neutron stars with color superconducting quark matter cores at finite temperature that results in sequences of stars with constant entropy per baryon, $s/n\_B={\rm const}$. For the quark matter equation of state, we employ a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model while nuclear matter is described with a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class. The phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction under isothermal conditions. We find that traversing the mixed phase on a trajectory at low $s/n\_B\lesssim 2$ in the phase diagram shows a heating effect while at larger $s/n\_B$ the temperature drops. This behavior may be attributed to the presence of a color superconducting quark matter phase at low temperatures and the melting of the diquark condensate which restores the normal quark matter phase at higher temperatures. While the isentropic hybrid star branch at low $s/n\_B\lesssim 2$ is connected to the neutron star branch, it gets disconnected at higher entropy per baryon so that the "thermal twin" phenomenon is observed. We find that the transition from connected to disconnected hybrid star sequences may be estimated with the Seidov criterion for the difference in energy densities. The radii and masses at the onset of deconfinement exhibit a linear relationship and thus define a critical compactness of the isentropic star configuration for which the transition occurs which for large enough $s/n\_B\gtrsim 2$ is accompanied by an instability. The results of this study may be of relevance for uncovering the conditions for the supernova explodability of massive blue supergiant stars by the quark deconfinement mechanism. The accretion-induced deconfinement transition with thermal twin formation may contribute to explaining the origin of eccentric orbits in some binary systems and the origin of isolated millisecond pulsars.

2024-06-24, **The fate of the interstellar medium in early-type galaxies. IV. The impact of stellar feedback, mergers, and black holes on the cold ISM in simulated galaxies**, Jakub Nadolny et.al., [2406.16533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16533v1)

 Removing cold interstellar medium (ISM) from a galaxy is central to quenching star formation. However, the exact mechanism of this process remains unclear. The objective of this work is to find the mechanism responsible for dust and gas removal in simulated early-type galaxies (ETGs). A statistically significant sample of massive (M\_*>$10^{10}$M$\_\odot$), simulated ETG in a redshift range of 0.02--0.32 is studied in the context of its ISM properties. In particular, we investigate the cold dust and gas removal timescales, the cold gas inflows, and their relation with black hole (BH) mass. We also investigate the evolution of galaxies in the dust vs. star formation rate (SFR) plane and the influence of merger events. We find agreement with previous observational works considering the timescales of dust and HI removal from ETGs. When considering the dust-to-stellar mass ratio as a function of time in simulations, we recovered a similar decline as in the observational sample as a function of stellar age, validating its use for timing the ISM decline. Moreover, we recover the observed relation between dust mass and SFR for actively star-forming galaxies as well as for passive ETGs. We also show that starburst galaxies form their own sequence on the dust vs. SFR plot in a form $\log(M\_{\rm dust, SB})= 0.913\times \log({\rm SFR}) + 6.533$ with $2\sigma$ scatter of 0.32. Finally, we find that type II supernova reverse shocks dominate the dust destruction at the early stages of ETG evolution, while at later times stellar feedback becomes more important. We show that merger events lead to morphological transformations by increasing the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio followed by an increase in BH masses. The BH feedback resulting from radio mode accretion prevents the hot halo gas from cooling, indirectly leading to a decrease in the SFR.

2024-06-24, **Stellar Winds**, Jorick S. Vink et.al., [2406.16517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16517v1)

 Stellar winds form an integral part of astronomy. The solar wind affects Earth's magnetosphere, while the winds of hot massive stars are highly relevant for galactic feedback through their mechanical wind energy. In different parts of the stellar HR diagram different forces dominate. On the hot side of the HRD radiative forces on ionised gas particles are active, while on the cool side molecular and dust opacities take over. Moreover, due to the convective envelopes, alternative physical ingredients may start to dominate. I will describe the basic equation of motion and give a few examples, mostly focusing on the winds from massive stars. Here mass-loss rates significantly affect the stellar evolution all the way to core collapse as a supernova and/or black hole formation event.
