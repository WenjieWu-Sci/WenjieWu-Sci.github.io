2023-09-12, **Event-by-Event Direction Reconstruction of Solar Neutrinos in a High Light-Yield Liquid Scintillator**, A. Allega et.al., [2309.06341v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06341v1)

 The direction of individual $^8$B solar neutrinos has been reconstructed using the SNO+ liquid scintillator detector. Prompt, directional Cherenkov light was separated from the slower, isotropic scintillation light using time information, and a maximum likelihood method was used to reconstruct the direction of individual scattered electrons. A clear directional signal was observed, correlated with the solar angle. The observation was aided by a period of low primary fluor concentration that resulted in a slower scintillator decay time. This is the first time that event-by-event direction reconstruction in high light-yield liquid scintillator has been demonstrated in a large-scale detector.

2023-09-12, **Identifying multiwavelength counterparts to astrophysical neutrino events**, Atreya Acharyya et.al., [2309.06164v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06164v1)

 High-energy neutrinos originating in astrophysical sources should be accompanied by gamma-rays at production. Depending on the properties of the emission environment and the distance of the source to the Earth, these gamma-rays may be observed directly, or through the detection of lower energy photons that result from interactions with the intervening radiation fields. In this work, we present an automated tool that aims at using data from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope to identify multiwavelength counterparts to astrophysical neutrino events. The main goal of this tool is to enable prompt follow-up observations with ground-based and space-based observatories in order to help pinpoint the neutrino source.

2023-09-12, **Neutrinos and Heavy Element Nucleosynthesis**, Xilu Wang et.al., [2309.06043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06043v1)

 This chapter discusses three nucleosynthesis processes involved in producing heavy nuclei beyond the iron group that are influenced or shaped by neutrino interactions: the v process, the vp process and the r process. These processes are all related to explosive events involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, where an abundant amount of neutrinos are emitted. The interactions of the neutrinos with nucleons and nuclei through both charged-current and neutral-current reactions play a crucial role in the nucleosynthesis processes. During the propagation of neutrinos inside the nucleosynthesis sites, neutrinos may undergo flavor oscillations that can also potentially affect the nucleosynthesis yields. Here we provide a general overview of the possible effects of neutrinos and neutrino flavor conversions on these three heavy-element nucleosynthesis processes.

2023-09-12, **Environmental radon control in the 700-m underground laboratory at JUNO**, Chenyang Cui et.al., [2309.06039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06039v1)

 The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory is building the world's largest liquid scintillator detector with a 20 kt target mass and about 700 m overburden. The total underground space of civil construction is about 300,000 m$^3$ with the main hall volume of about 120,000 m$^3$, which is the biggest laboratory in the world. Radon concentration in the underground air is quite important for not only human beings' health but also the background of experiments with rare decay detection, such as neutrino and dark matter experiments. The radon concentration is the main hall is required to be around 100 Bq/m$^3$. Optimization of the ventilation with fresh air is effective to control the radon underground. To find the radon sources in the underground laboratory, we made a benchmark experiment in the refuge room near the main hall. The result shows that the radon emanating from underground water is one of the main radon sources in the underground air. The total underground ventilation rate is about 160,000 m$^3$/h fresh air with about 30 Bq/m$^3$ $^{222}$Rn from the bottom of the vertical tunnel after optimization, and 55,000 m$^3$/h is used for the ventilation in the main hall. Finally, the radon concentration inside the main hall decreased from 1600 Bq/m$^3$ to around 100 Bq/m$^3$. The suggested strategies for controlling radon concentration in the underground air are described in this paper.

2023-09-12, **Waveform Reconstruction of Core-Collapse Supernovae Gravitational-Waves with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition**, Yong Yuan et.al., [2309.06011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06011v1)

 The gravitational waves (GW) from core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) have been proposed as a probe to investigate physical properties inside of the supernova. However, how to search and extract the GW signals from core-collapse supernovae remains an open question due to its complicated time-frequency structure. In this paper, we applied the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method to decompose and reconstruct simulated GW data generated by magnetorotational mechanism and neutrino-driven mechanism within the advanced LIGO, using the match score as the criterion for assessing the quality of the reconstruction. The results indicate that by decomposing the data, the sum of the first six intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) can be used as the reconstructed waveform. To determine the probability that our reconstructed waveform corresponds to a real GW waveform, we calculated the false alarm probability of reconstruction (FAPR). By setting the threshold of the match score to be 0.75, we obtained FAPR of GW sources at a distance of 5 kpc and 10 kpc to be $1\times10^{-2}$ and $3\times10^{-2}$ respectively. If we normalize the maximum amplitude of the GW signal to $5\times10^{-21}$, the FAPR at this threshold is $4\times10^{-3}$. Furthermore, in our study, the reconstruction distance is not equivalent to the detection distance. When the strain of GW reaches $7 \times 10^{-21}$, and the match score threshold is set at 0.75, we can reconstruct GW waveform up to approximately 37 kpc.

2023-09-12, **Latest results from Daya Bay using the full dataset**, Zhiyuan Chen et.al., [2309.05989v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05989v1)

 The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment was designed with the primary goal of precisely measuring the neutrino mixing parameter, $\theta\_{13}$. Eight identically-designed gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator detectors installed in three underground experimental halls measure the reactor antineutrinos from six nuclear reactors at different distances. Until its shutdown at the end of 2020, Daya Bay experiment has acquired nearly 6 million inverse beta decay candidates with neutron captured on gadolinium. In this talk, the latest neutrino oscillation analysis results based on full data will be presented. The resulting oscillation parameters are $\sin^{2}2\theta\_{13}$ = 0.0851 $\pm$ 0.0024, $\Delta m^{2}\_{32}$ = (2.466 $\pm$ 0.060) $\times$ $10^{-3}$ ${\rm eV}^{2}$ for the normal mass ordering or $\Delta m^{2}\_{32}$ = -(2.571 $\pm$ 0.060) $\times$ $10^{-3}$ ${\rm eV}^{2}$ for the inverted mass ordering, which are the most precise measurement of $\theta\_{13}$ and $\Delta m^{2}\_{32}$ so far. Moreover, latest results on other topics such as the search of high energy reactor neutrino is included as well.

2023-09-11, **Low-Energy Supernovae Bounds on Sterile Neutrinos**, Garv Chauhan et.al., [2309.05860v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05860v1)

 Sterile neutrinos can be produced through mixing with active neutrinos in the hot and dense core of a core-collapse supernova (SN). The standard bounds on the active-sterile mixing ($\sin^2 \theta$) from SN arise from SN1987A energy-loss, requiring $E\_{\text{loss}}<10^{52}~{\rm erg}$. In this letter, we discuss a novel bound on sterile neutrino parameter space arising from the energy deposition through its decays inside the SN envelope. Using the observed underluminous SN IIP population, this energy deposition is constrained to be below $\sim 10^{50}~{\rm erg}$. Focusing on sterile neutrino mixing only with the tau neutrino, for heavy sterile masses $m\_s$ in the range $100$-$500$ MeV, we find stringent constraints on $\sin^2 \theta\_\tau$ reaching two orders of magnitude lower than those from the SN1987A energy-loss argument. Similar bounds will also be applicable to sterile mixing only with muons ($\sin^2 \theta\_\mu$).

2023-09-11, **The Scale of Stellar Yields: Implications of the Measured Mean Iron Yield of Core Collapse Supernovae**, David H. Weinberg et.al., [2309.05719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05719v1)

 The scale of alpha-element yields is difficult to predict from theory because of uncertainties in massive star evolution, supernova physics, and black hole formation, and it is difficult to constrain empirically because the impact of higher yields can be compensated by greater metal loss in galactic winds. We use a recent measurement of the mean iron yield of core collapse supernovae (CCSN) by Rodriguez et al. (RMN23), $\bar{y}\_{\rm Fe}^{\rm cc} =0.058 \pm 0.007 M\_\odot$, to infer the scale of alpha-element yields by assuming that the plateau of [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios observed in low metallicity stars represents the yield ratio of CCSN. For a Kroupa IMF and a plateau at [alpha/Fe]=0.45, we find that the population-averaged yields of O and Mg per unit mass of star formation are about equal to the mass fractions of these elements in the sun. The inferred O and Fe yields agree with predictions of the Sukhbold et al. (2016) CCSN models assuming their Z9.6+N20 neutrino-driven engine, a scenario in which many progenitors with $M<40M\_\odot$ implode to black holes rather than exploding. The yields are lower than assumed in some models of galactic chemical evolution (GCE) and the galaxy mass-metallicity relation, reducing the level of outflows needed to match observed abundances. For straightforward assumptions, we find that one-zone GCE models with mass-loading factor $\eta\approx 0.6$ evolve to solar metallicity at late times. By requiring that models reach [alpha/Fe]=0 at late times, and assuming a mean Fe yield of $0.7M\_\odot$ per Type Ia supernova, we infer a Hubble-time integrated SNIa rate of $1.1\times 10^{-3} M\_\odot^{-1}$, compatible with estimates from supernova surveys. The RMN23 measurement provides one of the few empirical anchors for the absolute scale of nucleosynthetic yields, with wide-ranging implications for stellar and galactic astrophysics.

2023-09-11, **The role of de-excitation in the final-state interactions of protons in neutrino-nucleus interactions**, Anna Ershova et.al., [2309.05410v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05410v1)

 Present and next generation of long-baseline accelerator experiments are bringing the measurement of neutrino oscillations into the precision era with ever-increasing statistics. One of the most challenging aspects of achieving such measurements is developing relevant systematic uncertainties in the modeling of nuclear effects in neutrino-nucleus interactions. To address this problem, state-of-the-art detectors are being developed to extract detailed information about all particles produced in neutrino interactions. To fully profit from these experimental advancements, it is essential to have reliable models of propagation of the outgoing hadrons through nuclear matter able to predict how the energy is distributed between all the final-state observed particles. In this article, we investigate the role of nuclear de-excitation in neutrino-nucleus scattering using two Monte Carlo cascade models: NuWro and INCL coupled with the de-excitation code ABLA. The ablation model ABLA is used here for the first time to model de-excitation in neutrino interactions. As input to ABLA, we develop a consistent simulation of nuclear excitation energy tuned to electron-scattering data. The paper includes the characterization of the leading proton kinematics and of the nuclear cluster production during cascade and de-excitation. The observability of nuclear clusters as vertex activity and their role in a precise neutrino energy reconstruction is quantified.

2023-09-12, **Dynamical system analysis of cosmological evolution in the Aether scalar tensor theory**, João Luís Rosa et.al., [2309.06232v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06232v1)

 The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of General Relativity (GR), proposed for addressing galactic and cosmological observations without dark matter.The action for the theory includes a function that can currently only be constrained by phenomenological considerations. In antecedent work, forms of this function were considered that led to an effective fluid contribution to the cosmological evolution equations that approximated that of dust more and more closely at late cosmic times. In this work we consider an alternative set of functions that most closely approximate dust at the earliest cosmic times and where deviations from dust-like behaviour gradually emerge with time. We use the dynamical system formalism to analyze example models from both possible sets of functions, introducing a complete set of dynamical variables describing the spacetime curvature, energy density parameters of different matter components, and AeST scalar field, and obtain the dynamical equations describing cosmological evolution. The cosmological phase space is found to feature invariant submanifolds associated to the absence of the matter components, as well as equilibrium states associated with well-known cosmological behaviors e.g. matter, radiation, and cosmological constant dominated epochs. A full numerical integration of the dynamical system is performed for the models and it is shown that each can closely approximate the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model at the level of the cosmic background. Generalizations of the models are considered and it is shown that the new models likely can simultaneously replicate the cosmological successes of cold dark matter whilst satisfying constraints on the theory from the weak-field quasistatic regime.

2023-09-12, **Constraints on the annihilation of heavy dark matter in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with gamma-ray observations**, Xiao-Song Hu et.al., [2309.06151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06151v1)

 Electrons and positrons produced in dark matter annihilation can generate secondary emission through synchrotron and IC processes, and such secondary emission provides a possible means to detect DM particles with masses beyond the detector's energy band. The secondary emission of heavy dark matter (HDM) particles in the TeV-PeV mass range lies within the Fermi-LAT energy band. In this paper, we utilize the Fermi-LAT observations of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies to search for annihilation signals of HDM particles. We consider the propagation of $e^+/e^-$ produced by DM annihilation within the dSphs, derive the electron spectrum of the equilibrium state by solving the propagation equation, and then compute the gamma-ray signals produced by the $e^+/e^-$ population through the IC and synchrotron processes. We do not detect any significant HDM signal. By assuming a magnetic field strength of $B=1\,{\rm \mu G}$ and a diffusion coefficient of $D\_0 = 3\times10^{28}\,{\rm cm^{2}s^{-1}}$ of the dSphs, we place limits on the annihilation cross section for HDM particles. Our results are weaker than the previous limits given by the VERITAS observations of dSphs, but are comparable to those derived from the IceCube observations of dSphs. As a complement, we also search for the prompt $\gamma$-rays produced by DM annihilation and give limits on the cross section in the 10-$10^5$ GeV mass range. Consequently, in this paper we obtain the upper limits on the DM annihilation cross section for a very wide mass range from 10 GeV to 100 PeV in a unified framework of the Fermi-LAT data analysis.

 Various studies have shown that the late acceleration of the universe can be caused by the bulk viscosity associated with dark matter. But recently, it was indicated that a cosmological constant is essential for maintaining Near Equilibrium Conditions (NEC) for the bulk viscous matter during the accelerated expansion of the universe. In the present study, we investigate a model of the universe composed of mixed dark matter components, viscous dark matter (vDM), and inviscid cold dark matter (CDM), in the context of $f(R, T)$ gravity and show that the model predicts late acceleration by satisfying NEC throughout the evolution, without a cosmological constant. We have compared the model predictions with the observational data on Hubble parameter and Type Ia Supernovae.

2023-09-11, **A persistent excess of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses**, Massimo Meneghetti et.al., [2309.05799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05799v1)

 Previous studies have revealed that the estimated probability of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing in observed galaxy clusters exceeds the expectations from the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmological model by one order of magnitude. We aim to understand the origin of this excess by analyzing a larger set of simulated galaxy clusters and investigating how the theoretical expectations vary under different adopted prescriptions and numerical implementations of star formation and feedback in simulations. We perform a ray-tracing analysis of 324 galaxy clusters from the Three Hundred project, comparing the Gadget-X and Gizmo-Simba runs. These simulations, which start from the same initial conditions, are performed with different implementations of hydrodynamics and galaxy formation models tailored to match different observational properties of the Intra-Cluster-Medium and cluster galaxies. We find that galaxies in the Gizmo-Simba simulations develop denser stellar cores than their Gadget-X counterparts. Consequently, their probability for galaxy-galaxy strong lensing is higher by a factor of $\sim 3$. This increment is still insufficient to fill the gap with observations, as a discrepancy by a factor $\sim 4$ still persists. In addition, we find that several simulated galaxies have Einstein radii that are too large compared to observations. We conclude that a persistent excess of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing exists in observed galaxy clusters. The origin of this discrepancy with theoretical predictions is still unexplained in the framework of the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. This might signal a hitherto unknown issue with either the simulation methods or our assumptions regarding the standard cosmological model.

2023-09-11, **Revisiting Cosmological Constraints on Supersymmetric SuperWIMPs**, Meera Deshpande et.al., [2309.05709v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05709v1)

 SuperWIMPs are extremely weakly interacting massive particles that inherit their relic abundance from late decays of frozen-out parent particles. Within supersymmetric models, gravitinos and axinos represent two of the most well-motivated superWIMPs. In this paper we revisit constraints on these scenarios from a variety of cosmological observations that probe their production mechanisms as well as the superWIMP kinematic properties in the early Universe. We consider in particular observables of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background (spectral distortion and anisotropies), which limit the fractional energy injection from the late decays, as well as warm and mixed dark matter constraints derived from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and other small-scale structure observables. We discuss complementary constraints from collider experiments, and argue that cosmological considerations rule out a significant part of the gravitino and the axino superWIMP parameter space.

2023-09-11, **Modeling the orbital histories of satellites of Milky Way-mass galaxies: testing static host potentials against cosmological simulations**, Isaiah B. Santistevan et.al., [2309.05708v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05708v1)

 Understanding the evolution of satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) and M31 requires modeling their orbital histories across cosmic time. Many works that model satellite orbits incorrectly assume or approximate that the host halo gravitational potential is fixed in time and is spherically symmetric or axisymmetric. We rigorously benchmark the accuracy of such models against the FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic simulations of MW/M31-mass halos. When a typical surviving satellite fell in ($3.4 - 9.7\ Gyr$ ago), the host halo mass and radius were typically $26-86$ per cent of their values today, respectively. Most of this mass growth of the host occurred at small distances, $r\lesssim50\ kpc$, opposite to dark-matter-only simulations, which experience almost no growth at small radii. We fit a near-exact axisymmetric gravitational potential to each host at $z=0$ and backward integrate the orbits of satellites in this static potential, comparing against the true orbit histories in the simulations. Orbital energy and angular momentum are not well conserved throughout an orbital history, varying by 25 per cent from their current values already $1.6-4.7\ Gyr$ ago. Most orbital properties are minimally biased, $\lesssim10$ per cent, when averaged across the satellite population as a whole. However, for a single satellite, the uncertainties are large: recent orbital properties, like the most recent pericentre distance, typically are $\approx20$ per cent uncertain, while earlier events, like the minimum pericentre or the infall time, are $\approx40-80$ per cent uncertain. Furthermore, these biases and uncertainties are lower limits, given that we use near-exact host mass profiles at $z=0$.

2023-09-11, **Phase-space simulations of prompt cusps: simulating the formation of the first haloes without artificial fragmentation**, Lurdes Ondaro-Mallea et.al., [2309.05707v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05707v1)

 The first generation of haloes forms from the collapse of the smallest peaks in the initial density field. $N$-body simulations of this process suggest a prompt formation of a steep power-law cusp, but these calculations are plagued by numerical artifacts which casts some doubt on this result. Here, we develop new simulation methods based on the dark matter phase-space sheet approach and present results which are entirely free of artificial clumps. We find that a cusp with density $\rho\propto r^{-1.5}$ is indeed formed promptly, subsequently accreting a more extended halo and participating in the hierarchical growth of later halo generations. However, our simulations also suggest that the presence of artificial clumps just before peak collapse can significantly shallow the inner profiles of the cusps. We use $N$-body simulations with controlled amounts of small-scale power to place a conservative upper limit on the scales affected by artificial clumps. Finally, we used these results to simulate the collapse of the first generation of peaks of various types and in different cosmologies, finding prompt cusps to form in all cases. We conclude that prompt cusps are a generic feature of the collapse of peaks on the free-streaming scale of the initial density field, and their structure can safely be studied using $N$-body simulations provided care is taken to excise the region potentially affected by artificial clumps.

2023-09-11, **Regurgitated Dark Matter**, TaeHun Kim et.al., [2309.05703v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05703v1)

 We present a new paradigm for the production of the dark matter (DM) relic abundance based on the evaporation of early Universe primordial black holes (PBHs) themselves formed from DM particles. We consider a minimal model of the dark sector in which a first-order phase transition results in the formation of Fermiball remnants that collapse to PBHs, which then emit DM particles. We show that the regurgitated DM scenario allows for DM to be either fermions or scalars in the mass range $\sim1$ GeV $- \,10^{16}$ GeV, thereby unlocking parameter space considered excluded.

2023-09-11, **Nested solitons in two-field fuzzy dark matter**, Hoang Nhan Luu et.al., [2309.05694v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05694v1)

 Dark matter as scalar particles consisting of multiple species is well motivated in string theory where axion fields are ubiquitous. A two-field fuzzy dark matter (FDM) model features two species of ultralight axion particles with different masses, $m\_1 \neq m\_2$, which is extended from the standard one-field model with $m\_a \sim 10^{-22}\,{\rm eV}$. Here we perform numerical simulations to explore the properties of two-field FDM haloes. We find that the central soliton has a nested structure when $m\_2 \gg m\_1$, which is distinguishable from the generic flat-core soliton in one-field haloes. However, the formation of this nested soliton is subject to many factors, including the density fraction and mass ratio of the two fields. Finally, we study non-linear structure formation in two-field cosmological simulations with self-consistent initial conditions and find that the small-scale structure in two-field cosmology is also distinct from the one-field model in terms of DM halo counts and soliton formation time.

2023-09-11, **Progress in Direct Measurements of the Hubble Constant**, Wendy L. Freedman et.al., [2309.05618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05618v1)

 One of the most exciting and pressing issues in cosmology today is the discrepancy between some measurements of the local Hubble constant and other values of the expansion rate inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Resolving these differences holds the potential for the discovery of new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology: Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM), a successful model that has been in place for more than 20 years. Given both the fundamental significance of this outstanding discrepancy, and the many-decades-long effort to increase the accuracy of the extragalactic distance scale, it is critical to demonstrate that the local measurements are convincingly free from residual systematic errors. We review the progress over the past quarter century in measurements of the local value of the Hubble constant, and discuss remaining challenges. Particularly exciting are new data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), that is delivering high-resolution near-infrared imaging data to both test for and to address directly several of the systematic uncertainties that have historically limited the accuracy of extragalactic distance scale. We present an overview of our new JWST program to observe Cepheids, TRGB and JAGB stars. For the first galaxy in our program, NGC 7250, the high-resolution JWST images demonstrate that many of the Cepheids observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are significantly crowded by nearby neighbors. Avoiding the more significantly crowded variables, the scatter in the JWST near-infrared (NIR) Cepheid period-luminosity relation is decreased by a factor of two compared to those from HST, illustrating the power of JWST for improvements to local measurements of Ho. Ultimately, these data will either confirm the standard model, or provide robust evidence for the inclusion of additional new physics.

2023-09-11, **Light Dark Matter in a Blazar-heated Universe**, Oindrila Ghosh et.al., [2309.05421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05421v1)

 Prompt emissions from TeV blazars pair produce off the extragalactic background light and the highly energetic resulting pair beams then cascade through inverse Compton scattering to give rise to secondary gamma-rays. Such reprocessed cascade emission that can be associated with individual blazar sources has not been detected thus far. The absence of pair halos around these sources, along with the non-observation of isotropic gamma-ray background excess, seems to suggest that collective plasma effects, such as beam-plasma instabilities, can play a crucial role in alleviating this GeV-TeV tension by transferring the energy from the pair beams into the background plasma of the intergalactic medium (IGM). This has profound implications not only for TeV astrophysics, but also the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field and properties of dark matter (DM). A direct consequence of the instability losses and IGM heating is the modification of thermal history at late times, which suppresses structure formation particularly in baryonically underdense regions, potentially holding a clue towards resolving the small-scale crisis in cosmology. In a blazar-heated universe, the observation of dwarf galaxies and Lyman-$\alpha$ measurements present a favoured mass range for DM candidates such as light axion-like particles.

2023-09-11, **A severe challenge to the MOND phenomenology in our Galaxy**, Man Ho Chan et.al., [2309.05252v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05252v1)

 Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is one of the most popular alternative theories of dark matter to explain the missing mass problem in galaxies. Although it remains controversial regarding MOND as a fundamental theory, MOND phenomenology has been shown to widely apply in different galaxies, which gives challenges to the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model. In this article, we derive analytically the galactic rotation curve gradient in the MOND framework and present a rigorous analysis to examine the MOND phenomenology in our Galaxy. By assuming a benchmark baryonic disk density profile and two popular families of MOND interpolating functions, we show for the first time that the recent discovery of the declining Galactic rotation curve in the outer region ($R \approx 17-23$ kpc) can almost rule out the MOND phenomenology at more than $5\sigma$. This strongly supports some of the previous studies claiming that MOND is neither a fundamental theory nor a universal description of galactic properties.

2023-09-12, **Quasi-stationary tidal evolution with arbitrarily misaligned orbital and stellar angular momenta with a preliminary numerical investigation in the non-dissipative limit**, Pavel Ivanov et.al., [2309.06366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06366v1)

 (Abbreviated) We extend the results of our 2021 paper concerning the problem of tidal evolution of a binary system with a rotating primary component with rotation axis arbitrarily inclined with respect to the orbital plane. Only the contribution of quasi-stationary tides is discussed. Unlike previous studies in this field we present evolution equations derived 'from first principles'. The governing equations contain two groups of terms.   The first group of terms determines the evolution of orbital parameters and inclination angles a 'viscous' time scale. The second group of terms is due to stellar rotation. These terms are present even when dissipation in the star is neglected. Unlike in our 2021 paper we consider all potentially important sources of apsidal precession in an isolated binary, namely precession arising from the tidal distortion and rotation of the primary as well as Einstein precession. We solve these equations numerically for a sample of input parameters, leaving a complete analysis to an accompanying paper. Periodic changes to both the inclination of the rotational axis and its precession rate are found. For a particular binary parameters periodic flips between prograde and retrograde rotation are possible. Also, when the inclination angle is allowed to vary, libration of the apsidal angle becomes possible. Furthermore, when the spin angular momentum is larger than the orbital angular momentum there is a possibility of a significant periodic eccentricity changes.   These phenomena could, in principle, be observed in systems with relatively large inclinations and eccentricities such as e.g. those containing a compact object. In such systems both large inclinations and eccentricities could be generated as a result of a kick applied to the compact object during a supernova explosion.

2023-09-12, **The Three Hundred: $M_{sub}-V_{circ}$ relation**, Atulit Srivastava et.al., [2309.06187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06187v1)

 In this study, we investigate a recent finding based on strong lensing observations, which suggests that the sub-halos observed in clusters exhibit greater compactness compared to those predicted by $\Lambda$CDM simulations. To address this discrepancy, we performed a comparative analysis by comparing the cumulative mass function of sub-halos and the $M\_{\text{sub}}$-$V\_{\text{circ}}$ relation between observed clusters and 324 simulated clusters from The Three Hundred project, focusing on re-simulations using GADGET-X and GIZMO-SIMBA baryonic models. The sub-halos' cumulative mass function of the GIZMO-SIMBA simulated clusters agrees with observations, while the GADGET-X simulations exhibit discrepancies in the lower sub-halo mass range possibly due to its strong SuperNova feedback. Both GADGET-X and GIZMO-SIMBA simulations demonstrate a redshift evolution of the sub-halo mass function and the $V\_{max}$ function, with slightly fewer sub-halos observed at lower redshifts. Neither the GADGET-X nor GIZMO-SIMBA(albeit a little closer) simulated clusters' predictions for the $M\_{\text{sub}}$-$V\_{\text{circ}}$ relation align with the observational result. Further investigations on the correlation between sub-halo/halo properties and the discrepancy in the $M\_{\text{sub}}$-$V\_{\text{circ}}$ relation reveals that the sub-halo's half mass radius and galaxy stellar age, the baryon fraction and sub-halo distance from the cluster's centre, as well as the halo relaxation state play important roles on this relation. Nevertheless, we think it is still challenging in accurately reproducing the observed $M\_{\text{sub}}$-$V\_{\text{circ}}$ relation in our current hydrodynamic cluster simulation under the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

 Various studies have shown that the late acceleration of the universe can be caused by the bulk viscosity associated with dark matter. But recently, it was indicated that a cosmological constant is essential for maintaining Near Equilibrium Conditions (NEC) for the bulk viscous matter during the accelerated expansion of the universe. In the present study, we investigate a model of the universe composed of mixed dark matter components, viscous dark matter (vDM), and inviscid cold dark matter (CDM), in the context of $f(R, T)$ gravity and show that the model predicts late acceleration by satisfying NEC throughout the evolution, without a cosmological constant. We have compared the model predictions with the observational data on Hubble parameter and Type Ia Supernovae.

 We report the extended GeV $\gamma$-ray emission around the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant (SNR) DA 530 with the PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). The $\gamma$-ray spectrum in the energy range of 100 MeV - 1 TeV follows a power law model with an index of 2.23. The much more extended $\gamma$-ray emission than the radio shell of DA 530 and the spatial coincidence with the molecular cloud suggest that the $\gamma$-ray emission could be originated from the hadronic process, where the high energy protons are accelerated in and escaped from the shock of DA 530. With a steady-state injection model of protons, the $\gamma$-ray spectrum can be well fitted with the typical Galactic value for diffusion coefficient and the low energy content of the total escaped protons.

 The LambdaCDM model is the most commonly accepted framework in modern cosmology. However, the local measurements of the Hubble constant, H0, via the Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) calibrated on Cepheids provide a value which is in significant disagreement, from 4 to 6 sigma, with the value of H0 inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observed by Planck. This disagreement is the so-called Hubble constant tension. To find out the reason for this discrepancy, we analyze the behaviour of the H0 in the Pantheon sample of SNe Ia through a binning approach: we divide the Pantheon into 3 and 4 bins ordered with redshift (z), and for each of them, we estimate the H0. After the H0 estimation, we fit the H0 values with a decreasing function of z, finding out that H0 undergoes a slow decreasing trend compatible with the evolution scenario in 2.0 sigma. [...] Together with SNe Ia, more astrophysical probes such as quasars (QSO) [...] and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) [...], are needed to tackle the H0 tension. In the realm of GRB-cosmology, one of the most promising correlations is the fundamental plane relation [...]. In the context of applying this relation as a cosmological tool, we also compute how many GRBs must be gathered to reach the same precision as the SNe Ia. Since we are about two decades away from reaching such precision, we also attempt to find additional correlations for the GRBs associated with SNe Ibc that could be exploited to standardize the class of GRB-SNe Ibc in the future. We find a hint of a correlation between the GRBs' end-of-plateau optical luminosity and the SNe's rest-frame peak time, suggesting that the GRBs with the most luminous optical plateau emission are associated with SNe with the most delayed peaks in their light curves. So far, it is the fundamental plane relation to be the most promising candle for exploring the high-z universe.

2023-09-11, **Not empty enough: a local void cannot solve the $H_0$ tension**, Dragan Huterer et.al., [2309.05749v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05749v1)

 We review arguably the simplest solution for the Hubble tension -- the possibility that we live in a void. In this scenario, the local Hubble constant $H\_0$ is higher than the global value, thus potentially explaining why $H\_0$ measured locally by the distance ladder including Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) would be larger than the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background and other cosmological probes. In addition, since the local supernova sample is sparse and highly inhomogeneous, the error bars in the local Hubble constant might be larger than previously estimated. These two effects -- local matter density and sample inhomogeneity -- constitute the sample variance (or the cosmic variance) of the local Hubble constant measurements. To investigate these effects explicitly, we have mocked up SNIa observations by exactly matching their actual spatial distribution in a large N-body simulation. We have then investigated whether the sample variance is large enough to explain the Hubble tension. The answer is resoundingly negative: the typical local variation in $H\_0$ is far smaller than what would be required to explain the Hubble tension; the latter would require a 20-$\sigma$ deviation from the expected sample variance. Equivalently, the void required to explain the Hubble tension would need to be so empty ($\delta\approx-0.8$ on a scale 120 $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) that it would be incompatible with the large-scale structure in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. Therefore, the possibility that we live in a void does not come close to explaining the Hubble tension.

 The analysis of the elemental abundances in galaxy clusters offers valuable insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies. In this study, we explore the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium (ICM) in the Ophiuchus cluster by utilizing {\it XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn observations. We explore the radial profiles of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe. Due to the high absorption of the system, we have obtained only upper limits for O, Ne, Mg, and Ni. We model the X/Fe ratio profiles with a linear combination of core-collapse supernovae (SNcc) and type~Ia supernovae (SNIa) models. We found a flat radial distribution of SNIa ratio over the total cluster enrichment $10-30\%$ for all radii. However, the absence of light $\alpha$-elements abundances may lead to over-estimation of the SNcc contribution.

2023-09-11, **Amalgame: Cosmological Constraints from the First Combined Photometric Supernova Sample**, Brodie Popovic et.al., [2309.05654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05654v1)

 Future constraints of cosmological parameters from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) will depend on the use of photometric samples, those samples without spectroscopic measurements of the SNe Ia. There is a growing number of analyses that show that photometric samples can be utilised for precision cosmological studies with minimal systematic uncertainties. To investigate this claim, we perform the first analysis that combines two separate photometric samples, SDSS and Pan-STARRS, without including a low-redshift anchor. We evaluate the consistency of the cosmological parameters from these two samples and find they are consistent with each other to under $1\sigma$. From the combined sample, named Amalgame, we measure $\Omega\_M = 0.328 \pm 0.024$ with SN alone in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $\Omega\_M = 0.330 \pm 0.018$ and $w = -1.016^{+0.055}\_{-0.058}$ when combining with a Planck data prior and a flat $w$CDM model. These results are consistent with constraints from the Pantheon+ analysis of only spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia, and show that there are no significant impediments to analyses of purely photometric samples of SNe Ia.

2023-09-11, **Implications for the Explosion Mechanism of Type Ia Supernovae from their Late-time Spectra**, Jialian Liu et.al., [2309.05538v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05538v1)

 Late-time spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are important in clarifying the physics of their explosions, as they provide key clues to the inner structure of the exploding white dwarfs. We examined late-time optical spectra of 36 SNe Ia, including five from our own project (SNe 2019np, 2019ein, 2021hpr, 2021wuf, and 2022hrs), with phase coverage of $\sim 200$ to $\sim 400$ days after maximum light. At this late phase, the outer ejecta have become transparent and the features of inner iron-group elements emerge in the spectra. Based on multicomponent Gaussian fits and reasonable choices for the pseudocontinuum around Ni and Fe emission features, we get reliable estimates of the Ni to Fe ratio, which is sensitive to the explosion models of SNe Ia. Our results show that the majority (about 67%) of our SNe Ia are more consistent with the sub-Chandrasekhar-mass (i.e., double-detonation) model, although they could be affected by evolutionary or ionisation effects. Moreover, we find that the Si II $\lambda$6355 velocity measured around the time of maximum light tends to increase with the Ni to Fe ratio for the subsample with either redshifted or blueshifted nebular velocities, suggesting that progenitor metallicity might play an important role in accounting for the observed velocity diversity of SNe Ia.

2023-09-11, **Diagnosis of Circumstellar Matter Structure in Type IIn Supernovae with Hydrogen Line Feature**, Ayako T. Ishii et.al., [2309.05344v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05344v1)

 Some supernovae (SNe), such as Type IIn SNe, are powered by collision of the SN ejecta with a dense circumstellar matter (CSM). Their emission spectra show characteristic line shapes of combined broad emission and narrow P-Cyg lines, which should closely relate to the CSM structure and the mass-loss mechanism that creates the dense CSM. We quantitatively investigate the relationship between the line shape and the CSM structure by Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, considering two representative cases of dense CSM formed by steady and eruptive mass loss. Comparing the H$\alpha$ emission between the two cases, we find that a narrow P-Cyg line appears in the eruptive case while it does not appear in the steady case, due to the difference in the velocity gradient in the dense CSM. We also reproduce the blue-shifted photon excess observed in some SNe IIn, which is formed by photon transport across the shock wave and find the relationship between the velocity of the shocked matter and the amount of the blue shift of the photon excess. We conclude that the presence or absence of narrow P-Cyg lines can distinguish the mass loss mechanism, and suggest high-resolution spectroscopic observations with $\lambda/ \Delta \lambda \gtrsim 10^4$ after the light curve peak for applying this diagnostic method.
