2024-01-03, **Light thermal dark matter via type-I seesaw portal**, Debasish Borah et.al., [2401.01639v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01639v1)

 We propose a minimal scenario for light thermal dark matter (DM) in sub-GeV to GeV ballpark by incorporating a scalar singlet DM in a type-I seesaw scenario extended by an additional Higgs doublet $\phi\_2$. The latter permits efficient annihilation of light scalar DM into leptonic final states including right-handed neutrinos (RHN). While DM annihilation into charged lepton final states is kept either suppressed or in a kinematically forbidden ballpark to avoid cosmic microwave background (CMB) bounds, the RHN, active neutrino final states remain safe from such bounds even if they are allowed kinematically. We discuss the interplay of forbidden and non-forbidden channels in generating light thermal DM relic while incorporating constraints from cosmology as well as laboratory experiments. The model can also explain the anomalous magnetic moment of muon, W-mass anomaly and saturate experimental bounds on charged lepton flavour violation and DM direct detection while offering tantalising detection prospects of the lightest RHN, the mass of which is kept in the same ballpark as DM.

2024-01-03, **Exploration of the Muon $g-2$ and Light Dark Matter explanations in NA64 with the CERN SPS high energy muon beam**, Yu. M. Andreev et.al., [2401.01708v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01708v1)

 We report on a search for a new $Z'$ ($L\_\mu-L\_\tau$) vector boson performed at the NA64 experiment employing a high energy muon beam and a missing energy-momentum technique. Muons from the M2 beamline at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron with a momentum of 160 GeV/c are directed to an active target. A signal event is a single scattered muon with momentum $<$ 80 GeV/c in the final state, accompanied by missing energy, i.e. no detectable activity in the downstream calorimeters. For a total statistic of $(1.98\pm0.02)\times10^{10}$ muons on target, no event is observed in the expected signal region. This allows us to set new limits on part of the remaining $(m\_{Z'},\ g\_{Z'})$ parameter space which could provide an explanation for the muon $(g-2)\_\mu$ anomaly. Additionally, our study excludes part of the parameter space suggested by the thermal Dark Matter relic abundance. Our results pave the way to explore Dark Sectors and light Dark Matter with muon beams in a unique and complementary way to other experiments.

2024-01-03, **Radon Removal Commissioning of the PandaX-4T Cryogenic Distillation System**, Xiangyi Cui et.al., [2401.01638v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01638v1)

 The PandaX-4T distillation system, designed for the removal of krypton and radon from xenon, was evaluated for its radon removal efficiency using a $^{222}$Rn source during the online distillation process. The PandaX-4T dark matter detector was employed to monitor the temporal evolution of radon activity. To determine the radon reduction factor, the experimental data of radon atoms introduced into and bypassed the distillation system was compared. The results indicate that, the PandaX-4T distillation system achieved a radon reduction factor exceeding 190 at a flow rate of 10 slpm and a reflux ratio of 1.44. Gas-only online distillation process of a flow rate of 20 slpm was also conducted, without observing significant reduction of radon levels in the detector. This observation suggests that the migration flow of radon atoms from the liquid phase to the gas phase is limited, and the flow rate and duration of the process may be insignificant compared to the total xenon mass of 6 tons. This study provides the evidence supporting the efficient removal of radon using cryogenic distillation systems. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the distillation method could control radon background levels effectively in liquid xenon-based experiments.

2024-01-03, **Explaining supernova remnant G352.7-0.1 as a peculiar type Ia supernova inside a planetary nebula**, Noam Soker et.al., [2401.01707v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01707v1)

 I identify a point-symmetric morphology of the supernova remnant (SNR) G352.7-0.1 and propose that the outer axially-symmetric structure is the remnant of a common envelope evolution (CEE) of the progenitor system, while the inner structure is the ejecta of a thermonuclear explosion triggered by the merger of a white dwarf (WD) and the core of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The main radio structure of SNR G352.7-0.1 forms an outer (large) ellipse. The bright X-ray emitting gas forms a smaller ellipse with a symmetry axis inclined to the symmetry axis of the large radio ellipse. The high abundance of iron and the energy of its X-ray lines suggest a type Ia supernova (SN Ia). The massive swept-up gas suggests a relatively massive progenitor system. I propose a scenario with progenitors of initial masses of M1=5-7Mo and M2=4-5 Mo. At a later phase, the WD remnant of the primary star and the AGB secondary star experience a CEE that ejects the circumstellar material that swept up more ISM to form the large elliptical radio structure. An explosion during the merger of the WD with the core of the AGB star triggered a super-Chandrasekhar thermonuclear explosion that formed the inner structure that is bright in X-ray. A tertiary star in the system caused the misalignment of the two symmetry axes. This study adds to the rich variety of evolutionary routes within the different scenarios of normal and peculiar SNe Ia.

2024-01-03, **Prospects of constraining $f(T)$ gravity with the third-generation gravitational-wave detectors**, Ran Chen et.al., [2401.01567v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01567v1)

 Mergers of binary compact objects, accompanied with electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, offer excellent opportunities to explore varied cosmological models, since gravitational waves (GW) and EM counterparts always carry the information of luminosity distance and redshift, respectively. $f(T)$ gravity, which alters the background evolution and provides a friction term in the propagation of GW, can be tested by comparing the modified GW luminosity distance with the EM luminosity distance. Considering the third-generation gravitational-wave detectors, Einstein Telescope and two Cosmic Explorers, we simulate a series of GW events of binary neutron stars (BNS) and neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) binary with EM counterparts. These simulations can be used to constrain $f(T)$ gravity (specially the Power-law model $f(T)=T+\alpha(-T)^\beta$ in this work) and other cosmological parameters, such as $\beta$ and Hubble constant. In addition, combining simulations with current observations of type Ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations, we obtain tighter limitations for $f(T)$ gravity. We find that the estimated precision significantly improved when all three data sets are combined ($\Delta \beta \sim 0.03$), compared to analyzing the current observations alone ($\Delta \beta \sim 0.3$). Simultaneously, the uncertainty of the Hubble constant can be reduced to approximately $1\%$.

2024-01-03, **Observations favor the redshift-evolutionary $L_X$-$L_{UV}$ relation of quasars from copula**, Bao Wang et.al., [2401.01540v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01540v1)

 We compare, with data from the quasars, the Hubble parameter measurements, and the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, three different relations between X-ray luminosity ($L\_X$) and ultraviolet luminosity ($L\_{UV}$) of quasars. These three relations consist of the standard and two redshift-evolutionary $L\_X$-$L\_{UV}$ relations which are constructed respectively by considering a redshift dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars and using the statistical tool called copula. By employing the PAge approximation for a cosmological-model-independent description of the cosmic background evolution and dividing the quasar data into the low-redshift and high-redshift parts, we find that the constraints on the PAge parameters from the low-redshift and high-redshift data, which are obtained with the redshift-evolutionary relations, are consistent with each other, while they are not when the standard relation is considered. If the data are used to constrain the coefficients of the relations and the PAge parameters simultaneously, then the observations support the redshift-evolutionary relations at more than $3\sigma$. The Akaike and Bayes information criteria indicate that there is strong evidence against the standard relation and mild evidence against the redshift-evolutionary relation constructed by considering a redshift dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars. This suggests that the redshift-evolutionary $L\_X$-$L\_{UV}$ relation of quasars constructed from copula is favored by the observations.
