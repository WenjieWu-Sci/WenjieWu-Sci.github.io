2024-10-22, **Quantifying the Impact of the Si/O Interface in CCSN Explosions Using the Force Explosion Condition**, Luca Boccioli et.al., [2410.17232v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17232v1)

 The explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova is a complex interplay between neutrino heating and cooling (including the effects of neutrino-driven convection), the gravitational potential, and the ram pressure of the infalling material. To analyze the post-bounce phase of a supernova, one can use the generalized Force Explosion Condition (FEC+), which succinctly formalizes the interplay among these four phenomena in an analytical condition, consistent with realistic simulations. In this paper, we use the FEC+ to study the post-bounce phase of 341 spherically symmetric simulations, where convection is included through a time-dependent mixing length approach. We find that the accretion of the Si/O interface through the expanding shock can significantly change the outcome of the supernova by driving the FEC+ above the explosion threshold. We systematically explore this by (i) artificially smoothing the pre-supernova density profile, and (ii) artificially varying the mixing length. In both cases, we find that large-enough density contrasts at the Si/O interface lead to successful shock revival only if the FEC+ is already close to the explosion threshold. Furthermore, we find that the accretion of the Si/O interface has a substantial effect on the critical condition for supernova explosions, contributing between 5\% and 15\%, depending on how pronounced the density contrast at the interface is. Earlier studies showed that convection affects the critical condition by 25--30\%, which demonstrates that the accretion of the Si/O interface through the shock can play a nearly comparable role in influencing shock dynamics.

2024-10-22, **The XLZD Design Book: Towards the Next-Generation Liquid Xenon Observatory for Dark Matter and Neutrino Physics**, XLZD Collaboration et.al., [2410.17137v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17137v1)

 This report describes the experimental strategy and technologies for a next-generation xenon observatory sensitive to dark matter and neutrino physics. The detector will have an active liquid xenon target mass of 60-80 tonnes and is proposed by the XENON-LUX-ZEPLIN-DARWIN (XLZD) collaboration. The design is based on the mature liquid xenon time projection chamber technology of the current-generation experiments, LZ and XENONnT. A baseline design and opportunities for further optimization of the individual detector components are discussed. The experiment envisaged here has the capability to explore parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter down to the neutrino fog, with a 3$\sigma$ evidence potential for the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections as low as $3\times10^{-49}\rm cm^2$ (at 40 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass). The observatory is also projected to have a 3$\sigma$ observation potential of neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{136}$Xe at a half-life of up to $5.7\times 10^{27}$ years. Additionally, it is sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos from the atmosphere, sun, and galactic supernovae.

2024-10-22, **Dark Matter Search Results from 4.2 Tonne-Years of Exposure of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) Experiment**, J. Aalbers et.al., [2410.17036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17036v1)

 We report results of a search for nuclear recoils induced by weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter using the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) two-phase xenon time projection chamber. This analysis uses a total exposure of $4.2\pm0.1$ tonne-years from 280 live days of LZ operation, of which $3.3\pm0.1$ tonne-years and 220 live days are new. A technique to actively tag background electronic recoils from $^{214}$Pb $\beta$ decays is featured for the first time. Enhanced electron-ion recombination is observed in two-neutrino double electron capture decays of $^{124}$Xe, representing a noteworthy new background. After removal of artificial signal-like events injected into the data set to mitigate analyzer bias, we find no evidence for an excess over expected backgrounds. World-leading constraints are placed on spin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross sections for masses $\geq$9 GeV/$c^2$. The strongest SI exclusion set is $2.1\times10^{-48}$ cm$^{2}$ at the 90% confidence level at a mass of 36 GeV/$c^2$, and the best SI median sensitivity achieved is $5.0\times10^{-48}$ cm$^{2}$ for a mass of 40 GeV/$c^2$.

2024-10-22, **Develop monitors for MW-power proton beam at J-PARC extraction beamline for neutrino experiments**, Son Cao et.al., [2410.16679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16679v1)

 Intense and well-characterized neutrino sources, coupled with large and high-performance detectors, are essential for elucidating the unknowns in leptonic mixing through neutrino oscillation measurements. The J-PARC accelerator and neutrino extraction beamline have recently undergone upgrades, successfully delivering an 800-kW beam. We discuss the development, recent findings, and outstanding challenges associated with a non-destructive beam-induced fluorescence monitor and optical-fiber-based beam loss monitors.

2024-10-22, **Thermal evolution of dark matter in the early universe from a symplectic glueball model**, Mattia Bruno et.al., [2410.17122v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17122v1)

 The hypothesis that dark matter could be a bound state of a strongly coupled non-Abelian gauge theory is theoretically appealing and has a variety of interesting phenomenological implications. In particular, an interpretation of dark matter as the lightest glueball state in the spectrum of a dark Yang-Mills theory, possibly coupled to the visible sector only through gravitational interactions, has been discussed quite extensively in the literature, but most of previous work has been focused on dark SU(N) gauge theories. In this article, we consider an alternative model, based on a symplectic gauge group, which has a first-order confinement/deconfinement phase transition at a finite critical temperature. We first determine the equation of state of this theory, focusing on temperatures close to the transition, and evaluating the associated latent heat. Then we discuss the evolution of this dark-matter model in the early universe, commenting on the mechanisms by which it could indirectly interact with the visible sector, on the spectrum of gravitational waves it could produce, and on the relic abundances it would lead to. Our discussion includes an extensive review of relevant literature, a number of comments on similarities and differences between our model and dark SU(N) gauge theories, as well as some possible future extensions of the present study.

2024-10-22, **Modified Uncertainty Principle with Cosmological Constant: More Insights on Dark Energy and Chandrasekhar Limit**, S. Ahmadi et.al., [2410.17080v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17080v1)

 Numerous studies have shown that generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) removes the Chandrasekhar limit, which can be restored using a negative GUP parameter. This study indicates that observational phantom dark energy also requires an extended uncertainty principle (EUP) parameter with the opposite sign. Altering the signs of the GUP and EUP parameters without a physical rationale is questionable. We demonstrate that incorporating cosmological constant in a modified uncertainty principle (MUP) can address the sign change in GUP and EUP within a unified framework. The main advantage of MUP is that the sign change of the cosmological constant is acceptable and geometrically meaningful. To achieve this, we first derive a modified equation of state from the MUP framework and second test it with observational data for dark matter and dark energy. Importantly, the proposed MUP parameter, which is proportional to the cosmological constant with positive and negative signs, aligns with dark energy observations and restores the Chandrasekhar limit for stars. Finally, we will show that the Chandrasekhar mass limit provides an upper bound of \(\leq 10^{-32}{\rm m^{-2}}\) for the cosmological constant, consistent with the observational value of \(\Lambda\_{\rm obs}=10^{-52}{\rm m^{-2}}\).

2024-10-22, **Comparison of the Migdal transition probabilities in electron-atom inelastic cross sections**, Wakutaka Nakano et.al., [2410.16911v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16911v2)

 The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability. The resultant errors are around $20 \ \%$ for Ar but can be factors for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The calculation is also compared with the cases of Coulomb potential and screened Coulomb potential.

2024-10-22, **Lyman-$Î±$ forest power spectrum and its cross-correlation with dark matter halos in different astrophysical models**, Koichiro Nakashima et.al., [2410.16740v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16740v1)

 The Ly$\alpha$ forest, a series of HI absorption lines in the quasar spectra, is a powerful tool for probing the large-scale structure of the intergalactic medium. Its three-dimensional (3D) correlation and cross-correlations with quasars allow precise measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature and redshift space distortions at redshifts $z>2$. Understanding small-scale astrophysical phenomena, such as star formation and feedback, is crucial for full-shape analyses. In this study, we measure the 3D auto-power spectrum of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and its cross-power spectrum with halos using hydrodynamic simulations from the GADGET3-OSAKA code, which includes models for star formation and supernova feedback. Across five astrophysical models, we find significant deviations from the Fiducial model, with $5-10\,\%$ differences for wavenumbers $k>2\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ in the Ly$\alpha$ auto-power spectrum. The Ly$\alpha\,\times\,$halo cross-power spectra show even larger deviations, exceeding $10\,\%$ in some cases. Using the fitting models of Arinyo-i-Prats et al. (2015) and Givans et al. (2022), we jointly fit the Ly$\alpha$ auto- and Ly$\alpha$ $\times$ halo cross-power spectra, and assess the accuracy of the estimated $f\sigma\_8$ parameter by comparing it with the ground truth from the simulations, while varying the maximum wavenumber $k\_\mathrm{max}$ and minimum halo mass $M\_h$. Our results demonstrate that the extended model of Givans et al. (2022) is highly effective in reproducing $f\sigma\_8$ at $k\_\mathrm{max}\leq3.0\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $M\_h>10^{10.5} M\_\odot$, and remains robust against astrophysical uncertainties.

2024-10-22, **Opacity of Ejecta in Calculations of Supernova Light Curves**, M. Sh. Potashov et.al., [2410.17176v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17176v1)

 The plasma opacity in stars depends mainly on the local state of matter (the density, temperature, and chemical composition at the point of interest), but in supernova ejecta it also depends on the expansion velocity gradient, because the Doppler effect shifts the spectral lines differently in different ejecta layers. This effect is known in the literature as the expansion opacity. The existing approaches to the inclusion of this effect, in some cases, predict different results in identical conditions. In this paper we compare the approaches of Blinnikov (1996) and Friend and Castor (1983) - Eastman and Pinto (1993) to calculating the opacity in supernova ejecta and give examples of the influence of different approximations on the model light curves of supernovae.

2024-10-22, **Towards a unified injection model of short-lived radioisotopes in N-body simulations of star-forming regions**, J. W. Eatson et.al., [2410.17163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17163v1)

 Recent research provides compelling evidence that the decay of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs), such as 26Al, provided the bulk of energy for heating and desiccation of volatile-rich planetesimals in the early Solar System. However, it remains unclear whether the early Solar System was highly enriched relative to other planetary systems with similar formation characteristics. While the Solar System possesses an elevated level of SLR enrichment compared to the interstellar medium, determining SLR enrichment of individual protoplanetary disks observationally has not been performed and is markedly more difficult. We use N-body simulations to estimate enrichment of SLRs in star-forming regions through two likely important SLR sources, stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae. We vary the number of stars and the radii of the star-forming regions and implement two models of stellar wind SLR propagation for the radioisotopes 26Al and 60Fe. We find that for 26Al enrichment the Solar System is at the upper end of the expected distribution, while for the more supernovae dependent isotope 60Fe we find that the Solar System is comparatively very highly enriched. Furthermore, combined with our previous research, these results suggest that the statistical role of 26Al-driven desiccation on exoplanet bulk composition may be underestimated in typical interpretations of the low-mass exoplanet census, and that 60Fe is even less influential as a source of heating than previously assumed.

2024-10-22, **The star formation history of the first bulge fossil fragment candidate Terzan 5**, Chiara Crociati et.al., [2410.16971v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16971v1)

 Context. Terzan 5 and Liller 1 are the only bulge stellar clusters hosting multi-iron and multi-age stellar populations. They are therefore claimed to constitute a novel class of astrophysical objects: the fossils of massive star-forming clumps that possibly sank to the center of the Milky Way and contributed to the formation of the bulge. This is based on the hypothesis that the ancient clumps were able to retain iron-enriched supernova ejecta, later giving rise to younger and more metal-rich populations. Aims. A way to investigate this scenario is reconstructing their star formation histories (SFHs) and proving a prolonged and multi-episode star formation activity. Methods. Leveraging ground- and space-based high-resolution images, we derived the SFH of Terzan 5 by employing the color-magnitude diagram fitting routine SFERA. Results. The best-fit solution predicts an old, main peak occurred between 12 and 13 Gyr ago that generated 70 % of the current stellar mass, followed by a lower-rate star formation activity with two main additional bursts. Conclusions. These results indicate that Terzan 5, similarly to Liller 1, experienced a prolonged, multiepisode star formation activity, fueled by metal-enriched gas deposited in its central regions, in agreement with the expectations of a self-enrichment scenario in a primordial massive clump.

2024-10-22, **Interacting supernovae from wide mass-transferring binaries**, Andrea Ercolino et.al., [2410.16742v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16742v1)

 The light curves and spectra of many Type I and Type II supernovae (SNe) are heavily influenced by the interaction of the SN ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. The observed diversity shows that many progenitors have undergone some level of stripping and polluted their CSM shortly before the explosion. The presence of a binary companion and the mass transfer that can ensue offers a mechanism that can give rise to this diversity. We present a set of detailed massive evolutionary models in which the donor star, a Red Supergiant (RSG) is in a wide orbit around a main-sequence companion, and undergoes stable or unstable mass transfer in the later stages of evolution, up to the moment of core collapse. We also discuss some significant physics of these systems that may impact our results, from the presence of pulsations and extended atmospheres in RSGs, to the initial eccentricity of the orbit. The resulting SN types range from Type IIP to H-deficient IIb and H-free Ib. In models undergoing stable mass transfer, the material lost during this process is expected to form a dense CSM surrounding the system by the time of core collapse and give rise to significant interaction effects in the SN light curve and spectra. In the systems with unstable mass transfer mass transfer, the SN may occur during common-envelope evolution. In this case, the progenitor may show significant variability in the last few thousand years before core collapse, and the following SN will likely exhibit strong interaction effects.

2024-10-22, **The Impact of Initial Composition on Massive Star Evolution and Nucleosynthesis**, Christopher West et.al., [2410.16594v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16594v1)

 We study the sensitivity of presupernova evolution and supernova nucleosynthesis yields of massive stars to variations of the initial composition. We use the solar abundances from Lodders (2009), and compute two different initial stellar compositions: i) scaled solar abundances, and ii) the isotopic galactic chemical history model (GCH) developed by West and Heger (2013b). We run a grid of models using the KEPLER stellar evolution code, with 7 initial stellar masses, 12 initial metallicities, and two for each scaling method to explore the effects on nucleosynthesis over a metallicity range of $-4.0\leq[Z]\leq+0.3$. We find that the compositions from the GCH model better reproduce the weak \emph{s}-process peak than the scaled solar models. The model yields are then used in the OMEGA Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) code to assess this result further. We find that initial abundances used in computing stellar structure have more of an impact on GCE results than initial abundances used in the burn network, with the GCH model again being favored when compared to observations. Lastly, a machine learning algorithm was used to verify the free parameter values of the GCH model, which were previously found by West and Heger (2013b) using a stochastic fitting process. The updated model is provided as an accessible tool for further nucleosynthesis studies.
