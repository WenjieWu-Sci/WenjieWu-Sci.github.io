2023-07-11, **New Measurements of $^{71}$Ge Decay: Impact on the Gallium Anomaly**, J. I. Collar et.al., [2307.05353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05353v1)

 A dedicated high-statistics measurement of the $^{71}$Ge half-life is found to be in accurate agreement with an accepted value of 11.43$\pm$0.03 d, eliminating a recently proposed route to bypass the "gallium anomaly" affecting several neutrino experiments. Our data also severely constrain the possibility of $^{71}$Ge decay to low-energy excited levels of the $^{71}$Ga daughter nucleus as a solution to this puzzle. Additional unpublished measurements of this decay are discussed. Following the incorporation of this new information, the gallium anomaly survives with high statistical significance.

2023-07-11, **Scalar NSI: A unique tool for constraining absolute neutrino masses via $ν$-oscillations**, Abinash Medhi et.al., [2307.05348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05348v1)

 In the standard interaction scenario, a direct measurement of absolute neutrino masses via neutrino oscillations is not feasible, as the oscillations depend only on the mass-squared differences. However, the presence of scalar non-standard interactions can introduce sub-dominant terms in the oscillation Hamiltonian that can directly affect the neutrino mass matrix and thereby making scalar NSI a unique tool for neutrino mass measurements. In this work, for the first time, we constrain the absolute masses of neutrinos by probing scalar NSI. We show that a bound on the lightest neutrino mass can be induced in the presence of scalar NSI at DUNE. We find that the lightest neutrino mass can be best constrained with $\eta\_{\tau\tau}$ and $\eta\_{\mu\mu}$ at $2\sigma$ C.L. for normal and inverted hierarchy respectively. This study suggests that scalar NSI can serve as an interesting avenue to constrain the absolute neutrino masses in long-baseline neutrino experiments via neutrino oscillations.

2023-07-11, **Correlating the CDF $W$-mass shift with the muon $g-2$ and the $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions**, Xin-Qiang Li et.al., [2307.05290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05290v1)

 Motivated by the latest CDF $W$-mass measurement as well as the muon $g-2$ anomaly and the discrepancies observed in $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions, we propose an extension of the Standard Model (SM) with the $SU(2)\_L$-singlet vector-like fermion partners that are featured by additional $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry. The fermion partners have the same SM quantum numbers as of the right-handed SM fermions, and can therefore mix with the latter after the electroweak and the $U(1)^\prime$ symmetry breaking. As a result, desirable loop-level corrections to the $(g-2)\_\mu$, the $W$-boson mass $m\_W$ and the Wilson coefficient $C\_9$ in $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ transitions can be obtained. The final allowed parameter space is also consistent with the constraints from the $Z \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay, the neutrino trident production and the LHC direct searches for the vector-like quarks and leptons.

2023-07-11, **Pulsar kicks in ultralight dark matter background induced by neutrino oscillation**, Geatano Lambiase et.al., [2307.05229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05229v1)

 The interaction of neutrinos with ultralight scalar and vector dark matter backgrounds induce a modification of the neutrino dispersion relation. The effects of this modification are reviewed in the framework of asymmetric emission of neutrinos from the supernova core, and, in turn, of pulsar kicks. We consider the neutrino oscillations, focusing in particular to active-sterile conversion. The ultralight dark matter induced neutrino dispersion relation contains a term of the form $\delta {\bf \Omega}\cdot \hat{{\bf{p}}}$, where $\delta {\bf \Omega}$ is related to the ultralight dark matter field and $\hat{{\bf p}}$ is the unit vector along the direction of neutrino momentum. The relative orientation of ${\bf p}$ with respect to $\delta {\bf \Omega}$ affects the mechanism for the generation of the observed pulsar velocities. We obtain the resonance condition for the active-sterile neutrino oscillation in ultralight dark matter background and calculate the star parameters in the resonance surface so that both ultralight scalar and vector dark matter backgrounds can explain the observed pulsar kicks. The asymmetric emission of neutrinos in presence of ultralight dark matter background results gravitational memory signal which can be probed from the gravitational wave detectors. We also establish a connection between the ultralight dark matter parameters and the standard model extension parameter.

2023-07-11, **Measuring the Sterile Neutrino Mass in Spallation Source and Direct Detection Experiments**, David Alonso-González et.al., [2307.05176v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05176v1)

 We explore the complementarity of direct detection (DD) and spallation source (SS) experiments for the study of sterile neutrino physics. We focus on the sterile baryonic neutrino model: an extension of the Standard Model that introduces a massive sterile neutrino with couplings to the quark sector via a new gauge boson. In this scenario, the inelastic scattering of an active neutrino with the target material in both DD and SS experiments gives rise to a characteristic nuclear recoil energy spectrum that can allow for the reconstruction of the neutrino mass in the event of a positive detection. We first derive new bounds on this model based on the data from the COHERENT collaboration on CsI and LAr targets, which we find do not yet probe new areas of the parameter space. We then assess how well future SS experiments will be able to measure the sterile neutrino mass and mixings, showing that masses in the range 15-50 MeV can be reconstructed. We show that there is a degeneracy in the measurement of the sterile neutrino mixing that substantially affects the reconstruction of parameters for masses of the order of 40 MeV. Thanks to their lower energy threshold and sensitivity to the solar tau neutrino flux, DD experiments allow us to partially lift the degeneracy in the sterile neutrino mixings and considerably improve its mass reconstruction down to 9 MeV. Our results demonstrate the excellent complementarity between DD and SS experiments in measuring the sterile neutrino mass and highlight the power of DD experiments in searching for new physics in the neutrino sector.

2023-07-11, **Observational Constraints on generalized dark matter properties in the presence of neutrinos with final Plank release**, Santosh Kumar Yadav et.al., [2307.05155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05155v1)

 In this paper, we investigate an extension of standard $\Lambda$CDM model by allowing: a temporal evolution in the equation of state (EoS) of DM via Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization, and the constant non-null sound speed. We also consider the properties of neutrinos, such as the effective neutrino mass and the effective number of neutrino species as free parameters. We derive the constraints on this scenario by using the data from the Planck-2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), the local value of the Hubble constant from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and some large scale structure (LSS) information from the abundance of galaxy clusters. We find constraints on the EoS and sound speed of DM very close to the null value in all cases thus no significant evidence can be stated beyond the standard CDM paradigm, and we conclude that the present observational data favor DM as a pressureless fluid. In all cases, we find the tighter upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses. The most tight upper bound is $\sum m\_\nu < 0.17$ eV at 95\% CL, imposed with the addition of HST prior in the analysis. We also observe the effects of neutrino properties on the extended DM parameters and also on other parameters. We find significantly lower mean values of $\sigma\_8$ in all cases which are in agreement with the LSS measurements. Thus, the well-known $\sigma\_8$ tension is reconciled in the considered model.

2023-07-11, **Dissecting the $γ$-ray emissions of the nearby galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 253**, Shunhao Ji et.al., [2307.05142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05142v1)

 Intrigued by recent high-energy study results for nearby galaxies with gamma-ray emission and in particular NGC~1068 that has been detected as a neutrino-emitting source by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we conduct detailed analysis of the $\gamma$-ray data for the galaxies NGC~1068 and NGC~253, obtained with the Large Area Telescope onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope}. By checking for their possible spectral features and then constructing light curves in corresponding energy ranges, we identify flare-like activity from NGC ~1068 in $\geq$2\,GeV energy range and significant long-term variations of NGC~253 in $\geq$5\,GeV energy range. In the former, the emission appears harder in the two half-year flare-like events than that in the otherwise `quiescent' state. In the latter, there is a 2-times decrease in the flux before and after MJD~57023, which is clearly revealed by the test-statistic maps we obtain. Considering studies carried out and models proposed for the $\gamma$-ray emissions of the two sources, we discuss the implications of our findings. The jet in NGC~1068 may contribute to the \gr\ emission. The nature of the long-term variations in NGC~253 is not clear, but the variation part of the emission may be connected to the very-high-energy (VHE) emission of the galaxy and could be verified by VHE observations.

2023-07-11, **Peeking into the next decade in Large-Scale Structure Cosmology with its Effective Field Theory**, Diogo Bragança et.al., [2307.04992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04992v1)

 After the successful full-shape analyses of BOSS data using the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure, we investigate what upcoming galaxy surveys might achieve. We introduce a ``perturbativity prior" that ensures that loop terms are as large as theoretically expected, which is effective in the case of a large number of EFT parameters. After validating our technique by comparison with already-performed analyses of BOSS data, we provide Fisher forecasts using the one-loop prediction for power spectrum and bispectrum for two benchmark surveys: DESI and MegaMapper. We find overall great improvements on the cosmological parameters. In particular, we find that MegaMapper (DESI) should obtain at least a 12$\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) evidence for non-vanishing neutrino masses, bound the curvature $\Omega\_k$ to 0.0012 (0.012), and primordial inflationary non-Gaussianities as follows: $f\_{\text{NL}}^{\text{loc.}}$ to $\pm 0.26$ (3.3), $f\_{\text{NL}}^{\text{eq.}}$ to $\pm16$ (92), $f\_{\text{NL}}^{\text{orth.}}$ to $\pm 4.2$ (27). Such measurements would provide much insight on the theory of Inflation. We investigate the limiting factor of shot noise and ignorance of the EFT parameters.

2023-07-10, **New limits on $W_R$ from meson decays**, Gustavo F. S. Alves et.al., [2307.04862v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04862v1)

 In this letter we show that pseudoscalar meson leptonic decay data can be used to set stringent limits on the mass $m\_{W\_R}$ of a right-handed vector boson, such as the one that appears in left-right symmetric models. We have shown that for a heavy neutrino with a mass $m\_N$ in the range $50<m\_N/{\rm MeV} <1900$ one can constraint $m\_{W\_R} \lesssim (4-19)$ TeV at 90 % CL. This provides the most stringent experimental limits on the $W\_R$ mass to date.

2023-07-10, **Dynamical scoto-seesaw mechanism with gauged $B-L$**, Julio Leite et.al., [2307.04840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04840v1)

 We propose a dynamical scoto-seesaw mechanism using a gauged $B-L$ symmetry. Dark matter is reconciled with neutrino mass generation, in such a way that the atmospheric scale arises \textit{a la seesaw}, while the solar scale is \textit{scotogenic}, arising radiatively from the exchange of ``dark'' states. This way we ``explain'' the solar-to-atmospheric scale ratio. The TeV-scale seesaw mediator and the two dark fermions carry different $B-L$ charges. Dark matter stability follows from the residual matter parity that survives $B-L$ breaking. Besides having collider tests, the model implies sizeable charged lepton flavour violating (cLFV) phenomena, including Goldstone boson emission processes.

2023-07-10, **Atmospheric muons at PeV energies in radio neutrino detectors**, Lilly Pyras et.al., [2307.04736v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04736v1)

 Experiments seeking to detect radio emission stemming from neutrino interactions will soon reach sensitivities that bring a detection within reach. Since experiments like RNO-G or the future IceCube-Gen2 target more than an order of magnitude more effective volume than existing experiments, the renewed and detailed study of rare backgrounds is needed. In this paper, we study the potential background from energy losses of highly energetic atmospheric muons. Due to both limited experimental measurements and limited modeling in hadronic interaction models, the expected event rate is subject to large uncertainties. Here, we estimate rate predictions and their uncertainties for different models and instrumental parameters. We also study possible routes towards mitigation, such as parent air shower detection, and illustrate what is needed to make the first measurement of the prompt muon flux at energies above 10 PeV.

2023-07-10, **Sphaleron in the Higgs Triplet Model**, Jiahang Hu et.al., [2307.04713v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04713v1)

 The Higgs triplet model (HTM) extends the Standard Model (SM) by one complex triplet scalar (also known as the type-II seesaw model), offering a simple and viable way to account for nonzero neutrino masses. On the other hand, the nontrivial couplings of the triplet to the gauge fields and to the SM Higgs field are expected to influence the topological vacuum structure of the SM, and consequently, the energy and the field configuration of the electroweak sphaleron. The sphaleron process plays a crucial role in dynamically generating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this work, we study the vacuum structure of the gauge and Higgs fields and calculate the saddle-point sphaleron configuration in the HTM. The coupled nonlinear equations of motion of the sphaleron are solved using the spectral method. We find the inclusion of the triplet scalar could in principle significantly change the sphaleron energy compared with the SM. Nevertheless, at zero temperature, the current stringent experimental constraint on the vacuum expectation value of the triplet suppresses the difference. Interestingly, we find that there still exists some narrow parameter space where the sphaleron energy can be enhanced up to $30\%$ compared with the SM case.

2023-07-10, **Supercooling in Radiative Symmetry Breaking: Theory Extensions, Gravitational Wave Detection and Primordial Black Holes**, Alberto Salvio et.al., [2307.04694v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04694v1)

 First-order phase transitions, which take place when the symmetries are predominantly broken (and masses are then generated) through radiative corrections, produce observable gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We provide a model-independent approach that is valid for large-enough supercooling to quantitatively describe these phenomena in terms of few parameters, which are computable once the model is specified. The validity of a previously-proposed approach of this sort is extended here to a larger class of theories. Among other things, we identify regions of the parameter space that correspond to the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, PPTA) and others that are either excluded by the observing runs of LIGO and Virgo or within the reach of future gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, we find regions of the parameter space where primordial black holes produced by large over-densities due to such phase transitions can account for dark matter. Finally, it is shown how this model-independent approach can be applied to specific cases, including a phenomenological completion of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ undergoing radiative symmetry breaking.

2023-07-10, **Metastable cosmic strings**, Wilfried Buchmuller et.al., [2307.04691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04691v1)

 Many symmetry breaking patterns in grand unified theories (GUTs) give rise to cosmic strings that eventually decay when pairs of GUT monopoles spontaneously nucleate along the string cores. These strings are known as metastable cosmic strings and have intriguing implications for particle physics and cosmology. In this article, we discuss the current status of metastable cosmic strings, with a focus on possible GUT embeddings and connections to inflation, neutrinos, and gravitational waves (GWs). The GW signal emitted by a network of metastable cosmic strings in the early universe differs, in particular, from the signal emitted by topologically stable strings by a suppression at low frequencies. Therefore, if the underlying symmetry breaking scale is close to the GUT scale, the resulting GW spectrum can be accessible at current ground-based interferometers as well as at future space-based interferometers, such as LISA, and at the same time account for the signal in the most recent pulsar timing data sets. Metastable cosmic strings thus nourish the hope that future GW observations might shed light on fundamental physics close to the GUT scale.

2023-07-10, **The Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein Matter Potential at the One-loop Level in the Standard Model**, Jihong Huang et.al., [2307.04685v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04685v1)

 When neutrinos are propagating in ordinary matter, their coherent forward scattering off background particles results in the so-called Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) matter potential, which plays an important role in neutrino flavor conversions. In this paper, we present a complete one-loop calculation of the MSW matter potential in the Standard Model (SM). First, we carry out the one-loop renormalization of the SM in the on-shell scheme, where the electromagnetic fine-structure constant $\alpha$, the weak gauge-boson masses $m^{}\_W$ and $m^{}\_Z$, the Higgs-boson mass $m^{}\_h$ and the fermion masses $m^{}\_f$ are chosen as input parameters. Then, the finite corrections to the scattering amplitudes of neutrinos with the electrons and quarks are calculated, and the one-loop MSW matter potentials are derived. Adopting the latest values of all physical parameters, we find that the relative size of one-loop correction to the charged-current matter potential of electron-type neutrinos or antineutrinos turns out to be $6\%$, whereas that to the neutral-current matter potential of all-flavor neutrinos or antineutrinos can be as large as $8\%$. The implications of such corrections for neutrino oscillations are briefly discussed.

2023-07-10, **M1 neutrino transport within the numerical-relativistic code BAM with application to low mass binary neutron star mergers**, Federico Schianchi et.al., [2307.04572v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04572v1)

 Neutrino interactions are essential for an accurate understanding of the binary neutron star merger process. In this article, we extend the code infrastructure of the well-established numerical-relativity code BAM that until recently neglected neutrino-driven interactions. In fact, while previous work allowed already the usage of nuclear-tabulated equations of state and employing a neutrino leakage scheme, we are moving forward by implementing a first-order multipolar radiation transport scheme (M1) for the advection of neutrinos. After testing our implementation on a set of standard scenarios, we apply it to the evolution of four low-mass binary systems, and we perform an analysis of ejecta properties. We also show that our new ejecta analysis infrastructure is able to provide numerical relativity-informed inputs for the codes $\texttt{POSSIS}$ and $\texttt{Skynet}$, for the computation of kilonova lightcurves and nucleosynthesis yields, respectively.

2023-07-10, **Exploring Non-Standard Quark Interactions through Solar Neutrino Studies**, Ilídio Lopes et.al., [2307.04557v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04557v1)

 We investigate the effects of a Non-Standard Interaction (NSI) extension of the standard model of particle physics on solar neutrino flavour oscillations. This NSI model introduces a $U\_{Z^\prime}(1)$ gauge symmetry through a $Z^\prime$ boson that mixes with the photon, creating a neutral current between active neutrinos and matter fields via a unique coupling to up and down quarks. The interaction is defined by a single parameter, $\zeta\_o$, which is related to the $Z^\prime$ boson's mass $m\_{Z^\prime}$ and coupling constant $g\_{Z^\prime}$. Notably, this model relaxes the bounds on Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering experiments and fits the experimental values of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon. In this study, we use solar neutrino measurements and an up-to-date standard solar model to evaluate the neutrino flavour oscillations and assess the constraints on $\zeta\_o$. Our study indicates that the NSI model aligns with the current solar neutrino data when $\zeta\_o$ is between $-0.7$ and $0.002$. These models have $\chi^2\_{\nu}$ values equal to or better than the standard neutrino flavor oscillation model, which stands at a $\chi^2\_{\nu}$ of 3.12. The best NSI model comes with a $\zeta\_o$ value of -0.2 and a $\chi^2\_{\nu}$ of 2.96. Including extra data from the Darwin experiment in our analysis refines the range of $\zeta\_o$ values from $-0.7$ to $0.002$, down to $-0.5$ to $-0.002$. These results hint at the possible existence of novel interactions, given that NSI models achieve a comparable or superior fit to the solar neutrino data when contrasted with the prevailing standard model of neutrino flavour oscillation.

2023-07-10, **Distinguishing between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos using temporal correlations**, Bhavya Soni et.al., [2307.04496v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04496v1)

 In the context of two flavour neutrino oscillations, it is understood that the $2\times 2$ mixing matrix is parameterized by one angle and a Majorana phase. However, this phase does not impact the oscillation probabilities in vacuum or in matter with constant density. Interestingly, the Majorana phase becomes relevant when we describe neutrino oscillations along with neutrino decay. This is due to the fact that effective Hamiltonian has Hermitian and anti-Hermitian components which cannot be simultaneously diagonalized (resulting in decay eigenstates being different from the mass eigenstates). We consider the $\cal PT$ symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing two flavour neutrino case and study the violation of Leggett-Garg Inequalities (LGI) in this context for the first time. We demonstrate that temporal correlations in the form of LGI allow us to probe whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana. We elucidate the role played by the mixing and decay parameters on the extent of violation of LGI. We emphasize that for optimized choice of parameters, the difference in $K\_4$ ($K\_3$) for Dirac and Majorana case is $\sim 15\%$ ($\sim 10\%$).

2023-07-10, **Observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Galactic plane**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2307.04427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04427v1)

 The origin of high-energy cosmic rays, atomic nuclei that continuously impact Earth's atmosphere, has been a mystery for over a century. Due to deflection in interstellar magnetic fields, cosmic rays from the Milky Way arrive at Earth from random directions. However, near their sources and during propagation, cosmic rays interact with matter and produce high-energy neutrinos. We search for neutrino emission using machine learning techniques applied to ten years of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We identify neutrino emission from the Galactic plane at the 4.5$\sigma$ level of significance, by comparing diffuse emission models to a background-only hypothesis. The signal is consistent with modeled diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, but could also arise from a population of unresolved point sources.

2023-07-11, **Axions and Cosmic Magnetic Fields**, George B. Field et.al., [2307.05425v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05425v1)

 We argue that if axions are the dark matter, their coupling to electromagnetism results in exponential growth of a helical magnetic field when the axion field first rolls down its potential. After an inverse cascade, the relevant length scales to day are of order 10-100 kpc, of astrophysical interest. Our mechanism for allowing the field to grow relies on a nuance of MHD. Faraday's Law says that an electric field is needed to create a magnetic field. Previous authors relied on conventional Ohm's law to calculate E, but the resistivity is negligible and therefore they assume E is as well. We use a modified Ohm's Law that includes the effects of self-induction in limiting the current driven by a given E, which allows a magnetic field to grow.

2023-07-11, **The filament determination depends on the tracer: comparing filaments based on dark matter particles and galaxies in the GAEA semi-analytic model**, Daria Zakharova et.al., [2307.05240v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05240v1)

 Filaments are elongated structures that connect groups and clusters of galaxies and are visually the striking feature in cosmological maps. In the literature, typically filaments are defined only using galaxies, assuming that these are good tracers of the dark matter distribution, despite the fact that galaxies are a biased indicator. Here we apply the topological filament extractor DisPerSE to the predictions of the semi-analytic code GAEA to investigate the correspondence between the properties of $z=0$ filaments extracted using the distribution of dark matter and the distribution of model galaxies evolving within the same large-scale structure. We focus on filaments around massive clusters with a mass comparable to Virgo and Coma, with the intent of investigating the influence of massive systems and their feeding filamentary structure on the physical properties of galaxies. We apply different methods to compare the properties of filaments based on the different tracers and study how the sample selection impacts the extraction. Overall, filaments extracted using different tracers agree, although they never coincide totally. We also find that the number of filaments ending up in the massive clusters identified using galaxies distribution is typically underestimated with respect to the corresponding dark matter filament extraction.

2023-07-11, **EDGE: The direct link between mass growth history and the extended stellar haloes of the faintest dwarf galaxies**, Alex Goater et.al., [2307.05130v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05130v1)

 Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are commonly found in close proximity to the Milky Way and other massive spiral galaxies. As such, their projected stellar ellipticity and extended light distributions are often thought to owe to tidal forces. In this paper, we study the projected stellar ellipticities and faint stellar outskirts of tidally isolated ultra-faints drawn from the 'Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy Formation's Edge' (EDGE) cosmological simulation suite. Despite their tidal isolation, our simulated dwarfs exhibit a wide range of projected ellipticities ($0.03 < \varepsilon < 0.85$), with many possessing anisotropic extended stellar haloes that mimic tidal tails, but owe instead to late-time accretion of lower mass companions. Furthermore, we find a strong causal relationship between ellipticity and formation time of an UFD, which is robust to a wide variation in the feedback model. We show that the distribution of projected ellipticities in our suite of simulated EDGE dwarfs matches well with that of 21 Local Group dwarf galaxies. Given the ellipticity in EDGE arises from an ex-situ accretion origin, the agreement in shape indicates the ellipticities of some observed dwarfs may also originate from a similar non-tidal scenario. The orbital parameters of these observed dwarfs further support that they are not currently tidally disrupting. If the baryonic content in these galaxies is still tidally intact, then the same may be true for their dark matter content, making these galaxies in our Local Group pristine laboratories for testing dark matter and galaxy formation models.

2023-07-10, **Gauge fixing in cosmological perturbations of Unimodular Gravity**, Francisco X. Linares Cedeño et.al., [2307.04873v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04873v1)

 With focus on the cosmological evolution of linear perturbations of matter and geometry, we calculate the equivalent expressions to that of the Newtonian and Synchronous gauges within the framework of Unimodular Gravity, being these two gauges commonly used and implemented in Boltzmann codes. An important aspect of our analysis is the inclusion of the energy-momentum current violation, as well as its perturbations. Moreover, for the first time we demonstrate that it is possible to fix both gauges consistently, although as it has been already noticed in previous literature, neither of them is recovered in the sense of the dynamics given in General Relativity for matter and metric fluctuations. Specifically, we show that since the unimodular constraint at the level of linear perturbations lead to only one degree of freedom of scalar modes of metric fluctuations, the dynamics in Unimodular Gravity forces to keep the anisotropic stress in the Newtonian gauge, whereas the cold dark matter comoving frame can not be set in the Synchronous gauge. The physical implications on the density contrast of cold dark matter is reviewed, and the Sachs-Wolfe effect is obtained and compared with previous results in the literature of cosmological perturbations in Unimodular Gravity.

2023-07-10, **Galactic wormholes: Geometry, stability, and echoes**, Shauvik Biswas et.al., [2307.04836v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04836v1)

 In this work, we present the environmental effects on wormhole geometries residing in a galaxy through a fully relativistic analysis. In particular, we consider two wormhole spacetimes classes: the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole and the braneworld wormhole. While there is no classical matter model for the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole, the braneworld wormhole, on the other hand, is supported by a scalar-tensor theory on the four-dimensional brane. Intriguingly, it turns out that the presence of a dark matter halo surrounding these wormholes can tame the violations of energy conditions present in generic wormhole spacetimes. Our results also demonstrate that the galactic Damour-Solodukhin wormhole is more stable than its isolated counterpart, whereas we obtain the opposite behavior for the braneworld wormhole. The perturbation of these wormholes leads to echoes in the ringdown waveform, which are sensitive to the properties of the dark matter halo. To be precise, the time delay between two echoes is affected by the galactic matter environment, and it appears to be a generic effect present for any exotic compact object living in a galaxy. This allows us to identify the galactic parameters, independently from the gravitational wave measurements, if echoes are observed in future generations of gravitational wave detectors. For completeness, we have also analyzed the impact of the galactic environment on the photon sphere, the innermost stable circular orbits, and the shadow radius. It turns out that the dark matter halo indeed affects these locations, with implications for shadow and accretion physics.

2023-07-10, **Particle production from non-minimal coupling in a symmetry breaking potential transporting vacuum energy**, Alessio Belfiglio et.al., [2307.04739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04739v1)

 We propose an inflationary scenario where the inflaton field is non-minimally coupled to spacetime curvature and inflation is driven by a vacuum energy symmetry breaking potential without specifying \emph{a priori} whether the inflaton field is small or large. As we incorporate vacuum energy into our analysis, we further explore the implications of a non-zero potential offset in relation to the emergence of inflationary dynamics. Thus, we propose that vacuum energy can transform into particles as a result of the transition triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking. This entails a vacuum energy cancellation that yields an effective cosmological constant during inflation by virtue of a quasi-de Sitter evolution and shows that the vacuum energy contribution can manifest as \emph{geometric particles} produced by inflaton fluctuations, with particular emphasis on super-Hubble modes. We conjecture these particles as \emph{quasi-particles} arising from interaction between the inflaton and spacetime geometry, enhanced by non-minimal coupling. Specifically, we propose that dark matter arises from a pure geometric quasi-particle contribution, and we quantify the corresponding dark matter candidate ranges of mass. In this scenario, we further find that a zero potential offset leads to a bare cosmological constant at the end of inflation, while a negative offset would require an additional kinetic (or potential) contribution in order to be fully-canceled. In this regard, we conclude that the scenario of large field inflaton is preferred since it necessitates a more appropriate selection of the offset. Our conclusion is reinforced as small field inflaton would lead to a significant screening of the Newtonian gravitational constant as inflation ends.

 Strong evidence for the Helling-Downs correlations have been reported by several pulsar timing array collaborations in middle 2023. In this work, we study the state-of-the-art graviton mass bounds by analyzing the observational data of overlap ruduction functions from NANOGrav 15-year data release and CPTA first data release. The data analysis places upper limits on the graviton mass at 95\% confidence level, namely, $m\_{g}\lesssim4.3\times10^{-23}\mathrm{eV}$ for NANOGrav and $m\_{g}\lesssim5.7\times10^{-23}\mathrm{eV}$ for CPTA. In addition, we discuss implications of these results for scenarios of ultralight tensor dark matter.

 We consider a natural asymmetric dark matter (ADM) model in the mirror twin Higgs (MTH). We show that it is possible to obtain the correct dark matter (DM) abundance when a twin baryon is the DM without the need of explicit breaking of the MTH $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ symmetry in the dimensionless couplings (i.e. without hard $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ breaking). We illustrate how this is possible in a specific baryogenesis setup, which also leads to ADM. In the simplest scenario we obtain $m\_{\rm DM}\sim O(1)$~GeV, just above the proton mass. We show estimates for direct detection rates at present and future experiments.

 [abridged] Recently, in Benetti et al. (Astrophys. J. 2023, 949, 65), we suggested that the dark matter (DM) component in galaxies may originate fractional gravity. In such a framework, the DM component exists, but the gravitational potential associated to its density distribution is determined by a modified Poisson equation including fractional derivatives, which are meant to describe nonlocal effects. In Benetti et al., we showed that fractional gravity worked very well for reproducing the kinematics of disk-dominated galaxies, especially dwarfs; there is also preliminary evidence that the strength of fractional effects tends to weaken toward more massive systems. Here, we aim to test fractional gravity in galaxy clusters, with a twofold aim: (i) perform an independent sanity check that it can accurately describe such large and massive structures; (ii) derive a clear-cut trend for its strength in systems with different DM masses. To this purpose, we forward model the density and pressure distributions of the intracluster medium (ICM), working out the hydrostatic equilibrium equation in fractional gravity. Then, we perform a Bayesian analysis of the X-COP galaxy cluster sample and infer constraints on the fractional gravity parameters, for individual clusters as well as stacked clusters. We find that fractional gravity performs remarkably well in modeling the ICM profiles for the X-COP sample. We also confirm the weakening of the fractional gravity effects toward more massive systems and derive the overall scaling of the fractional gravity parameters from dwarf galaxies to massive clusters, spanning six orders of magnitude in DM mass. Such an overall trend implies that fractional gravity can substantially alleviate the small-scale issues of the standard DM paradigm, while remaining successful on large cosmological scales.

 We discuss cosmic domain walls described by a tension red-shifting with the expansion of the Universe. These melting domain walls emit gravitational waves (GW) with the low-frequency spectral shape $\Omega\_{gw}\propto f^{2}$ corresponding to the spectral index $\gamma=3$ favoured by the recent NANOGrav 15 yrs data. We discuss a concrete high-energy physics scenario proposed in Refs. [1,2] which leads to such a melting domain wall network in the early Universe. This scenario involves a feebly coupled scalar field $\chi$, which can serve as a promising dark matter candidate. We identify parameters of the model matching the GW characteristics observed in the NANOGrav data. The dark matter mass is pushed to the ultra-light range below $10^{-11}-10^{-12}\,\text{eV}$ which is accessible through planned observations thanks to the effects of superradiance of rotating black holes.

2023-07-10, **Relieving the $S_8$ Tension: Exploring the Surface-type DBI Model as a Dark Matter Paradigm**, Xingpao Suo et.al., [2307.04394v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04394v2)

 Recent observations of weak gravitational lensing surveys indicate a smoother Universe compared to the predictions of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This is known as $\sigma\_8$ tension or $S\_8$ tension, where $\sigma\_8$ represents the present root-mean-square matter fluctuation averaged over a sphere of radius $8 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$ and $S\_8 \equiv \sigma\_8\sqrt{\Omega\_m/0.3}$. In this letter, we investigate a kind of general Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) Lagrangian referred as surface-type DBI (s-DBI) model. We have found that, up to the linear order, the constraints on the s-DBI model with CMB from Planck2018 and low-redshift probes (WL and GC) yield $S\_8= 0.7685\_{-0.0066}^{+0.0077}$ and $S\_8=0.766\_{-0.0376}^{+0.0471}$, respectively, which are not only self-consistent but also consistent with the values derived from most low-redshift probes. Furthermore, we provide an outlook for searching the non-linear effects of this model, which could be helpful to resolve other issues by Cold Dark Matter on small scales.

 We propose a helium nova model for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) supersoft X-ray source (SSS) [HP99]159. This object has long been detected as a faint and persistent SSS for about 30 years, and recently been interpreted to be a source of steady helium-shell burning, because no hydrogen lines are observed. We find that the object can also be interpreted as in a decaying phase of a helium nova. The helium nova is slowly decaying toward the quiescent phase, during which the observed temperature, luminosity, and SSS lifetime ($\gtrsim 30$ years) are consistent with a massive white dwarf model of $\sim$ 1.2 $M\_\odot$. If it is the case, this is the second discovery of a helium nova outburst after V445 Pup in our Galaxy and also the first identified helium nova in the LMC. We also discuss the nature of the companion helium star in relation to Type Ia supernova progenitors.

 In the next decade, many optical surveys will aim to tackle the question of dark energy nature, measuring its equation of state parameter at the permil level. This requires trusting the photometric calibration of the survey with a precision never reached so far, controlling many sources of systematic uncertainties. The measurement of the on-site atmospheric transmission for each exposure, or on average for each season or for the full survey, can help reach the permil precision for magnitudes. This work aims at proving the ability to use slitless spectroscopy for standard star spectrophotometry and its use to monitor on-site atmospheric transmission as needed, for example, by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time supernova cosmology program. We fully deal with the case of a disperser in the filter wheel, which is the configuration chosen in the Rubin Auxiliary Telescope. The theoretical basis of slitless spectrophotometry is at the heart of our forward model approach to extract spectroscopic information from slitless data. We developed a publicly available software called Spectractor (https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Spectractor) that implements each ingredient of the model and finally performs a fit of a spectrogram model directly on image data to get the spectrum. We show on simulations that our model allows us to understand the structure of spectrophotometric exposures. We also demonstrate its use on real data, solving specific issues and illustrating how our procedure allows the improvement of the model describing the data. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be used to directly extract atmospheric transmission parameters from data and thus provide the base for on-site atmosphere monitoring. We show the efficiency of the procedure on simulations and test it on the limited data set available.

 The nearby face-on star forming spiral galaxy NGC 6946 is known as the Fireworks Galaxy due to its hosting an unusually large number of supernova. We analyze its resolved near-ultraviolet (NUV) stellar photometry measured from images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) with F275W and F336W filters. We model the color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) of the UV photometry to derive the spatially-resolved star formation history (SFH) of NGC 6946 over the last 25 Myr. From this analysis, we produce maps of the spatial distribution of young stellar populations and measure the total recent star formation rate (SFR) of nearly the entire young stellar disk. We find the global SFR(age$\leq$25 Myr)=$13.17 \substack{+0.91 \\-0.79} M\_\odot/\rm yr$. Over this period, the SFR is initially very high ($23.39\substack{+2.43\\-2.11} M\_\odot/\rm yr$ between 16-25 Myr ago), then monotonically decreases to a recent SFR of $5.31\substack{+0.19\\-0.17} M\_\odot/\rm yr$ in the last 10 Myr. This decrease in global star formation rate over the last 25 Myr is consistent with measurements made with other SFR indicators. We discuss in detail two of the most active regions of the galaxy, which we find are responsible for 3% and 5% of the total star formation over the past 6.3 Myr.

2023-07-10, **3D Simulations of Magnetoconvection in a Rapidly Rotating Supernova Progenitor**, Vishnu Varma et.al., [2307.04833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04833v1)

 We present a first 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of oxygen, neon and carbon shell burning in a rapidly rotating 16 M\_sun core-collapse supernova progenitor. We also run a purely hydrodynamic simulation for comparison. After 180s (15 and 7 convective turnovers respectively), the magnetic fields in the oxygen and neon shells achieve saturation at 10^{11}G and 5 x 10^{10}G. The strong Maxwell stresses become comparable to the radial Reynolds stresses and eventually suppress convection. The suppression of mixing by convection and shear instabilities results in the depletion of fuel at the base of the burning regions, so that the burning shell eventually move outward to cooler regions, thus reducing the energy generation rate. The strong magnetic fields efficiently transport angular momentum outwards, quickly spinning down the rapidly rotating convective oxygen and neon shells and forcing them into rigid rotation. The hydrodynamic model shows complicated redistribution of angular momentum and develops regions of retrograde rotation at the base of the convective shells. We discuss implications of our results for stellar evolution and for the subsequent core-collapse supernova. The rapid redistribution of angular momentum in the MHD model casts some doubt on the possibility of retaining significant core angular momentum for explosions driven by millisecond magnetars. However, findings from multi-D models remain tentative until stellar evolution calculations can provide more consistent rotation profiles and estimates of magnetic field strengths to initialise multi-D simulations without substantial numerical transients. We also stress the need for longer simulations, resolution studies, and an investigation of non-ideal effects.

2023-07-10, **The Dragon-II simulations -- III. Compact binary mergers in clusters with up to 1 million stars: mass, spin, eccentricity, merger rate and pair instability supernovae rate**, Manuel Arca Sedda et.al., [2307.04807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04807v1)

 Compact binary mergers forming in star clusters may exhibit distinctive features that can be used to identify them among observed gravitational-wave (GW) sources. Such features likely depend on the host cluster structure and the physics of massive star evolution. Here, we dissect the population of compact binary mergers in the \textsc{Dragon-II} simulation database, a suite of 19 direct $N$-body models representing dense star clusters with up to $10^6$ stars and $<33\%$ of stars in primordial binaries. We find a substantial population of black hole binary (BBH) mergers, some of them involving an intermediate-mass BH (IMBH), and a handful mergers involving a stellar BH and either a neutron star (NS) or a white dwarf (WD). Primordial binary mergers, $\sim 30\%$ of the whole population, dominate ejected mergers. Dynamical mergers, instead, dominate the population of in-cluster mergers and are systematically heavier than primordial ones. Around $20\%$ of \textsc{Dragon-II} mergers are eccentric in the LISA band and $5\%$ in the LIGO band. We infer a mean cosmic merger rate of $\mathcal{R}\sim 12(4.4)(1.2)$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^3$ for BBHs, NS-BH, and WD-BH binary mergers, respectively, and discuss the prospects for multimessenger detection of WD-BH binaries with LISA. We model the rate of pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) in star clusters and find that surveys with a limiting magnitude $m\_{\rm bol}=25$ can detect $\sim 1-15$ yr$^{-1}$ PISNe. Comparing these estimates with future observations could help to pin down the impact of massive star evolution on the mass spectrum of compact stellar objects in star clusters.
