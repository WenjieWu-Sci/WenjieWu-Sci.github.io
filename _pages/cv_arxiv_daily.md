2023-09-14, **Recent Progress in Low Energy Neutrino Scattering Physics and Its Implications for the Standard and Beyond the Standard Model Physics**, V. Pandey et.al., [2309.07840v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07840v1)

 Neutrinos continue to provide a testing ground for the structure of the standard model of particle physics as well as hints towards the physics beyond the standard model. Neutrinos of energies spanning over several orders of magnitude, originating in many terrestrial and astrophysical processes, have been detected via various decay and interaction mechanisms. At MeV scales, there has been one elusive process, until a few years ago, known as coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) that was theoretically predicted over five decades ago but was never observed experimentally. The recent experimental observation of the CEvNS process by the COHERENT collaboration at a stopped pion neutrino source has inspired physicists across many subfields. This has vital implications for nuclear physics, high-energy physics, astrophysics, and beyond. CEvNS, being a low-energy process, provides a natural window to study light, weakly-coupled, new physics in the neutrino sector.   In this review, we intend to provide the current status of low energy neutrino scattering physics and its implications for the standard and beyond the standard model physics. We discuss the general formalism of calculating the tree-level CEvNS cross section and present estimated theoretical uncertainties on the CEvNS cross section stemming from different sources. We also discuss the inelastic scattering of tens of MeV neutrinos that have implications for supernova detection in future neutrino experiments. We discuss how the CEvNS experiments can be used as a testing ground for the Standard Model (SM) weak physics as well as in searching for the Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics signals. Any deviation from the SM predicted event rate either with a change in the total event rate or with a change in the shape of the recoil spectrum, could indicate new contributions to the interaction cross-section.

2023-09-14, **Search for the Prompt Atmospheric Neutrino Flux in IceCube**, Jakob BÃ¶ttcher et.al., [2309.07560v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07560v1)

 For about a decade the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has been observing a high-energy diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. At these energies, an important source of background are the prompt atmospheric neutrinos produced in decays of charmed mesons that are part of cosmic-ray-induced air showers. The production yield of charmed mesons in the very forward phase space of hadronic interactions, and thus the flux of prompt neutrinos, is not well known and has not yet been observed by IceCube. A measurement of the flux of prompt neutrinos will improve the modeling of hadronic interactions in cosmic-ray induced air showers at high energies. Additionally, in the context of astrophysical neutrino measurements, understanding this background flux will improve the measurement precision of the spectral shape in the future. In particular, the analysis of up-going muon neutrino-induced tracks in IceCube provides a large sample of atmospheric neutrinos which likely includes prompt neutrinos. However, the measurement of a subdominant prompt neutrino flux strongly depends on the hypothesis for the dominant astrophysical neutrino flux. This makes the estimation of upper limits on the prompt neutrino flux challenging. We discuss the extent of this model dependency on the astrophysical flux and propose a method to calculate robust upper limits. Furthermore, a possible dedicated search of the prompt neutrino flux using multiple IceCube detection channels is outlined.

2023-09-13, **Real-time Monitoring for the Next Core-Collapse Supernova in JUNO**, Angel Abusleme et.al., [2309.07109v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07109v1)

 Core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is one of the most energetic astrophysical events in the Universe. The early and prompt detection of neutrinos before (pre-SN) and during the SN burst is a unique opportunity to realize the multi-messenger observation of the CCSN events. In this work, we describe the monitoring concept and present the sensitivity of the system to the pre-SN and SN neutrinos at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), which is a 20 kton liquid scintillator detector under construction in South China. The real-time monitoring system is designed with both the prompt monitors on the electronic board and online monitors at the data acquisition stage, in order to ensure both the alert speed and alert coverage of progenitor stars. By assuming a false alert rate of 1 per year, this monitoring system can be sensitive to the pre-SN neutrinos up to the distance of about 1.6 (0.9) kpc and SN neutrinos up to about 370 (360) kpc for a progenitor mass of 30$M\_{\odot}$ for the case of normal (inverted) mass ordering. The pointing ability of the CCSN is evaluated by using the accumulated event anisotropy of the inverse beta decay interactions from pre-SN or SN neutrinos, which, along with the early alert, can play important roles for the followup multi-messenger observations of the next Galactic or nearby extragalactic CCSN.

2023-09-13, **Anomaly-free dark matter models with one-loop neutrino masses and a gauged U(1) symmetry**, T. de Boer et.al., [2309.06920v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06920v1)

 We systematically study and classify scotogenic models with a local U(1) gauge symmetry. These models give rise to radiative neutrino masses and a stable dark matter candidate, but avoid the theoretical problems of global and discrete symmetries. We restrict the dark sector particle content to up to four scalar or fermionic SU(2) singlets, doublets or triplets and use theoretical arguments based on anomaly freedom, Lorentz and gauge symmetry to find all possible charge assignments of these particles. The U(1) symmetry can be broken by a new Higgs boson to a residual discrete symmetry, that still stabilizes the dark matter candidate. We list the particle content and charge assignments of all non-equivalent models. Specific examples in our class of models that have been studied previously in the literature are the U(1)$\_D$ scotogenic and singlet-triplet scalar models breaking to $Z\_2$. We also briefly discuss the new phenomenological aspects of our model arising from the presence of a new massless dark photon or massive $Z'$ boson as well as the additional Higgs boson.

2023-09-13, **Analytic Solution to Neutrino Oscillation in Constant Matter Density, and Fast Algorithm**, James Page et.al., [2309.06900v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06900v1)

 A recently published method for solving the neutrino evolution equation with constant matter density is further refined and used to lay out a fast and accurate algorithm for computing transition and survival probabilities. In particular, the three examples of $\overline{\nu}\_e$ survival, $\overline{\nu}\_\mu$ survival and $\overline{\nu}\_e$ appearance probabilities are written in terms of mixing angles, mass differences and matter electron density. A program based on this new method is found to be roughly twice as fast as, and in agreement with, the leading GLoBES package. Furthermore, the behaviour of all relevant effective parameters is sketched out in terms of a range of neutrino energies, or matter electron densities. For instance, the $\overline{\nu}\_e$ survival probability in constant matter density is found to have no dependence on the mixing angle $\theta\_{23}$ or the CP-violating phase $\delta\_{13}$.

2023-09-13, **Searches for neutrinos in the direction of radio-bright blazars with the ANTARES telescope**, ANTARES Collaboration et.al., [2309.06874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06874v1)

 Active galaxies, especially blazars, are among the most promising neutrino source candidates. To date, ANTARES searches for these objects considered GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray bright blazars. Here, a statistically complete radio-bright blazar sample is used as the target for searches of origins of neutrinos collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope over 13 years of operation. The hypothesis of a neutrino-blazar directional correlation is tested by pair counting and by a complementary likelihood-based approach. The resulting post-trial $p$-value is $3.0\%$ ($2.2\sigma$ in the two-sided convention), possibly indicating a correlation. Additionally, a time-dependent analysis is performed to search for temporal clustering of neutrino candidates as a mean of detecting neutrino flares in blazars. None of the investigated sources alone reaches a significant flare detection level. However, the presence of 18 sources with a pre-trial significance above $3\sigma$ indicates a $p=1.4\%$ ($2.5\sigma$ in the two-sided convention) detection of a time-variable neutrino flux. An \textit{a posteriori} investigation reveals an intriguing temporal coincidence of neutrino, radio, and $\gamma$-ray flares of the J0242+1101 blazar at a $p=0.5\%$ ($2.9\sigma$ in the two-sided convention) level. Altogether, the results presented here suggest a possible connection of neutrino candidates detected by the ANTARES telescope with radio-bright blazars.

2023-09-13, **Spin-flavor precession of Dirac neutrinos in dense matter and its potential in core-collapse supernovae**, Hirokazu Sasaki et.al., [2309.06691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06691v1)

 We calculate the spin-flavor precession (SFP) of Dirac neutrinos induced by strong magnetic fields and finite neutrino magnetic moments in dense matter. As found in the case of Majorana neutrinos, the SFP of Dirac neutrinos is enhanced by the large magnetic field potential and suppressed by large matter potentials composed of the baryon density and the electron fraction. The SFP is possible irrespective of the large baryon density when the electron fraction is close to 1/3. The diagonal neutrino magnetic moments that are prohibited for Majorana neutrinos enable the spin precession of Dirac neutrinos without any flavor mixing. With supernova hydrodynamics simulation data, we discuss the possibility of the SFP of both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos in core-collapse supernovae. The SFP of Dirac neutrinos occurs at a radius where the electron fraction is 1/3. The required magnetic field of the proto-neutron star for the SFP is a few $10^{14}$G at any explosion time. For the Majorana neutrinos, the required magnetic field fluctuates from $10^{13}$G to $10^{15}$G. Such a fluctuation of the magnetic field is more sensitive to the numerical scheme of the neutrino transport in the supernova simulation.

 Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are solid-state, single-photon sensitive, pixelated sensors whose usage for scintillation detection has rapidly increased over the past decade. It is known that the avalanche process within the device, which renders a single photon detectable, can also generate secondary photons which may be detected by a separate device. This effect, known as external crosstalk, could potentially degrade the science goals of future xenon dark matter experiments. In this article, we measure the effect of external crosstalk in a dual-phase, liquid xenon time projection chamber fully instrumented with SiPMs. We then consider the implications for a future xenon dark matter experiment utilizing SiPMs and discuss possible solutions.

2023-09-14, **Dark Matter Direct Detection in $t$-channel mediator models**, Giorgio Arcadi et.al., [2309.07896v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07896v1)

 We provide a complete reappraisal for the Direct Detection phenomenology of Dark Matter $t$-channel portal models. We provide a complete computation of the loop induced direct detection cross-section for both scalar and fermionic Dark Matter candidates. The results are compared with current and future bounds from direct detection experiments as well as with the requirement of the correct Dark Matter relic density.

2023-09-14, **Nuclear Recoil Identification in a Scientific Charge-Coupled Device**, K. J. McGuire et.al., [2309.07869v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07869v1)

 Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) are a leading technology in direct dark matter searches because of their eV-scale energy threshold and high spatial resolution. The sensitivity of future CCD experiments could be enhanced by distinguishing nuclear recoil signals from electronic recoil backgrounds in the CCD silicon target. We present a technique for event-by-event identification of nuclear recoils based on the spatial correlation between the primary ionization event and the lattice defect left behind by the recoiling atom, later identified as a localized excess of leakage current under thermal stimulation. By irradiating a CCD with an $^{241}$Am$^{9}$Be neutron source, we demonstrate $>93\%$ identification efficiency for nuclear recoils with energies $>150$ keV, where the ionization events were confirmed to be nuclear recoils from topology. The technique remains fully efficient down to 90 keV, decreasing to 50$\%$ at 8 keV, and reaching ($6\pm2$)$\%$ at 1.5--3.5 keV. Irradiation with a $^{24}$Na $\gamma$-ray source shows no evidence of defect generation by electronic recoils, with the fraction of electronic recoils with energies $<85$ keV that are spatially correlated with defects $<0.1$$\%$.

2023-09-14, **A Differentiable Model of the Evolution of Dark Matter Halo Concentration**, Dash Stevanovich et.al., [2309.07854v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07854v1)

 We introduce a new model of the evolution of the concentration of dark matter halos, c(t). For individual halos, our model approximates c(t) as a power law with a time-dependent index, such that at early times, concentration has a nearly constant value of c=3-4, and as cosmic time progresses, c(t) smoothly increases. Using large samples of halo merger trees taken from the Bolshoi-P and MDPL2 cosmological simulations, we demonstrate that our 3-parameter model can approximate the evolution of the concentration of individual halos with a typical accuracy of 0.1 dex for t>2 Gyr for all Bolshoi-P and MDPL2 halos of present-day mass greater than 10^11.5 Msun. We additionally present a new model of the evolution of the concentration of halo populations, which we show faithfully reproduces both average concentration growth, as well as the diversity of smooth trajectories of c(t), including capturing correlations with halo mass and halo assembly history. Our publicly available source code, Diffprof, can be used to generate Monte Carlo realizations of the concentration histories of cosmologically representative halo populations; Diffprof is differentiable due to its implementation in the JAX autodiff library, which facilitates the incorporation of our model into existing analytical halo model frameworks.

2023-09-14, **Interplay between Higgs inflation and dark matter models with dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry**, Sarif Khan et.al., [2309.07839v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07839v1)

 We investigate dark matter phenomenology and Higgs inflation in a dark $U(1)\_D$-extended model. The model features two dark matter candidates, a dark fermion and a dark vector boson. When the fermion DM $\psi$ is heavier than the vector DM $W\_D$, there is an ample parameter space where $\psi$ is dominant over $W\_D$. The model can then easily evade the stringent bounds from direct detection experiments, since $\psi$ has no direct coupling to the Standard Model particles. Furthermore, the model can accommodate inflation in three different ways, one along the Standard Model Higgs direction, one along the dark Higgs direction, and one along the combination of the two. Considering the running of the parameters and various observational constraints, we perform a detailed numerical analysis and identify allowed parameter spaces that explain both dark matter and Higgs inflation in a unified manner. We discuss in detail how the imposition of Higgs inflation severely constrains the dark matter parameter space. The existence of the dark Higgs field is found to play a crucial role both in dark matter phenomenology and in generalised Higgs inflation.

2023-09-14, **Additional Higgs Bosons near 95 and 650 GeV in the NMSSM**, Ulrich Ellwanger et.al., [2309.07838v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07838v1)

 Hints for an additional Higgs boson with a mass of about 95 GeV originate from LEP and searches in the diphoton channel by CMS and ATLAS. A search for resonant production of SM plus BSM Higgs bosons in the diphoton plus bb channel by CMS showed some excess for a 650 GeV resonance decaying into the SM Higgs plus a 95 GeV Higgs boson. We investigate whether these phenomena can be interpreted simultaneously within the NMSSM subject to the latest constraints on couplings of the SM Higgs boson, on extra Higgs bosons from the LHC, and on dark matter direct detection cross sections.

2023-09-14, **Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model, the coincidence problem and the gravitational wave speed**, H. Mohseni Sadjadi et.al., [2309.07816v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07816v1)

 We consider a dark energy model consisting of a scalar field simultaneously coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant and dark matter such that the observational gravitational wave speed constraint on the Gauss-Bonnet term is respected. In the early era, the Gauss-Bonnet term caused the scalar field to remain at a stable point. In this period, dark energy density was negligible. Next, due to the dark matter redshift and the conformal coupling, the initial $Z\_2$ symmetry was broken, and the activated field climbed up its potential and provided conditions for late-time acceleration. In this scenario, the Gauss-Bonnet term is not directly involved in the late-time evolution but alleviates the coincidence problem.

2023-09-14, **Mass transfer and boson cloud depletion in a binary black hole system**, Yao Guo et.al., [2309.07790v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07790v1)

 Ultralight boson is one of the potential candidates for dark matter. If exists, it can be generated by a rapidly rotating black hole via superradiance, extracting the energy and angular momentum of the black hole and forming a boson cloud. The boson cloud can be affected by the presence of a companion star, generating fruitful dynamical effects and producing characteristic gravitational wave signals. We study the dynamics of the boson cloud in a binary black hole system, in particular, we develop a framework to study the mass transfer between two black holes. It is found that bosons occupying the growing modes of the central black hole can jump to the decaying modes of the companion black hole, resulting in cloud depletion. This mechanism of cloud depletion is different from that induced by the resonant perturbation from the companion.

2023-09-14, **The Os$^{16+}$ and Ir$^{17+}$ ions as candidates for accurate optical clock sensitive to physics beyond standard model**, V. A. Dzuba et.al., [2309.07507v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07507v1)

 We perform detailed calculations of the electronic structure of the Os$^{16+}$ ion and demonstrate that it has several metastable states which can be used for very accurate optical clocks. The clocks are highly sensitive to manifestations of the physics beyond standard model, such as time variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha$, interaction with scalar and pseudoscalar (axion) dark matter fields, local Lorentz invariance and local position invariance violations, and interaction of atomic electrons with nucleus mediated by new boson. The latter can be studied by analysing King plot for isotope shifts and its possible non-linearities since Os has 5 stable isotopes with zero nuclear spin.   Similar calculations for the Ir$^{17+}$ ion spectra and some minor amendments to the interpretation of the experimental data demonstrate very good agreement between theory and experiment. This helps to validate the method of the calculations and demonstrate that both ions are excellent candidates for the search of new physics.

2023-09-14, **Preprocessing in small groups: Three simulated galaxies interacting prior to cluster infall**, Ewa L. Lokas et.al., [2309.07494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07494v1)

 The formation of galaxy clusters is a complicated process that probably involves the accretion of galaxies in groups, as observed in nearby clusters, such as Virgo and Fornax. The members of the groups undergo "preprocessing" prior to cluster infall, which affects their stellar populations and morphology. In this paper I present an extreme example of such an accretion event selected from the IllustrisTNG100 simulation. The group, composed of three full-sized disky galaxies and a number of smaller satellites, is accreted early, with the first pericenter around the cluster at redshift z=1.3. Before the infall, the three galaxies interact strongly in pairs within the group, which produces tidally induced bars in the two more massive ones. The interactions also lead to mass exchange and trigger some star formation activity resulting in temporary rejuvenation of their stellar populations. After infall, they all undergo seven pericenter passages around the cluster, experiencing strong mass loss in the dark matter and gas components, as well as reddening of the stellar populations. Their tidally induced bars are, however, preserved and even enhanced probably due to the loss of gas via ram-pressure stripping in the intracluster medium. The study demonstrates that group accretion can happen very early in cluster formation and proposes another scenario for the formation of tidally induced bars.

2023-09-14, **Constraints via EHT for black hole solutions with dark matter under the generalized uncertainty principle minimal length scale effect**, Ali ÃvgÃ¼n et.al., [2309.07442v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07442v1)

 We derived four novel classes of spherically symmetric but non-asymptotically flat black hole solutions surrounded with spherical dark matter distribution perceived under the minimal length scale effect via the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). Here, we considered the effect of this quantum correction, described by the parameter $\gamma$, on a toy model galaxy with dark matter and the three well-known dark matter distributions: the Cold Dark Matter (CDM), Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM), and the Universal Rotation Curve (URC). We aimed to find constraints to $\gamma$ by applying these solutions to the known supermassive black holes: Sgr. A* and M87*, in conjunction with the available Event Horizon telescope. We then examined the effect of $\gamma$ on the event horizon, photonsphere, and shadow radii, where we observed unique deviations from the Schwarzschild case. As for the shadow radii, we obtained bounds for the values of $\gamma$ on each black hole solution at $1\sigma$ confidence level. Our results revealed that under minimal length scale effect, black holes can give positive (larger shadow) and negative values (smaller shadow) of $\gamma$, which are supported indirectly by laboratory experiments and astrophysical or cosmological observations, respectively.

2023-09-13, **Why does the Milky Way have a bar?**, Sergey Khoperskov et.al., [2309.07321v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07321v1)

 There is no doubt that the Milky Way is a barred galaxy; however, factors that establish its prominent morphology remain largely elusive and poorly comprehended. In this work, we attempt to constrain the history of the MW by tracing the present-day parameters and evolution of a set of MW and M31 analogues from the TNG50 cosmological simulations. We find that the strength of bars at $z=0$ correlates well not only with the total mass build-up of galaxies but, more crucially, with the time of rapid onset of stellar discs. Discs of strongly barred galaxies form early ($ z \gtrsim 2-3$), compared to weakly barred and non-barred galaxies ($z \approx 1-1.5$). Although we are cautious to draw ultimate conclusions about the governing factor of discs formation due to the complexity and correlations between different physical phenomena~(dark matter mass growth, gas accretion rate, mergers and others) affecting galaxy growth, the observed morphological diversity of galaxies can be tentatively explained by a substantial variation in the gas angular momentum around proto-galaxies already at $z\approx 3-5$; in such a way, early discs with the strongest bars at $z=0$ formed from gas with the largest angular momentum.   By comparing the formation time scales of discs of barred galaxies in the TNG50 sample, we suggest that the MW has a strong bar ($0.35<A\_2<0.6$) and that its stellar disc started to dominate over the spheroidal component already at $z \approx 2$, with a mass of $\approx 1 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{10} M\_\odot$. We, therefore, conclude that the presence of a strong bar in the MW is a natural manifestation of the early formation of the stellar disc, which made possible bursty but highly efficient star formation at high redshift.

2023-09-13, **Can the angular scale of cosmic homogeneity be used as a cosmological test?**, Xiaoyun Shao et.al., [2309.07263v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07263v1)

 In standard cosmology, the cosmic homogeneity scale is the transition scale above which the patterns arising from non-uniformities -- such as groups and clusters of galaxies, voids, and filaments -- become indistinguishable from a random distribution of sources. Recently, different groups have investigated the feasibility of using such a scale as a cosmological test and arrived at different conclusions. In this paper, we complement and extend these studies by exploring the evolution of the spatial (${\cal{R}}\_H$) and angular ($\theta\_H$) homogeneity scales with redshift, assuming a spatially flat, $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter %($\Lambda$CDM) universe and linear cosmological perturbation theory. We confirm previous results concerning the non-monotonicity of ${\cal{R}}\_H$ with the matter density parameter $\Omega\_{m0}$ but also show that it exhibits a monotonical behavior with the Hubble constant $H\_0$ within a large redshift interval. More importantly, we find that, for $z \gtrsim 0.6$, the angular homogeneity scale not only presents a monotonical behavior with $\Omega\_{m0}$ and $H\_0$ but is quite sensitive to $H\_0$, especially at higher redshifts. These results, therefore, raise the possibility of using $\theta\_H$ as a new, model-independent way to constrain cosmological parameters.

2023-09-13, **Taking aim at the wino-higgsino plane with the LHC**, Linda M. Carpenter et.al., [2309.07213v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07213v1)

 In this work we explore multiple search strategies for higgsinos and mixed higgsino-wino states in the MSSM and project the results onto the $(\mu,M\_2)$ plane. Assuming associated production of higgsino-like pairs with a $W/Z$ boson, we develop a search in a channel characterized by a hadronically tagged vector boson accompanied by missing energy. We use as our template an ATLAS search for dark matter produced in association with a hadronically decaying vector boson, but upgrade the search by implementing a joint likelihood analysis, binning the missing transverse energy distribution, which greatly improves the search sensitivity. For higgsino-like states (more than 96% admixture) we find sensitivity to masses up to 550 GeV. For well-mixed higgsino-wino states (70-30% higgsino) we still find sensitivities above 300 GeV. Using this newly proposed search, we draw a phenomenological map of the wino-higgsino parameter space, recasting several complementary searches for disappearing tracks, soft leptons, trileptons, and hadronic diboson events in order to predict LHC coverage of the $(\mu,M\_2)$ mass plane at integrated luminosities of up to $3\,\text{ab}^{-1}$. Altogether, the full run of the HL-LHC can exclude much of the "natural" ($\mu,M\_2 <$ 500 GeV) wino-higgsino parameter space.

2023-09-13, **A Tilted Dark Halo Origin of the Galactic Disk Warp and Flare**, Jiwon Jesse Han et.al., [2309.07209v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07209v1)

 The outer disk of the Milky Way Galaxy is warped and flared. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena, but none have quantitatively reproduced both features. Recent work has demonstrated that the Galactic stellar halo is tilted with respect to the disk plane, suggesting that at least some component of the dark matter halo may also be tilted. Here we show that a dark halo tilted in the same direction as the stellar halo can induce a warp and flare in the Galactic disk at the same amplitude and orientation as the data. In our model the warp is visible in both the gas and stars of all ages, which is consistent with the breadth of observational tracers of the warp. These results, in combination with data in the stellar halo, provide compelling evidence that our Galaxy is embedded in a tilted dark matter halo. This misalignment of the dark halo and the disk holds clue to the formation history of the Galaxy, and represents the next step in the dynamical modeling of the Galactic potential.

2023-09-13, **A full reconstruction of two galaxy clusters intra-cluster medium with strong gravitational lensing**, Joseph F. V. Allingham et.al., [2309.07076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07076v1)

 Whilst X-rays and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations allow to study the properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, their gravitational potential may be constrained using strong gravitational lensing. Although being physically related, these two components are often described with different physical models. Here, we present a unified technique to derive the ICM properties from strong lensing for clusters in hydrostatic equilibrium. In order to derive this model, we present a new universal and self-similar polytropic temperature profile, which we fit using the X-COP sample of clusters. We subsequently derive an analytical model for the electron density, which we apply to strong lensing clusters MACS J0242.5-2132 and MACS J0949.8+1708. We confront the inferred ICM reconstructions to XMM-Newton and ACT observations. We contrast our analytical electron density reconstructions with the best canonical $\beta$-model. The ICM reconstructions obtained prove to be compatible with observations. However they appear to be very sensitive to various dark matter halo parameters constrained through strong lensing (such as the core radius), and to the halo scale radius (fixed in the lensing optimisations). With respect to the important baryonic effects, we make the sensitivity on the scale radius of the reconstruction an asset, and use the inferred potential to constrain the dark matter density profile using ICM observations. The technique here developed should allow to take a new, and more holistic path to constrain the content of galaxy clusters.

 The axion is a hypothetical elementary particle that could solve the long-standing strong CP problem in particle physics and the dark matter mystery in the cosmos. Due to the stimulation of the ambient photons, the axion dark matter decay into photons is significantly enhanced so that its echo signal could be detected by terrestrial telescopes. As a pathfinder, we study the expected sensitivity of searching for the axion dark matter in the mass range between $0.41$ and $1.6\mu\text{eV}$ with the 21 CentiMeter Array (21CMA). We aim to cover the whole 21CMA frequency range in two years by using a 1MW emitter. We find that the resulting sensitivity on the axion-photon coupling could surpass other existing limits by about one order of magnitude.

 We present extensive ultraviolet (UV) and optical photometric and optical spectroscopic follow-up of supernova (SN)~2021gno by the "Precision Observations of Infant Supernova Explosions" (POISE) project, starting less than two days after the explosion. Given its intermediate luminosity, fast photometric evolution, and quick transition to the nebular phase with spectra dominated by [Ca~II] lines, SN~2021gno belongs to the small family of Calcium-rich transients. Moreover, it shows double-peaked light curves, a phenomenon shared with only four other Calcium-rich events. The projected distance from the center of the host galaxy is not as large as other objects in this family. The initial optical light-curve peaks coincide with a very quick decline of the UV flux, indicating a fast initial cooling phase. Through hydrodynamical modelling of the bolometric light curve and line velocity evolution, we found that the observations are compatible with the explosion of a highly-stripped massive star with an ejecta mass of $0.8\,M\_\odot$ and a $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.024~M\_{\odot}$. The initial cooling phase (first light curve peak) is explained by the presence of an extended circumstellar material comprising $\sim$$10^{-2}\,M\_{\odot}$ with an extension of $1100\,R\_{\odot}$. We discuss if hydrogen features are present in both maximum-light and nebular spectra, and its implications in terms of the proposed progenitor scenarios for Calcium-rich transients.

2023-09-14, **Late-time phenomenology required to solve the $H_0$ tension in view of the cosmic ladders and the anisotropic and angular BAO data sets**, AdriÃ  GÃ³mez-Valent et.al., [2309.07795v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07795v1)

 The $\sim 5\sigma$ mismatch between the value of the Hubble parameter measured by SH0ES and the one inferred from the inverse distance ladder (IDL) constitutes the biggest tension afflicting the standard model of cosmology, which could be pointing to the need of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. In this paper we study the background history required to solve the $H\_0$ tension if we consider standard prerecombination physics, paying special attention to the role played by the data on baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) employed to build the IDL. We show that the anisotropic BAO data favor an ultra-late-time (phantom-like) enhancement of $H(z)$ at $z\lesssim 0.2$ to solve the tension, accompanied by a transition in the absolute magnitude of supernovae of Type Ia $M(z)$ in the same redshift range. The effective dark energy (DE) density must be smaller than in the standard model at higher redshifts. Instead, when angular BAO data (claimed to be less subject to model dependencies) is employed in the analysis, we find that the increase of $H(z)$ starts at much higher redshifts, typically in the range $z\sim 0.6-0.9$. In this case, $M(z)$ could experience also a transition (although much smoother) and the effective DE density becomes negative at $z\gtrsim 2$. Both scenarios require a violation of the weak energy condition (WEC), but leave an imprint on completely different redshift ranges and might also have a different impact on the perturbed observables. They allow for the effective crossing of the phantom divide. Finally, we employ two alternative methods to show that current data from cosmic chronometers do not exclude the violation of the WEC, but do not add any strong evidence in its favor neither. Our work puts the accent on the utmost importance of the choice of the BAO data set in the study of the possible solutions to the $H\_0$ tension.

2023-09-14, **Bridging between type IIb and Ib supernovae: SN IIb 2022crv with a very thin Hydrogen envelope**, Anjasha Gangopadhyay et.al., [2309.07463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07463v1)

 We present optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of supernova (SN) SN~IIb 2022crv. We show that it retained a very thin H envelope and transitioned from a SN~IIb to a SN~Ib; prominent H$\alpha$ seen in the pre-maximum phase diminishes toward the post-maximum phase, while He {\sc i} lines show increasing strength. \texttt{SYNAPPS} modeling of the early spectra of SN~2022crv suggests that the absorption feature at 6200\,\AA\ is explained by a substantial contribution of H$\alpha$ together with Si {\sc ii}, as is also supported by the velocity evolution of H$\alpha$. The light-curve evolution is consistent with the canonical stripped-envelope supernova subclass but among the slowest. The light curve lacks the initial cooling phase and shows a bright main peak (peak M$\_{V}$=$-$17.82$\pm$0.17 mag), mostly driven by radioactive decay of $\rm^{56}$Ni. The light-curve analysis suggests a thin outer H envelope ($M\_{\rm env} \sim$0.05 M$\_{\odot}$) and a compact progenitor (R$\_{\rm env}$ $\sim$3 R$\_{\odot}$). An interaction-powered synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) model can reproduce the radio light curves with a mean shock velocity of 0.1c. The mass-loss rate is estimated to be in the range of (1.9$-$2.8) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for an assumed wind velocity of 1000 km s$^{-1}$, which is on the high end in comparison with other compact SNe~IIb/Ib. SN~2022crv fills a previously unoccupied parameter space of a very compact progenitor, representing a beautiful continuity between the compact and extended progenitor scenario of SNe~IIb/Ib.

2023-09-13, **The JWST Discovery of the Triply-imaged Type Ia "Supernova H0pe" and Observations of the Galaxy Cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0**, Brenda L. Frye et.al., [2309.07326v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07326v1)

 A Type Ia supernova (SN) at $z=1.78$ was discovered in James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera imaging of the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165; $z = 0.35$). The SN is situated 1.5-2kpc from its host galaxy Arc 2 and appears in three different locations as a result of gravitational lensing by G165. These data can yield a value for Hubble's constant using time delays from this multiply-imaged SN Ia that we call "SN H0pe." Over the entire field we identified 21 image multiplicities, confirmed five of them using Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRspec), and constructed a new lens model that gives a total mass within 600kpc of ($2.6 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{14}$ M$\_{\odot}$. The photometry uncovered a galaxy overdensity at Arc 2's redshift. NIRSpec confirmed six member galaxies, four of which surround Arc 2 with relative velocity $\lesssim$900 km s$^{-1}$ and projected physical extent $\lesssim$33 kpc. Arc 2 dominates the stellar mass ($(5.0 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{11}$ M$\_{\odot}$), which is a factor of ten higher than other members of this compact galaxy group. These other group members have specific star formation rates (sSFR) of 2-260Gyr$^{-1}$ derived from the H$\alpha$-line flux corrected for stellar absorption, dust extinction, and slit losses. Another group centered on the dusty star forming galaxy Arc 1 is at $z=2.24$. The total SFR for the Arc 1 group ($gtrsim$ M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) translates to a supernova rate of $\sim$1 SNe yr$^{-1}$, suggesting that regular monitoring of this cluster may yield additional SNe.

2023-09-13, **Dimming the Lights: 2D Simulations of Deflagrations of Hybrid C/O/Ne White Dwarfs using FLASH**, Catherine Feldman et.al., [2309.07283v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07283v1)

 The dimmest and most numerous outlier of the Type Ia supernova population, Type Iax events, is increasingly being found in the results of observational campaigns. There is currently no single accepted model to describe these events. This 2D study explores the viability of modeling Type Iax events as a hybrid C/O/Ne white dwarf progenitor undergoing a deflagration using the multi-physics software FLASH. This hybrid was created using the stellar evolution code MESA, and its C-depleted core and mixed structure have demonstrated lower yields than traditional C/O progenitors in previous deflagration-to-detonation studies. To generate a sample, 30 "realizations" of this simulation were performed, the only difference being the shape of the initial matchhead used to start the deflagration. As consistent with earlier work, these realizations produce the familiar hot dense bound remnant surrounded by sparse ejecta. Our results indicate the majority of the star remains unburned (~70%) and bound (>90%). Our realizations produce total ejecta yields on the order of 10$^{-2}$ - 10$^{-1}$ solar masses, ejected $^{56}$Ni yields on the order of 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-2}$ solar masses, and ejecta kinetic energies on the order of 10$^{48}$ - 10$^{49}$ ergs. Compared to yields inferred from recent observations of the dimmest Type Iax events - SN 2007qd, SN 2008ha, SN 2010ae, SN 2019gsc, SN 2019muj, SN 2020kyg, and SN 2021fcg - our simulation produces comparable $^{56}$Ni yields, but too-small total yields and kinetic energies. Reignition of the remnant is also seen in some realizations.

2023-09-13, **Keck Infrared Transient Survey I: Survey Description and Data Release 1**, S. Tinyanont et.al., [2309.07102v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07102v1)

 We present the Keck Infrared Transient Survey (KITS), a NASA Key Strategic Mission Support program to obtain near-infrared (NIR) spectra of astrophysical transients of all types, and its first data release, consisting of 105 NIR spectra of 50 transients. Such a data set is essential as we enter a new era of IR astronomy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman). NIR spectral templates will be essential to search JWST images for stellar explosions of the first stars and to plan an effective Roma} SN Ia cosmology survey, both key science objectives for mission success. Between 2022 February and 2023 July, we systematically obtained 274 NIR spectra of 146 astronomical transients, representing a significant increase in the number of available NIR spectra in the literature. The first data release includes data from the 2022A semester. We systematically observed three samples: a flux-limited sample that includes all transients $<$17 mag in a red optical band (usually ZTF r or ATLAS o bands); a volume-limited sample including all transients within redshift $z < 0.01$ ($D \approx 50$ Mpc); and an SN Ia sample targeting objects at phases and light-curve parameters that had scant existing NIR data in the literature. The flux-limited sample is 39% complete (60% excluding SNe Ia), while the volume-limited sample is 54% complete and is 79% complete to $z = 0.005$. All completeness numbers will rise with the inclusion of data from other telescopes in future data releases. Transient classes observed include common Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae, tidal disruption events (TDEs), luminous red novae, and the newly categorized hydrogen-free/helium-poor interacting Type Icn supernovae. We describe our observing procedures and data reduction using Pypeit, which requires minimal human interaction to ensure reproducibility.

2023-09-13, **When and how does ram pressure stripping in low-mass satellite galaxies enhance star formation**, Jingyao Zhu et.al., [2309.07037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07037v1)

 We investigate how a satellite's star formation rate (SFR) and surviving gas respond to ram pressure stripping in various environments. Using a suite of high-resolution "wind-tunnel" simulations with radiative cooling, star formation, and supernovae feedback, we model the first infall orbit of a low-mass disk galaxy ($M\_{*} = 10^{9.7} M\_{\odot}$) in different host halos, ranging from Milky Way-like to cluster hosts. When the ram pressure is moderate, we find that the stripping satellite shows an enhanced SFR relative to the isolated control case, despite gas loss due to stripping. The SFR enhancement is caused, not directly by compression, but by ram pressure-driven mass flows, which can increase the dense gas fraction in the central disk regions. The spatially-resolved star formation main sequence and Kennicutt-Schmidt relations in our simulations are consistent with recent findings of the VERTICO and GASP surveys. Our results predict the environmental signals of RPS in future multiwavelength, high-angular resolution observations: the star formation and gas surface densities will be centralized, and symmetrically enhanced within the stripping radius.

2023-09-13, **Discovery of a molecular cloud possibly associated with the youngest Galactic SNR G1.9+0.3**, Rei Enokiya et.al., [2309.06855v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06855v1)

 The youngest known Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G1.9+0.3 has high-velocity supernova shock beyond 10000 km s-1, and it is considered to be one of the major candidates of a PeVatron. Despite these outstanding properties, the surrounding interstellar matter of this object is poorly understood. We investigated the interstellar gas toward G1.9+0.3 using the 12CO(J=3-2) data with the angular resolution of 15" obtained by the CHIMPS2 survey by the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and discovered three individual clouds at -1, 7, and 45 km s-1. From its morphological and velocity structures, the -1 km s-1 cloud, having the largest velocity width >20 km s-1 and located at the distance of the Galactic Center, is possibly associated with the SNR. The associated cloud shows a cavity structure both in space and velocity and coincides well with the SNR. We found that the associated cloud has higher column densities toward three bright, radio synchrotron-emitted rims where the radial expansion velocity of the supernova shock is decelerated, and the cloud is faint in the other parts of the SNR. This is the first direct evidence indicating that the highly anisotropic expansion of G1.9+0.3 observed by previous studies results from the deceleration by the interaction between the supernova shock and surrounding dense interstellar medium.
