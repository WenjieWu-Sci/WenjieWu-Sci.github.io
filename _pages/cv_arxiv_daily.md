2023-07-17, **Gauging the cosmic ray muon puzzle with the Forward Physics Facility**, Sergio J. Sciutto et.al., [2307.08634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08634v1)

 We investigate the observed muon deficit in air shower simulations when compared to ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) data. Gleaned from the observed enhancement of strangeness production in ALICE data, the associated $\pi \leftrightarrow K$ swap is taken as a cornerstone to resolve the muon puzzle via its corresponding impact on the shower evolution. We develop a phenomenological model in terms of the $\pi \leftrightarrow K$ swapping probability $F\_s$. We provide a parametrization of $F\_s (E^{\rm (proj)}, \eta)$ that can accommodate the UHECR data, where $E^{\rm (proj)}$ is the projectile energy and $\eta$ the pseudorapidity. We also explore a future game plan for model improvement using the colossal amount of data to be collected by LHC neutrino detectors at the Forward Physics Facility (FPF). We calculate the corresponding sensitivity to $F\_s$ and show that the FPF experiments will be able to probe the model phase space.

2023-07-17, **Pressure safety approach for PIP-II cryogenic distribution system and cryomodules**, William Soyars et.al., [2307.08608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08608v1)

 The Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) is a superconducting linear accelerator being built at Fermilab that will provide 800 MeV proton beam for neutrino production. The linac consists of a total of twenty-three (23) cryomodules of five (5) different types. Cooling is required at 2K, 5K and 40K. The Cryogenic Distribution System (CDS) consists of a Distribution Valve Box, ~285 m of cryogenic transfer line, modular Bayonet Cans to interface with cryomodules, and a Turnaround Can. The cryogenic system must provide protection from over-pressure by sizing pressure relief devices for all volumes and process line circuits. The cryomodule cavity circuits have dual pressure ratings, 4.1 bara when cold and 2.05 bara when warm (T>80K). Worst case relieving cases will be identified. The methods for determining heat flux will be presented. For the relieving occurring in the linac tunnel, flow must vent to outside to avoid an oxygen deficiency hazard. Also, we will present vacuum vessel relief sizing to protect the cryogenic distribution system vacuum shells from over pressure during an internal line rupture. The project is funded by US DOE Offices of Science, High Energy Physics.

2023-07-17, **Neutrino decoupling and the transition to cold dark matter**, Roman Schnabel et.al., [2307.08427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08427v1)

 About 40 years ago, the neutrino was ruled out as the dark matter particle based on several arguments. Here I use the well-established concept of quantum uncertainties of position and momentum to describe the decoupling of neutrinos from the primordial plasma, which took place about half a second after the Big Bang. In this way I show that the main arguments against the neutrino are either wrong or have loopholes, and conclude that the neutrino urgently needs to be reconsidered, not as a 'hot', but as the 'cold' dark matter particle.

2023-07-17, **Standard Model Higgs inflation supplemented by minimal dark matter**, Shinsuke Kawai et.al., [2307.08375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08375v1)

 Renormalisation group analysis with the present measurements of the top quark mass $m\_t = 172.69\pm 0.30$ GeV indicates that the Standard Model (SM) Higgs potential becomes unstable at energy scales $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. This may be interpreted as hinting at new particles at high energy. The minimal extension of the SM that can avoid this instability while leaving the SM Higgs as the sole scalar particle of the theory is obtained by adding suitable fermions to the SM. These fermions are good dark matter candidates and the model is known as the minimal dark matter model. We revisit the inflationary scenario based on the minimal dark matter model, taking into account updated parameter constraints and recent understanding of reheating dynamics. We explore the model with different values of the right-handed neutrino mass and find that the cosmological prediction is insensitive to such details. We obtained a spectral index of the cosmic microwave background $n\_s=9.672$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.0031$ as a robust prediction of this scenario.

2023-07-17, **Fast evaluation of heavy-quark contributions to DIS in APFEL++**, P. Risse et.al., [2307.08269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08269v1)

 Mass-dependent quark contributions are of great importance to DIS processes. The simplified-ACOT-scheme includes these effects over a wide range of momentum transfers up to next-to-leading order in QCD. In recent years an improvement in the case of neutral current DIS has been achieved by using zero-mass contributions up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) with massive phase-space constraints. In this work, we extend this approach to the case of charged current DIS and provide an implementation in the open-source code APFEL++. The increased precision will be valuable for ongoing and future neutrino programs, the Electron-Ion-Collider and the studies of partonic substructure of hadrons and nuclei. A highly efficient implementation using gridding techniques extends the applicability of the code to the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs).

2023-07-16, **Hadronic nature of high-energy emission from the Galactic Ridge**, A. Neronov et.al., [2307.07978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07978v1)

 We show that the IceCube observation of the Galactic neutrino flux component confirms the hint of detection of neutrinos from the Galactic Ridge (the inner part of the Milky Way disk within the Galactic longitude \|l\|<30 degrees), previously reported by the ANTARES collaboration. This confirmation indicates that the bulk of the high-energy flux from the Galactic Ridge in multi-TeV band is produced by interactions of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei, rather than electrons. We show that both ANTARES and IceCube measurements agree with the Fermi-LAT telescope measurements of the gamma-ray emission from the Ridge. The multi-messenger (neutrino plus gamma-ray) spectrum of the Ridge over a broad energy range from 10 GeV to 10 TeV is consistent with a model of pion decay emission produced by a power-law distribution of protons with a slope Gamma~2.5, harder than that of the locally observed cosmic ray spectrum. This provides for the first time an unambiguous multi-messenger demonstration of the variability of the spectrum of cosmic rays across the Galactic disk.

2023-07-16, **The global $B-L$ symmetry in the flavor-unified ${\rm SU}(N)$ theories**, Ning Chen et.al., [2307.07921v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07921v1)

 We study the origin of the global $B-L$ symmetry in a class of flavor-unified theories with gauge groups of ${\rm SU}(N\geq 6)$. In particular, we focus on the ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory which can minimally embed three-generational SM fermions non-trivially. A reformulation of the third law for the flavor sector proposed by Georgi is useful to manifest the underlying global symmetries. The 't Hooft anomaly matching and the generalized neutrality conditions for Higgs fields play the key roles in defining the $B-L$ symmetry. Based on the global $B-L$ symmetry, we count the Higgs fields that can develop the VEVs and the massless sterile neutrinos in the ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory. We also prove that a global $B-L$ symmetry can always be defined in any ${\rm SU}(N\geq 6)$ theory when it is spontaneously broken to the SM gauge symmetry.

2023-07-17, **The linear response theory approach to the sub-GeV dark matter in the Sun**, Zheng-Liang Liang et.al., [2307.08546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08546v1)

 In recent years, the importance of the electronic in-medium effect in the sub-GeV dark matter (DM) direct detection has been recognized and a coherent formulation of the DM-electron scattering based the linear response theory has been well established in the literature. In this paper, we apply the formulation to the scattering between DM particles and solar medium, and it is found that the dynamic structure factor inherently incorporate the particle-particle scattering and in-medium effect. Using this tool and taking a benchmark model as an example, we demonstrate how the in-medium effect affect the scattering of DM particles in the Sun, in both the heavy and light mediator limit. Formulae derived in this work lay the foundation for accurately calculating the spectra of solar-accelerated DM particles, which is of particular importance for the detection of DM particles via plasmon in semiconductor targets.

2023-07-17, **The future of cosmology? A case for CMB spectral distortions**, Matteo Lucca et.al., [2307.08513v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08513v1)

 This thesis treats the topic of CMB Spectral Distortions (SDs), which represent any deviation from a pure black body shape of the CMB energy spectrum. As such, they can be used to probe the inflationary, expansion and thermal evolution of the universe both within $\Lambda$CDM and beyond it. The currently missing observation of this rich probe of the universe makes of it an ideal target for future observational campaigns. In fact, while the $\Lambda$CDM signal guarantees a discovery, the sensitivity to a wide variety of new physics opens the door to an enormous uncharted territory. In light of these considerations, the thesis opens by reviewing the topic of CMB SDs in a pedagogical and illustrative fashion, aimed at waking the interest of the broader community. This introductory premise sets the stage for the first main contribution of the thesis to the field of SDs: their implementation in the Boltzmann solver CLASS and the parameter inference code MontePython. The CLASS+MontePython pipeline is publicly available, fast, it includes all sources of SDs within $\Lambda$CDM and many others beyond that, and allows to consistently account for any observational setup. By means of these numerical tools, the second main contribution of the thesis consists in showcasing the versatility and competitiveness of SDs for several cosmological models as well as for a number of different mission designs. Among others, the results cover features in the primordial power spectrum, primordial gravitational waves, non-standard dark matter properties, primordial black holes, primordial magnetic fields and Hubble tension. Finally, the manuscript is disseminated with (20) follow-up ideas that naturally extend the work carried out so far, highlighting how rich of unexplored possibilities the field of CMB SDs still is. The hope is that these suggestions will become a propeller for further interesting developments.

2023-07-17, **$k-$Dependent Dark Matter**, Parisa Arabameri et.al., [2307.08495v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08495v1)

 With the emersion of precise cosmology and the emergence of cosmic tensions, we are faced with the question of whether the simple model of cold dark matter needs to be extended and whether doing so can alleviate the tensions and improve our understanding of the properties of dark matter. In this study, we investigate one of the generalized models of dark matter so that the behavior of this dark matter changes according to the scale of $k$. In large scales (small $k$'s), the dark matter is cold, while it becomes warm for small scales (large $k$'s). This behavior is modeled phenomenologically for two different scenarios. We show that the $S\_8$ tension can be alleviated, but the $H\_0$ tension becomes milder while not too much.

2023-07-16, **NANOGrav Signal and PBH from the Modified Higgs Inflation**, Kingman Cheung et.al., [2307.08046v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08046v1)

 This study investigates the classical Higgs inflation model with a modified Higgs potential featuring a dip. We examine the implications of this modification on the generation of curvature perturbations, stochastic gravitational wave production, and the potential formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Unlike the classical model, the modified potential allows for enhanced power spectra and the existence of PBHs within a wide mass range $1.5\times10^{20}$ g -- $9.72\times10^{32}$ g. We identify parameter space regions that align with inflationary constraints and have the potential to contribute significantly to the observed dark matter content. Additionally, the study explores the consistency of the obtained parameter space with cosmological constraints and discusses the implications for explaining the observed excess in gravitational wave signals, particularly in the NANOGrav experiment. Overall, this investigation highlights the relevance of the modified Higgs potential in the classical Higgs inflation model, shedding light on the formation of PBHs, the nature of dark matter, and the connection to gravitational wave observations.

2023-07-17, **Helium as a signature of the double detonation in Type Ia supernovae**, Christine E. Collins et.al., [2307.08660v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08660v1)

 The double detonation is a widely discussed mechanism to explain Type Ia supernovae from explosions of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. In this scenario, a helium detonation is ignited in a surface helium shell on a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, which leads to a secondary carbon detonation. Explosion simulations predict high abundances of unburnt helium in the ejecta, however, radiative transfer simulations have not been able to fully address whether helium spectral features would form. This is because helium can not be sufficiently excited to form spectral features by thermal processes, but can be excited by collisions with non-thermal electrons, which most studies have neglected. We carry out a full non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer simulation for an instance of a double detonation explosion model, and include a non-thermal treatment of fast electrons. We find a clear He I {\lambda} 10830 feature which is strongest in the first few days after explosion and becomes weaker with time. Initially this feature is blended with the Mg II {\lambda} 10927 feature but over time separates to form a secondary feature to the blue wing of the Mg II {\lambda} 10927 feature. We compare our simulation to observations of iPTF13ebh, which showed a similar feature to the blue wing of the Mg II {\lambda} 10927 feature, previously identified as C I. Our simulation shows a good match to the evolution of this feature and we identify it as high velocity He I {\lambda} 10830. This suggests that He I {\lambda} 10830 could be a signature of the double detonation scenario.

2023-07-17, **XMM-Newton observations of the TeV-discovered supernova remnant HESS J1534-571**, N. T. Nguyen-Dang et.al., [2307.08656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08656v1)

 We report the results obtained from XMM-Newton observations of the TeV-detected supernova remnant (SNR) HESS J1534-571. We focus on the nature of the cosmic-ray particle content in the SNR, which is revealed by its $\gamma$-ray emission. No signatures of X-ray synchrotron emission were detected from the SNR. This is consistent with earlier results obtained with Suzaku from other regions of the object. A joint modeling of the XMM-Newton and Suzaku spectra yields an upper limit for the total X-ray flux from the SNR area of $\sim$ 5.62$ \times 10^{-13} \ \mathrm{erg\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ (95% c.l.) in the energy band of 2-10 keV, for an assumed photon index of 2.0. On the other hand, we do find evidence in the XMM-Newton data for a line-like emission feature at 6.4 keV from localized regions, again confirming earlier Suzaku measurements. We discuss the findings in the context of the origin of the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. Although neither hadronic nor leptonic scenarios can be fully ruled out, the observed line emission can be interpreted as the result of interactions between lower energy ($\sim$ MeV) cosmic-ray protons with high gas density regions in and around HESS J1534-571, and thus potentially be associated with particles accelerated in the SNR.

2023-07-17, **Using spectral modeling to break light-curve degeneracies of type II supernovae interacting with circumstellar material**, Luc Dessart et.al., [2307.08584v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08584v1)

 A large fraction of red-supergiant stars seem to be enshrouded by circumstellar material (CSM) at the time of explosion. Relative to explosions in a vacuum, this CSM causes both a luminosity boost at early times as well as the presence of symmetric emission lines with a narrow core and electron-scattering wings typical of type IIn supernovae (SNe). For this study, we performed radiation-hydrodynamics and radiative transfer calculations for a variety of CSM configurations (i.e., compact, extended, and detached) and documented the resulting ejecta and radiation properties. We find that models with a dense, compact, and massive CSM of ~0.5Msun can match the early luminosity boost of type II-P SNe but fail to produce type IIn-like spectral signatures (aka ``flash features''). These only arise if the photon mean free path in the CSM is large enough (i.e, if the density is low enough) to allow for a radiative precursor through a long-lived (i.e., a day to a week), radially extended unshocked optically thick CSM. The greater radiative losses and kinetic-energy extraction in this case boost the luminosity even for modest CSM masses -- this boost is delayed for a detached CSM. The inadequate assumption of high CSM density, in which the shock travels quasi adiabatically, overestimates the CSM mass and associated mass-loss rate. Our simulations also indicate that type IIn-like spectral signatures last as long as there is optically-thick unshocked CSM. Constraining the CSM structure therefore requires a combination of light curves and spectra, rather than photometry alone. We emphasize that for a given total energy, the radiation excess fostered by the presence of CSM comes at the expense of kinetic energy, as evidenced by the disappearance of the fastest ejecta material and the accumulation of mass in a dense shell. Both effects can be constrained from spectra well after the interaction phase.

2023-07-17, **A Measurement of Hubble Constant Using Cosmographic Approach from Fast Radio Bursts and SNe Ia**, Jiaze Gao et.al., [2307.08285v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08285v1)

 The Hubble constant ${H}\_0$ is a crucial parameter in cosmology. However, different cosmic observations have resulted in varying posterior results for ${H}\_0$, leading to what is known as the ${H}\_0$ tension. In order to address this issue, it is beneficial to use other dataset to constrain ${H}\_0$. In this paper, via the cosmographic approach based on the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric to the dispersion measure of the intergalactic medium ${\rm{DM}}\_{\rm{IGM}}(z)$ of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), we obtain the Taylor expansion of $\langle{\rm{DM}}\_{\rm{IGM}}(z)\rangle$ in terms redshift $z$. The result for Hubble constant $H\_0=65.5^{+6.4}\_{-5.4}$ ${\rm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ $(68$$\%$ ${\rm{C.L.}}) $, cosmological deceleration parameter $q\_0=-0.50\pm 0.20 $ and the jerk parameter $j\_0=-0.1^{+2.0}\_{-2.5}$ using uncalibrated Supernova Ia (SNe Ia) Pantheon dataset combined with 18 localized FRBs are obtained. To demonstrate the impact of parameter degeneracies on our analysis methods, we compare the results using three different forms of $f\_{\rm{IGM}}(z)$ and two different prior distributions for $\Omega\_{\rm{b,0}}$. Then we find that the uncertainty in $H\_0$ is not significantly affected by the prior range of $f\_{\rm{IGM}}(z)$ and $\Omega\_{\rm{b,0}}$, but the mean value is influenced by the priors for $f\_{\rm{IGM}}(z)$ and $\Omega\_{\rm{b,0}}$ due to parameter degeneracies with $H\_0$. Employing $f\_{\rm{IGM}}(z)$ that evolves with redshift, we obtain the constraints for $H\_0=69.0^{+6.7}\_{-5.7}$ ${\rm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$. Furthermore, the mock analyses give a posterior estimation of $H\_0$ with an accuracy of 4.6\% and higher precision for $q\_0$ and $j\_0$ in the near future.

2023-07-16, **Growth of Seed Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei**, Rainer Spurzem et.al., [2307.08068v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08068v1)

 The evolution of dense star clusters is followed by direct high-accuracy N-body simulation. The problem is to first order a gravitational N-body problem, but stars evolve due to astrophysics and the more massive ones form black holes or neutron stars as compact remnants at the end of their life. After including updates of stellar evolution of massive stars and for the relativistic treatment of black hole binaries we find the growth of intermediate mass black holes and we show that in star clusters binary black hole mergers in the so-called pair creation supernova (PSN) gap occur easily. Such black hole mergers have been recently observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, a network of ground based gravitational wave detectors.

2023-07-16, **Detection Prospects of Fast-merging Gravitational Wave Sources in M31**, Jian-Guo He et.al., [2307.07955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07955v1)

 It is widely accepted that quite a number of double compact objects (DCOs) in the Milky Way can be identified by future space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, while systematic investigations on the detection of the GW sources in nearby galaxies are still lacking. In this paper, we present calculations of potential populations of GW sources for all types of DCOs in the Local Group galaxy M31. For M31, we use an age-dependent model for the evolution of the metallicity and the star-formation rate. By varying assumptions of common-envelope ejection efficiencies and supernova-explosion mechanisms during binary evolution, we make predictions on the properties of DCOs that can be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Our calculations indicate that a few (a dozen) DCOs are likely to be observed by LISA during its 4 (10) yr mission. We expect that the sources with black-hole components are more likely to be firstly identified during a 4-yr mission since these binaries have relatively large chirp masses, while the systems with white-dwarf components dominate the overall population of detectable GW sources during a 10-yr mission. LISA can only detect very tight fast-merging systems in M31, corresponding to the peak of orbital period distribution from $\sim 2$ min for double white dwarfs to $\sim 20$~min for double black holes.
