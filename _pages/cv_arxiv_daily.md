2024-10-02, **Customized calibration sources in the JUNO experiment**, Akira Takenaka et.al., [2410.01571v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01571v1)

 We customized a laser calibration system and four radioactive $\gamma$-ray calibration sources for the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20-kton liquid scintillator-based neutrino detector. The laser source system was updated to realize the isotropic light emission timing within $\pm0.25$~nsec level and to allow the tuning of the laser intensity covering more than four orders of magnitude. In addition, methods to prepare four different radioactive sources ($^{18}{\rm F}$, $^{40}{\rm K}$, $^{226}{\rm Ra}$, and $^{241}{\rm Am}$), covering energies from O(10)~keV to O(1)~MeV, for the JUNO detector were established in this study. The radioactivity of each source and the risk of impurities leaking into the detector from the source were confirmed to meet the experimental requirements.

2024-10-02, **Search for quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillations with six detection units of KM3NeT/ORCA**, S. Aiello et.al., [2410.01388v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01388v2)

 Neutrinos described as an open quantum system may interact with the environment which introduces stochastic perturbations to their quantum phase. This mechanism leads to a loss of coherence along the propagation of the neutrino $-$ a phenomenon commonly referred to as decoherence $-$ and ultimately, to a modification of the oscillation probabilities. Fluctuations in space-time, as envisaged by various theories of quantum gravity, are a potential candidate for a decoherence-inducing environment. Consequently, the search for decoherence provides a rare opportunity to investigate quantum gravitational effects which are usually beyond the reach of current experiments. In this work, quantum decoherence effects are searched for in neutrino data collected by the KM3NeT/ORCA detector from January 2020 to November 2021. The analysis focuses on atmospheric neutrinos within the energy range of a few GeV to $100\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Adopting the open quantum system framework, decoherence is described in a phenomenological manner with the strength of the effect given by the parameters $\Gamma\_{21}$ and $\Gamma\_{31}$. Following previous studies, a dependence of the type $\Gamma\_{ij} \propto (E/E\_0)^n$ on the neutrino energy is assumed and the cases $n = -2,-1$ are explored. No significant deviation with respect to the standard oscillation hypothesis is observed. Therefore, $90\,\%$ CL upper limits are estimated as $\Gamma\_{21} < 4.6\cdot 10^{-21}\,$GeV and $\Gamma\_{31} < 8.4\cdot 10^{-21}\,$GeV for $n = -2$, and $\Gamma\_{21} < 1.9\cdot 10^{-22}\,$GeV and $\Gamma\_{31} < 2.7\cdot 10^{-22}\,$GeV for $n = -1$, respectively.

2024-10-02, **Addendum to `Combined Analysis of Neutrino Decoherence at Reactor Experiments'**, André de Gouvêa et.al., [2410.01357v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01357v1)

 We update our analyses to constrain neutrino decoherence induced by wave-packet separation with RENO and Daya Bay data, now including the final data sets of the two experiments. We find that while the individual bounds from Daya Bay and RENO data improve relative to our original estimates, the combined fits are still dominated by KamLAND data and are only minimally improved.

2024-10-02, **Prediction of the CP Phase $δ_{CP}$ in the Neutrino Oscillation and an Axion-less Solution to the Strong CP Problem**, Morimitsu Tanimoto et.al., [2410.01224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01224v1)

 A model of the axion-less solution to the strong CP problem has been recently constructed based on the $\bf T^2/\mathbb{Z}\_3$ orbifold in the six dimensional space-time. We extend, in this paper, the model to include the lepton sector with three right-handed neutrinos. A crucial point in the extended model is that we have only one CP-violating phase and thus the CP phase in the neutrino oscillation can be predicted by the CP phase in the CKM matrix. The CP phase $\delta\_{CP}$ in the PMNS matrix is predicted as $\delta\_{CP}\simeq 195^\circ - 200^\circ$   which can be tested in the near future experiments. We also discuss the effective mass $m\_{\beta\beta}$ responsible for the neutrino-less double beta decay of nucleus, which is predicted as $m\_{\beta\beta} \simeq 8-11$\,meV.

2024-10-02, **Measuring Solar neutrino Fluxes in Direct Detection Experiments in the Presence of Light Mediators**, Shuo-yu Xia et.al., [2410.01167v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01167v1)

 The potential of the dark matter direct detection experiments to provide independent measurements on solar neutrino fluxes in the Standard Model and in the presence of the light mediators is studied in this work. We also present the sensitivity of direct detection experiments on light mediators with solar neutrinos. We find that the sensitivities on $^8$B and pp neutrino fluxes can reach $\pm10\%$ with improved backgrounds and systematic uncertainties and they can be further pushed to $\pm3\%$ with a increased exposure. The constraints on light mediators can reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ for the masses of scalar and vector mediators below 10 MeV. However, the presence of scalar or vector mediators could lead to shifts in the best fit value of $^8$B fluxes, which will increase the challenges in the precise measurements of solar neutrino fluxes with direct detection experiments.

2024-10-02, **Fast Simulation of Cosmological Neutral Hydrogen based on the Halo Model**, Pascal Hitz et.al., [2410.01694v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01694v1)

 Cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys provide a promising tomographic probe of the post-reionization era and of the standard model of cosmology. Simulations of this signal are crucial for maximizing the utility of these surveys. We present a fast method for simulating the cosmological distribution of HI based on a halo model approach. Employing the approximate $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ code, we generate the past light cone of dark matter halos. Subsequently, the halos are populated with HI according to a HI-halo mass relation. The nature of 21 cm intensity mapping demands large-volume simulations with a high halo mass resolution. To fulfill both requirements, we simulate a past light cone for declinations between -15{\deg} and -35{\deg} in the frequency range from 700 to 800 MHz, matching HIRAX, the Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment. We run $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ for a 1 h$^{-3}$Gpc$^3$ box with 6700$^3$ simulation particles. With this configuration, halos with masses as low as M$\_\text{min}$ = 4.3 $\times$ 10$^{9}$M$\_{\odot}$ are simulated, resulting in the recovery of more than 97% of the expected HI density. From the dark matter and HI past light cone, maps with a width of 5 MHz are created. To validate the simulations, we have implemented and present here an analytical dark matter and HI halo model in $\texttt{PyCosmo}$, a Python package tailored for theoretical cosmological predictions. We perform extensive comparisons between analytical predictions and the simulations for the mass function, mass density, power spectrum, and angular power spectrum for dark matter and HI. We find close agreement in the mass function and mass densities, with discrepancies within a few percent. For the three-dimensional power spectra and angular power spectra, we observe an agreement better than 10%.

2024-10-02, **Probing Dark Relativistic Species and Their Interactions with Dark Matter through CMB and 21cm surveys**, Hugo Plombat et.al., [2410.01486v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01486v1)

 We investigate the sensitivity of the 21cm power spectrum from cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization to models of free-streaming dark radiation (parameterized through $N\_{\rm eff}$) and interacting dark radiation-dark matter models (DM-DR). The latter models have gained attention for their potential in addressing recent cosmological tensions and structure formation challenges. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis under different assumptions regarding the astrophysical modeling, and forecast the sensitivity of HERA observations, combined with CMB data from Planck and the Simons Observatory (SO), to $N\_{\rm eff}$ and DM-DR interaction modeled using the ETHOS framework assuming a constant scattering rate between the two components. Most importantly, we find that 21cm observations can improve the sensitivity to the DM-DR interaction rate by up to four order of magnitude compared to Planck and SO. Conversely, in the limit of low interaction rate (which asymptotically matches $N\_{\rm eff}$), CMB data dominates the constraining power, but the inclusion of HERA data can provide a $\sim 20\%$ improvement in sensitivity over CMB data alone. Moreover, we find that HERA observations will be able to probe a region of the DM-DR interaction parameter space which is promising to explain the weak lensing amplitude `$S\_8$' tension. Our results demonstrate the complementarity of 21cm and CMB data in exploring dark sector interactions.

2024-10-02, **Prospects for detecting asteroid-mass primordial black holes in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals with continuous gravitational waves**, Andrew L. Miller et.al., [2410.01348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01348v1)

 Despite decades of research, the existence of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) remains almost completely unconstrained and thus could still comprise the totality of dark matter (DM). In this paper, we show that standard searches for continuous gravitational waves -- long-lived, quasi-monochromatic signals -- could detect extreme mass-ratio inspirals of asteroid-mass PBHs in orbit around a stellar-mass companion using future gravitational-wave (GW) data from Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Neutron Star Extreme Matter Observatory (NEMO). We evaluate the robustness of our projected constraints against the eccentricity of the binary, the choice of the mass of the primary object, and the GW frequency range that we analyze. Furthermore, to determine whether there could be ways to detect asteroid-mass PBHs using current GW data, we quantify the impact of changes in current techniques on the sensitivity towards asteroid-mass PBHs. We show that methods that allow for signals with increased and more complicated frequency drifts over time could obtain much more stringent constraints now than those derived from standard techniques, though at slightly larger computational cost, potentially constraining the fraction of DM that certain asteroid-mass PBHs could compose to be less than one with current detectors.

2024-10-02, **TIC 290061484: A Triply Eclipsing Triple System with the Shortest Known Outer Period of 24.5 Days**, Veselin B. Kostov et.al., [2410.01711v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01711v1)

 We have discovered a triply eclipsing triple-star system, TIC 290061484, with the shortest known outer period, Pout, of only 24.5 days. This "eclipses" the previous record set by lambda Tauri at 33.02 days, which held for 68 yr. The inner binary, with an orbital period of Pin = 1.8 days, produces primary and secondary eclipses and exhibits prominent eclipse timing variations with the same periodicity as the outer orbit. The tertiary star eclipses, and is eclipsed by, the inner binary with pronounced asymmetric profiles. The inclinations of both orbits evolve on observable timescales such that the third-body eclipses exhibit dramatic depth variations in TESS data. A photodynamical model provides a complete solution for all orbital and physical parameters of the triple system, showing that the three stars have masses of 6.85, 6.11, and 7.90 MSun, radii near those corresponding to the main sequence, and Teff in the range of 21,000-23,700 K. Remarkably, the model shows that the triple is in fact a subsystem of a hierarchical 2+1+1 quadruple with a distant fourth star. The outermost star has a period of ~3200 days and a mass comparable to the stars in the inner triple. In ~20 Myr, all three components of the triple subsystem will merge, undergo a Type II supernova explosion, and leave a single remnant neutron star. At the time of writing, TIC 290061484 is the most compact triple system and one of the tighter known compact triples (i.e., Pout/Pin = 13.7).

2024-10-02, **Late-Time Supernovae Radio Re-brightening in the VAST Pilot Survey**, Kovi Rose et.al., [2410.01375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01375v1)

 We present our analysis of supernovae serendipitously found to be radio-bright several years after their optical discovery. We used recent observations from the Australian SKA Pathfinder taken as part of the pilot Variables and Slow Transients and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey programs. We identified 29 objects by cross-matching sources from these ASKAP observations with known core-collapse supernovae below a declination of $+40^{\circ}$ and with a redshift of $z\leq0.15$. Our results focus on eight cases that show potential late-time radio emission. These supernovae exhibit significantly greater amounts of radio emission than expected from the standard model of a single shockwave propagating through a spherical circumstellar medium, with a constant density structure produced by regular stellar mass-loss. We also discuss how we can learn from future ASKAP surveys about the circumstellar environments and emission mechanisms of supernovae that undergo late-time radio re-brightening. This pilot work tested and confirmed the potential of the Variables and Slow Transients survey to discover and study late-time supernova emission.
