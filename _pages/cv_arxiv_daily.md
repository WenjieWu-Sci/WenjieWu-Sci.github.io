2023-12-19, **Searching for Axial Neutral Current Non-Standard Interactions of neutrinos by DUNE-like experiments**, Saeed Abbaslu et.al., [2312.12420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12420v1)

 The increasingly precise neutrino experiments raise the hope for searching for new physics through studying the impact of Neutral Current (NC) Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter fields. Neutrino oscillation experiments along with the Elastic Coherent $\nu$ Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) experiments already set strong bounds on all the flavor elements of the "vector" NC NSI. However, "axial" NC NSI can hide from these experiments. We show how a DUNE-like experiment can probe these couplings by studying NC Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) events. We find that strong bounds can be set on the axial NC NSI of neutrinos with the $u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks. We show that using both the near and far detectors, a DUNE-like experiment can significantly improve the present bounds on all the flavor elements.

2023-12-19, **The PMT System of the TRIDENT Pathfinder Experiment**, Fuyudi Zhang et.al., [2312.12327v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12327v1)

 Next generation neutrino telescopes are highly anticipated to boost the development of neutrino astronomy. A multi-cubic-kilometer neutrino telescope, TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT), was proposed to be built in the South China Sea. The detector aims to achieve ~ 0.1 degree angular resolution for track-like events at energy above 100 TeV by using hybrid digital optical modules, opening new opportunities for neutrino astronomy. In order to measure the water optical properties and marine environment of the proposed TRIDENT site, a pathfinder experiment was conducted, in which a 100-meter-long string consisting of three optical modules was deployed at a depth of 3420 m to perform in-situ measurements. The central module emits light by housing LEDs, whereas the other two modules detect light with two independent and complementary systems: the PMT and the camera systems. By counting the number of detected photons and analyzing the photon arrival time distribution, the PMT system can measure the absorption and scattering lengths of sea water, which serve as the basic inputs for designing the neutrino telescope. In this paper, we present the design concept, calibration and performance of the PMT system in the pathfinder experiment.

2023-12-19, **Self Interacting Dark Matter and Dirac neutrinos via Lepton Quarticity**, Satyabrata Mahapatra et.al., [2312.12322v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12322v1)

 In this paper, we put forward a connection between the self-interacting dark matter and the Dirac nature of neutrinos. Our exploration involves a $Z\_4 \otimes Z\_4'$ discrete symmetry, wherein the Dirac neutrino mass is produced through a type-I seesaw mechanism. This symmetry not only contributes to the generation of the Dirac neutrino mass but also facilitates the realization of self-interacting dark matter with a light mediator that can alleviate small-scale anomalies of the $\Lambda {\rm CDM}$ while being consistent with the latter at large scales, as suggested by astrophysical observations. Thus the stability of the DM and Dirac nature of neutrinos are shown to stem from the same underlying symmetry. The model also features additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N\_{\rm eff}$ of either thermal or non-thermal origin, within the reach of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment providing a complementary probe in addition to the detection prospects of DM.

2023-12-19, **Neutrino-Driven Outflows and the Elemental Abundance Patterns of Very Metal-Poor Stars**, A. Psaltis et.al., [2312.12306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12306v1)

 The elemental abundances between strontium and silver ($Z = 38-47$) observed in the atmospheres of very metal-poor stars (VMP) in the Galaxy may contain the fingerprint of the weak $r$-process and $\nu p$-process occurring in early core-collapse supernovae explosions. In this work, we combine various astrophysical conditions based on a steady-state model to cover the richness of the supernova ejecta in terms of entropy, expansion timescale, and electron fraction. The calculated abundances based on different combinations of conditions are compared with stellar observations with the aim of constraining supernova ejecta conditions. We find that some conditions of the neutrino-driven outflows consistently reproduce the observed abundances of our sample. In addition, from the successful combinations, the neutron-rich trajectories better reproduce the observed abundances of Sr-Zr ($Z= 38-40$), while the proton-rich ones, Mo-Pd ($Z= 42-47$).

2023-12-19, **Celestial Objects as Dark Matter Colliders**, Thong T. Q. Nguyen et.al., [2312.12292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12292v1)

 In the vicinity of the Milky Way Galactic Center, celestial bodies, including neutron stars, reside within a dense dark matter environment. This study explores the accumulation of dark matter by neutron stars through dark matter-nucleon interactions, leading to increased internal dark matter density. Consequently, dark matter annihilation produces long-lived mediators that escape and decay into neutrinos. Leveraging experimental limits from IceCube, ANTARES, and future projections from ARIA, we establish constraints on the dark matter-nucleon cross section within a simplified dark $U(1)\_{X}$ mediator model. This approach, applicable to various celestial objects and dark matter models, offers insights into the intricate interplay between dark matter and neutron stars near the Galactic Center.

2023-12-19, **Primordial Black Hole Sterile Neutrinogenesis: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production Independent of Couplings**, Muping Chen et.al., [2312.12136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12136v1)

 Sterile neutrinos ($\nu\_s$s) are well-motivated and actively searched for hypothetical neutral particles that would mix with the Standard Model active neutrinos. They are considered prime warm dark matter (DM) candidates, typically when their mass is in the keV range, although they can also be hot or cold DM components. We discuss in detail the characteristics and phenomenology of $\nu\_s$s that minimally couple only to active neutrinos and are produced in the evaporation of early Universe primordial black holes (PBHs), a process we called ``PBH sterile neutrinogenesis". Contrary to the previously studied $\nu\_s$ production mechanisms, this novel mechanism does not depend on the active-sterile mixing. The resulting $\nu\_s$s have a distinctive spectrum and are produced with larger energies than in typical scenarios. This characteristic enables $\nu\_s$s to be WDM in the unusual $0.3$ MeV to $0.3$ TeV mass range, if PBHs do not matter-dominate the Universe before evaporating. When PBHs matter-dominate before evaporating, the possible coincidence of induced gravitational waves associated with PBH evaporation and astrophysical X-ray observations from $\nu\_s$ decays constitutes a distinct signature of our scenario. constitutes a distinct signature of our scenario.

2023-12-19, **Quantum field theories of relativistic Luttinger fermions**, Holger Gies et.al., [2312.12058v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12058v1)

 We propose relativistic Luttinger fermions as a new ingredient for the construction of fundamental quantum field theories. We construct the corresponding Clifford algebra and the spin metric for relativistic invariance of the action using the spin-base invariant formalism. The corresponding minimal spinor has 32 complex components, matching with the degrees of freedom of a standard-model generation including a right-handed neutrino. The resulting fermion fields exhibit a canonical scaling different from Dirac fermions and thus support the construction of novel relativistic and perturbatively renormalizable, interacting quantum field theories. In particular, new asymptotically free self-interacting field theories can be constructed, representing first examples of high-energy complete quantum field theories based on pure matter degrees of freedom. Gauge theories with relativistic Luttinger fermions exhibit a strong paramagnetic dominance, requiring large nonabelian gauge groups to maintain asymptotic freedom. We comment on the possibility to use Luttinger fermions for particle physics model building and the expected naturalness properties of such models.

2023-12-19, **The Hubble tension as a window on the gravitation of the dark matter sector: exploration of a family of models**, Jean-Philippe Uzan et.al., [2312.12408v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12408v1)

 A family of simple and minimal extensions of the standard cosmological $\Lambda$CDM model in which dark matter experiences an additional long-range scalar interaction is demonstrated to alleviate the long lasting Hubble-tension while letting primordial nucleosynthesis predictions unaffected and passing by construction all current local tests of general relativity. This article describes their theoretical formulation and their implications for dark matter. Then, it investigates their cosmological signatures, both at the background and perturbation levels. A detailed comparison to astrophysical data is performed to discuss their ability to fit existing data. A thorough discussion of the complementarity of the low- and high-redshift data and on their constraining power highlights how these models improve the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model whatever the combination of datasets used and why they can potentially resolve the Hubble tension. Being fully predictive in any environment, they pave the way to a better understanding of gravity in the dark matter sector.

2023-12-19, **PNG-UNITsims: the response of halo clustering to Primodial Non-Gaussianities as a function of mass**, Adrian G. Adame et.al., [2312.12405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12405v1)

 We present the largest full N-body simulation to date with local primordial non-Gaussianities (L-PNG), the \textsc{PNG-UNITsim}. It tracks the evolution of $4096^3$ particles within a periodic box with $L\_{\rm box} = 1 \; h^{-1}\,{\rm Gpc}$, leading to a mass resolution of $m\_{p} = 1.24\times 10^{9}\; h^{-1}\,M\_\odot$. This is enough to resolve galaxies targeted by stage-IV spectroscopic surveys. The \textsc{PNG-UNIT} has \textit{Fixed} initial conditions whose phases are also \textit{Matched} to the pre-existing \textsc{UNIT} simulation. These two features in the simulations reduce our uncertainty significantly so we use 100 \textsc{FastPM} mocks to estimate this reduction. The amplitude of the non-Gaussianities used to set the initial conditions of this new simulation is $f\_{\rm NL}^{\rm local} = 100$. In this first study, we use mass selected dark matter haloes from the \textsc{PNG-UNIT} simulation to constrain the local PNG parameters. PNG induce a scale dependent bias, parameterised through \bp or $p$, which might depend on the type of cosmological tracer. Those cases when $p=1$ are referred to as the {\it universality relation}. We measure $p$ as a function of the halo mass. Haloes with masses between $1\times 10^{12}$ and $2\times 10^{13} \, h^{-1} M\_\odot$ are well described by the {\it universality relation}. For haloes with masses between $2\times 10^{10}$ and $1\times 10^{12} \, h^{-1} M\_\odot$ we find that $p<1$ at $3\sigma$. Combining all the mass bins, we find $p$ consistent with a value of $0.955\pm0.013$, which is $3\sigma$ away from \textit{universality}, as low mass haloes are more numerous. We also study the effect of using priors on $p$ when constraining $f\_{\rm NL}$. Using the values we obtain for $b\_\phi$ as priors, we forecast that a DESI-like (stage-IV) survey will be able to constrain $f\_{\rm NL}$ better than if the universality relation is assumed.

2023-12-19, **Galaxy clustering measurements out to redshift z$\sim$8 from Hubble Legacy Fields**, Nicolò Dalmasso et.al., [2312.12329v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12329v1)

 We present a novel approach for measuring the two-point correlation function of galaxies in narrow pencil beam surveys with varying depths. Our methodology is utilized to expand high-redshift galaxy clustering investigations up to $z \sim 8$ by analyzing a comprehensive sample consisting of $N\_g = 160$ Lyman break galaxy candidates obtained through optical and near-infrared photometric data within the CANDELS GOODS datasets from the Hubble Space Telescope Legacy Fields. For bright sources with $M\_{UV} < -19.8$, we determine a galaxy bias of $b = 9.33\pm4.90$ at $\overline{z} = 7.7$ and a correlation length of $r\_0 = 10.74\pm7.06$ $h^{-1}Mpc$. We obtain similar results for the XDF, with a galaxy bias measurement of $b = 8.26\pm3.41$ at the same redshift for a slightly fainter sample with a median luminosity of $M\_{UV} = -18.4$. By comparing with dark-matter halo bias and employing abundance matching, we deduce a characteristic halo mass of $M\_h \sim 10^{11.5} M\_{\odot}$ and a duty cycle close to unity. To validate our approach for variable-depth datasets, we replicate the analysis in a region with near-uniform depth using a standard two-point correlation function estimator, yielding consistent outcomes. Our study not only provides a valuable tool for future utilization in JWST datasets but also suggests that the clustering of early galaxies continues to increase with redshift beyond $z \gtrsim 8$, potentially contributing to the existence of protocluster structures observed in early JWST imaging and spectroscopic surveys at $z \gtrsim 8$.

2023-12-19, **A new model for dark matter phase space distribution**, Zhen Li et.al., [2312.12304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12304v1)

 Understanding the nature of dark matter is among the top priorities of modern physics. However, due to its inertness, it is very difficult to detect and study it directly in terrestrial experiments. Numerical N-body simulations are currently the best approach to study the particle properties and phase space distribution, by assuming the collisionless nature of dark matter particles. These simulations also compensate for the fact that we do not have a satisfactory theory for predicting the universal properties of dark matter halos, such as the density profile and velocity distribution. In this work, we propose a new analytical model of dark matter phase space distribution that could provide a NFW-like density profile and velocity distribution, as well as velocity component distributions, which agree very well with the simulation data. Our model is relevant both for theoretical modelling of dark matter distributions, as well as for underground detector experiments, which need the dark matter velocity distribution for the experimental analysis.

2023-12-19, **Relativistic effects cannot explain galactic dynamics**, L. Filipe O. Costa et.al., [2312.12302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12302v1)

 It has been suggested in recent literature that non-linear and/or gravitomagnetic general relativistic effects can play a leading role in galactic dynamics, partially or totally replacing dark matter. Using the 1+3 "quasi-Maxwell" formalism, we show, on general grounds, such hypothesis to be impossible.

2023-12-19, **Stochastic Ultralight Dark Matter Fluctuations in Pulsar Timing Arrays**, Hyungjin Kim et.al., [2312.12225v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12225v1)

 Metric perturbations induced by ultralight dark matter (ULDM) fields have long been identified as a potential target for pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. Previous works have focused on the coherent oscillation of metric perturbations at the characteristic frequency set by the ULDM mass. In this work, we show that ULDM fields source low-frequency stochastic metric fluctuations and that these low-frequency fluctuations can produce distinctive detectable signals in PTA data. Using the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set and synthetic data sets mimicking present and future PTA capabilities, we show that the current and future PTA observations provide the strongest probe of ULDM density within the solar system for masses in the range of $10^{-18}\;{\rm eV}-10^{-16}\;{\rm eV}$.

2023-12-19, **The impact of an evolving stellar initial mass function on early galaxies and reionisation**, Elie Rasmussen Cueto et.al., [2312.12109v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12109v1)

 Observations with JWST have revealed an unexpected high abundance of bright z>10 galaxy candidates. We explore whether a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy towards higher redshifts and lower gas-phase metallicities results in a higher abundance of bright objects in the early universe and how it affects the evolution of galaxy properties compared to a constant IMF. We incorporate such an evolving IMF into the Astraeus framework that couples galaxy evolution and reionisation in the first billion years. Our implementation accounts for the IMF dependence of supernova feedback, metal enrichment, ionising and ultraviolet radiation emission. We conduct two simulations: one with a Salpeter IMF and one with the evolving IMF. Compared to a constant Salpeter IMF, we find that (i) the higher abundance of massive stars in the evolving IMF results in more light per unit stellar mass, a slower build-up of stellar mass and lower stellar-to-halo mass ratio; (ii) due to the self-similar growth of the underlying dark matter halos, the evolving IMF's star formation main sequence hardly deviates from that of the Salpeter IMF; (iii) the evolving IMF's stellar mass-metallicity relation shifts to higher metallicities while its halo mass-metallicity relation remains unchanged; (iv) the evolving IMF's median dust-to-metal mass ratio is lower due to its stronger SN feedback; (v) the evolving IMF requires lower values of the escape fraction of ionising photons and exhibits a flatter median relation and smaller scatter between the ionising photons emerging from galaxies and the halo mass. Yet, the topology of the ionised regions hardly changes compared to the Salpeter IMF. These results suggest that a top-heavier IMF alone is unlikely to explain the higher abundance of bright z>10 sources, since the lower mass-to-light ratio is counteracted by the stronger stellar feedback.

2023-12-19, **Thermalization and Annihilation of Dark Matter in Neutron Stars**, Nicole F. Bell et.al., [2312.11892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11892v1)

 The capture of dark matter, and its subsequent annihilation, can heat old, isolated neutron stars. In order for kinetic heating to be achieved, the captured dark matter must undergo sufficient scattering to deposit its kinetic energy in the star. We find that this energy deposit typically occurs quickly, for most of the relevant parameter space. In order for appreciable annihilation heating to also be achieved, the dark matter must reach a state of capture-annihilation equilibrium in the star. We show that this can be fulfilled for all types of dark matter - baryon interactions. This includes cases where the scattering or annihilation cross sections are momentum or velocity suppressed in the non-relativistic limit. Importantly, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium, and hence maximal annihilation heating, can be achieved without complete thermalization of the captured dark matter. For scattering cross sections that saturate the capture rate, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium is typically reached on a timescale of less than $1$ year for vector interactions and $10^4$ years for scalar interactions.

 The addition of a Higgs quadruplet to the standard model (SM) of quarks and leptons would shift the $W$ boson mass upward. It could also facilitate the production of dark matter through the conventional thermal freeze-out scenario via Yukawa interaction with the Higgs quadruplet or freeze-in production from the decay of SM Higgs. We investigate the same-sign lepton smoking gun signature of the double-charged scalar component of the Quadruplet Higgs at the LHC.

2023-12-19, **ASASSN-18ap: A Dusty Tidal Disruption Event Candidate with an Early Bump in the Light Curve or an extraodinary Type IIn supernovae**, Yibo Wang et.al., [2312.12015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12015v1)

 We re-examined the classification of the optical transient ASASSN-18ap, which was initially identified as a supernova (SNe) upon its discovery. Based on newly emerged phenomena, such as a delayed luminous infrared outburst and the emergence of luminous coronal emission lines, we suggest that ASASSN-18ap is more likely a tidal disruption event (TDE) in a dusty environment, rather than a supernova. The total energy in the infrared outburst is $\rm 3.1\times10^{51}$ erg, which is an order of magnitude higher than the total energy in the optical-to-ultraviolet range, indicating a large dust extinction, an extra-EUV component, or anisotropic continuum emission. A bumpy feature appeared in the optical light curve at the start of brightening, which was reported in a couple of TDEs very recently. This early bump may have been overlooked in the past due to the lack of sufficient sampling of the light curves of most TDEs during their ascending phase, and it could provide insight into the origin of optical emission.
