2025-11-25, **Optimization of the X-Arapuca Photon Collection Efficiency for the DUNE Horizontal Drift Far Detector**, E. Bertolini et.al., [2511.20400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20400v1)

 The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) Far Detector (FD) Photon Detection System (PDS) employs the X-Arapuca concept, a photon trapping system relying on reflective surfaces and dichroic filters. In this paper are reported measurements, performed at the University of Milano-Bicocca, aimed at increasing the FD Horizontal Drift (HD) PDS module efficiency. The baseline implementation of the X-Arapuca concept for the FD-HD PDS module is close to the DUNE requirements as demonstrated in the collaborations laboratory testing. However, an increased performance would provide a safety margin for a detector planned to be operated for 30 years, without possibility of performing maintenance. A higher detector performance would also benefit the DUNE low energy physics program. The already proven Milano-Bicocca setup has been utilized to test different PDS module configurations comparing them to the original baseline. Exploiting prior knowledge of the X-Arapuca components and Geant4 based optical simulations it has been possible to achieve up to an ~84% performance increase over the baseline design. In the following it is presented the testing procedure, the performed measurements and a brief discussion on the obtained results.

2025-11-25, **Revisiting lepton flavor violation: $τ$ and meson decays**, Kevin A. Urquía-Calderón et.al., [2511.20320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20320v1)

 The minimal type-I seesaw model provides a simple explanation of neutrino flavor oscillations and induces charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV). Despite extensive previous studies, semileptonic cLFV channels remain underexplored. Using updated form factors, decay constants, and oscillation data, we revisit $τ$ and meson decay channels, performing a systematic comparison across the seesaw parameter space. Surprisingly, we find that decays such as $τ\to \ellρ$ can dominate over purely leptonic $τ$-sector probes, including $τ\to 3\ell$ and even $τ\to\ell\,γ$, in certain regions. In contrast, heavy-meson decays remain far below experimental sensitivity. Considering global constraints on the seesaw parameters, we derive branching ratios for the relevant cLFV processes and identify those within potential reach of next-generation experiments.

2025-11-25, **Search for the potential electromagnetic counterparts of neutrino events in SDSS galaxies at z<0.1**, O. Sergijenko. et.al., [2511.20184v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20184v1)

 Identification of electromagnetic emission in coincidence with high-energy neutrinos is fundamentally important for multimessenger astronomy. Such observations are essential for constraining source localization, determining the source type, and understanding emission mechanisms. Typically, they require following up a neutrino alert (IceCube issues two alert streams: Gold, with at least 50 percent probability of astrophysical origin, and Bronze, with at least 30 percent probability) with an electromagnetic facility, primarily in X-ray and gamma-ray bands. Another approach involves electromagnetic monitoring of hot spots in the IceCube skymap, i.e., positions exceeding the instrument sensitivity. An alternative method consists in performing correlation analysis across available neutrino events and source catalogs. We searched for spatial coincidence between galaxies from SDSS and high-energy neutrino events. The analysis includes IceCube Gold alerts and neutrino-electromagnetic coincidence events from AMON (Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network), identified through the end of September 2025. We examined galaxies from the morphological catalog at redshifts 0.02 to 0.1, which contains 315,776 SDSS DR9 objects with absolute stellar magnitudes in the range from -24 to -13 in the r band. Among 59 IceCube Gold alerts, we found three with only one galaxy (SDSS J231231.52+033415.1) within the 50 percent containment radius. Among 24 neutrino-electromagnetic coincidence events, three more contain only one galaxy (SDSS J220711.14+122535.9) within the same radius. These six galaxies represent the most promising candidates for potential host galaxies of neutrino sources. We summarize their available multiwavelength data and the ZTF light curves obtained from 2018 to 2025.

2025-11-25, **Is the large uncertainty of $δ_{CP}$ fundamentally encoded in the neutrino quantum state?**, Michela Ignoti et.al., [2511.20148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20148v1)

 The precise measurement of the leptonic CP-violating phase $δ\_{CP}$ remains one of the major open challenges in neutrino physics, as current experiments achieve only very limited accuracy. We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $δ\_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $δ\_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$ν$SB proposal, substantially enhances $δ\_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum.

2025-11-25, **Calibration Plan for the SBC 10-kg Liquid Argon Detector with 100 eV Target Threshold**, SBC collaboration et.al., [2511.19817v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19817v1)

 The Scintillating Bubble Chamber (SBC) Collaboration is designing a new generation of low background, noble liquid bubble chamber experiments with sub-keV nuclear recoil threshold. These experiments combine the electronic recoil blindness of a bubble chamber with the energy resolution of noble liquid scintillation, and maintain electron recoil discrimination at higher degrees of superheat (lower nuclear recoil thresholds) than Freon-based bubble chambers. A 10-kg liquid argon bubble chamber has the potential to set world leading limits on the dark matter nucleon cross-section for $O(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2})$ masses, and to perform a high statistics coherent elastic neutrino nuclear scattering measurement with reactor neutrinos. This work presents a detailed calibration plan to measure the detector response of these experiments, combining photoneutron scattering with two new techniques to induce sub-keV nuclear recoils: nuclear Thomson scattering and thermal neutron capture.

2025-11-24, **Two Puzzles, One Solution: Neutrino Mass and Secluded Dark Matter**, Mattia Di Mauro et.al., [2511.19622v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19622v1)

 We present a minimal secluded dark-matter (DM) framework based on an extra $U(1)\_X$ gauge symmetry. The model contains a Dirac DM particle $χ$, three heavy neutrinos $N\_I$ with masses $M\_{N,I}$, and a singlet scalar $R$ that mixes with the Standard Model Higgs doublet $Φ$ by an angle $α$. A symmetry forbids the $Φ$-$R$ portal at tree level; the leading portal then arises at one loop from the same Yukawa structures that generate active neutrino masses $m\_{ν,I}$, implying $\tan(2α) \propto \sum\_I m\_{ν,I} M^2\_{N,I}/(v\_h m\_H^2)$, where $v\_h$ and $m\_H$ are the SM Higgs VEV and mass. For heavy-neutrino masses in the multi-TeV range, this yields a naturally tiny mixing, $\tan(2α)\sim 5\times 10^{-11}\left(M\_N/10~\mathrm{TeV}\right)^2$, which strongly suppresses DM signals in direct, indirect, and collider searches. For PeV-scale heavy neutrinos the DM-nucleon cross section can instead enter the reach of direct-detection experiments. The visible and dark sectors thermalize at temperatures of order a few times the mass of the lightest heavy neutrino, then subsequently decouple, and typically evolve with a slightly hotter dark bath. In the secluded regime, with $\tan(2α)\ll 1$ and $m\_χ>m\_{H\_p}$, the relic density is set by $p$-wave annihilation $χ\barχ\to H\_p H\_p$ (with $H\_p$ the Higgs-like particle of the dark sector), and the dark-sector Yukawa couplings required to reproduce the observed abundance are $\sim(0.1\text{-}1)$, as in the standard WIMP case. For heavy-neutrino masses $\gtrsim 10~\mathrm{TeV}$, the mediator decays before nucleosynthesis without spoiling BBN observables, while the tiny portal suppresses present-day signals below current and near-future sensitivities. This links two long-standing puzzles, the absence of DM signals and the smallness of neutrino masses, within a predictive thermal framework.

2025-11-24, **Refractive neutrino masses in the solar DM halo: Can the dark-LMA solution be revived?**, Susobhan Chattopadhyay et.al., [2511.19420v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19420v1)

 Neutrinos can acquire "refractive masses" as a consequence of their interactions with ultralight dark matter (DM). We explore a model with two additional sterile neutrinos and an ultralight scalar field which acts as DM and interacts with all five neutrinos. We show that the effective $5 \times 5$ Hamiltonian for neutrino propagation can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix $\mathbb{P}$ parametrized by 6 mixing angles and 1 complex phase. When active-sterile mixing angles are small, we identify a parametrization for $\mathbb{P}$ that reduces neutrino propagation inside the Sun to a two-flavor problem for a uniform DM background. In the presence of a DM halo inside the Sun, however, the propagation shows additional features in the region of halo dominance. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the electron neutrino survival probability in the presence of the DM halo. We show that this probability has a strong dependence on the neutrino production region even for a fixed energy, and numerically calculate the effects of averaging over these production regions. Comparisons with the re-interpreted solar data, in the light of possible active-sterile neutrino conversions, would allow putting bounds on the halo parameters. Finally, we examine the possibility of reviving the dark-LMA solution in this context, where the survival probability spectrum can have attractive features aligned with the measurements at Super-Kamiokande.

2025-11-24, **Viability of $A_4$, $S_4$ and $A_5$ Flavour Symmetries in Light of the First JUNO Result**, S. T. Petcov et.al., [2511.19408v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19408v1)

 We update the analysis of the viability of the lepton mixing patterns originating from $A\_4$, $S\_4$ and $A\_5$ discrete flavour symmetries and leading to predictions for the solar neutrino mixing angle, $θ\_{12}$. We perform a statistical analysis using as an input (i) the results of the latest global fit to neutrino oscillation data, and (ii) the first JUNO measurement of $\sin^2θ\_{12}$. Out of the five (four) cases compatible with the global data at $3σ$ for normal (inverted) neutrino mass ordering, only three (two) cases remain compatible with the global data at the same confidence level after taking into account the JUNO result.

2025-11-24, **Gravitational Wave Probe of Singlet-Doublet Dark Matter Induced Radiative Neutrino Mass**, Ujjal Kumar Dey et.al., [2511.19386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19386v1)

 We investigate an one loop radiative neutrino mass model, where the loop particles, notably a singlet fermion ($χ$), a doublet fermion ($Ψ$) and three generations of singlet scalars ($φ\_i, i=\{1,2,3\}$) are assumed to be odd under an additional $\mathcal{Z}\_2$-symmetry. In this setup, the singlet fermion mixes with the neutral component of the doublet to give rise singlet-doublet Majorana dark matter. The addition of $\mathcal{Z}\_2$ odd scalars in the model provides rich phenomenological implications. We find that the quartic interaction terms between the SM Higgs and $φ\_i$s play a significant role in modifying the scalar potential to have a first-order phase transition (FOPT) leading to observable gravitational waves (GWs) spectra. We also examine the non-trivial role played by the singlet-doublet fermion DM and the scalars in loop-induced neutrino mass, $(g-2)\_μ$, and lepton flavor violation. We find that the model is predictive due to the combined constraints and can be verified at different terrestrial experiments.

2025-11-24, **Limits on GeV-scale WIMP Annihilation in Dwarf Spheroidals with IceCube DeepCore**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2511.19385v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19385v1)

 Dark matter is approximately five times more abundant than baryonic matter in the universe, but its physical nature continues to elude physicists. One potential candidate for dark matter is a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), which is predicted by various extensions to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. After becoming gravitationally bound in cosmic structures, WIMPs can self-annihilate and produce SM particles including neutrinos, which are observable by detectors like IceCube. We present a search for neutrinos from low-mass $(\leq 300 \, \mathrm{GeV})$ WIMP annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with over seven years of IceCube livetime. We find no statistically significant evidence of neutrinos produced by WIMP annihilation, and therefore set upper limits on the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section $\left<σv\right>$. Our strongest upper limits at the 90\% confidence level are $\mathcal{O}\!\left(10^{-22} \, \mathrm{{cm}^{3} \, s^{-1}}\right)$ for WIMP annihilation directly into neutrino-antineutrino pairs. For our least sensitive channel, the corresponding limits are $\mathcal{O}\!\left(10^{-20} \, \mathrm{{cm}^{3} \, s^{-1}}\right)$, which is an improvement of over two orders of magnitude over previous IceCube limits from dwarf galaxies at the upper end of our mass range.

2025-11-24, **Scalarful double beta decay**, Jordy de Vries et.al., [2511.19173v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19173v1)

 We revisit scalar emissions in double beta decays of nuclei, often discussed in the context of Majoron models, in light of the latest developments on the study of neutrinoless double beta decay amplitudes from an effective field theory approach. The sensitivity of double beta decay experiments to this process is assessed through an analysis of spectral shapes, and the study is extended to massive scalars, scalars coupling to sterile neutrinos, and exotic right-handed effective couplings.

2025-11-24, **Cryogenic characterization of FBK NUV-HD-Cryo 3T SiPM sensors for the DUNE photon detection system**, F. Acerbi et.al., [2511.19095v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19095v1)

 The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino experiment based in the USA and composed of a Near Detector (ND) complex at Fermi National Laboratory (FNAL), and a Far Detector (FD) complex located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) $\sim$1300\,km distant. DUNE will study neutrino oscillations looking for unresolved issues of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) such as CP violation in the leptonic sector, neutrino mass ordering and others, starting from the early 2030s. The FD, with a mass of $\sim$17\,kt, that will exploit both ionization and scintillation signals to detect neutrino interactions with Argon. Scintillating photons in LAr will be detected by the photon detection system (PDS) based on light collectors coupled to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). During a test campaign, different laboratories of the collaboration performed an investigation of the best SiPM candidates that fulfill the DUNE FD requirements. We identified two models of SiPM, produced by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (HPK) and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), respectively. In this paper, we focus on the FBK selected model showing its main features. We will describe the characterization protocol, the results at both room and cryogenic temperatures and the photon detection efficiency measurements.

2025-11-24, **Enhancing low energy reconstruction and classification in KM3NeT/ORCA with transformers**, Iván Mozún Mateo et.al., [2511.18999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18999v1)

 The current KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescope, still under construction, has not yet reached its full potential in neutrino reconstruction capability. When training any deep learning model, no explicit information about the physics or the detector is provided, thus they remain unknown to the model. This study leverages the strengths of transformers by incorporating attention masks inspired by the physics and detector design, making the model understand both the telescope design and the neutrino physics measured on it. The study also shows the efficacy of transformers on retaining valuable information between detectors when doing fine-tuning from one configurations to another.

2025-11-24, **The variability of blazars throughout the electromagnetic spectrum**, Claudia M. Raiteri et.al., [2511.18975v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18975v1)

 With their jet pointing towards us, blazars are ideal tools to study the physics and structure of extragalactic jets. Their powerful jets are cosmic particle accelerators and are alleged to be one of the production sites of the high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory. Doppler beaming of the jet nonthermal radiation increases blazar brightness, blue-shifts their emission, and shortens their variability time scales, which are observed to range from years down to minutes. This review will focus on blazar flux, spectral, and polarization variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Interpretation of blazar variability calls into question both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Shock waves, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence can accelerate particles inside the jet, while jet precession, rotation, and twisting can produce variations in Doppler beaming. Microvariability puts strong constraints on the size of the emitting regions, suggesting a multizone emitting jet. Twisting jets have been proposed to explain the long-term multiwavelength variability. They are supported by radio observations of bent or helical jets, and by results of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of plasma jets. Detection of (quasi)periodic behaviour has been ascribed to orbital motion in black hole binary systems, jet precession, kink instabilities developing inside the jet, or perturbations in the accretion disc. Gravitational microlensing has been suggested to explain blazar behaviour in some cases. Polarization provides information on the structure and behaviour of the magnetic field in the emission zones. Both the degree and angle of polarization can show strong and fast variability, which is sometimes correlated with flux. The interpretation of flux, spectral, and polarization variability within a consistent picture challenges current models of blazar variability.

2025-11-24, **GPS-Synchronized Monitoring of Supernova Bursts in PandaX-4T: Enabling a Neutrino Trigger for Multi-Messenger Astronomy**, Binyu Pang et.al., [2511.18916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18916v1)

 The landmark detection of neutrinos from SN 1987A marked the dawn of a new era in astrophysics, unequivocally establishing them as indispensable probes for investigating stellar evolution and supernova dynamics. Today, supernova burst neutrinos can be observed through coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering in tonne-scale liquid xenon detectors designed for direct dark matter detection. Capitalizing on this capability, we have developed and deployed a real-time supernova monitoring system for the PandaX-4T experiment. This system incorporates a GPS module providing millisecond-level timing precision, achieves a low false-alarm rate, and maintains high sensitivity to galactic supernova events. This robust methodology is directly scalable and slated for implementation in the next-generation PandaX-20T experiment.

2025-11-24, **Measurement of Milli-Charged Particles with a running electromagnetic coupling constant at IceCube**, Ye Xu et.al., [2511.18881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18881v1)

 It is assumed that heavy dark matter $φ$ with O(TeV) mass captured by the Earth may decay to relativistic light milli-charged particles (MCPs). These MCPs could be measured by the IceCube neutrino telescope. The massless hidden photon model was taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei with a running electromagnetic coupling constant, so that the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs may be evaluated at IceCube. Meanwhile, the numbers of expected neutrino background events were also evaluated at IceCube. Based on the assumption that no events are observed at IceCube in 10 years, the corresponding upper limits on MCP fluxes were calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicated that the MCPs from the Earth's core could be directly detected at O(1TeV) energies at IceCube when $5.65\times10^{-5}\lesssimε^2\lesssim1.295\times10^{-3}$. And a new region of 4 GeV < $m\_{MCP}$ < 100 GeV and $5.51\times10^{-2}$ < $ε$ < 0.612 is ruled out in the $m\_{MCP}$-$ε$ plane with 10 years of IceCube data.

2025-11-24, **Development of a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber prototype for the RELICS experiment**, Lingfeng Xie et.al., [2511.18693v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18693v1)

 The RELICS (REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent elastic Scattering) experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from reactor antineutrinos using a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. To validate the detector concept and ensure technical reliability for the full-scale experiment, a dedicated prototype was designed, constructed, and operated. This work presents an overview of the design, construction, and operational performance of the prototype, with emphasis on its major subsystems, including the TPC, cryogenic and xenon purification systems, slow control, and data acquisition. During operation, the detector demonstrated the capability to achieve a sub-keV energy threshold required for the RELICS physics program, as reflected by a measured single electron gain of 34.30~$\pm$~0.01~(stat.)~PE/e$^-$ and the successful detection of 0.27~keV L-shell decay events from $^{37}$Ar. In addition, essential data analysis techniques and simulation frameworks were developed and validated, establishing the methodological foundation for future RELICS operations. The successful construction and operation of this prototype confirm the feasibility of the core technologies and provide a crucial experimental basis for the final RELICS detector.

2025-11-25, **Emergent Superfluidity of Hard-Core Excitons in Single-Layer Breathing-Kagome Nb$_3$Te$_x$Cl$_{8-x}$**, Mahtab A. Khan et.al., [2511.20598v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20598v1)

 We develop a microscopic theory of superfluidity for hard-core dark excitons on the triangular lattice by mapping the large-$U$ Bose--Hubbard model to an effective XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Hamiltonian including virtual hopping processes. Within this framework, we identify the superfluid phase that emerges between the two Mott-insulating endpoints at fillings 0 and 1, and derive its mean-field structure via a canted-spin solution. We then construct the corresponding continuum Landau-Ginzburg (LG) functional and analyze phase fluctuations and vortex dynamics. In two dimensions, the superfluid--normal transition is shown to be governed by a Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) mechanism with a stiffness determined by microscopic parameters. Our results provide a unified description connecting lattice-scale exciton dynamics to continuum critical behavior in triangular geometries.

2025-11-25, **Inferring the Impacts of Baryonic Feedback from Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Cross-Correlations**, Alex Laguë et.al., [2511.20595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20595v1)

 The complex processes of baryonic feedback associated with galaxy evolution are still poorly understood, and their impact on the clustering of matter on small scales remains difficult to quantify. While many fitting functions and emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum, their input parameters are not directly observable. However, recent studies using hydrodynamical simulations have identified a promising correlation between the gas content of halos and changes to the matter power spectrum from feedback. Building on these findings, we create the first fully data-driven power spectrum emulator. We utilize the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, a secondary anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, as a tracer of free electrons in and around halos. We train a neural network to learn the mapping between the suppression of the matter power spectrum and the shape of the kSZ power spectrum extracted with a radial velocity template. We train and validate our algorithm using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which encompasses a wide range of feedback models. Our emulator can reconstruct the matter power spectrum at the sub-percent level for scales $k\leq 5\;h/$Mpc and $0.2\leq z \leq 1.25$ directly from the data. Our model is robust and retains percent-level accuracy even for feedback models and cosmological parameter values not seen during training (except in a few extreme cases drastically different from the fiducial model). Due to its robustness, our algorithm offers a new way to identify the sources of suppression in the matter power spectrum, breaking the degeneracies between baryonic feedback and new physics. Finally, we present a forecast for reconstruction of the matter power spectrum combining maps of the microwave background anisotropies from a Simons Observatory-like experiment and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.

2025-11-25, **Magnetic Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Bernal Bilayer Graphene**, Yuncheng Mao et.al., [2511.20498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20498v1)

 Magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and reshape a material's spatial symmetry. Because the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is exquisitely sensitive to symmetry, it offers a natural arena for magnetic-field control. Here, we explore how shift current (SC) and magnetic ballistic current (MBC) evolve and emerge in AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We find that the SC responds only mildly to weak fields, behaving as an almost even function of field strength. In contrast, the MBC is activated directly by TRS breaking and grows linearly with weak fields at selected photon energies. Focusing on AB-bilayer graphene ribbon we investigate the behavior of SC and MBC under both weak and strong vertical fields. We uncover the strikingly opposite roles played by edge states in the SC: under weak fields these highly localized, sublattice- and layer-polarized edge modes are essentially dark, yet under strong fields - when Landau levels dominate - the same edge states swell in spatial extent and become intensely bright contributors to the SC response.

2025-11-25, **Chiral phonons in metal-organic frameworks as quantum sensors for the direct detection of dark matter**, Marek Matas et.al., [2511.20461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20461v1)

 We investigate a new quantum sensor for dark matter direct detection with sub-eV sensitivity, focusing on several candidate materials that potentially host chiral phonons with large magnetic moments that can be directly read out with an external magnetometer. We focus on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as possible candidate materials for single chiral phonon detection due to their noncentrosymmetric structure, tunability, and the ability to host these excitations in stable acoustic bands. We identify several promising candidates and compare their projected dark matter detection sensitivity for all possible interactions identified within effective field theory. We establish that the expected sensitivity does not depend heavily on the specific choice of the MOF, enabling us to tailor the final material composition to facilitate the magnetic readout. We then propose a prototype setup able to test the direct readout of a chiral phonon sensor with a surface-integrated magnetometer.

2025-11-25, **$B^+\to K^+ ν\barν$ Excess and DM semi-annihilation**, Jongkuk Kim et.al., [2511.20430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20430v1)

 In 2023, Belle II collaboration announced the observarion of the $B^+ \to K^+ ν\barν$ decay channel for the first time. This decay channel provides a clean signal with high precision in theoretical calculation. However, we encounter $2.8σ$ deviation from the Standard Model (SM) prediction. To resolve this excess, we study scalar dark matter (DM) model with local discrete $Z\_3$ symmetry. Assuming dark $U(1)\_X \equiv U(1)\_{L\_μ- L\_τ}$ symmetry, this $U(1)\_{L\_μ- L\_τ}$ symmetry is spontaneously broken into local discrete $Z\_3$ by non-zero vacuum expectation value of dark Higgs boson. Considering dark Higgs mass is $2$GeV, we can explain the recent ${\rm Br} (B^+ \to K^+ ν\barν)$ excess reported from Belle II collaboration and relic abundance at the same time.

2025-11-25, **Black Hole merger rates in the first billion years in light of JWST data**, P. F. V. Cáceres-Burgos et.al., [2511.20414v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20414v1)

 Context. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discoveries have unveiled an abundance of faint and massive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts (z=4-9), that surpass by 10 to 100 times the extrapolated bolometric (Bol) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LF) from previous AGN campaigns. The two main models that are put forward to explain these observations correspond to light seeds (150 Msol) accreting in episodes of super Eddington, and heavy seeds ($10^3$ - $10^5$ Msol) growing at the Eddington limit. Future gravitational observatories like the Laser Interferometer Satellite Antenna (LISA) will help disentangle these models by reporting the BH-BH merger events from mid to high redshifts. Aims. This work aims to report the predicted merger rates in the heavy seed scenario in light of recent JWST data. In our models we explore (i) instantaneous merging between BHs, (ii) delayed merging after a dynamical timescale, as well as extreme spin configurations (a=0.99, a=-0.99) to bracket BH mass growth. Methods. We use Delphi, a semi-analytical model that tracks baryonic physics over a hierarchical evolution of dark matter halos through cosmic time within the first billion years of the Universe. We calibrate this model for it to simultaneously reproduce galaxy and JWST-AGNs observables. Results. We show reasonable agreement with the Bolometric Luminosity function at z=6, where BHs must accrete 10-100 times more gas than in previous works calibrated to pre-JWST data. However, we underpredict (overpredict) the bright end $10^45.5$ erg s$^-1$ (all luminosity range) at z=7 (z=5) by 1-3.2 dex (0.22-1.6 dex). Regarding BH-BH merger events, the instantaneous (delayed) models predict a total of 28.06 (19.61) yr$^-1$ for BHs at z>=5, which is within the range of merger rates reported in previous literature.

2025-11-25, **Multiscalar-metric gravity: merging gravity, dark energy and dark matter**, Yu. F. Pirogov et.al., [2511.20393v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20393v1)

 The status of a modification of General Relativity (GR) -- Spontaneously Broken Relativity (SBR) -- for merging gravity, dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) is presented. The modification is principally grounded on a multiscalar-metric concept of spacetime endowed with two dynamical structures: a basic metric and a set of the reversible multiscalar fields. The latter ones serve geometrically as exceptional dynamical coordinates among arbitrary kinematical/observer's ones and physically as a kind of gravitational Higgs fields producing possible spontaneous breaking of the symmetry (SSB) of relativity. The effective field theory (EFT) of the extended gravity based on the multiscalar-metric spacetime -- the metagravity -- is discussed and some of its particular realizations beyond GR as SBR are explicated. Physically, SBR results in appearance of massive tensor and scalar gravitons. Some of the emerging consequences, problems and prospects for SBR for future deeper unification of gravity with matter in the context of the relativity and internal symmetries breaking are shortly discussed.

 Hybrid quasiparticles that intertwine magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom underpin emerging strategies for manipulating and transducing quantum information in solids. A key missing element has been the ability to optically access dark excitons - optically forbidden but functionally crucial states that shape energy flow, coherence, and spin dynamics in quantum materials. Here we show that exciton-magnon coupling provides an optical gateway to dark excitons in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor CrSBr. Broadband femtosecond reflectivity reveals a dark exciton at 1.46 eV that is entirely absent in static optical spectra but becomes visible through its coherent hybridization with a GHz magnon. High-photon-energy excitation further allows active control of the hybrid dispersion, enabling strong renormalization and selective enhancement of exciton-magnon interactions. These results establish a general mechanism by which magnetic order renders dark excitons optically addressable, opening a pathway toward engineered hybrid spin-exciton platforms for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction.

 We investigate the origin of the scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation using the \colibre cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. At fixed halo mass, we find a clear positive correlation between stellar mass and halo concentration, particularly in low-mass haloes between $10^{11}$ and $10^{12}\,\rm M\_\odot$, where all halo properties are computed from the corresponding dark-matter-only simulation. Two scenarios have been proposed to explain this trend: the earlier formation of higher-concentration haloes allows more time for star formation, or the deeper gravitational potential wells of higher-concentration haloes enhance baryon retention. To distinguish between them, we examine correlations between halo concentration, stellar mass, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. While, at fixed halo mass, halo concentration correlates with stellar age, stellar age itself shows only a weak correlation with stellar mass, indicating that early formation alone cannot account for the concentration-dependence in the scatter of the SMHM relation. In contrast, both stellar metallicity and halo concentration exhibit correlations with stellar mass. The connection between halo concentration and stellar metallicity persists even when simultaneously controlling for both halo mass and stellar mass. These results support the scenario in which the deeper gravitational potentials in higher-concentration haloes suppress feedback-driven outflows, thereby enhancing both baryon and metal retention.

 The recently released data of DESI DR2 favors a dynamical dark energy theory, with the equation of state crossing the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$. In this paper, we briefly review quintom cosmology, especially the quintom bounce. We will give three examples of a quintom bounce and one example of a cyclic universe with quintom matter.

 We present a search for gravitational waves from inspiraling, planetary-mass ultra-compact binaries using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA. Finding no evidence of such systems, we determine the maximum distance reach for such objects and their merger rate densities, independently of how they could have formed. Then, we identify classes of primordial black-hole mass distributions for which these rate limits can be translated into relevant constraints on the mass distribution of primordial black holes, assuming that they compose all of dark matter, in the mass range $[10^{-6},10^{-3}]M\_\odot$. Our constraints are consistent with existing microlensing results in the planetary-mass range, and provide a complementary probe to sub-solar mass objects.

 We present a novel candidate for cold dark matter consisting of condensed Cooper pairs in a theory of interacting fermions with broken chiral symmetry. Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out that sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and freeze-out instead leaves a residual, long-lived

 On August 17$^{\rm th}$ 2017, observatories worldwide made a landmark detection: gravitational waves and light from a binary neutron star merger. This event revolutionized our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology, and gravitation. In this proceeding of the 2025 International Congress of Basic Science, we describe how it transformed our view of cosmic acceleration (dark energy). The near-simultaneous arrival of light and gravitational waves shows that their speeds agree to within one part in $10^{15}$, excluding large classes of modified gravity theories and interactions between dark energy and matter.

 For dwarf galaxies modeled as deformed Plummer spheres and orbitally moving in ultralight dark matter halo of the Milky Way, the torque induced by the dynamical friction force is determined. The impact of this torque, as well as the torque produced by the gravitational force of the Milky Way, on the internal kinematics of dwarf galaxies is studied. Possible oscillations of dwarf galaxies caused by the tidal torque and misalignment of dwarf galaxies with respect to their equilibrium position are investigated and the corresponding frequencies and periods of oscillations are found.

2025-11-24, **Probing High Reheating Temperatures by Direct Detection Experiments**, Barmak Shams Es Haghi et.al., [2511.19621v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19621v1)

 We argue that the benchmark freeze in dark matter (DM) scenario for direct detection experiments, in which a DM candidate interacts with the Standard Model (SM) through an ultralight dark photon, becomes sensitive to the visible sector reheating temperature if it is sufficiently high. At such temperatures, the irreducible ultraviolet (UV) freeze in production of DM through graviton exchange becomes important and must be combined with the infrared (IR) freeze in yield mediated by the dark photon. As long as gravitationally produced DM does not equilibrate through annihilation into dark photons and the subsequent formation of a dark thermal bath, it retains information about the reheating phase. Including this gravitational contribution relaxes the required DM and SM portal coupling and allows smaller values than those that would match the observed relic abundance through IR freeze in alone. Since current direct detection experiments have excluded the benchmark freeze in model over a wide range of DM masses, they are now effectively probing high reheating temperatures and the gravitational freeze in of DM.

2025-11-24, **ALP-mediated Dark Matter-Nucleon Scattering**, Wim Beenakker et.al., [2511.19619v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19619v1)

 We perform a comprehensive analysis of dark matter-nucleon scattering via the exchange of axion-like particles (ALPs). At first sight, this might appear of little practical use, as non-relativistic scattering through pseudo-scalar interactions is momentum-suppressed and spin-dependent, resulting in scattering rates below any experimental sensitivity. We show that the scattering rate can be drastically enhanced in two ways. First, light ALPs with masses below the typical momentum transfer at direct detection experiments lift the momentum suppression by acting as essentially massless mediators. Second, ALP exchange through loops induces coherent spin-independent scattering. If the ALP has flavor-changing couplings to up-type quarks, loop-induced scattering receives an extra strong enhancement by the top-quark mass. We deduce that, contrary to common lore, XENONnT and PandaX-4T are already sensitive to ALP-mediated dark matter-nucleon scattering. The next generation of direct detection experiments will probe far into the parameter space of the ALP effective theory, potentially exceeding the sensitivity of collider searches.

2025-11-24, **Fibre Inflation Meets Quintessence: Implications of Perturbative Stabilisation**, Dibya Chakraborty et.al., [2511.19610v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19610v1)

 In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $α^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.

2025-11-24, **Connecting clustering and the cosmic web:Observational constraints on secondary halo bias**, Facundo Rodriguez et.al., [2511.19607v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19607v1)

 Cosmological simulations predict significant secondary dependencies of halo clustering on internal properties and environment. Detecting these subtle signals in observational data remains challenging, with important ramifications for galaxy evolution and cosmology. We probe secondary halo bias in observational survey data, using galaxy groups as dark matter halo proxies. We quantify secondary bias using central galaxy colour and environmental diagnostics. We use an extended, refined galaxy group catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Secondary bias is defined as any deviation in group clustering strength at fixed mass, quantified through the projected two-point correlation function. Our environmental analysis uses DisPerSE to compute distances to critical points of the density field, incorporating local group overdensity measurements on multiple scales. We robustly detect several forms of secondary bias in the clustering of galaxy groups. At fixed mass, groups hosting red central galaxies are more strongly clustered than those with blue centrals, with $b\_{\rm relative}$ ranging from $\sim 1.2$ for the 15\% reddest centrals to $\sim 0.8$ for the bluest ones. Environmental dependencies based on cosmic-web distances are also present, though significantly weaker and largely mass-independent. The strongest signal arises from local overdensity: groups in the densest 15\% of environments reach $b\_{\rm relative} \sim 1.4$, while those in the least dense regions fall to $b\_{\rm relative} \sim 0.7$. These results establish a clear observational hierarchy for secondary halo bias. The colour of central galaxies correlates with the local group overdensity, which, in turn, correlates with the bias at fixed group mass. Assuming that central galaxy colour traces halo assembly history, this three-stage picture offers a conceptual link between our results and halo assembly bias.

2025-11-24, **Hawking heating of neutron stars by dark matter**, Akash Kumar Saha et.al., [2511.19599v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19599v1)

 Interactions with particle dark matter could brighten old, isolated neutron stars to thermal luminosities detectable at current and next-generation telescopes. We present a novel mechanism for such signals. Non-annihilating (e.g., asymmetric) dark matter capturing in a neutron star could form a small black hole in its core, which could then rapidly evaporate away. If black holes form and evaporate within the cooling timescale of the neutron star, periodic episodes of black hole evaporation could impart a steady-state stellar luminosity, providing a source of heat additional to the kinetic energy of dark matter during capture. Consequently, we obtain sensitivities to dark matter-nucleon cross sections that are stronger than that from dark kinetic heating by a factor of a few for > $10^4$ GeV (> $10^{10}$ GeV) mass of spin-0 (spin-1/2) dark matter.

2025-11-24, **GREA and Dark Energy: A holographic dual**, Juan García-Bellido et.al., [2511.19546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19546v1)

 The nature of the cosmological constant is a mystery. We don't understand its quantum origin but we associate it with the actual acceleration of the universe because it is the simplest description we had until recently of the present cosmological observations. However, this may change with the next generation of experiments. If we can convince ourselves that the cosmic acceleration is not due to a constant, this would open up new fascinating avenues. By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $Λ$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $Λ$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time. Future observations will determine whether our causal horizon is responsible for the present acceleration and whether our universe will end in de Sitter or Minkowski.

2025-11-24, **The Non-universal Pseudo Phase-Space Density Profiles of Symphony Host Halos**, Bocheng Feng et.al., [2511.19250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19250v1)

 Cosmological N-body simulations have long suggested that the pseudo phase-space density (PPSD), $ρ/σ^3$, of cold dark matter halos follows the universal relation $ρ/σ^3 \propto r^χ$, with $χ\approx -1.875$, as predicted by spherical secondary-infall similarity solutions. This power law appears to hold despite the fact that neither the density $ρ(r)$ nor velocity dispersion $σ(r)$ follow universal power law relations individually, even at fixed mass. We analyze 246 host halos from the Symphony suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations, to consistently measure PPSD profiles across host masses from $10^{11}$ to $10^{15} M\_\odot$. We find that the PPSD systematically deviates from a power law, and that halos with larger deviations from Jeans equilibrium systematically develop steeper average PPSD slopes. This result suggests that the PPSD is not universal; instead, it is linked to a halo's degree of dynamical equilibrium, which is ultimately set by halo formation history. As a result, we show that secondary halo properties such as concentration and accretion rate inherit significant correlations with the PPSD slope. Moreover, our hosts' PPSD profiles are remarkably consistent with predictions from 1D self-similar fluid collapse models, indicating that three-dimensional structure, velocity anisotropy, and cosmological environment all play negligible roles in shaping the PPSD. These findings imply that the PPSD does not follow a universal power law, but is instead determined by halo mass assembly history alone.

2025-11-24, **Improved constraints on ultralight axions using latest observations of the early and late Universe**, Qianshuo Liu et.al., [2511.18917v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18917v1)

 Ultralight axions (ULAs) are hypothetical particles which can behave like dark matter (DM) or dark energy (DE) depending on masses generated at the symmetry-breaking scale. It remains a mystery whether the ULAs can make up a fraction of DM or DE. Although theoretical predictions indicate that the ULAs may leave distinct imprints on cosmological signals, these signatures may exist in a broad spatial and temporal scales, and may be degenerate with the known effects of the standard model. The ULA signatures are extremely subtle and the observational evidence of the ULAs remain elusive. In this work, we infer the ULA properties using both the early and late universe observations from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We validate modeling of the ULA effects using the CMB and BAO mock data and perform different tests to cross-check the results. By analyzing the Planck 2018 CMB measurements and the BAO measurements from the Data Release 2 of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we constrain the energy density fraction ratio of the ULAs to total dark matter $Ω\_a/Ω\_d$ and obtain a new upper bound of $Ω\_a/Ω\_d$. Future CMB and BAO measurements will achieve unprecedented precision and will be crucial for understanding the nature of the ULAs.

 The neutron portal operator provides a theoretically motivated connection between the visible and dark sectors and features in several well-studied asymmetric dark matter models. This operator leads to dark matter induced nucleon decays that mimic the experimental signature of "ordinary" nucleon decays. In this work, we reinterpret Super-Kamiokande nucleon decay searches for $n \rightarrow π^0 ν$ and $p \rightarrow π^+ ν$ to constrain dark matter induced nucleon decays. For GeV-scale dark matter, we obtain lower bounds of $\mathcal{O}(1~\rm{TeV})$ on the scale of the effective neutron portal operator. We also discuss the prospects for future searches at Hyper-Kamiokande and highlight the importance of a dedicated experimental analysis with reduced systematic uncertainties.

 We investigate the origin of unidentified, extended TeV source 1LHAASO J0500$+$4454, considering three possible origins: cosmic rays interacting with a molecular cloud (MC), particles accelerated in a currently undetected supernova remnant (SNR), and an energetic outflow powered by a pulsar. Upper limits on the CO and X-ray emission from the $γ$-ray emitting region disfavor the MC and SNR scenarios, respectively. If a nebula of inverse Compton scattering $e^{\pm}$ powers 1LHAASO J0500$+$4454, then SED modeling indicates that the current particle energy in the nebula is $\sim 4 \times 10^{48}$ erg. If the coincident magnetar SGR 0501$+$4516's rotational energy powered 1LHAASO J0500$+$4454, then a conservative energy budget calculation requires an initial magnetar spin period $P\_{0} \lesssim 5$ ms and a spin-down timescale $τ\_{\rm sd} \lesssim 30$ yr, which has implications for the origins of magnetars.

2025-11-25, **The origin of B-type runaway stars based on kinematics**, Yanjun Guo et.al., [2511.20566v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20566v1)

 Runaway stars depart their birthplaces with high peculiar velocities. Two mechanisms are commonly invoked to explain their origin, the binary supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical ejection scenario (DES). Investigating the kinematic properties of runaway stars is key to understanding their origins.We intend to investigate the origins of 39 B-type runaway stars from LAMOST using orbital traceback analysis. From the catalog of LAMOST, we selected 39 B-type runaway stars and determined their spectral subtypes from key absorption lines. We then derived atmospheric parameters for each star using the Stellar Label Machine (SLAM), which is trained on TLUSTY synthetic spectra computed under the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) assumption. Using the derived atmospheric parameters as input, we estimated stellar masses and ages with a machine learning model trained on PARSEC evolutionary tracks. We finally performed orbital traceback with GALPY to analyze their origins. Through orbital traceback, we find that 29 stars have trajectories entirely within the Galactic disk, whereas 10 are disk-passing yet still trace back to the disk. Two stars have trajectories that intersect those of known clusters. Their orbits show similar morphologies in both the $X-Y$ and $R-Z$ planes, and their [M/H] values are comparable, suggesting possible cluster origins. However, definitive confirmation will require additional evidence. In addition, the $V\_{\rm Sp} - v\sin{i}$ plane shows that runaway stars with low peculiar space velocities but high $v\sin{i}$ remain on the Galactic disk, whereas those with high peculiar space velocities but low $v\sin{i}$ pass through the disk, possibly reflecting two distinct origins.

2025-11-25, **H II regions and supernova remnants associated with molecular clouds: A pilot study with the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey**, Moses O. Langa et.al., [2511.20542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20542v1)

 Massive stars (mass beyond 8 solMass) release vast amounts of energy into the interstellar medium through their stellar winds, photoionising radiation and supernova explosions. These processes may compress nearby regions, triggering further star formation, but the significance of triggered star formation across the Galactic disc is not well understood. This pilot study combines 1.3 GHz continuum data from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) with 13CO (2-1) data from the Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium (SEDIGISM) survey to identify and examine molecular clouds associated with H II regions and supernovae remnants (SNRs). We focus on their physical properties and massive star formation potential. We identify 268 molecular clouds from the SEDIGISM tile covering the Galactic plane region between 341 and 343 longitude deg and latitude deg equal to or less 0.5, of which 90 clouds (34 per cent) are associated with SMGPS extended sources. Compared to unassociated clouds, we find that associated clouds exhibit significantly higher mean mass (9600 solMass vs. 2500 solMass ) and average gas surface density (104 solMass / pc^2 vs. 67 solMass / pc^2 ), and slightly elevated but comparable virial parameters. We also find that the size-linewidth scaling relation is steeper for associated clouds compared to unassociated clouds. In addition, radio luminosity shows a positive correlation with total complex mass, and the ratio L\_radio/L\_complex increases with source size, consistent with an evolutionary sequence where expanding H II regions progressively disrupt their natal molecular environment. These findings suggest an enhanced dynamical activity for the associated clouds and support the hypothesis that feedback from massive stars influences molecular cloud properties and may trigger star formation.

2025-11-25, **Projection Effects in Barred Galaxies Causing Wrong Interpretation of Radial Flows**, E. Salibur et.al., [2511.20267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20267v1)

 Galaxy disks in rotation are sometimes the site of radial flows, especially in their gas component. It is important to estimate the outflows, due to AGN or supernovae feedback, or inflows due to bar gravity torques. However, these radial flows may be confused with non-circular motions, which are quite frequent in the center of galaxy disks. We use a simulated giant, barred spiral galaxy from the GalMer database to study the non-circular motions induced by the bar. Our goal is to identify the spurious radial flows that kinematics modeling algorithms can detect, assuming circular orbits for the gas. Using mock data of a strongly barred galaxy, we quantify the radial velocities computed by the 3D-Barolo algorithm for different disk inclinations and several bar orientations in the plane of the sky: along the major and minor kinematic axes and at 45° from them. Our results show that projection effects cause kinematics modeling algorithms to confuse the radial component of velocity due to elliptical orbits with significant radial flows with mean values up to 84 km.s$^{-1}$, within the bar region. The computed rotation curve is also wrongly estimated inside the bar region, by as much as 150 km.s$^{-1}$ for the highest inclination.

 We present a spatially resolved high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the supernova remnant DEM L71 using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) aboard XMM-Newton. Because of the large dispersion angle of the RGS, we are able to resolve individual emission lines and examine their spatial distributions within this moderately extended remnant. We derive line fluxes across different regions of DEM L71 and perform quantitative plasma diagnostics. Our analysis reveals that some regions have high forbidden-to-resonance ratios of O\emissiontype{VII} He$α$ lines, suggesting a non-negligible contribution from additional physical processes, such as charge exchange and/or resonance scattering. Our results demonstrate that the RGS has potential to serve as an outstanding X-ray imaging spectrometer for moderately diffuse objects.

2025-11-25, **Symbiotic Stars (Including T Corona Borealis) Are Not Immediate Progenitors of Normal Type Ia Supernovae**, Bradley E. Schaefer et.al., [2511.19948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19948v1)

 A popular solution to the Type Ia supernova (SNIa) progenitor problem is that the immediate progenitors are symbiotic star systems. This solution requires that the companion star of the exploding white dwarf must be a red giant star with a heavy stellar wind. This has been tested for 189 normal SNIa, with all tested systems being proven to not have the required red giant: (A) Zero-out-of-9 normal type Ia supernova remnants have any red giant ex-companion star near the center with limits of $M\_V$$>$0.0. (B) Zero-out-of-2 normal SNIa in nearby galaxies have any red giant at the position as seen in archival pre-eruption images by HST to limits of $M\_V$$>$0.0. (C and D) Zero-out-of-111 normal SNIa have any detected hydrogen or helium emission lines in their eruption spectra, with limits on entrained gas of $M\_{\rm H}$$<$0.22 and $M\_{\rm He}$$<$0.07 M$\_{\odot}$, which is the minimum mass lost by a red giant in a nearby blastwave. (E and F) Zero-out-of-9 nearby normal SNIa were detected in the radio or X-rays, as required from the ejecta/wind impact, to limits of $\dot{M}\_{\rm wind}$$<$3$\times$$10^{-9}$ M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. (G) Zero-out-of-$\sim$69 normal SNIa display any brightening in the first few days to limits of $M\_V$$>$$-$18, as required for a red giant companion when we are looking down its shadowcone. With zero-out-of-189 normal SNIa having any possibility of having a red giant companion, the fraction of SNIa with symbiotic progenitors is $<$0.53%. The overwhelming conclusion is that normal SNIa are not from symbiotic-progenitors in any measurable fraction.

 We present a study of the ionized gas kinematics and feedback properties in a sample of 14 low-mass, UV-luminous Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs) at redshifts z~0.1-0.3. These compact, strongly star-forming galaxies serve as local analogs of high-redshift starbursts. Using high-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectra, we model the optical emission-line profiles, including [O III] 4959,5007 and the Balmer lines, with multi-component Gaussian fits. All galaxies show complex kinematics that require both narrow (sigma < 90 km/s) and broad (sigma > 90 km/s) components. The narrow components trace highly turbulent gas associated with massive star-forming regions, while the broad components indicate ionized outflows driven by stellar winds and supernova feedback, with outflow velocities of about 200-500 km/s. Estimated mass outflow rates range from 0.20 to 2.72 solar masses per year, with mass-loading factors between 0.03 and 0.81. We find a mild increase in mass loading toward lower stellar masses, as well as a strong correlation between mass loading and star-formation-rate surface density, suggesting that more compact starbursts drive more powerful outflows. These trends are consistent with those seen in star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts. Our results highlight the importance of local UV-compact starbursts for understanding feedback processes in low-mass, rapidly star-forming galaxies.

 Supernova (SN) feedback-driven galactic outflows are a key physical process that contributes to the baryon cycle by regulating the star formation activity, reducing the amount of metals in low-mass galaxies and enriching the circumgalactic (CGM) and intergalactic media (IGM). We aim to understand the chemical loop of sub-Milky Way (MW) galaxies and their nearby regions. We studied 15 simulated central sub-MW galaxies (M* <= 10^10 Msun) and intermediate-mass galaxies (M* \sim 10^10 Msun) from the CIELO-P7 high-resolution simulations. We followed the evolution of the progenitor galaxies, their properties and the characteristics of the outflows within the redshift range z = [0, 7]. We used two dynamically-motivated outflow definitions, unbound outflows and expelled mass rates, to quantify the impact of SN feedback. At z \sim 0, sub-MW galaxies have a larger fraction of their current oxygen mass in the gas phase but have expelled a greater portion beyond the virial radius, compared to their higher-mass counterparts. Galaxies with M* <\sim 10^9 Msun have 10-40 per cent of their total oxygen mass within R200 in the CGM, and an equivalent to 10-60 per cent expelled into the IGM. In contrast, more massive galaxies have most of the oxygen mass locked by the stellar populations. The CGM of low-mass galaxies predominantly contains oxygen low-temperature gas, acting as a metal reservoir. We find that the outflows are more oxygen-rich for sub-MW galaxies, Zout/ZISM \sim 1.5, than for higher-mass galaxies, Zout/ZISM <= 0.5, particularly for z < 2.

 Model-independent approaches have gained increasing attention as powerful tools to investigate persistent tensions between cosmological observations and the predictions of $Λ$CDM. Notably, recent DESY5 Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data challenge the validity of the cosmological constant, and they remain in tension with SH0ES local distance ladder measurements under standard pre-recombination physics. Building on our previous work, MNRAS 523 (2023) 3, 3406-3422, we present a follow-up analysis of the model-independent calibration of the local and inverse distance ladders using cosmic chronometers (CCH) data and Gaussian Processes. We jointly constrain the SNIa absolute magnitude, $M$, the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, $r\_d$, and the spatial curvature parameter, $Ω\_k$, using CCH with DESY5 and DESI DR1/DR2. We find this data combination compatible with a flat universe at $\sim1.7σ$, with $Ω\_k=-0.143\pm0.085$, showing weaker compatibility than with Pantheon+, while the ladder calibrators read $M=-19.324\_{-0.095}^{+0.092}$ and $r\_d=(144.00^{+5.38}\_{-4.88}$) Mpc. Although current uncertainties limit the precision of our constraints and prevent us from arbitrating the Hubble tension, it is nevertheless instructive to explore the constraining power of our methodology with future SNIa, CCH, and BAO from surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and DESI. We present the first forecast analysis for the triad $(M,Ω\_k,r\_d)$, finding that, in an optimistic scenario, upcoming data will improve agnostic constraints on $M$ by $\sim$54% and on $r\_d$ by $\sim$66%, enabling a $\sim2$% determination of $H\_0$. Precision on $Ω\_k$ will increase by $\sim50$%. Our analysis outlines which improvements in future data - whether in quality, quantity, or redshift coverage - are likely to most effectively tighten these constraints.[abridged]

2025-11-24, **Lost and Found - A gallery of overlooked optical nuclear transients from the ZTF archive**, E. Quintin et.al., [2511.19016v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19016v1)

 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) correspond to the destruction of a star by the tidal forces around a black hole, leading to outbursts which can last from months to years. These transients are rare, and increasing the current sample is paramount to understand them. As part of the Fink alert broker, we have developed an early detection system for TDEs for the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data. In this paper, we report on the optical transients we found either during the development of this tool, or when applying the classifier to the existing archive. We use this sample to anticipate what improvements to the TDE detection systems will need to be implemented for future surveys. For all the transients, we present optical and infrared archival photometry from ZTF, WISE, and Catalina, and assess the previous nuclear activity of the host. We fit the ZTF lightcurves with both a phenomenological and a physically-motivated model. We report on a total of 19 optical nuclear transients, out of which nine are in passive galaxies, eight in active galaxies, and two for which the activity of the host is uncertain. Two transients are newly discovered repeated TDE candidates, and we compare them to the current sample of repeated optical nuclear transients. One transient is exceptionally long-lived (over 5 years), in an until-now passive galaxy. Three of the TDE-like flares in active galaxies have absolute g-band magnitudes brighter than -24, making them new Extreme Nuclear Transient (ENT) candidates. One seemingly repeated object was revealed to be two independent supernovae in the same galaxy. This sample shows both the potential of our detection system for future discovery, and the relevance of archival searches to reveal overlooked transients. It also raises several points of concern and avenues of improvement for current and future classifiers.

 We consider an $f(Q, T)$ gravity theory with a Schrödinger type vectorial non-metricity. In the presence of such a non-metricity, the length of vectors is preserved under autoparallel transport. We obtain the field equations assuming a vanishing total scalar curvature, implemented by a Lagrange multiplier, and investigate their cosmological implications. To do this, we derive the generalized Friedmann equations which now have terms involving the non-metricity and the Lagrange multiplier. Then, we consider two distinct cosmological applications of the model. First of all, by adopting distinct forms of these two basic variables and investigate the possibility of the existence of warm inflationary scenarios within the framework of these models. In particular, we consider the case that the non-metricity is described by a constant vector, and we show that with this assumption we recover standard general relativity. The scenario in which the Lagrange multiplier is a constant is also investigated, and we show that radiation can be created during the very early phases of expansion. The amount of radiation peaks at a certain time after which, there is a transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one. Moreover, we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the considered Schrödinger type cosmology with a set of observational data for the Hubble function, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, by adopting a simple linear form for the Lagrange density. The model predictions are also compared with the results of the $Λ$CDM standard paradigm. Our results indicate that the Schrödinger $f(Q,T)$ type theory can give a good description of the observational data for both the very early and the late Universe.

2025-11-24, **Fast Radio Bursts from White Dwarf Binary Mergers: Isolated and Triple-Induced Channels**, Cheyanne Shariat et.al., [2511.18678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18678v1)

 The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in both young and old stellar populations suggests multiple formation pathways, beyond just young magnetars from core-collapse supernovae. A promising delayed channel involves the formation of FRB-emitting neutron stars through merger- or accretion-induced collapse of a massive white dwarf (WD). By simulating a realistic stellar population with both binaries and triples, we identify pathways to WD collapse that could produce FRB candidates. We find that (i) triple dynamics open new merger channels inaccessible to isolated binaries, significantly enhancing the overall merger rate; (ii) triple-induced mergers broaden the delay-time distribution, producing long-delay ($\gtrsim1$-8~Gyr) events largely independent of metallicity, alongside a shorter-delay population ($\lesssim100$~Myr) of rapid mergers; (iii) these long delays naturally yield FRBs in older environments such as quiescent host galaxies and galactic halos; (iv) when convolved with the cosmic star-formation history, binary channels track the star-formation rate ($z\_{\rm peak} \sim 2$), while triple channels peak later ($z\_{\rm peak} \sim 1$), giving a combined local source rate of $R\_0 \approx 2\times10^4~{\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, consistent with observations; and (v) applying the same framework to Type~Ia supernovae, we find that triples extend the delay-time tail and roughly double the Ia efficiency relative to binaries, yielding rates and redshift evolution in good agreement with observations. If FRBs originate from the collapse of WDs, our results establish triples, alongside binaries, as a crucial and previously overlooked formation pathway whose predicted rates, host demographics, and redshift evolution offer clear tests for upcoming surveys.
