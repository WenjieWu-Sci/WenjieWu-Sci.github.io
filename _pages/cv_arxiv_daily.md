2024-10-17, **Reply to Comment on "Neutrino oscillations originate from virtual excitation of Z bosons" and "Neutrinos produced from $β$ decays of neutrons cannot be in coherent superpositions of different mass eigenstates"**, Shi-Biao Zheng et.al., [2410.13475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13475v1)

 In this reply, I point out that the comment by Cline (arXiv:2410.05826) on my manuscripts (arXiv:2407.00954 and arXiv:2410.03133) has overlooked the critical fact that the quantum entanglement between the neutrino's mass and other degrees of freedom would destroy the quantum coherence between the mass eigenstates.

2024-10-17, **Learning Efficient Representations of Neutrino Telescope Events**, Felix J. Yu et.al., [2410.13148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13148v1)

 Neutrino telescopes detect rare interactions of particles produced in some of the most extreme environments in the Universe. This is accomplished by instrumenting a cubic-kilometer volume of naturally occurring transparent medium with light sensors. Given their substantial size and the high frequency of background interactions, these telescopes amass an enormous quantity of large variance, high-dimensional data. These attributes create substantial challenges for analyzing and reconstructing interactions, particularly when utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called om2vec, that employs transformer-based variational autoencoders to efficiently represent neutrino telescope events by learning compact and descriptive latent representations. We demonstrate that these latent representations offer enhanced flexibility and improved computational efficiency, thereby facilitating downstream tasks in data analysis.

2024-10-17, **Machine-Learning Analysis of Radiative Decays to Dark Matter at the LHC**, Ernesto Arganda et.al., [2410.13799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13799v1)

 The search for weakly interacting matter particles (WIMPs) is one of the main objectives of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). In this work we use Machine Learning (ML) techniques to explore WIMP radiative decays into a Dark Matter (DM) candidate in a supersymmetric framework. The minimal supersymmetric WIMP sector includes the lightest neutralino that can provide the observed DM relic density through its co-annihilation with the second lightest neutralino and lightest chargino. Moreover, the direct DM detection cross section rates fulfill current experimental bounds and provide discovery targets for the same region of model parameters in which the radiative decay of the second lightest neutralino into a photon and the lightest neutralino is enhanced. This strongly motivates the search for radiatively decaying neutralinos which, however, suffers from strong backgrounds. We investigate the LHC reach in the search for these radiatively decaying particles by means of cut-based and ML methods and estimate its discovery potential in this well-motivated, new physics scenario.

2024-10-17, **Signal partitioning in superfluid ${}^4$He: a Monte Carlo approach**, Francesco Toschi et.al., [2410.13684v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13684v1)

 Superfluid ${}^4$He is an ideal candidate for the direct detection of light dark matter via nuclear recoils thanks to its low nuclear mass and the possibility to reach a low detection energy threshold by exploiting the generated quasiparticles. The design of future detectors based on this target, such as the DELight experiment, requires a proper understanding of the formation and partitioning of the signal for different energy depositions from various sources. This work presents an overview of the physical processes involved in the energy deposition of recoiling electrons and ions, and describes a Monte Carlo approach to the partitioning of the signal into different channels. Despite an overall good agreement with existing literature, differences in the region of interest for light dark matter searches below 200\,eV are observed.

2024-10-17, **Neutralino dark matter in the extension of MSSM with two triplets and singlet**, Zhong-Jun Yang et.al., [2410.13659v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13659v1)

 In an extension of MSSM with two triplets and a singlet, called the TNMSSM, there are seven neutralinos which can enrich the study of cold dark matter if one expects that the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is responsible for the observation of Planck satellite. Such a model, compared to the MSSM, can naturally offer a solution to the $\mu$ problem, and its lightest neutralino, which is bino-like, can also provide a correct relic density by using the coannihilation mechanism due to the newly added triplinos. Taking into account the related experimental measurements, such as the bound on the SM-like Higgs mass, the $B$ meson rare decays, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a\_\mu$, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements and the latest dark matter direct detection experiment LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), the TNMSSM parameter space can be strictly limited. In respect to all the constraints mentioned above, we find that a bino-like neutralino with a mass in the region $[100, 450]~\rm{GeV}$ can successfully account for the correct dark matter relic density. Additionally, most of the viable parameter space can be tested in the near future experiments such as the Xenon-nT experiment or LHC.

2024-10-17, **Problems of dark atom cosmology**, V. A. Beylin et.al., [2410.13424v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13424v1)

 The dark atoms $XHe$ are the composite Thomson like atomic dark matter candidates. We address two cosmological problems of this model. The excess of new superheavy particles with even negative charge $X^{-2n}$ over the corresponding antiparticles is balanced by sphaleron transitions with baryon asymmetry and the mass range of $X$ particles should be specified at which this excess can provide dominance of dark atoms in the dark matter density. The other problem is possible capture of light nuclei by dark atoms, which can lead to formation of anomalous isotopes. The possibility of formation of multi dark atom systems at the nucleosynthesis stage is also studied. We approach these open questions of dark atom cosmology in the present work.

2024-10-17, **lightcurver: A Python Pipeline for Precise Photometry of Multiple-Epoch Wide-Field Images**, Frédéric Dux et.al., [2410.13625v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13625v1)

 lightcurver is a photometric pipeline for time series astronomical imaging data, designed for the semi-automatic extraction of precise light curves from small, blended targets. Such targets include, but are not limited to, lensed quasars, supernovae, or Cepheids in crowded fields. lightcurver leverages STARRED (Michalewicz et al., 2023; Millon et al., 2024) to generate state-of-the-art empirical point spread function (PSF) models for each image. It then determines the relative zeropoints between epochs by combining the PSF-photometry fluxes of several stars in the field of view. Subsequently, STARRED is used again to simultaneously model the calibrated pixels of the region of interest across all epochs. This process yields light curves of the point sources and a high-resolution image model of the region of interest, cumulating the signal from all epochs. lightcurver aims to be maintainable, fast, and incremental in its processing approach. As such, it can enable the daily photometric analysis of a large number of blended targets in the context of the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

2024-10-17, **Exploring the supernova remnant contribution to the first LHAASO source catalog via passively illuminated interstellar clouds**, A. M. W. Mitchell et.al., [2410.13484v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13484v1)

 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are considered as the most promising source class to account for the bulk of the Galactic cosmic-ray flux. Yet amongst the population of ultra-high energy (UHE) sources that has recently emerged, due to high-altitude particle detector experiments such as LHAASO and HAWC, remarkably few are associated with known SNRs. These observations might well indicate that the highest energy particles would escape the remnant early during the shock evolution as a result of its reduced confinement capabilities. This flux of escaping particles may then encounter dense targets (gas and dust) for hadronic interactions in the form of both atomic and molecular material such as interstellar clouds, thereby generating a UHE gamma-ray flux. We explore such a scenario here, considering known SNRs in a physically driven model for particle escape, and as coupled to molecular clouds in the Galaxy. Our analysis allows the investigation of SNR-illuminated clouds in coincidence with sources detected in the first LHAASO catalogue. Indeed, the illuminated interstellar clouds may contribute to the total gamma-ray flux from several unidentified sources, as we discuss here. Yet we nevertheless find that further detailed studies will be necessary to verify or refute this scenario of passive UHE gamma-ray sources in future.
