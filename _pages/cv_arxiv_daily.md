2025-07-15, **Measured Lepton Magnetic Moments**, Gerald Gabrielse et.al., [2507.11268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11268v1)

 The electron and muon magnetic moment have played, and continue to play, important roles in testing the fundamental mathematical description of physical reality called the Standard Model of particle physics (SM). The electron magnetic moment is the most precisely measured property of an elementary particle and the most precise SM prediction, setting up the most precise confrontation ever between experiment and theory. It enables the most precise test of quantum field theory, and of the fundamental CPT symmetry invariance of the SM with leptons. The stable electron is studied with quantum methods while the electron remains for months in its quantum ground and first excited states. The muon magnetic moment is one of the most precisely measured property of an unstable elementary particle. Although less precise measured than the electron, it provides greater sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model -- a powerful tool for testing the existence of new particles and forces. Because muons decay quickly, they must be studied as they orbit at nearly the speed of light in a large storage ring. The extremely high precision of the electron and muon magnetic moment measurements has driven major advances in theoretical physics, inspiring new techniques in quantum field theory, precision calculations, and lattice gauge theory. Only experimental limits currently exist on the size of the magnetic moments of the tau and neutrino leptons.

2025-07-15, **Do massive neutrino states really exist?**, Danil D. Shelkovkin et.al., [2507.11164v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11164v1)

 In neutrino physics, it is conventional to work with massive states corresponding to defined neutrino masses. However, in weak interaction processes, only flavor states participate, and the propagation can be described by an off-diagonal mass matrix. In this work, we operate directly with the non-diagonal mass matrix and employ a quantum field theory approach to describe neutrino oscillations within the plane-wave approximation, circumventing the use of wave packets. Within this framework, numerical estimates for the amplitude of a local process involving lepton interactions via virtual neutrino exchange yield values of order $10^{-53}$. For macroscopic processes with neutrino exchange, application of the matrix propagator reproduces the standard quantum mechanical neutrino oscillation probability formula while preserving relativistic invariance.

2025-07-15, **Ultra-High-Energy Transient Source Search using IceCube Neutrinos and Pierre Auger Photon Candidates**, Maxwell Nakos et.al., [2507.10994v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10994v1)

 The origins of ultra-high-energy particles remain one of the most profound mysteries in astrophysics. If nearby transient sources of ultra-high-energy particles exist, we might expect correlated emission of neutrinos and photons, arriving in close temporal and spatial coincidence. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the South Pole, is sensitive to neutrinos from TeV to EeV energies, while the Pierre Auger Observatory, in Argentina, detects cosmic rays and has the capability of observing ultra-high-energy photons using surface and fluorescence detectors. The ultra-high-energy photon candidates reported by the Auger Collaboration, though consistent with cosmic ray backgrounds, provide a compelling opportunity to search for correlated neutrino-photon events. In this contribution, we present the framework to search for ultra-high-energy transients by combining multi-flavour neutrino data from IceCube with photon candidates from the Auger Detector from 2011 to 2017. We will report the sensitivities that we expect to achieve from the search and the astrophysical implications of the possible outcomes.

2025-07-15, **Probing Cosmic Neutrino Background through Parametric Fluorescence**, Guo-yuan Huang et.al., [2507.10868v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10868v1)

 We point out that relic neutrinos from the Big Bang may induce the parametric fluorescence in molecular systems, which offers a novel way to discover cosmic neutrino background. By coherently scattering with molecular energy levels, a massive neutrino can spontaneously ``decay" into a lighter neutrino and an infrared signal photon, i.e., $\nu^{}\_{i} + M \to \nu^{}\_{j} + \gamma^{}\_{\rm S} + M$, where the molecular state $M$ remains unchanged after the scattering. Because the amplitudes of different radiants are matched in phase, the rate is coherently enhanced and proportional to the squared density of ambient dipoles. When the energy transfer from neutrinos coincides with the molecular energy-level difference, the fluorescence will be on resonance. We find that the event rate for $\nu^{}\_{i} \to \nu^{}\_{j} + \gamma^{}\_{\rm S}$ at the resonance peak through the magnetic dipole transition can reach $R \sim 5~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ (or $10~{\rm yr}^{-1}$) for Dirac (or Majorana) neutrinos for a nominal target with a spatial dimension of $l=3~{\rm m}$. Parity mixing by the Stark effect may help to further magnify the signal rate.

2025-07-14, **Diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino emission from the Milky Way and the local knee in the cosmic ray spectrum**, C. Prevotat et.al., [2507.10823v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10823v1)

 The LHAASO observatory has recently measured details of the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum in the knee region (1 -- 10 PeV) with unprecedented precision, including its average CR mass composition and the spectrum of the proton component. We use these precision measurements, combined with direct measurements of CRs by space-based detectors, to derive predictions for the spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino emission from the interstellar medium under the assumption that the CR spectrum is universal throughout the Milky Way. We compare these predictions with the Fermi-LAT and LHAASO measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray flux from inner and outer Galactic Plane regions and with estimates of the neutrino flux based on the IceCube data for the same Galactic Plane regions. We notice that the model predictions exceed LHAASO gamma-ray measurements at energies above 100 TeV. This excess can be interpreted within a CR knee model assuming a "local PeV CR bubble''. Within this model, we infer the extension of the local PeV CR bubble of 1.5 +/- 0.3 kpc in the direction of the inner Galaxy and of 0.7+/-0.3 kpc toward the outer Galaxy.

2025-07-14, **Search for Accelerator-Produced Sub-GeV Dark Matter with the NOvA Near Detector**, S. Abubakar et.al., [2507.10754v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10754v1)

 The NuMI facility at Fermilab produces a high-intensity beam of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos, designed to study neutrino oscillations. This beam may also be a source of dark matter particles produced through a light mediator. We search for dark matter particles with masses between 1 and 200 MeV that interact with Standard Model particles via a vector portal, producing forward-scattered single-electron events in the NOvA near detector. We set limits on the dark-visible coupling based on an exposure of 2.55x10^21 protons of 120 GeV energy on the NuMI target. For the dark matter mass range 10-20 MeV, this analysis sets the tightest constraints on the coupling to date.

2025-07-14, **Beyond standard model particles in the atmospheric flux: a long-lived stau example**, Atri Bhattacharya et.al., [2507.10745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10745v1)

 We discuss fluxes of long-lived supersymmetric (SUSY) particles produced in the atmosphere from ultra-high energy cosmic-ray interactions with air nuclei. We consider long-lived particle production which proceeds first via the on-shell formation of heavier particles in the SUSY spectrum and then their decays. Specifically, we focus on the production of stau pairs from the decays of squarks produced in the initial cosmic ray-air collision under the purview of gauge-mediated symmetry breaking models that have the stau as the next-to-lightest SUSY particle. The calculation of the resulting stau flux schematically mirrors that of prompt atmospheric neutrino production, however, with the energy scale of initial hadronic collision set to EeV energy scales of the incident cosmic rays rather than the PeV energies where the prompt atmospheric neutrino fluxes dominate over neutrino fluxes from pions and kaons, and with the appropriate stau production cross section. We show the effect of accounting for the energy distribution of the staus relative to the squark energy distributions. We discuss the potential for future ultra-high energy detectors similar in scope to IceCube-Gen2 to detect atmospheric staus via tracks going through the detector volume. Current collider constraints on stau pair production within the SUSY framework considered here are more constraining than those from a detector like IceCube-Gen2 over ten years.

2025-07-14, **Tracing Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions through Charged Lepton Collisions**, Sudip Jana et.al., [2507.10703v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10703v1)

 Neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) play a crucial role in neutrino oscillations and can provide valuable insights for constructing models of neutrino masses and mixing. While NSI have been widely explored through oscillation and scattering experiments, as well as in cosmological and astrophysical contexts, we focus on probing them at future lepton colliders like the ILC, CLIC, and FCC-$ee$. If NSI arise from heavy mediators above the electroweak scale, these colliders can offer superior sensitivity compared to neutrino experiments across a broad mass range. A notable outcome is that lepton collider data can help resolve parameter degeneracies seen in oscillation studies. We find that large NSI scenarios, proposed to address the tension between T2K and NO$\nu$A results, can be completely tested at such collider facilities. We also explore the potential of future colliders like the FCC to probe leptonic NSI using lepton PDFs in proton-proton collisions.

2025-07-14, **Updated Bounds on the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model from LHC Dilepton Resonance Searches**, Gabriela Lichtenstein et.al., [2507.10684v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10684v1)

 The Left-Right model is a popular extension of the Standard Model that features three new neutral gauge bosons, $W^{\pm}\_R$ and $Z\_R$. Collider searches for a Left-Right symmetry are often concentrated on the charged right-handed current, but in this work, we take advantage of the dilepton data at the LHC with center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and 139 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity to place lower mass bounds in the $Z\_R$ mass based on the $p\,p \rightarrow Z\_{R} \rightarrow \ell^{+} \, \ell^{-}$ process. We vary the $SU(2)\_R$ gauge coupling from $g\_{R}=0.4$ to $g\_{R}=1.0$, and impose $M\_{Z\_R}>4.9$ TeV and $M\_{Z\_{R}}>6.1$ TeV, respectively. Lastly, we put our findings into perspective with $W\_R$ searches at the LHC and show that our limits cover an unexplored region of parameter space, where the right-handed neutrino is heavier than the $W\_R$ boson.

2025-07-14, **Exploring ultra-high energy neutrino experiments through the lens of the transport equation**, Stefano Palmisano et.al., [2507.10665v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10665v1)

 We develop a first-principles formalism, based on the transport equation in the line-of-sight approximation, to link the expected number of muons at neutrino telescopes to the flux of neutrinos at the Earth surface. We compute the distribution of muons inside Earth, arising from the up-scattering of neutrinos close to the detector, as well as from the decay of taus produced farther away. This framework allows one to account for systematic uncertainties, as well as to clarify the assumptions behind definitions commonly used in literature, such as the effective area. We apply this formalism to analyze the high-energy muon event recorded by KM3NeT, with a reconstructed energy of $ 120^{+110}\_{-60} \, \mathrm{PeV}$ and an elevation angle of $\left(0.54\pm 2.4\right)^\circ$, in comparison with the non-observation of similar events by IceCube. We find a $3.1\,\sigma$ tension between the two experiments, assuming a diffuse neutrino source with a power-law energy dependence. Combining both datasets leads to a preference for a very low number of expected events at KM3NeT, in stark contrast to the observed data. The tension increases both in the case of a diffuse source peaking at the KM3NeT energy and of a steady point source, whereas a transient source may reduce the tension down to $1.6\,\sigma$. The formalism allows to treat potential beyond-the-Standard-Model sources of muons, and we speculate on this possibility to explain the tension.

2025-07-14, **No-group Scotogenic Model**, Takaaki Nomura et.al., [2507.10299v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10299v1)

 In the present work, the scotogenic model is constructed applying non invertible $Z\_M$ symmetries. The stability of dark matter and the scotogenic structure of the neutrino mass matrix is achieved via the new non-group symmetry. The non-group Scotogenic model is given with minimalistic content giving a one-zero structure of the neutrino mass matrix, and numerical analysis of the lepton mixing angles and physics are presented. Other relevant constraints are also studied.

2025-07-14, **Data production and Monte Carlo simulations for the Pierre Auger Observatory**, Paula Gina Isar et.al., [2507.10258v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10258v1)

 The Pierre Auger Observatory consists of 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs) and 27 fluorescence telescopes, covering a surface of 3000 km2 in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. After almost two decades, Auger Phase I has ended the data taking and has already delivered many outstanding physics results. The Auger Observatory is currently running in Phase II, with upgraded detectors for enhanced data of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). During Phase I, several engineering detectors were developed and tested. Some of those developments led to new detectors, which are now part of the upgraded Observatory. For Phase II, the WCDs were upgraded with a surface-scintillator detector, a radio detector, a small photomultiplier, and an upgraded electronics board, facilitating mass-sensitive measurements for source identification of UHECRs. Moreover, an underground muon detector allows for a direct measurement of the muon content of air showers. The Offline framework is the main software for the event reconstruction and detector simulation at the Pierre Auger Observatory. It is continuously being developed to accommodate changes in the detector and new algorithms. It allows the running of various applications, which are made up of individual modules, either on raw data or simulations on an event-by-event basis. Large productions of shower and detector reference libraries are done with CORSIKA 7 and Offline on the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) using the Virtual Organization Auger. Various air-shower geometries (up to 89 degrees in zenith) were considered, as well as several primary particles (from light to ultra-heavy nuclei, photons, and neutrinos), hadronic interaction models and detector configurations for Phase I and Phase II. In this contribution, we present the actual efforts and updates on software for data production and reference Monte Carlo simulations for Auger data analysis.

2025-07-14, **A Cost Effective Optimization of the hybrid-DOM Design for TRIDENT**, Hengbin Shao et.al., [2507.10256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10256v1)

 TRIDENT is a planned multi-cubic-kilometer deep-sea neutrino telescope to be built in the South China Sea, designed to rapidly discover high-energy astrophysical neutrino sources with sensitivity to all neutrino flavors. Achieving this at scale requires a detector design that balances performance with power, cost, and mechanical simplicity. This study presents a cost-effective optimization of TRIDENT's hybrid Digital Optical Module (hDOM) design, comparing configurations using high-quantum-efficiency (QE) 3-inch PMTs and larger 4-inch PMTs, the latter evaluated with both baseline and enhanced QE assumptions. Using full-chain detector simulations incorporating site-specific seawater optical properties and realistic backgrounds, we assess performance in all-flavor neutrino detection efficiency, directional reconstruction, and tau neutrino flavor identification from 1 TeV to 10 PeV. We find that if 4-inch PMTs can achieve QE comparable to 3-inch PMTs, their performance matches or improves upon that of the 3-inch design, while significantly reducing channel count, power consumption, and cost. These findings support the 4-inch PMT hDOM as a promising and scalable choice for TRIDENT's future instrumentation.

2025-07-14, **Search for Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory: New Triggers, Methods, and Constraints**, Srijan Sehgal et.al., [2507.10214v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10214v1)

 The Pierre Auger Observatory has the capability to identify neutrino-induced extensive air showers above $10^{17}$ eV by using its large Surface Detector (SD) array. Data from the Observatory have been used to set some of the most stringent upper limits to the neutrino flux in the ultra-high energy (UHE) range. The data have also been used for follow-up detection of transient events in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics. In mid-2013, two additional SD triggers (Time-over-Threshold-deconvolved (ToTd) and Multiplicity-of-Positive Steps (MoPS)) were shown to increase the detection capability for the neutrino-induced air showers in the energy regime below $10^{19}$ eV by a factor of 5-10. This contribution will give an overview of the ongoing work regarding the searches for UHE neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The impact of the ToTd and MoPS triggers for neutrino search in the zenith angle range of $60^{\circ} < \theta < 75^{\circ}$ is discussed. A novel neutrino identification method, which integrates these triggers, is applied to observational data to look for neutrino-like events using a $\textit{blind}$ search strategy. New constraints to point-like sources of UHE neutrinos will be presented for the angular range explored.

 The central engine of gamma-ray burst is considered. Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is reconsidered under the asymtotic magnetic condition ${\bf B}=B\_0\hat{z}$ (rotation axis) at $r\gg r\_H$. Another scenario of $\nu \overline{\nu} \to e^+ e^-$ driven jet are combined to BZ process to compliment it.

2025-07-15, **Quantum modified inertia: an application to galaxy rotation curves**, Jonathan Gillot et.al., [2507.11524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11524v1)

 This study explores the field of modified inertia through a novel model involving maximal and minimal acceleration bounds. A principle of dynamics is developed within special relativity and has direct implications in astrophysics, especially for galaxy rotation curves. The presence of a minimal acceleration significantly reduces the amount of dark matter required to account for these curves. The model presented here is however conceptually different from fiduciary Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). The modified inertia with the minimal acceleration bound closely matches with many observed galaxy rotation curves and the radial acceleration relation, showing a better agreement than MOND in the $10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ regime. Additionally, the minimal acceleration is predicted to evolve with redshift.

2025-07-15, **From Redshift to Real Space: Combining Linear Theory With Neural Networks**, Edoardo Maragliano et.al., [2507.11462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11462v1)

 Spectroscopic redshift surveys are key tools to trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe and test the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, using redshifts as distance proxies introduces distortions in the 3D galaxy distribution. If uncorrected, these distortions lead to systematic errors in LSS analyses and cosmological parameter estimation. We present a new method that combines linear theory (LT) and a neural network (NN) to mitigate redshift space distortions (RSDs). The hybrid LT+NN approach is trained and validated on dark matter halo fields from z = 1 snapshots of the Quijote N-body simulations. LT corrects large-scale distortions in the linear regime, while the NN learns quasi-linear and small-scale features. The LT correction is applied first, then the NN is trained on the resulting fields to improve accuracy across scales. The method uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and yields significant performance gains: approximately 50% improvement over LT alone and 12% over NN alone. The reconstructed fields from the LT+NN method show stronger correlations with the true real-space fields than either LT or NN separately. The hybrid method also improves clustering statistics such as halo-halo and halo-void correlations, with benefits extending to BAO scales. Compared to NN-only, it provides better suppression of spurious anisotropies on large and quasi-linear scales, as measured by the quadrupole moments of correlation functions. This work shows that combining a physically motivated dynamical model with a machine learning algorithm leverages the strengths of both approaches. The LT+NN method achieves high accuracy with modest training data and computational cost, making it a promising tool for future applications to more realistic galaxy surveys.

2025-07-15, **GeV-scale thermal dark matter from dark photons: tightly constrained, yet allowed**, D. Alonso-González et.al., [2507.11376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11376v1)

 GeV-scale thermal dark matter (DM) is highly constrained by the null results of both direct and indirect detection experiments, especially in the context of simplified models. In this work, we study the interplay of collider, direct and indirect detection constraints on an extension of the dark Abelian Higgs model that includes a Dirac fermionic DM candidate, $\chi$. We take into account in a consistent fashion the dilution of the indirect and direct detection signals when the relic abundance of $\chi$ is smaller than the total observed DM density (assuming that it is a subdominant component in those cases). As a consequence, we show that indirect detection constraints cannot probe regions with large kinetic mixing, and direct detection experiments provide the leading constraints in most of the parameter space. Collider searches for the (invisibly decaying) vector mediator provide complementary bounds in areas with large kinetic mixing. We find that the only way to avoid both indirect and direct detection limits is in narrow windows of parameter space close to $m\_\chi\lesssim m\_{Z\_D}/2$, when $\chi$ is produced resonantly in the early universe, and it can constitute all of the DM. For this to happen, a small dark sector coupling is required: $\alpha\_D~\lesssim10^{-3}$ for DM masses below $6$ GeV, or $\alpha\_D~\lesssim10^{-5}$ for DM masses larger than $10$ GeV. The remaining areas of the parameter space can be probed in a complementary way by future direct detection experiments (which will narrow down the allowed area around the resonant region) and collider searches (which will set limits for smaller values of the kinetic mixing).

2025-07-15, **A highly-compact and ultra-fast homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter based on oriented lead tungstate crystals**, L. Bandiera et.al., [2507.11332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11332v1)

 Progress in high-energy physics has been closely tied to the development of highperformance electromagnetic calorimeters. Recent experiments have demonstrated the possibility to significantly accelerate the development of electromagnetic showers inside scintillating crystals typically used in homogeneous calorimeters based on scintillating crystals when the incident beam is aligned with a crystallographic axis to within a few mrad. In particular, a reduction of the radiation length has been measured when ultrarelativistic electron and photon beams were incident on a high-Z scintillator crystal along one of its main axes. Here, we propose the possibility to exploit this physical effect for the design of a new type of compact e.m. calorimeter, based on oriented ultrafast lead tungstate (PWO-UF) crystals, with a significant reduction in the depth needed to contain electromagnetic showers produced by high-energy particles with respect to the state-of-the-art. We report results from tests of the crystallographic quality of PWO-UF samples via high-resolution X-ray diffraction and photoelastic analysis. We then describe a proof-of-concept calorimeter geometry defined with a Geant4 model including the shower development in oriented crystals. Finally, we discuss the experimental techniques needed for the realization of a matrix of scintillator crystals oriented along a specific crystallographic direction. Since the angular acceptance for e.m. shower acceleration depends little on the particle energy, while the decrease of the shower length remains pronounced at very high energy, an oriented crystal calorimeter will open the way for applications at the maximum energies achievable in current and future experiments. Such applications span from forward calorimeters, to compact beam dumps for the search for light dark matter, to source-pointing space-borne {\gamma}-ray telescopes.

2025-07-15, **Euclid preparation. Overview of Euclid infrared detector performance from ground tests**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2507.11326v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11326v1)

 The paper describes the objectives, design and findings of the pre-launch ground characterisation campaigns of the Euclid infrared detectors. The pixel properties, including baseline, bad pixels, quantum efficiency, inter pixel capacitance, quantum efficiency, dark current, readout noise, conversion gain, response nonlinearity, and image persistence were measured and characterised for each pixel. We describe in detail the test flow definition that allows us to derive the pixel properties and we present the data acquisition and data quality check software implemented for this purpose. We also outline the measurement protocols of all the pixel properties presented and we provide a comprehensive overview of the performance of the Euclid infrared detectors as derived after tuning the operating parameters of the detectors. The main conclusion of this work is that the performance of the infrared detectors Euclid meets the requirements. Pixels classified as non-functioning accounted for less than 0.2% of all science pixels. IPC coupling is minimal and crosstalk between adjacent pixels is less than 1% between adjacent pixels. 95% of the pixels show a QE greater than 80% across the entire spectral range of the Euclid mission. The conversion gain is approximately 0.52 ADU/e-, with a variation less than 1% between channels of the same detector. The reset noise is approximately equal to 23 ADU after reference pixels correction. The readout noise of a single frame is approximately 13 $e^-$ while the signal estimator noise is measured at 7 $e^-$ in photometric mode and 9 $e^-$ in spectroscopic acquisition mode. The deviation from linear response at signal levels up to 80 k$e^-$ is less than 5% for 95% of the pixels. Median persistence amplitudes are less than 0.3% of the signal, though persistence exhibits significant spatial variation and differences between detectors.

2025-07-15, **Synchronization Induced by Ultralight Dark Matter**, Chrisna Setyo Nugroho et.al., [2507.11144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11144v1)

 We study the possibility of ultralight bosonic dark matter (UlDM) to induce a synchronized behaviour on randomly evolving oscillators. We introduce a new interaction between UlDM and the oscillators and further demonstrate the occurence of the phase transition from disordered oscillators state into ordered state. For UlDM within the mass range of $10^{-14}\,\text{eV}/c^{2} \leq m\_{\phi} \leq 1 \,\text{eV}/c^{2}$ as well as the white noise strength lower than 0.01 Hz, the synchronization of randomly distributed oscillators with the mean angular frequency $1$ Hz and the corresponding standard deviation 0.1 Hz occurs when the coupling strength between UlDM and oscillators lies within $10 \geq g\_{\omega} \geq 10^{-13}$. This offers an alternative method to unveil the nature of UlDM with respect to the established experiments.

2025-07-15, **Charged Particle Oscillations around a Black Hole Surrounded by CDM Halos**, Zakaria Ahal et.al., [2507.11139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11139v1)

 HF QPOs are among the most intriguing phenomena observed in LMXBs containing BHs or neutron stars. In this work, we investigate charged particles' dynamics in the nearby of a Schwarzschild-like BH embedded in a uniform magnetic field and surrounded on all sides by CDM. Thereby gaining deeper insight into the influence of magnetic and DM distributions on observable phenomena near compact objects. We first present a modified metric, which incorporates the effects of a CDM ...   We compute the fundamental oscillation frequencies-radial, latitudinal, Keplerian, and Larmor-and demonstrate how their variation depends on the combined influence of CDM and magnetic field strength. The resulting frequency structure allows us to identify resonance radii associated with HF QPOs, particularly those in 3:2 ratios observed in microquasars. We assess several theoretical models for QPO generation, including the (ER), Relativistic Precession (RP), Tidal Disruption (TD), and Warped Disk (WD) models. A comparative fit of observational data from GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, XTE 1550-564, and GRO 1655-40 demonstrate that the TD and WD models provide the best match for HF QPOs in the presence of moderate magnetic flux ($B' = 0.1$), while the other models except ER fit better in weak-field scenarios.   Our results highlight the importance of including both magnetic and dark matter (DM) effects in strong-field astrophysics and support the use of HF QPOs as sensitive probes of BH environments. This study opens new perspectives for exploring particle dynamics, accretion disk structure ...

2025-07-15, **Euclid VI. NISP-P optical ghosts**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2507.11072v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11072v1)

 The Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) onboard Euclid includes several optical elements in its path, which introduce artefacts into the data from non-nominal light paths. To ensure uncontaminated source photometry, these artefacts must be accurately accounted for. This paper focuses on two specific optical features in NISP's photometric data (NISP-P): ghosts caused by the telescope's dichroic beamsplitter, and the bandpass filters within the NISP fore-optics. Both ghost types exhibit a characteristic morphology and are offset from the originating stars. The offsets are well modelled using 2D polynomials, with only stars brighter than approximately 10 magnitudes in each filter producing significant ghost contributions. The masking radii for these ghosts depend on both the source-star brightness and the filter wavelength, ranging from 20 to 40 pixels. We present the final relations and models used in the near-infrared (NIR) data pipeline to mask these ghosts for Euclid's Quick Data Release (Q1).

2025-07-15, **Cutting rules for non-relativistic dark matter in solids based on Kohn-Sham orbitals**, Zheng-Liang Liang et.al., [2507.11033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11033v1)

 The Cutkosky cutting rules establish a direct connection between the imaginary parts of loop amplitudes and physical observables such as decay rates and cross sections, providing heuristic insights into the underlying processes. This work lays a robust theoretical foundation for the application of cutting rules in solid-state systems involving instantaneous dark matter (DM)-electron Yukawa interaction as well as the Coulomb potential. The cutting rules are formulated using the single-electron wavefunctions and corresponding energy eigenvalues obtained from the Kohn-Sham equations within density functional theory (DFT). This framework is not only of considerable theoretical interest but also holds significant practical relevance for studying DM phenomenology in condensed matter systems.

2025-07-15, **The Study of Thermal Fluctuations in Microwave and Mechanical Resonators**, Michael T Hatzon et.al., [2507.10997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10997v1)

 We report high-resolution measurements of thermal fluctuations in microwave and mechanical resonators using a dual-channel readout system. The latter comprises a low-noise amplifier, an I/Q-mixer, and a cross-correlator. We discovered that, under certain conditions, the intrinsic fluctuations of the low-noise amplifier, which are common to both channels of the readout system, are averaged out when computing the voltage noise cross-spectrum between the mixer's outputs. The suppression of the amplifier's technical fluctuations significantly improves the contrast of the thermal noise peaks exhibited by the resonators. Thus, for the room-temperature-stabilized 9 GHz sapphire-loaded cavity resonator, we observed more than 16 dB improvement in the thermal noise peak contrast relative to the single-channel measurements. The ability of the dual-channel readout system to discriminate between the broad- and narrow-band fluctuations may benefit the search for dark matter, which relies on the use of cryogenic microwave resonators.

 Q-ball dark matter is one of candidates for the macroscopic dark matter: Q-ball is a non-topological solitonic configuration, whose stability can be ensured by global charge and energy conservation. One of the crucial factors for discovering signatures from the Q-ball dark matter, is the interactions of the Q-ball dark matter with ordinary matter. In particular, the scattering of ordinary matter off the Q-ball dark matter is important for the direct detection searches, such as paleo-detectors. It was conjectured that quarks incident on the Q-ball were reflected as anti-quarks with a probability of order unity, but it costs the energy of the squark in the Q-ball, which cannot be paid in the scattering of ordinary matter off the Q-ball dark matter. In addition, once a proton is reflected as an anti-proton, the Q-ball obtains the electromagnetic charge. In this study, we revisit the scattering process of quarks with the Q-ball with taking into account the energy cost of the scattering and the electromagnetic charge-up of the Q-ball.

 Under the standard model of hierarchical structure formation, the overall geometry of galaxy clusters is better described by a triaxial ellipse than a sphere. As a result, applying spherically-symmetric models can result in significant biases. These biases can be mitigated by fitting a triaxial model, requiring deep multiprobe data and a set of physically motivated models to describe them. Here we present a multiprobe triaxial analysis methodology based on the data available for galaxy clusters in the Cluster Heritage project with XMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at Endpoint of structure formation (CHEX-MATE), which includes X-ray data from XMM-Newton, SZ data from Planck and ACT, and WL data from Subaru. This work builds on our previous development of a gas-only X-ray and SZ triaxial fitting formalism in Paper I. We apply our approach to the CHEX-MATE cluster PSZ2 G313.33+61.13 (Abell 1689) and find that it is elongated along the line of sight relative to the plane of sky by a factor of $\mathcal{R}\_{LP} = 1.27 \pm 0.02$. As a result, the WL mass obtained from our triaxial fit, $\text{M}\_{200c}=(13.69\_{-1.41}^{+1.56})\times10^{14} \text{M}\_{\odot}$, is significantly lower than the value of $(17.77\_{-1.75}^{+2.00})\times10^{14} \text{M}\_{\odot}$ obtained from a spherically-symmetric fit that otherwise employs the same methodology. Our triaxial fit finds a concentration of $c\_{200c}=8.55\_{-1.61}^{+2.20}$, consistent with the spherically-symmetric value of $9.99\_{-1.78}^{+2.26}$, which suggests that the unexpectedly high concentration in Abell 1689 is not due to triaxiality and orientation. We also measure the non-thermal pressure fraction at radii between 0.18-1.37 Mpc, finding a minimum of approximately 20 per cent at intermediate radii increasing to near 30 per cent at both the smallest and largest radii, and with a typical measurement precision of $\pm$5 per cent.

2025-07-14, **Impact of Cosmic Ray-driven Outflows on Lyman-$α$ Emission in Cosmological Simulations**, Taysun Kimm et.al., [2507.10805v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10805v1)

 Cosmic ray (CR) feedback has been proposed as a powerful mechanism for driving warm gas outflows in galaxies. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the impact of CR feedback on neutral hydrogen (HI) in a $10^{11}\,M\_\odot$ dark matter halo at $2<z<4$. To this end, we post-process the simulations with ionizing radiative transfer and perform Monte Carlo Lyman-$\alpha$ (Lya) transfer calculations. CR feedback reduces HI column densities around young stars, thereby allowing more Lya photons to escape and consequently offering a better match to the Lya luminosities of observed Lya emitters. Although galaxies with CR-driven outflows have more extended HI in the circumgalactic medium, two Lya line properties sensitive to optical depth and gas kinematics - the location of the red peak in velocity space ($v\_\mathrm{red}$) and relative strength of the blue-to-red peaks ($B/R$) - cannot distinguish between the CR-driven and non-CR simulations. This is because Lya photons propagate preferentially along low HI density channels created by the ionizing radiation, thereby limiting the scattering with volume-filling HI. In contrast, the observed low flux ratios between the valley and peak and the surface brightness profiles are better reproduced in the model with CR-driven outflows because the Lya photons interact more before escaping, rather than being destroyed by dust as is the case in the non-CR simulation. We discuss the potential cause of the paucity of sightlines in simulations that exhibit prominent red peaks and large $v\_\mathrm{red}$, which may require the presence of more volume-filling HI.

 Within the hypothesis of the dark-matter origin of the excess in $B\to K M\_X$ decays over the standard-model expectation, observed by Belle-II, we show that: (i) Scalar- and vector-medator scenarios may be unambiguously discriminated by measuring the differential distributions in $B\to K M\_X$ and $B\to K^* M\_X$ decays. (ii) Combining the available data on $\Gamma(B\to K M\_X)$ and the upper limit on $\Gamma(B\to K^* M\_X)$ provides a tight constraint on the vector mediator mass $M\_V\lesssim 3$ GeV. At the same time, no constraints on the scalar-mediator mass are imposed by these data. (iii) Both scalar- and vector-mediator scenarios allow a good description of the differential distributions in $B\to K M\_X$ measured by Belle-II and an extraction of dark-model parameters within both scenarios.

 We build upon FEGA25 (Contini et al 2025), a previously introduced semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution, focusing on its enhanced treatment of supernova and active galactic nucleus feedback mechanisms. In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative (suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation), we introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas beyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a longstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the overestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25 is calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR, YS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions across a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas ejection in halos with logM\_{halo} < approximately 12, while AGN feedback becomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model, which activates primarily at late times, redshift < 1, reproduces a characteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift zero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. Conversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both models preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce the stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3. Our results emphasize that a physically motivated AGN driven mechanism capable of selectively removing hot gas is essential to accurately model the baryon cycle, particularly in intermediate halo mass regimes.

 Observations of the hydrogen hyperfine transition through the 21 cm line near the end of the cosmic dark ages provide unique opportunities to probe new physics. In this work, we investigate the potential of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal to constrain metastable particles produced in the early universe that decay at later times, thereby modifying the thermal and ionization history of the intergalactic medium. The study begins by extending previous analyses of decaying dark matter (DM), incorporating back-reaction effects and tightening photon decay constraints down to DM masses as low as 20.4 eV. The focus then shifts to non-minimal dark sectors with multiple interacting components. The analysis covers two key scenarios: a hybrid setup comprising a stable cold DM component alongside a metastable sub-component, and a two-component dark sector of nearly degenerate states with a metastable heavier partner. A general parameterization based on effective mass spectra and fractional densities allows for a model-independent study. The final part presents two explicit realizations: an axion-like particle coupled to photons, and pseudo-Dirac DM interacting via vector portals or electromagnetic dipoles. These scenarios illustrate how 21 cm cosmology can set leading bounds and probe otherwise inaccessible regions of parameter space.

2025-07-14, **Asymgenesis**, Martin A. Mojahed et.al., [2507.10655v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10655v1)

 We present a framework based on the standard type-I seesaw model that relates the baryon asymmetry of the universe to the dark matter (DM) density. The framework, which we name "Asymgenesis", relies on the presence of primordial charge asymmetries seeded either in the dark sector or in the visible sector. A higher-dimensional portal operator reshuffles this initial asymmetry into both sectors, eventually resulting in a nonzero $B-L$ asymmetry and an asymmetric DM component. Compared to conventional asymmetric-dark-matter (ADM) schemes, our framework imposes far milder requirements on the portal interaction. In particular, the portal interaction need not violate $B-L$, and the temperature scales of efficient $B-L$ violation and efficient charge-transfer interaction mediated by the portal operator can be separated. We develop the formalism in detail and argue that the flexibility of our framework enlarges the model-building landscape for ADM.

2025-07-14, **Emulating Dark Matter Halo Merger Trees with Graph Generative Models**, Tri Nguyen et.al., [2507.10652v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10652v1)

 Merger trees track the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos across cosmic time and serve as essential inputs for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on ad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information. Nguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent neural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of merger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as FLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph structures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on merger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body simulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees with both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced using the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree accurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass and redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate its utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated trees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass relation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly from the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method for generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body simulations.

2025-07-14, **Observational biases on rotation curves from IFU data at cosmic noon**, Amanda E. de Araujo-Carvalho et.al., [2507.10544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10544v1)

 Through studying rotation curves, which depict how the velocity of the stars and gas changes with distance from the center of the galaxy, it has been confirmed that dark matter dominates galaxy's outer regions, as their rotation curve remains flat. However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point, suggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during earlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological surface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation curves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman Break Analogs at $z \approx 0.2$ and artificially redshifted them as if they were at $z \approx 2.2$. By comparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that the asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low-$z$ galaxies. In low-$z$ galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes relevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more disturbance in the galaxy's gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon galaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling -- when in reality, they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and loss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised when using cosmic-noon rotation curves, as they might not accurately trace the gravitational potential of the galaxy.

 This paper focuses on extending the use of Minkowski Tensors to analyze anisotropic signals in cosmological data, focusing on those introduced by redshift space distortion. We derive the ensemble average of the two translation-invariant, rank-2 Minkowski Tensors for a matter density field that is perturbatively non-Gaussian in redshift space. This is achieved through the Edgeworth expansion of the joint probability density function of the field and its derivatives, expressing the ensemble averages in terms of cumulants up to cubic order. Our goal is to connect these theoretical predictions to the underlying cosmological parameters, allowing for parameter estimation by measuring them from galaxy surveys. The work builds on previous analyses of Minkowski Functionals in both real and redshift space and addresses the effects of Finger-of-God velocity dispersion and shot noise. We validate our predictions by matching them to measurements of the Minkowski Tensors from dark matter simulation data, finding that perturbation theory is a qualified success. Non-perturbative Finger-of-God effects remain significant at relatively large scales (R< 20 Mpc/h) and are particularly pronounced in the components parallel to the line of sight.

2025-07-15, **Revisiting Cosmic Distance Duality with Megamasers and DESI DR2: Model Independent Constraints on Early-Late Calibration**, Brijesh Kanodia et.al., [2507.11518v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11518v1)

 The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) connects the angular diameter distance ($d\_A$) and the luminosity distance ($d\_L$) at a given redshift. This fundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that photon number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A deviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low redshifts ($z < 0.04$) by combining $d\_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project with $d\_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). We find the relation to be statistically consistent with the current data. We further incorporate high-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)-based $d\_A$ measurements from DESI DR2 in combination with SNIa data, highlighting the critical role of the $r\_d-M\_b$ (early-late) calibration in testing the CDDR using these two probes. Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to derive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only BAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r\_d$ and $M\_b$. However, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this degeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific cosmological model or distance-ladder techniques. Additionally, we present a forecast incorporating the expected precision from future Megamaser and SNIa observations, demonstrating their potential to significantly tighten constraints on early-late calibration parameters, under the assumption of validity of CDDR.

2025-07-15, **The Shape of Dark Energy: Constraining Its Evolution with a General Parametrization**, Dong Ha Lee et.al., [2507.11432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11432v1)

 We consider a general dark energy (DE) model parametrized by its equation-of-state (EoS), featuring three free parameters: $w\_0$ (the present-day value of the DE EoS), $w\_{\beta}$ (quantifying the dynamical nature of the DE EoS), and $\beta$ (governing various dynamical forms of the DE EoS). The key controlling parameter $\beta$ can recover several existing DE models in the literature, such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization ($\beta = 1$), the logarithmic parametrization (in the limit $\beta \rightarrow 0$), and the linear parametrization ($\beta = -1$), alongside generate a class of new DE parametrizations for other values of $\beta$. The resulting DE scenario is constrained using a suite of the latest cosmological probes, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies from three different experiments (Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope combined with WMAP), CMB lensing, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI Year 2, and PantheonPlus from Type Ia supernovae. Our analyses reveal that stringent constraints on the DE parameters are obtained only when all cosmological probes are combined; otherwise, some parameters remain unconstrained. The present-day value of the DE EoS remains in the quintessence regime according to our results, and no significant evidence for a dynamical DE EoS is found. However, based on the $\Delta\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence analyses, we observe a mild preference for the present three-parameter DE parametrization over the CPL parametrization when all cosmological probes are taken into account. Nonetheless, the Bayesian evidence difference remains below the threshold for statistical significance according to the revised Jeffreys scale, indicating that both models are effectively equally preferred by the data.

 Transition radiation is produced when a relativistic charged particle enters or leaves a solid medium. The electrons that produce synchrotron radiation may interact with the dust in circumstellar environments, leading to the emission of transition radiation. We explore the production of transition radiation in dusty novae that also display synchrotron radiation emission. Transition radiation is emitted in the hard ultra-violet/X-ray range. We suggest that, even when the transition radiation is not itself directly observable, it may have a role in determining the ionisation balance of, and grain heating in, nova ejecta. Furthermore, it may be important in other dusty environments (such as supernova remnants) with non-thermal radio emission.

 This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the tensions of {H\_0} and {\sigma\_8} by using the latest observational data. This research also tested the newer Planck likelihood and BAO data by comparing them to their predecessors. The data that was used were: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data of Planck 2018 and Planck 2020 data; Cosmic Chronometers (CC), a sample of Supernovae Type Ia; and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). A Bayesian analysis was performed to produce the results needed for the analysis. From the analyses, the best-fit values of the parameters show that almost all models are in favour of a phantom Universe. This study also showed that the new tested data constrained the models better than the previous ones, while also showing that the observation data supports the {\Lambda}CDM model over the dynamical dark energy models

2025-07-15, **Evidence for protons accelerated and escaped from the Puppis A region using \textit{Fermi}-LAT observations**, Roberta Giuffrida et.al., [2507.11208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11208v1)

 Supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds are interesting laboratories to study the acceleration of cosmic rays and their propagation in the dense ambient medium. We analyze 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations of the supernova remnant Puppis A to investigate its asymmetric $\gamma$-ray morphology and spectral properties. This middle-aged remnant ($\sim$4 kyr) is evolving in an inhomogeneous environment, interacting with a dense molecular cloud in the northeast and a lower-density medium in the southwest. We find clear differences in both $\gamma$-ray luminosity and spectral energy distribution between these two regions. The emission from both sides is consistent with a hadronic origin. However, while the southwestern emission can be explained by standard Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), the northeastern side may involve re-acceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays or acceleration via reflected shocks in the dense cloud environment. Additionally, we identify two significant $\gamma$-ray excesses outside the remnant, including a previously unreported source to the south. These features are likely produced by cosmic rays that have escaped Puppis A and are interacting with nearby dense molecular material. From this extended emission, we estimate the total energy in escaping cosmic rays to be $W\_{CR} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{49}$ erg, providing important constraints on cosmic-ray propagation around the remnant.

2025-07-15, **A low mass, binary-stripped envelope for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo**, S. de Wet et.al., [2507.11131v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11131v1)

 Type IIb supernovae (SNe) are a transitional subclass of stripped-envelope SNe showing hydrogen lines in their spectra that gradually weaken and give way to helium lines reminiscent of SNe Ib, which is indicative of stripping through stellar winds or binary interaction. SN 2024abfo is the seventh SN IIb with a direct progenitor detection. We find that the position of the supernova in our ERIS adaptive optics imaging agrees with the progenitor position in archival HST imaging to within 19 mas. The progenitor SED is consistent with an A5 giant. Single star models predict an initial mass in the range 11 to 15 solar masses, while the most probable binary model is a 12+1.2 solar mass system with an initial period of 1.73 years. We also find significant evidence for variability of the progenitor candidate in the years prior to core-collapse. SN 2024abfo is the least luminous SN IIb with a direct progenitor detections. At late times the r-band light curve decays more slowly than the comparison SNe, which may be due to increased gamma-ray trapping. Similar to SN 2008ax, SN 2024abfo does not show a prominent double-peaked light curve. Our semi-analytic light curve modelling shows that this may be due to a very low mass of hydrogen in the outer envelope. Spectrally, SN 2024abfo is most similar to SN 2008ax at early times while at later times (80 days) it appears to show persistent Halpha absorption compared to the comparison sample. We prefer a binary system to explain the supernova and its progenitor, although we are unable to rule out single-star models. We recommend late-time observations to search for a binary companion and signatures of CSM-interaction. The absence of these features would support the hypothesis that SN 2024abfo resulted from a system which underwent a period of binary mass transfer well before (1000 yr) the explosion, resulting in a low-mass hydrogen-rich envelope.

 Energetic astrophysical phenomena, such as $\gamma$-ray bursts and supernova explosion-driven shocks in collisionless plasmas, involve various plasma kinetic instabilities, such as the Weibel instability. In this paper, we explore the evolution of the Weibel instability using the spectral analysis and physical field evolution of particle-in-cell simulations. Effects of varying parameters of the initial counter-streaming beams are detailed in reference to the total evolutionary timeline of the instability. Generation of a secondary instability and excitation of electromagnetic waves primary decay have been observed. We also discuss the filament mergers during the instability decay.

2025-07-14, **Accretion from a Shock-Inflated Companion: Spinning Down Neutron Stars to Hour-Long Periods**, Savannah Cary et.al., [2507.10682v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10682v1)

 Recent observations have unveiled a population of pulsars with spin periods of a few minutes to hours that lie beyond the traditional ``death line.'' If they originate from neutron stars (NSs), the existence of such ultra-long period pulsars (ULPs) challenges our current understanding of NS evolution and emission. In this work, we propose a new channel for disk formation based on NSs born in close binaries with main-sequence companion stars. Using a hydrodynamic simulation of supernova-companion interactions, we show that a newborn NS may gravitationally capture gas as it moves through the complex density field shaped by the explosion. For a binary separation of $20\rm~R\_\odot$ and a companion mass of $4\rm~M\_\odot$, we find the occurrence fraction for disk formation around unbound NSs to be $\sim10\%$. By modeling the disk evolution and its interaction with the NS, we find a bimodal distribution in spin periods: canonical pulsars with $P\lesssim10\rm\,s$ are the ones who lack disks or whose magnetospheres never interacted with the disk, and ULPs with $10^3\lesssim P<10^5\rm\,s$ are produced when the system undergoes a short-lived ``propeller'' phase during which the NS undergoes rapid spin-down. Such ULPs are formed under strong initial dipolar magnetic field strengths $B\_0\gtrsim10^{14}\rm\,G$, with a formation rate of $10^{-4}\rm\,yr^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. We also find that a small population of pulsars with moderate magnetic field strengths ($10^{13}\lesssim~B\_0\lesssim10^{14}\rm\,G$) and relatively slow initial periods ($P\_0\gtrsim0.1\rm\,s$) evolve to $P\sim10^2\rm\,s$, filling the gap between the bimodal distribution. Thus, our model provides a unified explanation for pulsars beyond the ``death line.''

2025-07-14, **Absolute Calibration of Cluster Mira Variables to Provide a New Anchor for the Hubble Constant Determination**, Anupam Bhardwaj et.al., [2507.10658v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10658v1)

 Mira variables in globular clusters can provide an accurate and precise absolute calibration of their period-luminosity relations (PLRs) to independently anchor the cosmic distance scale and determine the Hubble constant. We present homogeneous near-infrared ($JHK\_s$) time-series photometric observations of a sample of 55 candidate long-period variables in 18 globular clusters covering a wide metallicity range ($-1.7 < \textrm{[Fe/H]} < -0.1$ dex). The Gaia proper motions, long-period variability information, and optical-infrared colors are used to identify 41 Oxygen-rich Miras as members of the globular clusters. Mean luminosities of Miras in the $JHK\_s$ bands are independently calibrated using the recommended distances and mean parallaxes to their host clusters. Cluster Mira PLRs exhibit scatter comparable to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) variables and do not show any dependence on iron-abundance for a wide range of metallicities. We establish the accuracy of cluster Miras as independent anchors by determining a distance modulus to the LMC, $18.45 \pm 0.04$ mag, in agreement with the 1.2\% precise geometric distance. Our $H$-band photometry is transformed to derive {\it Hubble Space Telescope} F160W PLR for cluster Miras providing a three-anchor baseline with the LMC and NGC 4258. We employ three-anchor solution to determine distances to two type Ia supernovae host galaxies, NGC 1559 ($31.39\pm0.05$ mag) and M101 ($29.07\pm0.04$ mag), and provide a $3.7\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant, $H\_0 = 73.06\pm 2.67$ km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Similar to Cepheids, our independent baseline solution results in a local $H\_0$ determination that is systematically larger than its inference from the early universe probes, further supporting the ongoing Hubble tension.

 We present 1,800 multiwavelength Type Ib/c supernovae light curve models obtained by running the radiation transport code Sedona and varying the mass distribution, velocity profile, and abundance ejecta profiles of helium star progenitors. To create a flexible but physically-informed grid, we use autoencoders to construct a representation of ejecta profiles derived from stellar evolution models. We present simulated nearest-neighbor multiband light curves matches to SN 1994I, SN 2007gr, and iPTF13bvn to demonstrate that realistic light curves can be generated in our grid. We show that the ejecta velocity distribution, in particular, strongly influences the light curve, while variation in Ni-56 alone has a limited impact on the bolometric light curve, even in extreme and unphysical mixing schemes; however, mixing can modestly impact color evolution. Finally, we show that the Ni-56 mass, ejecta mass, and both the magnitude and structure of ejecta velocity distribution can be inferred from the multiband light curves, enabling improved inference over widely used semianalytical models.

 Spiral galaxy disks are thought to exist in a quasi-stationary state, between fresh gas accretion from cosmic filaments and disk star formation, self-regulated through supernovae feedback. Our goal here is to quantify these processes and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10 Myr time-scales through H$\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at 100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI emission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes using fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on studies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of these fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for the HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\alpha$ tracer. We have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by Kamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong criteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and derive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\alpha$ and young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94 Myr) is deprived of H$\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to study simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and kinematic evidence is of primordial importance. In M101, we have quantified how stellar feedback is responsible for carving the observed cavities in the atomic gas disk, and how it can expel above the disk the neutral gas, which is then unavailable for star formation during up to 100 Myr.

 We present a unified approach to the transition from hadronic matter to quark matter where hadrons are treated as bound states of quarks which dissociate at high densities due to quark Pauli blocking. The newly developed approach makes use of a cluster virial expansion formulated in terms of a generalized $\Phi$-derivable approach to multi-quark correlations with bound and continuum states in their spectrum encoded in hadron phase shifts. Our model can be used to obtain thermodynamic functions not only at zero and small chemical potentials, where they are consistent with lattice QCD simulations, but also at large chemical potentials where lattice QCD simulations have the sign problem. By applying a reaction-kinetic criterion for the chemical freeze-out of multi-quark clusters in heavy-ion collisions, we demonstrate that the chemical freeze-out coincides with their Mott transition. The approach can be applied to study the effects of the QCD transition on primordial black hole formation in the early Universe and on hybrid neutron star formation in supernova explosions and binary neutron star mergers.

2025-07-14, **Massive stars advanced evolution: I -- New reaction rates for carbon and oxygen nuclear reactions**, T. Dumont et.al., [2507.10377v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10377v1)

 The nuclear rates for reactions involving 12C and 16O are key to compute the energy release and nucleosynthesis of massive stars during their evolution. These rates shape the stellar structure and evolution, and impact the nature of the final compact remnant. We explore the impact of new nuclear reaction rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O, 12C+12C, 12C+16O and 16O+16O reactions for massive stars. We aim to investigate how the structure and nucleosynthesis evolve and how these processes influence the stellar fate. We computed stellar models using the GENEC code, including updated rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O and, for the three fusion reactions, new rates following a fusion suppression scenario and new theoretical rates obtained with TDHF calculations. The updated 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O rates mainly impact the chemical structure evolution changing the 12C/16O ratio with little effect on the CO core mass. This variation in the 12C/16O ratio is critical for predicting the stellar fate, which is very sensitive to 12C abundance. The combined new rates for 12C+12C and 16O+16O fusion reactions according to the HIN(RES) model lead to shorter C- and O-burning lifetimes, and shift the ignition conditions to higher temperatures and densities. Theoretical TDHF rates primarily affect C-burning, increasing its duration and lowering the ignition temperature. These changes alter the core chemical structure, the carbon shell size and duration, and hence the compactness. They also affect nucleosynthesis. This work shows that accurate reaction rates for key processes in massive star evolution drive significant changes in stellar burning lifetimes, chemical evolution, and stellar fate. In addition, discrepancies between experimental and theoretical rates introduce uncertainties in model predictions, influencing both the internal structure and the supernova ejecta composition.

2025-07-14, **Anisotropy of core-collapse supernovae effected by AGN disks**, Jiao-Zhen She et.al., [2507.10040v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10040v1)

 Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk provide dense environments to influence on the star formation, evolution, and migration. In AGN disks, pressure gradients and migration accelerations could create the anisotropy of the core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) when the massive stars explode at the end of their lives. In this study, we construct the equilibrium equations by considering the above two factors and then compute the light curves for three types of progenitor stars at different locations of AGN disks for the different supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, accretion efficiencies, explosion energies, and masses of ejecta. The results show that the migration acceleration has more significant effects on the anisotropic explosions than the pressure gradients of the AGN disks. The anisotropic luminosities are pronounced at large radii, and massive SMBHs would suppress the anisotropy and reduce the total luminosity.

 Analyses by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration suggest a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when their baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and various Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples. In this work, we systematically investigate the origin of the deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM reported in recent cosmological analyses by combining different CMB datasets, BAO measurements, and DESY5 SNIa samples within the $w\_0w\_a$CDM framework. We find that the DESY5 SNIa sample, particularly its low-redshift component (DES-lowz), the Planck CMB data, the lensing measurements of Planck and ACT-DR6, and the DESI-DR2 BAO measurements contribute most significantly to the observed tensions. In contrast, combinations involving DES-SN, WMAP, SPT, and ACT-DR6 remain consistent with $\Lambda$CDM within $\sim1\sigma$. Our results highlight the critical impact of SNIa systematics, CMB data, and the choice of BAO dataset on constraints of dynamical dark energy models. These findings underscore the importance of improved calibration, homogeneity, and cross-validation of observational datasets to robustly assess potential deviations from the standard cosmological model.

2025-07-14, **Supernova-induced binary-interaction-powered supernovae: a model for SN2022jli**, Ryosuke Hirai et.al., [2507.09974v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09974v1)

 We present 3D hydrodynamical modelling of supernova-induced binary-interaction-powered supernovae; a scenario proposed for the peculiar type Ic supernova SN2022jli. In this scenario, supernova ejecta of a stripped-envelope star impacts a close-by stellar companion, temporarily inflating the envelope. The expanded envelope engulfs the neutron star, causing strong mass accretion at super-Eddington rates. Feedback from the accretion powers the supernova light curve with periodic undulations. Our simulations capture key features of SN2022jli, both the overall decline and the superimposed undulations of the light curve. Based on our parameter study, we find that (i) the accretion feedback should be sufficiently geometrically confined and the eccentricity of the post-supernova binary orbit should be $0.7\lesssim e\lesssim0.9$ to sustain a high accretion rate, and (ii) the viewing angle should be close to edge-on to match the low undulation amplitude ($\Delta L/L\sim0.1$) of SN2022jli. Different combinations of parameters could account for other supernovae like SN2022mop, SN2009ip and SN2015ap. We also discuss possible explanations for other key features of SN2022jli such as the $\gamma$-ray detection at $\sim200~\mathrm{d}$ and the rapid optical drop at $\sim250~\mathrm{d}$. Finally, we speculate on the future evolution of the system and its relation to existing neutron star binaries.
