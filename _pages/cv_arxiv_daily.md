2025-12-29, **Scrutinizing the KNT model with vacuum stability conditions**, Tim Huesmann et.al., [2512.23662v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23662v1)

 The Krauss-Nasri-Trodden (KNT) model provides a unified framework for addressing the smallness of neutrino masses (by a three-loop radiative mechanism) and the dark matter abundance (via thermal freeze-out) simultaneously. In this work, we investigate the implications of renormalization group effects on the model's parameter space. To this end, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to identify the viable regions of parameter space that is consistent with all the relevant experimental and theoretical constraints at low energies. We show that a significant portion of the low-energy viable region is incompatible with the vacuum stability conditions once the renormalization group effects are taken into account. Most of the remaining parameter space of the model can be probed in future charged lepton flavor violating experiments.

2025-12-29, **Prospects for detecting charged long-lived BSM particles at MoEDAL-MAPP experiment: A mini-review**, Rafał Masełek et.al., [2512.23387v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23387v1)

 The search for physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider is expanding to include unconventional signatures such as long-lived particles. This mini-review assesses the prospects for detecting electrically charged long-lived particles using the MoEDAL-MAPP experiment. We synthesize findings from recent studies that evaluate sensitivity to supersymmetric models, radiative neutrino mass scenarios, and generic multiply charged objects. A key component of this review is the comparative analysis of MoEDAL's reach against the general-purpose ATLAS and CMS experiments. We conclude that while MoEDAL is constrained by lower integrated luminosity, its passive, background-free detection methodology offers a unique advantage. Specifically, the experiment provides complementarity to the major detectors, particularly for signals involving slow-moving particles and stable states with intermediate electric charges.

2025-12-29, **Fine-tuning final state interactions model in NuWro Monte Carlo event generator**, Hemant Prasad et.al., [2512.23350v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23350v1)

 Recent experimental data from MINERvA on transverse kinematics observables across four different nuclear targets - carbon, oxygen, iron, and lead - have been utilized to refine the modeling of final state interaction effects in the NuWro Monte Carlo neutrino event generator. For this purpose, we have developed an event reweighting tool for future applications to adjust the strength of final-state interactions. This study highlights the requirement for stronger nucleon reinteractions than previously assumed, but it still falls within the uncertainty range observed in a study comparing proton transparency measurements. This conclusion has significant implications for both experimental and theoretical work involving NuWro.

2025-12-29, **Unveiling Multimessenger Emission from Hidden Cores of Microquasars**, Yu-Jia Wei et.al., [2512.23231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23231v1)

 Microquasars are radio-emitting X-ray binaries accompanied by relativistic jets. They are established sources of 100~TeV gamma rays and are considered promising candidates for cosmic-ray acceleration. Motivated by recent detections of $\sim 100~$TeV photons from Cygnus~X-1 and $\sim~$PeV photons from Cygnus~X-3 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we employ the Astrophysical Multimessenger Emission Simulator (AMES) to model their multimessenger emission considering compact outflow regions as cosmic-ray accelerators, spanning from radio to ultra-high-energy gamma rays. Our results show that the observed $>$TeV gamma rays can originate from either $pγ$ or $pp$ interactions, depending on the location and physical conditions of the emission region, while also reproducing the lower-energy spectra. The different configurations yield unique, observationally testable predictions. In the $0.1-10$~TeV energy range, where current observations provide only upper limits, they predict either a deep dip, a mild suppression, or a power-law spectrum. Additionally, models involving AU-scale blob regions predict strong variability, while those invoking more extended and static external zones show more stable behavior. We also provide a possible qualitative explanation for the distinct modulation patterns across different energy bands, which relies primarily on changes in the Doppler factor and external $γγ$ absorption. Finally, our neutrino predictions, which properly account for muon and pion cooling effects, reveal a significantly suppressed flux, indicating that detecting these sources may be more challenging than previously anticipated.

2025-12-28, **Factorized distorted wave calculations for electron, neutrino, and BSM processes**, Alexis Nikolakopoulos et.al., [2512.22763v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22763v1)

 We point out that, under certain conditions, the nuclear currents that couple to vector bosons can be written as the trace of the product of two matrices. One contains `nucleon dynamics', e.g. form factors, the other contains the overlaps of nuclear wavefunctions. This factorized form may always be obtained and viewed as a `local' approximation, in which particle four-momenta that enter in the transition operator are fixed to their asymptotic values. We write the overlap matrix in a general form in terms of Dirac matrices. The current with arbitrary couplings to the nucleon can then be evaluated using standard trace identities. We show that this encompasses non-relativistic models as well. We have tabulated overlaps obtained in the relativistic distorted-wave impulse approximation, which can be used to compute the single-nucleon knockout cross section. We give a self-contained overview of the formulae. We discuss some properties of the overlap matrices which may be derived from general principles, and highlight differences with the commonly used plane-wave impulse approximation. The factorized form is attractive for (neutrino) event generators: it abstracts away the nuclear model and allows to easily modify couplings to the nucleon. This allows to consistently treat electron, neutrino and beyond Standard Model (BSM) processes.

2025-12-28, **Lepton Number Violation at the LHC in Radiative Neutrino Mass Models with Leptoquarks**, K. S. Babu et.al., [2512.22756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22756v1)

 We investigate the prospects for observing lepton number violation (LNV) by two units, $\|ΔL\| = 2$, at the LHC within the leptoquark variant of the Zee Model, where Majorana neutrino masses arise radiatively at one-loop. The model features an $SU(2)\_L$ doublet and singlet leptoquarks, whose interactions produce a distinctive same-sign dilepton plus jets signature, $pp \to \ell^{\pm}\ell'^{\pm} + \text{jets}$. Taking into account current experimental constraints, we identify the dominant production channels for this LNV signal and perform a detailed collider analysis. We find that the HL-LHC can probe leptoquark masses up to $m\_{\rm LQ} \sim 1.5~\mathrm{TeV}$ with this process. Observation of this signal would provide a direct test of LNV and would unambiguously establish the Majorana nature of neutrinos.

2025-12-29, **Limits on dark matter existence in neutron stars from recent astrophysical observations and mass correlation analysis**, Jing Fu Hu et.al., [2512.23577v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23577v1)

 Dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANSs) serve as a specific astrophysical laboratory for probing the features of dark matter (DM) and have emerged as a promising candidate for interpreting recent astrophysical observations (e.g., by NICER and LIGO/Virgo). Accurately constraining the internal DM content of DANSs is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we construct the equations of state (EoS) for DANS matter by employing twelve nuclear matter (NM) models within the covariant density functional (CDF) theory and a self-interacting fermionic model for DM. Using these EoSs as input, we solve the two-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations to systematically investigate the influence of DM on the global properties of neutron stars (NSs). By incorporating recent observational constraints on NS properties, the maximum DM mass fraction $f\_χ^{\mathrm{max}}$ in DANSs is determined for each NM EoS model. Our analysis reveals a strong linear correlation (Pearson coefficient $r=0.98$) between $f\_χ^{\mathrm{max}}$ and the maximum mass of a pure NS, $M\_{\rm{NS}}^{\mathrm{max}}$, described by $f\_χ^{\mathrm{max}} = 0.22 M\_{\mathrm{NS}}^{\mathrm{max}} - 0.44$. Leveraging this correlation and the observed NS maximum mass distribution, $P(M\_{\text{NS}}^{\max} \mid \text{EM})$, we derive the probability distribution function (PDF) for the maximum DM mass, $P(M\_χ^{\max} \mid \text{EM})$, in DANSs. We find that at the 68\% confidence level, $M\_χ^{\mathrm{max}}=0.150^{+0.070}\_{-0.051}\ M\_{\odot}$. This quantitative constraint on the DM mass provides a critical prior for interpreting potential observational signatures of DANSs, such as anomalous tidal deformabilities and distinctive gravitational-wave signals.

2025-12-29, **Defect Formation in NaI Crystals: A Novel Pathway to Dark Matter Detection**, G. Angloher et.al., [2512.23553v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23553v1)

 Sodium iodide (NaI) is a widely used scintillator in direct dark matter searches. In particular, NaI-based cryogenic scintillating calorimeters have emerged as promising candidates, like in the COSINUS experiment, for testing the annually modulating signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA. In this study, we investigate defect formation within NaI crystals and its impact on the dark matter detection signal. Using molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory techniques, we simulate a DM particle collision on an NaI crystal, focusing on the possible defects formation and their structural and electronic properties. Our analysis includes a detailed study of the electronic states associated with the interstitial atoms and vacancies, the energetic cost of defect formation, and the anisotropic threshold displacement energy. Finally, we highlight the potential to exploit dark matter-induced defects as a novel detection channel, enabled by the introduction of new states within the electronic band gap.

2025-12-29, **Observations of the Fermi bubbles and the Galactic center excess with the DArk Matter Particle Explorer**, F. Alemanno et.al., [2512.23458v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23458v1)

 The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space-borne high-energy particle detector that surveys the $γ$-ray sky above$\sim 2~\rm GeV$ with a peak acceptance of $\sim 0.2~\rm m^2\,sr$. With the 102 months of data collected by DAMPE, we show that the Fermi bubbles are detected at a significance of $\sim 26σ$ and identify a GeV excess in the direction of Galactic center at $\sim 7 σ$ confidence. Both spectra and morphology are consistent with those observed by Fermi-LAT and the GeV excess component can be interpreted by the dark matter annihilation with a mass of $\sim 50$ GeV and a velocity-averaged cross section of $\sim 10^{-26}~{\rm cm^{3}~s^{-1}}$ for the $χχ\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ channel. Our results thus provide the first independent detection of these two intriguing diffuse gamma-ray sources besides Fermi-LAT.

2025-12-29, **Are 2HDMs with a gauged $U(1)$ symmetry alive?**, Yuanchao Lou et.al., [2512.23450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23450v1)

 We investigate the phenomenology of 2 Higgs doublet models (2HDMs) with a new $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, $U(1)\_X$, by which flavor changing neutral currents are forbidden at tree level. As an important consequence of the spontaneous breaking of both the $U(1)\_X$ and electroweak symmetries by electroweak vacuum expectation values, upper limits appear on masses of an additional gauge boson $Z'$ and extra Higgs bosons which are less than the TeV scale. In addition, the standard model (SM) like Higgs boson $h$ and a heavier Higgs boson $H$ mainly decay into a pair of $Z'$ which induces four lepton final states. These new decay modes cannot be suppressed by taking no $Z$-$Z'$ mixing and/or the Higgs alignment limit. We find that the minimum setup of these 2HDMs has been excluded by current data for four lepton searches at LHC. Such severe constraints can, however, be avoided by introducing a pair of vector-like fermions $χ$ which are singlet under the SM symmetry but charged under $U(1)\_X$, and can be a candidate of dark matter. Thanks to the existence of $χ$, $Z'$ can mainly decay into $χ\barχ$ instead of SM leptons. As benchmark models, we consider the $U(1)\_H$ and $U(1)\_R$ models realized by fixing specific $U(1)\_X$ charges, and find regions of parameter space allowed by theoretical and current experimental constraints. We clarify that $m\_H \in [160, 220]$ GeV and $\tan β\in [3, 4.4]$ are allowed in the $U(1)\_H$ model, while $m\_H \in [160, 380]$ GeV and $\tan β\in [1.6, 4.4]$ are allowed in the $U(1)\_R$ model. In both the models, the $Z'$ mass is constrained to be $100~\text{GeV} \lesssim m\_{Z'} \lesssim 110$ GeV. Such a quite limited parameter space can further be explored at future collider experiments, e.g., High-Luminosity LHC and lepton colliders.

2025-12-29, **New Constraints on Cosmic-ray boosted Sub-GeV Dark Matter via Light Mediators**, Yang Yu et.al., [2512.23282v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23282v1)

 Traditional direct detection experiments lack the sensitivity to probe the sub-GeV dark matter (DM), primarily due to the low energy of the expected nuclear recoils. In this work, we investigate cosmic-ray (CR) upscattering as a mechanism to accelerate DM particles to detectable velocities in underground experiments. By analyzing four models of DM-nucleon interactions -- namely scalar, vector, pseudoscalar, and axial-vector mediators -- we derive constraints on the coupling parameters using data from the LZ, XENON, and Borexino experiments, covering mediator mass from $10^{-6}$ to $1$ GeV. As the mediator mass varies, the shift in dominance between momentum transfer and mediator mass leads to a turnover in the constraints around $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}~\mathrm{GeV}$. Our results extend the reach of direct detection into the sub-GeV window and clarify the critical role of momentum dependence in light-mediator scenarios.

2025-12-29, **Mass distribution of ultralight boson in binary black hole systems**, Hang Yang et.al., [2512.23279v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23279v1)

 Ultralight bosons are compelling dark-matter candidates. Both scalar and vector bosons can be produced through black hole superradiance, forming a boson cloud surrounding a rotating black hole. Self-interaction of bosons, together with transition mixing in binary black hole systems, give rise to dynamical phenomena that could be potentially observable with future gravitational wave observations. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of bosons in binary black hole systems. In particular, we focus on boson mass transfer in unequal-mass binary black hole systems with arbitrary spin-orientation of the companion. Our results show that the mass ratio between the companion and the primary black holes significantly affects cloud absorption through mass transfer. Moreover, when the companion's spin is not aligned with that of the primary, the efficiency of cloud depletion is further modified.

2025-12-29, **New Physics Searches at BESIII**, Vindhyawasini Prasad et.al., [2512.23241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23241v1)

 This report highlights the recent BESIII results related to the new physics searches motivated by the shortcomings of Standard Model, such as the exclusion of dark matter (DM). DM has so far been inferred only through astrophysical observations and accounts for a large fraction of matter density of the universe. DM may couple to SM particles via various portals. These portals give rise to several possible new particles beyond the SM, such as light Higgs bosons, dark photons, axion-like particles, or spin-1/2 fermions. Furthermore, the origin of DM and the observed asymmetry between visible matter and antimatter may be connected through the introduction of a dark baryon. The signature of these new physics particles could be accessible by the BESIII if their masses lie in the few-GeV range.

2025-12-29, **Complex scalar dark matter with effective Higgs portals beyond radiation domination**, Manimala Mitra et.al., [2512.23228v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23228v1)

 The increasingly stringent bounds on the Higgs-portal coupling, arising from dark matter (DM) direct-detection searches, confront the minimal renormalizable complex scalar DM scenario with thermal production, where freeze-out occurs in the standard radiation-dominated era. This limitation can be alleviated by introducing a dimension-5 Higgs-portal operator in the minimal renormalizable complex scalar DM model and/or by modifying the standard cosmological history of the Universe. In this article, we analyze complex scalar DM production in both the reheating and radiation-dominated epochs within an effective field theory (EFT) framework. While both scenarios exhibit sizeable regions of parameter space consistent with existing constraints, freeze-out during reheating opens up additional viable regions that are otherwise ruled out by DM overabundance in the radiation-dominated scenario. Notably, the renormalizable Higgs-portal coupling is constrained by relic density, direct- and indirect-detection limits, whereas the EFT coupling associated with the dimension-5 operator is constrained by relic density and indirect-detection bounds arising from DM semi-annihilation. We further study the production cross section of complex scalar DM at hadron and lepton colliders.

2025-12-29, **Search for Annual Modulation in Combined ANAIS 112 and COSINE 100 Data using Bayesian Model Comparison**, Om Godse et.al., [2512.23191v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23191v1)

 We perform a Bayesian model comparison test between a sinusoidal modulation model and a constant value model using about three years of combined COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 data. We use both uniform priors and normal priors (based on DAMA best-fit values) for the angular frequency and phase of the cosine signal. We find natural log of Bayes factor for the cosine model comapred to the constant value model to be less than 1.15 for the data in both 1-6 keV and 2-6 keV energy intervals. This shows that there is no evidence for cosine signal from dark matter interactions in the combined ANAIS-112/COSINE-100 data. Our analysis codes have also been made publicly available.

2025-12-29, **Muonphilic asymmetric dark matter at a future muon collider**, Arnab Roy et.al., [2512.23159v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23159v1)

 We explore phenomenological constraints on, and future muon collider sensitivities to, the parameter spaces of various muonphilic portals to fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM). Both WEFT-level dimension-6 effective operators and two UV models based on gauged $L\_μ- L\_τ$ are considered. One of the latter features a vector coupling to the dark matter and the other an axial vector coupling. The ADM criterion that at least $99\%$ of the dark matter relic density is asymmetric is also imposed. We identify which of these scenarios are currently allowed by direct detection and collider constraints, and then determine how much more of the parameter space could be probed by 3 and 10 TeV muon colliders with 1 ab$^{-1}$ of data. For the UV models, the constraints from $g-2$ of the muon are included. The future sensitivity curves due to neutron star heating considerations are also depicted. We present results for both the few-GeV dark matter mass regime motivated by ADM approaches to the $Ω\_b \simeq Ω\_\text{DM}/5$ coincidence problem, and for larger masses in the context of more general ADM.

2025-12-28, **Dark matter direct detection: status, results and future plans**, Laura Baudis et.al., [2512.23039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23039v1)

 Direct dark matter detection experiments search for rare signals induced by hypothetical, galactic dark matter particles in low-background detectors operated deep underground. I will briefly review the direct detection principles, the expected signals and backgrounds, and the main experimental techniques. I will then discuss the status of ongoing experiments aiming to discover new particles in the keV - TeV mass range, as well as future detectors and their sensitivity.

2025-12-28, **Exact solutions for a complex scalar field under discrete symmetry**, D. Bazeia et.al., [2512.23031v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23031v1)

 We report on the presence of families of exact solutions for a complex scalar field that behaves according to the rules of discrete $Z\_N$ symmetry. Since the family of models is exactly solved, the results appear to be of interest to integrability, to build junctions and networks of localized structures and to describe scalar dark matter in high energy physics.

2025-12-28, **An Empirical Law to Reproduce the Galaxy Rotation Curves**, Kento Kamada et.al., [2512.23008v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23008v1)

 Profiles of galaxy's rotation velocity (rotation curves) remain unexpectedly flat at large distances, where visible matter alone should make the rotation speed decrease with radius. The usual explanation requires large amounts of unseen dark matter. Here, we introduce an empirical law in which spacetime itself appears to store additional energy when distorted by baryonic matter. The baryonic potential $Φ\_b$ made by the baryonic energy density $ρ\_b$ generates an additional energy density $ρ\_s = μ\_s Φ\_b^2 / c^4$, leading to a Poisson equation for the total potential $Φ\_{\rm tot}$, \[ \nabla^2Φ\_{\rm tot} = 4πG\,ρ\_b /c^2 + 4πG\,μ\_s\,Φ\_b^2 / c^6. \] When assuming $μ\_s = K M\_b^{-3/2}$ with a parameter $K$, we applied this equation to 91 galaxies from the SPARC database. The model reproduced quite well both the inner rise and outer flat regions of the observed rotation curves using the observed baryonic mass profiles only. The $K$ values for the 91 galaxies were found to be concentrated within a narrow range. These results suggest that dark matter is directly connected to the baryonic gravitational potential. A theoretical interpretation of the empirical law is also discussed, in which a relation between the additional energy and the cosmological constant is implied.

2025-12-28, **A new path to constrain the expansion history of the Universe in future spectroscopic galaxy surveys**, Elena Tomasetti et.al., [2512.22964v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22964v1)

 The current tension between early- and late-Universe measurements of the Hubble constant ($H\_0$), along with the still elusive nature of dark matter and dark energy, calls for model-independent probes of the Universe's expansion history. The cosmic chronometers (CC) method offers a unique opportunity to directly measure the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ without relying on any cosmological model assumptions or integrated distance measurements. Despite its potential, this technique remains statistics-limited: no current survey is optimized to detect large samples of CC, restricting the precision on $H(z)$ to $\sim$20% at intermediate redshifts. Here, we investigate the opportunities that a next-generation spectroscopic facility could offer to CC studies, providing an estimate of the accuracy achievable on the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter in redshift. We demonstrate that with such a facility, it will be possible to derive constraints on key cosmological parameters, assessing the impact that such improvements would have on our understanding of the expansion history of the Universe and on current cosmological tensions.

2025-12-28, **Primordial black holes within Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini approach**, Brahim Asfour et.al., [2512.22924v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22924v1)

 In this paper, we investigate the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) during the radiation-dominated era. The collapse of significant density perturbations originating from large primordial scalar fluctuations generated during inflation can lead to the formation of primordial black holes. In our study, we adopt the Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini model as our framework, in which the inflaton field and the Palatini curvature are non-minimally coupled. To achieve our objective, we analyze the behavior of the primordial curvature power spectrum, which exhibits a large enhancement at small scales corresponding to large wavenumbers $k$. Furthermore, we examine the probability of PBHs formation by studying the mass variance, $σ(M\_{PBH})$, and the mass fraction of the total energy density collapsing into PBHs, $β(M\_{PBH})$. The evolution of both functions is consistent with current observational constraints. Finally, we investigate the abundance of primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We found that they can account for the totality or a fraction of the current dark matter content, depending primarily on the values of the coupling constant and the e-folds number.

2025-12-29, **Transitioning late-time cosmology with the Hubble parameterization**, Vinod Kumar Bhardwaj et.al., [2512.23561v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23561v1)

 We investigate a late-time cosmological model for a homogeneous and isotropic space-time in the Rastall theory. We explore the observational constraints on the Hubble parameter by using the latest cosmological datasets such as cosmic microwave background radiation (Planck), baryon acoustic oscillations (DESI) and Type Ia Supernovae (Union 3.0). As a result, we explicitly demonstrate that the specific redshift transition occurs, namely, there happens a phase shift in the evolution of the universe from the initial deceleration era to the current accelerating phase of the cosmological scenario. Furthermore, we show that with the latest dataset of DESI-BAO clubbed with CC, CMB, and Union 3.0, the current value of the Hubble parameter is estimated as $H\_0 = 66.945 \pm 1.094$, which can be compatible with the available observations.

2025-12-29, **Unveiling SN 2022eyw: A Bright Member of the Type Iax Supernova Subclass**, Hrishav Das et.al., [2512.23428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23428v1)

 We present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of Supernova (SN) 2022eyw, a luminous member of the Type Iax SN subclass. SN 2022eyw reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M\_g = -17.80\pm0.15$ mag and exhibited a rise time of $\sim$15 days, placing it among the brighter Iax events. The bolometric light curve indicates a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.120\pm0.003~\text{M}\_{\odot}$, with an estimated ejecta mass of $0.79\pm0.09~\text{M}\_{\odot}$ and kinetic energy of $0.19\times10^{51}$ erg. The spectral evolution from -8 to +110 days past maximum reveals features characteristic of bright Type Iax Supernovae, including a transition from Fe III to Fe II dominance, moderate expansion velocities, and a lack of strong C III absorption. TARDIS spectral modelling of the early-phase spectra indicates a well-mixed ejecta dominated by Fe-group elements. In addition, traces of unburnt carbon are detected, pointing to incomplete burning as expected in pure deflagration models. Late-time spectral evolution shows a blend of permitted and forbidden lines. Comparison with deflagration models suggests that SN 2022eyw originated from a partial deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, with explosion properties intermediate between the N3-def and N5-def models. These observations support pure deflagration of a CO white dwarf as a viable explosion mechanism for its luminous members.

2025-12-29, **SiO emission in the filamentary Infrared Dark Cloud G035.39-00.33: An ALMA view**, Rong Liu et.al., [2512.23384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23384v1)

 Filamentary infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are believed to represent the initial conditions for massive star and cluster formation. We investigate the IRDC G035.39-00.33 using SiO, H13CO+, CH3OH, and CS emission observed with ALMA at 3.5\arcsec\ resolution (0.05 pc). The SiO emission traces shock activity within the cloud, providing insights into current star formation and cloud formation mechanisms. We identify several regions with broad SiO emission clearly associated with outflows, pinpointing the locations of ongoing star formation across the cloud. The ALMA images also reveal a series of spatially extended SiO emission spots with narrow line profiles, aligned along an arc-like path that is also seen in CS and CH3OH emission. While the broad SiO emission is mainly associated with the main cloud filament, as seen in visual extinction, the narrow SiO arch is located at the edge of the cloud, far from the identified sites of star formation activity. The presence of these arc-like morphologies suggests that large-scale shocks may have compressed the gas in the surroundings of the G035.39-00.33 cloud, shaping its filamentary structure. By inspecting the large-scale radio continuum emission around G035.39-00.33, we find that this IRDC is part of a larger star-forming complex where the densest and coolest material appears at the interacting regions between a Supernova Remnant (SNR) and an expanding HII region. In particular, we hypothesize that this IRDC may be spatially coincident with the ionized expanding gas associated with the previously identified SNR G35.6-0.4. We suggest that collisions between giant molecular clouds and expanding gas flows from interacting SNRs and HII regions may be responsible for the observed arc-like structures. Such shock compressions could play an important role in the formation of IRDCs and in the potential triggering of star formation.

2025-12-29, **SN 2022acko: a low-luminosity SNe IIP with signs of early circumstellar interaction**, Lin Han et.al., [2512.23267v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23267v1)

 We present optical-ultraviolet photometry and optical spectra for the type II supernova (SN) 2022acko. The spectroscopic observations span phases from $\sim$ 1.5 to $\sim$ 60 days after the explosion, while the light curve was observed up to $\sim$ 300 days. The V-band peak is $-15.5 \pm 0.3$ mag, suggesting that SN 2022acko is a low-luminosity SN II (LLSN). The overall observed properties of SN 2022acko are consistent with those produced by a lower mass progenitor ($\rm M\_{ZAMS} \sim $9-10M$\_{\odot}$). The spectra at $t=1.5$d and $t=2.5$d exhibit a broad emission feature peaking near 4600 Å(the ``ledge'' feature), which we interpret as blueshifted He II 4686 Ålines arising from the ionized ejecta. Moreover, a possible flash-ionized (FI) emission line of H$α$ (FWHM $\sim 1100\ \rm km \ s^{-1}$) was superposed on the broad emission component of H$α$ P-Cgyni profile in the $t=1.5$d spectrum. Assuming an ejecta velocity of $\rm 12000\ km\ s^{-1}$, the rapid disappearance of this narrow H$α$ emission line within two days suggests highly confined CSM within $\sim \rm 2\times10^{14}\, cm$. Assuming a spherically symmetric CSM, the mass loss rate within this radius is estimated to be $\rm \sim 5 \times 10^{-4} M\_{\odot} \ year^{-1}$ based on our hybrid light curve model. The early ``ledge'' feature observed in SN 2022acko have also been observed in other SNe II, suggesting that early-phase circumstellar interaction (CSI) is more common than previously thought.
