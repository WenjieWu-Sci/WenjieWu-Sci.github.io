2023-11-14, **Expanding neutrino oscillation parameter measurements in NOvA using a Bayesian approach**, NOvA Collaboration et.al., [2311.07835v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07835v1)

 NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that measures oscillations in charged-current $\nu\_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu\_{\mu}$ (disappearance) and $\nu\_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu\_{e}$ (appearance) channels, and their antineutrino counterparts, using neutrinos of energies around 2 GeV over a distance of 810 km. In this work we reanalyze the dataset first examined in our previous paper [Phys. Rev. D 106, 032004 (2022)] using an alternative statistical approach based on Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We measure oscillation parameters consistent with the previous results. We also extend our inferences to include the first NOvA measurements of the reactor mixing angle $\theta\_{13}$ and the Jarlskog invariant. We use these results to quantify the strength of our inferences about CP violation, as well as to examine the effects of constraints from short-baseline measurements of $\theta\_{13}$ using antineutrinos from nuclear reactors when making NOvA measurements of $\theta\_{23}$. Our long-baseline measurement of $\theta\_{13}$ is also shown to be consistent with the reactor measurements, supporting the general applicability and robustness of the PMNS framework for neutrino oscillations.

2023-11-14, **The HIBEAM program: search for neutron oscillations at the ESS**, V. Santoro et.al., [2311.08326v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08326v1)

 With the construction of the European Spallation Source, a remarkable opportunity has emerged to conduct high sensitivity searches for neutron oscillations, including a first search for thirty years for free neutrons converting to antineutrons. Furthermore, searches can be made for transitions of neutrons and antineutrons to sterile neutron states. The HIBEAM program provides an increase in sensitivity of an order of magnitude compared to previous work.   The HIBEAM program corresponds to baryon number violation by one and two units. The observation of a process satisfying a Sakharov condition addresses the open question of the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Sterile neutron states would belong to a `dark' sector of particles which may explain dark matter. As electrically neutral, meta-stable objects that can be copiously produced and studied, neutrons represent an attractive portal to a `dark' sector.   This paper describes the capability, design, infrastructure, and potential of the HIBEAM program. This includes a dedicated beamline, neutron optical system, magnetic shielding and control, and detectors for neutrons and antineutrons.

2023-11-14, **The scale invariant scotogenic model: CDF-II $W$-boson mass and the 95~GeV excesses**, Amine Ahriche et.al., [2311.08297v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08297v1)

 The anomalies observed in the $W$ mass measurements at the CDF-II experiments and the excesses seen around 95~GeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) motivate this work, in which we investigate and constrain the parameter space of the Scale Invariant Scotogenic Model with a Majorana dark matter candidate. The scanned parameters are chosen to be consistent with the dark matter relic density and the observed excesses at $\sim95$~GeV signal strength rates in $\gamma\gamma$, $b\bar b$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ final states. Furthermore, the model's viable parameters can be probed in both the LHC and future $e^+e^-$ colliders for di-Higgs production.

2023-11-14, **Spin Speed and Supportedness Correlation and Evolution of Galaxy-Halo Systems**, Ming-Jie Sheng et.al., [2311.07969v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07969v1)

 Galaxy angular momenta (spins) contain valuable cosmological information, complementing with their positions and velocities. The baryonic spin direction of galaxies have been probed as a reliable tracer of their host halos and the primordial spin modes. Here we use the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to study the spin magnitude correlations between dark matter, gas and stellar components of galaxy-halo systems, and their evolutions across the cosmic history. We find that these components generate similar initial spin magnitudes from the same tidal torque in Lagrangian space. At low redshifts, the gas component still traces the spin magnitude of dark matter halo and the primordial spin magnitude. However, the traceability of stellar component depends on the $ex$ $situ$ stellar mass fraction, $f\_{\rm acc}$. Our results suggest that the galaxy baryonic spin magnitude can also serve as a tracer of their host halo and the initial perturbations, and the similarity of their evolution histories affects the galaxy-halo correlations.

2023-11-14, **Strong Microwave Squeezing Above 1 Tesla and 1 Kelvin**, Arjen Vaartjes et.al., [2311.07968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07968v1)

 Squeezed states of light have been used extensively to increase the precision of measurements, from the detection of gravitational waves to the search for dark matter. In the optical domain, high levels of vacuum noise squeezing are possible due to the availability of low loss optical components and high-performance squeezers. At microwave frequencies, however, limitations of the squeezing devices and the high insertion loss of microwave components makes squeezing vacuum noise an exceptionally difficult task. Here we demonstrate a new record for the direct measurement of microwave squeezing. We use an ultra low loss setup and weakly-nonlinear kinetic inductance parametric amplifiers to squeeze microwave noise 7.8(2) dB below the vacuum level. The amplifiers exhibit a resilience to magnetic fields and permit the demonstration of record squeezing levels inside fields of up to 2 T. Finally, we exploit the high critical temperature of our amplifiers to squeeze a warm thermal environment, achieving vacuum level noise at a temperature of 1.8 K. These results enable experiments that combine squeezing with magnetic fields and permit quantum-limited microwave measurements at elevated temperatures, significantly reducing the complexity and cost of the cryogenic systems required for such experiments.

2023-11-14, **Detecting Dark Matter Induced Power in Quantum Devices**, Anirban Das et.al., [2311.07857v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07857v1)

 In the past few years, many mesoscale systems have been proposed as possible detectors of sub-GeV dark matter particles. In this work, we point out the feasibility of probing dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section using superconductor-based quantum devices with meV-scale energy threshold. We compute new limits on spin-independent dark matter scattering cross section using the existing power measurement data from three different experiments for MeV to 10 GeV mass. We derive the limits for both halo and thermalized dark matter populations.

2023-11-14, **Evaporation Ages: a New Dating Method for Young Star Clusters**, V. -M. Pelkonen et.al., [2311.08363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08363v1)

 The ages of young star clusters are fundamental clocks to constrain the formation and evolution of pre-main-sequence stars and their protoplanetary disks and exoplanets. However, dating methods for very young clusters often disagree, casting doubts on the accuracy of the derived ages. We propose a new method to derive the kinematic age of star clusters based on the evaporation ages of their stars. The method is validated and calibrated using hundreds of clusters identified in a supernova-driven simulation of the interstellar medium forming stars for approximately 40 Myr within a 250 pc region. We demonstrate that the clusters' evaporation-age uncertainty can be as small as about 10% for clusters with a large enough number of evaporated stars and small but realistic observational errors. We have obtained evaporation ages for a pilot sample of 10 clusters, finding a good agreement with their published isochronal ages. The evaporation ages will provide important constraints for modeling the pre-main-sequence evolution of low-mass stars, as well as to investigate the star-formation and gas-evaporation history of young clusters. These ages can be more accurate than isochronal ages for very young clusters, for which observations and models are more uncertain.

2023-11-14, **Isolated Neutron Stars**, Alice Borghese et.al., [2311.08353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08353v1)

 Non-accreting neutron stars display diverse characteristics, leading us to classify them into several groups. This chapter is an observational driven review in which we survey the properties of the different classes of isolated neutron stars: from the 'normal' rotation-powered pulsars, to magnetars, the most magnetic neutron stars in the Universe we know of; from central compact objects (sometimes called also anti-magnetars) in supernova remnants, to the X-ray dim isolated neutron stars. We also highlight a few sources that have exhibited features straddling those of different sub-groups, blurring the apparent diversity of the neutron star zoo and pointing to a gran unification.

2023-11-14, **Eruptive novae in symbiotic systems**, Irin Babu Vathachira et.al., [2311.08334v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08334v1)

 We conduct numerical simulations of multiple nova eruptions in detached, widely separated symbiotic systems that include an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companion to investigate the impact of white dwarf (WD) mass and binary separation on the evolution of the system. The accretion rate is determined using the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton method, incorporating orbital momentum loss caused by factors such as gravitational radiation, magnetic braking, and drag. The WD in such a system accretes matter coming from the strong wind of an AGB companion until it finishes shedding its envelope. This occurs on an evolutionary time scale of $\approx 3 \times 10^5$ years. Throughout all simulations, we use a consistent AGB model with an initial mass of $1.0 \mathrm {M\_\odot}$ while varying the WD mass and binary separation, as they are the critical factors influencing nova eruption behavior. We find that the accretion rate fluctuates between high and low rates during the evolutionary period, significantly impacted by the AGB's mass loss rate. We show that unlike novae in cataclysmic variables, the orbital period may either increase or decrease during evolution, depending on the model, while the separation consistently decreases. Furthermore, we have identified cases in which the WDs produce weak, non-ejective novae and experience mass gain. This suggests that provided the accretion efficiency can be achieved by a more massive WD and maintained for long enough, they could potentially serve as progenitors for type Ia supernovae.

2023-11-14, **Monitoring broad emission-line components in spectra of the two low-metallicity dwarf compact star-forming galaxies SBS 1420+540 and J1444+4840**, N. G. Guseva et.al., [2311.08286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08286v1)

 We report the discovery of broad components with P-Cygni profiles of the hydrogen and helium emission lines in the two low-redshift low-metallicity dwarf compact star-forming galaxies (SFG), SBS 1420+540 and J1444+4840. We found small stellar masses of 10^{6.24} and 10^{6.59} M$\_\odot$, low oxygen abundances 12+log O/H of 7.75 and 7.45, high velocity dispersions reaching $\sigma$ ~700 and ~1200km/s, high terminal velocities of the stellar wind of ~1000 and ~1000-1700km/s, respectively, and large EW(H$\beta$) of ~300A for both. For SBS 1420+540, we succeeded in capturing an eruption phase by monitoring the variations of the broad-to-narrow component flux ratio. We observe a sharp increase of that ratio by a factor 4 in 2017 and a decrease by about an order of magnitude in 2023. The peak luminosity of ~10^{40}ergs/s of the broad component in $L$(H$\alpha$) lasted for about 6 years out of a three-decades monitoring. This leads us to conclude that there is probably a LBV candidate (LBVc) in this galaxy. As for J1444+4840, its very high $L$(H$\alpha$) of about 10^{41}ergs/s, close to values observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and Type IIn Supernovae (SNe), and the variability of no more than 20 per cent of the broad-to-narrow flux ratio of the hydrogen and helium emission lines over a 8-year monitoring do not allow us to definitively conclude that it contains a LBVc. On the other hand, the possibility that the line variations are due to a long-lived stellar transient of type LBV/SNIIn cannot be ruled out.

2023-11-14, **The Impact of Dust on Cepheid and Type Ia Supernova Distances**, Dillon Brout et.al., [2311.08253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08253v1)

 Milky-Way and intergalactic dust extinction and reddening must be accounted for in measurements of distances throughout the universe. This work provides a comprehensive review of the various impacts of cosmic dust focusing specifically on its effects on two key distance indicators used in the distance ladder: Cepheid variable stars and Type Ia supernovae. We review the formalism used for computing and accounting for dust extinction and reddening as a function of wavelength. We also detail the current state of the art knowledge of dust properties in the Milky Way and in host galaxies. We discuss how dust has been accounted for in both the Cepheid and SN distance measurements. Finally, we show how current uncertainties on dust modeling impact the inferred luminosities and distances, but that measurements of the Hubble constant remain robust to these uncertainties.

2023-11-14, **Constraining Baryonic Physics with DES Y1 and Planck data -- Combining Galaxy Clustering, Weak Lensing, and CMB Lensing**, Jiachuan Xu et.al., [2311.08047v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08047v1)

 We constrain cosmology and baryonic feedback scenarios with a joint analysis of weak lensing, galaxy clustering, cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing, and their cross-correlations (so-called 6$\times$2) using data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 and the Planck satellite mission. Noteworthy features of our 6$\times$2 pipeline are: We extend CMB lensing cross-correlation measurements to a band surrounding the DES Y1 footprint (a $\sim 25\%$ gain in pairs), and we develop analytic covariance capabilities that account for different footprints and all cross-terms in the 6$\times$2 analysis. We also measure the DES Y1 cosmic shear two-point correlation function (2PCF) down to $0.^\prime 25$, but find that going below $2.^\prime 5$ does not increase cosmological information due to shape noise. We model baryonic physics uncertainties via the amplitude of Principal Components (PCs) derived from a set of hydro-simulations. Given our statistical uncertainties, varying the first PC amplitude $Q\_1$ is sufficient to model small-scale cosmic shear 2PCF. For DES Y1+Planck 6$\times$2 we find $S\_8=0.799\pm0.016$, comparable to the 5$\times$2 result of DES Y3+SPT/Planck $S\_8=0.773\pm0.016$. Combined with our most informative cosmology priors -- baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and Planck 2018 EE+lowE, we measure $S\_8=0.817\pm 0.011$. Regarding baryonic physics constraints, our 6$\times$2 analysis finds $Q\_1=2.8\pm1.8$. Combined with the aforementioned priors, it improves the constraint to $Q\_1=3.5\pm1.3$. For comparison, the strongest feedback scenario considered in this paper, the cosmo-OWLS AGN ($\Delta T\_\mathrm{heat}=10^{8.7}$ K), corresponds to $Q\_1=5.84$.
