2023-04-05, **Primordial Black Hole Leptogenesis in Supersymmetry**, Suhail Khan et.al., [2304.02604v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02604v1)

 We have studied the role of Hawking evaporation of primordial black hole in the production of the supersymmetric particles like sneutrinos - the super-partner of heavy right handed neutrinos. Considering lepton number violating decays of such particles and $CP$ violating phases due to soft supersymmetry breaking terms, we have obtained the baryonic asymmetry of the universe which depends on the mass of primordial black holes. Apart from CMB and BBN constraints on such mass, we have shown more stringent upper bound on this mass from the requirement of black hole evaporation temperature to be above the temperature required for almost first order phase transition so that leptogenesis could create the observed baryonic asymmetry. We have shown how the primordial black hole mass, heavy right handed neutrino mass and soft supersymmetry breaking parameters are related from the requirement of successful leptogenesis and the allowed parameter space to avoid gravitino problem. Considering experimental constraint on branching ratio of $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma $, we have shown the connection of right handed neutrino mass scale with the lower bound of the typical mass scale of supersymmetric particles.

2023-04-05, **Robust and efficient CMB lensing power spectrum from polarization surveys**, Louis Legrand et.al., [2304.02584v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02584v1)

 Deep surveys of the CMB polarization have more information on the lensing signal than the quadratic estimators (QE) can capture. We showed in a recent work that a CMB lensing power spectrum built from a single optimized CMB lensing mass map, working in close analogy to state-of-the-art QE techniques, can result in an essentially optimal spectrum estimator at reasonable numerical cost. We extend this analysis here to account for real-life non-idealities including masking and realistic instrumental noise maps. As in the QE case, it is necessary to include small corrections to account for the estimator response to these anisotropies, which we demonstrate can be estimated easily from simulations. The realization-dependent debiasing of the spectrum remains robust, allowing unbiased recovery of the band powers even in cases where the statistical model used for the lensing map reconstruction is grossly wrong. This allows now robust and at the same time optimal CMB lensing constraints from CMB data, on all scales relevant for the inference of the neutrino mass, or other parameters of our cosmological model.

2023-04-05, **Testing generalized neutrino interactions with PTOLEMY**, Indra Kumar Banerjee et.al., [2304.02505v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02505v1)

 There are several unanswered questions regarding neutrinos which pave the way for physics beyond the standard model (SM) of particle physics. Generalized interactions of neutrinos provide a way to characterize these effects in a manner which is even more general than the oft-studied non-standard neutrino interactions. These interactions are described by higher dimensional operators maintaining the SM gauge symmetries. On the other hand cosmic neutrino background, although yet to be detected directly, is a robust prediction of the SM and the standard cosmology. We perform a global analysis of the relevant generalized neutrino interactions which are expressly relevant for the proposed cosmic neutrino detector PTOLEMY. The electron spectrum due to the capture of cosmic neutrinos on radioactive tritium gets modified due to the presence of these generalized interactions. We also show how the differential electron spectrum is sensitive to the finite experimental resolution, mass of the lightest neutrino eigenstate, the strength of these interactions and the ordering of neutrino mass.

2023-04-05, **Quantum mismatch: a powerful measure of "quantumness" in neutrino oscillations**, Dibya S. Chattopadhyay et.al., [2304.02475v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02475v1)

 The quantum nature of neutrino oscillations would be reflected in the mismatch between the neutrino survival probabilities with and without an intermediate observation. We propose this ``quantum mismatch'' as a measure of quantumness in neutrino oscillations, which precisely extracts the interference term in the two-flavor limit. In the full three-flavor scenario, we provide modified definitions of the Leggett-Garg and quantum mismatch measures. These are applicable for long-baseline and reactor neutrino experiments that measure neutrino survival probabilities with negligible matter effects.

2023-04-05, **Gravitational echoes of lepton number symmetry breaking with light and ultralight Majorons**, Andrea Addazi et.al., [2304.02399v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02399v1)

 We formulate a version of the low-scale Majoron model equipped with an inverse seesaw mechanism featuring lepton-number preserving dimension-6 operators in the scalar potential. Contrary to its dimension-4 counterpart, we find that the model can simultaneously provide light and ultralight Majorons, neutrino masses and their mixing, while featuring strong first-order cosmological phase transitions associated to the spontaneous breaking of the lepton number and the electroweak symmetries in the early Universe. We show by a detailed numerical analysis that under certain conditions on the parameter space accounted for in collider physics, the model can be probed via the primordial gravitational wave spectrum potentially observable at LISA and other planned facilities.

2023-04-04, **First demonstration of $\mathcal{O}(1\,\text{ns})$ timing resolution in MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber**, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., [2304.02076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02076v1)

 MicroBooNE is a neutrino experiment located in the Booster Neutrino Beamline (BNB) at Fermilab, which collected data from 2015 to 2021. MicroBooNE's liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) is accompanied by a photon detection system consisting of 32 photomultiplier tubes used to measure the argon scintillation light and determine the timing of neutrino interactions. Analysis techniques combining light signals and reconstructed tracks are applied to achieve a neutrino interaction time resolution of $\mathcal{O}(1\,\text{ns})$. The result obtained allows MicroBooNE to access the ns neutrino pulse structure of the BNB for the first time. The timing resolution achieved will enable significant enhancement of cosmic background rejection for all neutrino analyses. Furthermore, the ns timing resolution opens new avenues to search for long-lived-particles such as heavy neutral leptons in MicroBooNE, as well as in future large LArTPC experiments, namely the SBN program and DUNE.

2023-04-04, **Anomalous Tau Neutrino Appearance from Light Mediators in Short-Baseline Neutrino Experiments**, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., [2304.02031v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02031v1)

 We point out a new mechanism giving rise to anomalous tau neutrino appearance at the near detectors of beam-focused neutrino experiments, without extending the neutrino sector. The charged mesons ($\pi^\pm, K^\pm$) produced and focused in the target-horn system can decay to a (neutrino-philic) light mediator via the helicity-unsuppressed three-body decays. If such a mediator carries non-vanishing hadronic couplings, it can also be produced via the bremsstrahlung of the incident proton beam. The subsequent decay of the mediator to a tau neutrino pair results in tau neutrino detection at the near detectors, which is unexpected under the standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation paradigm. We argue that the signal flux from the charged meson decays can be significant enough to discover the light mediator signal at the on-axis liquid-argon near detector of the DUNE experiment, due to the focusing of charged mesons. In addition, we show that ICARUS-NuMI, an off-axis near detector of the NuMI beam, as well as DUNE, can observe a handful of tau neutrino events induced by beam-proton bremsstrahlung.

2023-04-04, **Fast flavor evolution in dense neutrino systems, as described in quantum field theory**, R. F. Sawyer et.al., [2304.01987v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01987v1)

 Investigations of dense neutrino cloud evolution through quantum kinetic equations led to the possibility of ``fast flavor" (FF) processes. It is shown here that the usual quantum kinetic equations, while signaling the instabilities that make some instances of FF possible, are being erroneously interpreted. Approaching the subject directly from the quantum field theory that defines the standard model shows the computational structures in most of the recent FF literature to be completely invalid. Our revisions also underlie what could be a treasure trove of new early universe applications and a general result for relic supernova neutrinos that could be tested as a feature of the diffuse neutrino spectrum.

2023-04-04, **Cause of discrepancy problem of calculated running sums to nuclear matrix element of two-neutrino double-$Î²$ decay**, J. Terasaki et.al., [2304.01719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01719v1)

 A qualitative difference in the running sum to the nuclear matrix element of the two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay of $^{136}$Xe has been found four years ago between QRPA and shell model calculations. The former result has large increase and decrease with respect to the excitation energy of the intermediate state, and the latter one is an almost monotonically and mildly increasing function. My QRPA calculations independent of the above one do not have a remarkable decrease. This discrepancy is a serious problem affecting the reliability of calculations of the neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay, and the cause was unknown. I perform several relevant test calculations and consider analytically to find the cause, which is found to be in the strength of the attractive interactions. The possible major local decrease in the running sum is also explained analytically. The interactions of my QRPA calculation are appropriate in terms of the strength, thus, the almost monotonic behavior is reasonable.

2023-04-05, **A Quantum Perspective on Oscillation Frequencies in Axion Dark Matter Experiments**, Joerg Jaeckel et.al., [2304.02523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02523v1)

 In this note we look at the time evolution of signals in axion dark matter experiments from a quantum perspective. Our aim is not to contribute new results to the general discussion of the quantum/classical connection (which we do not) but rather to slightly illuminate the specific case of axion experiments. From the classical perspective one expects a signal oscillating with a frequency equal to the axion mass whose amplitude is slowly rising due to the tiny interaction of the axions with ordinary matter. In the quantum picture the latter, slow time-scale arises from the small splitting in the energy levels induced by the interaction between the axions and the experiment, and it is always present in suitable, sensitive experiments. Signals that oscillate with a frequency equal to the axion mass, however, arise from processes changing the axion number. Yet, depending on the chosen observable, such oscillations may be absent for certain special initial quantum states of the axions. However, we show by example that, using an appropriate experimental procedure, these special states can be modified by the experiment in such a way that a signal oscillating with the axion mass re-appears. In addition, we discuss the measurement of suitable correlators that feature an oscillation with the axion mass. We also comment on the connection to the classical treatment. The explicit experiment we look at is an oscillating EDM experiment such as CASPEr but we expect our results to be easily adaptable to other types of axion dark matter experiments.

2023-04-05, **Gravitational waves from cosmic strings associated with pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter**, Ze-Yu Qiu et.al., [2304.02506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02506v1)

 We study stochastic gravitational waves from cosmic strings generated in an ultraviolet-complete model for pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter with a hidden $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge symmetry. The dark matter candidate in this model can naturally evade direct detection bounds and easily satisfy other phenomenological constraints. The bound on the dark matter lifetime implies an ultraviolet scale higher than $10^9~\mathrm{GeV}$. The spontaneous $\mathrm{U(1)}$ symmetry breaking at such a high scale would induce cosmic strings with high tension, resulting in a stochastic gravitational wave background with a high energy density. We investigate the constraints from current gravitational wave experiments as well as the future sensitivity. We find that most of the viable parameter points could be well studied in future gravitational wave experiments.

2023-04-04, **Study of deflection angles, thin accretion structure, and the observational signatures of a static $f(R)$ black hole**, Mohsen Fathi et.al., [2304.02111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02111v1)

 In this paper, we constrain the linear dark-matter-related parameter of a static spherically symmetric f (R) black hole spacetime regarding the observed angular diameters of M87* and Sgr A* from the EHT. We then investigate the light deflection angles inferred from direct analytical calculation of null geodesics and that obtained from the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Assuming an optically thin accretion disk for the black hole and after discussing its properties, we conceive different emission profiles and investigate the shadow cast of this black hole when it is illuminated by the disk. Furthermore, we simulate the brightness of an infalling spherical accretion in the context of the silhouette imaging of the black hole. We find that, excluding some specific cases, the specific observed brightness of the accretion disk consists of the direct emission, rather than that for the lensing and photon rings. Furthermore, it is revealed that the linear dark parameter of the black hole has considerable effects on the size of the shadow and its brightness. The discussion is done both analytically and numerically, and ray-tracing methods are employed to generate proper visualizations

2023-04-04, **Eternal binaries**, Jaime Redondo-Yuste et.al., [2304.02039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02039v1)

 The two-body problem is extensively studied in open systems and asymptotically flat spacetimes. However, there are many systems where radiation is trapped: they range from radiating charges in cavities to low-energy excitations of massive degrees of freedom, to anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Here, we study the problem of motion of a pointlike particle orbiting a massive compact object inside a cavity. We first show that - assuming circular motion - there are initial conditions for which the self-force vanishes and the binary is eternal. We then consider the evolution of the system under radiation reaction in a toy model which we argue captures the essentials of orbiting particles. We show that eternal circular binaries may exist. We also show that the presence of cavity modes leads to chaos in regimes of strong coupling or when the system is initialized close enough to a resonance. Our results have implications for physics in anti-de Sitter spacetimes and possibly for binaries evolving within dark matter haloes, if it consists on massive fundamental fields.

2023-04-04, **The spatial clustering of ROSAT all-sky survey Active Galactic Nuclei: V. The evolution of broad-line AGN clustering properties in the last 6 Gyr**, M. Krumpe et.al., [2304.02036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02036v1)

 This is the fifth paper in a series of investigations of the clustering properties of luminous, broad-emission line active galactic nuclei (AGN) identified in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In this work we measure the cross-correlation function (CCF) between RASS/SDSS DR14 AGN with the SDSS CMASS galaxy sample at $0.44<z<0.64$. We apply halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling to the CCF along with the auto-correlation function of the CMASS galaxies. We find that X-ray and optically-selected AGN at $0.44<z<0.64$ reside in statistically identical halos with a typical dark matter halo mass of $M\_{\rm DMH}^{\rm typ,AGN} \sim 10^{12.7}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{M}\_\odot$. The acceptable HOD parameter space for these two broad-line AGN samples have only statistically marginal differences caused by small deviations of the CCFs in the 1-halo dominated regime on small scales. In contrast to optically-selected AGN, the X-ray AGN sample may contain a larger population of satellites at $M\_{\rm DMH} \sim 10^{13}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{M}\_\odot$. We compare our measurements in this work with our earlier studies at lower independent redshift ranges, spanning a look-back time of 6 Gyr. The comparison over this wider redshift range of $0.07<z<0.64$ reveals: (i) no significant difference between the typical DMH masses of X-ray and optically-selected AGN, (ii) weak positive clustering dependencies of $M\_{\rm DMH}^{\rm typ,AGN}$ with $L\_X$ and $M\_{\rm BH}$, (iii) no significant dependence of $M\_{\rm DMH}^{\rm typ,AGN}$ on Eddington ratio, and (iv) the same DMH masses host more massive accreting black holes at high redshift than at low redshifts.

2023-04-04, **Albatross: A scalable simulation-based inference pipeline for analysing stellar streams in the Milky Way**, James Alvey et.al., [2304.02032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02032v1)

 Stellar streams are potentially a very sensitive observational probe of galactic astrophysics, as well as the dark matter population in the Milky Way. On the other hand, performing a detailed, high-fidelity statistical analysis of these objects is challenging for a number of key reasons. Firstly, the modelling of streams across their (potentially billions of years old) dynamical age is complex and computationally costly. Secondly, their detection and classification in large surveys such as Gaia renders a robust statistical description regarding e.g., the stellar membership probabilities, challenging. As a result, the majority of current analyses must resort to simplified models that use only subsets or summaries of the high quality data. In this work, we develop a new analysis framework that takes advantage of advances in simulation-based inference techniques to perform complete analysis on complex stream models. To facilitate this, we develop a new, modular dynamical modelling code sstrax for stellar streams that is highly accelerated using jax. We test our analysis pipeline on a mock observation that resembles the GD1 stream, and demonstrate that we can perform robust inference on all relevant parts of the stream model simultaneously. Finally, we present some outlook as to how this approach can be developed further to perform more complete and accurate statistical analyses of current and future data.

2023-04-04, **Kinetic relaxation and Bose-star formation in multicomponent dark matter- I**, Mudit Jain et.al., [2304.01985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01985v1)

 Using wave kinetics, we estimate the emergence time-scale of gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates/Bose stars in the kinetic regime for a general multicomponent Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson (SP) system. We identify some effects of the diffusion and friction pieces in the wave-kinetic Boltzmann equation (at leading order in perturbation theory) and provide estimates for the kinetic nucleation rate of condensates. We test our analysis using full $3+1$ dimensional simulations of multicomponent SP system. With an eye towards applications to multicomponent dark matter, we investigate two general cases in detail. First is a massive spin-$s$ field with $N=2s+1$ components (scalar $s=0$, vector $s=1$ and tensor $s=2$). We find that for a democratic population of different components, the condensation time-scale is $\tau\_{(s)}\approx \tau\_0\times N$, where $\tau\_0$ is the condensation time scale for the scalar case. Second is the case of two scalars with different boson masses. In this case, we map-out how the condensation time depends on the ratios of their average mass densities and boson masses, revealing competition and assistance between components, and a guide towards which component condenses first. For instance, with $m\_1 < m\_2$ and not too disparate mass densities, we verify that the time scale of condensation of the first species quickly becomes independent of $m\_2/m\_1$, whereas for equal average number densities, the emergence time scale decreases with increasing $m\_2/m\_1$.

2023-04-04, **Gravitational Bose-Einstein Condensation of Vector/Hidden Photon Dark Matter**, Jiajun Chen et.al., [2304.01965v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01965v1)

 We study the gravitational Bose-Einstein condensation of a massive vector field in the kinetic regime and the non-relativistic limit using non-linear dynamical numerical methods. Gravitational condensation leads to the spontaneous formation of solitons. We measure the condensation time and growth rate, and compare to analytical models in analogy to the scalar case. We find that the condensation time of the vector field depends on the correlation between its different components. For fully correlated configurations, the condensation time is the same as that for a scalar field. On the other hand, uncorrelated or partially correlated configurations condense slower than the scalar case. As the vector soliton grows, it acquires a net spin angular momentum even if the total spin angular momentum of the initial conditions is zero.

2023-04-04, **Growth of Perturbations in Energy-Momentum-Squared Gravity**, Bita Farsi et.al., [2304.01571v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01571v1)

 Employing the spherical collapse (SC) formalism, we investigate the linear evolution of the matter overdensity for energy-momentum-squared gravity (EMSG) which in practical phenomenological terms, one may imagine as an extension of \LambdaCDM model of cosmology. The underlying model while still having a cosmological constant, is a nonlinear matter extension of the general theory of relativity and includes modification terms dominating in the high energy regimes i.e., early universe. Considering the Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background in the presence of a cosmological constant, we find the effects of the modifications arising from EMSG on the growth of perturbations at the early stages of the universe. By taking into account both possible negative, and positive values of the model parameter of EMSG, we discuss its role in the evolution of the matter density contrast and growth function in the level of linear perturbations. While EMSG leaves imprints distinguishable from \LambdaCDM, we find that the negative range of the ESMG model parameter is not well-behaved indicating an anomaly in the parameter space of the model. In this regard, for the evaluation of the galaxy cluster number count in the framework of EMSG, we equivalently provide an analysis of the number count of the gravitationally collapsed objects (or the dark matter halos). We show that the galaxy cluster number count decreases compared to the \LambdaCDM model. In agreement with the hierarchical model of structure formation, in EMSG cosmology also the more massive structures are less abundant, meaning that form at later times.

2023-04-04, **Search for bosonic super-weakly interacting massive particles at COSINE-100**, G. Adhikari et.al., [2304.01460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01460v1)

 We present results of a search for bosonic super-weakly interacting massive particles (BSW) as keV scale dark matter candidates that is based on an exposure of 97.7 kg$\cdot$year from the COSINE experiment. In this search, we employ, for the first time, Compton-like as well as absorption processes for pseudoscalar and vector BSWs. No evidence for BSWs is found in the mass range from 10 $\mathrm{keV/c}^2$ to 1 $\mathrm{MeV/c}^2$, and we present the exclusion limits on the dimensionless coupling constants to electrons $g\_{ae}$ for pseudoscalar and $\kappa$ for vector BSWs at 90% confidence level. Our results show that these limits are improved by including the Compton-like process in masses of BSW, above $\mathcal{O}(100\,\mathrm{keV/c}^2)$.

2023-04-05, **Searching for ejected supernova companions in the era of precise proper motion and radial velocity measurements**, A. A. Chrimes et.al., [2304.02542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02542v1)

 The majority of massive stars are born in binaries, and most unbind upon the first supernova. With precise proper motion surveys such as Gaia, it is possible to trace back the motion of stars in the vicinity of young remnants to search for ejected companions. Establishing the fraction of remnants with an ejected companion, and the photometric and kinematic properties of these stars, offers unique insight into supernova progenitor systems. In this paper, we employ binary population synthesis to produce kinematic and photometric predictions for ejected secondary stars. We demonstrate that the unbound neutron star velocity distribution from supernovae in binaries closely traces the input kicks. Therefore, the observed distribution of neutron star velocities should be representative of their natal kicks. We evaluate the probability for any given filter, magnitude limit, minimum measurable proper motion (as a function of magnitude), temporal baseline, distance and extinction that an unbound companion can be associated with a remnant. We compare our predictions with results from previous companion searches, and demonstrate that the current sample of stars ejected by the supernova of their companion can be increased by a factor of 5-10 with Gaia data release 3. Further progress in this area is achievable by leveraging the absolute astrometric precision of Gaia, and by obtaining multiple epochs of deep, high resolution near-infrared imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST and next-generation wide-field near-infrared observatories such as Euclid or the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

2023-04-04, **Direct formation of massive black holes via dynamical collapse in metal-enriched merging galaxies at $z \sim 10$: fully cosmological simulations**, Lucio Mayer et.al., [2304.02066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02066v1)

 We present the results of the first fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations studying the merger-driven model for massive black hole (BH) seed formation via direct collapse. Using the zoom-in technique as well as particle splitting, we achieve a final spatial resolution of $2$ pc. We show that the major merger of two massive galaxies at redshift $z \sim 8$ results in the formation of a nuclear supermassive disk (SMD) of only $4$ pc in radius, owing to a prodigious gas inflow sustained at $100$-$1000$ $M\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The core of the merger remnant is metal-rich, well above solar abundance, and the SMD reaches a gaseous mass of $3 \times 10^8$ $M\_{\odot}$ in less than a million years after the merger, despite a concurrent prominent nuclear starburst. Dynamical heating as gas falls into the deepest part of the potential well, and heating and stirring by supernova blastwaves, generate a turbulent multi-phase interstellar medium, with a gas velocity dispersion exceeding 100 km s$^{-1}$. As a result, only moderate fragmentation occurs in the inner $10$-$20$ pc despite the temperature falls below $1000$ K. The SMD is Jeans-unstable as well as bar-unstable and will collapse further adiabatically, becoming warm and ionized. We show that the SMD, following inevitable contraction, will become general relativistic unstable and directly form a supermassive BH of mass in the range $10^6$-$10^8$ $M\_{\odot}$, essentially skipping the stage of BH seed formation. These results confirm that mergers between the most massive galaxies at $z \sim 8$-$10$ can naturally explain the rapid emergence of bright high-redshift quasars.

2023-04-04, **The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: Corrections on photometry due to wavelength-dependent atmospheric effects**, J. Lee et.al., [2304.01858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01858v1)

 Wavelength-dependent atmospheric effects impact photometric supernova flux measurements for ground-based observations. We present corrections on supernova flux measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program's 5YR sample (DES-SN5YR) for differential chromatic refraction (DCR) and wavelength-dependent seeing, and we show their impact on the cosmological parameters $w$ and $\Omega\_m$. We use $g-i$ colors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to quantify astrometric offsets caused by DCR and simulate point spread functions (PSFs) using the GalSIM package to predict the shapes of the PSFs with DCR and wavelength-dependent seeing. We calculate the magnitude corrections and apply them to the magnitudes computed by the DES-SN5YR photometric pipeline. We find that for the DES-SN5YR analysis, not accounting for the astrometric offsets and changes in the PSF shape cause an average bias of $+0.2$ mmag and $-0.3$ mmag respectively, with standard deviations of $0.7$ mmag and $2.7$ mmag across all DES observing bands (\textit{griz}) throughout all redshifts. When the DCR and seeing effects are not accounted for, we find that $w$ and $\Omega\_m$ are lower by less than $0.004\pm0.02$ and $0.001\pm0.01$ respectively, with $0.02$ and $0.01$ being the $1\sigma$ statistical uncertainties. Although we find that these biases do not limit the constraints of the DES-SN5YR sample, future surveys with much higher statistics, lower systematics, and especially those that observe in the $u$ band will require these corrections as wavelength-dependent atmospheric effects are larger at shorter wavelengths. We also discuss limitations of our method and how they can be better accounted for in future surveys.

2023-04-04, **Sibling Rivalry: SNeIa Diversity and the Hubble Tension**, Richard S. Miller et.al., [2304.01831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01831v1)

 Thermonuclear supernovae, or Type-Ia supernovae (SNeIa), are an essential tool of cosmology. Precise cosmological constraints are extracted from a Hubble diagram defined by homogeneous distance indicators, but supernova homogeneity is not guaranteed. The degree of heterogeneity within the SNeIa parent population is unknown. In addition, event selections and standardization procedures are based on empirical, optically-measured observables rather than fundamental thermonuclear properties. Systematics are a natural consequence of event selection from a diverse parent population. Quantifying the impact of diversity-driven systematics is crucial to optimizing SNeIa as cosmic probes. In this work, the empirical observables are used to calibrate previously unidentified diversity-driven systematic uncertainties. The foundation of this approach is the concept of "supernova siblings'', two or more supernovae hosted by the same parent galaxy. Sibling-based calibrations isolate intrinsic differences between supernovae; they control for source distance and host galaxy dependencies that can conceal systematics or lead to their underestimation. Newly calibrated distance modulus uncertainties are approximately an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. The physical origin of these uncertainties is plausibly attributed to the diverse thermonuclear scenarios responsible for SNeIa and the inhomogeneous apparent magnitudes induced by this diversity. Systematics mitigation strategies are discussed. Cosmological parameter constraints extracted from a re-analysis of the Pantheon+ SNeIa dataset are weaker than previously reported. Agreement with early-Universe parameter estimates is achieved for a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, including a reduction of the Hubble Tension from $\sim$5$\sigma$ to <1$\sigma$.
