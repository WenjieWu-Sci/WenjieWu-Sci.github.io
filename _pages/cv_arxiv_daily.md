2024-11-27, **Gravitational Influence on the Quantum Speed Limit in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System**, Abhishek Kumar Jha et.al., [2411.18604v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18604v1)

 We investigate the quantum speed limit (QSL) during the time evolution of neutrino-antineutrino system under the influence of the gravitational field of a spinning primordial black hole (PBH). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using the Boyer-Lindquist (BL) coordinates. This gravitational potential leads to an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, contributing to the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino systems. Our findings indicate that the gravitational field, expressed in BL coordinates, significantly influences the transition probabilities in two-flavor oscillations of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then apply the expression for transition probabilities between states to analyze the Bures angle, which quantifies the closeness between the initial and final states of the time-evolved flavor state. We use this concept to probe the QSL for the time evolution of the initial flavor neutrino state.

2024-11-27, **Modular invariant inflation, reheating and leptogenesis**, Gui-Jun Ding et.al., [2411.18603v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18603v1)

 We use modular symmetry as an organizing principle that attempts to simultaneously address the lepton flavor problem, inflation, post-inflationary reheating, and baryogenesis. We demonstrate this approach using the finite modular group $A\_4$ in the lepton sector. In our model, neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I see-saw mechanism, with modular symmetry dictating the form of the Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses. The modular field also drives inflation, providing an excellent fit to recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. The corresponding prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small, $r \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$, while the prediction for the running of the spectral index, $\alpha \sim -\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, could be tested in the near future. An appealing feature of the setup is that the inflaton-matter interactions required for reheating naturally arise from the expansion of relevant modular forms. Although the corresponding inflaton decay rates are suppressed by the Planck scale, the reheating temperature can still be high enough to ensure successful Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We find that the same couplings responsible for reheating also contribute to generating part of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through non-thermal leptogenesis.

2024-11-27, **Influence of gravity on the quantum speed limit in neutrino oscillations**, Abhishek Kumar Jha et.al., [2411.18558v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18558v1)

 The quantum speed limits (QSLs) determine the minimal amount of time required for a quantum system to evolve from an initial to a final state. We investigate QSLs for the unitary evolution of the neutrino-antineutrino system in the presence of a gravitational field. It is known that the transition probabilities between neutrino and antineutrino in the framework of one and two flavors depend on the strength of the gravitational field. The behavior of the QSL time in the two-flavor system indicates fast flavor transitions as the gravitational field strength increases. Subsequently, we observe quick suppression of entanglement by exploring the speed limit for entanglement entropy of two-flavor oscillations in the neutrino-antineutrino system in the proximity of a spinning primordial black hole.

2024-11-27, **Test RG Running of the Leptonic Dirac CP Phase with Reactor Neutrinos**, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., [2411.18251v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18251v1)

 We propose the possibility of using the near detector at reactor neutrino experiments to probe the renormalization group (RG) running effect on the leptonic Dirac CP phase $\delta\_D$. Although the reactor neutrino oscillation cannot directly measure $\delta\_D$, it can probe the deviation $\Delta \delta \equiv \delta\_D(Q^2\_d) - \delta\_D(Q^2\_p)$ caused by the RG running. Being a key element, the mismatched momentum transfers at neutrino production ($Q^2\_p$) and detection ($Q^2\_d$) processes can differ by two orders. We illustrate this concept with the upcoming JUNO-TAO experiment and obtain the projected sensitivity to the CP RG running beta function $\beta\_\delta$.

2024-11-27, **GeV ALP from TeV Vector-like leptons**, Arturo de Giorgi et.al., [2411.18246v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18246v1)

 We present a model where a GeV axion-like-particle (ALP) is predicted in a large portion of the parameter space due to the presence of explicit Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking terms in an exotic leptonic sector. The latter provides a solution to the muon $g-2$ anomaly, within the framework of the Linear Seesaw neutrino mechanism. The spectrum is extended by a complex scalar singlet only transforming under the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which generates the ALP. Its couplings with fermions can continuously span over many orders of magnitude, which constitutes a specific feature of this model in contrast to generic ultraviolet constructions. Interestingly, these couplings are suppressed by the ALP characteristic scale that can be as low as the TeV scale, which represents a novel feature of the model and opens up to several phenomenological consequences.

2024-11-27, **Hadron production in the charged current semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering of $N=Z$ nuclei**, Wenyan Yu et.al., [2411.18080v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18080v1)

 The charged current weak interaction can distinguish quark flavors, it provides a valid method to determine (transverse momentum dependent) parton distribution functions in high energy reactions by utilizing tagged hadrons. In this paper, we calculate the charged current semi-inclusive deeply inelastic neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering of $N=Z$ nuclei. Semi-inclusive means that a spin-1 hadron is also measured in addition to the scattered charged lepton. The target nucleus has the same number of neutrons and protons and is assumed as unpolarized. According to calculations, we find that only chiral-even terms survive and chiral-odd terms vanish in the differential cross section for this charged current deeply inelastic (anti-)neutrino nucleus scattering process. Furthermore, we introduce a universal measurable quantity, the yield asymmetry of the produced hadron $A^h$, to determine the muclear transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions. Numerical estimates show that the yield asymmetry is independent of the type of target nucleus if it has the same number of neutrons and protons. Numerical estimates also show that the isospin symmetry works very successfully in the $N=Z$ nuclei and sea quark distribution functions and disfavored fragmentation functions have significant influence on measurable quantities.

2024-11-27, **Gravitational atoms beyond the test field limit: The case of Sgr A* and ultralight dark matter**, Miguel Alcubierre et.al., [2411.18601v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18601v1)

 We construct gravitational atoms including self-gravity, obtaining solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations for a scalar field surrounding a non-rotating black hole in a quasi-stationary approximation. We resolve the region near the horizon as well as the far field region. Our results are relevant in a wide range of masses, from ultralight to MeV scalar fields and for black holes ranging from primordial to supermassive. For instance, a system with a scalar field consistent with ultralight dark matter and a black hole mass comparable to that of Sagittarius A* can be modeled. A density spike near the event horizon, although present, is negligible, contrasting with the prediction in [P. Gondolo and Silk, Phys. Rev. Lett., 83:1719-1722, 1999] for cold dark matter.

2024-11-27, **Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls**, Jim A. Enriquez et.al., [2411.18474v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18474v1)

 Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.

2024-11-27, **Central kpc of Andromeda. I. Dynamical modelling**, Lucie Cros et.al., [2411.18460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18460v1)

 The Andromeda galaxy (M31) is the most nearby giant spiral galaxy, an opportunity to study with high resolution dynamical phenomena occurring in nuclear disks and bulges, able to explain star formation quenching, and galaxy evolution through collisions and tides. Multi-wavelength data have revealed in the central kpc of M31 strong dynamical perturbations, with an off-centered tilted disk and ring, coinciding with a dearth of atomic and molecular gas. Our goal to understand the origin of these perturbations is to propose a dynamical model, reproducing the global features of the observations. We are reporting about integral field spectroscopy of the ionized gas with H$\alpha$ and [NII] obtained with SITELLE, the optical imaging Fourier transform spectrometer (IFTS) at the Canada France Hawaii telescope (CFHT). Using the fully sampled velocity field of ionized gas, together with the more patchy molecular gas velocity field, previously obtained with the CO lines at IRAM-30m telescope, and the dust photometry, we identify three dynamical components in the gas, the main disk, a tilted ring and a nuclear warped disk. A mass model of the central kpc is computed, essentially from the stellar nuclear disk and bulge, with small contributions of the main stellar and gaseous disk, and dark matter halo. The kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas is then computed in this potential, and the velocity field confronted to observations. The best fit helps to determine the physical parameters of the three identified gas components, size, morphology and geometrical orientation. The results are compatible with a recent head-on collision with a M-32 like galaxy, as previously proposed. The kinematical observations correspond to a dynamical re-orientation of the perturbed nuclear disk, through warps and tearing disk into ring, following the collision.

2024-11-27, **Detecting dilute axion stars constrained by fast radio bursts in the solar system via stimulated decay**, Haoran Di et.al., [2411.18378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18378v1)

 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be explained by collapsing axion stars, imposing constraints on the axion parameter space and providing valuable guidance for experimental axion searches. In the traditional post-inflationary model, axion stars could constitute up to $75\%$ of the dark matter component, suggesting that some axion stars may exist within the solar system. Electromagnetic radiation with an angular frequency equal to half the axion mass can stimulate axion decay. Thus, directing a powerful radio beam at an axion star could trigger its stimulated decay, producing a detectable echo. Using this method, we find it is possible to test the existence of dilute axion stars with maximum masses ranging from $6.21\times10^{-12}M\_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M\_\odot$, as constrained by FRBs, within the solar system. The resulting echo from axion stars constrained by FRBs could be detectable by terrestrial telescopes. Detecting such an echo would confirm the existence of axion stars, unravel the mystery of dark matter, and provide key evidence that some FRBs originate from collapsing axion stars. Furthermore, FRBs produced by axion star collapses could serve as standard candles, aiding in the resolution of the Hubble tension. If no echo is detected using this method, it would place constraints on the abundance of dark matter in the form of dilute axion stars with maximum masses in the range of $6.21\times10^{-12}M\_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M\_\odot$.

2024-11-27, **First characterisation of the MAGO cavity, a superconducting RF detector for kHz-MHz gravitational waves**, Lars Fischer et.al., [2411.18346v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18346v1)

 Heterodyne detection using microwave cavities is a promising method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves or ultralight axion dark matter. In this work, we report on studies conducted on a spherical 2-cell cavity developed by the MAGO collaboration for high-frequency gravitational waves detection. Although fabricated around 20 years ago, the cavity had not been used since. Due to deviations from the nominal geometry, we conducted a mechanical survey and performed room-temperature plastic tuning. Measurements and simulations of the mechanical resonances and electromagnetic properties were carried out, as these are critical for estimating the cavity's gravitational wave coupling potential. Based on these results, we plan further studies in a cryogenic environment. The cavity characterisation does not only provide valuable experience for a planned physics run but also informs the future development of improved cavity designs.

2024-11-27, **Interacting phantom dark energy: new accelerating scaling attractors**, Sudip Halder et.al., [2411.18300v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18300v1)

 We perform a detailed investigation of interacting phantom cosmology, by applying the powerful method of dynamical system analysis. We consider two well-studied interaction forms, namely one global and one local one, while the novel ingredient of our work is the examination of new potentials for the phantom field. Our analysis shows the existence of saddle matter-dominated points, stable dark-energy dominated points, and scaling accelerating solutions, that can attract the Universe at late times. As we show, some of the stable accelerating scaling attractors, in which dark matter and dark energy can co-exist, alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem, are totally new, even for the previously studied interaction rates, and arise purely from the novel potential forms.

2024-11-27, **Indefinitely flat rotation curves from Mpc sized charged cocoons**, Theodorus Maria Nieuwenhuizen et.al., [2411.18221v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18221v1)

 Weak lensing exhibits that rotation curves of isolated galaxies remain flat up to Mpc scale (Mistele et al, 2024). Recently we proposed that dark matter is a combination of electrostatic and vacuum energy in standard physics. In this theory, isolated galaxies may be embedded in ``charged cocoons'', spheres with $\pm 1/r^2$ charge density. The related circular rotation curves decay at the Mpc scale. The analytic solution is extended to the early Universe. A peak in the cosmic microwave background spectrum is expected at the arcsec scale. The induced nanometer size of the cocoons at the Big Bang makes the initial state inhomogeneous.

2024-11-27, **Heating the dark matter halo with dark radiation from supernovae**, Stefan Vogl et.al., [2411.18052v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18052v1)

 Supernova explosions are among the most extreme events in the Universe, making them a promising environment in which to search for the effects of light, weakly coupled new particles. As significant sources of energy, they are known to have an important effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter in their host galaxies but their potential impact on the dark matter (DM) halo remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the possibility that some fraction of the supernova energy is released via the form of dark radiation into the DM halo. Based on evaluation of energetics, we find that even a small fraction of the total SN energy is sufficient to change the overall shape of the DM halo and transform a cuspy halo into a cored one. This may help to explain the cores that are observed in some dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, one can interpret the upper limit on the size of a possible DM core as an upper limit on the energy that can go into light particles beyond the SM. These arguments are largely independent of a concrete model for the new physics. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the conditions we need, i.e.~significant supernova emissivity of dark radiation and the opacity of DM halo to the dark radiation, can be met in actual models. To demonstrate this, we study four simple benchmark models: the dark photon, dark Higgs, and gauged $B-L$ and $L\_\mu - L\_\tau$ models -- all provide light weakly coupled particles serving as the dark radiation. Assuming a sizable coupling of the dark radiation to DM, we find that all of the benchmark models have a significant part of the parameter space that meets the conditions. Interestingly, the couplings allowed by observations of SN1987A can have a significant effect on the halo of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

2024-11-27, **de Broglie scale time delays in pulsar networks for ultralight dark matter**, Andrew Eberhardt et.al., [2411.18051v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18051v1)

 The study of ultralight dark matter helps constrain the lower bound on minimally coupled dark matter models. The granular structure of ultralight dark matter density fields produces metric perturbations which have been identified as a potentially interesting probe of this model. For dark matter masses $m \gtrsim 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ these perturbations would fluctuate on timescales similar to observational timescales. In this paper, we estimate the expected time delay these fluctuations would generate in simulated pulsar signals. We simulate arrays of mock pulsars in a fluctuating granular density field. We calculate the expected Shapiro time delay and gravitational redshift and compare analytical estimates with the results of simulations. Finally, we provide a comparison with existing pulsar observation sensitivities.

2024-11-27, **Identifying dark matter signals by the radio continuum spectral data of the cool-core cluster RX J1720.1+2638**, Man Ho Chan et.al., [2411.17977v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17977v1)

 Investigating the signals of dark matter annihilation is one of the most popular ways to understand the nature of dark matter. In particular, many recent studies are focussing on using radio data to examine the possible signals of dark matter revealed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. In this article, we investigate on the spectral data of the central radio halo of the cool-core cluster RX J1720.1+2638. We show that the radio spectral data can be best accounted by the synchrotron emission due to dark matter annihilation via $\tau$ lepton channel (with dark matter mass $m=15$ GeV) or $b$ quark channel (with dark matter mass $m=110$ GeV), although using the very coarse spectral data with notable errors. Despite the fact that cosmic-ray emission can also provide a good explanation for the observed radio spectrum, our results suggest a possible positive evidence for dark matter annihilation revealed in the form of radio emission in RX J1720.1+2638 cluster.

 In modern cosmology, the discovery of the Universe's accelerated expansion has significantly transformed our understanding of cosmic evolution and expansion history. The unknown properties of dark energy, the driver of this acceleration, have not only prompted extensive studies on its nature but also spurred interest in modified gravity theories that might serve as alternatives. In this paper, we adopt a bumblebee vector-tensor modified gravity theory to model the cosmic expansion history and derive predictions for the Hubble parameter. We constrain the bumblebee model parameters using observational data from established probes, including the Pantheon+ SH0ES Type Ia Supernovae and BAO measurements from DESI DR1, as well as recently included Cosmic Chronometers and Gamma Ray Bursts data. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of Bayesian posterior distribution enables us to rigorously constrain the bumblebee model and compare it with the standard LCDM cosmology. Our results indicate that the bumblebee theory provides a compatible fit with current observational data across a range of its parameters, suggesting it as a viable alternative to the LCDM model.

2024-11-27, **The importance of binary stars**, Henri M. J. Boffin et.al., [2411.18470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18470v1)

 Stars are mostly found in binary and multiple systems, as at least 50% of all solar-like stars have companions - a fraction that goes up to 100% for the most massive stars. Moreover, a large fraction of them will interact in some way or another over the course of their lives. Such interactions can, and often will, alter the structure and evolution of both components in the system. This will, in turn, lead to the production of exotic objects whose existence cannot be explained by standard single star evolution models, including gravitational wave progenitors, blue stragglers, symbiotic and barium stars, novae, and supernovae. More generally, binary stars prove crucial in many aspects, ranging from cultural ones, to constraining models of stellar evolution, star formation, and even, possibly, of gravity itself. They also provide a quasi-model independent way to determine stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. We here provide a brief summary of the importance of binary stars.

2024-11-27, **Exclusion of a direct progenitor detection for the Type Ic SN 2017ein based on late-time observations**, Yi-Han Zhao et.al., [2411.17969v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17969v1)

 To date, SN 2017ein is the only Type Ic supernova with a directly identified progenitor candidate. This candidate points to a very massive ($>$45 $M\_\odot$) Wolf-Rayet progenitor, but its disappearance after the explosion of SN 2017ein remains unconfirmed. In this work, we revisit SN 2017ein in late-time images acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at 2.4--3.8 yrs after peak brightness. We find this source has not disappeared and its brightness and color remain almost the same as in the pre-explosion images. Thus, we conclude that the pre-explosion source is not the genuine progenitor of SN 2017ein. We exclude the possibility that it is a companion star of the progenitor, since it has a much lower extinction than SN 2017ein; its color is also inconsistent with a star cluster, indicated by the newly added magnitude limit in F336W, apart from F555W and F814W. We suggest, therefore, this source is an unrelated star in chance alignment with SN 2017ein. Based on the low ejecta mass, we propose that SN 2017ein is most likely originated from a moderately massive star with $M\_{\rm ini}$ $\sim$ 8--20 $M\_\odot$, stripped by binary interaction, rather than a very massive Wolf-Rayet progenitor.
