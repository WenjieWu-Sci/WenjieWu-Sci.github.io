2023-04-17, **Big Bang initial conditions and self-interacting hidden dark matter**, Jinzheng Li et.al., [2304.08454v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08454v1)

 A variety of supergravity and string models involve hidden sectors where the hidden sectors may couple feebly with the visible sectors via a variety of portals. While the coupling of the hidden sector to the visible sector is feeble its coupling to the inflaton is largely unknown. It could couple feebly or with the same strength as the visible sector which would result in either a cold or a hot hidden sector at the end of reheating. These two possibilities could lead to significantly different outcomes for observables. We investigate the thermal evolution of the two sectors in a cosmologically consistent hidden sector dark matter model where the hidden sector and the visible sector are thermally coupled and their thermal evolution occurs without the assumption of separate entropy conservation for each sector. Within this framework we analyze several phenomena to illustrate their dependence on the initial conditions. These include the allowed parameter space of models, dark matter relic density, proton-dark matter cross section, effective massless neutrino species at BBN time, self-interacting dark matter cross-section, where self-interaction occurs via exchange of dark photon, and Sommerfeld enhancement. Finally fits to the velocity dependence of dark matter cross sections from galaxy scales to the scale of galaxy clusters is given. The analysis indicates significant effects of the initial conditions on the observables listed above. The analysis is carried out within the framework where dark matter is constituted of dark fermions and the mediation between the visible and the hidden sector occurs via the exchange of dark photons. The techniques discussed here may have applications for a wider class of hidden sector models using different mediations between the visible and the hidden sectors to explore the impact of Big Bang initial conditions on observable physics.

2023-04-17, **Low Seesaw Scale Solution for $M_W$ and $(g-2)_μ$**, A. de Giorgi et.al., [2304.08438v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08438v1)

 In this short talk, we present a renormalizable model that can i) generate neutrino masses via a low-scale seesaw mechanism and ii) solve the long-standing $(g-2)\_\mu$ and the more recent CDF II $M\_W$-anomalies. This is minimally achieved by introducing two sterile neutrinos and a single electroweak-doublet vector-like lepton, with masses $< 2$ TeV. We focus on the one-generation scenario and the requirements to extend it to three generations.

2023-04-17, **NvDEx-100 Conceptual Design Report**, X. Cao et.al., [2304.08362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08362v1)

 The measurement of nuclear neutrinoless double-beta decay would be a revolutionary result in particle physics. The observation of such a decay would prove that the neutrinos are their own antiparticles, help to study the absolute mass of neutrinos, explore the origin of their mass, and may explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in our universe by the violation of lepton number. We propose to develop a time projection chamber (TPC) using high-pressure 82SeF6 gas and the top-metal silicon sensors for read-out in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of 82Se, called the NvDEx experiment. Besides located at CJPL with world's deepest rock shielding, NvDEx combines the advantages of the high Q value (2.996 MeV) of 82Se and TPC's ability to distinguish signal and background events using their different topological characteristics. These give NvDEx unique and great potential for low background and high sensitivity. NvDEx-100, the NvDEx experiment phase with 100 kg of SeF6 gas, is being built and planned to complete with installation at CJPL around year 2025. This report will introduce the neutrinoless double-beta decay physics, NvDEx concept and its advantages, the schematic design of NvDEx-100 and its sub-systems, as well as the background and sensitivity estimation for it.

2023-04-17, **Constraints on NJL four-fermion effective interactions from neutrinoless double beta decay**, Luca Pacioselli et.al., [2304.08042v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08042v1)

 We study the contribution of a heavy right-handed Majorana neutrino to neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) via four-fermion effective interactions of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type. In this physical scenario, the sterile neutrino contributes to the nuclear transition through gauge, contact, and mixed interactions. Using the lower limit on the half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ from the KamLAND-Zen experiment, we then constrain the effective right-handed coupling between the sterile neutrino and the $W$ boson: $\mathcal{G}^{W}\_{R}$. Eventually, we show that the obtained bounds are compatible with those found in the literature, which highlights the complementarity of this type of phenomenological study with high-energy experiments.

2023-04-17, **Revisiting the Lithium abundance problem in Big-Bang nucleosynthesis**, Vinay Singh et.al., [2304.08032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08032v1)

 One of the three testaments in favor of the big bang theory is the prediction of the primordial elemental abundances in the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). The Standard BBN is a parameter-free theory due to the precise knowledge of the baryon-to-photon ratio of the Universe obtained from studies of the anisotropies of cosmic microwave background radiation. Although the computed abundances of light elements during primordial nucleosynthesis and those determined from observations are in good agreement throughout a range of nine orders of magnitude, there is still a disparity of $^7$Li abundance overestimated by a factor of $\sim 2.5$ when calculated theoretically. The number of light neutrino flavors, the neutron lifetime and the baryon-to-photon ratio in addition to the astrophysical nuclear reaction rates determine the primordial abundances. We previously looked into the impact of updating baryon-to-photon ratio and neutron lifetime and changing quite a few reaction rates on the yields of light element abundances in BBN. In this work, calculations are performed using new reaction rates for $^3$H(p,$\gamma$)$^4$He, $^6$Li(p,$\gamma$)$^7$Be, $^7$Be(p,$\gamma$)$^8$B, $^{13}$N(p,$\gamma$)$^{14}$O, $^7$Li(n,$\gamma$)$^8$Li and $^{11}$B(n,$\gamma$)$^{12}$B along with the latest measured value of neutron lifetime. We observe from theoretical calculations that these changes result in marginal improvement over a sizable twelve percent reduction in the abundance of $^7$Li achieved earlier.

2023-04-17, **Grand unification, small vs large representations, hadron colliders and all that**, Goran Senjanović et.al., [2304.07932v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07932v1)

 We review minimal realistic grand unified models based on $SU(5)$ and $SO(10)$ gauge groups. The models with small Higgs representations and higher dimensional operators - under the assumption of no cancellations in proton decay amplitudes - predict nearby oases with new light particles. Two of them stand out: real fermion and scalar weak triplets. The former generates dynamically neutrino Majorana mass through the so-called type III seesaw mechanism, while the latter naturally gets a small vacuum expectation value and thus generically modifies $W$-boson mass. On the contrary, the renormalisable versions of these theories fail to determine the particle spectra. In particular, in the renormalisable version of the $SO(10)$ theory the mass of the right-handed gauge boson - normally assumed (and allowed) to lie far in the desert - could be even accessible at the LHC. Last but not least, we show that in the minimal supersymmetric $SU(5)$ theory all the superpartners can lie orders of magnitude above the weak scale, unless one requires strict naturalness. Thus, the so-called split supersymmetry does not imply any light states.

2023-04-17, **Effective electric field: quantifying the sensitivity of searches for new P,T-odd physics with EuCl$_3\cdot$6H$_2$O**, Alexander O. Sushkov et.al., [2304.08461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08461v1)

 Laboratory-scale precision experiments are a promising approach to searching for physics beyond the standard model. Non-centrosymmetric solids offer favorable statistical sensitivity for efforts that search for new fields, whose interactions violate the discrete parity and time-reversal symmetries. One example is the electric Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment (CASPEr-e), which is sensitive to the defining interaction of the QCD axion dark matter with gluons in atomic nuclei. The effective electric field is the parameter that quantifies the sensitivity of such experiments to new physics. We describe the theoretical approach to calculating the effective electric field for non-centrosymmetric sites in ionic insulating solids. We consider the specific example of the EuCl$\_3\cdot$6H$\_2$O crystal, which is a particularly promising material. The optimistic estimate of the effective electric field for the $^{153}$Eu isotope in this crystal is 10 MV/cm. The calculation uncertainty is estimated to be two orders of magnitude, dominated by the evaluation of the Europium nuclear Schiff moment.

2023-04-17, **A first application of machine and deep learning for background rejection in the ALPS II TES detector**, Manuel Meyer et.al., [2304.08406v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08406v1)

 Axions and axion-like particles are hypothetical particles predicted in extensions of the standard model and are promising cold dark matter candidates. The Any Light Particle Search (ALPS II) experiment is a light-shining-through-the-wall experiment that aims to produce these particles from a strong light source and magnetic field and subsequently detect them through a reconversion into photons. With an expected rate $\sim$ 1 photon per day, a sensitive detection scheme needs to be employed and characterized. One foreseen detector is based on a transition edge sensor (TES). Here, we investigate machine and deep learning algorithms for the rejection of background events recorded with the TES. We also present a first application of convolutional neural networks to classify time series data measured with the TES.

2023-04-17, **Search for gravitational-lensing signatures in the full third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo network**, The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et.al., [2304.08393v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08393v1)

 Gravitational lensing by massive objects along the line of sight to the source causes distortions of gravitational wave-signals; such distortions may reveal information about fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics. In this work, we have extended the search for lensing signatures to all binary black hole events from the third observing run of the LIGO--Virgo network. We search for repeated signals from strong lensing by 1) performing targeted searches for subthreshold signals, 2) calculating the degree of overlap amongst the intrinsic parameters and sky location of pairs of signals, 3) comparing the similarities of the spectrograms amongst pairs of signals, and 4) performing dual-signal Bayesian analysis that takes into account selection effects and astrophysical knowledge. We also search for distortions to the gravitational waveform caused by 1) frequency-independent phase shifts in strongly lensed images, and 2) frequency-dependent modulation of the amplitude and phase due to point masses. None of these searches yields significant evidence for lensing. Finally, we use the non-detection of gravitational-wave lensing to constrain the lensing rate based on the latest merger-rate estimates and the fraction of dark matter composed of compact objects.

2023-04-17, **Exotic Image Formation in Strong Gravitational Lensing by Clusters of Galaxies -- IV. Elliptical NFW Lenses and Hyperbolic Umbilics**, Ashish Kumar Meena et.al., [2304.08326v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08326v1)

 A source lying near hyperbolic umbilic (HU) leads to a ring-like image formation, constituting four images with high magnification factors and lying in a small region of the lens plane. Since (based on our earlier work) the observed number of HU image formations in cluster lenses is expected to increase in future, it is timely to investigate them in more detail. Like fold and cusp, HU also satisfies the magnification relation, i.e., the signed magnification sum of the four images equals zero. This work presents a detailed study of HU magnification relation ($R\_{\rm hu}$) considering the elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White (eNFW) lens profile suitable for cluster scale dark matter halos. Our results show that for an isolated eNFW lens, $R\_{\rm hu}$ is more sensitive to ellipticity than its mass or concentration parameter. An ellipticity greater than 0.3 results in $R\_{\rm hu}$ lying close to zero with a small scatter around it. A substructure near the HU image formation causes the average $R\_{\rm hu}$ value to deviate from zero and increases the scatter, with the amount of deviation depending on the image type near which the substructure lies. However, a population of substructures in the lens plane (equivalent to the galaxy lenses inside the cluster) does not significantly shift the average $R\_{\rm hu}$ value from zero but increases the scatter around it. We find that $R\_{\rm hu} \simeq 0$ for HU image formation in the Abell 1703 cluster. Repeating this test in other clusters where HU formations are discovered can be a useful indicator of substructure in cluster halos.

2023-04-17, **Outflows in the Gaseous Discs of Active Galaxies and their impact on Black Hole Scaling Relations**, N. Menci et.al., [2304.08273v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08273v1)

 To tackle the still unsolved and fundamental problem of the role of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback in shaping galaxies, in this work we implement a new physical treatment of AGN-driven winds into our semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. To each galaxy in our model, we associate solutions for the outflow expansion and the mass outflow rates in different directions, depending on the AGN luminosity, on the circular velocity of the host halo, and on gas content of the considered galaxy. To each galaxy we also assign an effective radius derived from energy conservation during merger events, and a stellar velocity dispersion self-consistently computed via Jeans modelling. We derive all the main scaling relations between Black hole (BH) mass and total/bulge stellar mass, velocity dispersion, host halo dark matter mass, and star formation efficiency. We find that our improved AGN feedback mostly controls the dispersion around the relations but plays a subdominant role in shaping slopes and/or normalizations of the scaling relations. Including possible limited-resolution selection biases in the model provides better agreement with the available data. The model does not point to any more fundamental galactic property linked to BH mass, with velocity dispersion playing a similar role with respect to stellar mass, in tension with present data. In line with other independent studies carried out on comprehensive semi-analytic and hydrodynamic galaxy-BH evolution models, our current results signal either an inadequacy of present cosmological models of galaxy formation in fully reproducing the local scaling relations, in terms of both shape and residuals, and/or point to an incompleteness issue affecting the local sample of dynamically-measured BHs.

2023-04-17, **Prospects for annihilating dark matter from M31 and M33 observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array**, Miltiadis Michailidis et.al., [2304.08202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08202v1)

 M31 and M33 are the closest spiral galaxies and the largest members (together with the Milky Way) of the Local group, which makes them interesting targets for indirect dark matter searches. In this paper we present studies of the expected sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) to an annihilation signal from weakly interacting massive particles from M31 and M33. We show that a 100 h long observation campaign will allow CTA to probe annihilation cross-sections up to $\langle\sigma\upsilon\rangle\approx 5\cdot10^{-25}~\mathrm{cm^{3}s^{-1}}$ for the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ annihilation channel (for M31, at a DM mass of 0.3 TeV), improving the current limits derived by HAWC by up to an order of magnitude. We present an estimate of the expected CTA sensitivity, by also taking into account the contributions of the astrophysical background and other possible sources of systematic uncertainty. We also show that CTA might be able to detect the extended emission from the bulge of M31, detected at lower energies by the Fermi/LAT.

2023-04-17, **The Universe is worth $64^3$ pixels: Convolution Neural Network and Vision Transformers for Cosmology**, Se Yeon Hwang et.al., [2304.08192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08192v1)

 We present a novel approach for estimating cosmological parameters, $\Omega\_m$, $\sigma\_8$, $w\_0$, and one derived parameter, $S\_8$, from 3D lightcone data of dark matter halos in redshift space covering a sky area of $40^\circ \times 40^\circ$ and redshift range of $0.3 < z < 0.8$, binned to $64^3$ voxels. Using two deep learning algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT), we compare their performance with the standard two-point correlation (2pcf) function. Our results indicate that CNN yields the best performance, while ViT also demonstrates significant potential in predicting cosmological parameters. By combining the outcomes of Vision Transformer, Convolution Neural Network, and 2pcf, we achieved a substantial reduction in error compared to the 2pcf alone. To better understand the inner workings of the machine learning algorithms, we employed the Grad-CAM method to investigate the sources of essential information in activation maps of the CNN and ViT. Our findings suggest that the algorithms focus on different parts of the density field and redshift depending on which parameter they are predicting. This proof-of-concept work paves the way for incorporating deep learning methods to estimate cosmological parameters from large-scale structures, potentially leading to tighter constraints and improved understanding of the Universe.

2023-04-16, **Dark matter search with CMB: a study of foregrounds**, Zi-Xuan Zhang et.al., [2304.07793v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07793v1)

 The energy injected from dark matter annihilation and decay processes potentially raises the ionisation of the intergalactic medium and leaves visible footprints on the anisotropy maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Galactic foregrounds emission in the microwave bands contaminate the CMB measurement and may affect the search for dark matter's signature. In this paper, we construct a full CMB data and foreground simulation based on the design of the next-generation ground-based CMB experiments. The foreground residual after the components separation on maps is fully considered in our data analysis, accounting for various contamination from the emission of synchrotron, thermal dust, free-free and spinning dust. We analyse the corresponding sensitivity on dark matter parameters from the temperature and polarization maps, and we find that the CMB foregrounds leave a non-zero yet controllable impact on the sensitivity. Comparing with statistics-only analysis, the CMB foreground residual leads to a factor of 7%-23% weakening on energy-injection constraints, depending on the specific dark matter process and experimental configuration. Strong limits on dark matter annihilation rate and decay lifetime can be expected after foreground subtraction.

2023-04-16, **The role of impact parameter in typical close galaxy flybys**, A. Mitrašinović et.al., [2304.07751v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07751v1)

 Close galaxy flybys, interactions during which two galaxies inter-penetrate, are frequent and can significantly affect the evolution of individual galaxies. Equal-mass flybys are extremely rare and almost exclusively distant, while frequent flybys have mass ratios 0.1 or lower, with a secondary galaxy penetrating deep into the primary. This can result in comparable strengths of interaction S between the two classes of flybys and lead to essentially the same effects. To demonstrate this, emphasize and explore the role of the impact parameter $b$, we performed a series of N-body simulations of flybys with varying relative $b$ ranging from 0.114 to 0.272 of the virial radius of the primary. Two-armed spirals form during flybys, with radii of origin correlated with $b$ and strengths well approximated with an inverted S-curve. The impact parameter does not affect the shape of induced spirals, and the lifetimes of a distinguished spiral structure appear to be constant, 2 Gyr. Bars, with strengths anti-correlated with $b$, form after the encounter is over in simulations with interaction strengths $S\geq0.076$, but they are short-lived except for the stronger ones with $S\geq0.129$. We showcase an occurrence of double bar that survives for a long time in one of the simulations. Effects on the pre-existing bar instability are diverse. There is no uniform correlation between these effects and $b$, as they are secondary effects, happening later in a post-flyby stage. Bulges are resilient to flybys, while dark matter halos can significantly spin up in the amount anti-correlated with $b$. There is an offset angle between the angular momentum vector of the dark matter halo and that of a disc, and it correlates linearly with b. Flybys remain an important pathway for structural evolution within galaxies in the local Universe.

2023-04-16, **Stability of galaxies across morphological sequence**, K. Aditya et.al., [2304.07734v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07734v1)

 We investigate the stability of nearby disc galaxies and galaxies at redshift ($z$) equal to 4.5. We explore the connection between the stability parameter $(Q\_{RW})$, star formation rate ($SFR$), gas fraction $(f^{Gas})$, and the time scale for growth of gravitational instabilities $(\tau)$. We find that, despite differences in morphology $91$ $\%$ of the nearby galaxies have a minimum value of stability parameter ($Q^{Min}\_{RW}$) greater than $1$ indicating stability against the growth of axisymmetric instabilities. The spirals in our sample have higher median star formation rate, lower median $Q\_{RW}$, a lower $f^{Gas}$ and small time scale for growth of gravitational instabilities than irregular galaxies. We find that the gravitational instabilities in spirals convert a large fraction of gas into stars quickly, depleting the gas reservoirs. On the other hand, star formation occurs more gradually over longer timescales in irregulars with a higher gas fraction. We then compare the stability of the nearby galaxies with galaxies at $z\,=\,4.5$. We find that net stability levels in the nearby galaxies and the galaxies at $z\,=\,4.5$ are primarily driven by the stellar disc suggesting the presence of an inherent mechanism that self-regulates the stability. Finally, upon removing the contribution of the dark matter to the total potential, the median $Q\_{RW}$ for the nearby galaxies and galaxies at $z \,= \,4.5$ remains unchanged indicating that the baryons can self-regulate the stability levels, at least in a statistical sense.

2023-04-17, **Detached and Continuous Circumstellar Matter in Type Ibc Supernovae from Mass Eruption**, Daichi Tsuna et.al., [2304.08378v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08378v1)

 Some hydrogen-poor supernovae (SNe) are found to undergo interaction with dense circumstellar matter (CSM) that may originate from mass eruption(s) just prior to core-collapse. We model the interaction between the remaining star and the bound part of the erupted CSM that eventually fall back to the star. We find that while fallback initially results in a continuous CSM down to the star, feedback processes from the star can push the CSM to large radii of $\gtrsim 10^{15}$ cm from several years after the eruption. In the latter case, a tenuous bubble surrounded by a dense and detached CSM extending to $\gtrsim 10^{16}$ cm is expected. Our model offers a natural unifying explanation for the diverse CSM structures seen in hydrogen-poor SNe, such as Type Ibn/Icn SNe that show CSM signatures soon after explosion, and the recently discovered Type Ic SNe 2021ocs and 2022xxf ("the Bactrian") with CSM signatures seen only at late times.

2023-04-16, **MASTER OT J055845.55+391533.4: SU UMa star with a dip and long rebrightening**, Taichi Kato et.al., [2304.07695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07695v1)

 We analyzed Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) data of MASTER OT J055845.55+391533.4 and found that this object repeats superoutburst with a dip in the middle of the outburst followed by long and sometimes oscillating rebrightening, just like a WZ Sge-type dwarf nova or an AM CVn-type object. The mean supercycle was 298(8) d, too short for a WZ Sge star, but with only a few normal outbursts. We also observed the 2023 February-March superoutburst and established the superhump period of 0.05509(2) d. This period appears to exclude the possibility of an AM CVn star. Although the 2023 observations could not detect superhumps after the dip, the 2014, 2016 and 2021 data seem to suggest that low-amplitude superhumps were present during the rebrightening phase. We note that a dip during a superoutburst is a feature common to the unusual SU UMa-type dwarf nova MASTER OT J172758.09+380021.5 during some of its superoutbursts. These objects may comprise a new class of rebrightening phenomenon in SU UMa-type dwarf novae.
