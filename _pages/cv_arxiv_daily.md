2025-03-27, **Transitioning to Memory Burden: Detectable Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter**, Gia Dvali et.al., [2503.21740v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21740v1)

 Mounting theoretical evidence suggests that black holes are subjected to the memory burden effect, implying that after certain time the information stored in them suppresses the decay rate. This effect opens up a new window for small primordial black holes (PBHs) below $10^{15}\,{\rm g}$ as dark matter. We show that the smooth transition from semi-classical evaporation to the memory-burdened phase strongly impacts observational bounds on the abundance of small PBHs. The most stringent constraints come from present-day fluxes of astrophysical particles. Remarkably, currently-transitioning small PBHs are detectable through high-energetic neutrino events.

2025-03-27, **SBN@CERN: A short-baseline neutrino beam at CERN for high-precision cross-section measurements**, F. Acerbi et.al., [2503.21589v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21589v1)

 A new generation of neutrino cross-section experiments at the GeV scale is crucial in the precision era of oscillation physics and lepton flavor studies. In this document, we present a novel neutrino beam design that leverages the experience and R&D achievements of the NP06/ENUBET and NuTag Collaborations and explore its potential implementation at CERN. This beam enables flux monitoring at the percent level and provides a neutrino energy measurement independent of final state particle reconstruction at the neutrino detector. As a result, it eliminates the two primary sources of systematic uncertainty in cross-section measurements: flux normalization and energy bias caused by nuclear effects. We provide a detailed description of the beam technology and instrumentation, along with an overview of its physics potential, with particular emphasis on cross-sections relevant to DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande.

2025-03-27, **Exploring the flavor structure of leptons via diffusion models**, Satsuki Nishimura et.al., [2503.21432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21432v1)

 We propose a method to explore the flavor structure of leptons using diffusion models, which are known as one of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI). We consider a simple extension of the Standard Model with the type I seesaw mechanism and train a neural network to generate the neutrino mass matrix. By utilizing transfer learning, the diffusion model generates 104 solutions that are consistent with the neutrino mass squared differences and the leptonic mixing angles. The distributions of the CP phases and the sums of neutrino masses, which are not included in the conditional labels but are calculated from the solutions, exhibit non-trivial tendencies. In addition, the effective mass in neutrinoless double beta decay is concentrated near the boundaries of the existing confidence intervals, allowing us to verify the obtained solutions through future experiments. An inverse approach using the diffusion model is expected to facilitate the experimental verification of flavor models from a perspective distinct from conventional analytical methods.

2025-03-27, **The Jiutian simulations for the CSST extra-galactic surveys**, Jiaxin Han et.al., [2503.21368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21368v1)

 We provide an overview of the Jiutian simulations, a hybrid simulation suite for the China Space Survey Telescope (CSST) extragalactic surveys. It consists of four complementary modules: the primary runs with high resolutions under the fiducial concordance cosmology, the emulator runs exploring the parameter uncertainties around the fiducial cosmology, the reconstruction runs intended for recovering the observed Universe site by site, and the extension runs employing extended cosmologies beyond the standard model. For the primary runs, two independent pipelines are adopted to construct subhaloes and merger trees. On top of them, four sets of mock galaxy light-cone catalogs are produced from semi-analytical models and subhalo abundance matching, providing a variety of observational properties including galaxy SED, emission lines, lensing distortions, and mock images. The 129 emulator runs are used to train the CSST emulator, achieving one percent accuracy in predicting a variety of cosmological statistics over $k\leq 10 h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $z\leq 2$. The reconstruction runs employ a number of subgrid baryonic models to predict the evolution and galaxy population of certain regions in the real Universe with constrained initial conditions, enabling controlled investigation of galaxy formation on top of structure formation. The extension runs cover models with warm dark matter, $f(R)$ gravity, interacting dark energy, and nonzero neutrino masses, revealing differences in the cosmic structure under alternative cosmological models. We introduce the specifications for each run, the data products derived from them, the corresponding pipeline developments, and present some main tests. Using the primary runs, we also show that the subhalo peak mass functions of different levels are approximately universal. These simulations form a comprehensive and open library for the CSST surveys.

2025-03-27, **Beautiful Majorana Higgses at Colliders**, Benjamin Fuks et.al., [2503.21354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21354v1)

 We investigate a novel collider signature within the minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model, featuring a Higgs sector composed of a bi-doublet and two triplets. Our study focuses on a region of the parameter space where the $SU(2)\_R$ charged gauge boson $W\_R$ lies in the multi-TeV regime (3-100 TeV) and the additional Higgs states play a significant role. In this scenario, a heavy neutral Higgs boson $\Delta$ with a dominant $SU(2)\_R$ triplet component can be produced in association with either a Standard Model Higgs boson or a massive weak boson. The subsequent decay of the heavy Higgs into Majorana neutrinos $N$ results in displaced lepton signatures, providing a striking manifestation of lepton number violation. Additionally, we explore how the production of $b$-jets in these processes can enhance hadron-collider sensitivity to such signals. A particularly compelling channel, $pp \to b \bar b NN$, offers the exciting possibility of simultaneously probing the spontaneous mass origin of both Dirac fermions and Majorana states. Based on an optimised event selection strategy and state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations, we outline the expected reach at the HL-LHC and future colliders. Our findings demonstrate that this channel probes a region of parameter space where the neutral Higgs triplet and heavy neutrino masses are relatively light ($m\_\Delta \lesssim 250$ GeV, $m\_N \lesssim 80$ GeV), indirectly constraining the $W\_R$ boson to the deep multi-TeV domain, with sensitivity extending up to 70-80 TeV, effectively turning the LHC into a precision machine.

2025-03-27, **Neutrino type identification for atmospheric neutrinos in a large homogeneous liquid scintillation detector**, Jiaxi Liu et.al., [2503.21353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21353v1)

 Atmospheric neutrino oscillations are important to the study of neutrino properties, including the neutrino mass ordering problem. A good capability to identify neutrinos' flavor and neutrinos against antineutrinos is crucial in such measurements. In this paper, we present a machine-learning-based approach for identifying atmospheric neutrino events in a large homogeneous liquid scintillator detector. This method extracts features that reflect event topologies from PMT waveforms and uses them as input to machine learning models. In addition, neutron-capture information is utilized to achieve neutrino versus antineutrino discrimination. Preliminary performances based on Monte Carlo simulations are presented, which demonstrate such detector's potential in the future measurements of atmospheric neutrinos.

2025-03-27, **Neutrino Theory Overview**, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., [2503.21212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21212v1)

 The neutrino sector is the least known in the Standard Model. We briefly review the open questions in neutrino physics and the future experimental prospects of answering them. We argue that a synergistic approach at multiple frontiers is needed.

2025-03-26, **Evidence for Cosmological Massive Neutrinos**, Deng Wang et.al., [2503.21026v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21026v1)

 A key question in cosmology is whether massive neutrinos exist on cosmic scales. Current cosmological observations have severely compressed the viable range for neutrino masses and even prefer phenomenologically an effective negative mass. This poses a great challenge to the cosmological search for neutrinos. Based on current background and large scale structure data, taking a full redshift and/or scale tomography method, we find one beyond $5\,\sigma$, two $3\,\sigma$ and two $2\,\sigma$ evidences of massive neutrinos, spanning both high and low redshifts, as well as both small and intermediate scales. Interestingly, these five neutrino masses are well consistent within $1\,\sigma$ confidence level, indicating a possible suppression of neutrino mass during the evolution of the universe. Using cosmic microwave background observations to constrain a redshift and scale dependent neutrino mass, we make the first neutrino mass map through the cosmic history and full scales for future high precision search.

2025-03-26, **Squeezing Proton Decay and Neutrino Masses: Upper Bounds on Standard Model Extensions**, Arnau Bas i Beneito et.al., [2503.20928v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20928v1)

 Baryon and lepton number are excellent low-energy symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) that tightly constrain the form of its extensions. In this paper we investigate the possibility that these accidental symmetries are violated in the deep UV, in such a way that one multiplet necessary for their violation lives at an intermediate energy scale $M$ above the electroweak scale. We write down the simplest effective operators containing each multiplet that may couple linearly to the SM at the renormalisable level and estimate the dominant contribution of the underlying UV model to the pertinent operators in the SMEFT: the dimension-5 Weinberg operator and the baryon-number-violating operators up to dimension 7. Our results are upper bounds on the scale $M$ for each multiplet--operator pair, derived from neutrino-oscillation data as well as prospective nucleon-decay searches. We also analyse the possibility that both processes are simultaneously explained within a natural UV model. In addition, we advocate that our framework provides a convenient and digestible way of organising the space of UV models that violate these symmetries.

2025-03-26, **From SIMP miracles to WIMP dead ends: navigating the freeze out of MeV-mass dark matter**, Xiaoyong Chu et.al., [2503.20911v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20911v1)

 We summarize here our studies \cite{Chu:2022xuh,Chu:2023jyb,Chu:2024rrv} on two distinct scenarios for MeV-mass thermal dark matter freeze-out. First, we determine the minimal viable mass for dark matter below tens of MeV, considering annihilation into Standard Model particles, including photons, electrons, and neutrinos. Using a full three-sector abundance calculation, we track heat transfer between sectors and provide accurate thermal annihilation cross sections, particularly for velocity-dependent cases. The results identify fine-tuned regions where neutrino final states permit otherwise excluded p-wave annihilation scenarios. Second, we examine dark matter freeze-out in strongly interacting theories, where the relic abundance can be regulated not only through standard $3\pi \to 2\pi$ annihilation but also via bound-state formation $X$, enabling effective two-body processes $XX \to \pi \pi$ and/or $\pi X \to \pi \pi$. Together, these studies highlight complementary pathways to thermal MeV-mass dark matter.

2025-03-26, **Nuclear recoil detection with color centers in bulk lithium fluoride**, Gabriela A. Araujo et.al., [2503.20732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20732v1)

 We present initial results on nuclear recoil detection based on the fluorescence of color centers created by nuclear recoils in lithium fluoride. We use gamma rays, fast and thermal neutrons, and study the difference in responses they induce, showing that this type of detector is rather insensitive to gamma rays. We use light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to image nuclear recoil tracks from fast and thermal neutron interactions deep inside a cubic-centimeter sized crystal and demonstrate automated feature extraction in three dimensions using machine learning tools. The number, size, and topology of the events agree with expectations based on simulations with TRIM. These results constitute the first step towards 10-1000g scale detectors with single-event sensitivity for applications such as the detection of dark matter particles, reactor neutrinos, and neutrons.

2025-03-26, **The core software and simulation activities for data analysis at the Pierre Auger Observatory**, Eva Santos et.al., [2503.20650v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20650v1)

 The Pierre Auger Observatory, located near the town Malarg\"ue in the province of Mendoza, Argentina, is the largest cosmic-ray detector in existence, covering an area of 3000 km2. The upgraded Observatory, in Phase II of operations, consists of a surface array of 1660 stations combining water Cherenkov, scintillator, and radio detectors. A subset of stations also includes underground muon detectors. Additionally, fluorescence detectors located at four sites overlook the array. The science goals for the enhanced Observatory include the measurement of the properties of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with large statistics and high sensitivity to the primary composition. The Observatory is also sensitive to photons and neutrinos at the highest energies, allowing it to participate in multi-messenger studies. The Auger Offline Framework provides the tools to perform detailed simulations, using the Geant 4 toolkit, of all components of the Observatory and the analysis of both data and simulated events. It proved to have the flexibility needed to evolve during the lifetime of the Observatory, to accommodate new sub-detectors and, recently, changes to the station readout electronics. A new challenge is interfacing the framework with Machine Learning tools for both the development and execution of neural-network-based algorithms. Independent of the framework, CORSIKA 7 is used to simulate particles, fluorescence light, and radio signals produced by air showers. The production of simulations is coordinated centrally to provide standard libraries for analyses and to optimize the use of computing resources. We will describe the evolution and status of the Offline Framework and the tools used to coordinate the simulation efforts. We will also discuss the challenges of the massive simulation efforts and the resources consumed to provide the simulation libraries required by the Collaboration.

2025-03-26, **To detect strong nugget with an acoustic array**, Haoyang Qi et.al., [2503.20597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20597v1)

 This article discusses strong nuggets (SNs) which means strong interaction condensed matter clusters with a mass of about $10^6\,$g. They may originate from the early universe, supernova, pulsar merger event, and so on. Depending on the equation of state, the SNs could be stable and even be one of the candidates for dark matter. In order to detect SNs which hitting the Earth or the Moon at a non-relativistic velocity, a new messenger, the acoustic array, is analysed. The results of the calculations show that the impact signal of an SN can be detected at a distance of about 30 kilometers from the nugget's trajectory. By using microphone boxes, hydrophones or seismographs to construct an array in the bedrock, ocean or on the Moon, it is possible to reconstruct the velocity, mass, and interacting cross section of SNs, and then constrain also the nature of supra-nuclear matter. The acoustic array can also be used for distributed acoustic sensing of meteorites or earthquakes. The sonar localisation system on the proposed High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT) is suggested as a pathfinder for acoustic array detection.

2025-03-26, **Light exposure and temperature effects on quantum efficiency of bialkali metal photomultipier tubes**, Antonio De Benedittis et.al., [2503.20443v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20443v1)

 In astroparticle experiments, photomultiplier tubes are crucial for detecting Cherenkov radiation emitted by charged particles, owing to their exceptional sensitivity to low-intensity light, which is essential for studying high-energy phenomena associated with astrophysical neutrinos. However, due to their high sensitivity, PMTs are vulnerable to significant damage to their photocathode coating when exposed to intense light and/or high temperatures. Although this scenario is rare under controlled conditions, it can become relevant in experiments with prolonged exposure to sunlight and elevated temperatures.   This study presents an analysis of the damage threshold and recovery time of photomultipliers with bialkali metal coatings. The investigation involved measuring the quantum efficiency of the PMTs before and after exposure to a xenon lamp for varying durations, simulating sunlight exposure over several days. Additionally, quantum efficiency was assessed before and after the PMTs were subjected to thermal stress, providing an evaluation of their performance under different thermal conditions.

2025-03-26, **Quantum circuits for simulating neutrino propagation in matter**, Sandeep Joshi et.al., [2503.20238v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20238v1)

 Quantum simulation of particle phenomena is a rapidly advancing field of research. With the widespread availability of quantum simulators, a given quantum system can be simulated in numerous ways, offering flexibility in implementation and exploration. Here, we perform quantum simulation of neutrino propagation in matter, a phenomenon that plays a crucial role in neutrino oscillations. We present quantum circuits with novel gate arrangements to simulate neutrino propagation in both constant and varying matter density profiles. The oscillation probabilities are determined by encoding and measuring the qubit states in the neutrino flavor basis, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.

2025-03-26, **Multi-threaded Simulation Software for the JUNO Experiment**, Peidong Yu et.al., [2503.20219v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20219v1)

 The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a multi-purpose experiment under construction in southern China. JUNO aims to determine the neutrino mass ordering and precisely measure the neutrino oscillation parameters by detecting reactor neutrinos from nuclear power plants. In addition to reactor neutrinos, JUNO can study atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, geo-neutrinos, supernova burst neutrinos, the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), and nucleon decay, covering an energy range from keV to TeV. JUNO consists of a 20 kton liquid scintillator detector, equipped with 17,612 20-inch PMTs and 25,600 3-inch PMTs, achieving a 3\% energy resolution (at 1~MeV). Precise simulation plays a crucial role in the experiment. Developed using the SNiPER framework and Geant4 toolkit, the JUNO simulation software is a key component of the JUNO offline software (JUNOSW). The large detector size and the broad energy range of interest pose challenges for detector simulation in terms of CPU time and memory consumption. As the computing nodes shift to include multiple integrated CPU cores, traditional single-threaded computing model can lead to large memory footprints and inefficient use of system resources. Multi-threading on many-core architectures can significantly improve resource utilization. This paper introduces the design and implementation of multi-threaded simulation software for the JUNO experiment.

2025-03-27, **Large Scale Structure and the Cosmic Web**, Rita Tojeiro et.al., [2503.21759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21759v1)

 The formation and evolution of galaxies cannot be separated from large scale structure growth. Dark matter halos (and, therefore, galaxies) form and grow within the cosmic web - the classification of large-scale structure as distinct environments, namely voids, walls, filaments and nodes. Thanks to the rapid development of extragalactic spectroscopic redshift surveys and cosmological simulations over the last two decades, we are now able to measure the impact of the cosmic web on galaxies and halos in observations and in simulations. In this chapter we summarise the state of play in our understanding of the link between dark matter halos, galaxies, and the cosmic web.

2025-03-27, **Three-Dimensional Stacking as a Line Intensity Mapping Statistic**, D. A. Dunne et.al., [2503.21743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21743v1)

 Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is a growing technique that measures the integrated spectral-line emission from unresolved galaxies over a three-dimensional region of the Universe. Although LIM experiments ultimately aim to provide powerful cosmological constraints via auto-correlation, many LIM experiments are also designed to take advantage of overlapping galaxy surveys, enabling joint analyses of the two datasets. We introduce a flexible simulation pipeline that can generate mock galaxy surveys and mock LIM data simultaneously for the same population of simulated galaxies. Using this pipeline, we explore a simple joint analysis technique: three-dimensional co-addition (stacking) of LIM data on the positions of galaxies from a traditional galaxy catalogue. We test how the output of this technique reacts to changes in experimental design of both the LIM experiment and the galaxy survey, its sensitivity to various astrophysical parameters, and its susceptibility to common systematic errors. We find that an ideal catalogue for a stacking analysis targets as many high-mass dark matter halos as possible. We also find that the signal in a LIM stacking analysis originates almost entirely from the large-scale clustering of halos around the catalogue objects, rather than the catalogue objects themselves. While stacking is a sensitive and conceptually simple way to achieve a LIM detection, thus providing a valuable way to validate a LIM auto-correlation detection, it will likely require a full cross-correlation to achieve further characterization of the galaxy tracers involved, as the cosmological and astrophysical parameters we explore here have degenerate effects on the stack.

2025-03-27, **Interacting dark sectors in light of DESI DR2**, Rahul Shah et.al., [2503.21652v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21652v1)

 Possible interaction between dark energy and dark matter has previously shown promise in alleviating the clustering tension, without exacerbating the Hubble tension, when BAO data from SDSS DR16 is combined with CMB and SNIa datasets. With the recent DESI BAO DR2, there is now a compelling need to re-evaluate this scenario. We combine DESI DR2 with Planck 2018 and Pantheon+ SNIa datasets to constrain interacting dark matter dark energy models, accounting for interaction effects in both the background and perturbation sectors. Our results exhibit similar trends to those observed with SDSS, albeit with improved precision, reinforcing the consistency between the two BAO datasets. In addition to offering a resolution to the $S\_8$ tension, in the phantom-limit, the dark energy equation of state exhibits an early-phantom behaviour, aligning with DESI DR2 findings, before transitioning to $w\sim-1$ at lower redshifts, regardless of the DE parametrization. However, the statistical significance of excluding $w=-1$ is reduced compared to their non-interacting counterparts.

2025-03-27, **Polarized equatorial emission and hot spots around black holes with a dark matter halo**, Tsanimir Angelov et.al., [2503.21395v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21395v1)

 We study the linear polarization of the accretion disk around black holes with a dark matter halo. The interaction of the black hole with the dark matter is modelled by considering an exact solution to the Einstein equations which describes a superposition of the Schwarzschild black hole with a Hernquist-type matter distribution. We simulate the observable polarization of a magnetized fluid ring orbiting around the black hole and evaluate the influence of the dark matter halo on its properties for physical parameters compatible with the dark matter distribution in galaxies. The polarization intensity and direction of the direct images deviate with less than $1\%$ from the isolated Schwarzschild black hole for a range of magnetic field configurations. For the indirect images the deviation increases with an order of magnitude but still remains under $10\%$ for small inclination angles corresponding to the galactic targets M87* and Sgr A*. This makes the detection of the dark matter impact on the polarized emission from the accretion disk extremely challenging in the near future.

2025-03-27, **Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry**, Antun Balaz et.al., [2503.21366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21366v1)

 Long-baseline atom interferometry is a promising technique for probing various aspects of fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology, including searches for ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and for gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range around 1~Hz that is not covered by present and planned detectors using laser interferometry. The MAGIS detector is under construction at Fermilab, as is the MIGA detector in France. The PX46 access shaft to the LHC has been identified as a very suitable site for an atom interferometer of height $\sim 100$m, sites at the Boulby mine in the UK and the Canfranc Laboratory are also under investigation, and possible sites for km-class detectors have been suggested. The Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration proposes a coordinated programme of interferometers of increasing baselines.

2025-03-27, **Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). The Euclid view on Planck galaxy protocluster candidates: towards a probe of the highest sites of star formation at cosmic noon**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2503.21304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21304v1)

 We search for galaxy protoclusters at redshifts $z > 1.5$ in the first data release (Q1) of the $\textit{Euclid}$ survey. We make use of the catalogues delivered by the $\textit{Euclid}$ Science Ground Segment (SGS). After a galaxy selection on the $H\_\textrm{E}$ magnitude and on the photometric redshift quality, we undertake the search using the $\texttt{DETECTIFz}$ algorithm, an overdensity finder based on Delaunay tessellation that uses photometric redshift probability distributions through Monte Carlo simulations. In this pilot study, we conduct a search in the 11 $\textit{Euclid}$ tiles that contain previously known $\textit{Planck}$ high star-forming galaxy protocluster candidates and focus on the two detections that coincide with these regions. These counterparts lie at photometric redshifts $z\_\textrm{ph}=1.63^{+0.19}\_{-0.23}$ and $z\_\textrm{ph}=1.56^{+0.18}\_{-0.21}$ and have both been confirmed by two other independent protocluster detection algorithms. We study their colours, their derived stellar masses and star-formation rates, and we estimate their halo mass lower limits. We investigate whether we are intercepting these galaxy overdensities in their `dying' phase, such that the high star-formation rates would be due to their last unsustainable starburst before transitioning to groups or clusters of galaxies. Indeed, some galaxy members are found to lie above the main sequence of galaxies (star-formation rate versus stellar mass). These overdense regions occupy a specific position in the dark matter halo mass / redshift plane where forming galaxy clusters are expected to have experienced a transition between cold flows to shock heating in the halo. Finally, we empirically update the potential for galaxy protocluster discoveries at redshift up to $z \simeq3$ (wide survey) and $z \simeq5.5$ (deep survey) with $\textit{Euclid}$ for the next data release (DR1).

2025-03-27, **Simultaneous Formation of the Andromeda Giant Southern Stream and the Substructures in the Andromeda Halo**, Misa Yamaguchi et.al., [2503.21217v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21217v1)

 We investigate a minor merger event in M31 that simultaneously forms the Andromeda Giant Southern Stream (AGSS), Eastern Extent (EE), North-Eastern Shelf (NES), and Western Shel (WS), offering a unified model for these substructures. By varying the scale radius and mass of the progenitor's dark matter halo (DMH), around the range predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model, we successfully reproduce the spatial features of these substructures. Across the limited range of parameters considered in this study, our analysis shows that the spatial evolution of NES and WS is independent of the gravitational potential of the DMH associated with the progenitor, while a shallower potential shifts EE further north. The simulations clearly demonstrate that the progenitor with a DMH mass of $9\times10^9M\_\odot$ colliding with M31 850 Myr ago could simultaneously form al thes esubstructures. The simulation results indicate that EE lies several 10kpc closer to us than the aligned Stream Cp, which is actually a metal-poor component of Stream C, whose farther distance suggests overlapping debris from distinct collision events, while both remain closely aligned in celestial coordinates. Furthermore, we predict the existence of a positive stream along the AGSS, characterized by positive line-of-sight velocities relative to M31, which complements an already observed negative stream exhibiting negative line-of-sight velocities. Finally, we propose that three objects, namely Stream B, a metal-rich component of Stream C known as Stream Cr, and EE, are components of the Andromeda Giant Southern Arc (AGSA) connected to the AGSS. Although the existence of the positive stream and a complete picture of AGSA have yet to be confirmed observationally, we anticipate that future spectroscopic observations and further advances in theoretical studies will verify their existence.

2025-03-27, **Lepton collider imprints of Inelastic dark matter model**, Wei Liu et.al., [2503.21083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21083v1)

 We explore the potential for detecting the inelastic dark model (DM) with an additional $U(1)\_D$ gauge symmetry at various types of lepton colliders. The new gauge boson $Z'$ resulting from the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)\_D$ can act as a portal connecting the Standard Model fermions and DM fermions $\chi$, thereby facilitating the production of $Z'$ and its decay into DM fermions. The mass difference between the excited DM fermion $\chi\_2$ and the ground DM fermion $\chi\_1$ induces the subsequent decays $\chi\_2\to \chi\_1 +\text{vis}$, where $\chi\_2$ and $\chi\_1$ serve as long lived particles and DM candidate, respectively. For the inelastic DM with a mass $m\_{\chi\_1}$ in the range of (1-100) GeV, we find that the future lepton colliders can probe many regions not accessible by current experiments and provide greater projected sensitivity than the LHC and Belle in previous studies. This suggests that future colliders can provide complementary exploration of the inelastic dark matter model.

2025-03-26, **Estimating non-gaussian bias using counts of tracers**, Neal Dalal et.al., [2503.21024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21024v1)

 Local-type primordial non-gaussianity generates a distinctive term in the clustering of tracers of large-scale structure, behaving as $k^{-2}$ at small wavenumbers $k$. In order to use this signal in a sample of galaxies to measure the amplitude of primordial non-gaussianity, $f\_{NL}$, we need to independently determine the degenerate bias coefficient, $b\_\Phi$, which quantifies the logarithmic response of the galaxy number density to a change in amplitude of the matter clustering. We study whether $b\_\Phi$ may be estimated from the observed evolution of the number density of galaxies as a function of redshift. Using cosmological N-body simulations, we find that $b\_\Phi$ may be estimated reasonably well for dark matter halos across the range of redshifts and halo masses used by large-scale structure surveys aimed at measuring $f\_{NL}$. This includes non-gaussian secondary bias (or assembly bias) in halo concentration, which has previously been found to be quite large in amplitude. For an observed survey of galaxies, we additionally need to consider the selection function of the sample, which can introduce redshift dependence via cuts on apparent magnitude and colour. These effects of the selection function can be mitigated by further cutting the sample using k-corrected magnitudes and colours, to retain only those galaxies that would pass the targeting criteria for all redshifts within the interval considered.

2025-03-26, **Galaxy and Halo Root Systems: Fingerprints of Mass Assembly**, Mark Neyrinck et.al., [2503.21015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21015v1)

 We discuss what we call halo or galaxy root systems, collections of particle pathlines that show the infall of matter from the initial uniform distribution into a collapsed structure. The matter clumps as it falls in, producing filamentary density enhancements analogous to tree roots and branches, blood vessels, or even human transportation infrastructure in cities and regions. This relates to the larger-scale cosmic web, but is defined locally about one of its nodes; a physical, geometric version of a merger tree. We find dark-matter-halo root systems on average to exhibit more roots and root branches for the largest cluster haloes than in small haloes. This may relate to the `cosmic-web detachment' mechanism that likely contributes to star-formation quenching in galaxy groups and clusters. We also find that high spin manifests in these root systems as curvier roots.

 It has been argued that the so-called memory-burden effect could cause black holes to become stabilized by the information that they carry, thereby suppressing the rate at which they undergo Hawking evaporation. It has furthermore been suggested that this opens a new mass window, between $10^{4}\,{\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{10}\,{\rm g}$, over which primordial black holes could constitute the dark matter of our Universe. We show in this \textit{letter} that this is true only if the transition from the semi-classical phase of a black hole to its memory-burdened phase is practically instantaneous. If this transition is instead more continuous, Hawking evaporation will persist at relevant levels throughout the eras of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and recombination, leading to stringent constraints which rule out the possibility that black holes lighter than $\sim 4 \times 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$ could make up all or most of the dark matter.

 We investigate the evolution of density perturbations in dark matter with finite number density and velocity dispersion. Using a truncated BBGKY hierarchy, we derive analytical expressions for the dark matter power spectrum during radiation and matter domination. A component of {\it warm white noise} emerges in our analysis, which arises due to the finite number density and undergoes scale-dependent evolution because of the velocity dispersion. Although free streaming erases adiabatic initial perturbations on small scales, warm white noise persists below the free-streaming length and grows during matter domination, with growth suppressed below the dark matter Jeans length. Our calculated power spectra agree with $N$-body simulations in the linear regime and accurately predict halo mass functions in the nonlinear regime. Effects of warm white noise can emerge on observable quasi-linear scales for ultralight dark matter produced after inflation with a subhorizon correlation length. Our formalism is applicable to these scenarios (with de Broglie-scale quasi-particles), to cases in which dark matter includes macroscopic structures (such as primordial black holes), and to traditional warm and cold dark matter scenarios.

 In this paper, we investigate the production of Majorana fermionic dark matter (DM) via the Higgs portal, considering both freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms during and after the post-inflationary reheating phase. We assume that the Universe is reheated through the decay of the inflaton into a pair of massless fermions. Our analysis focuses on how the non-standard evolution of the Hubble expansion rate and the thermal bath temperature during reheating influence DM production. Additionally, we examine the impact of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), distinguishing between scenarios where DM freeze-in or freeze-out occurs before or after EWSB. We further explore the viable DM parameter space and its compatibility with current and future detection experiments, including XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), XLZD, and collider searches. Moreover, we incorporate constraints from the Lyman-$\alpha$ bound to ensure consistency with small-scale structure formation.

2025-03-26, **Immortality through the dark forces: Dark-charge primordial black holes as dark matter candidates**, Jessica Santiago et.al., [2503.20696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20696v1)

 The fact that no Hawking radiation from the final stages of evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) has yet been observed places stringent bounds on their allowed contribution to dark matter. Concretely, for Schwarzschild PBHs, i.e., uncharged and non-rotating black holes, this rules out black hole masses of less than $10^{-15} M\_{\odot}$. In this article, we propose that by including an additional 'dark' $U(1)$ charge one can significantly lower the PBHs' Hawking temperature, slowing down their evaporation process and significantly extending their lifetimes. With this, PBHs again become a viable option for dark matter candidates over a large mass range. We will explore in detail the effects of varying the dark electron (lightest dark charged fermion) mass and charge on the evaporation dynamics. For instance, we will show that by allowing the dark electron to have a sufficiently high mass and/or low charge, our approach suppresses both Hawking radiation and the Schwinger effect, effectively extending even the lifespan of PBHs with masses smaller than $10^{-15} M\_{\odot}$ beyond the current age of the universe. We will finally present a new lower bound on the allowed mass range for dark-charged PBHs as a function of the dark electron charge and mass, showing that the PBHs' mass can get to at least as low as $10^{-24}M\_\odot$ depending on the dark electron properties. This demonstrates that the phenomenology of the evaporation of PBHs is ill-served by a focus solely on Schwarzschild black holes.

2025-03-26, **Exploring the Dark Universe: A European Strategy for Axions and other WISPs Discovery**, Deniz Aybas et.al., [2503.20432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20432v1)

 Axions and other very weakly interacting slim (with $m <$ 1 GeV) particles (WISPs) are a common feature of several extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The search of WISPs was already recommended in the last update of the European strategy on particle physics (ESPP). After that, the physics case for WISPs has gained additional momentum. Indeed, WISPs may provide a new paradigm to explain the nature of dark matter and puzzling astrophysical and particle physics observations. This document briefly summarizes current searches for WISPs and the perspectives in this research field for the next decade, ranging from their theoretical underpinning, over their indirect observational consequences in astrophysics, to their search in laboratory experiments. It is stressed that in Europe a rich, diverse, and low-cost experimental program is already underway with the potential for one or more game-changing discoveries. In this context, it is also reported the role of the EU funded COST Action ''Cosmic WISPers in the Dark Universe: Theory, astrophysics, and experiments'' (CA21106, https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA21106) in coordinating and supporting WISPs searches in Europe, shaping a roadmap to track the strategy to guarantee a European leadership in this field of research. This document has been submitted in March 2025 as an input to the update process of the ESPP.

 Light bosons, beyond the standard model and as prominent candidates for dark matter, can mediate velocity and spin dependent exotic interaction between electron spins and nucleons. At short ranges, it remains an open challenge to test this exotic interaction with high precision. Here, we present a method based on diamagnetic-levitated force sensor to detect the exotic interaction at the millimeter scale. Improved constraints for the coupling $g\_A^e g\_V^N$ are established, within the force range spanning from 0.15 mm to 1.5 mm. And the constraint $\|g\_A^e g\_V^N\| \leq 4.39 \times10^{-26}$ at $\lambda$ = 0.5 mm at the $95 \%$ confidence level, significantly surpasses previous results by more than three orders of magnitude. The diamagnetic levitation force measurement system developed here can also be repurposed to probe other exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as the exotic spin-spin interaction. This system provides a platform for the exploration of dark matter.

 Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are predicted thermonuclear explosions of massive stars with helium core masses exceeding $\sim 65M\_\odot$ and synthesize substantial amounts of radioactive $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}$ ($M(\mathrm{^{56}Ni})\sim60M\_\odot$ in extreme cases). To investigate their observational signatures, we developed a 1D Monte Carlo radiation transport code and performed simulations of gamma-ray and hard X-ray emissions from the decay chain $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}\to\mathrm{^{56}Co}\to\mathrm{^{56}Fe}$. We find that key gamma-ray lines (847 and 1238 keV) from $\mathrm{^{56}Co}$ decay in the $130M\_\odot$ helium core model can be detected up to 300-400 Mpc by next-generation MeV gamma-ray telescopes. In contrast, the signals from the $100M\_\odot$ model remain below the detection limits. Our results provide the template for gamma-ray follow-up observations of PISNe. Considering theoretical predictions and observational constraints, we estimate PISN event rates within 300 Mpc to be approximately 0.1 events per year, highlighting their rarity but also emphasizing their feasibility as targets for future gamma-ray observations over the decade.

2025-03-27, **3D MHD simulations of runaway pulsars in core collapse supernova remnants**, D. M. A. Meyer et.al., [2503.21492v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21492v1)

 Pulsars are one of the possible final stages in the evolution of massive stars. If a supernova explosion is anisotropic, it can give the pulsar a powerful kick, propelling it to supersonic speeds. The resulting pulsar wind nebula is significantly reshaped by its interaction with the surrounding medium as the pulsar moves through it. First, the pulsar crosses the supernova remnant, followed by the different layers of circumstellar medium formed during different stages of the progenitor star s evolution. We aim to investigate how the evolutionary history of massive stars shapes the bow shock nebulae of runaway kicked pulsars, and how these influences in turn affect the dynamics and non-thermal radio emission of the entire pulsar remnant. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the PLUTO code to model the pulsar wind nebula generated by a runaway pulsar in the supernova remnant of a red supergiant progenitor, and derive its non-thermal radio emission. The supernova remnant and the pre-supernova circumstellar medium of the progenitor strongly confine and reshape the pulsar wind nebula of the runaway pulsar, bending its two side jets inwards and giving the nebula an arched shape for an observer perpendicular to the jets and the propagation direction, as observed around PSR J1509 5850 and Gemina. We perform the first classical 3D model of a pulsar moving inward through its supernova ejecta and circumstellar medium, inducing a bending of its polar jet that turns into characteristic radio synchrotron signature. The circumstellar medium of young runaway pulsars has a significant influence on the morphology and emission of pulsar wind nebulae, whose comprehension requires a detailed understanding of the evolutionary history of the progenitor star.

2025-03-27, **Constraints on AvERA Cosmologies from Cosmic Chronometers and Type Ia Supernovae**, Adrienn Pataki et.al., [2503.21369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21369v1)

 We constrain AvERA cosmologies in comparison with the flat $\Lambda$CDM model using cosmic chronometer (CC) data and the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The analysis includes CC fits performed with the \texttt{emcee} sampler and supernova fits based on a custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation. For model comparison, we apply Anderson-Darling tests on normalized residuals to assess consistency with a standard normal distribution. Best-fit parameters are derived within the redshift ranges $z \leq 2$ for CCs and $z \leq 2.3$ for SNe. The best-fit values of the Hubble constant are ${H\_0=68.28\_{-3.24}^{+3.23}~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ from the CC analysis and ${H\_0=71.99\_{-1.03}^{+1.05}~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ from the SN analysis, for the AvERA cosmology. These results are consistent within $1\sigma$ with the corresponding AvERA simulation value of $H(z=0)$. Both the CC and SN datasets substantially favor AvERA cosmologies over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We have identified signs of overfitting in both models, which suggests the possibility of overestimating the uncertainties in the Pantheon+ covariance matrix.

2025-03-27, **Study of the origin of the azimuthal variation of synchrotron X-ray spectrum from SNR RX J0852.0-4622**, Dai Tateishi et.al., [2503.21331v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21331v1)

 We report the azimuthal distribution of the X-ray energy spectrum of non-thermal dominant supernova remnant RX J0852.0$-$4622. The X-rays from the shock region observed by the X-ray astronomy satellite Suzaku/XIS in the energy range of 2-8 keV are well described by the absorbed power-law model and can be parameterized with flux and photon index. The X-ray flux and photon index are bimodally distributed in relation to the azimuthal angle. To understand its origin, we examined three possible causes: azimuthal variation by (1) the galactic magnetic field, (2) cloud density, and (3) shock velocity. From the polarization observations of stars near the SNR, we find that the Galactic magnetic field around the SNR is not aligned. This result leads us to conclude that the azimuthal variation of the X-ray spectrum is most likely not caused by the Galactic magnetic field. The X-ray fluxes are positively correlated with the cloud density with a significance of $\sim 5\sigma$, and the azimuthal distributions of these physical quantities are particularly pronounced in the northern part of the SNR. In addition, the X-ray fluxes on the southern part of the SNR are positively correlated with the shock velocity. This phenomenon can be qualitatively explained by the increase in roll-off energy due to the amplification of the magnetic field by (A) the interaction between the shock and dense clouds in the north and (B) the fast shock velocity in the south of the SNR. Since the shock velocity is likely related to the cloud density interacting with the shock, we conclude that the azimuthal variation of cloud density most likely causes the azimuthal variations of the X-ray flux and photon index.

2025-03-27, **Proper Motion and Natal Kick in the Galactic Black Hole X-ray Binary AT2019wey**, Lang Cui et.al., [2503.21119v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21119v1)

 Understanding the formation mechanisms of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries (BHXBs) remains a fundamental challenge in astrophysics. The natal kick velocities imparted during black hole formation provide crucial constraints on these formation channels. In this work, we present a new-epoch very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observation of the Galactic BHXB AT2019wey carried out in 2023. Combining with archival VLBI data from 2020, we successfully measure the proper motion of AT2019wey over a 3-year timescale, namely $0.78\pm0.12$~\masyr\ in right ascension and $-0.42\pm0.07$~\masyr\ in declination. Employing the measured proper motion, we estimate its peculiar velocity and the potential kick velocity (PKV), through Monte Carlo simulations incorporating uncertainties of its distance and radial velocity. The estimated PKV distributions and height above the Galactic plane suggest that AT2019wey's black hole likely formed through a supernova explosion rather than direct collapse.

2025-03-26, **Age Estimation of the Radcliffe Wave from Open Star Clusters**, V. V. Bobylev et.al., [2503.21019v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21019v1)

 Four samples of open star clusters (OSCs) with average ages of 5.2, 18.6, 40, and 61 Myr have been analyzed. The selection of these OSCs was carried out from a narrow region inclined to the galactic axis y at an angle of 25$^\circ$. The spectral analysis of the vertical positions and velocities of the selected clusters showed that the Radcliffe wave is associated with OSCs no older than 30 Myr. The following estimates of the Radcliffe wave characteristics were obtained for the OSCs with an average age of 5.2 Myr: $z\_{max}=117\pm12$ pc with the wavelength $\lambda=4.55\pm0.14$ kpc, the vertical velocity disturbance amplitude $W\_{max}=4.86\pm0.19$ km s$^{-1}$ with the wavelength $\lambda=1.74\pm0.08$ kpc. For the OSCs with an average age of 18.6 Myr, the estimates are as follows: $z\_{max} = 54\pm5$ pc and $\lambda=6.30\pm0.12$ kpc, the vertical velocity disturbance amplitude $W\_{max}=7.90\pm0.16$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\lambda=0.83\pm0.11$ kpc. The radial motion of the Radcliffe wave away from the galactic center has been confirmed. The velocity of such movement is 10 pc Myr$^{-1}$. In our opinion, the spatial distribution of OSCs younger than 30 Myr does not contradict the hypothesis of the association of the Radcliffe wave with the impact of shock waves from supernova explosions that arose on an extended front comparable in scale to the entire wave, that is, about 2 kpc in size.

2025-03-26, **Broad Observational Perspectives Achieved by the Accreting White Dwarf Sciences in the XMM-Newton and Chandra Eras**, Solen Balman et.al., [2503.20973v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20973v1)

 Accreting white dwarf binaries (AWDs) comprise cataclysmic variables (CVs), symbiotics, AM CVns, and other related systems that host a primary white dwarf (WD) accreting from a main sequence or evolved companion star. AWDs are a product of close binary evolution; thus, they are important for understanding the evolution and population of X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and other galaxies. AWDs are essential for studying astrophysical plasmas under different conditions along with accretion physics and processes, transient events, matter ejection and outflows, compact binary evolution, mergers, angular momentum loss mechanisms, and nuclear processes leading to explosions. AWDs are also closely related to other objects in the late stages of stellar evolution, with other accreting objects in compact binaries, and even share common phenomena with young stellar objects, active galactic nuclei, quasars, and supernova remnants. As X-ray astronomy came to a climax with the start of the Chandra and XMM-Newton missions owing to their unprecedented instrumentation, new excellent imaging capabilities, good time resolution, and X-ray grating technologies allowed immense advancement in many aspects of astronomy and astrophysics. In this review, we lay out a panorama of developments on the study of AWDs that have been accomplished and have been made possible by these two observatories; we summarize the key observational achievements and the challenges ahead.

2025-03-26, **Explaining the $^{12}\text{C}/^{13}\text{C}$ ratio in the Galactic halo: the contribution from shell mergers in primordial massive stars**, F. Rizzuti et.al., [2503.20876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20876v1)

 Recent campaigns of observations have provided new measurements of the carbon isotopes in the most metal-poor stars of the Galaxy. These stars are so metal-poor that they could only have been enriched by one or few generations of massive progenitors. However, explaining the primary production of $^{13}$C and the low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio measured in these stars is challenging. Making use of the most up-to-date models for zero-metal and low-metallicity stars, we investigate the possible sources of $^{13}$C at low metallicity and verify whether massive stars could be the sole responsible for the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio observed in halo stars. We employ the stochastic model for Galactic chemical evolution GEMS to reproduce the evolution of CNO elements and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio, including the enrichment from rotating massive stars, some of which show the occurrence of H-He shell mergers. We find that stars without H-He shell mergers do not produce enough $^{13}$C to be compatible with the observations. Instead, the primary production by shell mergers and later ejection during the supernova explosion can explain 30 < $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C < 100. The observations are best reproduced assuming a large frequency of shell mergers. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C < 30 can only be reproduced assuming an outer layer ejection and no explosion, but requiring a larger production of $^{12}$C and $^{13}$C. Zero-metal and low-metallicity spinstars with H-He shell mergers appear as the most plausible scenario to explain the low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in CEMP-no stars. The entire range of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values can be explained by assuming that some stars fully explode while others only eject their outer layers. Shell mergers should be also more frequent and productive, which is allowed by the current uncertainties in the treatment of convection in stellar modelling.

2025-03-26, **Spectroscopic Follow-Up of Candidate Runaway Stars**, Guillermo Torres et.al., [2503.20856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20856v1)

 Runaway stars are characterized by higher space velocities than typical field stars. They are presumed to have been ejected from their birth places by one or more energetic mechanisms, including supernova explosions. Accurate radial velocities are essential for investigating their origin, by tracing back their Galactic orbits to look for close encounters in space and in time with neutron stars and young associations. While most studies of runaways have focused on OB stars, later-type stars have also been considered on occasion. Here we report the results of a long-term high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring program with the goal of providing accurate radial velocities for 188 runaway candidates of spectral type A and later, proposed by Tetzlaff et al. (2011). We obtained multiple measurements over a period of about 13 yr to guard against the possibility that some may be members of binary or multiple systems, adding archival observations going back another 25 yr in some cases. We report new spectroscopic orbital solutions for more than three dozen systems. Many more are also found to be binaries based on available astrometric information. A small-scale study carried out here to trace back the paths of our targets together with those of four well-studied, optically-visible neutron stars among the so-called Magnificent Seven, resulted in no credible encounters.

2025-03-26, **Common envelopes in massive stars III: The obstructive role of radiation transport in envelope ejection**, Mike Y. M. Lau et.al., [2503.20506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20506v1)

 We present 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of common-envelope (CE) evolution involving a 12 solar mass red supergiant donor and a 3 solar mass companion. Existing 3D simulations are predominantly adiabatic, focusing strongly on low-mass donors on the red giant and asymptotic giant branches. However, the adiabatic assumption breaks down once the perturbed CE material becomes optically thin or when entering a longer-timescale evolutionary phase after the dynamical plunge-in. This is especially important for high-mass red supergiant donors, which have short thermal timescales, adding significant uncertainty in understanding how massive binary stars evolve into gravitational-wave sources, X-ray binaries, stripped-envelope supernovae, and more. We compare our radiation hydrodynamics simulations with an adiabatic simulation from Paper I that is otherwise identical, finding that radiative diffusion strongly inhibits CE ejection. The fraction of ejected mass is roughly half that of the adiabatic case when recombination energy release is not included. Almost no material is ejected during the dynamical plunge-in, and longer-timescale ejection during the slow spiral-in is suppressed. However, the orbital separation reached at the end of the dynamical plunge-in does not differ significantly. The large amount of remaining bound mass tentatively supports the emerging view that the dynamical plunge-in is followed by a non-adiabatic phase, during which a substantial fraction of the envelope is ejected and the binary orbit may continue to evolve.
