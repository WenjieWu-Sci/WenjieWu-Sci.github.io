2025-12-08, **Enhanced active-sterile neutrino polarizability at the intensity frontier**, Julia Gehrlein et.al., [2512.07691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07691v1)

 Electromagnetic probes of neutrinos can provide insights into physics beyond the Standard Model. Among the possible electromagnetic interactions of neutrinos is neutrino polarizability, a dimension-7 effective operator that couples two neutrinos to two photons. In this manuscript, we study a realization of the neutrino polarizability operator in which one of the active neutrinos is replaced by a sterile neutrino. We derive new constraints on this active-sterile neutrino polarizability from its contribution to neutrino-nucleus scattering with a single photon in the final state at neutrino experiments. We show that a realization of this operator via a light mediator can explain the MiniBooNE low-energy excess while remaining consistent with other experimental constraints. Finally, we comment on additional model realizations of this higher-dimensional operator.

2025-12-08, **Probing flavor-diagonal couplings of doubly-charged scalar at low and high energies**, Gang Li et.al., [2512.07255v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07255v1)

 We investigate the phenomenology of a TeV-scale doubly-charged scalar from the right-handed sector within the framework of left-right symmetric models. Focusing on its flavor-diagonal couplings to right-handed electrons and muons, we assess probes from both high-energy colliders and low-energy precision experiments. High-energy processes include Bhabha scattering at LEP and future circular electron-positron colliders (CEPC/FCC-ee), direct production at the LHC, and dedicated searches and precision measurements at proposed muon colliders and $μ$TRISTAN. Low-energy observables encompass parity-violating Møller scattering, muon anomalous magnetic moment, and muonium-antimuonium oscillations. Our combined analysis indicates that for a doubly-charged scalar in the $1$-$3$ TeV range, the flavor-diagonal Yukawa couplings to electrons and muons as small as $10^{-2}$ are accessible. Observations of such a doubly-charged scalar would potentially point toward the type-I seesaw mechanism of neutrino masses in the left-right symmetric model with $D$-parity breaking.

2025-12-08, **Search for Light Sterile Neutrinos With Two Neutrino Beams at MicroBooNE**, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., [2512.07159v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07159v1)

 The existence of three distinct neutrino flavours, $ν\_{e}$, $ν\_μ$, and $ν\_τ$, is a central tenet of the Standard Model of particle physics. Quantum-mechanical interference can allow a neutrino of one initial flavour to be detected some time later as a different flavour, a process called neutrino oscillation. Several anomalous observations inconsistent with this three-flavour picture have motivated the hypothesis that an additional neutrino state exists which does not interact directly with matter, termed a "sterile" neutrino, $ν\_s$. This includes anomalous observations from the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments, consistent with $ν\_μ\rightarrowν\_{e}$ transitions at a distance inconsistent with the three-neutrino picture. Here, we use data obtained from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber in two accelerator neutrino beams to exclude the single light sterile neutrino interpretation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies at the 95\% confidence level (CL). Additionally, we rule out a significant portion of the parameter space that could explain the gallium anomaly. This is the first measurement to use two accelerator neutrino beams to break a degeneracy between $ν\_{e}$ appearance and disappearance that would otherwise weaken the sensitivity to the sterile neutrino hypothesis. We find no evidence for either $ν\_μ\rightarrowν\_{e}$ flavour transitions or $ν\_{e}$ disappearance that would indicate non-standard flavour oscillations. Our results show that previous anomalous observations consistent with $ν\_μ\rightarrowν\_{e}$ transitions cannot be explained by introducing a single sterile neutrino state.

2025-12-08, **Minimal lepton models with non-holomorphic modular $A_{4}$ symmetry**, Xiang-Yan Gao et.al., [2512.07158v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07158v1)

 We present a comprehensive bottom-up analysis of lepton mass and mixing based on the non-holomorphic $A\_{4}$ modular symmetry. Neutrinos are assumed to be Majorana particles and the light neutrino masses are generated through the Weinberg operator. In this framework, we construct all phenomenologically viable models with minimal number of free parameters, where the Yukawa couplings are expressed in terms of polyharmonic Maaß forms of weights $\pm4$, $\pm2$ and $0$ at level $N=3$. Without imposing generalized CP (gCP) symmetry, we identify 147 (6) viable models with seven real free parameters that successfully reproduce the current experimental data of lepton sector for the normal (inverted) mass ordering. When gCP symmetry consistent with $A\_{4}$ modular symmetry is included, the number of free parameters is reduced by one, yielding 47 (5) phenomenologically viable models in the normal (inverted) mass ordering. Finally, we present detailed numerical analyses of a representative model for both mass orderings to illustrate these results.

2025-12-07, **Paucity of downward UHE neutrino tracks in IceCube versus unexpected huge KM3-230213A event: solving the puzzles?**, D. Fargion et.al., [2512.07042v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07042v1)

 Recently the ARCA array detector published the down-ward-horizontal event: the KM3-230213A. It appeared as the most energetic neutrino ever observed: about 200 PeV (2 10^17 eV) up to EeV (10^18 eV) energy. This huge value, is puzzling. It is not statistically consistent with several upper bound derived by two greater and longer life detectors: by IceCube and in particular by AUGER array. Asymmetry in recent IceCube neutrino alert tracks upward and downward at same horizontal angles as ARCA one, suggest that they are mostly polluted atmospheric muon bundles. This paucity also disfavor the skimming neutrino interpretation by ARCA. We suggest that the array floating and bending in the deep sea may lead, sometime, to a misleading geometry that is pointing to a wrong arrival angle direction: a much less horizontal muon (neutrino) track respect to a much real one, more inclined and vertical, due to atmospheric muon bundle or charmed single event. Contrary to present argument, if such a rare event would be soon rediscovered in data or re-observed, it would open the road to a new guaranteed Tau neutrino Astronomy. At EeV energy such upward tau air-showers should shine AUGER telescopes or blaze future satellite in Space. A previous model in astrophysics considered energetic neutrino E>>100 EeV, neutrino scattering, onto cosmic, relic, light mass ones. Their ultra-relativistic Z boson resonance formation and its decay in flight would produce hadron UHECR relics around tens-hundred EeV energy. Explaining how sources located at far distances, above the usual GZK hundred Mpc, cut off ones, may shine and cluster in AUGER or TA data.

2025-12-07, **Constraining and Resolving Lorentz-Violating New Physics at ESSnuSB Using Complementarity with DUNE**, Himanshu Bora et.al., [2512.06953v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06953v1)

 We examine the sensitivity of the ESSnuSB and DUNE long-baseline neutrino experiments to isotropic, CPT-violating Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). Using detailed simulations for the 360 km and 540 km ESSnuSB baselines and the 1300 km DUNE setup, we assess how LIV parameters influence oscillation probabilities, event spectra, and degeneracies among oscillation parameters. We find that LIV-induced modifications can closely mimic variations in $θ\_{23}$ and $δ\_{\rm CP}$, potentially leading to incorrect determination of the atmospheric mixing angle octant and the leptonic CP phase if LIV effects are not accounted for. Although combining the two ESSnuSB baselines improves overall sensitivity, it does not fully remove these degeneracies. In contrast, a joint ESSnuSB+DUNE analysis benefiting from the synergy between second-maximum sensitivity at ESSnuSB and first-maximum, matter-enhanced sensitivity at DUNE can successfully resolve all these degeneracies and can yield significantly stronger constraints on all the LIV parameters. The results presented here highlights the essential role of multi-baseline, multi-energy experimental strategies to probe Planck-suppressed Lorentz-violating new physics.

2025-12-07, **Nucleon 3D intrinsic spin structure from the weak-neutral axial-vector form factors**, Yi Chen et.al., [2512.06801v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06801v1)

 Relativistic 3D weak-neutral axial-vector four-current and spin distributions inside a nucleon (or a general spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron) including three weak-neutral axial-vector form factors are investigated for the first time. We clarify that the relativistic 3D axial charge distribution in the Breit frame is completely described by the induced pseudotensor form factor $G\_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than by the axial form factor $G\_A^Z(Q^2)$. We demonstrate that $R\_A \equiv \sqrt{ \frac{-6}{G\_A^Z(0) }\frac{\text{d} G\_A^Z(Q^2) }{\text{d} Q^2} \Big\|\_{Q^2=0} }$ can not be interpreted as the physically meaningful 3D root-mean-square axial radius of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron. The genuine axial radius for any spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron in fact does not exist. We also show that the relativistic 3D weak-neutral spin radius $r\_\text{spin} = \sqrt{\langle r\_\text{spin}^2 \rangle}$, with $\langle r\_\text{spin}^2 \rangle \equiv R\_A^2 + \frac{ 1 }{ 4M^2 }\left[ 1 + \frac{ 2 G\_P^Z(0) }{ G\_A^Z(0) } \right]$ based on the relativistic and intrinsic 3D weak-neutral spin distribution in the Breit frame, is a physically meaningful radius that can be unambiguously defined for the nucleon, which provides an additional key motivation for the further determination of the induced pseudoscalar form factor $G\_P^Z(Q^2)$. Numerically, we find that $R\_A \approx 0.6510~\text{fm}$, $r\_\text{spin} \approx 2.1054~\text{fm}$ and $\overline r\_\text{spin} \equiv r\_\text{spin}/3 \approx 0.7018~\text{fm}$. For future experimental measurements of $G\_A^Z(Q^2)$ and $G\_T^Z(Q^2)$, we also derive the full tree-level unpolarized differential cross sections for neutrino-proton and antineutrino-proton elastic scattering in the lab frame, in hoping to provide a complementary and new perspective to unveil the nucleon spin structure by using (anti)neutrino-based facilities.

2025-12-07, **Probing anomalous $W^-W^+γ/Z$ couplings in the SMEFT with $e^-e^+ \to W^-W^+ \to 4j/\ell^-\ell^+\slashed{E}$ channel**, Amir Subba et.al., [2512.06671v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06671v1)

 We investigate anomalous charged triple gauge boson couplings induced by $SU(2)\_L \times U(1)\_Y$ gauge-invariant dimension-6 operators in the HISZ basis through the processes $e^-e^+ \to 4j$ and $e^-e^+ \to \ell^-\ell^+ + \text{missing energy}$ at $\sqrt{s}=250\,$GeV with longitudinally polarized beams. The analysis includes three CP-even operators $(O\_{WWW}, O\_W, O\_B)$ and two CP-odd operators $(\tilde O\_{WWW}, \tilde O\_W)$, which parameterize deviations in the $W^-W^+γ/Z$ vertex. All leading-order contributions are included, including interference between $W^-W^+$ production and non-resonant amplitudes. In the $e^-e^+ \to 4j$ channel, $W^-W^+$ candidates are selected using boosted decision trees. The $W$-boson charges are reconstructed using a jet-charge observable, and jet flavors from $W$ decays are identified with a dedicated classifier, enabling measurements of vector polarization and correlation asymmetries. In the $e^-e^+ \to \ell^-\ell^+ + \text{missing energy}$ channel, events are selected with cuts on lepton transverse momentum and dilepton mass, and the two neutrino momenta are reconstructed using neural-network regression. Combining total cross sections with spin asymmetries allows constraints on anomalous gauge couplings. The fully hadronic channel provides the strongest sensitivity to $O\_B$ and $\tilde O\_W$, while the semi-leptonic channel yields tighter limits on $O\_{WWW}$, $O\_W$, and $\tilde O\_{WWW}$. The fully leptonic channel adds complementary sensitivity. Finally, we derive marginalized limits on all five operators using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for several choices of systematic uncertainties and integrated luminosities.

2025-12-08, **DESI Strong Lens Foundry V: A Sample of HST-Observed Strong Lenses Modeled with GIGA-Lens**, Xiaosheng Huang et.al., [2512.07823v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07823v1)

 We present six galaxy-scale strong lenses with HST imaging modeled using GIGA-Lens. This is Paper V of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry series. These systems were discovered in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using ML/AI methods and confirmed with DESI, Keck/NIRES, and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. They span $z\_d = 0.39 - 1.1$ and $z\_s = 1.4 - 3.3$. This is the first HST strong lens sample modeled with full forward modeling -- all lens and source parameters sampled simultaneously in a single inference -- with explicit convergence validation using both $\widehat{R}$ and effective sample size (ESS) for each system. All inferred parameters satisfy $\widehat{R} < 1.1$ and ${\rm ESS} \gtrsim 10,000$, demonstrating that GIGA-Lens achieves statistically robust inference even for some of the most complex galaxy-scale lenses known. These results pave the way for scaling to much larger, high-resolution strong lens samples from HST, Euclid, JWST, and Roman. Convergence-validated modeling will be critical for key science goals, including constraining the mass-density profile of galaxies, detecting low-mass dark matter (sub)halos, and delivering precise and accurate cosmological constraints.

2025-12-08, **Orbital dynamics and spin-precession around a circular chiral vorton**, S. M. Holme et.al., [2512.07364v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07364v1)

 Vortons are of interest in high-energy physics as possible dark matter candidates and as probes of Grand Unified Theories. Using the recently derived weak-field metric for a chiral vorton, we study the dynamics of test particles by analyzing both timelike and null geodesics. We identify several classes of trajectories, including bound precessing orbits, circular orbits, toroidal, and crown-type oscillations, as well as unbound scattering paths. Poincare surfaces of section reveal transitions between regular and chaotic motions that depend sensitively on the vorton tension $Gμ$ and initial conditions. We further compute the Lense-Thirring and general spin-precession frequencies for gyroscopes along Killing trajectories. The resulting precession profiles exhibit several distinct features not present in Kerr black holes but reminiscent of Kerr naked singularities, such as: divergences near the ring core, and multi-minima structures. These dynamical and precessional signatures may offer potential observational pathways for detecting vortons.

2025-12-08, **Dark-pion dark matter beyond leading order: unitarized chiral dynamics**, Yuki Watanabe et.al., [2512.07339v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07339v1)

 Dark pions are promising dark matter candidates, yet most analyses rely on leading-order (LO) chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). Motivated by the fact that, even for QCD pi-pi scattering, LO ChPT near threshold underestimates the isoscalar s-wave amplitude by an O(1) factor relative to high-precision dispersive results, we reassess the phenomenology of dark-pion dark matter in SIMP and WIMP scenarios using the chiral unitary method, a nonperturbative resummation that implements the correct analytic structure with minimal input, and quantify how unitarization modifies the standard LO ChPT picture. We fix the subtraction constant to its natural estimate, interpreted as an effective cutoff at the chiral scale, so that the unitarized amplitudes depend only on the dark-pion mass and decay constant. We show that, depending on the coupling, the unitarized amplitudes develop resonance poles absent at LO, leading to sizable departures in 2-to-2 self-scattering, relevant for SIMP scenarios, and in annihilation including initial-state interaction effects, relevant for WIMP scenarios. These modifications, in turn, affect the viable parameter space. Although the subtraction constant is, from a model-building perspective, merely a parameter, a substantial deviation from its natural value would point to additional elementary resonances with the same quantum numbers.

2025-12-08, **Genesis of Axion Dark Matter via Black Hole and Cosmic String Dynamics**, Ishan Swamy et.al., [2512.07268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07268v1)

 The global $U\_{PQ}(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, proposed to resolve the strong CP problem, predicts the existence of the axion, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson and a leading dark matter candidate. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M\_\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \, \mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature. Further detailed modeling will be necessary to assess the cosmological implications of this mechanism more precisely.

2025-12-08, **Exact solution of the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model with Noether symmetry constraints**, Olga Razina et.al., [2512.07187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07187v1)

 By applying Noether symmetry methods, analytic solutions are obtained for a generalized Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model with a $ξ(φ)f(G)$ component. Variation with respect to the metric, supplemented by small perturbations, produces the equations of motion and the terms that determine the propagation speed of tensor perturbations. The resulting Hubble parameter incorporates contributions from stiff matter and dark energy, the last originating from a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The viability of the model is assessed by using Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and type Ia supernovae data. Best model selection based on information criteria indicates a slight preference for this new framework over the $Λ$ Cold Dark Matter model. Stability of the model follows from the positive speed of sound and absence of ``Ostrogradsky ghosts''. The total equation of state parameter hints towards the presence of a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion at $z\approx 0.66$, corresponding to the transition from matter to dark energy dominance. Early Universe dynamics, derived from the slow-roll parameters, spectral indices, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, are found to be perfectly consistent with observations from Planck 2018 and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.

2025-12-08, **Universal relation involving fundamental modes in two-fluid dark matter admixed neutron stars**, Hajime Sotani et.al., [2512.07105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07105v1)

 We systematically investigate the fundamental oscillation frequencies of dark matter admixed neutron stars, focusing on models with self-interacting fermionic dark matter that couples to normal matter solely through gravity. The analysis is carried out within a two-fluid formalism under the relativistic Cowling approximation, where the perturbation equations follow from the linearized energy-momentum conservation laws of both components. We find that the mass-scaled fundamental frequencies of the nuclear (dark) fluid in dark core (halo) configurations exhibit a remarkably tight correlation with the total stellar compactness. This universality persists across the dark matter parameter space explored in this study and is largely insensitive to the choice of nuclear equation of state. In contrast, we also find the breakdown of such universality with the tidal deformability, i.e, the same frequencies show substantial deviations from universality when expressed in terms of the tidal deformability. These contrasting behaviors highlight possible observational imprints of dark matter in neutron star interiors.

2025-12-07, **Core-halo scaling relations in self-interacting scalar field dark matter**, Jessica N. López-Sánchez et.al., [2512.07020v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07020v1)

 We study the impact of self-interactions on the structure and evolution of scalar field dark matter (SFDM) halos. Using three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson simulations of multiple soliton mergers, we explore both repulsive and attractive regimes across a wide range of scattering lengths. Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo. These results demonstrate that self-interactions provide a natural mechanism to regulate core properties, with important implications for the formation of supermassive black holes and for potential astrophysical signatures in galactic cores.

2025-12-07, **Probing memory-burdened Primordial Black Holes with global 21 cm signal**, Priyanka Sarmah et.al., [2512.06941v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06941v1)

 We investigate the imprints of memory-burdened primordial black holes (PBH) on the global 21 cm signal during the cosmic dawn. Recent studies reopened the possibility of a mass window of PBHs as a compelling candidate for dark matter, particularly in low-mass regimes ($M\_{\text {PBH}}< 10^{15}$ g) where conventional constraints from evaporation are being revisited in light of quantum gravitational effects. One such effect, the \textit{memory burden effect}, slows down black hole evaporation by incorporating the backreaction of radiation on the black hole microstates, substantially extending the lifetime of light PBHs and thus modifying their late-time emission spectra. This prolonged emission can dramatically alter the energy injection history in the early universe. By computing the modified energy injection rates into the intergalactic medium and incorporating them into the thermal and ionization evolution of neutral hydrogen, we obtain projected constraints on the fraction of dark matter. The bounds are obtained from the fact that these low mass PBHs, which were thought otherwise evaporated, can modify the absorption amplitude in the global 21 cm signal at redshift $z\approx17$. Considering the two viable scenarios of transition to the memory-burden phase: fast (or instantaneous) and slow (transition with a finite width), we show how the 21 cm bounds are sensitive to different mass ranges. For a broad transition with $δ=10^{-2}$ we find that PBHs in the mass range $M\_{\rm PBH}\simeq10^{8}$-$10^{13}$ g are excluded at the level of $f\_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim10^{-8}$. In contrast, for a fast-transition case ($k=1$), the evaporation is suppressed so efficiently that no meaningful 21 cm constraint remains for $M\_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim10^{7}$ g.

2025-12-07, **Revisiting black holes in dark-matter halos: on consistent solutions to the Einstein equations**, S. V. Bolokhov et.al., [2512.06930v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06930v1)

 A number of recent papers have claimed to construct solutions of Einstein's equations describing black holes surrounded by dark-matter halos with empirically motivated density profiles such as the Navarro-Frenk-White, Burkert, Einasto, pseudo-isothermal, and solitonic distributions. We show that the approach used to obtain many of these metrics generically does not lead to the correct solutions to the Einstein equations for the matter sources they purport to represent. This issue originates from applying the Newtonian relation between the tangential velocity and the enclosed mass directly within a relativistic framework, followed by the ad hoc assumption $g(r)=f(r)$ for the metric functions. This procedure leads to an anisotropic fluid with $P\_r=-ρ$ and $P\_t=-rρ'/2-ρ$, whose density differs from the claimed halo profile and often becomes non-physical near the horizon, violating the weak energy condition. As a result, the obtained spacetimes do not describe black holes embedded in known galactic halos but rather distinct anisotropic configurations unrelated to the intended matter distribution. We demonstrate this problem on several representative examples from the literature, including metrics based on the NFW, Burkert, Einasto, solitonic, pseudo-isothermal, and Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) profiles, as well as the case of the NGC~4649 halo. For each case, the correct Einstein-consistent form of the metric and the associated physical interpretation are provided. Our analysis clarifies the limits of validity of the Newtonian approximation near compact objects and establishes a consistent framework for constructing dark-matter-inspired black-hole geometries within General Relativity.

2025-12-07, **Extreme mass ratio inspirals in the cold vector dark matter environment**, Rajesh Karmakar et.al., [2512.06807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06807v1)

 With regard to the observed dark matter density profile in galaxies and clusters, the scalar dark matter scenario has been previously studied for potential detectability through gravitational wave observations at measurable signal-to-noise ratios. In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $μ\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M\_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M\_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.

2025-12-07, **An Extended WZDR Model with Interacting Scalar Field Dark Matter and Stepped Dark Radiation**, Gang Liu et.al., [2512.06719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06719v1)

 In this paper, we explore the interaction between scalar field dark matter and stepped dark radiation as an extension of the WZDR model. The supersymmetry-based WZDR framework has demonstrated considerable potential in alleviating the Hubble tension. Previous investigations have examined the interaction between stepped dark radiation and cold dark matter, with the aim of simultaneously addressing both the Hubble and $S\_8$ tensions. Given the suppressive effect of scalar field dark matter on small-scale structure growth, we replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter in the present work and introduce its interaction with stepped dark radiation via pure momentum coupling, thereby formulating a novel coupling model. We impose constraints on the model parameters using a variety of cosmological datasets, including the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, $H\_0$ measurements from SH0ES, $S\_8$ data from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, and data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Our analysis reveals that the performance of the new model is nearly identical to that of the original WZDR model, with only a marginal improvement. When using the full data combination, the best-fit values for $H\_0$ in the coupled model and WZDR model are 70.89 km/s/Mpc and 70.68 km/s/Mpc, respectively. For the $S\_8$ parameter, the new model results in a decrease from 0.8136 in the original model to 0.8113. Furthermore, the coupling signal remains weak, with the constraint on the coupling parameter being $\log\_{10}(ξ)<4.56$. While the coupling model offers some improvement, it does not fully resolve the cosmological tensions, indicating that further investigation is required to address these issues.

2025-12-07, **Masked Autoencoder Pretraining on Strong-Lensing Images for Joint Dark-Matter Model Classification and Super-Resolution**, Achmad Ardani Prasha et.al., [2512.06642v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06642v1)

 Strong gravitational lensing can reveal the influence of dark-matter substructure in galaxies, but analyzing these effects from noisy, low-resolution images poses a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on simulated strong-lensing images from the DeepLense ML4SCI benchmark to learn generalizable representations for two downstream tasks: (i) classifying the underlying dark matter model (cold dark matter, axion-like, or no substructure) and (ii) enhancing low-resolution lensed images via super-resolution. We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%). For super-resolution (16x16 to 64x64), the MAE-pretrained model reconstructs images with PSNR ~33 dB and SSIM 0.961, modestly improving over scratch training. We ablate the MAE mask ratio, revealing a consistent trade-off: higher mask ratios improve classification but slightly degrade reconstruction fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that MAE pretraining on physics-rich simulations provides a flexible, reusable encoder for multiple strong-lensing analysis tasks.

2025-12-08, **ZTF-SEDm Type Ia supernova sample for Twins Embedding spectrophotometric standardisation**, C. Ganot et.al., [2512.07696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07696v1)

 This paper has two aims: the first one is to build a large homogeneous spectrophotometric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, using 3069 spectra from the second Zwicky Transient Facility data release (ZTF DR2). Using this sample we reproduce, as the second objective of the paper, the Twins Embedding (TE) spectrophotometric standardisation method, which led to an exceptionally low value of 0.073 mag for the intrinsic scatter. We improve the flux-calibration accuracy of the SEDm SN Ia spectral sample using the ZTF photometric data, which are calibrated at the percent level. We then apply the three steps of the TE parameterisation to a subset of 783 ZTF SN spectra near maximum light, and analyse the resulting standardisation methods. The precision of the phase correction model, which is the first step of the TE, is estimated at 0.01 mag in g band, using ZTF data. Despite the challenge posed by the ZTF spectrum extraction pipeline, we apply a first standardisation in color based on the second step of the TE, the Read Between The Lines (RBTL). When considering the scatter due to the redshift error and the flux calibration error, we estimate a 0.129 mag Hubble residual scatter for this ZTF sample as an upper limit. As expected from the low spectral quality, the final TE standardisation based on three non-linear parameters did not improve the overall dispersion. We release 1897 flux calibrated spectra of 1607 SNe Ia with an estimated photometric accuracy of 0.07 mag. We further demonstrate the ability to apply a spectrophotometric standardisation with limited quality spectra. The RBTL standardisation is more efficient than that of SALT with one less parameter, and the resulting host steps are consistent with zero, making it less prone to astrophysical bias. For future spectroscopic surveys, a better spectral quality would enable the full TE standardisation to be computed. (Abridged)

2025-12-08, **Chemical complexity in star formation induced by stellar feedback: cores shock-formed by the supernova remnant W44**, G. Cosentino et.al., [2512.07562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07562v1)

 Low-velocity shocks from Supernova Remnants (SNRs) may set the physical and chemical conditions of star formation in molecular clouds. Recent evidence suggests that the Sun might have formed through this process. However, the chemical conditions of shock-induced star forming region remain poorly constrained. We study the chemical complexity of a shock-impacted clump, with potential to yield star formation, named the Clump, and located at the interface between the SNR W44 and the infrared dark cloud G034.77-00.55. We test whether the Clump has chemical properties consistent with those observed in star forming regions unaffected by SNRs. We use high-sensitivity, broad spectral surveys at 3 and 7 mm obtained with the 30m antenna at IIRAM and the 40 m YEBES antenna, to identify D-bearing species and complex organic molecules (COMs) toward the Clump. For all species, we estimate molecular abundances and compare them with those observed across star forming regions at different evolutionary stages and masses, as well as comets. We detect multiple deuterated molecules (DCO+, DNC, DCN, CH2DOH) and COMs (CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3CCH, CH3CN, CH3SH) with excitation temperatures of 5-13 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of COMs toward a site of SNR-cloud interaction. The derived D/H ratios (0.01-0.04) and COM abundances are consistent with those reported toward typical low-mass starless cores and comparable to cometary values. The overall level of chemical complexity is relatively low, in line with an early evolutionary stage. We suggest that the Clump is a early stage shock-induced low-mass star forming region, not yet protostellar. We speculate that SNR shocks may set the physical and chemical conditions to form stars. The resulting chemical budget may be preserved along the formation process of a planetary system, being finally incorporated into planetesimals and cometesimals.

2025-12-08, **Dynamical Dark Energy and the Unresolved Hubble Tension: Multi-model Constraints from DESI 2025 and Other Probes**, Zhuoming Zhang et.al., [2512.07281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07281v1)

 We present a Bayesian comparative analysis of five cosmological models: $Λ$CDM, $w$CDM, $w\_0w\_a$CDM, $φ$CDM (with scalar-field dark energy), and an interacting dark energy scenario (the $ξ$ model), to investigate dark energy evolution and the Hubble tension. Utilizing the latest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, BAO), Pantheon+ (Type Ia Supernovae, SNIa), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data (including lensing) from \textit{Planck} and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), we report three key findings. First, the Hubble constant ($H\_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w < -1$), while late-universe (BAO/SNIa) data prefer quintessence ($w > -1$). Third, the full dataset suggests a late-time interaction between dark energy and matter. Our results demonstrate that dark energy evolves with cosmic time, challenging the cosmological constant paradigm.

2025-12-08, **Interplay between Escaping Cosmic Rays and Interstellar Medium: Driving of Galactic Winds and Shaping the Local Proton Spectrum**, Jiro Shimoda et.al., [2512.07239v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07239v1)

 We study the effects of escaping cosmic rays (CRs) on the interstellar medium (ISM) around their source with spherically symmetric CR-hydrodynamical simulations taking into account the evolution of the CR energy spectrum, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. We show how the escaping CRs accelerate and heat the ISM fluid depending on the CR diffusion coefficient. The CR heating effects are potentially responsible for the recent observations of the unexpected H$α$ and [OIII]$λ$5007 lines in old supernova remnants. The implied gas outflow by CRs can be comparable to the Galactic star formation rate, compatible with the Galactic wind required for the metal-polluted halo gas and the production of eROSITA bubbles. Assuming a locally suppressed CR diffusion and a few nearby CR sources in the Local Bubble, we also propose alternative interpretations for the Galactic CR proton spectrum around the Earth measured with CALET, AMS02, and Voyager I.

2025-12-08, **Exact solution of the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model with Noether symmetry constraints**, Olga Razina et.al., [2512.07187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07187v1)

 By applying Noether symmetry methods, analytic solutions are obtained for a generalized Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model with a $ξ(φ)f(G)$ component. Variation with respect to the metric, supplemented by small perturbations, produces the equations of motion and the terms that determine the propagation speed of tensor perturbations. The resulting Hubble parameter incorporates contributions from stiff matter and dark energy, the last originating from a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The viability of the model is assessed by using Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and type Ia supernovae data. Best model selection based on information criteria indicates a slight preference for this new framework over the $Λ$ Cold Dark Matter model. Stability of the model follows from the positive speed of sound and absence of ``Ostrogradsky ghosts''. The total equation of state parameter hints towards the presence of a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion at $z\approx 0.66$, corresponding to the transition from matter to dark energy dominance. Early Universe dynamics, derived from the slow-roll parameters, spectral indices, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, are found to be perfectly consistent with observations from Planck 2018 and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.

2025-12-08, **Evidence of young magnetars in massive binary embedded in a supernova remnant as sources of active fast radio bursts**, F. Y. Wang et.al., [2512.07140v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07140v1)

 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intense pulses with unknown origins. A subclass of repeating FRBs show some common features, such as associated compact persistent radio sources (PRSs), high burst rates, and large host-galaxy dispersion measures (DMs). Meanwhile, they show diverse DM and rotation measure (RM) variations, which cannot be explained by current models. A unified model urgently needs to be established. Here we show the first evidence for a supernova remnant surrounding the FRB 20190520B source. We then demonstrate that the five active repeating FRB sources associated with PRSs can be understood within a single model in which central objects are young magnetars in massive binary systems embedded in supernova remnants. This model naturally predicts distinct variations of DM and RM for repeating FRBs. Crucially, young magnetar wind nebulae can generate bright PRSs. As a magnetar becomes older, the luminosity of a PRS will fade, which can naturally explain less-luminous PRSs for some active FRBs. Our results support a unified population of active FRBs in dynamic magnetized environments.

2025-12-08, **Trends in gravitational wave emission in axisymmetric simulations of rotating core-collapse supernovae**, Bailey Sykes et.al., [2512.07066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07066v1)

 The quantitative impact of strong rotation on the amplitudes and frequencies of the post-bounce gravitational wave (GW) signal from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is still not fully understood. To study trends in frequencies and amplitudes, and possibly spectacular phenomena like resonant amplification, we perform a series of axisymmetric long-duration magnetohydrodynamic CCSN simulations of a 17 $M\_\odot$ progenitor using a finely spaced grid in initial rotation rate from 0.29 rad/s to 3.48 rad/s. We find that these rotating models produce GWs at frequencies of up to 3 kHz, higher than in typical non-rotating models in the literature. The high frequencies arise due to small polar radii of rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars and stabilization by angular momentum gradients at lower latitude. GW frequencies and amplitudes tend to decrease with faster rotation. Different from two complementary simulations without magnetic fields, the magnetohydrodynamic models are characterized by an absence of p-modes above the dominant high-frequency emission band. We find no indication of resonant mode amplification for any rotation rate, although a temporo-spatial and space-frequency analysis reveals some interesting couplings of quadrupolar motions across the proto-neutron star and the gain region. We find that linear mode analysis based on the spherically averaged structure becomes unsuitable in this regime of rapid rotation. More advanced perturbative techniques need to be developed to study the mode structure and mode interaction in the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars.

2025-12-07, **Giant outbursts of clumpy material preceding Type II supernova 2024qiw**, T. Nagao et.al., [2512.07049v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07049v1)

 Observations of core-collapse supernovae suggest that some massive stars undergo intense mass loss shortly before explosion, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report evidence of giant outbursts of clumpy material from a massive star in the final decades before explosion. Photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric data of SN~2024qiw reveal a bumpy light curve, a broad H$α$ profile, and variable polarization, all consistent with interaction between SN ejecta and clumpy circumstellar material, implying a mass-loss rate of $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Taken together, the most likely explanation is multiple major eruptions, similar to those of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), but occurring shortly before explosion. This challenges standard stellar evolution theory by requiring either that LBVs explode terminally, or that other evolutionary phases produce eruptive episodes. In spite of very high pre-SN mass loss, the resulting SN is of Type~II, rather than Type IIn, highlighting diverse and previously unrecognized late-stage mass-loss processes.

2025-12-07, **An Extended WZDR Model with Interacting Scalar Field Dark Matter and Stepped Dark Radiation**, Gang Liu et.al., [2512.06719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06719v1)

 In this paper, we explore the interaction between scalar field dark matter and stepped dark radiation as an extension of the WZDR model. The supersymmetry-based WZDR framework has demonstrated considerable potential in alleviating the Hubble tension. Previous investigations have examined the interaction between stepped dark radiation and cold dark matter, with the aim of simultaneously addressing both the Hubble and $S\_8$ tensions. Given the suppressive effect of scalar field dark matter on small-scale structure growth, we replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter in the present work and introduce its interaction with stepped dark radiation via pure momentum coupling, thereby formulating a novel coupling model. We impose constraints on the model parameters using a variety of cosmological datasets, including the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, $H\_0$ measurements from SH0ES, $S\_8$ data from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, and data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Our analysis reveals that the performance of the new model is nearly identical to that of the original WZDR model, with only a marginal improvement. When using the full data combination, the best-fit values for $H\_0$ in the coupled model and WZDR model are 70.89 km/s/Mpc and 70.68 km/s/Mpc, respectively. For the $S\_8$ parameter, the new model results in a decrease from 0.8136 in the original model to 0.8113. Furthermore, the coupling signal remains weak, with the constraint on the coupling parameter being $\log\_{10}(ξ)<4.56$. While the coupling model offers some improvement, it does not fully resolve the cosmological tensions, indicating that further investigation is required to address these issues.
