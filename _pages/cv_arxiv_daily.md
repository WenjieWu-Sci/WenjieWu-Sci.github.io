2025-09-18, **Lepton models from non-holomorphic $A^{\prime}_{5}$ modular flavor symmetry**, Cai-Chang Li et.al., [2509.15183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15183v1)

 In the framework of non-holomorphic modular invariance approach, we have systematically constructed all minimal lepton models based on the non-holomorphic $A^{\prime}\_{5}$ modular symmetry from a bottom-up approach. In these models, the Yukawa couplings are described by polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms of integer weights at level $N=5$. Under the assumption of Majorana neutrinos, both the Weinberg operator and the type-I seesaw mechanism are considered for neutrino mass generation. All minimal models are found to be based on generalized CP (gCP) symmetry, and each of them depends on five real dimensionless parameters and two overall scales. Through comprehensive numerical scanning, we obtain 6 (4) phenomenologically viable Weinberg operator models and 94 (76) phenomenologically viable seesaw models for normal (inverted) ordering neutrino masses. For each viable model, we present predictions for key neutrino properties, such as lepton masses, CP violation phases, mixing angles, effective Majorana mass for neutrinoless double beta decay and the kinematical mass in beta decay. Furthermore, we provide detailed numerical analysis for two representative models to illustrate our results.

2025-09-18, **Hunting the elusive $X17$ in CE$ν$NS at the ESS**, Joakim Cederkäll et.al., [2509.15128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15128v1)

 The so-called $X17$ particle has been proposed in order to explain a very significant resonant behaviour (in both the angular separation and invariant mass) of $e^+e^-$ pairs produced during a nuclear transition of excited $^8$Be, $^4$He and $^{12}$C nuclei. Fits to the corresponding data point, as most probable explanation, to a spin-1 object, which is protophobic and has a mass of approximately 16.7 MeV, which then makes the $X17$ potentially observable in Coherent Elastic neutrino ($\nu$) Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) at the European Spallation Source (ESS). By adopting as theoretical framework a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a generic $U(1)'$ gauge group mixing with the hypercharge one of the latter, which can naturally accommodate the $X17$ state compliant with all available measurements from a variety of experiments, we predict that CE$\nu$NS at the ESS will constitute an effective means to probe this hypothesis, even after allowing for the inevitable systematics associated to the performance of the planned detectors therein.

2025-09-18, **Exponential quintessence with momentum coupling to dark matter**, Alkistis Pourtsidou et.al., [2509.15091v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15091v1)

 We present updated constraints on an interacting dark energy - dark matter model with pure momentum transfer, where dark energy is in the form of a quintessence scalar field with an exponential potential. We run a suite of MCMC analyses using the DESI DR2 BAO measurements, in combination with CMB data from Planck and supernovae data from DESY5. In contrast to the standard case of uncoupled quintessence, we find that values for the potential's slope parameter $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$, which are conjectured by string theory scenarios, are not excluded. If $\lambda$ is fixed to such a value, we find that the data favour the negative coupling branch of the model, which is the branch exhibiting late-time growth suppression. We also derive 95% upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses, finding $\sum m\_\nu < 0.06$ eV ($\sum m\_\nu < 0.16$ eV) when $\lambda$ is fixed (varied). Our results motivate further studies on dynamical dark energy models that obey string theory bounds and can be constrained with cosmological observations.

2025-09-18, **Constraining gamma-ray burst parameters with the first ultra-high energy neutrino event KM3-230213A**, KM3NeT Collaboration et.al., [2509.14895v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14895v1)

 Context: The detection of the highest energy neutrino observed to date by KM3NeT, with an estimated energy of 220 PeV, opens up new possibilities for the study and identification of the astrophysical sources responsible for a diffuse flux of such ultra-high-energy neutrinos, among which gamma-ray bursts are longstanding candidates.   Aims: Based on the event KM3-230213A, we derive constraints on the baryon loading and density of the surrounding environment in models of blastwaves in long-duration gamma-ray bursts.   Methods: We compute the diffuse flux from gamma-ray burst blastwaves, either expanding in a constant density interstellar medium or developing in a radially decreasing density of a wind-like environment surrounding the gamma-ray burst progenitor star, by taking into account the expected neutrino spectra and luminosity function. We use a Poisson likelihood method to constrain the blastwave model parameters by calculating the expected number of neutrino events within the 90% confidence level energy range of KM3-230213A and by using the joint exposure of KM3NeT/ARCA, IceCube and Pierre Auger.   Results: We constrain the baryon loading to be $\leq \{392, 131, 39, 13\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is inversely proportional to a varying interstellar medium particle density of $\{1, 3, 10, 30\}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the wind-like environment case, the baryon loading is $\leq \{20, 50, 100\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is proportional to the sixth power of a varying density parameter of $\{0.05, 0.06, 0.07\}$.

2025-09-18, **Diffuse emission from stochastic sources**, Anton Stall et.al., [2509.14776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14776v1)

 Diffuse emission in gamma-rays and neutrinos are produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium. Below some hundreds of TeV, the sources of these cosmic rays are most likely Galactic. Hence, observations of high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos can be used to probe the flux of cosmic rays in other parts of the Galaxy. Supernova remnants are usually considered as the prime candidate for the acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays. They inject cosmic rays in a point-like and specific time-dependent manner. As the precise positions and ages of the sources are not known, predictions must be obtained in a stochastic model. At GeV energies, the distribution of sources can be approximated with a smoothly varying spatial and temporal source density. At hundreds of TeV, however, the point-like nature matters as less sources contribute effectively due to shorter escape times. We have modelled diffuse emissions at hundreds of TeV, relevant for measurements by LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube, and the upcoming SWGO, as well as at tens of GeV, as measured by Fermi-LAT. This reveals the distinctive nature of diffuse emissions at the respective energies which can likely be used to constrain source models and locate cosmic ray sources.

2025-09-18, **The Stochastic Dissipation Model for the Steady State Neutrino and Multi-Wavelength Emission of TXS 0506+056**, Zhen-Jie Wang et.al., [2509.14587v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14587v1)

 The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been suggested to be a potential high-energy neutrino source thanks to the observations of IceCube, which found outburst-like neutrino emissions during 2014-2015 and 2017 in the transient emission search, and a $3.5\sigma$ local significance in a 10-year time-integrated search. The conventional one-zone jet model cannot explain the observed neutrino flux during outbursts due to the constraint from the X-ray flux, leading to proposals of multi-zone models (e.g. two-zone model) with multiple radiation zones. In literature, it has been shown that multi-zone models may consistently explain the high-state neutrino emission and the multi-wavelength emission of TXS 0506+056, while the quasi-steady-state long-term emission has not been well studied. In this work, we investigate a physically based model for the quasi-steady-state neutrino and electromagnetic radiation under the same framework, and successfully reproduce the multi-messenger emission of TXS 0506+056.

2025-09-18, **Linear seesaw leptogenesis before/after electroweak symmetry breaking**, Yan Shao et.al., [2509.14524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14524v1)

 The linear seesaw (LSS) model provides a natural framework for generating small neutrino masses at low energy scales, thereby offering promising testability prospects. However, in generic LSS models, the exact mass degeneracy (before the electroweak symmetry breaking) between the two sterile neutrinos that form a Dirac pair precludes the generation of CP asymmetries from their interplay, posing a significant challenge to explaining the observed baryon (or lepton) asymmetry of the Universe via the leptogenesis mechanism. In this work, we explore two well-motivated approaches to generate a suitable mass splitting for the two sterile neutrinos that form a Dirac pair, and consequently naturally realize a resonantly enhanced generation of baryon (and lepton) asymmetry. First, we demonstrate that the renormalization group evolution effects can naturally induce the desired mass splitting for the sterile neutrinos, resulting in a successful generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Second, motivated by the recent result from the EMPRESS collaboration that indicates the possible existence of a large lepton asymmetry of the Universe, we explore the possibility that a large lepton asymmetry might naturally follow from the electroweak symmetry breaking which automatically induces the desired mass splitting for the sterile neutrinos.

2025-09-17, **Study of an Isolated Double-pulse Cosmic Ray Candidate Recorded with the Askaryan Radio Array**, Shoukat Ali et.al., [2509.14407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14407v1)

 The radio-frequency emissions produced by particle showers on Earth, resulting from cosmic rays (CRs) and ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHE-$\nu$) originating from astrophysical sources share significant similarities, enabling radio detectors initially designed for UHE-$\nu$ searches to also study CRs. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), an experiment currently operating within the ice at the South Pole, is primarily designed to detect UHE-$\nu$s. To date, ARA has deployed five stations, with each station equipped with antennas installed at depths up to 200 meters in the ice. Data recorded by ARA Station-2 (A2) suggest a potential CR origin for a subset of events identified in a UHE-$\nu$ search. This subset includes a double-pulse event potentially from a downward propagating CR-induced air shower, with in-air geomagnetic emission followed by in-ice Askaryan emission producing the two pulses. A detailed investigation of this CR candidate event using comprehensive simulations has been conducted with the goal of identifying the parameters of a CR-induced air shower that best match the experimentally observed quantities. We simulate predicted CR signals in ARA by combining an impacting CR shower simulation framework (FAERIE) with a realistic detector simulation (AraSim).   We determine the event topology based on the vertex reconstruction of both the putative geomagnetic and Askaryan signals. After inferring the event geometry, we show that the simulation matches the observed time structure of the event (channel-by-channel relative signal arrival times) for the recorded event.

2025-09-17, **Telescope Tilt System for the POEMMA Balloon Radio Mission**, Lawrence Wiencke et.al., [2509.14333v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14333v1)

 The Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics Balloon with Radio mission (PBR) will point above Earth's limb to measure PeV energy cosmic rays, and record star images to monitor optical focusing in situ. PBR will point below Earth's limb to search for earth-skimming neutrinos. PBR will also measure EeV energy cosmic rays by tilting as far down as the nadir direction. All of these searches will require changing and measuring the tilt angle of a single large integrated telescope and radio antenna assembly in the near space environment at 33 km above sea level over a mission duration as long as 50 days. In addition, the 1.1 m diameter entrance pupil of the telescope will be covered during the day by a shutter system to prevent sunlight from damaging the camera systems and opened at night to collect data. Here we present the design and status of the tilting system, the tilting monitors, the shutter system, the controller, and the preflight thermal vacuum testing process. The work draws on the experience of the 2023 Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 mission.

2025-09-17, **SkyNET-scape Room: An Escape Room to Explore Astroparticle Physics**, Elisa Prandini et.al., [2509.14190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14190v1)

 Innovative science communication is key to engaging the public with complex topics such as astroparticle physics. As part of the Italian PRIN 2022 funding initiative, we are developing SkyNET-scape Room, an interactive escape room designed to introduce participants to the main messengers of the high-energy universe, namely cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos.   The experience is structured into three interactive stations, each focusing on a specific messenger and its detection method. Small teams of visitors will collaborate to solve puzzles and quizzes related to gamma-ray observations, neutrino detection, and cosmic-ray composition. Using a combination of audio, video, and written materials, participants will engage with real scientific concepts while working together to "escape." The ultimate goal is to spark curiosity, teamwork, and excitement for science, making astroparticle physics more accessible and engaging.   In this contribution, we will present the design, implementation, and preliminary feedback from test sessions, emphasizing how gamification and interactive storytelling can serve as powerful tools for public engagement.

2025-09-17, **Long-Lived Particles from Meson and Muon Decays at Rest at Spallation Sources**, Matheus Hostert et.al., [2509.14085v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14085v1)

 We provide a systematic survey of spallation sources around the world and their potential to search for new light particles. We study the sensitivity of existing neutrino detectors to the decay in flight of light particles produced in the decay at rest of pions, muons, and kaons. At J-PARC, we show that the magnetized gaseous argon detectors of ND280 could place leading limits on light particles decaying to $e^+e^-$ and that the liquid-scintillator detectors of the J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at the JSNS (JSNS$^2$) experiment can exploit double- and triple-coincidence signals from $\mu^+\mu^-$ and $\pi^+\pi^-$ to place new limits on particles produced in kaon decay. We find that the Coherent Captain Mills detector at Los Alamos and the suite of COHERENT detectors at Oak Ridge, despite their smaller size, would also have a promising sensitivity to particles produced in pion and muon decays, depending on background levels. Spallation sources have the potential to explore more than an order of magnitude beyond current constraints in some new physics models, encouraging further study on data acquisition and background rejection by experimental collaborations.

2025-09-17, **MEC-induced two-nucleon emission in neutrino-nucleus scattering**, M. B. Barbaro et.al., [2509.13915v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13915v1)

 Meson-exchange currents (MEC) play a crucial role in the nuclear response to a leptonic probe, inducing the emission of two nucleons, the so-called 2p2h excitations. Here we report the results of our recent work \cite{Belocchi:2025eix}, in which we evaluated the 2p2h contribution to the $(\nu\_\mu,\mu^-p)$ neutrino cross section off a carbon target, which involves the simultaneous detection the outgoing muon and a proton in the final state. This process has recently been measured in long-baseline neutrino experiments, but no truly microscopic calculation for the 2p2h channel existed to be compared with these data until now. The calculation employs fully relativistic two-body currents and is carried out within the Relativistic Fermi Gas framework. It provides a generalization to the weak sector of the electromagnetic inclusive model developed in Ref.~\cite{DePace:2003spn} and an extension of the calculation to enable semi-inclusive predictions. A selection of our results for the semi-inclusive cross section versus the emitted proton variables is presented, both at fixed neutrino energy and folded with the T2K muon-neutrino flux.

2025-09-17, **Scheduling follow-up observations of energetic transients with the neutrino target scheduler (NuTS)**, Tobias Heibges et.al., [2509.13844v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13844v1)

 Space missions offer unique opportunities for studying ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays and neutrinos by leveraging secondary emissions generated by extensive air showers (EAS) resulting from their interactions with the atmosphere or Earth's crust. Detecting UHE neutrinos associated with transient sources holds great potential for unraveling the origins of UHE cosmic rays and the physical processes driving their production. Stratospheric balloon missions, illustrated recently by the Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon II Mission, serve as crucial precursors to space missions. Due to slewing abilities of their telescopes, they can perform follow-up observations of transient sources foreseen as potential candidates for detectable UHE neutrino emissions. Strategies tailored to stratospheric and space missions are essential for optimizing follow-up observations aimed at detecting these elusive neutrinos for the first time. To address this challenge, we have developed a flexible software dedicated to scheduling transient source observations. The software comprises three main modules: a listener module that aggregates alerts from existing alert systems to construct a comprehensive source database, an observability module that factors in the detection system's properties and trajectory to determine a list of observable sources during a specific timeframe, and a scheduler module that prioritizes observations and proposes an optimized observation schedule. The initial release of the neutrino target scheduler software is tailored to the requirements of stratospheric balloon missions, with mock observation examples provided for various flight scenarios. This version will be employed for the upcoming PBR flight in 2027. Future developments will extend its capabilities, and ensure its relevance for various types of missions.

2025-09-17, **Polar Mounds on Strangeon Stars: the Neutrino Emission from Ultraluminous X-ray Pulsars**, Hong-Bo Li et.al., [2509.13732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13732v1)

 Ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) serve as unique astrophysical laboratories, offering critical insights into accretion physics under extreme conditions, such as strong magnetic fields and super-Eddington accretion rates. Additionally, the nature of pulsars, i.e., the equation of state of supranuclear matter, is still a matter of intense debate, basing on either conventional neutron stars or strange stars in the litterateurs. In this work, we investigate accretion columns of ULXPs based on the strangeon-star model, focusing on the thermal mound at the column base. Accounting for Coulomb and strangeness barriers of the strangeon stars, we find that the mound can reach $0.7-0.95\,\rm km$ in height with temperatures above $10^9\, \rm K$, enabling substantial neutrino emission via electron-positron annihilation. Heat transport along the strangeon star surface contributes a luminosity of $10^{36} \, \rm erg\, s^{-1} $, independent of the accretion rate. At low accretion rates ($< 10^{20}\, \rm g\,s^{-1}$), photons dominate the luminosity, while at higher rates ($> 10^{21}\, \rm g\, s^{-1}$), photon trapping makes neutrino emission the main cooling channel, with total luminosity exceeding photon emission, which saturates near $10^{41}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Estimating neutrino fluxes at Earth, we find that only the nearest ULXP, Swift J0243.6$+$6124, could produce a marginally detectable signal, while most extragalactic sources remain well below background levels. These results emphasize the key role of the thermal mound and strangeon star properties in determining accretion luminosities and neutrino emission, offering insights for future modeling and observations of ULXPs.

2025-09-18, **Parameter sensitivity of cosmic pairwise velocities in the non-linear regime of structure formation**, Jorge Enrique García-Farieta et.al., [2509.15223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15223v1)

 The peculiar velocities of dark matter tracers drive the growth of cosmic structures, providing a sensitive test of cosmological models and strengthening constraints on the nature of dark energy. In this work, we investigate the mean pairwise velocities, $v\_{12}$, of dark matter tracers as a cosmological probe in the non-linear regime of cosmic structure formation. Using N-body dark matter-only simulations, we measure $v\_{12}$ for pair separations up to 50 $h^{-1}$Mpc and model it by solving the pair conservation equation for a self-gravitating particle system, along with various prescriptions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. We quantified the sensitivity of $v\_{12}$ to variations in key cosmological parameters such as $\Omega\_{\mathrm{m}}$, $\sigma\_8$, $h$, $M\_\nu$, and $w$. Our parameter inference analysis using MCMC shows sub-11% agreement with simulation data, with notable degeneracies, particularly between $\Omega\_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma\_8$. We further compute the stable clustering crossing scale across redshifts $z=0$, $0.5$, and $1$, assessing its dependence on cosmology. Among the tested power spectrum modeling approaches, we find that the CSSTEmu emulator provides the most accurate predictions, with deviations below 5% for $r > 10$ $h^{-1}$Mpc at $z=0.5$. Our results are validated using independent simulation suites, demonstrating that our framework offers a robust method for extracting cosmological constraints from upcoming peculiar velocity data.

2025-09-18, **Shedding Light on Dark Matter at the LHC with Machine Learning**, Ernesto Arganda et.al., [2509.15121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15121v1)

 We investigate a WIMP dark matter (DM) candidate in the form of a singlino-dominated lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) within the $Z\_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. This framework gives rise to regions of parameter space where DM is obtained via co-annihilation with nearby higgsino-like electroweakinos and DM direct detection~signals are suppressed, the so-called ``blind spots". On the other hand, collider signatures remain promising due to enhanced radiative decay modes of higgsinos into the singlino-dominated LSP and a photon, rather than into leptons or hadrons. This motivates searches for radiatively decaying neutralinos, however, these signals face substantial background challenges, as the decay products are typically soft due to the small mass-splits ($\Delta m$) between the LSP and the higgsino-like coannihilation partners. We apply a data-driven Machine Learning (ML) analysis that improves sensitivity to these subtle signals, offering a powerful complement to traditional search strategies to discover a new physics scenario. Using an LHC integrated luminosity of $100~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $14~\mathrm{TeV}$, the method achieves a $5\sigma$ discovery reach for higgsino masses up to $225~\mathrm{GeV}$ with $\Delta m\!\lesssim\!12~\mathrm{GeV}$, and a $2\sigma$ exclusion up to $285~\mathrm{GeV}$ with $\Delta m\!\lesssim\!20~\mathrm{GeV}$. These results highlight the power of collider searches to probe DM candidates that remain hidden from current direct detection experiments, and provide a motivation for a search by the LHC collaborations using ML methods.

2025-09-18, **Magnetic-Field and Temperature Limits of a Kinetic-Inductance Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier**, Lucas M. Janssen et.al., [2509.15043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15043v1)

 Kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) offer broadband near-quantum-limited amplification with high saturation power. Due to the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials, KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground plane) while $\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the search for axion dark matter.

2025-09-18, **A dark energy model for coasting cosmology**, Yunliang Ren et.al., [2509.15039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15039v1)

 Coasting cosmology offers an intriguing and straightforward framework for understanding the universe. In this work, we employ the Trans-Planckian Censorship Criterion (TCC) conjecture to test the viability of the coasting cosmology and propose an entropic dark energy (EDE) model within this framework. By applying the holographic principle to constrain the dark energy density and adopting the Bekenstein entropy and Tsallis entropy as the constraining entropies of the system, we find that, in a holographic coasting cosmological framework where dark energy and dark matter evolve independently, the Tsallis entropy satisfies certain general assumptions better than the Bekenstein entropy. Thus, there may be a fundamental relationship between Tsallis entropy and dark energy. We utilize observational data from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) to constrain EDE model. The optimal Tsallis parameter obtained aligns well with theoretical expectations. To evaluate the model's fit to the observed data, we calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Kullback Information Criterion (KIC), and compare these metrics with those derived from $\Lambda$CDM, under which the model shows some improvement. Overall, this model provides a novel and simple on the evolution of the universe.

2025-09-18, **HerS-3: An Exceptional Einstein Cross Reveals a Massive Dark Matter Halo**, P. Cox et.al., [2509.14983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14983v1)

 We present a study of HerS-3, a dusty star-forming galaxy at zspec = 3.0607, which is gravitationally amplified into an Einstein cross with a fifth image of the background galaxy seen at the center of the cross. Detailed 1-mm spectroscopy and imaging with NOEMA and ALMA resolve the individual images and show that each of the five images display a series of molecular lines that have similar central velocities, unambiguously confirming that they have identical redshifts. The HST F110W image reveals a foreground lensing group of four galaxies with a photometric redshift zphot~1.0. Lens models that only include the four visible galaxies are unable to reproduce the properties of HerS-3. By adding a fifth massive component, lying south-east of the brightest galaxy of the group, the source reconstruction is able to match the peak emission, shape and orientation for each of the five images. The fact that no galaxy is detected near that position indicates the presence of a massive dark matter halo in the lensing galaxy group. In the source plane, HerS-3 appears as an infrared luminous starburst galaxy seen nearly edge-on. The serendipitous discovery of this exceptional Einstein cross offers a potential laboratory for exploring at small spatial scales a nuclear starburst at the peak of cosmic evolution and studying the properties of a massive dark matter halo associated with the lensing galaxy group.

2025-09-18, **Dark Photon Oscillations in Waveguide**, Yu-Xin Tian et.al., [2509.14962v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14962v1)

 Dark photons, which can kinetically mix with ordinary photons, represent the simplest extension to the standard model. Detecting their oscillations with visible photons could provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model. We propose a novel laboratory-based approach to detect dark photon oscillations using a laser in an Optical Time-domain Relectometry (OTDR) setup. The laser light propagating through the optical fiber undergoes oscillations with the dark photon, leading to measurable changes in the power flow. These oscillations can precisely measured,   leveraging its high sensitivity and efficiency in detecting small variations in the optical signal. This approach could provide a new avenue for probing dark photon oscillations in the laboratory and greatly improve the current experimental sensitivity to dark photon in a wide mass range.

2025-09-18, **Exploring dark matter with quantum-enhanced haloscopes and time projection chambers**, David Díez-Ibáñez et.al., [2509.14897v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14897v1)

 This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy. It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies.   The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors.   Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.

2025-09-18, **Fine-grained dark matter substructure and axion haloscopes**, Ciaran A. J. O'Hare et.al., [2509.14874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14874v1)

 The velocity distribution of cold dark matter within galaxies is expected to exhibit ultra-fine-grained substructure as a result of the many foldings of an initially smooth phase-space sheet under gravity. The innumerable folds of this sheet in the inner regions of a galactic halo would appear on solar-system scales like an extremely large number of spatially overlapping streams of dark matter particles. Some of these streams may also receive amplified densities if dark matter undergoes enhanced clustering in the early Universe, as is the case for axions in the post-inflationary scenario. This ultra-fine-grained dark matter substructure is usually considered irrelevant and undetectable for most direct detection experiments, but for axion haloscopes, this may not be the case. We develop and explore several plausible models for the degree of fine-grained axion dark matter substructure so as to evaluate its impact on the detectability of axions. We find that not only is this substructure detectable in haloscope experiments, but that it may enhance the detectability of the axion if data is analysed with a high-enough frequency resolution. This conclusion motivates ongoing high-resolution analyses of axion data by haloscope collaborations, which have the potential to reveal evidence of the QCD axion even if their nominal experimental sensitivity does not reach the required level under the Standard Halo Model assumption.

2025-09-18, **Monojet and direct detection constraints on real scalar dark matter: EFT and a simple UV completion**, Arnab Roy et.al., [2509.14869v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14869v1)

 We consider constraints that can be placed on certain invisible scalar particles through monojet studies at the LHC and compare them with those from direct detection experiments when interpreted as dark matter. Whereas direct detection constraints are typically more restrictive, we identify regions of parameter space where monojet studies provide important complementary bounds. We carry out our analysis using both a $\phi$SMEFT for real scalar particle pairs coupled to standard-model fields through operators of up to dimension six, and a simple UV completion with vector-like quarks, with both the scalars and the vector-like quarks being odd under a $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ symmetry, while the SM particles are even. The vector-like quarks can only decay into a jet and an invisible scalar, and we recast the current ATLAS monojet data to constrain their parameter space. Comparison of the two descriptions yields some insight into interpreting dark matter constraints obtained with EFTs.

 We present a scalar-field formulation of the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) and modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) models, in which the cosmic fluid dynamics are reproduced by canonical Lagrangians with analytically derived energy density $\rho(\phi)$, pressure $p(\phi)$, and scalar potential $V(\phi)$. This framework provides a unified description of dark matter and dark energy, transitioning naturally from a matter-dominated phase at early times to a negative-pressure dark-energy phase at late times. In this scalar-field formulation, the GCG and MCG models are naturally applicable to both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. Extending this approach, we develop a systematic method to obtain a class of integrable scalar-field cosmological models. In this study, we use this method to construct a new scalar-field altered Chaplygin gas (ACG) model. To investigate the viability of Chaplygin-type models, we perform a likelihood analysis using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation together with Cepheid-calibrated distances. We examine four models, $\Lambda$CDM, GCG, MCG, and ACG, obtaining posterior constraints on the Hubble constant $H\_0$, the present-day effective equation of state $\omega\_0$, the transition redshift $z^\star$, and the cosmic age $t\_0$. With the Cepheid calibration fixing the absolute distance scale, the inferred $H\_{0}$ remains nearly model-independent. The Chaplygin-type models predict an earlier onset of cosmic acceleration than $\Lambda$CDM and give a broader range for the inferred age of the Universe, reflecting their greater flexibility in late-time expansion histories. Among them, the ACG model provides tighter parameter constraints, while the GCG and MCG models produce broader posteriors due to parameter degeneracies.

2025-09-18, **The first stars**, Simon C. O. Glover et.al., [2509.14799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14799v1)

 Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.

 Isocurvature perturbations expected from multi-field inflation models can leave unique signatures in the early Universe, but remain weakly constrained, especially on small scales. In this work, we investigate the constraining power of one-point statistics (variance and skewness) of the 21cm brightness temperature during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, using semi-numerical simulations from 21cmFAST. We model both adiabatic and cold dark matter isocurvature modes, exploring their impact on the matter power spectrum, the timing of structure formation, and the evolution of neutral hydrogen. By varying astrophysical parameters as well as isocurvature fraction and spectral index, we quantify their respective effects on the 21cm power spectrum and on one-point statistics. Our results show that while variance is highly sensitive to the timing of cosmic events and provides tight constraints on isocurvature parameters, skewness is more strongly affected by astrophysical uncertainties and observational noise. Incorporating realistic instrumental noise based on SKA configurations, we perform a Fisher analysis and demonstrate that 21cm variance measurements can constrain the isocurvature fraction down to the sub-percent level, though a strong degeneracy with the spectral index remains. We discuss the importance of complementary probes, such as the 21cm forest and galaxy surveys, to break these parameter degeneracies. Our findings highlight the power of 21cm one-point statistics as robust and independent tools for probing early-Universe physics beyond what is accessible with traditional power spectrum analyses.

2025-09-18, **Signature of axion dark matter in low-frequency terrestrial electromagnetic fields: formulation and predictions**, Atsushi Taruya et.al., [2509.14673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14673v1)

 We develop a theoretical framework for axion dark matter (DM) searches using terrestrial electromagnetic (EM) fields. Axions couple to the geomagnetic field and generate a monochromatic EM signal at a frequency set by the axion mass. Incorporating a realistic atmospheric conductivity, we describe the axion-induced EM waves confined in the Earth-ionosphere cavity, avoiding the divergences present in idealized treatments. Our semi-analytical method yields quantitative predictions for the axion-induced magnetic field near the Earth's surface, and we found that (i) at $m\_{\rm a} \gtrsim 10^{-14}$ eV, the signal exhibits resonance structures aligned with Schumann resonances, and the magnetic field amplitude is especially enhanced at $m\_{\rm a} \sim 3 \times 10^{-14}$ eV. (ii) The signal amplitude and orientation also vary with geographic location, with Southeast Asia offering the strongest sensitivity. These predictions are insensitive to uncertainties in conductivity models and boundary conditions. Those distinctive features provide a reliable template to distinguish axion-induced signals from natural or anthropogenic EM backgrounds, and the formalism can be extended to other DM candidates such as dark photons.

 The dark matter scattering with atomic bound electrons is a crucial avenue for exploring the sub-GeV mass range. If not handled properly, even negative values can arise in the scattering matrix element squared or equivalently the differential cross section in extreme cases. Starting from quantum field theory, we establish a theoretically consistent formalism to account for the atomic effects. Especially, we investigate the difference between the non-relativistic and relativistic calculations to show that the relativistic effects can lead to a $30\% \sim 50\%$ reduction in the atomic factor. In other words, not just a theoretically consistent formalism for the atomic effects but also relativistic calculation with Dirac equation are necessary.

2025-09-17, **Lepton Collider as a Window to Reheating via Freezing Out Dark Matter Detection**, Subhaditya Bhattacharya et.al., [2509.14340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14340v1)

 We investigate a particle dark matter (DM) scenario where the DM interaction with the Standard Model are mediated by a leptophilic effective operator. Unlike conventional WIMP scenarios where thermal freeze-out occurs in a radiation-dominated Universe, we consider DM freeze-out during a prolonged reheating epoch driven by inflaton decay. The resulting departure from standard cosmology alters the thermal evolution of the dark matter abundance, making it sensitive to the reheating temperature and the history of entropy injection. The leptophilic nature of the interaction, motivated by the absence of DM signals in the current LHC searches, suppresses couplings to quarks and gluons and instead enables viable DM-lepton interactions that remain largely unconstrained. Within this setup, we analyze the mono-Higgs plus missing energy channel at future lepton colliders where the same operator responsible for setting the relic abundance can be directly probed. We perform a detailed signal-background analysis using both polarized and unpolarized beams. Additionally, our results illustrate how collider experiments, when interpreted jointly with relic density constraints, can provide indirect hints of the Universe's thermal history, offering potential insights into the reheating temperature and the dynamics preceding Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.

2025-09-17, **High-Quality Axion Dark Matter at Gravitational Wave Interferometers**, Disha Bandyopadhyay et.al., [2509.14323v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14323v1)

 Gravitational effects are known to violate global symmetries, threatening the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) solution to the strong CP problem. Ultraviolet completions featuring a gauged $U(1)$ symmetry, where $U(1)\_{\rm PQ}$ arises as an accidental global symmetry, can suppress Planck-suppressed operators, enabling high-quality axions in a mass window where it can also account for the observed dark matter (DM) in the Universe. We show that in such models, the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry generates a strong stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from gauge cosmic string loops. For breaking scales $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the SGWB signal strength exceeds astrophysical foregrounds across a broad frequency range. Contrary to conventional gauge cosmic string scenarios, such quality axion models have a characteristic IR break frequency originating from the collapse of string-wall network around axion oscillation temperature. We propose this characteristic SGWB frequency-amplitude region, identified as \textit{Signature-Window-Axion-Gravitational waves} (SWAG), to be a novel probe of high-quality axion DM at future space and ground-based interferometers.

 We propose the Semiconductor-Quantum-Well Axion Radiometer Experiment ($\texttt{SQWARE}$) -- a new experimental platform for direct detection of axion dark matter in the meV mass range -- based on resonantly enhanced axion-photon conversion through the inverse Primakoff effect in engineered quantum semiconductor heterostructures. The core of the radiometer is a GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well structure forming a magnetoplasmonic cavity, containing an ultrahigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, which realizes a tunable epsilon-near-zero resonance in the terahertz frequency range. By controlling the orientation of the cavity within a strong external magnetic field, both the resonance frequency and the axion-induced current are optimized $\textit{in situ}$, enabling efficient scanning across a broad mass range without complex mechanical adjustment. The axion-induced electromagnetic signal radiatively emitted from the magnetoplasmonic cavity is detected by a state-of-the-art photodetector. We present the theoretical basis for resonant enhancement, detail the experimental design and benchmarks through extensive simulations, and project the sensitivity of $\texttt{SQWARE}$ for several realistic configurations. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SQWARE}$ can probe the well-motivated quantum chromodynamics axion parameter space and close a critical gap in direct searches at meV masses.

2025-09-17, **Stellar velocity distributions in binary-rich ultrafaint dwarf galaxies**, Amery Gration et.al., [2509.14316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14316v1)

 Ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies are dominated by dark matter, the distribution of which may be inferred from the kinematics of that galaxy's stellar population. Star-by-star observations are available for the satellite UFD galaxies of the Milky Way, making them uniquely good laboratories in which to test cosmological predictions at the smallest scales. However, the kinematics of these galaxies are complicated by the presence of binary stars, which alter the stellar velocity distribution. In particular these binary stars increase the galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion, which is related to the total galactic mass by the virial theorem. Without correctly eliminating or accounting for binary stars we may therefore overestimate the masses of UFD galaxies or even confuse globular clusters for UFD galaxies. Here we write down the probability density function for the observed line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of a stellar population containing both visual and spectroscopic binary stars, which we then use to determine the effect of those binary stars on the observed LOS velocity dispersion. For the coldest UFD galaxies the fractional increase in LOS velocity dispersion is of order one and for the coldest globular clusters is of order 100. However, if the stellar initial mass function is bottom light, as it may be for UFD galaxies and globular clusters, then both of these values increase by half a dex.

2025-09-17, **Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): Exploring the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra-I cluster IV. A study of the Globular Cluster population in four UDGs**, Marco Mirabile et.al., [2509.14206v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14206v1)

 As old stellar systems, globular clusters (GCs) are key fossil tracers of galaxy formation and interaction histories. This paper is part of the LEWIS project, an integral-field spectroscopic survey of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Hydra I cluster. We use MUSE spectroscopy and new VIRCAM $H$-band imaging data to study the GC populations and dark matter content in four dwarf galaxies. We retrieved line-of-sight velocities for all sources in the observed MUSE fields. Since the spectroscopic measurements are limited to relatively bright sources, we developed a multi-band photometric procedure to identify additional GC candidates too faint for spectroscopic confirmation. GC candidates were selected using a combination of photometric properties and morphometric criteria. Additionally, the $H$-band observations were used to constrain the stellar masses of the studied galaxies. Based on the spectroscopic classification, we confirm one GC in UDG3, two in UDG7, and four in UDG11, while UDG9 has no spectroscopically confirmed bright GCs. We identify four intra-cluster GCs in the vicinity of UDG3 and UDG11, and one ultra-compact dwarf with a radial velocity only $\Delta v = -85 \pm 10\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ relative to UDG7, suggesting it may be bound to it. Considering completeness corrections and accounting for possible contamination, from photometry we estimate that the number of GCs ranges between 0 and $\sim40$ for the investigated UDGs. Their specific frequencies suggest that three out of four UDGs are either GC-rich, similar to those in the Coma cluster, or belong to an intermediate population as seen in the Perseus cluster. Dark matter content estimates, inferred from GC counts and stellar mass, indicate that these galaxies are dark-matter dominated, with dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios of $M\_{\mathrm{dyn}} / M\_\star \sim 10-1000$.

2025-09-17, **Blackhole perturbations in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas model**, Sunil Singh Bohra et.al., [2509.14064v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14064v1)

 We study blackhole in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas (MGCG) model, a modified gravity framework proposed to unify dark matter and dark energy. The resulting spacetime is asymptotically non-flat and feature two distinct horizons, determined by the Chaplygin parameter {\alpha}. Observational constraints favor negative values of {\alpha}, which restrict the allowed parameter space. Through linear perturbation analysis, we show that this blackhole remain stable under both scalar and electromagnetic perturbation. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectra depend sensitively on the MGCG parameters, indicating that this cosmological model leaves characteristic imprints on blackhole oscillations. These results suggest that gravitational-wave observations of blackhole ringdowns may provide a means of constraining MGCG and testing unified dark sector scenarios in the strong-field regime.

2025-09-17, **Conditioning halos on the tidal environment for fast and accurate HI power spectra during reionization**, Gaurav Pundir et.al., [2509.13690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13690v1)

 Predicting the statistical properties of the neutral hydrogen (HI) density field during reionization is an important step in using upcoming 21 cm observations to constrain models of reionization. Semi-numerical models of reionization are often coupled with the collapse fraction field $f\_{\text{coll}}(\mathbf{x})$, which determines the fraction of dark matter within halos. In this work, we improve upon earlier prescriptions that compute $f\_{\text{coll}}$ based on the dark matter overdensity $\delta(\mathbf{x})$ alone, to include more information about the environment in the form of eigenvalues of the tidal tensor. We compute the mean of the $f\_{\text{coll}}$ conditioned on these eigenvalues from a set of high-resolution, small-volume simulations and use them to sample the $f\_{\text{coll}}$ field of a low-resolution, large-volume simulation. We subsequently use a semi-numerical code for reionization to compute the HI density field and its power spectrum, and benchmark our results against a reference high-resolution, large-volume simulation. Across variations in redshift, ionized fraction, grid resolution, and minimum halo mass, our method recovers the large-scale HI power spectrum with errors at the $\lesssim 2\%-5\%$ level for $k \lesssim 0.5~ h~ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, providing a substantial improvement over the $\sim 10\%$ results previously obtained using density-only conditioning. Overall, this makes our method a simple yet efficient tool for forward modeling HI maps during reionization.

 Probing the dynamics of superconductor phase transitions induced by strong electromagnetic fields is vital to designing high power devices leveraging these materials. The development of high temperature superconductors (HTS) is particularly interesting due to critical temperatures ($T\_c$) approaching 90 K, the ability to support high current densities, and their ability to operate in strong static magnetic fields. This work aims to determine the transition dynamics of these materials at radio-frequencies (rf) in the microwave range where they have enormous potential for new applications ranging from particle accelerators to dark matter searches. We have tested two types of coatings formed from rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO): a film deposited by electron-beam physical vapor deposition, and HTS conductor tapes soldered to a copper substrate with exposed REBCO surfaces. Testing was performed via a hemispherical transverse-electric mode cavity that maximizes the surface rf magnetic field and minimizes the surface electric field on a 2-inch diameter sample. We report on steady-state measurements at low rf power, as well as fully time-resolved transition dynamics on the microsecond timescale seen for the first time with strong surface rf fields.

 The polarized light of the cosmic microwave background is sensitive to new physics that violates parity symmetry. For example, the interaction of photons with the fields of elusive dark matter and dark energy could cause a uniform rotation of the plane of linear polarization across the sky, an effect known as cosmic birefringence. We extract the cosmological rotation angle, $\beta$, using Bayesian analysis of parity-violating correlations, $EB$ and $TB$, of polarization data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6. We use prior probabilities for instrumental miscalibration angles derived from the optics model for the ACT telescope and instruments, and marginalize over a residual intensity-to-polarization leakage. We measure $\beta = 0.215^\circ\pm 0.074^\circ$ (68\% confidence level), which excludes $\beta=0$ with a statistical significance of $2.9\sigma$. Although there remain systematics in the ACT data that are not understood and do not allow us to draw strong cosmological conclusions, this result is consistent with previous independent results from the \wmap\ and \planck\ missions. It is suggestive that independent data sets and analyses using different methodologies have yielded the same sign and comparable magnitudes for $\beta$.

 In recent years, the number of known sources emitting very- and ultra-high-energy gamma-rays has increased significantly thanks to facilities such as LHAASO and HAWC. Many of the observed sources are still unidentified or poorly constrained due to the limited angular resolution of these instruments; however, it is now ascertained that approximately half of them have a pulsar in coincidence. Some of these unidentified extended sources may be the result of the diffusion of leptons accelerated by the pulsar itself or in its nebula to energies exceeding 50 TeV. This new class of sources, called TeV halos, is characterized by a peculiar radial profile that, if properly resolved, is key to distinguishing them from other TeV sources that are associated with a pulsar, such as supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae. In this contribution, we consider all the pulsars which are spatially coincident with an unidentified extended TeV source, in order to quantify whether its spin-down power, age and distance allow the pulsar to produce a TeV halo with the observed flux and extension. We also investigate how the next generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), namely the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and the ASTRI Mini-Array, will observe and characterize these TeV halos. We present a set of simulated sources with the expected morphology and spectrum, and we show for which of them we can distinguish between TeV halos and other classes of extended sources.

2025-09-18, **Parameterizing quasi-quintessence and quasi-phantom fields without the nearly flat potential approximation**, Anna Chiara Alfano et.al., [2509.15146v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15146v1)

 An alternative dark energy description based on a generalized K-essence scenario is here explored. In particular, we consider a \emph{quasi-quintessence} and/or \emph{quasi-phantom} field, whose pressure does not depend on the kinetic energy, firstly discussed in the context of the cosmological constant problem. In so doing, we fix the background evolution and investigate the main observational signatures of its corresponding fluid-like representation. The corresponding scalar field can be parameterized independently from the potential form and without imposing the condition $\omega \sim -1$ used for quintessence and phantom fields. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters by performing Monte-Carlo Markov chain simulations through the adoption of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and perform separated analyses, employing different data catalogs. More precisely, as data sets we employ observational Hubble data, type Ia supernovae and the second data release from the DESI Collaboration, namely DESI DR2. We define a hierarchy among analyses and, precisely, in the first we adopt all three samples, while the second excludes the DESI data points, with the aim of facing its effect on corresponding bounds. Our findings suggest that the \emph{quasi-quintessence} scenario prefers Planck's value of the Hubble constant $H\_0$, but suggesting that, when the DESI sample is excluded from our computations, $\omega\_0$ enters the phantom regime, although still compatible at $1$-$\sigma$ confidence level with a cosmological constant. Remarkably, these results appear in tension than those found for a standard quintessence, explored within the context of the recent DESI release, likely indicating that the DESI data may furnish inconclusive results depending on the kind of scalar field involved into the computation.

2025-09-18, **A dark energy model for coasting cosmology**, Yunliang Ren et.al., [2509.15039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15039v1)

 Coasting cosmology offers an intriguing and straightforward framework for understanding the universe. In this work, we employ the Trans-Planckian Censorship Criterion (TCC) conjecture to test the viability of the coasting cosmology and propose an entropic dark energy (EDE) model within this framework. By applying the holographic principle to constrain the dark energy density and adopting the Bekenstein entropy and Tsallis entropy as the constraining entropies of the system, we find that, in a holographic coasting cosmological framework where dark energy and dark matter evolve independently, the Tsallis entropy satisfies certain general assumptions better than the Bekenstein entropy. Thus, there may be a fundamental relationship between Tsallis entropy and dark energy. We utilize observational data from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) to constrain EDE model. The optimal Tsallis parameter obtained aligns well with theoretical expectations. To evaluate the model's fit to the observed data, we calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Kullback Information Criterion (KIC), and compare these metrics with those derived from $\Lambda$CDM, under which the model shows some improvement. Overall, this model provides a novel and simple on the evolution of the universe.

2025-09-18, **No evidence for $H_0$ anisotropy from Tully-Fisher or supernova distances**, Richard Stiskalek et.al., [2509.14997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14997v1)

 Claims of anisotropy in the Hubble constant have been made based on direct distance tracers such as Tully-Fisher galaxies and Type Ia supernovae. We revisit these using the CosmicFlows-4 Tully-Fisher W1 subsample, 2MTF and SFI++ Tully-Fisher catalogues, and the Pantheon+ supernova compilation (restricted to $z < 0.05$), including a dipole in either the Tully-Fisher zero-point or the standardised supernova absolute magnitude. Our forward-modelling framework jointly calibrates the distance relation, marginalises over distances, and accounts for peculiar velocities using a linear-theory reconstruction. We compare the anisotropic and isotropic model using the Bayesian evidence. In the CosmicFlows-4 sample, we infer a zero-point dipole of amplitude $0.087 \pm 0.019$ mag, or $4.1\pm0.9$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. This is consistent with previous estimates but at higher significance: model comparison yields odds of $877\!:\!1$ in favour of including the zero-point dipole. In Pantheon+ we infer zero-point dipole amplitude of $0.049 \pm 0.013$ mag, or $2.3\pm 0.6$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. However, by allowing for a radially varying velocity dipole, we show that the anisotropic model captures local flow features (or possibly systematics) in the data rather than an actual linearly growing effective bulk flow caused by anisotropy in the zero-point or expansion rate. Inferring a more general bulk flow curve we find results fully consistent with expectations from the standard cosmological model.

2025-09-18, **Radial pulsation runaway in massive red supergiants in late evolutionary stage and implications to hydrogen-rich supernovae**, Akihiro Suzuki et.al., [2509.14928v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14928v1)

 Performing a series of hydrodynamic stellar evolutionary simulations with \textsc{Mesa} (Module for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), we investigate the excitation and growth of radial pulsations of massive red supergiants (RSGs) with the initial mass range of $M\_\mathrm{ini}=13$--$18\,\mathrm{M}\_\odot$. We show that strong radial pulsations develop in the hydrogen-rich envelope in their late evolutionary stages, and eventually the surface radial velocity exceeds the escape velocity for higher-mass models. On the other hand, lower-mass models exhibit more moderate pulsations with finite velocity amplitudes and are expected to keep massive hydrogen-rich envelopes when they evolve toward the gravitational collapse of the iron core. While the latter group ends up as a familiar transient population of exploding RSGs, i.e., type IIP supernovae (SNe), the former group may expel a part of their envelopes and explode as different transients population. We investigate how the energy of the oscillating envelope is dissipated and released as radiation. We also empirically determine the condition for the pulsation-driven mass ejection in terms of the luminosity-to-mass ratio, $L/M>10^{3.9}\mathrm{L}\_\odot/\mathrm{M}\_\odot$. The corresponding luminosity threshold for the explored mass range may explain the observationally inferred constraints on type IIP SN progenitors.

2025-09-18, **Studying SNR-MC interactions as galactic PeVatrons in the era of CTAO and ASTRI Mini-Array**, Alan Sunny et.al., [2509.14867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14867v1)

 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely recognized as key accelerators of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), supported by the detection of the characteristic pion bump in the gamma-ray spectra of several SNRs. However, the recent observation of ultra-high-energy (UHE, greater than 100 TeV) gamma-rays by LHAASO from sources such as W51 region challenges standard models, which predict CR acceleration up to PeV energies only during the early (~ 100 year) phase of SNR evolution. Given the older age of known SNRs, alternative mechanisms - such as the interaction of runaway CRs with nearby molecular clouds (MCs) - have been proposed to explain the persistent UHE emission. In this study, we focus on the W51 complex, particularly the W51C-B region, as a promising site for investigating SNR-MC interactions. Simulated observations with the CTAO and the ASTRI Mini-Array are presented to demonstrate their crucial role in bridging the energy gap between Fermi-LAT and LHAASO, especially in the 0.3-100 TeV range. Their improved angular resolution will also help disentangle emission components from the interaction zone and nearby sources. Our theoretical modelling suggests that accelerated particles at the shock can account for the radio and GeV data, while UHE emission could be best explained by the combined contribution from both acceleration and adiabatic compression of cloud material at the SNR-MC interface.

2025-09-18, **The Altered Chaplygin Model as a Model for Dark Energy**, Yi-Syuan et.al., [2509.14826v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14826v1)

 We present a scalar-field formulation of the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) and modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) models, in which the cosmic fluid dynamics are reproduced by canonical Lagrangians with analytically derived energy density $\rho(\phi)$, pressure $p(\phi)$, and scalar potential $V(\phi)$. This framework provides a unified description of dark matter and dark energy, transitioning naturally from a matter-dominated phase at early times to a negative-pressure dark-energy phase at late times. In this scalar-field formulation, the GCG and MCG models are naturally applicable to both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. Extending this approach, we develop a systematic method to obtain a class of integrable scalar-field cosmological models. In this study, we use this method to construct a new scalar-field altered Chaplygin gas (ACG) model. To investigate the viability of Chaplygin-type models, we perform a likelihood analysis using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation together with Cepheid-calibrated distances. We examine four models, $\Lambda$CDM, GCG, MCG, and ACG, obtaining posterior constraints on the Hubble constant $H\_0$, the present-day effective equation of state $\omega\_0$, the transition redshift $z^\star$, and the cosmic age $t\_0$. With the Cepheid calibration fixing the absolute distance scale, the inferred $H\_{0}$ remains nearly model-independent. The Chaplygin-type models predict an earlier onset of cosmic acceleration than $\Lambda$CDM and give a broader range for the inferred age of the Universe, reflecting their greater flexibility in late-time expansion histories. Among them, the ACG model provides tighter parameter constraints, while the GCG and MCG models produce broader posteriors due to parameter degeneracies.

2025-09-18, **The first stars**, Simon C. O. Glover et.al., [2509.14799v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14799v1)

 Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.

 Stars exhibit a range of variability periods that depend on their mass, age, and evolutionary stage. For space-based photometric data, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated success in recovering and measuring periodic variability from photometric missions like Kepler and TESS. All-sky ground-based surveys can have similar if not longer baselines than space-based missions, however these datasets are more challenging to work with due to irregular sampling, more complex systematics, and larger data gaps. In this work, we demonstrate that CNNs can be used to derive variability periods from ground-based surveys. From the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) we recover 208,260 variability periods between 1-30 days, approximately 60% of which are new detections. We recover periods for active RSCVn, anomalous sub-subgiants, and cool dwarfs that are consistent with previously measured rotation periods, while periods for stars above the Kraft break are generally spurious. We also identify periodic signals in tens of thousands of giants stars which correspond to frequencies of stellar oscillations rather than rotation. Our results highlight that CNNs can be used on sparsely sampled ground-based photometry and may prove useful for upcoming observations from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

 Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.

2025-09-17, **The cosmic journey of dust grains - from nucleation to planetary system**, Kira Lund et.al., [2509.14325v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14325v1)

 Dust is essential to the evolution of galaxies and drives the formation of planetary systems. The challenge of inferring the origin of different presolar dust grains from meteoritic samples motivates forward modelling to understand the contributions of low- and high-mass stars to dust in our Solar System. In this work we follow the evolution of dust with tracer particles within a hydrodynamical simulation of a Milky Way-like isolated disc galaxy. We find that nearly half of the grains released from stars lose less than $10\%$ of their initial mass due to thermal sputtering in the interstellar medium (ISM), with an average degree of atomisation $\sim$$10\%$ higher for dust grains released by supernovae relative to asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star grains. We show through supernova remnant model variations that supernova (SN) dust survival is primarily shaped by the supernova bubble environment in the first million years (Myr) after the explosion rather than by its evolution during $10^2-10^3$ Myr in the ISM. The AGB/SN ratio of dust grains incorporated into newly formed stars approaches $0.8$ after a few hundred Myr of galactic evolution. Our analysis also shows that star-forming particles with short ($<$$10$ Myr) free-floating time-scales in the ISM are predominantly released from supernovae rather than AGB stars. This implies that the Solar System budget of short-lived radioactive isotopes such as $^{26}$Al, whose decay contributed to melting and differentiating planetesimals, should have been provided by massive stars with masses $M \gtrsim 8$ M$\_{\odot}$.

2025-09-17, **Systematic Search for Electromagnetic Counterparts to the Binary Neutron Star Merger Candidate GW231109_235456**, Zhirui Li et.al., [2509.14124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14124v1)

 In this letter, we present a systematic search for the electromagnetic counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) merger candidate GW231109\_235456 by examining all transients reported within the 90% probability region and detected within four days of the merger. While non-detection in $\gamma$-ray, we identify two optical candidates, each associated with and residing in a host galaxy, which locate within 330 Mpc from earth; notably, one of them, AT2023xqy, is located at a distance of $178.6$ Mpc, in good agreement with the estimated distance of the GW candidate ($\sim165^{+70}\_{-69}~\mathrm{Mpc}$). Near the trigger time of GW231109\_235456 (MJD 60257.996), AT2023xqy showed evidence of a $\sim$15-day rise, first detected at $3\sigma$ significance on MJD 60259.097 and confirmed above $5\sigma$ on MJD 60262.088. This was followed by a rapid $\sim$5-day decline and a plateau lasting at least 50 days, with the subsequent decay unobserved due to a data gap. The spatiotemporal coincidences indicate that AT2023xqy could be a candidate for the EM counterpart of BNS merger candidate GW231109\_235456, though its lightcurve is difficult to reconcile with a standard kilonova. We examine two possible scenarios to explain the origin of AT2023xqy, a BNS merger-irrelevant scenario involving a peculiar supernova or a BNS merger-relevant scenario involving a magnetar-powered kilonova under extreme conditions. Follow-up radio observations are strongly encouraged, as they may provide critical insights into the nature of AT2023xqy.

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread in the interstellar medium (ISM) of Solar metallicity galaxies, where they play a critical role in ISM heating, cooling, and reprocessing stellar radiation. The PAH fraction, the abundance of PAHs relative to total dust mass, is a key parameter in ISM physics. Using JWST and MUSE observations of 42 galaxies from the PHANGS survey, we analyze the PAH fraction in over 17 000 H II regions spanning a gas-phase oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.0-8.8 (Z ~ 0.2-1.3 Zsun), and ~400 isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). We find a significantly lower PAH fraction toward H II regions compared to a reference sample of diffuse ISM areas at matched metallicity. At 12+log(O/H) > 8.2, the PAH fraction toward H II regions is strongly anti-correlated with the local ionization parameter, suggesting that PAH destruction is correlated with ionized gas and/or hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation. At lower metallicities, the PAH fraction declines steeply in both H II regions and the diffuse ISM, likely reflecting less efficient PAH formation in metal-poor environments. Carefully isolating dust emission from the vicinity of optically-identified supernova remnants, we see evidence for selective PAH destruction from measurements of lower PAH fractions, which is, however, indistinguishable at ~50 pc scales. Overall, our results point to ionizing radiation as the dominant agent of PAH destruction within H II regions, with metallicity playing a key role in their global abundance in galaxies.

2025-09-17, **Fermi-LAT Detected Gamma-ray Emission Likely Associated with SNR Kes 78**, Yun-Zhi Shen et.al., [2509.13812v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13812v1)

 We have analyzed the GeV gamma-ray emission in the region of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 78 using $\sim$16.7 years of Fermi-LAT observations and found that the catalog sources 4FGL J1852.4+0037e and 4FGL J1851.8$-$0007c are better represented as two extended sources modeled as `2Ext'. One of them, designated as E2, is located at R.A.$=282.86^\circ$, Dec.$=-0.11^\circ$ with the 68\% containment radius $R\_{68} = 0.31^\circ$, and is detected with a significance of 15.2$\sigma$ in the 0.2--500 GeV energy range. The gamma-ray emission of source E2 is well described by a log-parabola (LogP) spectral model with spectral index $\Gamma$ = 1.2 and curvature $\beta$ = 0.3. The fitting with electron-proton number ratio $K\_{\rm ep}=0.01$ indicates that the GeV emission of source E2 is dominated by hadronic emission. Given the dense molecular environment surrounding the middle-aged SNR Kes 78, the hadronic scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed GeV emission. The extended source E2 can also be replaced with two point sources. One of them, designated as PTS1, is coincident with the newly discovered PSR J1852$-$0002g within the 68\% positional uncertainty circle, indicating a possible gamma-ray contribution from this PSR. The gamma-ray spectrum of source PTS1 can be well described by a LogP spectral shape. The synchro-curvature radiation model provides a satisfactory spectral fit for source PTS1, suggesting that some of the GeV emission from the Kes 78 region might possibly originate from the magnetosphere of PSR J1852$-$0002g.
