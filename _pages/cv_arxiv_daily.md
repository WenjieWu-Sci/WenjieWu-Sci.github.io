2024-03-14, **High-energy Neutrinos from Outflows Powered by Kicked Remnants of Binary Black Hole Mergers in AGN Accretion Disks**, Zhi-Peng Ma et.al., [2403.09387v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09387v1)

 Merging of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) could take place within the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The resulting BH remnant is likely to accrete the disk gas at a super-Eddington rate, launching a fast, quasi-spherical outflow (wind). Particles will be accelerated by shocks driven by the wind, subsequently interacting with the shocked disk gas or radiation field through hadronic processes and resulting in the production of high-energy neutrinos and potential electromagnetic (EM) emissions. This study delves into the intricate evolution of the shock driven by the remnant BH wind within AGN disks. Subsequently, we calculated the production of neutrinos and the expected detection numbers for a single event, along with their contributions to the overall diffuse neutrino background. Our analysis, considering various scenarios, reveals considerable neutrino production and possible detection by IceCube for nearby events. The contribution of the remnant BH winds on the diffuse neutrino background is minor due to the low event rate density, but it can be improved to some extent for some optimistic parameters. We also propose that there could be two neutrino/EM bursts, one originating from the premerger BBH wind and the other from the remnant BH wind, with the latter typically having a time gap to the GW event of around tens of days. When combined with the anticipated gravitational waves (GW) emitted during the BBH merger, such a system emerges as a promising candidate for joint observations involving neutrinos, GWs, and EM signals.

2024-03-14, **Effect of torsion in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments**, Papia Panda et.al., [2403.09105v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09105v1)

 In this work we investigate the effect of curved spacetime on neutrino oscillation. In a curved spacetime, the effect of curvature on fermionic fields is represented by spin connection. The spin connection consists of a non-universal ``contorsion" part which is expressed in terms of vector and axial current density of fermions. The contraction of contorsion part with the tetrad fields, which connects the internal flat space metric and the spacetime metric, is called torsion. In a scenario where neutrino travels through background of fermionic matter at ordinary densities in a curved spacetime, the Hamiltonian of neutrino oscillation gets modified by the torsional coupling constants $\lambda\_{21}^{\prime}$ and $\lambda\_{31}^{\prime}$. The aim of this work is to study the effect of $\lambda\_{21}^{\prime}$ and $\lambda\_{31}^{\prime}$ in DUNE and P2SO. In our study we, (i) discuss the effect of torsional coupling constants on the neutrino oscillation probabilities, (ii) estimate the capability of P2SO and DUNE to put bounds on these parameters and (iii) study how the physics sensitivities get modified in presence of torsion.

2024-03-13, **Collapsar disk outflows I: Viscous hydrodynamic evolution in axisymmetry**, Coleman Dean et.al., [2403.08877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08877v1)

 We investigate mass ejection from accretion disks formed during the collapse of rapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet stars. The neutrino-cooled, black hole (BH) accretion disk system that forms at the center of the star -- and the ensuing outflows -- provide the conditions for these systems to be candidate $r$-process element production sites and potential progenitors of broad-lined Type Ic (Ic-BL) supernovae. Here we present global, long-term axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of collapsar disks that include angular momentum transport through shear viscosity, neutrino emission and absorption, a 19-isotope nuclear reaction network and nuclear statistical equilibrium solver, a pseudo-Newtonian BH with mass and spin modified by accreted matter, and self-gravity. Starting from a stellar profile collapsed in spherical symmetry, our models capture disk formation self-consistently, and are evolved until after the shock wave -- driven by disk winds -- reaches the surface of the star. None of our models achieve sufficient neutronization to eject significant amounts of $r$-process elements (detailed nucleosynthesis calculations will follow in a companion paper). Sufficient $^{56}$Ni is produced to power a typical type Ic-BL supernova light curve, but the average asymptotic velocity is a factor $\sim 2-3$ times too slow to account for the typical line widths in type Ic-BL supernova spectra. The gap in neutrino emission between BH formation and shocked disk formation, and the magnitude of the subsequent peak in emission, would be observable diagnostics of the internal conditions of the progenitor in a galactic collapsar. Periodic oscillations of the shocked disk prior to its expansion are also a potential observable through their impact on the the neutrino and gravitational wave signals.

2024-03-13, **Axi-majoron for almost everything**, Gabriela Barenboim et.al., [2403.08675v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08675v1)

 The details of the minimal cosmological standard model (MCSM) proposed in Ref. [1] are discussed. The model is based on the scale-symmetry and the global Peccei-Quinn(PQ) symmetry with a key assumption that the latter is broken only in the gravity sector in a scale-invariant manner. We show that the model provides a quite simple unified framework for the unknown history of the universe from inflation to the epoch of big-bang nucleosynthesis, simultaneously addressing key puzzles of high energy theory and cosmology: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Scale symmetry can be exact, and the Planck scale is dynamically generated. The presence of Gauss-Bonnet term may safely retain dangerous non-perturbative symmetry-breaking effects negligible, allowing large-field trans-Planckian inflation along the PQ-field. Iso-curvature perturbations of axi-majorons are suppressed. A sizable amount of PQ-number asymmetry is generated at the end of inflation, and conserved afterwards. Domain wall problem is absent due to the PQ-number asymmetry. Baryogenesis can be realized by either inflationary Affleck-Dine mechanism or spontaneous leptogenesis thanks to the PQ-number asymmetry, or by resonant leptogenesis. Dark matter can be purely cold axi-majorons from the mis-alignment contribution only with the symmetry-breaking scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{12}) {\rm GeV}$. Hot axi-majorons from the decay of the inflaton become a natural source for a sizable amount of dark radiation. Inflationary gravitational waves are expected to have information about some masse parameters of the left-handed and the right-handed neutrinos, thanks to the presence of an early matter-domination era driven by at least a long-lived right-handed neutrino species.

2024-03-13, **Measurements of the charge ratio and polarization of cosmic-ray muons with the Super-Kamiokande detector**, H. Kitagawa et.al., [2403.08619v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08619v1)

 We present the results of the charge ratio ($R$) and polarization ($P^{\mu}\_{0}$) measurements using the decay electron events collected from 2008 September to 2022 June by the Super-Kamiokande detector. Because of its underground location and long operation, we performed high precision measurements by accumulating cosmic-ray muons. We measured the muon charge ratio to be $R=1.32 \pm 0.02$ $(\mathrm{stat.}{+}\mathrm{syst.})$ at $E\_{\mu}\cos \theta\_{\mathrm{Zenith}}=0.7^{+0.3}\_{-0.2}$ $\mathrm{TeV}$, where $E\_{\mu}$ is the muon energy and $\theta\_{\mathrm{Zenith}}$ is the zenith angle of incoming cosmic-ray muons. This result is consistent with the Honda flux model while this suggests a tension with the $\pi K$ model of $1.9\sigma$. We also measured the muon polarization at the production location to be $P^{\mu}\_{0}=0.52 \pm 0.02$ $(\mathrm{stat.}{+}\mathrm{syst.})$ at the muon momentum of $0.9^{+0.6}\_{-0.1}$ $\mathrm{TeV}/c$ at the surface of the mountain; this also suggests a tension with the Honda flux model of $1.5\sigma$. This is the most precise measurement ever to experimentally determine the cosmic-ray muon polarization near $1~\mathrm{TeV}/c$. These measurement results are useful to improve the atmospheric neutrino simulations.

2024-03-13, **Comparing jet-shaped point symmetry in cluster cooling flows and supernovae**, Noam Soker et.al., [2403.08544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08544v1)

 I point out similarities between point-symmetric X-ray morphologies in cooling flow groups and clusters of galaxies, which are observed to be shaped by jets, and point-symmetric morphologies of eight core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants. I use these similarities to strengthen the jittering jet explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, which predicts that the last pairs of jets to be launched by the newly born neutron star might shape some CCSN remnants to point-symmetric morphology. The point-symmetric morphologies in both types of objects are composed of two or more pairs of opposite bubbles (cavities), nozzles, some clumps, small protrusions (termed ears), and rims. The typically large volume of a CCSN remnant shaped by jets implies that the shaping jets carry an energy comparable to that of the ejecta, which in turn implies that jets exploded the remnant's massive star progenitor. The morphological similarities studied here add to the similarity of CCSN remnants, not only point-symmetric ones, to planetary nebulae shaped by jets. Together, these similarities solidify the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe. I consider the identification of point-symmetry in CCSNe, as expected by jet-shaping in the JJEM, to be the most severe challenge to the competing neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. I reiterate my earlier claim, but in a more vocal voice, that the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe is the JJEM.

2024-03-14, **Tidal evolution of cored and cuspy dark matter halos**, Xiaolong Du et.al., [2403.09597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09597v1)

 The internal structure and abundance of dark matter halos and subhalos are powerful probes of the nature of dark matter. In order to compare observations with dark matter models, accurate theoretical predictions of these quantities are needed. We present a fast and accurate method to describe the tidal evolution of subhalos within their parent halo, based on a semi-analytic approach. We first consider idealized N-body simulations of subhalos within their host halo, using a generalized mass density profile that describes their properties in a variety of dark matter models at infall, including popular warm, cold, and self-interacting ones. Using these simulations we construct tidal "tracks" for the evolution of subhalos based on their conditions at infall. Second, we use the results of these simulations to build semi-analytic models (SAMs) for tidal effects, including stripping and heating and implement them within the code GALACTICUS. Our SAMs can accurately predict the tidal evolution of both cored and cuspy subhalos, including the bound mass and density profiles, providing a powerful and efficient tool for studying the post-infall properties of subhalos in different dark matter models.

2024-03-14, **Testing MOND on small bodies in the remote solar system**, David Vokrouhlický et.al., [2403.09555v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09555v1)

 Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), which postulates a breakdown of Newton's laws of gravity/dynamics below some critical acceleration threshold, can explain many otherwise puzzling observational phenomena on galactic scales. MOND competes with the hypothesis of dark matter, which successfully explains the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure. Here we provide the first solar-system test of MOND that probes the sub-critical acceleration regime. Using the Bekenstein-Milgrom AQUAL formulation, we simulate the evolution of myriads of test particles (planetesimals or comets) born in the trans-Neptunian region and scattered by the giant planets over the lifetime of the Sun to heliocentric distances of $10^2$-$10^5$ au. We include the effects of the Galactic tidal field and passing stars. While Newtonian simulations reproduce the distribution of binding energies of long-period and Oort-cloud comets detectable from Earth, MOND-based simulations do not. This conclusion is robust to plausible changes in the migration history of the planets, the migration history of the Sun, the MOND transition function, effects of the Sun's birth cluster, and the fading properties of long-period comets. For the most popular version of AQUAL, characterized by a gradual transition between the Newtonian and MOND regimes, our MOND-based simulations also fail to reproduce the orbital distribution of trans-Neptunian objects in the detached disk (perihelion > 38 au). Our results do not rule out some MOND theories more elaborate than AQUAL, in which non-Newtonian effects are screened on small spatial scales, at small masses, or in external gravitational fields comparable in strength to the critical acceleration.

2024-03-14, **Sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter from cosmic-ray scattering with very-high-energy gamma-ray observatories**, Igor Reis et.al., [2403.09343v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09343v1)

 Huge efforts have been deployed to detect dark matter (DM) in the GeV-TeV mass range involving various detection techniques, and led to strong constraints in the available parameter space. We compute here the sensitivity to sub-GeV DM that can be probed from the inevitable cosmic-ray scattering onto DM particles populating the Milky Way halo. Inelastic scattering of energetic cosmic rays off DM would produce high-energy gamma rays in the final state, providing a new avenue to probe the poorly-constrained so far sub-GeV dark matter mass range. In this work we derive sensitivity forecasts for the inelastic cosmic-ray proton - DM cross section for current and future very-high-energy gamma-ray observatories such as H.E.S.S., LHAASO, CTA and SWGO in the 100 eV to 100 MeV mass range. These inelastic cross section constraints are converted to the elastic proton - DM cross section to highlight further complementarity with cosmological, collider and direct detection searches. The sensitivity computed at 95\% confidence level on the elastic cross section reaches $\sim$2$\times$ 10$^{-32}$ cm$^2$ for a 100 keV DM mass for H.E.S.S.-like and $\sim$7$\times$ 10$^{-34}$ cm$^2$ for a $\sim$1 keV DM mass for LHAASO. The sensitivity prospects for CTA and a strawman SWGO model reach $\sim$6$\times$ 10$^{-34}$ cm$^2$ and $\sim$4$\times$ 10$^{-35}$ cm$^2$, for DM masses of 10 keV and 1 keV, respectively. The sensitivity reach of the gamma-ray observatories considered here enables to probe an uncharted region of the DM mass - cross section parameter space.

2024-03-14, **Exploration at the high-energy frontier: ATLAS Run 2 searches investigating the exotic jungle beyond the Standard Model**, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., [2403.09292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09292v1)

 The Large Hadron Collider is at the high-energy frontier of particle physics, having produced proton$-$proton collisions during Run 2, from 2015 to 2018, at an unprecedented centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The ATLAS experiment has a broad programme to thoroughly explore this uncharted territory, to seek out new exotic particles predicted by theories that boldly go beyond the Standard Model. Although the Standard Model has been very successful, it leaves many questions unanswered, prompting novel ideas about particles that could be hiding in the data, waiting to be discovered by intrepid explorers. These include dark-matter candidates, hidden-sector particles, new vector resonances, leptoquarks, and vector-like quarks, to name a few examples. Searches for new particles are reported here, with the exception of searches for supersymmetry or extended Higgs sectors as these are the subjects of separate reports.

2024-03-14, **TangoSIDM Project: Is the Stellar Mass Tully-Fisher relation consistent with SIDM?**, Camila Correa et.al., [2403.09186v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09186v1)

 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) has the potential to significantly influence galaxy formation in comparison to the cold, collisionless dark matter paradigm (CDM), resulting in observable effects. This study aims to elucidate this influence and to demonstrate that the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation imposes robust constraints on the parameter space of velocity-dependent SIDM models. We present a new set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include the SIDM scheme from the TangoSIDM project and the SWIFT-EAGLE galaxy formation model. Two cosmological simulations suites were generated: one (Reference model) which yields good agreement with the observed $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy mass-size relation, and stellar-to-halo mass relation; and another (WeakStellarFB model) in which the stellar feedback is less efficient, particularly for Milky Way-like systems. Both galaxy formation models were simulated under four dark matter cosmologies: CDM, SIDM with two different velocity-dependent cross sections, and SIDM with a constant cross section. While SIDM does not modify global galaxy properties such as stellar masses and star formation rates, it does make the galaxies more extended. In Milky Way-like galaxies, where baryons dominate the central gravitational potential, SIDM thermalises, causing dark matter to accumulate in the central regions. This accumulation results in density profiles that are steeper than those produced in CDM from adiabatic contraction. The enhanced dark matter density in the central regions of galaxies causes a deviation in the slope of the Tully-Fisher relation, which significantly diverges from the observational data. In contrast, the Tully-Fisher relation derived from CDM models aligns well with observations.

2024-03-14, **Gravitational Wave Probe of Gravitational Dark Matter from Preheating**, Ruopeng Zhang et.al., [2403.09089v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09089v1)

 Following our previous studies on gravitational dark matter (GDM) production in the early Universe of preheating,we forecast high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) spectra as the indirect probe of such GDM. We use proper lattice simulations to handle the resonance,and to solve the GW equation of motion with resonance induced scalar field excitations as the source term.Our numerical results show that the Higgs scalar excitations in the Higgs preheating model give rise to magnitudes of GW energy density spectra of order $10^{-10}$ at frequencies $10-10^{3}$ MHz, whereas the inflaton fluctuation excitations in the inflaton self-resonant preheating model yield magnitudes of GW energy density spectrum up to $10^{-9}~(10^{-11})$ at frequencies near $30~(2)$ MHz for the index $n=4~(6)$.

2024-03-14, **Dynamical Friction and Black Holes in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons**, Russell Boey et.al., [2403.09038v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09038v1)

 We numerically simulate the motion of a black hole as it plunges radially through an ultralight dark matter soliton. We investigate the timescale in which dynamical friction reduces the kinetic energy of the black hole to a minimum, and consider the sensitivity of this timescale to changes in the ULDM particle mass, the total soliton mass, and the mass of the black hole. We contrast our numerical results with a semi-analytic treatment of dynamical friction, and find that the latter is poorly suited to this scenario. In particular, we find that the back-reaction of the soliton to the presence of the black hole is significant, resulting in oscillations in the coefficient of dynamical friction which cannot be described in the simple semi-analytical framework. Furthermore, we observe a late-time reheating effect, in which a significant amount of kinetic energy is transferred back to the black hole after an initial damping phase. This complicates the discussion of ULDM dynamical friction on the scales relevant to the final parsec problem.

2024-03-13, **Constraining Self-interacting Scalar Field Dark Matter From the Black Hole Shadow of the Event Horizon Telescope**, Gabriel Gómez et.al., [2403.08988v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08988v1)

 An exciting possibility to constrain dark matter (DM) scenarios is to search for their gravitational imprints on Black Hole (BH) observations. In this paper, we investigate the impact of self-interacting scalar field DM on the shadow radius of a Schwarzschild BH. We implement a self-consistent formulation, paying attention to the enhancement of the DM density due to the BH gravitational influence and the accretion flow onto the BH. First, we calculate the first-order correction to the shadow radius caused by a general DM environment. Then, we apply this perturbative method to the case of self-interacting scalar field DM and derive analytical expressions for the critical impact parameter. We find that self-consistency requirements, involving the lifetime and the mass of the central DM soliton, or the mass and the size of the extended virialized DM halo, ensure that the impact of the DM environment on the shadow radius is below the observational upper bound. This emphasizes the importance of taking into account the self-consistency constraints of the underlying DM scenario, which can strongly limit the range of possible DM density profiles and their impact on the shadow radius.

2024-03-13, **General Multipoles and Their Implications for Dark Matter Inference**, Jacob S. Cohen et.al., [2403.08895v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08895v1)

 The flux ratios of strongly lensed quasars have previously been used to infer the properties of dark matter. In these analyses it is crucial to separate the effect of the main lensing galaxy and the low-mass dark matter halo population. In this work, we investigate flux-ratio perturbations resulting from general third- and fourth-order multipole perturbations to the main lensing galaxy's mass profile. We simulate four lens systems, each with a different lensing configuration, without multipoles. The simulated flux ratios are perturbed by 10-40 per cent by a population of low-mass haloes consistent with CDM and, in one case, also a satellite galaxy. This level of perturbation is comparable to the magnitude of flux-ratio anomalies in real data that has been previously analyzed. We then attempt to fit the simulated systems using multipoles instead of low-mass haloes. We find that multipoles with amplitudes of 0.01 or less can produce flux-ratio perturbations in excess of 40 per cent. In all cases, third- or fourth-order multipoles can individually reduce the magnitude of, if not eliminate, flux-ratio anomalies. When both multipole orders are jointly included, all simulated flux ratios can be fit to within the observational uncertainty. Our results indicate that low-mass haloes and multipoles are highly degenerate when modelling quadruply-imaged quasars based just on image positions and flux ratios. In the presence of this degeneracy, flux-ratio anomalies in lensed quasars alone cannot be used to place strong constraints on the properties of dark matter without additional information that can inform our priors.

2024-03-13, **Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases**, Yonatan Kahn et.al., [2403.08866v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08866v1)

 The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.

2024-03-13, **Observational tests in scale invariance I: galaxy clusters and rotation of galaxies**, Andre Maeder et.al., [2403.08759v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08759v1)

 Galaxy velocities in clusters, rotation curves of galaxies, and "vertical" oscillations in the Milky Way currently show too high velocities with respect to the masses thought to be involved. While these velocity excesses are currently interpreted as the consequence of dark matter, it can also be naturally explained as a consequence of scale invariant theory, which rests on a very simple first principle: the addition of a new fundamental symmetry. In the present work, the case of scale invariance, present in General Relativity and Maxwell equations for the empty space without charge and current, is considered. Cosmological models predict a rapid decrease of these effects with increasing mean density up to the critical density, where they totally disappear. Starting from the scale invariant geodesic equation by Dirac (1973), for which a demonstration by an action principle is presented, a modified Newton equation is derived. The solutions of this equation are applied to clusters of galaxies, galactic rotation at different redshifts and "vertical" motions in the Milky Way. In this new framework, the convergence of theoretical predictions and observations, in different gravitational systems, epochs, mass range and spatial scales, opens interesting perspectives that deserve to be explored further.

2024-03-13, **Interpreting 95 GeV di-photon/$b\bar{b}$ excesses as a lightest Higgs boson of the MRSSM**, Jan Kalinowski et.al., [2403.08720v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08720v1)

 The Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model (MRSSM) is a well motivated BSM model which can accommodate the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson in agreement with electroweak precision observables, in particular with the $W$ boson mass and $T$ parameter. In the 2016 paper we showed that the SM-like 125 GeV Higgs state can be also realised as the second-to-lightest scalar of the MRSSM, leaving room for another sub-100 GeV state. Motivated by the recent ATLAS and CMS observation of the di-photon excess at a mass of around 95 GeV we investigate the possibility whether this could be the lightest CP-even MRSSM scalar in a variation of our benchmarks presented in the 2016 work. We show that such a state can also simultaneously explain the excess in the $b\bar{b}$ final state observed around the same mass value at LEP. Due to the R-symmetric nature of the model, a light singlet-like Higgs state leads necessarily to a light bino-singlino Dirac dark matter candidate, which can give a correct relic density while evading current experimental bounds. Dark matter and LHC searches place further bounds on this scenario and point to parameter regions which are viable and of interest for the LHC Run III and upcoming dark matter experiments.

2024-03-13, **A too-many dwarf galaxy satellites problem in the M83 group**, Oliver Müller et.al., [2403.08717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08717v1)

 Dwarf galaxies in groups of galaxies provide excellent test cases for models of structure formation. This led to a so-called small-scale crisis, including the famous missing satellite and too-big-to-fail problems. It was suggested that these two problems are solved by the introduction of baryonic physics in cosmological simulations. We test for the nearby grand spiral M83 - a Milky Way sibling - whether its number of dwarf galaxy companions is compatible with today's $\Lambda$ + Cold Dark Matter model using two methods: with cosmological simulations that include baryons, as well as with theoretical predictions from the sub-halo mass function. By employing distance measurements we recover a list of confirmed dwarf galaxies within 330 kpc around M83 down to a magnitude of $M\_V =-10$. We found that both the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Illustris-TNG50 and theoretical predictions agree with the number of confirmed satellites around M83 at the bright end of the luminosity function (>10$^8$ solar masses) but underestimate it at the faint end (down to 10$^6$ solar masses) at more than 3$\sigma$ and 5$\sigma$ levels, respectively. This indicates a too-many satellites problem in $\Lambda$CDM for M83. The actual degree of tension to cosmological models is underestimated, because the number of observed satellites is incomplete due to the high contamination of spurious stars and galactic cirrus.

2024-03-13, **The neutron decay anomaly, neutron stars and dark matter**, Mar Bastero-Gil et.al., [2403.08666v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08666v1)

 The discrepancies in different measurements of the lifetime of isolated neutrons could be resolved by considering an extra neutron decay channel into dark matter, with a branching ratio of the order of $O(1$\%). Although the decay channel into a dark fermion $\chi$ plus visible matter has been already experimentally excluded, a dark decay with either a scalar or dark photon remains still a possibility. In particular, a model with a fermion mass $m\_\chi\approx 1$ GeV and a scalar $m\_\phi \approx O(\rm{MeV})$ could provide not only the required branching ratio to explain the anomaly but also a good dark matter (DM) candidate with the right thermal abundance today. Although the interaction DM-neutron will affect the formation of neutron stars, the combined effect of the dark matter self-interactions mediated by the light scalar and an effective repulsive interaction with the neutrons induced by the scalar-Higgs coupling would allow heavy enough neutron stars. The combined constraints from neutron lifetime, dark matter abundance, neutron star and Higgs physics, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, restrict the light scalar mass to the range $2 m\_e < m\_\phi < 2 m\_e + 0.0375$ MeV.

2024-03-13, **Evolution of cold streams in hot gaseous halos**, WenSheng Hong et.al., [2403.08631v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08631v1)

 In the prevailing model of galaxy formation and evolution, the process of gas accretion onto central galaxies undergoes a transition from cold-dominated to hot-dominated modes. This shift occurs when the mass of the parent dark matter halos exceeds a critical threshold known as $M\_{shock}$. Moreover, cold gas usually flows onto central galaxies through filamentary structures, currently referred to as cold streams. However, the evolution of cold streams in halos with masses around $M\_{shock}$, particularly how they are disrupted, remains unclear. To address this issue, we conduct a set of idealised hydrodynamic simulations. Our simulations show that (1) for a gas metallicity $Z=0.001-0.1Z\_{\odot}$, cold stream with an inflow rate $\sim 3\, \rm{M\_{\odot}}/yr$ per each can persist and effectively transport cold and cool gas to the central region ($< 0.2$ virial radius) in halos with mass $10^{12}\, \rm{M\_{\odot}}$, but is disrupted at a radius around $0.2$ virial radius due to compression heating for halos with mass $3 \times 10^{12}\, \rm{M\_{\odot}}$. (2) At $z\sim 2$, the maximum halo mass that capable of hosting and sustaining cold streams $M\_{stream}$ is between $1\times 10^{12} \rm{M\_{\odot}}$ and $1.5\times 10^{12}\rm{M\_{\odot}}$ for gas metallicity $Z=0.001Z\_{\odot}$, while for a higher gas metallicity $Z=0.1Z\_{\odot}$, this value increases to $\sim 1.5\times 10^{12}\rm{M\_{\odot}}$. (3) The evolution and ultimate fate of cold streams are determined primarily by the rivalry between radiative cooling and compression. Stronger heating due to compression in halos more massive than $M\_{stream}$ can surpass cooling and heat the gas in cold streams to the hot ($\geq 10^6\,$ K) phase.

2024-03-13, **Search for cosmic-ray boosted sub-MeV dark matter-electron scatterings in PandaX-4T**, Xiaofeng Shang et.al., [2403.08361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08361v1)

 We report the first search for the elastic scatterings between cosmic-ray boosted sub-MeV dark matter and electrons in the PandaX-4T liquid xenon experiment. Sub-MeV dark matter particles can be accelerated by scattering with electrons in the cosmic rays and produce detectable electron recoil signals in the detector. Using the commissioning data from PandaX-4T of 0.63~tonne$\cdot$year exposure, we set new constraints on DM-electron scattering cross sections for DM masses ranging from 10~eV/$c^2$ to 3~keV/$c^2$.

 We explore an autonomous system analysis of dark energy models with interactions between dark energy and cold dark matter in a general systematic approach to cosmological fluids. We investigate two types of models such as local and non-local ones. In particular, a local form of interaction is directly proportional to only the energy density, while a non-local interaction is directly proportional to the energy density as well as the Hubble parameter. As a consequence, it is explicitly demonstrated that in both cases there exist the stability points in terms of cosmological parameters. This work aims at obtaining acceleration and stability using interaction models without modifying the matter or geometric component of the Universe.

 Nitrogen is produced by CNO-cycling in massive stars, and can be ejected in significant amounts in supernova explosions. While in H-rich SNe, its [\ion{N}{II}] 6548, 6583 emission becomes obscured by strong H$\alpha$, in explosions of He stars, this nitrogen emission becomes more visible. We here explore the formation of this line, using the \texttt{SUMO} code to compute spectra for a grid of 1D models with parameterized mixing informed from new 2D simulations. Because the mass fraction of nitrogen in the ejecta decreases with larger He core masses, as more of the He/N zone gets processed by shell helium burning and is lost to winds, the [\ion{N}{II}] luminosity relative to the overall optical flux probes the He core mass. By comparing to large samples of data, we find that low-mass He cores ($M\_{\rm preSN}\lesssim\ 3\ M\_\odot$) are exclusively associated with Type IIb SNe, with the exception of Type Ib SN 2007Y. Seeing no strong nitrogen emission in other Type Ib SNe, the implication is either an origin from low-mass stars with the He/N layer (but not the He/C) layer peeled away, or from higher-mass He cores. We also see no clear nitrogen emission in Type Ic SNe. We discuss the diagnostic potential of this new line metric, and also dependencies on mass-loss-rate and metallicity.

2024-03-13, **The thermalization of $γ$-rays in radioactive expanding ejecta: A simple model and its application for Kilonovae and Ia SNe**, Or Guttman et.al., [2403.08769v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08769v1)

 A semi-analytic approximation is derived for the time-dependent fraction $f\_\gamma(t)$ of the energy deposited by radioactive decay $\gamma$-rays in a homologously expanding plasma of general structure. An analytic approximation is given for spherically symmetric plasma distributions. Applied to Kilonovae (KNe) associated with neutron stars mergers and Type Ia supernovae, our semi-analytic and analytic approximations reproduce, with a few percent and 10% accuracy, respectively, the energy deposition rates, $\dot{Q}\_\text{dep}$, obtained in numeric Monte Carlo calculations. The time $t\_\gamma$ beyond which $\gamma$-ray deposition is inefficient is determined by an effective frequency-independent $\gamma$-ray opacity $\kappa\_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$, $t\_\gamma = \sqrt{\kappa\_{\gamma,\text{eff}}\langle\Sigma\rangle t^2}$, where $\langle\Sigma\rangle\propto t^{-2}$ is the average plasma column density. For $\beta$-decay dominated energy release, $\kappa\_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$ is typically close to the effective Compton scattering opacity, $\kappa\_{\gamma,\text{eff}} \approx 0.025~{\rm {cm}^{2}\,g^{-1}}$ with a weak dependence on composition. For KNe, $\kappa\_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$ depends mainly on the initial electron fraction $Y\_e$, $\kappa\_{\gamma,\text{eff}} \approx 0.03(0.05)~{\rm {cm}^{2}\,g^{-1}}$ for $Y\_e \gtrsim (\lesssim) 0.25$ (in contrast with earlier work that found $\kappa\_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$ larger by 1-2 orders of magnitude for low $Y\_e$), and is insensitive to the (large) nuclear physics uncertainties. Determining $t\_\gamma$ from observations will therefore measure the ejecta $\langle\Sigma\rangle t^2$, providing a stringent test of models. For $\langle\Sigma\rangle t^2=2\times10^{11}~{\rm g\,{cm}^{-2}\,s^2}$, a typical value expected for KNe, $t\_\gamma\approx1$ d.

2024-03-13, **Annihilation of positrons from AGN jets as a possible source of cosmic gamma-ray background at energies below 511 keV**, B. A. Nizamov et.al., [2403.08427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08427v1)

 The origin of the diffuse gamma-ray background in the range from hundreds keV to several MeV is not known conclusively. From current models and observations it is believed that, at least partially, this background is formed by blazars and remnants of supernovae (SN) of type Ia in distant galaxies. However, these contributions are not sufficient to reproduce the observed level of the signal. In this work we propose another source which could contribute to this background, namely the jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The composition of jets is not known, but there are observational hints that the fraction of positrons there is substantial. Positrons are partially evacuated to the intergalactic medium and partially mix with the circumgalactic medium and annihilate there comparatively quickly. Using the AGN luminosity function, we estimated the positron production rate and the contribution of the positron annihilation to the cosmic background below 511 keV. We also estimated the analogous contribution from positron annihilation within SN Ia remnants in distant galaxies. The contribution of AGNs is estimated to be a factor of 5 - 10 smaller than the observed background intensity, and the contribution from SNe is yet smaller by one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the contribution of AGNs appeared to be larger than the contribution of blazars estimated from Swift-BAT and Fermi-LAT observations. The main uncertainty in our model is the fraction of positrons remaining in the circumgalactic medium which makes our estimation an upper limit.

 We present SN 2023zaw $-$ a sub-luminous ($\mathrm{M\_r} = -16.7$ mag) and rapidly-evolving supernova ($\mathrm{t\_{1/2,r}} = 4.9$ days), with the lowest nickel mass ($\approx0.002$ $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$) measured among all stripped-envelope supernovae discovered to date. The photospheric spectra are dominated by broad He I and Ca NIR emission lines with velocities of $\sim10\ 000 - 12\ 000$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The late-time spectra show prominent narrow He I emission lines at $\sim$1000$\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, indicative of interaction with He-rich circumstellar material. SN 2023zaw is located in the spiral arm of a star-forming galaxy. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical and analytical modeling of the lightcurve by fitting with a combination of shock-cooling emission and nickel decay. The progenitor has a best-fit envelope mass of $\approx0.2$ $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$ and an envelope radius of $\approx50$ $\mathrm{R\_\odot}$. The extremely low nickel mass and low ejecta mass ($\approx0.5$ $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$) suggest an ultra-stripped SN, which originates from a mass-losing low mass He-star (ZAMS mass $<$ 10 $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$) in a close binary system. This is a channel to form double neutron star systems, whose merger is detectable with LIGO. SN 2023zaw underscores the existence of a previously undiscovered population of extremely low nickel mass ($< 0.005$ $\mathrm{M\_\odot}$) stripped-envelope supernovae, which can be explored with deep and high-cadence transient surveys.
