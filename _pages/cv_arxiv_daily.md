2023-07-12, **Decoherence effects on lepton number violation from heavy neutrino-antineutrino oscillations**, Stefan Antusch et.al., [2307.06208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06208v1)

 We study decoherence effects and phase corrections in heavy neutrino-antineutrino oscillations (NNOs), based on quantum field theory with external wave packets. Decoherence damps the oscillation pattern, making it harder to resolve experimentally. Additionally, it enhances lepton number violation (LNV) for processes in symmetry-protected low-scale seesaw models by reducing the destructive interference between mass eigenstates. We discuss a novel time-independent shift in the phase and derive formulae for calculating decoherence effects and the phase shift in the relevant regimes, which are the no dispersion regime and transverse dispersion regime. We find that the phase shift can be neglected in the parameter region under consideration since it is small apart from parameter regions with large damping. In the oscillation formulae, decoherence can be included by an effective damping parameter. We discuss this parameter and present averaged results, which apply to simulations of NNOs in the dilepton-dijet channel at the HL-LHC. We show that including decoherence effects can dramatically change the theoretical prediction for the ratio of LNV over LNC events.

 We present an axisymmetric failed supernova simulation beyond black hole formation, for the first time with numerical relativity and two-moment multi energy neutrino transport. To ensure stable numerical evolution, we use an excision method for neutrino radiation-hydrodynamics within the inner part of black hole domain. We demonstrate that our excision method is capable to stably evolve the radiation-hydrodynamics in dynamical black hole spacetime. As a remarkable signature of the final moment of PNS, we find the emergence of high energy neutrinos. Those high energy neutrinos are associated with the proto-neutron star shock surface being swallowed by the central black hole and could be a possible observable of failed supernovae.

2023-07-12, **QCD effective charges from low-energy neutrino structure functions**, Tanjona Rabemananjara et.al., [2307.05969v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05969v1)

 We present a new perspective on the study of the behavior of the strong coupling $\alpha\_s(Q^2)$ -- the fundamental coupling underlying the interactions between quarks and gluons as described by the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) -- in the low-energy infrared (IR) regime. We rely on the NNSF$\nu$ determination of neutrino-nucleus structure functions valid for all values of $Q^2$ from the photoproduction to the high-energy region to define an effective charge following the the Gross-Llewellyn Smith (GLS) sum rule. As a validation, our predictions for the low-energy QCD effective charge are compared to experimental measurements provided by JLab.

2023-07-11, **Practical Dirac Majorana confusion theorem: Issues and Applicability**, C. S. Kim et.al., [2307.05654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05654v1)

 We inspect the model-independent study of practical Dirac Majorana confusion theorem (pDMCT) -- a wide spread belief that the difference between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos via any kinematical observable would be practically impossible to determine because of the difference only being proportional to the square of neutrino mass -- in context of processes that have at least a neutrino antineutrino pair in their final state. We scrutinize the domain of applicability of pDMCT and also highlight those aspects that are often misunderstood. We try to clarify some of the frequently used concepts that are used to assert pDMCT as a generic feature irrespective of the process, or observable, such as the existence of any analytic continuity between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos in the limit mass(neutrino) -> 0. In summary, we illustrate that pDMCT is not any fundamental property of neutrinos, instead, it is a phenomenological feature of neutrino non-observation, depending on models and processes.

2023-07-11, **New Measurements of $^{71}$Ge Decay: Impact on the Gallium Anomaly**, J. I. Collar et.al., [2307.05353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05353v1)

 A dedicated high-statistics measurement of the $^{71}$Ge half-life is found to be in accurate agreement with an accepted value of 11.43$\pm$0.03 d, eliminating a recently proposed route to bypass the "gallium anomaly" affecting several neutrino experiments. Our data also severely constrain the possibility of $^{71}$Ge decay to low-energy excited levels of the $^{71}$Ga daughter nucleus as a solution to this puzzle. Additional unpublished measurements of this decay are discussed. Following the incorporation of this new information, the gallium anomaly survives with high statistical significance.

2023-07-11, **Scalar NSI: A unique tool for constraining absolute neutrino masses via $ν$-oscillations**, Abinash Medhi et.al., [2307.05348v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05348v1)

 In the standard interaction scenario, a direct measurement of absolute neutrino masses via neutrino oscillations is not feasible, as the oscillations depend only on the mass-squared differences. However, the presence of scalar non-standard interactions can introduce sub-dominant terms in the oscillation Hamiltonian that can directly affect the neutrino mass matrix and thereby making scalar NSI a unique tool for neutrino mass measurements. In this work, for the first time, we constrain the absolute masses of neutrinos by probing scalar NSI. We show that a bound on the lightest neutrino mass can be induced in the presence of scalar NSI at DUNE. We find that the lightest neutrino mass can be best constrained with $\eta\_{\tau\tau}$ and $\eta\_{\mu\mu}$ at $2\sigma$ C.L. for normal and inverted hierarchy respectively. This study suggests that scalar NSI can serve as an interesting avenue to constrain the absolute neutrino masses in long-baseline neutrino experiments via neutrino oscillations.

2023-07-11, **Correlating the CDF $W$-mass shift with the muon $g-2$ and the $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions**, Xin-Qiang Li et.al., [2307.05290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05290v1)

 Motivated by the latest CDF $W$-mass measurement as well as the muon $g-2$ anomaly and the discrepancies observed in $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions, we propose an extension of the Standard Model (SM) with the $SU(2)\_L$-singlet vector-like fermion partners that are featured by additional $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry. The fermion partners have the same SM quantum numbers as of the right-handed SM fermions, and can therefore mix with the latter after the electroweak and the $U(1)^\prime$ symmetry breaking. As a result, desirable loop-level corrections to the $(g-2)\_\mu$, the $W$-boson mass $m\_W$ and the Wilson coefficient $C\_9$ in $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ transitions can be obtained. The final allowed parameter space is also consistent with the constraints from the $Z \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay, the neutrino trident production and the LHC direct searches for the vector-like quarks and leptons.

2023-07-11, **Pulsar kicks in ultralight dark matter background induced by neutrino oscillation**, Geatano Lambiase et.al., [2307.05229v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05229v1)

 The interaction of neutrinos with ultralight scalar and vector dark matter backgrounds induce a modification of the neutrino dispersion relation. The effects of this modification are reviewed in the framework of asymmetric emission of neutrinos from the supernova core, and, in turn, of pulsar kicks. We consider the neutrino oscillations, focusing in particular to active-sterile conversion. The ultralight dark matter induced neutrino dispersion relation contains a term of the form $\delta {\bf \Omega}\cdot \hat{{\bf{p}}}$, where $\delta {\bf \Omega}$ is related to the ultralight dark matter field and $\hat{{\bf p}}$ is the unit vector along the direction of neutrino momentum. The relative orientation of ${\bf p}$ with respect to $\delta {\bf \Omega}$ affects the mechanism for the generation of the observed pulsar velocities. We obtain the resonance condition for the active-sterile neutrino oscillation in ultralight dark matter background and calculate the star parameters in the resonance surface so that both ultralight scalar and vector dark matter backgrounds can explain the observed pulsar kicks. The asymmetric emission of neutrinos in presence of ultralight dark matter background results gravitational memory signal which can be probed from the gravitational wave detectors. We also establish a connection between the ultralight dark matter parameters and the standard model extension parameter.

2023-07-11, **Measuring the Sterile Neutrino Mass in Spallation Source and Direct Detection Experiments**, David Alonso-González et.al., [2307.05176v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05176v1)

 We explore the complementarity of direct detection (DD) and spallation source (SS) experiments for the study of sterile neutrino physics. We focus on the sterile baryonic neutrino model: an extension of the Standard Model that introduces a massive sterile neutrino with couplings to the quark sector via a new gauge boson. In this scenario, the inelastic scattering of an active neutrino with the target material in both DD and SS experiments gives rise to a characteristic nuclear recoil energy spectrum that can allow for the reconstruction of the neutrino mass in the event of a positive detection. We first derive new bounds on this model based on the data from the COHERENT collaboration on CsI and LAr targets, which we find do not yet probe new areas of the parameter space. We then assess how well future SS experiments will be able to measure the sterile neutrino mass and mixings, showing that masses in the range 15-50 MeV can be reconstructed. We show that there is a degeneracy in the measurement of the sterile neutrino mixing that substantially affects the reconstruction of parameters for masses of the order of 40 MeV. Thanks to their lower energy threshold and sensitivity to the solar tau neutrino flux, DD experiments allow us to partially lift the degeneracy in the sterile neutrino mixings and considerably improve its mass reconstruction down to 9 MeV. Our results demonstrate the excellent complementarity between DD and SS experiments in measuring the sterile neutrino mass and highlight the power of DD experiments in searching for new physics in the neutrino sector.

2023-07-11, **Observational Constraints on generalized dark matter properties in the presence of neutrinos with final Plank release**, Santosh Kumar Yadav et.al., [2307.05155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05155v1)

 In this paper, we investigate an extension of standard $\Lambda$CDM model by allowing: a temporal evolution in the equation of state (EoS) of DM via Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization, and the constant non-null sound speed. We also consider the properties of neutrinos, such as the effective neutrino mass and the effective number of neutrino species as free parameters. We derive the constraints on this scenario by using the data from the Planck-2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), the local value of the Hubble constant from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and some large scale structure (LSS) information from the abundance of galaxy clusters. We find constraints on the EoS and sound speed of DM very close to the null value in all cases thus no significant evidence can be stated beyond the standard CDM paradigm, and we conclude that the present observational data favor DM as a pressureless fluid. In all cases, we find the tighter upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses. The most tight upper bound is $\sum m\_\nu < 0.17$ eV at 95\% CL, imposed with the addition of HST prior in the analysis. We also observe the effects of neutrino properties on the extended DM parameters and also on other parameters. We find significantly lower mean values of $\sigma\_8$ in all cases which are in agreement with the LSS measurements. Thus, the well-known $\sigma\_8$ tension is reconciled in the considered model.

2023-07-11, **Dissecting the $γ$-ray emissions of the nearby galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 253**, Shunhao Ji et.al., [2307.05142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05142v1)

 Intrigued by recent high-energy study results for nearby galaxies with gamma-ray emission and in particular NGC~1068 that has been detected as a neutrino-emitting source by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we conduct detailed analysis of the $\gamma$-ray data for the galaxies NGC~1068 and NGC~253, obtained with the Large Area Telescope onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope}. By checking for their possible spectral features and then constructing light curves in corresponding energy ranges, we identify flare-like activity from NGC ~1068 in $\geq$2\,GeV energy range and significant long-term variations of NGC~253 in $\geq$5\,GeV energy range. In the former, the emission appears harder in the two half-year flare-like events than that in the otherwise `quiescent' state. In the latter, there is a 2-times decrease in the flux before and after MJD~57023, which is clearly revealed by the test-statistic maps we obtain. Considering studies carried out and models proposed for the $\gamma$-ray emissions of the two sources, we discuss the implications of our findings. The jet in NGC~1068 may contribute to the \gr\ emission. The nature of the long-term variations in NGC~253 is not clear, but the variation part of the emission may be connected to the very-high-energy (VHE) emission of the galaxy and could be verified by VHE observations.

2023-07-11, **Peeking into the next decade in Large-Scale Structure Cosmology with its Effective Field Theory**, Diogo Bragança et.al., [2307.04992v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04992v1)

 After the successful full-shape analyses of BOSS data using the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure, we investigate what upcoming galaxy surveys might achieve. We introduce a ``perturbativity prior" that ensures that loop terms are as large as theoretically expected, which is effective in the case of a large number of EFT parameters. After validating our technique by comparison with already-performed analyses of BOSS data, we provide Fisher forecasts using the one-loop prediction for power spectrum and bispectrum for two benchmark surveys: DESI and MegaMapper. We find overall great improvements on the cosmological parameters. In particular, we find that MegaMapper (DESI) should obtain at least a 12$\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) evidence for non-vanishing neutrino masses, bound the curvature $\Omega\_k$ to 0.0012 (0.012), and primordial inflationary non-Gaussianities as follows: $f\_{\text{NL}}^{\text{loc.}}$ to $\pm 0.26$ (3.3), $f\_{\text{NL}}^{\text{eq.}}$ to $\pm16$ (92), $f\_{\text{NL}}^{\text{orth.}}$ to $\pm 4.2$ (27). Such measurements would provide much insight on the theory of Inflation. We investigate the limiting factor of shot noise and ignorance of the EFT parameters.

2023-07-12, **Bayesian analysis of Unified Dark Matter models with fast transition: can they alleviate the $H_{0}$ tension?**, Emmanuel Frion et.al., [2307.06320v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06320v1)

 We consider cosmological models in which Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) are described by a single component, dubbed Unified Dark Matter (UDM) models, in which the DE-like part can have an equation state $<-1$ at late times without violating the null energy condition. In this paper, we investigate whether this feature can relieve the Hubble tension. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the model using SNIa data from Pantheon, the CMB distance prior from Planck, and the prior on the absolute magnitude $M$ of SNIa from SH0ES. The data suggests a smooth transition taking place at redshifts $z\_{\rm t} \simeq 2.85$, which provides a value $H\_0=69.64\pm 0.88$ for the Hubble constant, slightly alleviating the tension by $\sim 1.5 \sigma$. We also discuss the importance of using the prior on $M$ for constraining this model.

2023-07-12, **Bending instabilities of m=1 mode in disc galaxies: interplay between dark matter halo and vertical pressure**, Sagar S. Goyary et.al., [2307.06063v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06063v1)

 A self-gravitating, differentially rotating galactic disc under vertical hydrostatic equilibrium is supported by the vertical pressure gradient force against the gravitational collapse. Such discs are known to support various bending modes e.g., warps, corrugation, or scalloping (typically, higher order bending modes) of which m=1 bending modes (warps) are the most prevalent ones in galactic discs. Here, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the bending instability in realistic models of disc galaxies in which an exponential stellar disc is under vertical equilibrium and residing in a cold rigid dark matter halo. A quadratic eigenvalue equation describing the bending modes is formulated and solved for the complete eigen spectrum for a set of model disc galaxies by varying their physical properties such as disc scale-height, and dark matter halo mass. It is shown that the vertical pressure gradient force can excite unstable bending modes in such a disc as well as large scale discrete modes. Further, it is shown that the unstable eigen-modes in a thinner disc grow faster than those in a thicker disc. The bending instabilities are found to be suppressed in discs dominated by massive dark matter halo. We estimate the growth timescales and corresponding wavelength of the m=1 unstable bending modes in Milky Way like galaxies and discuss its implication.

 Cosmological simulations describing the evolution of density perturbations of a self-gravitating collisionless Dark Matter (DM) fluid in an expanding background, provide a powerful tool to follow the formation of cosmic structures over wide dynamic ranges. The most widely adopted approach, based on the N-body discretization of the collisionless Vlasov-Poisson (VP) equations, is hampered by an unfavourable scaling when simulating the wide range of scales needed to cover at the same time the formation of single galaxies and of the largest cosmic structures. On the other hand, the dynamics described by the VP equations is limited by the rapid increase of the number of resolution elements (grid points and/or particles) which is required to simulate an ever growing range of scales. Recent studies showed an interesting mapping of the 6-dimensional+1 (6D+1) VP problem into a more amenable 3D+1 non-linear Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) problem for simulating the evolution of DM perturbations. This opens up the possibility of improving the scaling of time propagation simulations using quantum computing. In this paper, we develop a rigorous formulation of a variational-time evolution quantum algorithm for the simulation of the SP equations to follow DM perturbations, presenting a thorough analysis of the scaling of the algorithm as a function of spatial dimensions and resolution. Finally we investigate the transition of the SP dynamics towards the classical limit, which could become an efficient alternative to the solution of the VP equation.

2023-07-12, **Constraints on Self-Interacting dark matter from relaxed galaxy groups**, Gopika K. et.al., [2307.05880v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05880v1)

 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) has been proposed as an alternative to the standard collisionless cold dark matter to explain the diversity of galactic rotation curves and core-cusp problems seen at small scales. Here, we estimate the constraints on SIDM for a sample of 11 relaxed galaxy groups with X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton. We fit the dark matter density distribution to the Einasto profile and use the estimated Einasto $\alpha$ parameter to constrain the SIDM cross-section, based on the empirical relation between the two, which was obtained in Eckert et al (2022). We obtain a non-zero central estimate for the cross-section per unit mass ($\sigma/m$) for seven groups, with the most precise estimate obtained for NGC 5044, given by $\sigma/m=0.165 \pm 0.025~\rm{cm^2/g}$, for dark matter velocity dispersion of about 300 km/sec. For the remaining four groups, we obtain 95% c.l. upper limits on $\sigma/m < 0.16-6.61~\rm{cm^2/g}$ with dark matter velocity dispersions between 200-500 km/sec, with the most stringent limit for our sample obtained for the group MKW 4, given by $\sigma/m< 0.16~\rm{cm^2/g}$ for dark matter velocity dispersion of about 350 km/sec.

2023-07-11, **On the Bimetric Starobinsky Model**, Ioannis D. Gialamas et.al., [2307.05673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05673v1)

 The Bimetric theory of gravity is an extension of General Relativity that describes a massive spin-$2$ particle in addition to the standard massless graviton. The theory is based on two dynamical metric tensors with their interactions constrained by requiring the absence of the so-called Boulware-Deser ghost. It has been realized that the quantum interactions of matter fields with gravity are bound to generate modifications to the standard Einstein-Hilbert action such as quadratic curvature terms. Such a quadratic Ricci scalar term is present in the so-called Starobinsky model which has been proven to be rather robust in its inflationary predictions. In the present article we study a generalization of the Starobinsky model within the bimetric theory and find that its inflationary behaviour stays intact while keeping all consistency requirements of the bimetric framework. The interpretation of the massive spin-2 particle as dark matter remains a viable scenario, as in standard Bigravity.

2023-07-11, **Axions and Cosmic Magnetic Fields**, George B. Field et.al., [2307.05425v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05425v1)

 We argue that if axions are the dark matter, their coupling to electromagnetism results in exponential growth of a helical magnetic field when the axion field first rolls down its potential. After an inverse cascade, the relevant length scales to day are of order 10-100 kpc, of astrophysical interest. Our mechanism for allowing the field to grow relies on a nuance of MHD. Faraday's Law says that an electric field is needed to create a magnetic field. Previous authors relied on conventional Ohm's law to calculate E, but the resistivity is negligible and therefore they assume E is as well. We use a modified Ohm's Law that includes the effects of self-induction in limiting the current driven by a given E, which allows a magnetic field to grow.

2023-07-11, **The filament determination depends on the tracer: comparing filaments based on dark matter particles and galaxies in the GAEA semi-analytic model**, Daria Zakharova et.al., [2307.05240v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05240v1)

 Filaments are elongated structures that connect groups and clusters of galaxies and are visually the striking feature in cosmological maps. In the literature, typically filaments are defined only using galaxies, assuming that these are good tracers of the dark matter distribution, despite the fact that galaxies are a biased indicator. Here we apply the topological filament extractor DisPerSE to the predictions of the semi-analytic code GAEA to investigate the correspondence between the properties of $z=0$ filaments extracted using the distribution of dark matter and the distribution of model galaxies evolving within the same large-scale structure. We focus on filaments around massive clusters with a mass comparable to Virgo and Coma, with the intent of investigating the influence of massive systems and their feeding filamentary structure on the physical properties of galaxies. We apply different methods to compare the properties of filaments based on the different tracers and study how the sample selection impacts the extraction. Overall, filaments extracted using different tracers agree, although they never coincide totally. We also find that the number of filaments ending up in the massive clusters identified using galaxies distribution is typically underestimated with respect to the corresponding dark matter filament extraction.

2023-07-11, **EDGE: The direct link between mass growth history and the extended stellar haloes of the faintest dwarf galaxies**, Alex Goater et.al., [2307.05130v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05130v1)

 Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are commonly found in close proximity to the Milky Way and other massive spiral galaxies. As such, their projected stellar ellipticity and extended light distributions are often thought to owe to tidal forces. In this paper, we study the projected stellar ellipticities and faint stellar outskirts of tidally isolated ultra-faints drawn from the 'Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy Formation's Edge' (EDGE) cosmological simulation suite. Despite their tidal isolation, our simulated dwarfs exhibit a wide range of projected ellipticities ($0.03 < \varepsilon < 0.85$), with many possessing anisotropic extended stellar haloes that mimic tidal tails, but owe instead to late-time accretion of lower mass companions. Furthermore, we find a strong causal relationship between ellipticity and formation time of an UFD, which is robust to a wide variation in the feedback model. We show that the distribution of projected ellipticities in our suite of simulated EDGE dwarfs matches well with that of 21 Local Group dwarf galaxies. Given the ellipticity in EDGE arises from an ex-situ accretion origin, the agreement in shape indicates the ellipticities of some observed dwarfs may also originate from a similar non-tidal scenario. The orbital parameters of these observed dwarfs further support that they are not currently tidally disrupting. If the baryonic content in these galaxies is still tidally intact, then the same may be true for their dark matter content, making these galaxies in our Local Group pristine laboratories for testing dark matter and galaxy formation models.

2023-07-12, **The Spatial and Emission Properties of the Large [O III] Emission Nebula Near M31**, Robert A. Fesen et.al., [2307.06308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06308v1)

 Drechsler et al. (2023) reported the unexpected discovery of a 1.5 degree long [O III] emission nebula 1.2 degrees southeast of the M31 nucleus. Here we present additional images of this large emission structure, called SDSO, along with radial velocity and flux measurements from low-dispersion spectra. Independent sets of [O III] images show SDSO to be composed of broad streaks of diffuse emission aligned NE-SW. Deep H$\alpha$ images reveal no strong coincident emission suggesting a high [O III]/H$\alpha$ ratio. We also find no other [O III] emission nebulosity as bright as SDSO within several degrees of M31 and no filamentary H$\alpha$ emission connected to SDSO. Optical spectra taken along the arc's northern limb reveal [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emissions matching the location and extent seen in our [O III] images. The heliocentric velocity of this [O III] nebulosity is $-9.8 \pm 6.8$ km s$^{-1}$ with a peak surface brightness of $(4\pm2) \times 10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ ($\sim$0.55 Rayleigh). We discuss SDSO as a possible unrecognized supernova remnant, a large and unusually nearby planetary nebula, a stellar bow shock nebula, or an interaction of M31's outer halo gas with high-velocity circumgalactic gas. We conclude that galactic origins for SDSO are unlikely and favor instead an extragalactic M31 halo--circumgalactic cloud interaction scenario, despite the nebula's low radial velocity. We then describe new observations that may help resolve the true nature and origin of this large nebulosity so close to M31 in the sky.

2023-07-12, **An Alternative Formation Scenario for Uranium-rich Giants: Engulfing a Earth-like Planet**, Dian Xie et.al., [2307.05907v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05907v1)

 The actinides, such as the uranium (U) element, are typically synthesized through the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), which can occur in core-collapse supernovae or double neutron star mergers. There exist nine r-process giant stars exhibiting conspicuousUabundances, commonly referred to as U-rich giants. However, the origins of these U-rich giants remain ambiguous. We propose an alternative formation scenario for these U-rich giants whereby a red giant (RG) engulfs an Earth-like planet. To approximate the process of a RG engulfing an Earth-like planet, we employ an accretion model wherein the RG assimilates materials from said planet. Our findings demonstrate that this engulfment event can considerably enhance the presence of heavy elements originating from Earth-like planets on the surfaces of very metal-poor stars (Z = 0.00001), while its impact on solar-metallicity stars is comparatively modest. Importantly, the structural and evolutionary properties of both very metalpoor and solar-metallicity stars remain largely unaffected. Notably, our engulfment model effectively accounts for the observed U abundances in known U-rich giants. Furthermore, the evolutionary trajectories of U abundances on the surfaces of RGs subsequent to the engulfment of Earth-like planets encompass all known U-rich giants. Therefore, it is plausible that U-rich giants are formed when a RG engulfs an Earth-like planet.

 Time delays from strong gravitational lensing provide a one-step absolute distance measurement. Thus, they measure $H\_0$ independently of all other probes. We first review the foundations and history of time-delay cosmography. Then, we illustrate the current state of the art by means of two recent case studies that have been real breakthroughs: i) the quadruply imaged quasar lensed by a galaxy-scale deflector RXJ1131$-$1231, for which spatially resolved stellar kinematics is available; ii) the multiply imaged supernova "Refsdal", the first with measured time delays, lensed by cluster MACS1149.5$+$2223. We conclude by discussing the exciting future prospects of time-delay cosmography in the coming decade.

2023-07-11, **Dependence of peculiar velocity on the host properties of the gravitational wave sources and its impact on the measurement of Hubble constant**, Harshank Nimonkar et.al., [2307.05688v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05688v1)

 Accurate measurement of the low redshift expansion rate, the Hubble constant from standard sirens such as the gravitational wave (GW) sources with electromagnetic counterparts relies on the robust peculiar velocity correction of the redshift of the host galaxy. We show in this work that the peculiar velocity of the host galaxies exhibit a correlation with the properties of the host galaxy primarily such as its stellar mass and this correlation also evolves with redshift. As the galaxies of higher stellar mass tend to form in galaxies with higher halo masses which are located in spatial regions having a non-linear fluctuation in the density field of the matter distribution, the root mean square (RMS) peculiar velocity of the heavier galaxies is higher. As a result, depending on the formation channel of the binary compact objects and whether they are likely to be hosted in galaxies with less stellar mass or more stellar mass, the peculiar velocity contamination to the galaxies will be different. The variation in the peculiar velocity of the host galaxies can lead to a significant variation in the posterior distribution of Hubble constant inferred using sources such as Binary Neutron Stars (BNSs), depending on the underlying population of the BNS to host in a galaxy with higher stellar mass. We find that for the network of GW detectors such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK), LVK+LIGO-India, Cosmic Explorer+Einstein Telescope, the variation in the precision of Hubble constant inferred from 10 bright siren events can vary from $\sim 5.4 - 6\%$, $\sim 4.5 - 5.3\%$ and $\sim 1.1 - 2.7\%$ respectively. The impact of the correlation of peculiar velocity with the stellar mass on the inference of Hubble constant is not only limited to GW sources but also applicable to other low redshift probes of expansion history such as type-Ia supernovae.

 The Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS) is a proposed space-based X-ray telescope for detecting X-ray emissions from the hot gas content in our universe. With its unprecedented spatially-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy and large field of view, the HUBS mission will be uniquely qualified to measure the physical and chemical properties of the hot gas in the interstellar medium, the circumgalactic medium, the intergalactic medium, and the intracluster medium. These measurements will be valuable for two key scientific goals of HUBS, namely to unravel the AGN and stellar feedback physics that governs the formation and evolution of galaxies, and to probe the baryon budget and multi-phase states from galactic to cosmological scales. In addition to these two goals, the HUBS mission will also help us solve some problems in the fields of galaxy clusters, AGNs, diffuse X-ray backgrounds, supernova remnants, and compact objects. This paper discusses the perspective of advancing these fields using the HUBS telescope.

2023-07-11, **The Dependence of Iron-rich Metal-poor Star Occurrence on Galactic Environment Supports an Origin in Thermonuclear Supernova Nucleosynthesis**, Zachary Reeves et.al., [2307.05669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05669v1)

 It has been suggested that a class of chemically peculiar metal-poor stars called iron-rich metal-poor (IRMP) stars formed from molecular cores with metal contents dominated by thermonuclear supernova nucleosynthesis. If this interpretation is accurate, then IRMP stars should be more common in environments where thermonuclear supernovae were important contributors to chemical evolution. Conversely, IRMP stars should be less common in environments where thermonuclear supernovae were not important contributors to chemical evolution. At constant $[\text{Fe/H}] \lesssim -1$, the Milky Way's satellite classical dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies and the Magellanic Clouds have lower $[\text{$\alpha$/Fe}]$ than the Milky Way field and globular cluster populations. This difference is thought to demonstrate the importance of thermonuclear supernova nucleosynthesis for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way's satellite classical dSph galaxies and the Magellanic Clouds. We use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and Gaia to infer the occurrence of IRMP stars in the Milky Way's satellite classical dSph galaxies $\eta\_{\text{dSph}}$ and the Magellanic Clouds $\eta\_{\text{Mag}}$ as well as in the Milky Way field $\eta\_{\text{MWF}}$ and globular cluster populations $\eta\_{\text{MWGC}}$. In order of decreasing occurrence, we find $\eta\_{\text{dSph}}=0.07\_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$, $\eta\_{\text{Mag}}=0.037\_{-0.006}^{+0.007}$, $\eta\_{\text{MWF}}=0.0013\_{-0.0005}^{+0.0006}$, and a 1-$\sigma$ upper limit $\eta\_{\text{MWGC}}<0.00057$. These occurrences support the inference that IRMP stars formed in environments dominated by thermonuclear supernova nucleosynthesis and that the time lag between the formation of the first and second stellar generations in globular clusters was longer than the thermonuclear supernova delay time.

2023-07-11, **A helium nova in the Large Magellanic Cloud -- the faint supersoft X-ray source [HP99]159**, Mariko Kato et.al., [2307.05278v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05278v1)

 We propose a helium nova model for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) supersoft X-ray source (SSS) [HP99]159. This object has long been detected as a faint and persistent SSS for about 30 years, and recently been interpreted to be a source of steady helium-shell burning, because no hydrogen lines are observed. We find that the object can also be interpreted as in a decaying phase of a helium nova. The helium nova is slowly decaying toward the quiescent phase, during which the observed temperature, luminosity, and SSS lifetime ($\gtrsim 30$ years) are consistent with a massive white dwarf model of $\sim$ 1.2 $M\_\odot$. If it is the case, this is the second discovery of a helium nova outburst after V445 Pup in our Galaxy and also the first identified helium nova in the LMC. We also discuss the nature of the companion helium star in relation to Type Ia supernova progenitors.
