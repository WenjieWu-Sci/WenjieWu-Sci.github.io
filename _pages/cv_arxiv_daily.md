2023-08-31, **Meld: Exploring the Feasibility of a Framework-less Framework**, Kyle J. Knoepfel et.al., [2308.16710v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16710v1)

 HEP data-processing frameworks are essential ingredients in getting from raw data to physics results. But they are often tricky to use well, and they present a significant learning barrier for the beginning HEP physicist. In addition, existing frameworks typically support rigid, collider-based data models, which do not map well to neutrino-physics experiments like DUNE. Neutrino physicists thus expend significant effort working around framework limitations instead of using a framework that directly supports their needs.   Presented here is Meld, a Fermilab R&D project, which intends to address these limitations. By leveraging modern C++ capabilities, state-of-the-art concurrency libraries, and a flexible data model, it is possible for beginning (and seasoned) HEP physicists to execute framework programs easily and efficiently, with minimal coupling to framework-specific constructs. Meld aims to directly support the frameworks needs of neutrino experiments like DUNE as well as the more common collider-based experiments.

2023-08-31, **H.E.S.S. realtime follow-ups of IceCube high-energy neutrino alerts**, Federica Bradascio et.al., [2308.16699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16699v1)

 The evidence for multi-messenger photon and neutrino emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056 has demonstrated the importance of realtime follow-up of neutrino events by various ground- and space-based facilities. The effort of H.E.S.S. and other experiments in coordinating observations to obtain quasi-simultaneous multiwavelength flux and spectrum measurements has been critical in measuring the chance coincidence with the high-energy neutrino event IC-170922A and constraining theoretical models. For about a decade, the H.E.S.S. transient program has included a search for gamma-ray emission associated with high-energy neutrino alerts, looking for gamma-ray activity from known sources and newly detected emitters consistent with the neutrino location. In this contribution, we present an overview of follow-up activities for realtime neutrino alerts with H.E.S.S. in 2021 and 2022. Our analysis includes both public IceCube neutrino alerts and alerts exchanged as part of a joint H.E.S.S.-IceCube program. We focus on interesting coincidences observed with gamma-ray sources, particularly highlighting the significant detection of PKS 0625-35, an AGN previously detected by H.E.S.S., and three IceCube neutrinos.

2023-08-31, **Probing the dipole portal to heavy neutral leptons via meson decays at the high-luminosity LHC**, Daniele Barducci et.al., [2308.16608v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16608v1)

 We consider the dipole portal to sterile neutrinos, also called heavy neutral leptons (HNLs). The dipole interaction with the photon leads to HNL production in meson decays, as well as triggers the HNL decay into an active neutrino and a photon. HNLs with masses of order of 0.01-1 GeV are naturally long-lived if the dipole coupling is sufficiently small. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations and derive the sensitivities of the proposed FASER2 and FACET long-lived particle experiments to HNLs produced via the dipole operator in meson decays at the high-luminosity LHC. Our findings show that these future detectors will be complementary to each other, as well as to existing experiments, and will be able to probe new parts of the parameter space, especially in the case of the dipole operator coupled to the tau neutrino.

2023-08-31, **Measurements of the $ν_μ$ and $\barν_μ$-induced Coherent Charged Pion Production Cross Sections on $^{12}C$ by the T2K experiment**, K. Abe et.al., [2308.16606v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16606v1)

 We report an updated measurement of the $\nu\_{\mu}$-induced, and the first measurement of the $\bar{\nu}\_{\mu}$-induced coherent charged pion production cross section on $^{12}C$ nuclei in the T2K experiment. This is measured in a restricted region of the final-state phase space for which $p\_{\mu,\pi} > 0.2$ GeV, $\cos(\theta\_{\mu}) > 0.8$ and $\cos(\theta\_{\pi}) > 0.6$, and at a mean (anti)neutrino energy of 0.85 GeV using the T2K near detector. The measured $\nu\_{\mu}$ CC coherent pion production flux-averaged cross section on $^{12}C$ is $(2.98 \pm 0.37 (stat.) \pm 0.31 (syst.) \substack{ +0.49 \\ -0.00 } \mathrm{ (Q^2\,model)}) \times 10^{-40}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. The new measurement of the $\bar{\nu}\_{\mu}$-induced cross section on $^{12}{C}$ is $(3.05 \pm 0.71 (stat.) \pm 0.39 (syst.) \substack{ +0.74 \\ -0.00 } \mathrm{(Q^2\,model)}) \times 10^{-40}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. The results are compatible with both the NEUT 5.4.0 Berger-Sehgal (2009) and GENIE 2.8.0 Rein-Sehgal (2007) model predictions.

2023-08-31, **Fast neutron star cooling in light of the PREX-2 experiment**, Trisha Sarkar et.al., [2308.16449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16449v1)

 The nuclear symmetry energy and its behaviour with density has been recently evaluated with enhanced value by PREX-2 experiment. This new values enables direct Urca neutrino emission process to be functioning in the dense matter inside neutron stars. With this new outlook we study the cooling rate of canonical mass neutron stars and compare with available observational cooling data. We find most of the isolated neutron star thermal profile is compatible with the cooling of canonical mass star including superfluidity suppression.

2023-08-30, **Time Calibration of the Baikal-GVD Neutrino Telescope with Atmospheric Muons**, V. M. Aynutdinov et.al., [2308.16351v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16351v1)

 We present a new procedure for time calibration of the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope. The track reconstruction quality depends on accurate measurements of arrival times of Cherenkov photons. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a high precision in time calibration. For that purpose, in addition to other calibration methods, we employ a new procedure using atmospheric muons reconstructed in a single-cluster mode. The method is based on iterative determination of effective time offsets for each optical module. This paper focuses on the results of the iterative reconstruction procedure with time offsets from the previous iteration and the verification of the method developed. The theoretical muon calibration precision is estimated to be around 1.5-1.6ns.

2023-08-30, **Secular Outflows from 3D-MHD Hypermassive Neutron Star Accretion Disk Systems**, Steven Fahlman et.al., [2308.16237v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16237v1)

 Magnetized hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs) have been proposed as a way for neutron star (NS) mergers to produce high electron fraction, high velocity ejecta, as required by kilonova models to explain the observed light curve of GW170817. The HMNS drives outflows through neutrino energy deposition and mechanical oscillations, and raises the electron fraction of outflows through neutrino interactions before collapsing to a black hole (BH). Here we perform 3D numerical simulations of HMNS-torus systems in ideal magnetohydrodynamics, using a leakage/absorption scheme for neutrino transport, the nuclear APR equation of state, and Newtonian self-gravity, with a pseudo-Newtonian potential added after BH formation. Due to the uncertainty in the HMNS collapse time, we choose two different parameterized times to induce collapse. We also explore two initial magnetic field geometries in the torus, and evolve the systems until the outflows diminish significantly ($\sim 1 - 2$ $\mathrm{s}$). We find bluer, faster outflows as compared to equivalent BH-torus systems, producing $M\sim 10^{-3} M\_\odot$ of ejecta with $Y\_e \geq 0.25$ and $v \geq 0.25c$ by the simulation end. Approximately half the outflows are launched in disk winds at times $t\lesssim 500$ $\mathrm{ms}$, with a broad distribution of electron fractions and velocities, depending on the initial condition. The remaining outflows are thermally-driven, characterized by lower velocities and electron fractions. Nucleosynthesis with tracer particles shows patterns resembling solar abundances in all models. Although outflows from our simulations do not match those inferred from two-component modelling of the GW170817 kilonova, self-consistent multidimensional detailed kilonova models are required to determine if our outflows can power the blue kilonova.

2023-08-30, **Neutrino anisotropy as a probe of extreme astrophysical accelerators**, Marco Stein Muzio et.al., [2308.16225v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16225v1)

 We consider how the cutoff of the ultrahigh energy neutrino spectrum introduces an effective neutrino horizon, allowing for future neutrino detectors to measure an anisotropy in neutrino arrival directions driven by the local large-scale structure. We show that measurement of the level of this anisotropy along with features of the neutrino spectrum will allow for a measurement of the evolution of ultrahigh energy neutrino sources, which are expected to also be the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.

2023-08-30, **Lepton-induced reactions on nuclei in a wide kinematical regime**, U. Mosel et.al., [2308.16161v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16161v1)

 Inclusive differential cross sections for various $e A$ and $\nu A$ reactions are analyzed within the GiBUU theoretical framework and code. The treatment of electron-nuclus reactions has been significantly improved by implementing a parametrized description of electron-nucleon interactions for a nucleon. Using the momentum of a nucleon inside the Fermi sea the electron-nucleon cross sections are then Lorentz-boosted to obtain the electron structure functions for nuclei. The neutrino structure functions are obtained from the ones for electrons by a transformation that involves the axial formfactors and kinematical factors that account for the difference of vector and axial currents. Special emphasis is put on analyzing data from various different experiments in different neutrino energy regimes with one and the same theoretical input.

2023-08-30, **Neutrino constraints on inelastic dark matter captured in the Sun**, Bhavesh Chauhan et.al., [2308.16134v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16134v1)

 The flux of neutrinos from annihilation of gravitationally captured dark matter in the Sun has significant constraints from direct-detection experiments. However, these constraints are relaxed for inelastic dark matter as inelastic dark matter interactions generate less energetic nuclear recoils compared to elastic dark matter interactions. In this paper, we explore the possibility for large volume underground neutrino experiments to detect the neutrino flux from captured inelastic dark matter in the Sun. The neutrino spectrum has two components: a mono-energetic "spike" from pion and kaon decays at rest and a broad-spectrum "shoulder" from prompt primary meson decays. We focus on detecting the shoulder neutrinos from annihilation of hadrophilic inelastic dark matter with masses in the range 4-100 GeV and the mass splittings in up to 300 keV. We determine the event selection criterion for DUNE to identify GeV-scale muon neutrinos and anti-neutrinos originating from hadrophilic dark matter annihilation in the Sun, and forecast the sensitivity from contained events. We also map the current bounds from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube on elastic dark matter, as well as the projected limits from Hyper-Kamiokande, to the parameter space of inelastic dark matter. We find that there is a region of parameter space that these neutrino experiments are more sensitive to than the direct-detection experiments. For dark matter annihilation to heavy-quarks, the projected sensitivity of DUNE is weaker than current (future) Super (Hyper) Kamiokande experiments. However, for the light-quark channel, only the spike is observable and DUNE will be the most sensitive experiment.

2023-08-30, **Shedding light on neutrino self-interactions with solar antineutrino searches**, Quan-feng Wu et.al., [2308.15849v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15849v1)

 Solar antineutrinos are absent in the standard solar model prediction. Consequently, solar antineutrino searches emerge as a powerful tool to probe new physics capable of converting neutrinos into antineutrinos. In this study, we highlight that neutrino self-interactions, recently gaining considerable attention due to their cosmological and astrophysical implications, can lead to significant solar antineutrino production. We systematically explore various types of four-fermion effective operators and light scalar mediators for neutrino self-interactions. By estimating the energy spectra and event rates of solar antineutrinos at prospective neutrino detectors such as JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande, and THEIA, we reveal that solar antineutrino searches can impose stringent constraints on neutrino self-interactions and probe the parameter space favored by the Hubble tension.

2023-08-30, **A Dual-Zone Diffusion Model for High Energy Emissions of the Cygnus Cocoon**, Shihong Zhan et.al., [2308.15831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15831v1)

 As one of the brightest galactic ${\gamma}$-ray sources, the Cygnus Cocoon superbubble has been observed by many detectors, such as $Fermi$-LAT, ARGO, HAWC, and LHAASO. However, the origin of $\gamma$-ray emission for the Cygnus Cocoon and the possible contribution to PeV cosmic rays are still under debate. The recent ultrahigh-energy $\gamma$-ray observations by LHAASO up to 1.4 PeV towards the direction of the Cygnus Cocoon, as well as the neutrino event report of IceCube-201120A coming from the same direction, suggest that the Cygnus Cocoon may be one of the sources of high-energy cosmic rays in the Galaxy. In this work, we propose a dual-zone diffusion model for the Cygnus Cocoon: the cocoon region and surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This scenario can account for the $\gamma$-ray data from GeV to $\sim$ 50 TeV and agree with the one sub-PeV neutrino event result from IceCube so far. Moreover, it predict a non-negligible contribution $\gamma$-ray emission at hundreds TeV from the ISM surrounding the Cygnus Cocoon. This possible diffuse TeV-PeV gamma-ray features can be resolved by the future LHAASO observations.

2023-08-30, **Overview and First Results of EUSO-SPB2**, Johannes Eser et.al., [2308.15693v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15693v2)

 Observing ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and very high energy (VHE) neutrinos from space is a promising way to measure their extremely low fluxes by significantly increasing the observed volume. The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2), the next, most advanced pathfinder for such a mission, was launched May 13th 2023 from Wanaka New Zealand. The pioneering EUSO-SPB2 payload flew a Fluorescence Telescope (FT) with a PMT camera pointed in nadir to record fluorescence light from cosmic ray extensive air shower (EAS) with energies above 1 EeV, and a Cherenkov telescope (CT) with a silicon photomultiplier focal surface for observing Cherenkov emission of cosmic ray EAS with energies above 1 PeV with an above-the-limb geometry and of PeV-scale EAS initiated by neutrino-sourced tau decay. As the CT is a novel instrument, optical background measurements for space neutrino observation are an important goal of the mission. Any data collected during the mission will influence and improve the development of a space-based multi-messenger observatory such as the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). We present an overview of the EUSO-SPB2 mission and its science goals and summarize results as available, from the 2023 flight.

2023-08-31, **Search for the gamma-ray spectral lines with the DAMPE and the Fermi-LAT observations**, Ji-Gui Cheng et.al., [2308.16762v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16762v1)

 Weakly interacting massive particles, as a major candidate of dark matter (DM), may directly annihilate or decay into high-energy photons, producing monochromatic spectral lines in the gamma-ray band. These spectral lines, if detected, are smoking-gun signatures for the existence of new physics. Using the 5 years of DAMPE and 13 years of Fermi-LAT data, we search for line-like signals in the energy range of 3 GeV to 1 TeV from the Galactic halo. Different regions of interest are considered to accommodate different DM density profiles. We do not find any significant line structure, and the previously reported line-like feature at $\sim$133 GeV is also not detected in our analysis. Adopting a local DM density of $\rho\_{\rm local}=0.4\,{\rm GeV\,cm^{-3}}$, we derive 95% confidence level constraints on the velocity-averaged cross-section of $\langle{\sigma v}\rangle\_{\gamma\gamma} \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and the decay lifetime of $\tau\_{\gamma\nu} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{29}\,{\rm s}$ at 100 GeV, achieving the strongest constraints to date for the line energies of 6-660 GeV. The improvement stems from the longer Fermi-LAT data set used and the inclusion of DAMPE data in the analysis. The simultaneous use of two independent data sets could also reduce the systematic uncertainty of the search.

2023-08-31, **21cm signal sensitivity to dark matter decay**, Gaétan Facchinetti et.al., [2308.16656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16656v1)

 The redshifted 21cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn is expected to provide unprecedented insights into early Universe astrophysics and cosmology. Here we explore how dark matter can heat the intergalactic medium before the first galaxies, leaving a distinctive imprint in the 21cm power spectrum. We provide the first dedicated Fisher matrix forecasts on the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope to dark matter decays. We show that with 1000 hours of observation, HERA has the potential to improve current cosmological constraints on the dark matter decay lifetime by up to three orders of magnitude. Even in extreme scenarios with strong X-ray emission from early-forming, metal-free galaxies, the bounds on the decay lifetime would be improved by up to two orders of magnitude. Overall, HERA shall improve on existing limits for dark matter masses below $2$ GeV$/c^2$ for decays into $e^+e^-$ and below few MeV$/c^2$ for decays into photons.

2023-08-31, **Gravitational Lensing in Modified Gravity: A case study for Fast Radio Bursts**, Surajit Kalita et.al., [2308.16604v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16604v1)

 Over the last few decades, a plethora of modifications to general relativity have been proposed to solve a host of cosmological and astrophysical problems. Many modified gravity models are now ruled out with further astrophysical observations; some theories are still viable, with, at best, bounds on their parameters set by observations to date. More recently, observations of Fast Radio Bursts have proven to be remarkably powerful tools to constrain cosmology and fundamental physics. In this work, we consider a generic modified gravity theory and consider the implications for gravitational lensing with Fast Radio Bursts. We use a set of Fast Radio Burst observations to constrain the fraction of dark matter made up of primordial black holes in such a theory. We further show that modified gravity adds a screening effect on gravitational lensing similar to the case when there is plasma in the path of the light ray acting as a scattering screen.

2023-08-31, **Instantaneous Symmetry Breaking to the Non-observed Dark Matter**, Yaquan Fang et.al., [2308.16412v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16412v1)

 A theory explaining the non-observation of the dark matter and the source of the dark energy is presented in this letter. By integrating the asymmetrical potential and the Higgs potential, we provide a model with instantaneous symmetrical breaking and stable symmetrical breaking, resulting in the non-observed dark matter and observed matter respectively. Two crucial parameters in this model are the frequency and strength of the symmetry breaking from the vacuum: the former helps explain the impact of the effective mass from the dark matter; the latter determines the source of the dark energy. The expected strength in a certain period varies, causing the accelerating or deccelerating expansions of the universe. Considering the expected strength correlated with the vacuum expectation value and basing on the possible variations of the measured masses of the fundamental particles such as Z boson over time, one can perhaps derive the exact stage of the current universe.

2023-08-31, **Dark phase transition from WIMP: complementary tests from gravitational waves and colliders**, Shinya Kanemura et.al., [2308.16390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16390v1)

 A dark sector is an interesting place where a strong first-order phase transition, observable gravitational waves and/or a dark matter candidate could arise. However, the experimental tests for such a dark sector could be ambiguous due to the dark content, largely unconstrained parameter space and the connection to the visible world. We consider a minimal dark scalar-vector boson plasma to realize the three mentioned phenomena, with a unique connection to the Standard Model via the Higgs portal coupling. We discuss the important features of the Higgs portal in such a minimal dark sector, namely the dark thermalization, collider tests, and direct detection of dark matter. We perform numerical analyses of the dark phase transition associated with stochastic gravitational waves and dark matter, discussing the complementarity of collider detection, dark matter direct detection and space-based/terrestrial interferometers as a promising avenue to hear and see the minimal dark sector.

2023-08-30, **The abundance of core--collapsed subhalos in SIDM: insights from structure formation in $Λ$CDM**, Neev Shah et.al., [2308.16342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16342v1)

 Dark matter halos can enter a phase of gravothermal core--collapse in the presence of self-interactions. This phase that follows a core--expansion phase is thought to be subdominant due to the long time-scales involved. However, it has been shown that the collapse can be accelerated in tidal environments particularly for halos that are centrally concentrated. Cosmological simulations in $\Lambda$CDM give us the full distribution of satellite orbits and halo profiles in the universe. We use properties of the orbits and profiles of subhalos from simulations to estimate the fraction of the subhalos in different host halo environments, ranging from the Large Magellanic cloud(LMC)--like hosts to clusters, that are in the core--collapse phase. We use fluid simulations of self--interacting dark matter (SIDM) to evolve subhalos in their hosts including the effect of tidal truncation at the time of their pericenter crossing. We find that for parameters that allow the interaction cross-section to be high at dwarf scales, at least $10~\%$ of all subhalos are expected to have intrinsically collapsed within Hubble time up to the group mass host scales. This fraction increases significantly, becoming at least 20$\%$ when tidal interactions are considered. To identify these objects we find that we either need to measure their densities at very small radial scales, where the subhalos show a bimodal distribution of densities, or alternatively we need to measure the slopes of their inner density profiles near the scale radius, which are much steeper than NFW slopes expected in cold dark matter halos. Current measurements of central slopes of classical dwarfs do not show a preference for collapsed objects, however this is consistent with an SIDM scenario where the classical dwarfs are expected to be in a cored phase.

2023-08-30, **Figure Rotation of IllustrisTNG Halos**, Neil Ash et.al., [2308.16253v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16253v1)

 We use the TNG50 and TNG50 dark matter (DM)-only simulations from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to conduct an updated survey of halo figure rotation in the presence of baryons. We develop a novel methodology to detect coherent figure rotation about an arbitrary axis and for arbitrary durations and apply it to a catalog of 1,577 DM halos from the DM-only run and 1,396 DM halos from the DM+baryons (DM+B) run that are free of major mergers. Figure rotation was detected in $94\%$ of DM-only halos and $82\%$ of the DM+B halos. The pattern speeds of rotations lasting $\gtrsim 1h^{-1}$ Gyr were log-normally distributed with medians of $0.25~h$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ for DM-only in agreement with past results, but $14\%$ higher at $0.29~h$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ in the DM+B halos. We find that rotation axes are typically aligned with the halo minor or major axis, in $57\%$ of DM-only halos and in $62\%$ of DM+B halos. The remaining rotation axes were not strongly aligned with any principal axis but typically lay in the plane containing the halo minor and major axes. Longer-lived rotations showed greater alignment with the halo minor axis in both simulations. Our results show that in the presence of baryons, figure rotation is marginally less common, shorter-lived, faster, and better aligned with the minor axis than in DM-only halos. This updated understanding will be consequential for future efforts to constrain figure rotation in the Milky Way dark halo using the morphology and kinematics of tidal streams.

2023-08-30, **Multi-component Dark Matter and Small Scale Structure Formation**, Robert Wiley Deal et.al., [2308.16242v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16242v1)

 We consider the evolution of non-thermal dark matter perturbations in models which contain both Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions. Using constraints from existing observations we examine the percentage of WIMPs and axions that may comprise the cosmological dark matter budget in models with an Early Matter Dominated Epoch (EMDE) -- where entropy production is important. After carefully tracking the thermal evolution of the various species by solving the Boltzmann equations, we consider the enhancement of perturbations that may have led to early structure formation for axions and WIMPs. We investigate the impact of enhanced perturbations on the parameter space of both species, after imposing existing constraints from indirect detection experiments. Given these constraints we establish the feasibility of axions to form miniclusters in the early universe in EMDEs for a given percentage of allowed WIMPs. We find that EMDEs with low reheat temperatures near the BBN limit are preferred for axion minicluster formation. When the EMDE is caused by string moduli, the WIMP contribution to the relic density is set by the moduli branching to dark matter at the level of $\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$.

2023-08-30, **Forbidden conformal dark matter at a GeV**, Steven Ferrante et.al., [2308.16219v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16219v1)

 We introduce a model of dark matter (DM) where the DM is a composite of a spontaneously broken conformal field theory. The DM is a thermal relic with its abundance determined by the freeze-out of annihilations to dilatons, the Goldstone boson of broken conformal symmetry. If the dilaton is heavier than the DM this is an example of forbidden DM. We explore the phenomenology of this model in its 5D dual description, corresponding to a warped extra dimension with the Standard Model on the ultraviolet brane and the DM on the infrared brane. We find the model is compatible with theoretical and experimental constraints for DM masses in the $0.1$-$10$ GeV range. The conformal phase transition is supercooled and strongly first-order. It can source large stochastic gravitational wave signals consistent with those recently observed at pulsar timing arrays like NANOGrav. The majority of the viable parameter space will be probed by future detectors designed to search for long-lived particles, including most of the region favored by the NANOGrav signal. The rest of the parameter space can be probed at future direct detection experiments.

2023-08-30, **On the oscillating electric dipole moment induced by axion-fermion couplings**, Luca Di Luzio et.al., [2308.16135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16135v1)

 It has been recently claimed that the axion coupling to fermions is responsible for an oscillating electric dipole moment (EDM) in the background of axion dark matter. In this work, we re-examine the derivation of this effect. Contrary to previous studies, we point out the physical relevance of an axion boundary term, which is crucial in restoring the axion shift symmetry and drastically affects the EDM phenomenology. To describe the latter, we introduce the notion of a time-integrated effective axion EDM, which encodes the boundary term and whose magnitude depends on the oscillating regime. For slow oscillations the boundary term washes out the standard oscillating EDM, resulting in an exact cancellation in the static limit. Conversely, during fast oscillations, the boundary term amplifies the effective EDM. This new observable is especially interesting in the case of the electron EDM. Remarkably, for an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ axion-electron coupling, the overall size of the effective EDM in the intermediate oscillations regime is comparable to the present static EDM limit.

2023-08-30, **Circumgalactic Ly$α$ emission around submillimeter-bright galaxies with different quasar contributions**, Vale González Lobos et.al., [2308.15955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15955v1)

 We present VLT/MUSE observations targeting the extended Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission of five high-redshift ($z\sim$3-4) submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) with increasing quasar (QSO) radiation: two SMGs, two SMGs hosting a QSO, and one SMG hosting a QSO with a SMG companion (QSO+SMG). These sources should be located in dark matter halos of comparable masses (average mass of $M\_{\rm DM}\sim10^{12.2}\,{\rm M}\_\odot$). We quantify the luminosity and extent of the Ly$\alpha$ emission, together with its kinematics, and examine four Ly$\alpha$ powering mechanisms: photoionization from QSOs/star formation, shocks by galactic/QSO outflows, gravitational cooling radiation, and Ly$\alpha$ photons resonant scattering. We find a variety of Ly$\alpha$ luminosities and extents, with the QSO+SMG system displaying the most extended and bright nebula, followed by the SMGs hosting a QSO, and finally the undetected circumgalactic medium (CGM) of SMGs. This diversity implies that gravitational cooling is unlikely to be the main powering mechanism. We show that photoionization from the QSO and QSO outflows can contribute to power the emission for average densities $n\_{\rm H}>0.5\,$cm$^{-3}$. Moreover, the observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosities scale with the QSO's budget of Ly$\alpha$ photons modulo the dust content in each galaxy, highlighting a possible contribution from resonant scattering of QSO's radiation in powering the nebulae. We find larger Ly$\alpha$ linewidths (FWHM$\gtrsim 1200\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$) than usually reported around radio-quiet systems, pointing to large-scale outflows. A statistical survey targeting similar high-redshift massive systems with known host properties is needed to confirm our findings.

2023-08-30, **Dynamics of Dwarf Galaxies in Scalar-Tensor-Vector-Gravity**, Ivan De Martino et.al., [2308.15908v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15908v1)

 We have investigated whether the Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity theory (STVG) may explain the kinematic of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. STVG modifies General Relativity by adding extra scalar and vector fields with the main aim of replacing dark matter in astrophysical self-gravitating systems. The weak-field limit of STVG brings a Yukawa-like modification to the Newtonian gravitational potential. The modification is modulated by two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\mu$, that represent a redefinition of the gravitational coupling constant and the mass of the additional vector fields, respectively. Thus, adopting the modified gravitational potential arising in the weak-field limit of STVG, we have solved the spherical Jeans equation to predict the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles of eight dwarf spheroidal galaxies orbiting around the Milky Way. The predicted profiles are then compared to the data using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm. Our results pointed out some tensions on the $\alpha$ parameter within the data set, while comparison with previous analysis shows the effectiveness of STVG in replacing dark matter with extra massive fields. Further improvements will require more sophisticated modelling of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion which will be possible as soon as high-precision astrometric data in dwarf spheroidals will become available.

 The majority of baryons, which account for $15\%$ of the matter in the Universe, will end their lives as carbon and oxygen inside cold black dwarfs. Dark matter (DM) makes up the remaining $85\%$ of the matter in the universe, however, the fate of DM is unknown. Here we show that the destiny of purely gravitationally interacting DM particles follows one of two possible routes. The first possible route, the "radiation-destiny" scenario, is that massive DM particles lose sufficient energy through gravitational radiation causing them to spiral into a supermassive black hole that ultimately disappears through Hawking radiation. The second possible route, the "drifting-alone" destiny, applies to lighter DM particles, where only the central DM halo region spirals into the central BH which is then Hawking radiated away. The rest of the DM halo is ripped apart by the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

 We investigate the effect of dark matter spikes on the ringdown waveforms and shadows of the supermassive black holes at the core of the Milky Way and M87. The dominant effect comes in the form of a redshift factor due to the mass of the spike and is significant for large supermassive black holes such as M87*. The subdominant contributions, recently calculated in {\it ApJ} {\bf 940} 33 (2022), give information about the distribution of matter in the spike. We show that these subdominant contributions are small as compared to the redshift factor and likely difficult to detect except perhaps for very large black holes. We also show that the effect of a dark matter spike, with density near the observational upper bounds, on the shadow radius of M87* is only an order of magnitude smaller than is currently accessible with Event Horizon Telescope data.

 Holmberg II - a dwarf galaxy in the nearby M81 group - is a very informative source of distribution of gas and dust in the interstellar discs. High-resolution observations in the infrared (IR) allows us to distinguish isolated star-forming regions, photodissociation (PDR) and HII regions, remnants of supernovae (SNe) explosions and, as such, can provide information about more relevant physical processes. In this paper we analyse dust emission in the wavelength range 4.5 to 160 micron using the data from IR space observatories at 27 different locations across the galaxy. We observe that the derived spectra can be represented by multiple dust populations with different temperatures, which are found to be independent of their locations in the galaxy. By comparing the dust temperatures with the far ultraviolet (FUV) intensities observed by the UVIT instrument onboard AstroSat, we find that for locations showing a 100 micron peak, the temperature of cold (20 to 30 K) dust grains show a dependence on the FUV intensities, while such dependence is not observed for the other locations. We believe that the approach described here can be a good tool in revealing different dust populations in other nearby galaxies with available high spatial resolution data.

2023-08-31, **The MPIfR-MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey II. The eccentric double neutron star system PSR J1208-5936 and a neutron star merger rate update**, M. Colom i Bernadich et.al., [2308.16802v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16802v1)

 The MMGPS-L is the most sensitive pulsar survey in the Southern Hemisphere. We present a follow-up study of one of these new discoveries, PSR J1208-5936, a 28.71-ms recycled pulsar in a double neutron star system with an orbital period of Pb=0.632 days and an eccentricity of e=0.348. Through timing of almost one year of observations, we detected the relativistic advance of periastron (0.918(1) deg/yr), resulting in a total system mass of Mt=2.586(5) Mo. We also achieved low-significance constraints on the amplitude of the Einstein delay and Shapiro delay, in turn yielding constraints on the pulsar mass (Mp=1.26(+0.13/-0.25) Mo), the companion mass (Mc=1.32(+0.25/-0.13) Mo, and the inclination angle (i=57(2) degrees). This system is highly eccentric compared to other Galactic field double neutron stars with similar periods, possibly hinting at a larger-than-usual supernova kick during the formation of the second-born neutron star. The binary will merge within 7.2(2) Gyr due to the emission of gravitational waves. With the improved sensitivity of the MMGPS-L, we updated the Milky Way neutron star merger rate to be 25(+19/-9) Myr$^{-1}$ within 90% credible intervals, which is lower than previous studies based on known Galactic binaries owing to the lack of further detections despite the highly sensitive nature of the survey. This implies a local cosmic neutron star merger rate of 293(+222/-103} Gpc/yr, consistent with LIGO and Virgo O3 observations. With this, we predict the observation of 10(+8/-4) neutron star merger events during the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4 run. We predict the uncertainties on the component masses and the inclination angle will be reduced to 5x10$^{-3}$ Mo and 0.4 degrees after two decades of timing, and that in at least a decade from now the detection of the shift in Pb and the sky proper motion will serve to make an independent constraint of the distance to the system.

2023-08-31, **Exploring the Polarization of Axially Symmetric Supernovae with Unsupervised Deep Learning**, J. R. Maund et.al., [2308.16686v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16686v1)

 The measurement of non-zero polarization can be used to infer the presence of departures from spherical symmetry in supernovae (SNe). The origin of the majority of the intrinsic polarization observed in SNe is in electron scattering, which induces a wavelength-independent continuum polarization that is generally observed to be low (<1%) for all SN types. The key indicator of asymmetry in SNe is the polarization observed across spectral lines, in particular the characteristic ``inverse P Cygni'' profile. The results of a suite of 900 Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations are presented here. These simulations cover a range of possible axisymmetric structures (including unipolar, bipolar and equatorial enhancements) for the line forming region of the Ca II infrared triplet. Using a Variational Autoencoder, 7 key latent parameters are learned that describe the relationship between Stokes I and Stokes q, under the assumption of an axially symmetric line forming region and resonant scattering. Likelihood-free inference techniques are used to invert the Stokes I and q line profiles, in the latent space, to derive the underlying geometries. For axially symmetric structures, that yield an observable ``dominant axis'' on the Stokes $q-u$ plane, we propose the existence of a geometry ``conjugate" (which is indistinguishable under a rotation of $\pi /2$). Using this machine learning infrastructure, we attempt to identify possible geometries associated with spectropolarimetric observations of the Type Ib SN 2017gax.

2023-08-31, **The Orion-Taurus ridge: a synchrotron radio loop at the edge of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble**, Andrea Bracco et.al., [2308.16663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16663v1)

 Large-scale synchrotron loops are recognized as the main source of diffuse radio-continuum emission in the Galaxy at intermediate and high Galactic latitudes. Their origin, however, remains rather unexplained. Using a combination of multi-frequency data in the radio band of total and polarized intensities, for the first time in this letter, we associate one arc -- hereafter, the Orion-Taurus ridge -- with the wall of the most prominent stellar-feedback blown shell in the Solar neighborhood, namely the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. We traced the Orion-Taurus ridge using 3D maps of interstellar dust extinction and column-density maps of molecular gas, $N\_{\rm H\_2}$. We found the Orion-Taurus ridge at a distance of 400\,pc, with a plane-of-the-sky extent of $180$\,pc. Its median $N\_{\rm H\_2}$ value is $(1.4^{+2.6}\_{-0.6})\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. Thanks to the broadband observations below 100 MHz of the Long Wavelength Array, we also computed the low-frequency spectral-index map of synchrotron emissivity, $\beta$, in the Orion-Taurus ridge. We found a flat distribution of $\beta$ with a median value of $-2.24^{+0.03}\_{-0.02}$ that we interpreted in terms of depletion of low-energy ($<$ GeV) cosmic-ray electrons in recent supernova remnants ($10^5$ - $10^6$ yrs). Our results are consistent with plane-of-the-sky magnetic-field strengths in the Orion-Taurus ridge larger than a few tens of $\mu$G ($> 30 - 40 \,\mu$G). We report the first detection of diffuse synchrotron emission from cold-neutral, partly molecular, gas in the surroundings of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. This observation opens a new perspective to study the multiphase and magnetized interstellar medium with the advent of future high-sensitivity radio facilities, such as the C-Band All-Sky Survey and the Square Kilometre Array.

2023-08-30, **The Scientific Performance of the MoonBurst Energetics All-sky Monitor(MoonBEAM)**, C. Fletcher et.al., [2308.16293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16293v1)

 MoonBEAM is a SmallSat concept placed in cislunar orbit developed to study the progenitors and multimessenger/multiwavelength signals of transient relativistic jets and outflows and determine the conditions that lead to the launching of a transient relativistic jet. The advantage of MoonBEAM is the instantaneous all-sky coverage due to its orbit, which maximizes the gamma-raytransient observations and provides upperlimits for non-detections. Earth blockage and detector downtime from the high particle activity in the South Atlantic Anomaly region prevent gamma-ray observatories in low Earth orbit from surveying the entire sky at a given time. In addition, the long baseline provided from a cislunar orbit allows MoonBEAM to constrain the localization annulus when combined with a gamma-ray instrument in low Earth orbit utilizing the timing triangulation technique. We present the scientific performance of MoonBEAM including the expected effective area, localization ability and duty cycle. MoonBEAM provides many advantages to the gamma-ray and gravitational-wave follow up community by reducing the search region needed to identify the afterglow and kilanova emission. In addition, the all-sky coverage will provide insight into the conditions that lead to a successful relativistic jet, instead of a shock breakout event, or a completely failed jet in the case of core collapse supernovae.

2023-08-30, **Late Time Modification of Structure Growth and the S8 Tension**, Meng-Xiang Lin et.al., [2308.16183v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16183v1)

 The $S\_8$ tension between low-redshift galaxy surveys and the primary CMB signals a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Recently differing results have been obtained using low-redshift galaxy surveys and the higher redshifts probed by CMB lensing, motivating a possible time-dependent modification to the growth of structure. We investigate a simple phenomenological model in which the growth of structure deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction at late times, in particular as a simple function of the dark energy density. Fitting to galaxy lensing, CMB lensing, BAO, and Supernovae datasets, we find significant evidence - 2.5 - 3$\sigma$, depending on analysis choices - for a non-zero value of the parameter quantifying a deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. The preferred model, which has a slower growth of structure below $z\sim 1$, improves the joint fit to the data over $\Lambda$CDM. While the overall fit is improved, there is weak evidence for galaxy and CMB lensing favoring different changes in the growth of structure.

2023-08-30, **The dawn is quiet here: Rise in [$α$/Fe] is a signature of massive gas accretion that fueled proto-Milky Way**, Boquan Chen et.al., [2308.15976v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15976v1)

 The proto-Milky Way epoch forms the earliest stars in our Galaxy and sets the initial conditions for subsequent disk formation. Recent observations from APOGEE and H3 surveys showed that the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio slowly declined between [Fe/H] $=-3$ and $-1.3$ until it reached the lowest value ($\sim 0.25$) among the selected in situ metal-poor stars that most likely formed during the proto-Galaxy epoch. [$\alpha$/Fe] rose to meet the traditional high value commonly associated with the thick disk population at [Fe/H] $=-1$. It was suggested that the rise in [$\alpha$/Fe] could be caused by an increase in the star formation efficiency (SFE), known as the "simmering" phase scenario. However, gas inflow also plays a vital role in shaping the star formation history and chemical evolution of galaxies. We investigate this unexpected [$\alpha$/Fe]-rise with a statistical experiment involving a galactic chemical evolution (GCE). Our model has five free parameters: the mass of the initial reservoir of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) at birth, the frequency of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the cooling timescale of the warm ISM, the SFE, and the inflow rate of fresh gas. The last two free parameters were allowed to change after [$\alpha$/Fe] reached its lowest value, dividing the proto-Galaxy epoch into two phases. We find that the rise in [$\alpha$/Fe] is caused by a large inflow of fresh gas and conclude that the [$\alpha$/Fe]-rise is a signature of the cold mode accretion whose materials formed the prototype Milky Way preceding disk formation. Although the SFE is essential in regulating the chemical evolution, it does not necessarily increase to facilitate the [$\alpha$/Fe]-rise.

2023-08-30, **Jitter radiation as an alternative mechanism for the nonthermal X-ray emission of Cassiopeia A**, Emanuele Greco et.al., [2308.15956v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15956v1)

 Synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons is usually invoked as the responsible for the nonthermal emission observed in Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is the most popular mechanism to explain the process of particles acceleration and within its framework a crucial role is played by the turbulent magnetic-field. However, the standard models commonly used to fit X-ray synchrotron emission do not take into account the effects of turbulence in the shape of the resulting photon spectra. An alternative mechanism that properly includes such effects is the jitter radiation, that provides for an additional power-law beyond the classical synchrotron cutoff. We fitted a jitter spectral model to Chandra, NuSTAR, SWIFT/BAT and INTEGRAL/ISGRI spectra of Cassiopeia A and found that it describes the X-ray soft-to-hard range better than any of the standard cutoff models. The jitter radiation allows us to measure the index of the magnetic turbulence spectrum $\nu\_B$ and the minimum scale of the turbulence $\lambda\_{\rm{min}}$ across several regions of Cas A, with best-fit values $\nu\_B \sim 2-2.4$ and $\lambda\_{\rm{min}} \lesssim 100$ km.

2023-08-30, **Metal Enrichment due to Embedded Stars in AGN Discs**, Jiamu Huang et.al., [2308.15761v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15761v1)

 We separately assess elemental abundances in AGNs' broad and narrow emission line regions (BLR and NLR), based on a critical assessment of published results together with new photoionization models. We find 1) He/H enhancements in some AGN, exceeding what can be explained by normal chemical evolution and confirm 2) super-solar {\alpha} abundance, though to a lesser degree than previously reported. We also reaffirm 3) a N/O ratio consistent with secondary production; 4) solar or slightly sub-solar Fe abundance; and 5) red-shift independent metallicity, in contrast with galactic chemical evolution. We interpret 6) the larger metallicity in the BLR than NRL in terms of an in situ stellar evolution and pollution in AGN discs (SEPAD) model. We attribute: a) the redshift independence to the heavy element pollutants being disposed into the disc and accreted onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH); b) the limited He excess to the accretion-wind metabolism of a top-heavy population of evolving massive main sequence stars; c) the super-solar CNO enrichment to the nuclear synthesis during their post-main-sequence evolution; d) the large N/O to the byproduct of multiple stellar generations; and e) the Mg, Si, and Fe to the ejecta of type II supernovae in the disc. These results provide supporting evidence for f) ongoing self-regulated star formation, g) adequate stellar luminosity to maintain marginal gravitational stability, h) prolific production of seeds and i) dense coexistence of subsequently-grown residual black hole populations in AGN discs.

2023-08-30, **Measurements of the Hubble constant from combinations of supernovae and radio quasars**, Tonghua Liu et.al., [2308.15731v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15731v1)

 In this letter, we propose an improved cosmological model independent method of determining the value of the Hubble constant $H\_0$. The method uses unanchored luminosity distances $H\_0d\_L(z)$ from SN Ia Pantheon data combined with angular diameter distances $d\_A(z)$ from a sample of intermediate luminosity radio quasars calibrated as standard rulers. The distance duality relation between $d\_L(z)$ and $d\_A(z)$, which is robust and independent of any cosmological model, allows to disentangle $H\_0$ from such combination. However, the number of redshift matched quasars and SN Ia pairs is small (37 data-points). Hence, we take an advantage from the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method to recover the $d\_A(z)$ relation from a network trained on full 120 radio quasar sample. In this case, the result is unambiguously consistent with values of $H\_0$ obtained from local probes by SH0ES and H0LiCOW collaborations. Three statistical summary measures: weighted mean $\widetilde{H}\_0=73.51(\pm0.67) {~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, median $Med(H\_0)=74.71(\pm4.08) {~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ and MCMC simulated posterior distribution $H\_0=73.52^{+0.66}\_{-0.68} {~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ are fully consistent with each other and the precision reached $1\%$ level. This is encouraging for the future applications of our method. Because individual measurements of $H\_0$ are related to different redshifts spanning the range $z=0.5 - 2.0$, we take advantage of this fact to check if there is any noticeable trend in $H\_0$ measurements with redshift of objects used for this purpose. However, our result is that the data we used strongly support the lack of such systematic effects.
