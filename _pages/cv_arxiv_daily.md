2023-08-21, **The UHECR-FR0 Radio Galaxy Connection: A Multi-Messenger Study of Energy Spectra/Composition Emission and Intergalactic Magnetic Field Propagation**, J. P. Lundquist et.al., [2308.10803v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10803v1)

 This study investigates low luminosity Fanaroff-Riley Type 0 (FR0) radio galaxies as a potentially significant source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Due to their much higher prevalence in the local universe compared to more powerful radio galaxies (about five times more than FR-1s), FR0s may provide a substantial fraction of the total UHECR energy density. To determine the nucleon composition and energy spectrum of UHECRs emitted by FR0 sources, simulation results from CRPropa3 are fit to Pierre Auger Observatory data. The resulting emission spectral indices, rigidity cutoffs, and nucleon fractions are compared to recent Auger results. The FR0 simulations include the approximately isotropic distribution of FR0 galaxies and various intergalactic magnetic field configurations (including random and structured fields) and predict the fluxes of secondary photons and neutrinos produced during UHECR propagation through cosmic photon backgrounds. This comprehensive simulation allows for investigating the properties of the FR0 sources using observational multi-messenger data.

2023-08-21, **Study of Scalar Non Standard Interaction at Protvino to Super-ORCA experiment**, Dinesh Kumar Singha et.al., [2308.10789v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10789v1)

 In this paper we have studied the phenomenon of non-standard interaction mediated by a scalar field (SNSI) in the context of P2SO experiment and compared its sensitivity with DUNE. In particular, we have studied the capability of these two experiments to put bounds on the diagonal SNSI parameters i.e., $\eta\_{ee}$, $\eta\_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta\_{\tau\tau}$ and studied the impact of these parameters on the determination of neutrino mass ordering, octant of $\theta\_{23}$ and CP violation (CPV). In our analysis we find that, the parameter $\Delta m^2\_{31}$ has a non-trivial role if one wants estimate the bounds on $\eta\_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta\_{\tau\tau}$ assuming SNSI does not exist in nature. Our results show that sensitivity of P2SO and DUNE to constraint $\eta\_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta\_{\tau\tau}$ are similar whereas the sensitivity of DUNE is slightly better for $\eta\_{ee}$. We find that the mass ordering and CPV sensitivities are mostly affected by $\eta\_{ee}$ compared to $\eta\_{\mu \mu}$ and $\eta\_{\tau \tau}$ if one assumes SNSI exists in nature. On the other hand, octant sensitivity is mostly affected by $\eta\_{\mu \mu}$ and $\eta\_{\tau \tau}$. These sensitivities can be either higher or lower than the standard three flavour scenario depending on the relative sign of the SNSI parameters. Regarding the precision of atmospheric mixing parameters, we find that the precision of $\theta\_{23}$ deteriorates significantly in the presence of $\eta\_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta\_{\tau\tau}$.

2023-08-20, **Search for a leptophobic doubly charged Higgs in same-sign four-lepton and six-lepton signatures in a left-right symmetric model**, Tathagata Ghosh et.al., [2308.10314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10314v1)

 We investigate the possibility of multi-lepton (four and six) signatures, including an exotic signature of same-sign four-lepton (SS4L) as signals of pair production of a doubly charged Higgs in the minimal left-right symmetric model, extended with two doublet scalars. The right-handed neutrino masses are generated in this model through a dimension-$5$ lepton-number violating operator allowing the triplet scalar interactions with leptons to become negligibly small. This leads to interesting six-lepton and SS4L signatures that can be observed at the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) with almost no background for doubly charged Higgs with mass below 500 GeV.

2023-08-21, **From RATs to riches: mitigating anthropogenic and synanthropic noise in atom interferometer searches for ultra-light dark matter**, John Carlton et.al., [2308.10731v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10731v1)

 Atom interferometers offer promising new avenues for detecting ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). The exceptional sensitivity of atom interferometers to fluctuations in the local gravitational potential exposes them to sources of noise from human (anthropogenic) and animal (synanthropic) activity, which may obscure signals from ULDM. We characterise potential anthropogenic and synanthropic noise sources and examine their influence on a year-long measurement campaign by AION-10, an upcoming atom interferometer experiment that will be located at the University of Oxford. We propose a data cleaning framework that identifies and then masks anthropogenic and synanthropic noise. With this framework, we demonstrate that even in noisy conditions, the sensitivity to ULDM can be restored to within between 10% and 40% of an atom shot noise-limited experiment, depending on the specific composition of the anthropogenic and synanthropic noise. This work provides an important step towards creating robust noise reduction analysis strategies in the pursuit of ULDM detection with atom interferometers.

2023-08-21, **Logarithmic divergent friction on ultrarelativistic bubble walls**, Wen-Yuan Ai et.al., [2308.10679v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10679v1)

 We calculate the friction experienced by ultrarelativistic bubble walls resulting from the $1 \rightarrow 2$ light-to-heavy transition process, with finite-wall-width effects fully taken into account. In this process, the light particle is excited from the order-parameter scalar field, while the two heavy particles are excitations of a dark matter scalar field. Unlike earlier estimates suggesting a friction scaling as $\gamma\_w^0$, where $\gamma\_w$ represents the Lorentz factor of the wall velocity, our more precise numerical analysis reveals a logarithmic dependence of the friction on $\gamma\_w$. We offer a numerical fit to capture this frictional pressure accurately. Our analysis verifies that the friction stemming from the $1 \rightarrow 2$ light-to-heavy transition is typically much smaller than the friction from the $1 \rightarrow 1$ transmission of the dark matter particles.

2023-08-21, **Anisotropies, large and small**, Teresa Bister et.al., [2308.10678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10678v1)

 We report on several new results using anisotropies of UHECRs. We improve and extend the work of Ding, Globus and Farrar, who modeled the UHECR dipole assuming sources follow the dark matter distribution, accounting for deflections in the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields but using a simplified treatment of interactions during propagation. The work presented here employs an accurate and self-consistent treatment of the evolution of composition during propagation, allows for and explores the impact of "bias" in the relation between UHECR sources and the dark matter distribution, and investigates the possible generation of arrival-direction-dependent composition anisotropies. Limits on the source number density consistent with the observed anisotropies are derived for the case where UHECR sources follow the dark matter distribution, and compared to a homogeneous source distribution case.

2023-08-21, **Persistent homology of collider observations: when (w)hole matters**, Jyotiranjan Beuria et.al., [2308.10588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10588v1)

 Topological invariants have played a fundamental role in the advancement of theoretical high energy physics. Physicists have used several kinematic techniques to distinguish new physics predictions from the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics at Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, the study of global topological invariants of the collider signals has not yet attracted much attention. In this article, we present, a novel approach to study collider signals using persistent homology. The global topological properties of the ensemble of events as expressed by measures like persistent entropy, Betti area, etc. are worth considering in addition to the traditional approach of using kinematic variables event by event. In this exploratory study, we first explore the characteristic topological signature of a few SM electroweak resonant productions. Next, we use the framework to distinguish global properties of the invisible Higgs decay processes in the SM and a real singlet extension of the SM featuring stable singlet scalar dark matter.

2023-08-21, **Preliminary Exploration of Areal Density of Angular Momentum for Spiral Galaxies**, Lan Zhang et.al., [2308.10519v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10519v1)

 The specific angular momenta ($j\_t$) of stars, baryons as a whole and dark matter haloes contain clues of vital importance about how galaxies form and evolve. Using a sample of 70 spiral galaxies, we perform a preliminary analysis of $j\_t$, and introduce a new quantity, e.g., areal density of angular momentum (ADAM) ($j\_t~M\_\star/4R\_d^2$) as an indication for the existence of jet in spiral galaxies. The percentage of spiral galaxies having jet(s) shows strong correlation with the ADAM, although the present sample is incomplete.

2023-08-21, **Conformal theory of gravitation and cosmic expansion**, R. K. Nesbet et.al., [2308.10399v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10399v1)

 The postulate of universal Weyl conformal symmetry for all elementary physical fields introduces nonclassical gravitational effects in both conformal gravitation(CG) and the conformal Higgs model (CHM). The resulting theory is found to explain major observed phenomena including excessive galactic rotation velocities and accelerating Hubble expansion, without invoking dark matter (DM). The recent history of this development is surveyed here. Implications of the theory include galactic baryonic Tully-Fisher relations and dark galactic haloes of definite large radius. Cosmological CHM parameters exclude a massive Higgs boson but are consistent with a novel alternative particle of the observed mass.

2023-08-20, **Comparing measurements and limits on the warm dark matter temperature-to-mass ratio**, Bruce Hoeneisen et.al., [2308.10356v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10356v1)

 Limits on the "thermal relic" warm dark matter mass are apparently inconsistent with measurements of the warm dark matter temperature-to-mass ratio. We try to understand this problem.

2023-08-21, **Simulating Hydrogen-poor Interaction-Powered Supernovae with CHIPS**, Yuki Takei et.al., [2308.10785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10785v1)

 We present the updated open-source code Complete History of Interaction-Powered Supernovae (CHIPS) that can be applied to modeling supernovae (SNe) arising from an interaction with massive circumstellar medium (CSM) as well as the formation process of the CSM. Our update mainly concerns with extensions to hydrogen-poor SNe from stripped progenitors, targeting modeling of interaction-powered SNe Ibc such as Type Ibn and Icn SNe. We successfully reproduce the basic properties of the light curves of these types of SNe that occur after partial eruption of the outermost layer with a mass of $0.01$--$0.1\,M\_\odot$ at $\lesssim 1$ year before explosion. We also find that the luminosity of the observed precursors can be naturally explained by the outburst that creates the dense CSM, given that the energy of the outburst is efficiently dissipated by collision with an external material, possibly generated by a previous mass eruption. We discuss possible scenarios causing eruptive mass-loss based on our results.

2023-08-21, **Evolution of double oxygen-neon white dwarf merger remnant**, Chengyuan Wu et.al., [2308.10695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10695v1)

 Double white dwarf (WD) merger process and their post-merger evolution are important in many fields of astronomy, such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, gravitational waves, etc. The evolutionary outcomes of double ultra-massive WD merger remnants are still a subject of debate, though the general consensus is that the merger remnant will collapse to form a neutron star. In this work, we investigate the evolution of a 2.20Msun merger remnant stemmed from the coalescence of double 1.10Msun ONe WDs. We find that the remnant ignites off-centre neon burning at the position near the surface of primary WD soon after the merger, resulting in the stable inwardly propagating oxygen/neon (O/Ne) flame. The final outcomes of the merger remnant are sensitive to the effect of convective boundary mixing. If the mixing cannot stall the O/Ne flame, the flame will reach the centre within 20 years, leading to the formation of super Chandrasekhar mass silicon core, and its final fate probably be neutron star (NS) through iron-core-collapse supernova. In contrast, if the convective mixing is effective enough to prevent the O/Ne flame from reaching the centre, the merger remnant will undergo electron capture supernova to form an ONeFe WD. Meanwhile, we find that the wind mass loss process may hardly alter the final fate of the remnant due to its fast evolution. Our results imply that the coalescence of double ONe WDs can form short lived giant like object, but the final outcomes (NS or ONeFe WD) are influenced by the uncertain convective mixing in O/Ne flame.
