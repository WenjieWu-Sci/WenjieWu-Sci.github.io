2024-04-09, **Constraining electron number density in the Sun via Earth-based neutrino flavor data**, Caroline Laber-Smith et.al., [2404.06468v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06468v1)

 Neutrino flavor transformation offers a window into the physics of various astrophysical environments, including our Sun and the more exotic environs of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. Here, we apply an inference framework - specifically: statistical data assimilation (SDA) - to neutrino flavor evolution in the Sun. We take a model for solar neutrino flavor evolution, together with Earth-based neutrino measurements, to infer solar properties. Specifically, we ask what signature of the radially-varying solar electron number density $n\_e(r)$ is contained within these Earth-based measurements. Currently, the best estimates of $n\_e(r)$ come from the standard solar model. We seek to ascertain, through novel application of the SDA method, whether estimates of the same from neutrino data can serve as independent constraints.

 Sterile neutrinos as source of the mass and flavor mixing of active neutrinos as well as genesis of the dark matter (DM) and matter-antimatter asymmetry have gained special interest. Here we study the case of the Standard Model (SM) extended with three right-handed (RH) neutrinos and a dark sector with two extra sterile neutrinos, odd under a discrete $Z\_2$ symmetry. The RH neutrinos are responsible for producing the baryon asymmetry via the high-scale unflavored leptogenesis. They are superheavy and their abundance at the electroweak broken stage is vanishingly small, so that they have no impact on the phenomenology at low energies. The two dark neutrinos generate the tiny mass of two active neutrinos through a mechanism similar to the minimal linear seesaw, and saturate the relic abundance as freeze-in DM via decay of the heavy SM bosons. The absence of the dark Majorana mass terms in the dark linear seesaw is explained by invoking a hidden symmetry, the so-called presymmetry, and the DM candidate appears in the form of a quasi-Dirac neutrino. The $Z\_2$ symmetry is broken in the dark neutrino sector, but exact in the realm of RH neutrinos. The required coupling weakness for the freeze-in DM neutrino is related to a very small breach of unitarity in the active neutrino mixing matrix. We show how phenomenological constraints on the production and decay of the DM neutrino imply an upper bound around 1 MeV for its mass and unitarity up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ for the mixing matrix.

2024-04-09, **Remnant masses from 1D+ core-collapse supernovae simulations: bimodal neutron star mass distribution and black holes in the low-mass gap**, Luca Boccioli et.al., [2404.05927v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05927v1)

 The explosion of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is an extremely challenging problem, and there are still large uncertainties regarding which stars lead to successful explosions that leave behind a neutron star, and which ones will form a black hole instead. In this paper, we simulate 341 progenitors at three different metallicities using spherically symmetric simulations that include neutrino-driven convection via a mixing-length theory. We use these simulations to improve previously derived explosion criteria based on the density and entropy profiles of the pre-supernova progenitor. We also provide numerical fits to calculate the final mass of neutron stars based on either compactness, the location of the Si/Si-O interface, or the Chandrasekhar mass. The neutron star birth mass distribution derived from our 1D+ simulations is bimodal, contrary to what the most popular 1D CCSN simulations have shown so far. We compare the theoretically derived neutron star mass distributions with the observed ones and discuss potential implications for population synthesis studies. We also analyze the black hole mass distribution predicted by our simulations. To be consistent with current models of matter ejection in failed SNe, a large fraction of the envelope must be expelled, leading to small black holes in the low-mass gap. One black hole in this mass region has recently been observed in the GW230529 event by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Our results naturally agree with this detection, which the most popular prescriptions for explodability and remnant masses are not able to reproduce. In general, we find that the explosion outcome and mass of the remnant strongly depend on the pre-collapse structure of the progenitor. However, their dependence on the initial mass of the star and the mass of the CO core is highly uncertain and non-linear.

2024-04-08, **Equation of State of Hot Neutron Star Matter using Finite Range Simple Effective Interaction**, T. R. Routray et.al., [2404.05910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05910v1)

 The equation of state of hot neutron star matter of n+p+e+$\mu$ composition in $\beta$-equilibrium is studied for both neutrino-free isothermal and neutrino-trapped isentropic conditions, using the formalism where the thermal evolution is built upon its zero-temperature predictions in a self-consistent manner. The accuracy of the parabolic approximation, often used in the finite temperature calculation of hot neutron star matter, is verified by comparing with the results obtained from the exact evaluation in the neutrino-free neutron star matter. The equation of state of neutrino-trapped isentropic matter at low entropic condition, relevant to the core-collapsing supernovae, is formulated. In the isentropic matter, the particle fractions and equation of state have marginal variance as entropy per particle varies between 1 to 3 (in the unit of k$\_B$), but the temperature profile shows marked variation. The isentropes are found to be much less sensitive to the nuclear matter incompressibility, but have a large dependence on the slope parameter L. The bulk properties of the neutron stars predicted by the isentropic equation of state for different entropy are calculated. A model calculation for the early stage evolution of the protoneutron star to neutron star configuration is also given.

2024-04-08, **The neutrino background from non-jetted active galactic nuclei**, P. Padovani et.al., [2404.05690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05690v1)

 Aims. We calculate the contribution to the neutrino background from the non-jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) population following the recent IceCube association of TeV neutrinos with NGC 1068. Methods. We exploit our robust knowledge of the AGN X-ray luminosity function and evolution and convert it to the neutrino band by using NGC 1068 as a benchmark and a theoretically motivated neutrino spectrum. Results. The resulting neutrino background up to redshift 5 does not violate either the IceCube diffuse flux or the upper bounds for non-jetted AGN, although barely so. This is consistent with a scenario where the latter class makes a substantial contribution mostly below 1 PeV, while jetted AGN, i.e. blazars, dominate above this energy, in intriguing agreement with the dip in the neutrino data at ~ 300 TeV. More and better IceCube data on Seyfert galaxies will allow us to constrain the fraction of neutrino emitters among non-jetted AGN.

2024-04-08, **$(g-2)_{e,Î¼}$ anomalies and decays $h, Z\to e_b e_a $ in 3-3-1 models with inverse seesaw neutrinos**, T. T. Hong et.al., [2404.05524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05524v1)

 The Lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays $h, Z\to e\_b e\_a $, and $e\_b\to e\_a \gamma$ are discussed in a class of general 3-3-1 models adding heavy neutral leptons and singly charged Higgs bosons to accommodate experimental data of neutrino oscillation and $(g-2)\_{e\_a}$ anomalies of charged leptons through the inverse seesaw mechanism. We show that the models with the minimal number of inverse seesaw neutrinos can not reach the $1\sigma$ range of $(g-2)\_{\mu}$ data due to the experimental upper bounds on decay rates of $(\tau \to \mu \gamma)$ and $(\mu \to e \gamma)$. Features of LFV decays are presented in detail, focusing on the regions of parameter space satisfying the $1\sigma$ ranges of $(g-2)\_{e,\mu}$ data.

2024-04-08, **Search for Neutrino Emission from GRB 221009A using the KM3NeT ARCA and ORCA detectors**, S. Aiello et.al., [2404.05354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05354v1)

 Gamma-ray bursts are promising candidate sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. The recent GRB 221009A event, identified as the brightest gamma-ray burst ever detected, provides a unique opportunity to investigate hadronic emissions involving neutrinos. The KM3NeT undersea neutrino detectors participated in the worldwide follow-up effort triggered by the event, searching for neutrino events. In this letter, we summarize subsequent searches, in a wide energy range from MeV up to a few PeVs. No neutrino events are found in any of the searches performed. Upper limits on the neutrino emission associated with GRB 221009A are computed.

2024-04-09, **A minimal solution to the axion isocurvature problem from a non-minimal coupling**, Maximilian Berbig et.al., [2404.06441v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06441v1)

 The main limitation for pre-inflationary breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is the upper bound on the Hubble rate during inflation from axion isocurvature fluctuations. This leads to a tension between high scale inflation and QCD axions with Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale decay constants, which reduces the potential for a detection of tensor modes at next generation CMB experiments. We propose a mechanism that excplicitly breaks PQ symmetry via non-minimal coupling to gravity, that lifts the axion mass above the Hubble scale during inflation and has negligible impact on today's axion potential. The initially heavy axion gets trapped at an intermediate minimum during inflation given by the phase of the non-minimal coupling, before it moves to its true CP-conserving minimum after inflation. During this stage it undergoes coherent oscillations around an adiabatically decreasing minimum, which slightly dilutes the axion energy density, while still being able to explain the observed dark matter relic abundance. This scenario can be tested by the combination of next generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD with haloscopes such as ABRACADABRA or CASPEr-Electric.

2024-04-09, **Signatures of Four Fermion Contact Couplings of a Dark Fermion and an Electron at Hadron Collider**, Kai Ma et.al., [2404.06419v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06419v1)

 Both the collider searches and direct detections are promising approaches to probe a fermionic dark matter. In this paper we study signatures of the four fermion contact operators involving a dark fermion, an electron and a quark pair. We show that the mono-electron production channel at hadron collider can provide strong constraints. Associated productions of a charged electron with a photon/jet with missing energy are also studied. Using the current LHC data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$\,TeV, the lower bound on the energy scale of the (axial-)vector operator can reach to $12$\,TeV for a massless dark fermion. It can be further improved to about $24$\,TeV at the HE-LHC with $\sqrt{s} = 25$\,TeV and a total luminosity $20\,{\rm ab}^{-1}$. For the direct detections, the signal operators can generate induced $\beta^\pm$ decays. For the induced $\beta^-$ decay, we show that the constraints are weaker than the ones from the collider searches in almost all of the parameter space, and the accessible parameter space is already excluded by the current LHC data. In case of a relative heavy dark fermion (a few MeV), the induced $\beta^+$ decay is more sensitive than the collider search. Despite the advantage of the collider search that a much wider range of the dark fermion mass can be investigated, it can also provide a complementarity to the detect detections.

2024-04-09, **New Contributions to $b \to s Î³$ in Minimal G2HDM**, Che Hao Liu et.al., [2404.06397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06397v1)

 We study the flavor-changing bottom quark radiative decay $b \to s \gamma$ induced at one-loop level within the minimal gauged two-Higgs-doublet model (G2HDM). Among the three new contributions to this rare process in G2HDM, we find that only the charged Higgs $\mathcal{H^\pm}$ contribution can be constrained by the current global fit data in $B$-physics. Other two contributions from the complex vectorial dark matter $\mathcal{W}$ and dark Higgs $\mathcal{D}$ are not sensitive to the current data. Combining with theoretical constraints imposed on the scalar potential and electroweak precision data for the oblique parameters, we exclude mass regions $m\_{\mathcal{H}^\pm} \lesssim 250$ GeV and $m\_{\mathcal{D}} \lesssim 100$ GeV at the 95\% confidence level.

2024-04-09, **Reconciling $S_8$: Insights from Interacting Dark Sectors**, Rahul Shah et.al., [2404.06396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06396v1)

 We do a careful investigation of the prospects of dark energy (DE) interacting with cold dark matter (CDM) in alleviating the $S\_8$ clustering tension. To this end, we consider various well-known parametrizations of the DE equation of state (EoS), and consider perturbations in both the dark sectors, along with an interaction term. Moreover, we perform a separate study for the phantom and non-phantom regimes. Using CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets, the constraints on the model parameters for each case have been obtained and a generic reduction in the $H\_0-\sigma\_{8,0}$ correlation has been observed, both for constant and dynamical DE EoS. This reduction, coupled with a significant negative correlation between the interaction term and $\sigma\_{8,0}$, contributes to easing the clustering tension by lowering $\sigma\_{8,0}$ to somewhere in between the early CMB and late-time clustering measurements for the phantom regime, for almost all the models under consideration. In addition, this is achieved without exacerbating the Hubble tension. In this regard, the CPL and JBP models perform the best in relaxing the $S\_8$ tension to $<1\sigma$. However, for the non-phantom regime the $\sigma\_{8,0}$ tension tends to have worsened, which reassures the merits of phantom dark energy from latest data. We further do an investigation of the role of RSD datasets and find an overall reduction in tension, with a value of $\sigma\_{8,0}$ relatively closer to the CMB value. We finally check if further extensions of this scenario, like the inclusion of the sound speed of dark energy and warm dark matter interacting with DE, can have some effects.

2024-04-09, **Explaining the cosmological dark matter coincidence in asymmetric dark QCD**, Alexander C. Ritter et.al., [2404.05999v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05999v1)

 To properly solve the coincidence problem ($\Omega\_\mathrm{DM} \simeq 5\Omega\_\mathrm{VM}$) in a model of asymmetric dark matter, one cannot simply relate the number densities of visible and dark matter without also relating their particle masses. Following previous work, we consider a framework where the dark matter is a confined state of a dark QCD gauge group whose confinement scale is dynamically related to the QCD confinement scale by a mechanism utilising infrared fixed points of the two gauge couplings. In this work we present a new, `zero-coupling infrared fixed point' approach, which allows a larger proportion of models in this framework to generically relate the masses of the visible and dark matter particles. Due to the heavy mass scale required for the new field content, we introduce supersymmetry to the theory. We consider how these models may be incorporated in a full theory of asymmetric dark matter, presenting some example leptogenesis-like models. We also discuss the phenomenology of these models; in particular, there are gravitational wave signals which, while weak, may be measurable at future mHz and $\mu$Hz detectors.

2024-04-08, **The Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric of Nonlocal $\sqrt{dS}$ Gravity**, Ivan Dimitrijevic et.al., [2404.05848v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05848v1)

 It is already known that a simple nonlocal de Sitter gravity model, which we denote as $\sqrt{dS}$ gravity, contains an exact vacuum cosmological solution which mimics dark energy and dark matter and is in very good agreement with the standard model of cosmology. This success of $\sqrt{dS}$ gravity motivated us to investigate how it works at lower than cosmic scale -- galactic and the solar system. This paper contains our investigation of the corresponding Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric of the $\sqrt{dS}$ gravity model. To get exact solution, it is necessary to solve the corresponding nonlinear differential equation, what is a very complicated and difficult problem. What we obtained is a solution of linearized equation, which is related to space metric far from the massive body, where gravitational field is weak. The obtained approximate solution is of particular interest for examining the possible role of non-local de Sitter gravity $\sqrt{dS}$ in describing the effects in galactic dynamics that are usually attributed to dark matter. The solution has been tested on the Milky Way and the spiral galaxy M33 and is in good agreement with observational measurements.

2024-04-08, **Reconstructing rotation curves with artificial neural networks**, Gabriela Garcia-Arroyo et.al., [2404.05833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05833v1)

 Galactic rotation curves have been served as indispensable tools for determining the distribution of mass within galaxies. Despite several advances in precision observations, some discrepancies still persist between the inferred matter distribution from luminosity and observed rotation velocities, often attributed to the presence of dark matter. Traditional parametric models, while insightful, struggle with the complexity of galaxies with prominent bulges or non-circular motions, but in contrast, non-parametric methods offer a promising alternative, adapting to the intricate nature of rotation curves without any prior assumptions. In this work, we employ artificial neural networks to reconstruct rotation curves of 17 spiral galaxies from high-quality data, demonstrating the efficacy of the non-parametric approaches in characterizing galactic dynamics. Our findings underscore the importance of employing diverse methodological approaches to comprehensively understand galactic dynamics in modern astrophysics research. Moreover, the non-parametric reconstruction approach with neural networks presents a promising avenue for further investigations, capable of generating interpolations based on the intrinsic patterns of the data.

2024-04-08, **Novel collider signatures in the type-I 2HDM+$a$ model**, Spyros Argyropoulos et.al., [2404.05704v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05704v1)

 The 2HDM+$a$ model is one of the main models used in the interpretations of dark matter searches at the LHC. So far, all the 2HDM+$a$ benchmarks considered by the ATLAS and CMS experiments are limited to a type-II Yukawa sector, in which the Higgs bosons $A$, $H$, and $H^\pm$ are all constrained to be mass-degenerate and heavier than around $600 \, {\rm GeV}$. In this work, we present the first detailed study of 2HDM+$a$ models with a type-I Yukawa sector, which, for moderate values of $\tan\beta$, lift the constraints from flavour physics, allowing the extra Higgs bosons to be even lighter than the $125 \, {\rm GeV}$ Higgs boson discovered at the LHC. We discuss several benchmarks where the $A$, $H$, and $H^\pm$ states are not necessarily mass-degenerate and the signatures that arise in these models, some of which have not yet been explored at the LHC. We present the dominant channels in the studied benchmarks and the expected sensitivity in Run 2 data using truth-level analyses and discuss potential improvements in the experimental searches for Run 3.

 During the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, the LIGO Livingston observatory detected a coalescing compact binary, GW230529\_181500, with component masses of $2.5-4.5\, M\_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M\_\odot$ at the $90\%$ credible level. The gravitational-wave data alone is insufficient to determine whether the components are neutron stars or black holes. In this paper, we propose that GW230529\_181500 originated from the merger of two primordial black holes (PBHs). We estimate a merger rate of $5.0^{+47.0}\_{-4.9} \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to GW230529\_181500. Assuming the source is a PBH-PBH merger, GW230529-like events lead to approximately $1.7^{+36.2}\_{-1.5} \times 10^{-3}$ of the dark matter in the form of PBHs. The required abundance of PBHs to explain this event is consistent with existing upper limits derived from microlensing, cosmic microwave background observations and the null detection of gravitational wave background by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.

2024-04-08, **Dark matter free dwarf galaxy formation at the the tips of the tentacles of jellyfish galaxies**, V. Lora et.al., [2404.05676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05676v1)

 When falling into a galaxy cluster, galaxies experience a loss of gas due to ram pressure stripping. In particular, disk galaxies lose gas from their disks and very large tentacles of gas can be formed. Because of the morphology of these stripped galaxies they have been referred to as Jellyfish galaxies. It has been found that star formation is triggered not only in the disk, but also in the tentacles of such Jellyfish galaxies. The observed star forming regions located in the tentacles of those galaxies have been found to be as massive as $3\times10^7$ M$\_{\odot}$ and with sizes $> 100$ pc. Interestingly, these parameters in mass and size agree with those of dwarf galaxies. In this work we make use of the state of the art magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Illustris TNG-50, to study massive jellyfish galaxies with long tentacles. We find that, in the tentacles of TNG-50 Jellyfish galaxies, the star formation regions (gas+stars) formed could be as massive as $\sim2\times10^8$ M$\_{\odot}$. A particular star forming region was analyzed. This region has a star formation rate of $0.04$ M$\_{\odot}$/yr, it is metal rich, has an average age of $0.46$ Gyr, and has a half mass radius of $\sim1$ kpc, typical of standard dwarf galaxies. Most importantly, this region is gravitationally self-bound. All and all, we identify a new type of dwarf galaxy being born from the gas tentacles of jellyfish galaxies, that by construction lacks a dark matter (hereafter DM) halo.

2024-04-08, **Little Rip and Pseudo Rip cosmological models with coupled dark energy based on a new generalized entropy**, I. Brevik et.al., [2404.05597v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05597v1)

 We study Little Rip (LR) and Pseudo Rip (PR) cosmological models containing two coupled fluids: dark energy and dark matter. We assume a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. The interaction between the dark energy and the dark matter fluid components is described in terms of the parameters in the generalized equation of state (EoS) in presence of the bulk viscosity. We consider entropic cosmology and use a description based on a new generalized entropy function, which was proposed by Nojiri-Odintsov-Faraoni [1]. Conditions for the appearance of the (LR) and the (PR) in terms of the parameters of the (EoS) are obtained. Introducing an energy density $\rho\_g$ corresponding to a specified entropy function $S\_g$, together with an interaction term $Q$ in the gravitational equations of motion, we derive modified forms of the EoS parameters. We discuss the corrections of the thermodynamic parameters associated with the generalized entropy function. Properties of the late universe as well as in the early universe in this formalism are pointed out.

2024-04-08, **New ideas on the formation and astrophysical detection of primordial black holes**, Marcos M. Flores et.al., [2404.05430v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05430v1)

 Recently, a number of novel scenarios for primordial black hole (PBH) formation have been discovered. Some of them require very minimal new physics, some others require no new ingredients besides those already present in commonly considered models, such as supersymmetry. At the same time, new strategies have emerged for detection of PBHs. For example, an observation of an orphan kilonova unaccompanied by the gravitational waves signal of merging neutron stars, but associated with a fast radio burst, could be a smoking gun of PBH dark matter. We review some new ideas for PBH formation and detection.

2024-04-08, **The $Îº$-model under test of the SPARC database**, Gianni Pascoli et.al., [2404.05421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05421v1)

 Our main goal is here to make a comparative analysis between the well-known MOND theory and a more recent model called$\kappa$-model. An additional connection, between the $\kappa$-model and twoother novel MOND-type theories: Newtonian Fractional-DimensionGravity (NFDG) and Refracted Gravity (RG), is likewise presented.All these models are built to overtake the DM paradigm, or at leastto strongly reduce the dark matter content. Whereas they rely ondifferent formalisms, however, all four seem to suggest that the universal parameter, a0, appearing in MOND theory could intrinsicallybe correlated to either the sole baryonic mean mass density (RG and$\kappa$-model) and/or to the dimension of the object under consideration(NFDG and $\kappa$-model). We could then confer to the parameter a0 amore flexible status of multiscale parameter, as required to explainthe dynamics together in galaxies and in galaxy clusters. Eventually,the conformal gravity theory (CFT) also seems to have some remotelink with the $\kappa$-model, even though the first one is an extension ofgeneral relativity, and the second one is Newtonian in essence. The$\kappa$-model has been tested on a small sample of spiral galaxies and ingalaxy clusters. Now we test this model on a large sample of galaxiesissued from the SPARC database.

 Galaxy clusters are composed of dark matter, gas and stars. Their dark matter component, which amounts to around 80\% of the total mass, cannot be directly observed but traced by the distribution of diffused gas and galaxy members. In this work, we aim to infer the cluster's projected total mass distribution from mock observational data, i.e. stars, Sunyaev-Zeldovich, and X-ray, by training deep learning models. To this end, we have created a multiview images dataset from {\sc{The Three Hundred}} simulation that is optimal for training Machine Learning models. We further study deep learning architectures based on the U-Net to account for single-input and multi-input models. We show that the predicted mass distribution agrees well with the true one.

2024-04-08, **A theoretical perspective on the almost dark galaxy Nube: exploring the fuzzy dark matter model**, Yu-Ming Yang et.al., [2404.05375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05375v1)

 In recent astronomical observations, an almost dark galaxy, designated as Nube, has unveiled an intriguing anomaly in its stellar distribution. Specifically, Nube exhibits an exceptionally low central brightness, with the 2D half-light radius of its stars far exceeding the typical values found in dwarf galaxies, and even surpassing those observed in ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). This phenomenon is difficult to explain within the framework of cold dark matter (CDM). Meanwhile, due to its ultralight particle mass, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) exhibits a de Broglie wavelength on the order of kiloparsecs under the typical velocities of galaxies. The interference between different modes of the FDM wave gives rise to fluctuations in the gravitational field, which can lead to the dynamical heating of stars within galaxies, resulting in an expansion of their spatial distribution. In this paper, we aim to interpret the anomalous stellar distribution observed in Nube as a consequence of the dynamical heating effect induced by FDM. Our findings suggest that a FDM particle mass around $1-2\times 10^{-23}$ eV can effectively account for this anomaly. And we propose that the FDM dynamical heating effect provides a new insight into understanding the formation of field UDGs.

2024-04-08, **Dark matter phenomenology and phase transition dynamics of the next to minimal composite Higgs model with dilaton**, Borui Zhang et.al., [2404.05332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05332v1)

 In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the Next-to-Minimal Composite Higgs Model (NMCHM) extended with a dilaton field $\chi$ (denoted as NMCHM$\_\chi$). A pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) $\eta$, resulting from the SO(6)$\to$SO(5) breaking, serves as a dark matter (DM) candidate. The inclusion of the dilaton field is helpful for evading the stringent constraints from dark matter direct detection, as it allows for an accidental cancellation between the amplitudes of DM-nucleon scattering, an outcome of the mixing between the dilaton and Higgs fields. The presence of the dilaton field also enriches the phase transition patterns in the early universe. We identify two types of phase transitions: (i) a 1-step phase transition, where the chiral symmetry and electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) occur simultaneously, and (ii) a 2-step phase transition, where the chiral symmetry breaking transition takes place first, followed by a second phase transition corresponding to EWSB. Since the first-order phase transitions can be strong due to supercooling in our model, we also examine the stochastic background of gravitational waves generated by these phase transitions. We find that these gravitational waves hold promise for detection in future space-based gravitational wave experiments, such as LISA, Taiji, BBO, and DECIGO.

2024-04-08, **Cosmological fluids with boundary term couplings**, Christian G. Boehmer et.al., [2404.05301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05301v1)

 Cosmological models can be studied effectively using dynamical systems techniques. Starting from Brown's formulation of the variational principle for relativistic fluids, we introduce new types of couplings involving a perfect fluid, a scalar field, and boundary terms. We describe three different coupling models, one of which turns out to be particularly relevant for cosmology. Its behaviour is similar to that of models in which dark matter decays into dark energy. In particular, for a constant coupling, the model mimics well-known dynamical dark energy models while the non-constant couplings offer a rich dynamical structure, unseen before. We are able to achieve this richness whilst working in a two-dimensional phase space. This is a significant advantage which allows us to provide a clear physical interpretation of the key features and draw analogies with previously studied models.

 We develop methods to extract key dark energy information from cosmic distance measurements including the BAO scales and supernovae luminosity distances. Demonstrated using simulated datasets of the complete DESI, LSST and Roman surveys designed for BAO and SNe distance measurements, we show that using our method, the dynamical behaviour of the energy, pressure, equation of state (with its time derivative) of dark energy and the cosmic deceleration function can all be accurately recovered from high-quality data, which allows for robust diagnostic tests for dark energy models.

 Gravitational-wave (GW) observations of binary black-hole (BBH) coalescences are expected to address outstanding questions in astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Realizing the full discovery potential of upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing runs and new ground-based facilities hinges on accurate waveform models. Using linear-signal approximation methods and Bayesian analysis, we start to assess our readiness for what lies ahead using two state-of-the-art quasi-circular, spin-precessing models: \texttt{SEOBNRv5PHM} and \texttt{IMRPhenomXPHM}. We ascertain that current waveforms can accurately recover the distribution of masses in the LVK astrophysical population, but not spins. We find that systematic biases increase with detector-frame total mass, binary asymmetry, and spin-precession, with most such binaries incurring parameter biases, extending up to redshifts $\sim3$ in future detectors. Furthermore, we examine three ``golden'' events characterized by large mass ratios, significant spin magnitudes, and high precession, evaluating how systematic biases may affect their scientific outcomes. Our findings reveal that current waveforms fail to enable the unbiased measurement of the Hubble-Lema\^itre parameter from loud signals, even for current detectors. Moreover, highly asymmetric systems within the lower BH mass-gap exhibit biased measurements of the secondary-companion mass, which impacts the physics of both neutron stars and formation channels. Similarly, we deduce that the primary mass of massive binaries ($ > 60 M\_\odot$) will also be biased, affecting supernova physics. Future progress in analytical calculations and numerical-relativity simulations, crucial for calibrating the models, must target regions of the parameter space with significant biases to develop more accurate models. Only then can precision GW astronomy fulfill the promise it holds.

2024-04-08, **The MOSDEF Survey: Properties of Warm Ionised Outflows at $z=$ 1.4-3.8**, Andrew Weldon et.al., [2404.05725v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05725v1)

 We use the large spectroscopic data set of the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field survey to investigate the kinematics and energetics of ionised gas outflows. Using a sample of 598 star-forming galaxies at redshift 1.4 < $z$ < 3.8, we decompose $\rm{H}\alpha$ and [OIII] emission lines into narrow and broad components, finding significant detections of broad components in 10% of the sample. The ionised outflow velocity from individual galaxies appears independent of galaxy properties, such as stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), and star-formation-rate surface density ($\Sigma\_{\rm SFR}$). Adopting a simple outflow model, we estimate the mass-, energy- and momentum-loading factors of the ionised outflows, finding modest values with averages of 0.33, 0.04, and 0.22, respectively. The larger momentum- than energy-loading factors, for the adopted physical parameters, imply that these ionised outflows are primarily momentum-driven. We further find a marginal correlation (2.5$\sigma$) between the mass-loading factor and stellar mass in agreement with predictions by simulations, scaling as $\eta\_{m}$ $\propto M\_{\star}^{-0.45}$. This shallow scaling relation is consistent with these ionised outflows being driven by a combination of mechanical energy generated by supernovae explosions and radiation pressure acting on dusty material. In a majority of galaxies, the outflowing material does not appear to have sufficient velocity to escape the gravitational potential of their host, likely recycling back at later times. Together, these results suggest that the ionised outflows traced by nebular emission lines are negligible, with the bulk of mass and energy carried out in other gaseous phases.

2024-04-08, **Reconstructing the recombination history by combining early and late cosmological probes**, Gabriel P. Lynch et.al., [2404.05715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05715v1)

 We develop and apply a new framework for reconstructing the ionization history during the epoch of recombination with combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova data. We find a wide range of ionization histories that are consistent with current CMB data, and also that cosmological parameter constraints are significantly weakened once freedom in recombination is introduced. BAO data partially break the degeneracy between cosmological parameters and the recombination model, and are therefore important in these reconstructions. The 95% confidence upper limits on H0 are 80.1 (70.7) km/s/Mpc given CMB (CMB+BAO) data, assuming no other changes are made to the standard cosmological model. Including Cepheid-calibrated supernova data in the analysis drives a preference for non-standard recombination histories with visibility functions that peak early and exhibit appreciable skewness. Forthcoming measurements from SPT-3G will reduce the uncertainties in our reconstructions by about a factor of two.

2024-04-08, **The persistence of high altitude non-equilibrium diffuse ionized gas in simulations of star forming galaxies**, Lewis McCallum et.al., [2404.05651v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05651v2)

 Widespread, high altitude, diffuse ionized gas with scale heights of around a kiloparsec is observed in the Milky Way and other star forming galaxies. Numerical radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium show that gas can be driven to high altitudes above the galactic midplane, but the degree of ionization is often less than inferred from observations. For computational expediency, ionizing radiation from massive stars is often included as a post-processing step assuming ionization equilibrium. We extend our simulations of a Milky Way-like interstellar medium to include the combined effect of supernovae and photoionization feedback from midplane OB stars and a population of hot evolved low mass stars. The diffuse ionized gas has densities below 0.1 ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, so recombination timescales can exceed millions of years. Our simulations now follow the time-dependent ionization and recombination of low density gas. The long recombination timescales result in diffuse ionized gas that persists at large altitudes long after the deaths of massive stars that produce the vast majority of the ionized gas. The diffuse ionized gas does not exhibit the large variability inherent in simulations that adopt ionization equilibrium. The vertical distribution of neutral and ionized gas is close to what is observed in the Milky Way. The volume filling factor of ionized gas increases with altitude resulting in the scale height of free electrons being larger than that inferred from H$\alpha$ emission, thus reconciling the observations of ionized gas made in H$\alpha$ and from pulsar dispersion measurements.

2024-04-08, **A new solution of the pulsar equation**, Ioannis Contopoulos et.al., [2404.05408v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05408v1)

 We present the first new type of solution of the pulsar equation since 1999. In it, the whole magnetosphere is confined inside the light cylinder and an electrically charged layer wraps around it and holds it together. The reason this new solution has never been obtained before is that all current time-dependent simulations are initialized with a vacuum dipole configuration that extends to infinity, thus their final steady-state solution also extends to infinity. Under special conditions, such a confined configuration may be attained when the neutron star first forms in the interior of a collapsing star during a supernova explosion, or when it accretes from an external wind or disk from a donor star. It is shown that this new maximally closed non-decelerating solution is the limit of a continuous sequence of standard magnetospheres with open and closed field lines when the amount of open field lines gradually drops to zero. The minimum energy solution in this sequence is a standard magnetosphere in which the closed field line region extends up to about 80% of the light cylinder. We estimate that the released energy when the new solution transitions to the minimum energy one is enough to power a fast radio burst.

2024-04-08, **Constraints on the dense matter equation of state from young and cold isolated neutron stars**, Alessio Marino et.al., [2404.05371v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05371v1)

 Neutron stars are the dense and highly magnetic relics of supernova explosions of massive stars. The quest to constrain the Equation of State (EoS) of ultra-dense matter and thereby probe the behavior of matter inside neutron stars, is one of the core goals of modern physics and astrophysics. A promising method involves investigating the long-term cooling of neutron stars, and comparing theoretical predictions with various sources at different ages. However, limited observational data, and uncertainties in source ages and distances, have hindered this approach. In this work, re-analyzing XMM-Newton and Chandra data from dozens of thermally emitting isolated neutron stars, we have identified three sources with unexpectedly cold surface temperatures for their young ages. To investigate these anomalies, we conducted magneto-thermal simulations across diverse mass and magnetic fields, considering three different EoS. We found that the "minimal" cooling model, failed to explain the observations, regardless the mass and the magnetic field, as validated by a machine learning classification method. The existence of these young cold neutron stars suggests that any dense matter EoS must be compatible with a fast cooling process at least in certain mass ranges, eliminating a significant portion of current EoS options according to recent meta-modelling analysis.

2024-04-08, **A Monte-Carlo Simulation on Resonant Scattering of X-ray Line Emission in Supernova Remnants**, Yiping Li et.al., [2404.05171v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05171v1)

 Resonant scattering (RS) of X-ray line emission in supernova remnants (SNRs) may modify the observed line profiles and fluxes and has potential impact on estimating the physical properties of the hot gas and hence on understanding the SNR physics, but has not been theoretically modeled ever. Here we present our Monte-Carlo simulation of RS effect on X-ray resonant-line emission, typified by O VII He$\alpha$ r line, from SNRs. We employ the physical conditions characterized by the Sedov-Taylor solution and some basic parameters similar to those in Cygnus Loop. We show that the impact of RS effect is most significant near the edge of the remnant. The line profiles are predicted to be asymmetric because of different temperatures and photon production efficiencies of the expanding gas at different radii. We also predict the surface brightness of the line emission would decrease in the outer projected region but is slightly enhanced in the inner. The G-ratio of the OVII He$\alpha$ triplet can be effectively elevated by RS in the outer region. We show that RS effect of the O VII He$\alpha$ r line in the southwestern boundary region of Cygnus Loop is non-negligible. The observed OVII G-ratio $\sim$1.8 of the region could be achieved with RS taken into account for properly elevated O abundance from the previous estimates. Additional simulation performed for the SNRs in ejecta-dominated phase like Cas A shows that RS in the shocked ejecta may have some apparently effects on the observational properties of oxygen resonant lines.

2024-04-08, **Searching for Magnetar Binaries Disrupted by Core-Collapse Supernovae**, Myles B. Sherman et.al., [2404.05135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05135v1)

 Core-collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) are considered to be the primary magnetar formation channel, with 15 magnetars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs). A large fraction of these should occur in massive stellar binaries that are disrupted by the explosion, meaning that $\sim45\%$ of magnetars should be nearby high-velocity stars. Here we conduct a multi-wavelength search for unbound stars, magnetar binaries, and SNR shells using public optical ($uvgrizy-$bands), infrared ($J-$, $H-$, $K-$, and $K\_s-$bands), and radio ($888$ MHz, $1.4$ GHz, and $3$ GHz) catalogs. We use Monte Carlo analyses of candidates to estimate the probability of association with a given magnetar based on their proximity, distance, proper motion, and magnitude. In addition to recovering a proposed magnetar binary, a proposed unbound binary, and 13 of 15 magnetar SNRs, we identify two new candidate unbound systems: an OB star from the Gaia catalog we associate with SGR J1822.3-1606, and an X-ray pulsar we associate with 3XMM J185246.6+003317. Using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation that assumes all magnetars descend from CCSNe, we constrain the fraction of magnetars with unbound companions to $5\lesssim f\_u \lesssim 24\%$, which disagrees with population synthesis results. Alternate formation channels are unlikely to wholly account for the lack of unbound binaries as this would require $31\lesssim f\_{nc} \lesssim 66\%$ of magnetars to descend from such channels. Our results support a high fraction ($48\lesssim f\_m \lesssim 86\%$) of pre-CCSN mergers, which can amplify fossil magnetic fields to preferentially form magnetars.
