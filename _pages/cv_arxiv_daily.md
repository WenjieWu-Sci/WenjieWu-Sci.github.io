2023-08-30, **Lepton-induced reactions on nuclei in a wide kinematical regime**, U. Mosel et.al., [2308.16161v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16161v1)

 Inclusive differential cross sections for various $e A$ and $\nu A$ reactions are analyzed within the GiBUU theoretical framework and code. The treatment of electron-nuclus reactions has been significantly improved by implementing a parametrized description of electron-nucleon interactions for a nucleon. Using the momentum of a nucleon inside the Fermi sea the electron-nucleon cross sections are then Lorentz-boosted to obtain the electron structure functions for nuclei. The neutrino structure functions are obtained from the ones for electrons by a transformation that involves the axial formfactors and kinematical factors that account for the difference of vector and axial currents. Special emphasis is put on analyzing data from various different experiments in different neutrino energy regimes with one and the same theoretical input.

2023-08-30, **Neutrino constraints on inelastic dark matter captured in the Sun**, Bhavesh Chauhan et.al., [2308.16134v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16134v1)

 The flux of neutrinos from annihilation of gravitationally captured dark matter in the Sun has significant constraints from direct-detection experiments. However, these constraints are relaxed for inelastic dark matter as inelastic dark matter interactions generate less energetic nuclear recoils compared to elastic dark matter interactions. In this paper, we explore the possibility for large volume underground neutrino experiments to detect the neutrino flux from captured inelastic dark matter in the Sun. The neutrino spectrum has two components: a mono-energetic "spike" from pion and kaon decays at rest and a broad-spectrum "shoulder" from prompt primary meson decays. We focus on detecting the shoulder neutrinos from annihilation of hadrophilic inelastic dark matter with masses in the range 4-100 GeV and the mass splittings in up to 300 keV. We determine the event selection criterion for DUNE to identify GeV-scale muon neutrinos and anti-neutrinos originating from hadrophilic dark matter annihilation in the Sun, and forecast the sensitivity from contained events. We also map the current bounds from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube on elastic dark matter, as well as the projected limits from Hyper-Kamiokande, to the parameter space of inelastic dark matter. We find that there is a region of parameter space that these neutrino experiments are more sensitive to than the direct-detection experiments. For dark matter annihilation to heavy-quarks, the projected sensitivity of DUNE is weaker than current (future) Super (Hyper) Kamiokande experiments. However, for the light-quark channel, only the spike is observable and DUNE will be the most sensitive experiment.

2023-08-30, **Shedding light on neutrino self-interactions with solar antineutrino searches**, Quan-feng Wu et.al., [2308.15849v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15849v1)

 Solar antineutrinos are absent in the standard solar model prediction. Consequently, solar antineutrino searches emerge as a powerful tool to probe new physics capable of converting neutrinos into antineutrinos. In this study, we highlight that neutrino self-interactions, recently gaining considerable attention due to their cosmological and astrophysical implications, can lead to significant solar antineutrino production. We systematically explore various types of four-fermion effective operators and light scalar mediators for neutrino self-interactions. By estimating the energy spectra and event rates of solar antineutrinos at prospective neutrino detectors such as JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande, and THEIA, we reveal that solar antineutrino searches can impose stringent constraints on neutrino self-interactions and probe the parameter space favored by the Hubble tension.

2023-08-30, **A Dual-Zone Diffusion Model for High Energy Emissions of the Cygnus Cocoon**, Shihong Zhan et.al., [2308.15831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15831v1)

 As one of the brightest galactic ${\gamma}$-ray sources, the Cygnus Cocoon superbubble has been observed by many detectors, such as $Fermi$-LAT, ARGO, HAWC, and LHAASO. However, the origin of $\gamma$-ray emission for the Cygnus Cocoon and the possible contribution to PeV cosmic rays are still under debate. The recent ultrahigh-energy $\gamma$-ray observations by LHAASO up to 1.4 PeV towards the direction of the Cygnus Cocoon, as well as the neutrino event report of IceCube-201120A coming from the same direction, suggest that the Cygnus Cocoon may be one of the sources of high-energy cosmic rays in the Galaxy. In this work, we propose a dual-zone diffusion model for the Cygnus Cocoon: the cocoon region and surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This scenario can account for the $\gamma$-ray data from GeV to $\sim$ 50 TeV and agree with the one sub-PeV neutrino event result from IceCube so far. Moreover, it predict a non-negligible contribution $\gamma$-ray emission at hundreds TeV from the ISM surrounding the Cygnus Cocoon. This possible diffuse TeV-PeV gamma-ray features can be resolved by the future LHAASO observations.

2023-08-30, **Overview and First Results of EUSO-SPB2**, Johannes Eser et.al., [2308.15693v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15693v1)

 Observing ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and very high energy (VHE) neutrinos from space is a promising way to measure their extremely low fluxes by significantly increasing the observed volume. The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2), the next, most advanced pathfinder for such a mission, was launched May 13th 2023 from Wanaka New Zealand. The pioneering EUSO-SPB2 payload flew a Fluorescence Telescope (FT) with a PMT camera pointed in nadir to record fluorescence light from cosmic ray extensive air shower (EAS) with energies above 1 EeV, and a Cherenkov telescope (CT) with a silicon photomultiplier focal surface for observing Cherenkov emission of cosmic ray EAS with energies above 1 PeV with an above-the-limb geometry and of PeV-scale EAS initiated by neutrino-sourced tau decay. As the CT is a novel instrument, optical background measurements for space neutrino observation are an important goal of the mission. Any data collected during the mission will influence and improve the development of a space-based multi-messenger observatory such as the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). We present an overview of the EUSO-SPB2 mission and its science goals and summarize results as available, from the 2023 flight.

2023-08-29, **Ab initio uncertainty quantification of neutrinoless double-beta decay in $^{76}$Ge**, A. Belley et.al., [2308.15634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15634v1)

 The observation of neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay would offer proof of lepton number violation, demonstrating that neutrinos are Majorana particles, while also helping us understand why there is more matter than antimatter in the Universe. If the decay is driven by the exchange of the three known light neutrinos, a discovery would, in addition, link the observed decay rate to the neutrino mass scale through a theoretical quantity known as the nuclear matrix element (NME). Accurate values of the NMEs for all nuclei considered for use in $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments are therefore crucial for designing and interpreting those experiments. Here, we report the first comprehensive ab initio uncertainty quantification of the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay NME, in the key nucleus $^{76}$Ge. Our method employs nuclear strong and weak interactions derived within chiral effective field theory and recently developed many-body emulators. Our result, with a conservative treatment of uncertainty, is an NME of $3.44^{+1.33}\_{-1.56}$, which, together with the best-existing half-life sensitivity, sets an upper limit for effective neutrino mass of $141^{+117}\_{-39}$ meV. The result is important for designing next-generation germanium detectors aiming to cover the entire inverted hierarchy region of neutrino masses. When extended to other isotopes, our approach will allow a careful comparison of experiments.

2023-08-29, **Examining the sensitivity of FASER to Generalized Neutrino Interactions**, F. J. Escrihuela et.al., [2308.15630v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15630v1)

 We investigate the sensitivity of the FASER$\nu$ detector, a novel experimental setup at the LHC, to probe and constrain generalized neutrino interactions (GNI). Employing a comprehensive theoretical framework, we model the effects of generalized neutrino interactions on neutrino-nucleon deep inelastic scattering processes within the FASER$\nu$ detector. By considering all the neutrino channels produced at the LHC, we perform a statistical analysis to determine the sensitivity of FASER$\nu$ to constrain these interactions. Our results demonstrate that FASER$\nu$ can place stringent constraints on the GNI effective couplings. Additionally, we study the relation between GNI and a minimal Leptoquark model where the SM is augmented by a singlet Leptoquark with hypercharge $1/3$. We have found that the sensitivities for various combinations of the Leptoquark Yukawa couplings are approximately $\mathcal{O}(1)$, particularly when considering a Leptoquark mass in the TeV range.

2023-08-29, **The EUSO-SPB2 Cherenkov Telescope -- Flight Performance and Preliminary Results**, Eliza Gazda et.al., [2308.15628v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15628v1)

 Astrophysical Very-High-Energy (VHE, >10PeV) neutrinos deliver crucial information about the sources of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), the composition of UHECRs, and neutrino/particle physics at highest energies. UHE-tau neutrinos skimming the Earth's surface produce tau leptons, which can emerge from the ground, decay, and start an upward-going extensive air shower (EAS) in the Earth's atmosphere. The tau neutrino can be reconstructed by imaging the EAS. We developed an atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope flying on the Extreme Universe Space Observatory Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) mission to test the air-shower imaging concept at highest altitudes. The EUSO-SPB2 ultra-long-duration balloon mission is a precursor of the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA), a candidate for an astrophysics probe-class mission. The telescope implements Schmidt optics with a 0.785 m^2 light collection area and a 512-pixel SiPM camera covering a 12.8{\deg} by 6.4{\deg} (Horizontal by Vertical) field-of-view with 0.4{\deg} resolution. The camera signals are sampled with 100MSa/s and digitized with 12-bit resolution. The objectives of the EUSO-SPB2 Cherenkov telescope include a search for UHE neutrinos below Earth's limb, UHECRs above the limb, the study of the night sky background, and studying the telescope's performance. In this presentation, I will present an overview of the Cherenkov telescope and discuss the in-flight performance of the telescope.

2023-08-29, **Non-standard cosmic expansion histories: Neutrino decoupling and primordial nucleosynthesis signatures**, D. Aristizabal Sierra et.al., [2308.15531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15531v1)

 Cosmological scenarios with a non-standard equation of state can involve ultrastiff fluids, understood as primordial fluids for which $p/\rho> 1$. Their energy densities can dominate the Universe energy budget at early times, in the otherwise radiation dominated epoch. During that period the Universe undergoes a faster expansion, that has implications for any decoupling process that takes place in that era. Quintessence models or Ekpyrotic cosmologies are good examples of such scenarios. Assuming the ultrastiff state to be thermally decoupled at very early times, if ever coupled, its observational imprints are left solely in the Universe expansion rate and in the radiation energy density. We consider a complete set of ultrastiff fluids and study their signatures in the neutrino decoupling and BBN eras. Measurements of $N\_\text{eff}$ alone place mild constraints on these scenarios, with forthcoming measurements from the Simons Observatory in the Chilean Atacama desert being able to test regions where still sizable effects are observable. However, when BBN data is taken into account, those regions are proven to be barely reconcilable with primordial helium-4 and deuterium abundances measurements. Our findings show that measurements of the primordial helium-4 abundance imply the tightest constraints, with measurements of primordial deuterium being -- to a certain extent -- competitive as well. We point out that a $\sim 60\%$ improvement on the statistical uncertainty of the primordial helium-4 abundance measurement, will test these scenarios in the region where they can produce sizable effects. Beyond that precision the regions that are accessible degenerate with standard expectations. In that case, although potentially present, neither neutrino decoupling nor BBN observables will be sensitive probes.

2023-08-29, **Interfacing Electron and Neutrino Quasielastic Scattering Cross Sections with the Spectral Function in GENIE**, Minerba Betancourt et.al., [2308.15524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15524v1)

 Progress in neutrino-nucleus cross section models is being driven by the need for highly accurate predictions for the neutrino oscillation community. These sophisticated models are being developed within a microscopic description of the nucleus with the goal of encompassing all reaction modes relevant for the accelerator neutrino program. The disconnect between these microscopic models and the event generators that will be used in the next generation of experiments represents a critical obstacle that must be overcome in order to precisely measure the neutrino oscillation parameters. To this end we have developed a Fortran wrapper for lepton-nucleus quasielastic (QE) scattering within the GENIE event generator as a proof of principle, with the broader goal of creating an efficient pipeline for incorporating advanced theoretical models in event generators. As a demonstration of this interface, we have implemented the Spectral Function model into GENIE, offering a more complete description of the nuclear ground state, as well as the ability to provide quantifiable theoretical uncertainties. We validate this implementation and compare its predictions against data and against QE models already available in GENIE.

2023-08-29, **The Terzina instrument onboard the NUSES space mission**, R. Aloisio et.al., [2308.15342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15342v1)

 In this paper we will introduce the Terzina instrument, which is one of the two scientific payloads of the NUSES satellite mission. NUSES serves as a technological pathfinder, hosting a suite of innovative instruments designed for the in-orbit detection of cosmic rays, neutrinos, and gamma rays across various energy ranges. The Terzina instrument itself is a compact telescope equipped with Schmidt-Cassegrain optics. Its primary objective is to detect Cherenkov radiation emitted by Extensive Air Showers generated by the interaction of high-energy (> 100 PeV) cosmic rays with the Earth's atmosphere. Terzina represents a critical step forward in the development of future space-based instruments aimed at detecting upward-moving showers induced by tau-leptons and muons resulting from the interaction of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos with the Earth. In this paper, we will delve into the key technical aspects of the Terzina instrument, its capabilities, and its potential for detection.

2023-08-29, **A flexible and efficient approach for missing transverse momentum reconstruction**, William Balunas et.al., [2308.15290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15290v1)

 Missing transverse momentum is a crucial observable for physics at hadron colliders, being the only constraint on the kinematics of "invisible" objects such as neutrinos and hypothetical dark matter particles. Computing missing transverse momentum at the highest possible precision, particularly in experiments at the energy frontier, can be a challenging procedure due to ambiguities in the distribution of energy and momentum between many reconstructed particle candidates. This paper describes a novel solution for efficiently encoding information required for the computation of missing transverse momentum given arbitrary selection criteria for the constituent reconstructed objects. Pileup suppression using information from both the calorimeter and the inner detector is an integral component of the reconstruction procedure. Energy calibration and systematic variations are naturally supported. Following this strategy, the ATLAS Collaboration has been able to optimise the use of missing transverse momentum in diverse analyses throughout Runs 2 and 3 of the Large Hadron Collider and for future analyses.

2023-08-29, **Sensitivity of IceCube-Gen2 to measure flavor composition of Astrophysical neutrinos**, Neha Lad et.al., [2308.15220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15220v1)

 The observation of an astrophysical neutrino flux in IceCube and its detection capability to separate between the different neutrino flavors has led IceCube to constraint the flavor content of this flux. IceCube-Gen2 is the planned extension of the current IceCube detector, which will be about 8 times larger than the current instrumented volume. In this work, we study the sensitivity of IceCube-Gen2 to the astrophysical neutrino flavor composition and investigate its tau neutrino identification capabilities. We apply the IceCube analysis on a simulated IceCube-Gen2 dataset that mimics the High Energy Starting Event (HESE) classification. Reconstructions are performed using sensors that have 3 times higher quantum efficiency and isotropic angular acceptance compared to the current IceCube optical modules. We present the projected sensitivity for 10 years of data on constraining the flavor ratio of the astrophysical neutrino flux at Earth by IceCube-Gen2.

2023-08-29, **Summary of IceCube Tau Neutrino Searches and Flavor Composition Measurements of the Diffuse Astrophysical Neutrino Flux**, Neha Lad et.al., [2308.15213v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15213v1)

 We present a summary of the flavor composition measurements for the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole. IceCube has identified candidate astrophysical tau neutrinos through two different approaches. One approach used a dedicated particle identification algorithm for the classification and reconstruction of the 'Double Cascade' event topology, a signature of tau neutrino charged current interactions. This first approach is applied to the High Energy Starting Events (HESE) sample, an all-sky, all-flavor set of neutrino events with energy above 60~TeV encompassing 12 years of IceCube livetime. We show that the addition of more years of data and updated ice properties on the HESE sample delivers tighter constraints on the flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrino flux than previous IceCube analyses, in particular when it is fit in combination with high statistics samples of through-going tracks and cascades. A second approach uses a sensitive machine-learning-based selection technique that finds seven candidate events in 9.7 years of IceCube data. This approach excludes the zero astrophysical tau neutrino hypothesis at the highest statistical significance to date.

2023-08-29, **Octant Degeneracy and Plots of Parameter Degeneracy in Neutrino Oscillations Revisited**, Sho Sugama et.al., [2308.15071v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15071v1)

 The three kinds of parameter degeneracy in neutrino oscillation, the intrinsic, sign and octant degeneracy, form an eight-fold degeneracy. The nature of this eight-fold degeneracy can be visualized on the ($\sin^22\theta\_{13}$, $1/\sin^2\theta\_{23}$)-plane, through quadratic curves defined by $P(\nu\_\mu\to\nu\_e)=$ const. and $P(\bar{\nu}\_\mu\to\bar{\nu}\_e)=$ const., along with a straight line $P(\nu\_\mu\to\nu\_\mu)=$ const. After $\theta\_{13}$ was determined by reactor neutrino experiments, the intrinsic degeneracy in $\theta\_{13}$ transforms into an alternative octant degeneracy in $\theta\_{23}$, which can potentially be resolved by incorporating the value of $P(\nu\_\mu\to\nu\_\mu)$. In this paper, we analytically discuss whether this octant parameter degeneracy is resolved or persists in the future long baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, such as T2HK, DUNE, T2HKK and ESS$\nu$SB. It is found that the energy spectra near the first oscillation maximum are effective in resolving the octant degeneracy, whereas those near the second oscillation maximum are not.

2023-08-30, **On the oscillating electric dipole moment induced by axion-fermion couplings**, Luca Di Luzio et.al., [2308.16135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16135v1)

 It has been recently claimed that the axion coupling to fermions is responsible for an oscillating electric dipole moment (EDM) in the background of axion dark matter. In this work, we re-examine the derivation of this effect. Contrary to previous studies, we point out the physical relevance of an axion boundary term, which is crucial in restoring the axion shift symmetry and drastically affects the EDM phenomenology. To describe the latter, we introduce the notion of a time-integrated effective axion EDM, which encodes the boundary term and whose magnitude depends on the oscillating regime. For slow oscillations the boundary term washes out the standard oscillating EDM, resulting in an exact cancellation in the static limit. Conversely, during fast oscillations, the boundary term amplifies the effective EDM. This new observable is especially interesting in the case of the electron EDM. Remarkably, for an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ axion-electron coupling, the overall size of the effective EDM in the intermediate oscillations regime is comparable to the present static EDM limit.

2023-08-30, **Circumgalactic Ly$α$ emission around submillimeter-bright galaxies with different quasar contributions**, Vale González Lobos et.al., [2308.15955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15955v1)

 We present VLT/MUSE observations targeting the extended Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission of five high-redshift ($z\sim$3-4) submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) with increasing quasar (QSO) radiation: two SMGs, two SMGs hosting a QSO, and one SMG hosting a QSO with a SMG companion (QSO+SMG). These sources should be located in dark matter halos of comparable masses (average mass of $M\_{\rm DM}\sim10^{12.2}\,{\rm M}\_\odot$). We quantify the luminosity and extent of the Ly$\alpha$ emission, together with its kinematics, and examine four Ly$\alpha$ powering mechanisms: photoionization from QSOs/star formation, shocks by galactic/QSO outflows, gravitational cooling radiation, and Ly$\alpha$ photons resonant scattering. We find a variety of Ly$\alpha$ luminosities and extents, with the QSO+SMG system displaying the most extended and bright nebula, followed by the SMGs hosting a QSO, and finally the undetected circumgalactic medium (CGM) of SMGs. This diversity implies that gravitational cooling is unlikely to be the main powering mechanism. We show that photoionization from the QSO and QSO outflows can contribute to power the emission for average densities $n\_{\rm H}>0.5\,$cm$^{-3}$. Moreover, the observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosities scale with the QSO's budget of Ly$\alpha$ photons modulo the dust content in each galaxy, highlighting a possible contribution from resonant scattering of QSO's radiation in powering the nebulae. We find larger Ly$\alpha$ linewidths (FWHM$\gtrsim 1200\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$) than usually reported around radio-quiet systems, pointing to large-scale outflows. A statistical survey targeting similar high-redshift massive systems with known host properties is needed to confirm our findings.

2023-08-30, **Dynamics of Dwarf Galaxies in Scalar-Tensor-Vector-Gravity**, Ivan De Martino et.al., [2308.15908v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15908v1)

 We have investigated whether the Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity theory (STVG) may explain the kinematic of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. STVG modifies General Relativity by adding extra scalar and vector fields with the main aim of replacing dark matter in astrophysical self-gravitating systems. The weak-field limit of STVG brings a Yukawa-like modification to the Newtonian gravitational potential. The modification is modulated by two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\mu$, that represent a redefinition of the gravitational coupling constant and the mass of the additional vector fields, respectively. Thus, adopting the modified gravitational potential arising in the weak-field limit of STVG, we have solved the spherical Jeans equation to predict the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles of eight dwarf spheroidal galaxies orbiting around the Milky Way. The predicted profiles are then compared to the data using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm. Our results pointed out some tensions on the $\alpha$ parameter within the data set, while comparison with previous analysis shows the effectiveness of STVG in replacing dark matter with extra massive fields. Further improvements will require more sophisticated modelling of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion which will be possible as soon as high-precision astrometric data in dwarf spheroidals will become available.

2023-08-30, **The destiny of Dark Matter**, Fabiano Tracanna et.al., [2308.15903v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15903v1)

 The majority of baryons, which account for $15\%$ of the matter in the Universe, will end their lives as carbon and oxygen inside cold black dwarfs. Dark matter (DM) makes up the remaining $85\%$ of the matter in the universe, however, the fate of DM is unknown. Here we show that the destiny of purely gravitationally interacting DM particles follows one of two possible routes. The first possible route, the "radiation-destiny" scenario, is that massive DM particles lose sufficient energy through gravitational radiation causing them to spiral into a supermassive black hole that ultimately disappears through Hawking radiation. The second possible route, the "drifting-alone" destiny, applies to lighter DM particles, where only the central DM halo region spirals into the central BH which is then Hawking radiated away. The rest of the DM halo is ripped apart by the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

2023-08-30, **The effect of dark matter spikes on galactic black hole ringdown waveforms and shadows**, Ramin G. Daghigh et.al., [2308.15682v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15682v1)

 We investigate the effect of dark matter spikes on the ringdown waveforms and shadows of the supermassive black holes at the core of the Milky Way and M87. The dominant effect comes in the form of a redshift factor due to the mass of the spike and is significant for large supermassive black holes such as M87*. The subdominant contributions, recently calculated in {\it ApJ} {\bf 940} 33 (2022), give information about the distribution of matter in the spike. We show that these subdominant contributions are small as compared to the redshift factor and likely difficult to detect except perhaps for very large black holes. We also show that the effect of a dark matter spike, with density near the observational upper bounds, on the shadow radius of M87* is only an order of magnitude smaller than is currently accessible with Event Horizon Telescope data.

2023-08-29, **Low-noise single-photon counting superconducting nanowire detectors at infrared wavelengths up to 29 $μ$m**, Gregor G. Taylor et.al., [2308.15631v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15631v1)

 We report on the extension of the spectral sensitivity of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to a wavelength of 29 $\mu$m. This represents the first demonstration of a time correlated single-photon counting detector at these long infrared wavelengths. We achieve saturated internal detection efficiency from 10 to 29 $\mu$m, whilst maintaining dark count rates below 0.1 counts per second. Extension of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to this spectral range provides low noise and high timing resolution photon counting detection, effectively providing a new class of single-photon sensitive detector for these wavelengths. These detectors are important for applications such as exoplanet spectroscopy, infrared astrophysics, physical chemistry, remote sensing and direct dark-matter detection.

2023-08-29, **Probing Light Dark Matter with positron beams at NA64**, Yu. M. Andreev et.al., [2308.15612v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15612v1)

 We present the results of a missing-energy search for Light Dark Matter which has a new interaction with ordinary matter transmitted by a vector boson, called dark photon $A^\prime$. For the first time, this search is performed with a positron beam by using the significantly enhanced production of $A^\prime$ in the resonant annihilation of positrons with atomic electrons of the target nuclei, followed by the invisible decay of $A^\prime$ into dark matter. No events were found in the signal region with $(10.1 \pm 0.1)~\times~10^{9}$ positrons on target with 100 GeV energy. This allowed us to set new exclusion limits that, relative to the collected statistics, prove the power of this experimental technique. This measurement is a crucial first step toward a future exploration program with positron beams, whose estimated sensitivity is here presented.

2023-08-29, **Non-local Interactions are Essential Elements for Dark Matter Halo Stability: A Cross-Model Study**, Ahmad Borzou et.al., [2308.15592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15592v1)

 This paper introduces a comprehensive methodology for examining the stability of dark matter (DM) halos, emphasizing the necessity for non-local inter-particle interactions, whether they are fundamental or effective in nature, to maintain halo stability. We highlight the inadequacy of vanilla cold collision-less DM models in forecasting a stable halo without considering a "non-local" interaction in the halo's effective free energy, which could potentially arise from factors like baryonic feedback, self-interactions, or the intrinsic quantum characteristics of dark particles. The stability prerequisite necessitates significant effective interactions between any two points within the halo, regardless of their distance from the center. The methodology proposed herein offers a systematic framework to scrutinize the stability of various DM models and refine their parameter spaces. We deduce that DM halos within a model, where the deviation from the standard cold collision-less framework is confined to regions near the halo center, are unlikely to exhibit stability in their outer sectors. In our study, we demonstrate that the issue of instability within DM halos cannot be addressed adequately using perturbative quantum effects. This issue is less pronounced for fermionic DM but suffers from a higher degree of severity when considering bosonic DM. We find that halos made of bosons with notable quantum effects have sharp edges, while those made of fermions show more diffuse boundaries extending toward infinity. We also explore the broadest form of the effective free-energy around a chosen mass profile.

2023-08-29, **The Dark Matter Discovery Potential of the Advanced Particle-Astrophysics Telescope (APT)**, Fei Xu et.al., [2308.15538v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15538v1)

 Gamma-ray observations of Milky Way dwarf galaxies have been used to place stringent constraints on the dark matter's annihilation cross section. In this paper, we evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed Advanced Particle-astrophysics Telescope (APT) to dark matter in these systems, finding that such an instrument would be capable of constraining thermal relics with masses as large as $m\_X\sim 600 \, {\rm GeV}$. Furthermore, in dark matter scenarios motivated by the observed Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess, we predict that APT would detect several dwarf galaxies with high-significance. Such observations could be used to test the predicted proportionality between the gamma-ray fluxes and $J$-factors of individual dwarf galaxies, providing us with an unambiguous test of the origin of the Galactic Center Excess.

2023-08-29, **Are there any extragalactic high speed dark matter particles in the Solar neighborhood?**, Isabel Santos-Santos et.al., [2308.15388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15388v1)

 We use the APOSTLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the Local Group to examine the high speed tail of the local dark matter velocity distribution in simulated Milky Way analogues. The velocity distribution in the Solar neighborhood is well approximated by a generalized Maxwellian distribution sharply truncated at a well-defined maximum ``escape" speed. The truncated generalized Maxwellian distribution accurately models the local dark matter velocity distribution of all our Milky Way analogues, with no evidence for any separate extragalactic high-speed components. The local maximum speed is well approximated by the terminal velocity expected for particles able to reach the Solar neighborhood in a Hubble time from the farthest confines of the Local Group. This timing constraint means that the local dark matter velocity distribution is unlikely to contain any high-speed particles contributed by the Virgo Supercluster ``envelope", as argued in recent works. Particles in the Solar neighborhood with speeds close to the local maximum speed can reach well outside the virial radius of the Galaxy, and, in that sense, belong to the Local Group envelope posited in earlier work. The local manifestation of such envelope is thus not a distinct high-speed component, but rather simply the high-speed tail of the truncated Maxwellian distribution.

 In a non-standard cosmological scenario, heavy, long-lived particles, which we call moduli, dominate the energy density prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) may be produced non-thermally from moduli decays. The final relic abundance then depends on additional parameters such as the branching ratio of moduli to WIMPs and the modulus mass. This is of interest for WIMP candidates, such as a bino-like neutralino, where thermal production in standard cosmology leads to an overdensity. Previous works have shown that the correct dark matter (DM) relic density can then still be obtained if the moduli, with mass less than $10^{7}$ GeV, decay to WIMPs with a branching ratio of less than $10^{-4}$. This upper bound could easily be violated once higher order corrections, involving final states with more than two particles, are included. We compute the branching ratios of three- and four-body decays of a modulus into final states involving two DM particles for general couplings. We then apply these expressions to sparticle production within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with neutralino DM. We find that this upper bound on the branching ratio can be satisfied in simplified models through an appropriate choice of as yet undetermined couplings. However, in the MSSM, it requires sparticle masses to be very close to half the modulus mass, in contrast to the idea of weak-scale supersymmetry.

 In this work, we explore the effects of surrounding dark matter featuring different equations of state on the axial gravitational quasinormal modes of supermassive black holes situated at the center of galaxies. Our attention primarily rests on dark matter exhibiting a spike structure, originating from relativistic Bondi accretion through an adiabatic process, which diminishes at a certain distance from the black hole. We analyze how varying the equation of state of the dark matter influences the properties of the spacetime in the black hole's vicinity. Our findings reveal that different states of dark matter spikes correspondingly affect the black hole's quasinormal modes. In particular, we identify deviations in both the ringing frequency and damping time, reaching magnitudes of up to $10^{-3}$ for certain parameter values. These variations can potentially be detected by upcoming space-borne detectors. Our findings thus indicate the feasibility of discerning and limiting the essential properties of dark matter surrounding supermassive black holes using future gravitational wave detections, particularly in the case of extreme mass ratio inspiral systems.

 We explore the phenomenology of QCD axion and axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter production via misalignment during inflationary reheating. We investigate scenarios involving inflaton oscillating in a generic potential $\sim \phi^n$, considering inflaton decay and annihilation for reheating. For low reheating temperatures, the parameter space leading to the correct relic abundance can be enlarged beyond the standard case. Depending on the type of inflaton-matter couplings and the value of $n$, we find that certain parts of the extended parameter space are already constrained by ADMX, CAPP, and MUSE experiments. Future Haloscope experiments are expected to impose stringent constraints. We highlight the potential to utilize axion experiments in constraining the dynamics of reheating.

 The Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) is an electron-beam fixed-target experiment designed to achieve comprehensive model independent sensitivity to dark matter particles in the sub-GeV mass region. An upgrade to the LCLS-II accelerator will increase the beam energy available to LDMX from 4 to 8 GeV. Using detailed GEANT4-based simulations, we investigate the effect of the increased beam energy on the capabilities to separate signal and background, and demonstrate that the veto methodology developed for 4 GeV successfully rejects photon-induced backgrounds for at least $2\times10^{14}$ electrons on target at 8 GeV.

 The $S\_8$ tension between low-redshift galaxy surveys and the primary CMB signals a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Recently differing results have been obtained using low-redshift galaxy surveys and the higher redshifts probed by CMB lensing, motivating a possible time-dependent modification to the growth of structure. We investigate a simple phenomenological model in which the growth of structure deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction at late times, in particular as a simple function of the dark energy density. Fitting to galaxy lensing, CMB lensing, BAO, and Supernovae datasets, we find significant evidence - 2.5 - 3$\sigma$, depending on analysis choices - for a non-zero value of the parameter quantifying a deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. The preferred model, which has a slower growth of structure below $z\sim 1$, improves the joint fit to the data over $\Lambda$CDM. While the overall fit is improved, there is weak evidence for galaxy and CMB lensing favoring different changes in the growth of structure.

2023-08-30, **The dawn is quiet here: Rise in [$α$/Fe] is a signature of massive gas accretion that fueled proto-Milky Way**, Boquan Chen et.al., [2308.15976v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15976v1)

 The proto-Milky Way epoch forms the earliest stars in our Galaxy and sets the initial conditions for subsequent disk formation. Recent observations from APOGEE and H3 surveys showed that the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio slowly declined between [Fe/H] $=-3$ and $-1.3$ until it reached the lowest value ($\sim 0.25$) among the selected in situ metal-poor stars that most likely formed during the proto-Galaxy epoch. [$\alpha$/Fe] rose to meet the traditional high value commonly associated with the thick disk population at [Fe/H] $=-1$. It was suggested that the rise in [$\alpha$/Fe] could be caused by an increase in the star formation efficiency (SFE), known as the "simmering" phase scenario. However, gas inflow also plays a vital role in shaping the star formation history and chemical evolution of galaxies. We investigate this unexpected [$\alpha$/Fe]-rise with a statistical experiment involving a galactic chemical evolution (GCE). Our model has five free parameters: the mass of the initial reservoir of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) at birth, the frequency of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the cooling timescale of the warm ISM, the SFE, and the inflow rate of fresh gas. The last two free parameters were allowed to change after [$\alpha$/Fe] reached its lowest value, dividing the proto-Galaxy epoch into two phases. We find that the rise in [$\alpha$/Fe] is caused by a large inflow of fresh gas and conclude that the [$\alpha$/Fe]-rise is a signature of the cold mode accretion whose materials formed the prototype Milky Way preceding disk formation. Although the SFE is essential in regulating the chemical evolution, it does not necessarily increase to facilitate the [$\alpha$/Fe]-rise.

2023-08-30, **Jitter radiation as an alternative mechanism for the nonthermal X-ray emission of Cassiopeia A**, Emanuele Greco et.al., [2308.15956v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15956v1)

 Synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons is usually invoked as the responsible for the nonthermal emission observed in Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is the most popular mechanism to explain the process of particles acceleration and within its framework a crucial role is played by the turbulent magnetic-field. However, the standard models commonly used to fit X-ray synchrotron emission do not take into account the effects of turbulence in the shape of the resulting photon spectra. An alternative mechanism that properly includes such effects is the jitter radiation, that provides for an additional power-law beyond the classical synchrotron cutoff. We fitted a jitter spectral model to Chandra, NuSTAR, SWIFT/BAT and INTEGRAL/ISGRI spectra of Cassiopeia A and found that it describes the X-ray soft-to-hard range better than any of the standard cutoff models. The jitter radiation allows us to measure the index of the magnetic turbulence spectrum $\nu\_B$ and the minimum scale of the turbulence $\lambda\_{\rm{min}}$ across several regions of Cas A, with best-fit values $\nu\_B \sim 2-2.4$ and $\lambda\_{\rm{min}} \lesssim 100$ km.

2023-08-30, **Metal Enrichment due to Embedded Stars in AGN Discs**, Jiamu Huang et.al., [2308.15761v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15761v1)

 We separately assess elemental abundances in AGNs' broad and narrow emission line regions (BLR and NLR), based on a critical assessment of published results together with new photoionization models. We find 1) He/H enhancements in some AGN, exceeding what can be explained by normal chemical evolution and confirm 2) super-solar {\alpha} abundance, though to a lesser degree than previously reported. We also reaffirm 3) a N/O ratio consistent with secondary production; 4) solar or slightly sub-solar Fe abundance; and 5) red-shift independent metallicity, in contrast with galactic chemical evolution. We interpret 6) the larger metallicity in the BLR than NRL in terms of an in situ stellar evolution and pollution in AGN discs (SEPAD) model. We attribute: a) the redshift independence to the heavy element pollutants being disposed into the disc and accreted onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH); b) the limited He excess to the accretion-wind metabolism of a top-heavy population of evolving massive main sequence stars; c) the super-solar CNO enrichment to the nuclear synthesis during their post-main-sequence evolution; d) the large N/O to the byproduct of multiple stellar generations; and e) the Mg, Si, and Fe to the ejecta of type II supernovae in the disc. These results provide supporting evidence for f) ongoing self-regulated star formation, g) adequate stellar luminosity to maintain marginal gravitational stability, h) prolific production of seeds and i) dense coexistence of subsequently-grown residual black hole populations in AGN discs.

2023-08-30, **Measurements of the Hubble constant from combinations of supernovae and radio quasars**, Tonghua Liu et.al., [2308.15731v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15731v1)

 In this letter, we propose an improved cosmological model independent method of determining the value of the Hubble constant $H\_0$. The method uses unanchored luminosity distances $H\_0d\_L(z)$ from SN Ia Pantheon data combined with angular diameter distances $d\_A(z)$ from a sample of intermediate luminosity radio quasars calibrated as standard rulers. The distance duality relation between $d\_L(z)$ and $d\_A(z)$, which is robust and independent of any cosmological model, allows to disentangle $H\_0$ from such combination. However, the number of redshift matched quasars and SN Ia pairs is small (37 data-points). Hence, we take an advantage from the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method to recover the $d\_A(z)$ relation from a network trained on full 120 radio quasar sample. In this case, the result is unambiguously consistent with values of $H\_0$ obtained from local probes by SH0ES and H0LiCOW collaborations. Three statistical summary measures: weighted mean $\widetilde{H}\_0=73.51(\pm0.67) {~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, median $Med(H\_0)=74.71(\pm4.08) {~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ and MCMC simulated posterior distribution $H\_0=73.52^{+0.66}\_{-0.68} {~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ are fully consistent with each other and the precision reached $1\%$ level. This is encouraging for the future applications of our method. Because individual measurements of $H\_0$ are related to different redshifts spanning the range $z=0.5 - 2.0$, we take advantage of this fact to check if there is any noticeable trend in $H\_0$ measurements with redshift of objects used for this purpose. However, our result is that the data we used strongly support the lack of such systematic effects.

2023-08-29, **Searching for TeV emission from LHAASO J0341+5258 with VERITAS and HAWC**, P. Bangale et.al., [2308.15643v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15643v1)

 Galactic PeVatrons are astrophysical sources accelerating particles up to a few PeV ($\sim$10$^{15}$ eV) energies. The primary signature of 100 TeV $\gamma$ rays may come from PeV protons or multi-hundred TeV (not PeV) electrons. The search for PeVatrons has been one of the key science topics for VERITAS and HAWC. In 2021, LHAASO detected 14 steady $\gamma$-ray sources with photon energies above 100 TeV, up to 1.4 PeV. This provides a clear list of PeVatron candidates for further study with VERITAS and HAWC. Most of these sources contain possible source associations, such as supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, and stellar clusters. However, two sources: LHAASO J2108+5157 and LHAASO J0341+5258, do not have any such counterparts. Therefore, multiwavelength observations are required to identify the objects responsible for the UHE $\gamma$ rays, to understand the source morphology and association, and to shed light on the emission processes. Here, we will present the status of VERITAS/HAWC observations and results for the LHAASO PeVatron candidate J0341+5258, and also discuss the VERITAS PeVatron search in general.

2023-08-29, **Rapid Chemical Enrichment by Intermittent Star Formation in GN-z11**, Chiaki Kobayashi et.al., [2308.15583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15583v1)

 We interpret the peculiar super-solar nitrogen abundance recently reported by the James Webb Space Telescope observations for GN-z11 (z=10.6) using our state-of-the-art chemical evolution models. The observed CNO ratios can be successfully reproduced -- independently of the adopted initial mass function, nucleosynthesis yields and presence of supermassive ($>$1000$M\_\odot$) stars -- if the galaxy has undergone an intermittent star formation history with a quiescent phase lasting $\sim$100 Myr, separating two strong star bursts. Immediately after the second burst, Wolf-Rayet stars (up to $120M\_\odot$) become the dominant enrichment source, also temporarily ($<$1 Myr) enhancing particular elements (N, F, Na, Al) and isotopes ($^{13}$C, $^{18}$O). Alternative explanations involving (i) single burst models, also including very massive stars and/or pair-instability supernovae, or (ii) pre-enrichment scenarios fail to match the data. Feedback-regulated, intermittent star formation might be common in early systems. Elemental abundances can be used to test this hypothesis, and to get new insights on nuclear and stellar astrophysics.

2023-08-29, **Estimating Ejecta Mass Ratios in Kepler's SNR: Global X-Ray Spectral Analysis Including Suzaku Systematics and Emitting Volume Uncertainties**, Tyler Holland-Ashford et.al., [2308.15527v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15527v1)

 The exact origins of many Type Ia supernovae$\unicode{x2013}$progenitor scenarios and explosive mechanisms$\unicode{x2013}$remain uncertain. In this work, we analyze the global Suzaku X-Ray spectrum of Kepler's supernova remnant in order to constrain mass ratios of various ejecta species synthesized during explosion. Critically, we account for the Suzaku telescope effective area calibration uncertainties of 5$\unicode{x2013}$20% by generating 100 mock effective area curves and using Markov Chain Monte Carlo based spectral fitting to produce 100 sets of best-fit parameter values. Additionally, we characterize the uncertainties from assumptions made about the emitting volumes of each model plasma component: finding that these uncertainties can be the dominant source of error. We then compare our calculated mass ratios to previous observational studies of Kepler's SNR and to the predictions of SN Ia simulations. Our mass ratio estimates require a $\sim$90% attenuated $^{12}$C$+^{16}$O reaction rate and are potentially consistent with both near- and sub-M$\_{\rm Ch}$ progenitors, but are inconsistent with the dynamically stable double detonation origin scenario and only marginally consistent with the dynamically unstable dynamically-driven double-degenerate double detonation (D$^6$) scenario.

2023-08-29, **A Model for Type-IIP Supernovae with Medium Recombination Approximation**, Hong-Xuan Jiang et.al., [2308.14967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14967v1)

 In this paper, we propose a new light-curve model for Type-IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) with an approximation of medium recombination. Recombination of hydrogen that takes place in the envelope is believed highly affect the light curves of SNe IIP. The propagation of the recombination wave through the expanding envelope is crucial to determine the temperature and the bolometric luminosity. Several approximations were made in previous works to determine the recombination front, which plays a role as the pseudo-photosphere. With the Eddington boundary condition, we let the actual photosphere be the boundary to determine the time evolution of temperature profile of the envelope and calculate the bolometric luminosity. A new approximation on the speed of recombination wave is introduced to get a closer result to the real situation. We abandon the non-self-consistent approximations made in former works and solve the initial hump problem in the previous attempt for the slow recombination approximation. The produced light curves show the necessity of this approximation and fit the observation well.
