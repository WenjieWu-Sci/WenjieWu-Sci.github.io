2023-09-26, **Singlet-doublet Dirac fermion dark matter from Peccei-Quinn symmetry**, Robinson Longas et.al., [2309.15052v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15052v1)

 Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions are arguably the most compelling dark matter (DM) candidates in the literature. Here, we consider a model where the PQ symmetry solves the strong CP problem, generates radiatively Dirac neutrino masses, and gives origin to multicomponent dark sector. Specifically, scotogenic Dirac neutrino masses arise at one-loop level. The lightest fermionic mediator acts as the second DM candidate due to a residual $Z\_2$ symmetry resulting from the PQ symmetry breaking. The WIMP DM component resembles the well-known singlet-doublet fermion DM. While the lower WIMP dark mass region is usually excluded, our model reopens that portion of the parameter space (for DM masses below $\lesssim 100$ GeV). Therefore, we perform a phenomenological analysis that addresses the constraints from direct searches of DM, neutrino oscillation data, and charged lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes. The model can be tested in future facilities where DM annihilation into SM particles is searched for by neutrino telescopes.

 Supernovae provide fascinating opportunities to study various particles and their interactions. Among these there are neutrinos, axions, and other light weakly interacting particles, which play a significant role in our understanding of fundamental physics. In this study, the focus lies on the recent advancements made in characterizing axion emission from nuclear matter within the context of supernovae. The main production mechanisms for axions coupled with nucleons, bremsstrahlung and pion-axion conversion, are extensively discussed. These findings shed light on the behavior of axions in dense and hot nuclear matter, encountered in these extreme astrophysical environments.

 We present recent results of the TELAMON program, which is using the Effelsberg 100-m telescope to monitor the radio spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) under scrutiny in astroparticle physics, namely TeV blazars and neutrino-associated AGN. Our sample includes all known Northern TeV-emitting blazars as well as blazars positionally coincident with IceCube neutrino alerts. Polarization can give additional insight into the source properties, as the polarized emission is often found to vary on different timescales and amplitudes than the total intensity emission. Here, we present an overview of the polarization properties of the TeV-emitting TELAMON sources at four frequencies in the 20 mm and 7 mm bands. While at 7 mm roughly $82\,\%$ of all observed sources are found to be significantly polarized, for 20 mm the percentage is $\sim58\,\%$. We find that most of the sources exhibit mean fractional polarizations of $<5\%$, matching the expectations of rather low polarization levels in these sources from previous studies at lower radio frequencies. Nevertheless, we demonstrate examples of how the polarized emission can provide additional information over the total intensity.

2023-09-26, **Unveiling Neutrino Mysteries with $Δ(27)$ Symmetry**, Manash Dey et.al., [2309.14769v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14769v1)

 In the realm of neutrino physics, we grapple with mysteries like the origin of neutrino masses, the absence of a clear mass hierarchy, and the values of Majorana phases. To address these puzzles, we extend the Standard Model using $\Delta(27)$ symmetry within the Hybrid seesaw framework. We also introduce an additional $Z\_{10}$ symmetry to constrain some undesirable terms in the Yukawa Lagrangian, resulting in a unique neutrino mass matrix texture with partial $\mu-\tau$ symmetry. In our study, we propose a novel lepton mixing matrix that, when connected to this texture, provides valuable phenomenological insights.

2023-09-26, **One-loop Matching of the Type-III Seesaw Model onto the Standard Model Effective Field Theory**, Xu Li et.al., [2309.14702v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14702v1)

 In previous works arXiv:2107.12133 and arXiv:2201.05082, we have performed the one-loop matching of both type-I and type-II seesaw models for neutrino masses onto the Standard Model Effective Field Theories (SMEFT). In the present paper, by matching the type-III seesaw model onto the SMEFT at the one-loop level, we complete this series of studies on the construction of low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) for the canonical seesaw models. After integrating out the heavy fermionic triplets in the type-III seesaw model via both functional and diagrammatic approaches, we find 33 dimension-six (dim-6) operators in the Warsaw basis and their Wilson coefficients, while the number of dim-6 operators is 31 (or 41) for the EFT of type-I (or type-II) seesaw model. Furthermore, we calculate the branching ratios of radiative decays of charged leptons in the EFT. Then, the relationship between the beta function of the quartic Higgs coupling $\lambda$ in the full theory and that of $\lambda^{}\_{\rm EFT}$ in the EFT is clarified. Finally, we briefly discuss the phenomenological implications of three types of seesaw EFTs and propose working observables that are sensitive to the four-fermion operators, which could be used to distinguish among different seesaw models in collider experiments.

2023-09-25, **POEMMA (Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics) Roadmap Update**, Angela V. Olinto et.al., [2309.14561v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14561v1)

 The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) was designed as a NASA Astrophysics probe-class mission to identify the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and observe cosmic neutrinos from extremely energetic transient sources. POEMMA consists of two identical spacecraft flying in a loose formation at 525 km altitude oriented to view a common atmospheric volume and to provide full-sky coverage for both types of messengers. Each spacecraft hosts a wide field of view Schmidt telescope with a hybrid focal plane optimized to observe both the UV fluorescence signal from extensive air showers (EASs) and the optical Cherenkov signals from EASs. When in stereo close to nadir mode, POEMMA can measure the spectrum, composition, and full-sky distribution of the UHECRs above 20 EeV and be sensitive to UHE neutrinos. When pointing just below the Earth's limb, POEMMA will be sensitive to cosmic tau neutrinos above 20 PeV by observing the Cherenkov radiation of EASs produced by upward-moving tau decays, induced from tau neutrino interactions in the Earth. POEMMA is designed to quickly re-orient to follow a Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) neutrino transient from astrophysical sources with exceptional sensitivity to neutrinos from both short-duration transients, such as short-gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), and long-duration sources, such as binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Here we review the POEMMA mission and discuss the recent progress towards its technical readiness provided by the Mini-EUSO and EUSO-SPB2 missions and the forthcoming Terzina and POEMMA-Balloon-Radio missions

2023-09-25, **Rare tau decays via exchange of on-shell almost degenerate Majorana neutrinos, $τ^{\mp} \to π^{\mp} N_j \to π^{\mp} μ^{\mp} π^{\pm}$ and $τ^{\mp} \to π^{\mp} N_j \to π^{\mp} μ^{\pm} π^{\mp}$**, Gorazd Cvetic et.al., [2309.14281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14281v1)

 We investigate rare decays of tau leptons that occur via exchange of heavy on-shell neutrinos $N\_j$ ($j=1,2$). These neutrinos can be either Dirac or Majorana, and are considered to be almost degenerate in mass. The decays can thus be either lepton number conserving (LNC), $\tau^{\mp} \to \pi^{\mp} N\_j \to \pi^{\mp} \mu^{\mp} \pi^{\pm}$, or lepton number violating (LNV), $\tau^{\mp} \to \pi^{\mp} N\_j \to \pi^{\mp} \mu^{\pm} \pi^{\mp}$. If neutrinos are Dirac, only LNC decays are possible. If they are Majorana, both LNC and LNV are possible. We derive the corresponding expressions for the effective decay widths $\Gamma\_{{\rm eff},\mp}^{\rm (X)}$ (X=LNC, LNV) of these rare decays, where we account for $N\_1$-$N\_2$ overlap and oscillation effects and for the finite detector length effects. We then numerically evaluate these decay widths as well as the related CP violation asymmetry width $\Delta \Gamma\_{\rm CP}^{\rm (X)} = (\Gamma\_{{\rm eff},-}^{\rm (X)} - \Gamma\_{{\rm eff},+}^{\rm (X)})$. We conclude that for certain, presently allowed, ranges of the heavy-light neutrino mixing parameters, such decays and asymmetries could be observed in Belle II experiment.

2023-09-25, **Gravitational production of matter and radiation during reheating**, Simon Cléry et.al., [2309.14264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14264v1)

 I present the production of matter and radiation during reheating after inflation, considering only gravitational interactions between the inflaton background and the other sectors. Processes considered are the following: i) the exchange of a graviton, $h\_{\mu \nu}$, involved in the scattering of the inflaton or particles in the newly created radiation bath; ii) scattering of the inflaton background and particles in the radiation bath including the effects of non-minimal couplings to curvature of the Higgs boson and the inflaton. Requiring the existence of heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHN), I show that a minimal scenario utilizing only these "gravitational portals" is able to generate simultaneously the observed relic density of Dark Matter (DM), the baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis, as well as a sufficiently hot thermal bath after inflation, for generic models of large field inflation.

2023-09-25, **Texture zeros realization in a three-loop radiative neutrino mass model from modular $A_4$ symmetry**, Takaaki Nomura et.al., [2309.13921v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13921v1)

 We derive verifiable two-zero textures in the framework of a three-loop induced neutrino mass model applying a modular $A\_4$ symmetry for the lepton sector. Interestingly, the neutrino mass structure is determined by assignments of the right-handed charged-lepton particles only. We show all the possible texture patterns and demonstrate their analytical and numerical analyses. Finally, we mention a possibility of detection for doubly-charged boson via colliders that decays into specific modes due to the flavor symmetry.

2023-09-25, **Modern Software Development for JUNO offline software**, Tao Lin et.al., [2309.13780v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13780v1)

 The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), under construction in South China, primarily aims to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and to precise measure the neutrino oscillation parameters. The data-taking is expected to start in 2024 and the detector plans to run for more than 20 years. The development of the JUNO offline software (JUNOSW) started in 2012, and it is quite challenging to maintain the JUNOSW for such a long time. In the last ten years, tools such as Subversion, Trac, and CMT had been adopted for software development. However, new stringent requirements came out, such as how to reduce the building time for the whole project, how to deploy offline algorithms to an online environment, and how to improve the code quality with code review and continuous integration. To meet the further requirements of software development, modern development tools are evaluated for JUNOSW, such as Git, GitLab, CMake, Docker, and Kubernetes. This contribution will present the software development system based on these modern tools for JUNOSW and the functionalities achieved: CMake macros are developed to simplify the build instructions for users; CMake generator expressions are used to control the build flags for the online and offline environments; a tool named git-junoenv is developed to help users partially checkout and build the software; a script is used to build and deploy the software on the CVMFS server; a Docker image with CVMFS client installed is created for continuous integration; a GitLab agent is set up to manage GitLab runners in Kubernetes with all the configurations in a GitLab repository.

2023-09-26, **Probing light relics through cosmic dawn**, Nanoom Lee et.al., [2309.15119v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15119v1)

 We explore the prospects of upcoming 21-cm surveys of cosmic dawn ($12\lesssim \!z\lesssim\!30$) to provide cosmological information on top of upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure surveys, such as CMB-S4, Simons Observatory (SO) and DESI. We focus on the effective number of relativistic species $N\_{\rm eff}$ which is a promising observable for probing beyond the Standard Model theories. We show including upcoming 21-cm surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) can allow probing a wide range of models for light particles at $2\sigma$ level achieving $2\sigma(N\_{\rm eff})=0.034$ with CMB-S4, for example. Taking into account the degeneracy between $N\_{\rm eff}$ and primordial helium fraction $Y\_p$, one can achieve improvements in sensitivities to cosmological parameters, in particular, by more than a factor of 2 for $N\_{\rm eff}$ and dark matter fractional energy density $\omega\_c$.

2023-09-26, **Improved constraints for axion-like particles from 3-photon events at $e^+e^-$ colliders**, Aleksandr Pustyntsev et.al., [2309.15106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15106v1)

 Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are one of the most widely discussed extensions of the Standard Model when it comes to the strong CP problem and dark matter candidates. Current experiments are focused on the indirect searches of invisible pseudoscalars in a wide parameter range. In this paper we investigate limits on ALP mass, and its couplings to photons and leptons from 3-photon annihilation at $e^+e^-$ colliders. We provide detailed calculations and apply them to the particular kinematics of the Belle II experiment, covering the ALP mass range from few hundred MeV to around 10 GeV. Our results, which improve upon previous analyses by also including the ALP coupling to electrons, show that such future analyses will allow to significantly extend the ALP search range and impose much more stringent restrictions on their couplings.

2023-09-26, **Formation of the hydrogen line 21-cm in Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn: dependences on cosmology and first light**, Bohdan Novosyadlyj et.al., [2309.15092v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15092v1)

 We analyze the formation of the redshifted hyperfine structure line 21-cm of hydrogen atom in the Dark Ages, Cosmic Dawn, and Reionization epochs. The evolution of the global differential brightness temperature in this line was computed to study its dependence on the values of cosmological parameters and physical conditions in the intergalactic medium. Variations of the depth of the Dark Ages absorption line at $z\sim80$ with variations of the cosmological parameters $\Omega\_b$, $\Omega\_{cdm}$, $\Omega\_{\Lambda}$, $\Omega\_K$ and $H\_0$ are studied. The standard model with post-Planck parameters predicts a value of the differential brightness temperature in the center of the absorption line $\sim$30-50 mK. The profile of this line can be quite another in the non-standard cosmological models, which include the annihilating or decaying dark matter, a primordial stochastic magnetic field, etc. It can be shallower or be an emission bump instead of an absorption trough. It is also shown that the position and depth of the Cosmic Dawn absorption line formed at 10<z<30, due to the Wouthuysen-Field effect, is mainly defined by the spectral energy distribution of the first sources of light. If reionization occurs at $z\_{ri}=7\pm1$, then the differential brightness temperature in the center of this line is $\sim$80 mK. During the reionization, the emission with an amplitude of $\sim$20 mK is possible. It is also shown that the temperature, density, and degree of ionization of the baryonic component are decisive in calculating the intensity of the 21-cm absorption/emission line from these epochs.

2023-09-26, **Quantum Cosmology and Black Hole Interiors in Nonsupersymmetric String Theory and Canonical Gravity**, Michael McGuigan et.al., [2309.15021v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15021v1)

 In this paper we study black hole interior solutions and cosmologies in different dimensions using tools from canonical gravity and nonsupersymmetric string quantum cosmology. We find that the quantum wave functions associated with these solutions can be related to each other by a specific choice of variables. In a more realistic four dimensional setting we combine canonical gravity and nonsupersymmetric string orbifold compactifications. We discuss the classical solutions and the corresponding wave functions involving inflation, the Higgs field, dark matter and hidden gauge sectors in these models. Finally we discuss string aspects of these models such as duality, massive modes, and nonperturbative approaches such as Matrix theory and holography near the singularity.

2023-09-26, **Experimental Limits on Solar Reflected Dark Matter with a New Approach on Accelerated Dark Matter-Electron Analysis in Semiconductors**, Z. Y. Zhang et.al., [2309.14982v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14982v1)

 Recently a Dark Matter-electron (DM-e) paradigm has drawn much attention. Models beyond the Standard Halo Model describing DM accelerated by high energy celestial bodies are under intense examination as well. In this letter, a Velocity Component Analysis method dedicated to swift analysis of Accelerated DM-electron interactions via semiconductor detectors is proposed and the first HPGe detector-based Accelerated DM-electron analysis is realized. Utilizing the method, the first germanium based constraint on sub-GeV Solar Reflected DM-electron interaction is presented with the 205.4 kg$\cdot$day dataset from the CDEX-10 experiment. In the heavy mediator scenario, the result excels in the mass range from 5$-$15 keV/$c^2$, achieving a three orders of magnitude improvement comparing with previous semiconductor experiments, and is comparable to currently the best direct detection experiments. In the light mediator scenario, the strongest constraint for DM lighter than 0.1 MeV/$c^2$ is presented. The result proves the feasibility and demonstrates the vast potential of the Velocity Component Analysis technique in future Accelerated DM-electron analysis with semiconductor detectors.

2023-09-26, **Baryonium Dark Matter: Events with Circle Configurations in the Atmosphere and on the Surface of Earth**, O. I. Piskounova et.al., [2309.14933v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14933v1)

 This research supposes the parallel study of Baryonium Dark Matter (BDM) manifestations in astroparticle collision in the atmosphere as well as among the traces of the massive object that falls on the surface of Earth. Characteristics of BDM disintegration events are able to be analyzed with a similar technique as for hadroproproduction data on colliders. The HE event that was detected in the stratosphere in 1975 differs from the collision of nuclei. The signatures of such events are the following: 1) the circle distribution of heavy secondary hadrons with almost nothing inside the ring and 2) the presence of heavy secondary particles with a mass out of range of known hadrons. The circle signature can have the BDM particles that disintegrate for a few lower-mass BDMs in the atmosphere. The same signatures should be seen at super-heavy BDM collapses on the Earth. The traces of such events are seen as pits or shafts in the ground rock, which are organized in the circles. There are at least two pieces of evidence of such holes: cenotes on the Yucatan peninsula (Mexico) and pits in Durrington Walls (England). In addition, a single round hole in the ground can be seen in Moschovi in the Balkans, where it has been reused for the grave. The vertical pits in the rock with the depth from 5 to 50 meters had been laid out in the circles. These super heavy BDM collapses differ from the meteorite crash, because there are no craters. The existence of these places around the globe indicates the rare likelihood of meeting the supermassive BDM in proximity to Earth. The Tunguska meteorite could also be a BDM collapse. Finally, some suggestions are made about the production of BDM with the jets from giant active Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) in the Universe.

2023-09-26, **Black hole charges in dark matter haloes and the seeds of cosmic magnetic fields**, Nelson D. Padilla et.al., [2309.14929v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14929v1)

 We present improved estimates of the electric charge that black holes could hold when these are embedded in the ionised plasma within dark matter haloes (or galaxies) in the Universe. We have implemented the spontaneous emission of charges of opposite sign to that of the black hole via athermal Hawking evaporation, including its dependence on black hole spin, and we have estimated the equilibrium charge that arises as this charge loss is balanced by the continuous accretion of charges from the surrounding plasma. The resulting charge can be several orders of magnitude lower than previously estimated upper limits, but it can surpass the pair production limit noted by Gibbons (1974) by a margin that increases with the amplitude of the black hole spin and the density of the plasma. We also implement a calculation for the net charge and magnetic moment of dark matter haloes when the dark matter is made of primordial black holes and also for astrophysical black holes that form part of the stellar halo of galaxies. We calculate the resulting magnetic fields of $z=15$ haloes for these different cases, and show that both primordial black holes and stellar ones could provide the magnetic field that can seed the observed ones in present-day galaxies.

2023-09-26, **Symmetric teleparallel cosmology with boundary corrections**, Andronikos Paliathanasis et.al., [2309.14669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14669v1)

 We investigate the geometrodynamical effects of introducing the boundary term in symmetric teleparallel gravity. Specifically, we consider a homogeneous and isotropic universe in $f\left( Q, B \right) $, where $Q$ is the non-metricity scalar, and $B$ is the boundary term that relates the non-metricity and Ricci scalars. For the connection in the coincidence gauge, we find that the field equations are of fourth-order, and the fluid components introduced by the boundary are attributed to a scalar field. In the coincidence gauge, the cosmological field equations are equivalent to those of teleparallelism with a boundary term. Nevertheless, for the connection defined in the non-coincidence gauge, the geometrodynamical fluid consists of three scalar fields. We focus on the special case of $f\left( Q, B \right) = Q + F\left( B \right) $ theory, and we determine a new analytic cosmological solution that can explain the late-time acceleration of the universe and provide a geometric mechanism for the unification of dark energy with dark matter.

2023-09-25, **Characterising ultra-high-redshift dark matter halo demographics and assembly histories with the GUREFT simulations**, L. Y. Aaron Yung et.al., [2309.14408v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14408v1)

 Dark matter halo demographics and assembly histories are a manifestation of cosmological structure formation and have profound implications for the formation and evolution of galaxies. In particular, merger trees provide fundamental input for several modelling techniques, such as semi-analytic models (SAMs), sub-halo abundance matching (SHAM), and decorated halo occupation distribution models (HODs). Motivated by the new ultra-high-redshift (z > 10) frontier enabled by JWST, we present a new suite of Gadget at Ultrahigh Redshift with Extra-Fine Timesteps (GUREFT) dark matter-only cosmological simulations that are carefully designed to capture halo merger histories and structural properties in the ultra-z universe. The simulation suite consists of four 1024^3-particle simulations with box sizes of 5, 15, 35, and 90 Mpc h-1, each with 170 snapshots stored between 40 > z > 6. With the unprecedented number of available snapshots and strategically chosen dynamic range covered by these boxes, gureft uncovers the emerging dark matter halo populations and their assembly histories in the earliest epochs of cosmic history. In this work, we present the halo mass functions between z ~ 20 to 6 down to log(Mvir/Msun) ~ 5, and show that at high redshift, these robust halo mass functions can differ substantially from commonly used analytic approximations or older fitting functions in the literature. We also present key physical properties of the ultra-z halo population, such as concentration and spin, as well as their mass growth and merger rates, and again provide updated fitting functions.

 MOND theory has arisen as a promising alternative to dark matter in explaining the collection of discrepancies that constitute the so-called missing mass problem. The MOND paradigm is briefly reviewed. It is shown that MOND theory can be incorporated into the framework of Matrix General Relativity. In particular, we demonstrate that Matrix General Relativity contains MOND as a particular case.

2023-09-25, **Primary scintillation yield in gaseous Xe for electrons and alpha-particles**, C. A. O. Henriques et.al., [2309.14202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14202v1)

 Xenon scintillation has been widely used in rare event detection experiments, such as in neutrinoless double beta decay, double electron capture and dark matter searches. Nonetheless, experimental values for primary scintillation yield in gaseous xenon (GXe) remain scarce and dispersed. The mean energy required to produce a scintillation photon, w\_sc in GXe in the absence of recombination has been measured to be in the range of 34-111 eV. Lower w\_sc-values are often reported for alpha-particles when compared to electrons produced by gamma- or x-rays, being this difference not understood. We carried out a systematic study on the absolute primary scintillation yield in GXe under reduced electric fields in the 70-300 V/cm/bar range and near atmospheric pressure, 1.2 bar, supported by a robust geometrical efficiency simulation model.   Neglecting the 3rd continuum emission, a mean w\_sc-value of 38.7 [+- 0.6 (sta.)] [(- 7.2) (+ 7.7) (sys.)] eV was obtained for x/gamma-rays in the 5.9-60 keV energy range and alpha-particles in the 1.5-2.5 MeV range, no significant dependency neither on radiation type nor on energy has been observed. If the Xe 3rd continuum emission is to be considered, the average energy to produce a 2nd and a 3rd continuum photon was calculated as w\_2nd = 43.5 [+- 0.7 (sta.)][(- 8.1)(+ 8.7) (sys.)] eV and w\_3rd = 483 [+- 7 (sta.)][(- 105)(+ 110) (sys.)] eV, respectively, while the energy to produce either a 3rd or a 2nd continuum photon is w\_(2nd + 3rd) = 39.9 [+- 0.6 (sta.)] [(- 7.4) (+ 8.0) (sys.)] eV.   Our experimental w\_sc-values agree with both state-of-art simulations and literature data obtained for alpha-particles. The discrepancy between our results and the experimental values found in the literature for x/gamma-rays is discussed and attributed to undressed large systematic errors in previous studies.

2023-09-25, **Observational constraints on interactions between dark energy and dark matter with momentum and energy transfers**, Xiaolin Liu et.al., [2309.13946v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13946v1)

 We place observational constraints on a dark energy (DE) model in which a quintessence scalar field $\phi$ is coupled to dark matter (DM) through momentum and energy exchanges. The momentum transfer is weighed by an interaction between the field derivative and DM four velocity with a coupling constant $\beta$, whereas the energy exchange is characterized by an exponential scalar-field coupling to the DM density with a coupling constant $Q$. A positive coupling $\beta$ leads to the suppression for the growth of DM density perturbations at low redshifts, whose property offers a possibility for resolving the $\sigma\_8$ tension problem. A negative coupling $Q$ gives rise to a $\phi$-matter-dominated epoch, whose presence can reduce the sound horizon around the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) decoupling epoch. Using the data of Planck 2018, 12-th Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Phantheon supernovae samples, and 1-year dark energy survey, we find that the two couplings are constrained to be $\beta=0.417^{+1.592}\_{-0.307}$ and $Q =-0.036^{+0.036}\_{-0.010}$ at 68\,\% confidence level (CL). Thus, there is an interesting observational signature of the momentum exchange ($\beta \neq 0$) between DE and DM, with a peak of the probability distribution of the energy transfer coupling at $Q<0$.

 The dark matter observation claim by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration has been a long-standing puzzle within the particle physics community. Efforts of other research groups to verify the claim have been insufficient by significant radioactivity of present NaI(Tl) crystals. PICOLON (Pure Inorganic Crystal Observatory for LOw-energy Neut(ra)lino) experiment conducts independent search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) using NaI(Tl) crystals. Our NaI(Tl) crystal manufactured in 2020 (Ingot #85) reached the same purity level as DAMA/LIBRA crystals. In this report, we describe the radiopurity of the new Ingot #94 crystal produced using the same purification technique as Ingot #85. The $\alpha$-ray events were selected by pulse-shape discrimination method. The impurities in the Ingot #94, $^{232}$Th, $^{226}$Ra and $^{210}$Po radioactivity were $4.6\pm 1.2~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, $7.9\pm 4.4~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, and $19\pm 6~\mathrm{\mu Bq/kg}$, which are equivalent to those of the DAMA/LIBRA crystals. The background rate in the energy region of 2-6 keV , was 2-5 events/d/kg/keV without applying a veto trigger.

 Directional methods have been considered to provide a solid proof for the direct detection of the dark matter. Gaseous time-projection-chambers (TPCs) are the most mature devices for directional dark matter searches although there still exist several challenges to overcome. This paper reviews the history, current challenges and future prospects of the gaseous TPCs for directional dark matter searches.

 I analyze a new X-ray image of the youngest supernova remnant (SNR) in the Galaxy, which is the type Ia SNR G1.9+0.3, and reveal a very clear point-symmetrical structure. Since explosion models of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) do not form such morphologies, the point-symmetrical morphology must come from the circumstellar material (CSM) into which the ejecta expands. The large-scale point-symmetry that I identify and the known substantial deceleration of the ejecta of SNR G1.9+0.3 suggest a relatively massive CSM of >1Mo. I argue that the most likely explanation is the explosion of this SN Ia into a planetary nebula (PN). The scenario that predicts a large fraction of SN Ia inside PNe (SNIPs) is the core degenerate scenario. Other SN Ia scenarios might lead to only a very small fraction of SNIPs or not at all.

2023-09-26, **Rayleigh-Taylor Unstable Flames: the Coupled Effect of Multiple Perturbations**, Mingxuan Liu et.al., [2309.15046v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15046v1)

 The Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability is important in the fields of aerospace engineering, nuclear physics, and astrophysical research, particularly in studies of Type Ia supernovae. In some applications, the RT instability is complicated by a reaction at the unstable interface. In this paper, we show how this reaction changes the behavior of the RT instability. Using 2D direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Boussinesq premixed flames with a model reaction rate, we show how the flame responds to three types of perturbation: a large amplitude single mode primary perturbation, a smaller amplitude single mode secondary perturbation, and a numerically generated system perturbation with both single mode and multimode components. Early on, the evolution of the flame is dominated by the primary perturbation and, differently from single mode nonreacting RT, the flame propagates as a metastable traveling wave in the form of bubbles separated by cusp-like spikes. However, the lifetime of this traveling wave depends on the properties of the secondary and system perturbations and on the strength of gravity. Once the traveling wave is destabilized, the flame front bubbles rapidly grow to large scales. We identify five distinct flame growth solution types, with the symmetry and properties of each depending on the balance and interactions between the three types of perturbation. In particular, we show that the primary and secondary modes can couple to generate a tertiary mode which ultimately dominates the flow. Depending on the wavenumber of the tertiary mode, the flame may stall, develop coherent pulsations, or even become a metastable traveling wave again, behaviors not seen in nonreacting RT.

 We present results from a systematic search for broad ($\geq$ 400 \kms) \ha\ emission in Integral Field Spectroscopy data cubes of $\sim$1200 nearby galaxies obtained with PMAS and MUSE. We found 19 unique regions that pass our quality cuts, four of which match the locations of previously discovered SNe: one Type IIP, and three Type IIn, including the well-known SN 2005ip. We suggest that these objects are young Supernova Remnants, with bright and broad \ha\ emission powered by the interaction between the SN ejecta and dense circumstellar material. The stellar ages measured at the location of these SNR candidates are systematically lower by about 0.5 dex than those measured at the location of core collapse SNe, implying that their progenitors might be shorter lived and therefore more massive than a typical CC SN progenitor. The methods laid out in this work open a new window into the study of nearby SNe with Integral Field Spectroscopy.

 In this work we delve into the temperature-dependent Equation of State (EoS) of baryonic matter within the framework of the FSU2H$^*$ hadronic model, which comprehensively incorporates hyperons and is suitable for relativistic simulations of neutron star mergers and supernovae. To assess the impact of the uncertainties in the hyperonic sector on astrophysical observables, we introduce two additional models, namely FSU2H$^*$L and FSU2H$^*$U. These models cover the entire spectrum of variability of hyperonic potentials, as derived from experimental data. Our investigations reveal that these uncertainties extend their influence not only to the relative abundances of various particle species but also to the EoS itself and, consequently, have an impact on the global properties of both cold and hot neutron stars. Notably, their effects become more pronounced at large temperatures, owing to the increased presence of hyperons. These findings have direct implications for the outcomes of relativistic simulations of neutron star mergers and supernovae, emphasizing the need of accounting for hyperonic uncertainties to ensure the accuracy and reliability of such simulations in astrophysical contexts.

 Astro-COLIBRI is an innovative tool designed for professional astronomers to facilitate the study of transient astronomical events. Transient events - such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and stellar mergers - are fleeting cataclysmic phenomena that can offer profound insights into the most violent processes in the universe. Revealing their secrets requires rapid and precise observations: Astro-COLIBRI alerts its users of new transient discoveries from observatories all over the world in real-time. The platform also provides observers the details they need to make follow-up observations.   Some of the transient phenomena available through Astro-COLIBRI are accessible by amateur astronomers and citizen scientists. A subset of the features dedicated to this growing group of users are highlighted here. They include the possibility of receiving only alerts on very bright events, the possibility of defining custom observer locations, as well as the calculation of optimized observation plans for searches for optical counterparts to gravitational wave events.

2023-09-26, **Expansion and ongoing cosmic ray acceleration in HESS J1731-347**, Victor Doroshenko et.al., [2309.14716v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14716v1)

 Diffusive shock acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) is considered one of the prime mechanisms for Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) acceleration. It is still unclear, however, whether SNRs can contribute to GCR spectrum up to the ``knee'' (1\,PeV) band as acceleration to such energies requires an efficient magnetic field amplification process around the shocks. The presence of such a process is challenging to test observationally. Here we report on the detection of fast variability of the X-ray synchrotron emission from the forward shock in the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, which implies the presence of a strong ($\sim$0.2\,mG) field exceeding background values and thus of effective field amplification. We also report a direct measurement of the high forward shock expansion velocity of 4000-5500\,km/s confirming that the SNR is expanding in a tenuous wind bubble blown by the SNR progenitor, is significantly younger (2.4-9\,kyr) than previously assumed by some authors, and only recently started interaction with the dense material outside the bubble. We finally conclude that there is strong evidence for ongoing hadronic CR acceleration in this SNR.

 We report the results of careful astrometric measurements of the Cannonball pulsar J0002+6216 carried out over three years using the High Sensitivity Array (HSA). We significantly refine the proper motion to $\mu=35.3\pm0.6$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and place new constraints on the distance, with the overall effect of lowering the velocity and increasing the inferred age to $47.60\pm0.80$ kyr. Although the pulsar is brought more in line with the standard natal kick distribution, this new velocity has implications for the morphology of the pulsar wind nebula that surrounds it, the density of the interstellar medium through which it travels, and the age of the supernova remnant (CTB 1) from which it originates.

2023-09-25, **Modeling cosmic acceleration with a generalized varying deceleration parameter**, M. Koussour et.al., [2309.14498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14498v1)

 Understanding the accelerating expansion of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern cosmology. In this paper, we investigate a cosmological model parametrized by a generalized variable deceleration parameter to elucidate the dynamics driving cosmic acceleration. By employing constraints from the latest observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), we assess the compatibility of the model with observational data. The chosen parametrization aligns with thermodynamic constraints on the deceleration parameter, further validating its reliability. Further, we estimate the present value of the Hubble parameter, transition redshift, deceleration parameter, and EoS parameter, which align with observational data. Lastly, our stability analysis confirms the model's stability against small perturbations.

 In this research paper, we explore a well-motivated parametrization of the time-dependent deceleration parameter, characterized by a cubic form, within the context of late time cosmic acceleration. The current analysis is based on the $f(Q,T)$ gravity theory, by considering the background metric as the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann Lema\^itre Robertson Walker (FLRW) metric. Investigating the model reveals intriguing features of the late universe. To constrain the model, we use the recent observational datasets, including cosmic chronometer (CC), Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB), Gamma Ray Burst (GRB), and Quasar (Q) datasets. The joint analysis of these datasets results in tighter constraints for the model parameters, enabling us to discuss both the physical and geometrical aspects of the model. Moreover, we determine the present values of the deceleration parameter ($q\_0$), the Hubble parameter ($H\_0$), and the transition redshift ($z\_t$) from deceleration to acceleration ensuring consistency with some recent results of Planck 2018. Our statistical analysis yields highly improved results, surpassing those obtained in previous investigations. Overall, this study presents valuable insights into the higher order $q(t)$ model and its implications for late-time cosmic acceleration, shedding light on the nature of the late universe.

2023-09-25, **Numerical studies on the link between radioisotopic signatures on Earth and the formation of the Local Bubble. II. Advanced modeling of interstellar 26Al, 53Mn, 60Fe, and 244Pu influxes as traces of past supernovae in the solar neighborhood**, Michael Mathias Schulreich et.al., [2309.13983v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13983v1)

 Measurements of long-lived radioisotopes provide a means, completely independent of other observational channels, to draw conclusions about near-Earth supernovae (SNe) and thus the origin of the Local Bubble (LB). First and foremost in this context is 60Fe, which has already been detected across the Earth and on the Moon. Using Gaia EDR3, we identified 14 SN explosions, with 13 occurring in UCL/LCC, and one in V1062 Sco, all being subgroups of the Sco-Cen OB association. The timing of these explosions was obtained by us through interpolation of rotating stellar evolution tracks via the initial masses of the already exploded massive stars. We further developed a new Monte Carlo-type approach for deriving the trajectories of the SN progenitors. We then performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations based on these initial conditions to explore the evolution of the LB in an inhomogeneous local interstellar medium and the transport of radioisotopes to Earth. The simulations include the stellar winds from the SN progenitors and additional radioisotopes (26Al, 53Mn, and 244Pu) besides 60Fe. We find that (i) our simulations are consistent with measurements of 60Fe, in particular, a peak 2-3 Myr before present, as well as 26Al, 53Mn, and 244Pu data, (ii) stellar winds contribute to the distribution of radioisotopes and also to the dynamics of the LB, (iii) the solar system (SS) entered the LB about 4.6 Myr ago, and (iv) the measured recent influx of 60Fe can be naturally explained by turbulent radioisotopic transport. Our simulations not only support the recent hypothesis that the LB triggered star formation in the solar vicinity through its expansion, but also suggest that the second, separate 60Fe peak measured at 6-9 Myr ago was generated by the passage of the SS through a neighboring superbubble (SB), possibly the Orion-Eridanus SB, prior to its current residence in the LB.

2023-09-25, **Observational constraints on interactions between dark energy and dark matter with momentum and energy transfers**, Xiaolin Liu et.al., [2309.13946v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13946v1)

 We place observational constraints on a dark energy (DE) model in which a quintessence scalar field $\phi$ is coupled to dark matter (DM) through momentum and energy exchanges. The momentum transfer is weighed by an interaction between the field derivative and DM four velocity with a coupling constant $\beta$, whereas the energy exchange is characterized by an exponential scalar-field coupling to the DM density with a coupling constant $Q$. A positive coupling $\beta$ leads to the suppression for the growth of DM density perturbations at low redshifts, whose property offers a possibility for resolving the $\sigma\_8$ tension problem. A negative coupling $Q$ gives rise to a $\phi$-matter-dominated epoch, whose presence can reduce the sound horizon around the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) decoupling epoch. Using the data of Planck 2018, 12-th Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Phantheon supernovae samples, and 1-year dark energy survey, we find that the two couplings are constrained to be $\beta=0.417^{+1.592}\_{-0.307}$ and $Q =-0.036^{+0.036}\_{-0.010}$ at 68\,\% confidence level (CL). Thus, there is an interesting observational signature of the momentum exchange ($\beta \neq 0$) between DE and DM, with a peak of the probability distribution of the energy transfer coupling at $Q<0$.

2023-09-25, **Pulsar Scintillation through Thick and Thin: Bow Shocks, Bubbles, and the Broader Interstellar Medium**, S. K. Ocker et.al., [2309.13809v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13809v1)

 Observations of pulsar scintillation are among the few astrophysical probes of very small-scale ($\lesssim$ au) phenomena in the interstellar medium (ISM). In particular, characterization of scintillation arcs, including their curvature and intensity distributions, can be related to interstellar turbulence and potentially over-pressurized plasma in local ISM inhomogeneities, such as supernova remnants, HII regions, and bow shocks. Here we present a survey of eight pulsars conducted at the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), revealing a diverse range of scintillation arc characteristics at high sensitivity. These observations reveal more arcs than measured previously for our sample. At least nine arcs are observed toward B1929$+$10 at screen distances spanning $\sim 90\%$ of the pulsar's $361$ pc path-length to the observer. Four arcs are observed toward B0355$+$54, with one arc yielding a screen distance as close as $\sim10^5$ au ($<1$ pc) from either the pulsar or the observer. Several pulsars show highly truncated, low-curvature arcs that may be attributable to scattering near the pulsar. The scattering screen constraints are synthesized with continuum maps of the local ISM and other well-characterized pulsar scintillation arcs, yielding a three-dimensional view of the scattering media in context.
