2024-03-20, **Approximate SU(5), Fine Structure Constants**, Holger Bech Nielsen et.al., [2403.14034v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14034v1)

 We fit the three finestructure constants of the Standard Model with three, in first approximation theoretically estimable parameters, 1) a "unifiedscale",turning out not equal to the Planck scale and thus only estimable by a very speculative story, 2) a "number of layers" being a priori the number of families, and 3) a unified coupling related to a critical coupling on a lattice. So formally we postdict the three fine structure constants! In the philosophy of our model there is a physically lattice theory with link variables taking values in a (or in the various) "small" representations of the Standard Model Group. We argue for that these representations functio in first approximation as were the theory a genuine $SU(5)$ theory. Next we take into account fluctuation of the gauge fields in the lattice and obtain a correction to the a priori $SU(5)$ approximation, because of course the link fluctuations not corresponding any Standard model Lie algebra, but only to the SU(5), do not exist. The model is a development of our old anti-grand-unification model having as its genuine gauge group, close to fundamental scale, a cross product of the standard model group S(U(3)x U(2)) with itself, there being one Cartesian product factor for each family. In these old works we included the hypotesis of "multiple point criticallity principle" which here effectively means the coupling constants be critical on the lattice. Counted relative to the Higgs scale we suggest the in our sense "unified scale" (where the deviations between the inverse fine structure constants deviate by quantum fluctuations being only from standard model groups, not SU(5)) makes up the 2/3 th power of the Planck scale relative to the Higgs scale, or better the top quark mass scale.

2024-03-20, **Constraining Neutrino Mixing Schemes with Correlations of Oscillation Data**, Biswajit Karmakar et.al., [2403.13966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13966v1)

 Correlations obtained from neutrino oscillation data on mixing parameters may help to validate neutrino mixing schemes. In this context, we explore how correlations of neutrino oscillation parameters affect the $\rm{TM}\_1$ and $\rm{TM}\_2$ mixing scenarios.

2024-03-20, **Signatures of Light New Particles in $B\to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$**, Patrick D. Bolton et.al., [2403.13887v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13887v1)

 The recent Belle II observation of $B \to K E\_{\rm miss}$ challenges theoretical interpretations in terms of Standard Model neutrino final states. Instead, we consider new physics scenarios where up to two new light-invisible particles of spin 0 up to 3/2 are present in the final state. We identify viable scenarios by reconstructing the (binned) likelihoods of the relevant $B \to K^{(*)} E\_{\rm miss}$ and also $B\_s \to E\_{\rm miss}$ experimental analyses and present preferred regions of couplings and masses. In particular, we find that the current data prefers two-body decay kinematics involving the emission of a single massive scalar or a vector particle, or alternatively, three-body decays involving pairs of massive scalars or spin 1/2 fermions. When applicable, we compare our findings with existing literature and briefly discuss some model-building implications.

2024-03-20, **Opportunities at the Sanford Underground Research Facility**, Jaret Heise et.al., [2403.13671v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13671v1)

 The Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) has been operating for more than 15 years as an international facility dedicated to advancing compelling multidisciplinary underground scientific research in rare-process physics, as well as offering research opportunities in other disciplines. SURF laboratory facilities include a Surface Campus as well as campuses at the 4850-foot level (1490 m, 4300 m.w.e.) that host a range of significant physics experiments, including the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) dark matter experiment and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment. The CASPAR nuclear astrophysics accelerator completed the first phase of operation and is planning for the second phase beginning in 2024. SURF is also home to the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) that will host the international Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). SURF offers world-class service, including an ultralow background environment, low-background assay capabilities, and electroformed copper is produced at the facility. SURF is preparing to increase underground laboratory space. Plans are advancing for construction of new large caverns (nominally 100m L x 20m W x 24m H) on the 4850L (1485 m, 4100 m.w.e.) on the timeframe of next generation experiments (~2030). SURF plans to leverage existing advisory and community committees as well as engage the underground science community to inform plans for future laboratory space.

2024-03-20, **The electric dipole moment in a model for neutrino mass, dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the Universe**, Kazuki Enomoto et.al., [2403.13613v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13613v1)

 The electric dipole moment is examined in a three-loop neutrino mass model with dark matter originally proposed in Aoki et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 051805 (2009)]. The model contains a $CP$-violating phase in the Higgs potential which plays an important role in electroweak baryogenesis and is thus expected to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe simultaneously. However, such a $CP$-violating phase is severely constrained by the measurements of the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM), and a suppression mechanism for the eEDM is necessary to explain the observed baryon asymmetry while avoiding the constraint. In this paper, we examine neutrino mass, lepton-flavor-violating processes, dark matter, and the eEDM in the model. We show that the eEDM can be suppressed by destructive interference between the $CP$-violating phases in the Higgs sector and the dark sector with large $CP$-violating phases. We propose some benchmark scenarios including $O(1)$ $CP$-violating phases where tiny neutrino mass and dark matter can be explained while avoiding all current experimental and theoretical constraints. These $CP$-violating phases are expected to be large enough to generate the observed baryon asymmetry in the electroweak baryogenesis scenario.

2024-03-20, **Novel imprint of a dark photon from the 3-3-1-1 model**, Doan Minh Luong et.al., [2403.13494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13494v1)

 We investigate a dark photon that arises from the UV model based upon $SU(3)\_C\otimes SU(3)\_L\otimes U(1)\_X \otimes U(1)\_G$ (3-3-1-1) gauge symmetry, where the last three factors enlarge the electroweak symmetry encompassing electric charge $Q=T\_3 - 1/ \sqrt{3}T\_8 +X$ and dark charge $D = -2/\sqrt{3} T\_8 +G$. It is well-established that this model addresses the questions of family number, neutrino mass, and dark matter. It is shown in this work that if the 3-3-1-1 breaking scale is much bigger than the dark charge breaking scale, the relevant dark gauge boson $Z'$ is uniquely imprinted at TeV, avoiding dangerous FCNC processes, obeying precision electroweak measurements, as well as contributing to collider phenomena, even if no kinetic mixing is presented. The dark matter observables are perhaps governed by the dark charge breaking Higgs field instead of the dark photon.

2024-03-20, **Design, construction, and operation of a 1-ton Water-based Liquid scintillator detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory**, X. Xiang et.al., [2403.13231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13231v1)

 Water-based liquid scintillators (WbLS) are attractive neutrino detector materials because they allow us to tune the ratio of the Cherenkov and scintillation signals. Using WbLS large-scale neutrino experiments can benefit from both directional reconstruction and enhanced low-energy efficiency. Furthermore, broadening the science capability of such materials by metal doping may be better suited for water based liquid scintillators. We recently constructed and commissioned a 1-ton WbLS detector with good photosensor coverage and a capable data acquisition system. We intend to use this flexible detector system as a testbed for WbLS R&D. In this paper we give an overview of the 1-ton system and provide some early analysis results.

2024-03-21, **A new class of axion haloscope resonators: the polygonal coaxial cavity**, Raffaele Di Vora et.al., [2403.14503v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14503v1)

 In the search for axionic Dark Matter, the high frequency part of the QCD axion parameter space is favored, as indicated by both cosmological and astrophysical arguments and recent indications from lattice QCD calculations. To extend the probing range of cavity haloscopes, solutions addressing the unfavorable scaling of cavity volume with frequency must be developed. Here, we present a novel type of high-volume thin shell resonator for high frequency haloscope dark matter searches. The cavity is formed by two nested and coaxial right angle polygonal prisms enclosed within two flat endcaps. For the axion-sensitive (pseudo-)TM010 mode, finite element simulations yield form factor of the order of 0.8 and Q factor of the order of 60000 for a copper cavity at 4$\,$K. High tunability of up to $\sim 5\%$ is achieved by reciprocal rotation of the two prisms, without significant changes in haloscope sensitivity. A prototype aluminium hexagonal cavity was built and tested, confirming the main characteristics of the design.

2024-03-21, **Probing Primordial Black Holes and Dark Matter Clumps in the Solar System with Gravimeter and GNSS Networks**, Michal Cuadrat-Grzybowski et.al., [2403.14397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14397v1)

 We show that Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and gravimeters on Earth and in space can potentially offer the most accurate direct measurement of local density of near-Earth asteroid-mass Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Dark Matter (DM) clumps in the solar system by means of gravitational influence. Using semi-analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulation, this paper revisits the analysis of the trajectories of DM clumps in the solar system, including both captured objects and hyperbolic trajectories. A link is thus made between the frequency and distance of Earth overflights for a given mass flux, and a direct measure of dark matter clump density in the solar system. We then model the signature of a close flyby of a DM object on orbital data from GNSS satellites and gravity measurements from gravimeters. We thus obtain a first assessment of the single probe sensitivity. It paves the way for an exhaustive statistical analysis of 28 years of gravimeters and GNSS data to obtain observational constraints on the density of the PBHs and DM clumps within the solar system, for the mass range $[10^8-10^{17}]$ kg. In addition, our methodology offers a possibility of direct detection in cases where DM clumps are endowed with an additional long-range clump-matter fifth-force beyond gravity.

2024-03-21, **Hint of a long-range dark sector fifth force in the current cosmological data?**, Vidhya Ganesan et.al., [2403.14247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14247v1)

 Many previous studies have explored models of dynamically interacting dark energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$\_0$ES. Our results, for the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero $\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit) corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the addition of SH$\_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of $\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of constraints on the dark sector interaction.

2024-03-20, **Conformally Invariant Gravity and Gravitating Mirages**, Victor Berezin et.al., [2403.14031v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14031v1)

 The action of an ideal fluid in Euler variables with a variable number of particles is used for the phenomenological description of the processes of particle creation in strong external fields. It has been demonstrated that the conformal invariance of the creation law imposes quite strict restrictions on the possible types of sources. It is shown that combinations with the particle number density in the creation law can be interpreted as dark matter within the framework of this model.

2024-03-20, **Cosmology with Persistent Homology: a Fisher Forecast**, Jacky H. T. Yip et.al., [2403.13985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13985v1)

 Persistent homology naturally addresses the multi-scale topological characteristics of the large-scale structure as a distribution of clusters, loops, and voids. We apply this tool to the dark matter halo catalogs from the Quijote simulations, and build a summary statistic for comparison with the joint power spectrum and bispectrum statistic regarding their information content on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. Through a Fisher analysis, we find that constraints from persistent homology are tighter for 8 out of the 10 parameters by margins of 13-50%. The complementarity of the two statistics breaks parameter degeneracies, allowing for a further gain in constraining power when combined. We run a series of consistency checks to consolidate our results, and conclude that our findings motivate incorporating persistent homology into inference pipelines for cosmological survey data.

2024-03-20, **Continuous Gravitational Waves: A New Window to Look for Heavy Non-annihilating Dark Matter**, Sulagna Bhattacharya et.al., [2403.13886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13886v1)

 Sun-like stars can transmute into comparable mass black holes by steadily accumulating heavy non-annihilating dark matter particles over the course of their lives. If such stars form in binary systems, they could give rise to quasi-monochromatic, persistent gravitational waves, commonly known as continuous gravitational waves, as they inspiral towards one another. We demonstrate that next-generation space-based detectors, e.g., Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Big Bang Observer (BBO), can provide novel constraints on dark matter parameters (dark matter mass and its interaction cross-section with the nucleons) by probing gravitational waves from transmuted Sun-like stars that are in close binaries. Our projected constraints depend on several astrophysical uncertainties, nevertheless, are competitive with the existing constraints obtained from cosmological measurements as well as terrestrial direct searches, demonstrating a notable science-case for these space-based gravitational wave detectors as probes of particle dark matter.

2024-03-20, **Measuring the Substructure Mass Power Spectrum of 23 SLACS Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lenses with Convolutional Neural Networks**, Joshua Fagin et.al., [2403.13881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13881v1)

 Strong gravitational lensing can be used as a tool for constraining the substructure in the mass distribution of galaxies. In this study we investigate the power spectrum of dark matter perturbations in a population of 23 Hubble Space Telescope images of strong galaxy-galaxy lenses selected from The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey. We model the dark matter substructure as a Gaussian Random Field perturbation on a smooth lens mass potential, characterized by power-law statistics. We expand upon the previously developed machine learning framework to predict the power-law statistics by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accounts for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. For the training sets, we use the smooth lens mass potentials and reconstructed source galaxies that have been previously modelled through traditional fits of analytical and shapelet profiles as a starting point. We train three CNNs with different training set: the first using standard data augmentation on the best-fitting reconstructed sources, the second using different reconstructed sources spaced throughout the posterior distribution, and the third using a combination of the two data sets. We apply the trained CNNs to the SLACS data and find agreement in their predictions. Our results suggest a significant substructure perturbation favoring a high frequency power spectrum across our lens population.

2024-03-20, **Superconducting Microwave Detector Technology for Ultra-Light Dark Matter Haloscopes and other Fundamental Physics Experiments: Device Physics (Part II)**, David J. Goldie et.al., [2403.13555v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13555v1)

 We consider and compare candidate superconducting detector technologies that might be applied to the readout of cavity-axion haloscopes and similar fundamental physics experiments. We conclude that a transition edge sensor (TES) configured with ballistic-phonon thermal isolation operated with a superconducting transition temperature of order 30 mK would provide quantum-limited detection performance at frequencies above 5 GHz. This would permit the realisation of integrated homodyne detectors based on TESs that we believe would make a unique contribution to a variety of fundamental physics experiments, particularly those based on reading out microwave cavities in the quantum ground state.

2024-03-20, **Superconducting Microwave Detector Technology for Ultra-Light Dark Matter Haloscopes and other Fundamental Physics Experiments: Background Theory (Part I)**, Christopher N. Thomas et.al., [2403.13554v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13554v1)

 We consider how superconducting microwave detector technology might be applied to the readout of cavity-axion haloscopes and similar fundamental physics experiments. Expressions for the sensitivity of two detection schemes are derived: 1) a dispersive spectrometer, and 2) a direct-conversion/homodyne receiver using detectors as mixing elements. In both cases the semi-classical/Poisson-mixture approach is used to account for quantum effects. Preliminary sensitivity calculations are performed to guide future development work. These suggest the homodyne scheme offers a near-term solution for realising near-quantum-noise limited receivers with improved usability compared with parametric amplifiers. Similarly, they show that the dispersive spectrometer offers a potential way to beat the quantum noise limit, but that significant technological development work is needed to do so.

2024-03-20, **Scalar Dark Matter and Stability of Higgs Vacuum within a Minimal SO(10) GUT Model**, Nilavjyoti Hazarika et.al., [2403.13529v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13529v1)

 In this work, we delve to investigate a feasible range of dark matter (DM) masses within a non-supersymmetric $SO(10)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scalar dark matter model, in freeze-out scenario. This model includes a singlet scalar denoted as S and an inert doublet represented by $\phi$. Being part of SO(10), the quantum numbers of DM particles are assigned and hence we know their nature. These fields are odd under a discrete $Z\_2$ matter parity $(-1)^{3(B-L)}$. The dark matter with mass 300 $\leq M\_{DM} \leq$ 1000 GeV emerges as a mixture of the $Z\_2$-odd scalar singlet $S$ and the neutral element of the doublet $\phi$, both residing within a \textbf{16}-dim scalar representation of $SO(10)$. In this work we consider a real scalar \textbf{S} belonging to \textbf{16} of SO(10) as DM. We also investigate the one-loop vacuum stability through the solution of Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) for the model's parameters. Subsequently, we scrutinize the model's predictions within the confines of contemporary theoretical and experimental restrictions. In addition to achieving vacuum stability in the SO(10) framework, the DM mass is found to lie in the previously unaddressed (theoretically) intermediate mass region of 300$\leqslant$ MDM $\leqslant$ 1000 GeV which also adheres to many current phenomenological constraints, like recent direct experimental bounds from XENON1T, indirect detection bounds from Fermi-LAT experiment, Higgs invisible decay and Electroweak Precision Test. The stability of the electroweak vacuum is seen to be present up to the Planck scale. These model predictions possess the potential for future validation through dark matter search experiments, as they are testable in future DM search experiments, along with the added feature that the model is a part of an elegant grand unified theory.

2024-03-20, **Improved modelling for dark photon detection with dish antennas**, Jordan Gué et.al., [2403.13448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13448v1)

 A vector dark matter candidate, also known as dark photon, would induce an oscillating electric field through kinetic mixing. One detection strategy uses a spherical reflector to focus the induced emission at its center of curvature. On one hand, we investigate the effects of diffraction in this type of experiment from an analytical standpoint, making use of the Kirchhoff integral theorem in the low-curvature dish limit. On the other hand, we estimate the impact of mode-matching, in the case of detection by a pyramidal horn antenna. We show that the expected signal intensity can be significantly reduced compared to usual estimates. Our method is applied to the re-interpretation of the SHUKET experiment data, the results of which are shown to be degraded by a factor of $\sim$~50 due to both diffraction and mode-matching. The analytical method allows optimizing some experimental parameters to gain sensitivity in future runs. Our results can be applied to any dish antenna experiment using a low curvature reflector.

2024-03-20, **Search for Dark Matter Axions with Tunable TM_020 mode**, Sungjae Bae et.al., [2403.13390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13390v1)

 Axions are hypothesized particles believed to potentially resolve two major puzzles in modern physics: the strong CP problem and the nature of dark matter. Cavity-based axion haloscopes represent the most sensitive tools for probing their theoretically favored couplings to photons in the microelectronvolt range. However, as the search mass (or frequency) increases, the detection efficiency decreases, largely due to a decrease in cavity volume. Despite the potential of higher-order resonant modes to preserve experimental volume, their practical application in searches has been limited by the challenge of maintaining a high form factor over a reasonably wide search bandwidth. We introduce an innovative tuning method that uses the unique properties of auxetic materials, designed to effectively tune higher modes. This approach was applied to the TM\_020 mode for a dark matter axion search exploring a mass range from 21.38 to 21.79 ueV, resulting in the establishment of new exclusion limits for axion-photon coupling greater than approximately 10^-13 GeV^-1. These findings signify a breakthrough, demonstrating that our tuning mechanism facilitates the practical utilization of higher-order modes for cavity haloscope searches.

2024-03-21, **Hubble Space Telescope images of SN 1987A: Evolution of the ejecta and the equatorial ring from 2009 to 2022**, Sophie Rosu et.al., [2403.14361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14361v1)

 Supernova (SN) 1987A offers a unique opportunity to study how a spatially resolved SN evolves into a young supernova remnant (SNR). We present and analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations of SN 1987A obtained in 2022 and compare them with HST observations from 2009 to 2021. These observations allow us to follow the evolution of the equatorial ring (ER), the rapidly expanding ejecta, and emission from the center over a wide range in wavelength from 2000 to 11 000 AA. The ER has continued to fade since it reached its maximum ~8200 days after the explosion. In contrast, the ejecta brightened until day ~11000 before their emission levelled off; the west side brightened more than the east side, which we attribute to the stronger X-ray emission by the ER on that side. The asymmetric ejecta expand homologously in all filters, which are dominated by various emission lines from hydrogen, calcium, and iron. From this overall similarity, we infer the ejecta are chemically well-mixed on large scales. The exception is the diffuse morphology observed in the UV filters dominated by emission from the Mg II resonance lines that get scattered before escaping. The 2022 observations do not show any sign of the compact object that was inferred from highly-ionized emission near the remnant's center observed with JWST. We determine an upper limit on the flux from a compact central source in the [O III] HST image. The non-detection of this line indicates that the S and Ar lines observed with JWST originate from the O free inner Si - S - Ar rich zone and/or that the observed [O III] flux is strongly affected by dust scattering.

2024-03-21, **The disappearance of the blue and luminous progenitor of the Type IIn SN 2010jl**, Zexi Niu et.al., [2403.14106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14106v1)

 Type IIn supernovae (SNe) exhibit narrow hydrogen lines that arise from the strong interaction between ejecta and circumstellar material. It remains poorly understood, however, what progenitor stars give rise to these explosions. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the progenitor and environment of the nearby Type IIn SN 2010jl. With newer images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, we confirm that the previously reported progenitor candidate is a blend of the progenitor itself and a field star cluster in its close vicinity. SN 2010jl has now become much fainter than the progenitor. The progenitor is very blue and luminous with an effective temperature of log $T\_{\rm eff}/{\rm K}$=4.26$^{+0.11}\_{-0.09}$ and a luminosity of log $L/L\_{\odot}$ =6.52$^{+0.20}\_{-0.16}$. It is located in a very young star-forming region, but its luminosity is much higher than that expected from the environmental stellar populations. We suggest that the progenitor was in outburst when observed. Its nature and evolutionary history remain to be investigated.

2024-03-20, **PINNferring the Hubble Function with Uncertainties**, Lennart Röver et.al., [2403.13899v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13899v1)

 The Hubble function characterizes a given Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime and can be related to the densities of the cosmological fluids and their equations of state. We show how physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) emulate this dynamical system and provide fast predictions of the luminosity distance for a given choice of densities and equations of state, as needed for the analysis of supernova data. We use this emulator to perform a model-independent and parameter-free reconstruction of the Hubble function on the basis of supernova data. As part of this study, we develop and validate an uncertainty treatment for PINNs using a heteroscedastic loss and repulsive ensembles.

2024-03-20, **The Distance to the S147 Supernova Remnant**, C. S. Kochanek et.al., [2403.13892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13892v1)

 In the absence of a parallax distance to a pulsar or a surviving binary in a supernova remnant (SNR), distances to Galactic SNRs are generally very uncertain. However, by combining Gaia data with wide field, multi-fiber echelle spectroscopy, it is now possible to obtain accurate distances to many SNRs with limited extinction by searching for the appearance of high velocity CaII or NaI absorption lines in hot stars as a function of distance. We demonstrate this for the SNR S147 using the spectra of 259 luminous, blue stars. We obtain a median distance of 1.37 kpc (1.30 to 1.47 kpc at 90% confidence) that is consistent with the median parallax distance to the pulsar of 1.46 kpc (1.12 to 2.10 kpc at 90% confidence), but with significantly smaller uncertainties. Our distance is also consistent with the distance to the candidate unbound binary companion in this SNR, HD37424. The presence of high velocity absorption lines is correlated with the emission line flux of the SNR but not with the radio flux.

2024-03-20, **The DEHVILS in the Details: Type Ia Supernova Hubble Residual Comparisons and Mass Step Analysis in the Near-Infrared**, Erik R. Peterson et.al., [2403.13885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13885v1)

 Measurements of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) have been used both as an alternate path to cosmology compared to optical measurements and as a method of constraining key systematics for the larger optical studies. With the DEHVILS sample, the largest published NIR sample with consistent NIR coverage of maximum light across three NIR bands ($Y$, $J$, and $H$), we check three key systematics: (i) the reduction in Hubble residual scatter as compared to the optical, (ii) the measurement of a "mass step" or lack thereof and its implications, and (iii) the ability to distinguish between various dust models by analyzing correlations between Hubble residuals in the NIR and optical. We produce accurate simulations of the DEHVILS sample and find, contrary to assumptions in the literature, it is $\textit{harder}$ to differentiate between various dust models than previously understood. Additionally, we find that fitting with the current SALT3 model does not yield accurate wavelength-dependent stretch-luminosity correlations, and we propose a limited solution for this problem. From the data, we see that (i) the standard deviation of Hubble residual values from NIR bands treated as standard candles are 0.007-0.042 mag smaller than those in the optical, (ii) the NIR mass step is not constrainable with the current sample size from DEHVILS, and (iii) Hubble residuals in the NIR and optical are correlated in both the simulations and the data. We test a few variations on the number and combinations of filters and data samples, and we observe that none of our findings or conclusions are significantly impacted by these modifications.

2024-03-20, **Examining a hadronic $γ$-ray scenario for the radiative shell & molecular clouds of the old GeV supernova remnant G298.6$-$0.0**, Paul K. H. Yeung et.al., [2403.13723v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13723v1)

 Based on the 13.7~yr Fermi-LAT data, Yeung et al. (2023) claimed detection of two $\gamma$-ray sources (Src-NE and Src-NW) associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) G298.6$-$0.0, and interpreted it as an old GeV SNR interacting with molecular clouds (MCs). In this follow-up study, we refine the flux measurements below 2~GeV with Fermi-LAT event types of better angular reconstruction. Then, we report our cosmic-ray phenomenology in a hadronic scenario, considering both the shell and MC regions of SNR G298.6$-$0.0. We confirm that both the $\gamma$-ray spectra of Src-NE and Src-NW exhibit spectral breaks at $1.50\_{-0.50}^{+0.60}$~GeV and $0.68\_{-0.11}^{+0.32}$~GeV, respectively. Src-NW has a harder broadband photon index than Src-NE, suggesting an appreciable difference between the physical separations of their respective emission sites from SNR G298.6$-$0.0. The cosmic-ray spectrum responsible for Src-NE starts with a minimum energy $E\_\mathrm{CR,min}=1.38\_{-0.16}^{+0.47}$~GeV, and has a proton index $\Gamma\_\mathrm{CR}=2.57\_{-0.21}^{+0.18}$ below the exponential cutoff energy $E\_\mathrm{CR,max}=240\_{-150}^{+240}$~GeV. Accordingly, we argue that Src-NE is dominated by the SNR shell, while only a minor portion of lower-energy emission is contributed by the MCs interacting with the SNR. The cosmic-ray population for Src-NW starts at a higher energy such that the $E\_\mathrm{CR,min}$ ratio of Src-NW to Src-NE is $\gtrsim$2. The high $E\_\mathrm{CR,min}$, as well as the high cosmic-ray energy density required ($\sim$26~eV~cm$^{-3}$), supports the interpretation that Src-NW is predominantly the $\gamma$-ray emission from the farther MCs being bombarded by protons that had earlier escaped from SNR G298.6$-$0.0. By comparing the high-energy features of G298.6$-$0.0 with those of analogical SNRs, especially SNR W28 and SNR W44, we further constrain the age of SNR G298.6$-$0.0 to be 10--30~kyr.

 We demonstrate in a proof-of-concept numerical hydrodynamics calculation that the narrow radial filamentary structures seen in Pa 30 could be generated through highly efficient cooling (e.g. via line emission) in the ejecta. Efficient cooling in the ejecta causes a drop of pressure support in Rayleigh-Taylor fingers, leading them to be compressed, and suppressing the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Following this result, we make three predictions that could determine whether this is the mechanism responsible for shaping Pa 30: First, we predict very strong emission lines, strong enough to cool a significant fraction of the shock energy in an expansion time. Secondly, we predict that the forward shock should be highly corrugated on small scales, with the shock front closely following the structure of the filaments. Third, we predict that these filaments should be nearly ballistic, with velocities around 90% of the free-expansion velocity ($v \approx 0.9 ~r/t$). These predictions should be falsifiable in follow-up observations of this remnant.

2024-03-20, **Shock and Cosmic Ray Chemistry Associated with the Supernova Remnant W28**, Tian-Yu Tu et.al., [2403.13305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13305v1)

 Supernova remnants (SNRs) exert strong influence on the physics and chemistry of the nearby molecular clouds (MCs) through shock waves and the cosmic rays (CRs) they accelerate. To investigate the SNR-cloud interaction in the prototype interacting SNR W28 (G6.4$-$0.1), we present new observations of $\rm HCO^+$, HCN and HNC $J=1\text{--}0$ lines, supplemented by archival data of CO isotopes, $\rm N\_2H^+$ and $\rm H^{13}CO^+$. We compare the spatial distribution and spectral line profiles of different molecular species. Using local thermodynatic equilibrium (LTE) assumption, we obtain an abundance ratio $N({\rm HCO^+})/N({\rm CO})\sim10^{-4}$ in the northeastern shocked cloud, which is higher by an order of magnitude than the values in unshocked clouds. This can be accounted for by the chemistry jointly induced by shock and CRs, with the physical parameters previously obtained from observations: preshock density $n\_{\rm H}\sim 2\times 10^{5}\rm \ cm^{-3}$, CR ionization rate $\zeta=2.5\times 10^{-15} \rm \ s^{-1}$ and shock velocity $V\_{\rm s}=15\text{--}20\rm \ km\ s^{-1}$. Towards a point outside the northeastern boundary of W28 with known high CR ionization rate, we estimate the abundance ratio $ N({\rm HCO^+})/N({\rm N\_2H^+}) \approx 0.6\text{--}3.3$, which can be reproduced by a chemical simulation if a high density $n\_{\rm H}\sim 2\times 10^5 \ \rm cm^{-3}$ is adopted.
