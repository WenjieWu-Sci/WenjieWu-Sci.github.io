2025-11-17, **Probing scalar-neutrino and scalar-dark-matter interactions with PandaX-4T**, PandaX Collaboration et.al., [2511.13515v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13515v1)

 Scalar-mediated interactions may exist among neutrinos, dark matter particles, or between the two. Double $β$-decay experiments provide a powerful tool to probe such exotic interactions. Using $^{136}$Xe double $β$-decay data from PandaX-4T, we perform the first direct spectral search in the energy range of 20 to 2800~keV, setting the most stringent limits to date on scalar-mediated neutrino self-interactions for mediator masses below 2~MeV$/c^2$. These results place significant constraints on models invoking such interactions to alleviate the Hubble Tension. Assuming the same scalar also mediates dark matter self-interactions, constraints on the dark matter-scalar interactions can be placed in conjunction with cosmological constraints.

2025-11-17, **Measurement of Exclusive $π^+$--argon Interactions Using ProtoDUNE-SP**, DUNE Collaboration et.al., [2511.13462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13462v1)

 We present the measurement of $π^{+}$--argon inelastic cross sections using the ProtoDUNE Single-Phase liquid argon time projection chamber in the incident $π^+$ kinetic energy range of 500 -- 800 MeV in multiple exclusive channels (absorption, charge exchange, and the remaining inelastic interactions). The results of this analysis are important inputs to simulations of liquid argon neutrino experiments such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment and the Short Baseline Neutrino program at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. They will be employed to improve the modeling of final state interactions within neutrino event generators used by these experiments, as well as the modeling of $π^{+}$--argon secondary interactions within the liquid argon. This is the first measurement of $π^+$--argon absorption at this kinetic energy range as well as the first ever measurement of $π^{+}$--argon charge exchange.

2025-11-17, **Prospects for detecting periodic or sharp fast-time features in the supernova neutrino lightcurve with IceCube**, Jakob Beise et.al., [2511.13148v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13148v1)

 Neutrinos produced in core-collapse supernova offer a direct probe into the hydrodynamics and energy transport mechanisms during the collapse and play a pivotal role in the shock revival and success of the supernova explosion. Fast-time features of the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum encode information about phenomena such as turbulence, convection, shock revival and potential quark-hadron phase transitions. In this study, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes with a focus on IceCube and the planned extension IceCube-Gen2. Furthermore, we consider the effect on the detection sensitivity from wavelength shifters through enhanced light collection.   A variety of models predict periodic fast-time features in supernova light curves; to quantify their detectability without relying on specific models, we investigate the detector response to a generic parameterisation of such features. We find that independent of feature frequency, IceCube-Gen2 instrumented with wavelength shifters has sensitivity to weaker modulations ($>25\%$ amplitude) as compared to only the strongest modulations ($>50\%$ amplitude) with IceCube. In addition, we examine the sensitivity of the neutrino lightcurve to sharp features from a quark-hadron phase transition. Phase transitions leading to a quark star remnant are detectable with IceCube at $5σ$ up to the edge of the Galaxy, and throughout the Small Magellanic Cloud with IceCube-Gen2 equipped with wavelength-shifters. In contrast, models collapsing into a black hole are observable only within the Galaxy, covering $41\%$ of the CCSNe population for IceCube and nearly all ($91\%$) for IceCube-Gen2 complemented by wavelength shifters. These results highlight the potential of IceCube-Gen2 for detecting Galactic sources more reliably and with greater reach.

2025-11-17, **NuBench: An Open Benchmark for Deep Learning-Based Event Reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes**, Rasmus F. Orsoe et.al., [2511.13111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13111v1)

 Neutrino telescopes are large-scale detectors designed to observe Cherenkov radiation produced from neutrino interactions in water or ice. They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods.   We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation.

2025-11-16, **Finding Trafficked Radiological Materials via Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering**, Brianna N Ryan et.al., [2511.12818v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12818v1)

 The potential to use neutrinos for nuclear non-proliferation has been heavily debated due to the tension between production abundance and low interaction rate. A newly detected neutrino interaction channel, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$ν$NS), could potentially end this debate due to its improved cross-section compared to other neutrino interactions. This paper presents a feasibility study for the use of CE$ν$NS superconducting detectors to find trafficked radiological materials. To do this, we calculated the minimal activity required for situational detection under ideal conditions, without background, at 95% confidence level. This analysis was performed for four commonly smuggled radioisotopes: $^{137}$Cs, $^{109}$Cd, $^{192}$Ir, and $^{57}$Co. Using these results, we conclude that CE$ν$NS could be used to discover trafficked $^{137}$Cs sources with an activity above the PBq level, but that it is not applicable for finding other radioactive sources. This framework can also be applied to other nuclear security concerns, such as safeguarding generation IV nuclear reactors.

2025-11-17, **Charge carrier generation in RNDR-DEPFET Detectors**, Niels Wernicke et.al., [2511.13367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13367v1)

 Depleted p-channel field effect transistor detectors with repetitive-non-destructive readout (RNDR-DEPFETs) achieve a deep sub-electron noise by averaging several independent measurements of one single event. During the repetitive readout collected electrons are transferred between two readout nodes within each pixel to enable electron number-resolved measurements. The pixels serve as a unit cell of an active pixel sensor to achieve a high level of parallelization and fast readout. These properties are exploited in the DANAE experiment, which aims for the direct detection of light dark matter based with the event signature of electron recoils. We present the experimental characterization of an $64\times64$ RNDR-DEPFET pixel detector with a focus on the charge carrier generation rate. This technology achieves a high time resolution, which increases its sensitivity on rare events with a signal of two or more electrons due to the Poisson distribution of thermal generated electrons.

2025-11-17, **Probing the Nature of Dark Matter Self-Interactions Through Observations of Massive Black Hole Mergers**, Zachary J. Hoelscher et.al., [2511.13220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13220v1)

 Though the nature of dark matter remains elusive, two models have come to prominence with testable predictions: cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). While CDM remains the widely accepted model, SIDM was introduced to potentially help resolve the discrepancies between the predictions of the CDM model and observational data, in particular the predicted central density profiles. Previous work involving simulations of small numbers of Milky Way-mass galaxies shows that SIDM delays massive black hole mergers as compared to CDM when the host halo has a flattened central density profile. It is, however, unclear how well massive black hole observations are able to differentiate between CDM and SIDM. In this work, we use mock gravitational wave observations of massive black hole mergers from LISA, a space-based gravitational wave observatory set to launch in the 2030s, to test LISA's capability to indirectly probe dark matter physics. As a proof of concept, we show that LISA may be able to distinguish between CDM and SIDM with a short-range interaction and a constant cross section of 1 $\rm{cm^2~ g^{-1}}$ at the $\sim2σ$ level or greater, provided at least $\sim80$ massive black hole mergers are observed with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10. Our exploratory work shows that LISA may provide a pathway to probe dark matter self-interactions, motivating future work with more realistic, currently-favored models and larger simulation suites.

2025-11-17, **Numerical investigation of electrostatically confined excitons in monolayer $\text{MoSe}_2$**, Lefan Dolg et.al., [2511.13177v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13177v1)

 We investigate exciton confinement to a quantum wire in monolayer $\text{MoSe}\_2$ where the confinement is achieved by a p-i-n junction. We employ an effective-mass exciton model and solve the problem numerically, reflecting device geometries found in experimental state-of-the-art set up. Our method allows us to investigate the entire spectrum of confined states. We show the emergence of quantum confinement and study the dependence of the confined states as a function of electrical gate voltages, which are experimentally tunable parameters. We find that the confined states can be divided into bright and dark states with the dark states having small but finite oscillator strengths. Their oscillator strengths are low enough that they have not yet been detected in experiments, whereas the spectrum of the bright exciton states reproduces recent experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into the theoretical background of confined exciton states beyond the ground state and pave the way for the development of new confinement schemes as well as avenues to access the previously not detected dark states.

2025-11-17, **Observational properties of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter halo**, Zhi Li et.al., [2511.13156v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13156v1)

 This study investigates the accretion process and observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo. We examine the influence of the density ρ\_{s} and radius r\_{s} of the DM halo on key disk properties, including the energy flux, temperature distribution, and emission spectrum. Our results show that all three of these quantities decrease with increasing ρ\_{s} or r\_{s}. Furthermore, by generating and analyzing both direct and secondary images of the accretion disk, we explore how the observational inclination angle and the DM halo parameters ρ\_{s} and rs affect image profiles. Finally, the observed flux distributions are presented for different inclination angles. Our findings indicate that the accretion disk becomes colder and dimmer as the DM halo parameters increase, highlighting the significant role of DM in shaping BH observables.

2025-11-17, **Topological Signatures of Heating and Dark Matter in the 21 cm Forest**, Hayato Shimabukuro et.al., [2511.13092v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13092v1)

 We show that the topology of the 21 cm forest carries cosmological information that is inaccessible to traditional amplitude- or correlation-based statistics. Applying topological data analysis to simulated spectra spanning a range of X-ray heating efficiencies and dark-matter free-streaming scales, we compute persistence diagrams and Betti-0 curves that describe the formation and merger hierarchy of absorption troughs. A small set of interpretable descriptors (trough-line density, lifetime variance, and lifetime skewness) respond in nearly orthogonal directions across the (f\_X, m\_WDM) parameter space, enabling a substantial reduction of the degeneracy between heating and dark-matter suppression. These topological signatures remain detectable under SKA1-Low-like thermal noise, demonstrating that topology provides a stable and non-Gaussian probe of small-scale physics during Cosmic Dawn.

2025-11-17, **Quasinormal ringing of a regular black hole sourced by the Dehnen-type distribution of matter**, S. V. Bolokhov et.al., [2511.12859v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12859v1)

 We study quasinormal modes of test scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac fields in the background of a new analytic regular black-hole solution obtained as an exact solution of the Einstein equations sourced by a Dehnen-type matter distribution in [R. A. Konoplya, A. Zhidenko, arXiv:2511.03066]. The metric is asymptotically flat and characterized by a simple lapse function $f(r)=1-2 M r^{2}/(r+a)^{3}$, where $M$ is the ADM mass and $a$ represents the characteristic scale of the surrounding dark-matter halo that regularizes the central region. The effective potentials for all perturbing fields possess the standard single-barrier form, ensuring linear stability and the applicability of the WKB formalism. The quasinormal frequencies are computed using the sixth- and ninth-order WKB methods with Padé corrections and verified by time-domain integration, both approaches showing excellent agreement. The parameter $a$ leads to a moderate increase in the real oscillation frequency, while the damping rate remains almost unchanged, producing only small corrections to the Schwarzschild spectrum. Since such deviations become appreciable only for unrealistically dense halos, our results confirm that the quasinormal spectrum of astrophysical black holes is safely unaffected by ordinary galactic dark-matter environments.

2025-11-16, **Black hole spacetimes with dark matter spikes: Energy-momentum tensor and backreaction effects**, Wei Xiong et.al., [2511.12570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12570v1)

 We study the energy-momentum tensor of a dark matter (DM) spike formed during the adiabatic growth of a black hole embedded in a DM halo, and investigate its backreaction on the spacetime geometry. Within the Einstein cluster framework, we derive the complete tensor, explicitly incorporating the kinetic contribution to the energy density and the anisotropic pressure arising from noncircular particle orbits. Adopting the Hernquist profile as an illustrative model of DM halo and employing parameters appropriate to the Milky Way, we find that near the spike, the kinetic term enhances the total energy density by approximately $50\%$ relative to the rest-mass component, while the nonzero radial pressure induces a mild anisotropy in the stress tensor. The derived tensor satisfies all standard energy conditions. By treating it as a fixed source in Einstein' s equations, we numerically obtain a static, spherically symmetric metric that deviates from the Schwarzschild solution by an amount more than twice that found when only the mass density is considered. These results demonstrate that including the full dynamical structure of the DM spike is essential for accurately modeling the backreaction of DM on black hole spacetimes.

2025-11-17, **Cosmic Expansion Driven by Gravitational Particle Production: Toward a Complete Cosmological Scenario**, P. W. R. Lima et.al., [2511.13392v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13392v1)

 A dark-energy-free cosmological model ($Ω\_{DE} \equiv 0$) based on gravitationally induced adiabatic particle creation is proposed. The thermodynamics of particle production yields an effective negative pressure that drives both primordial inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration. The model, characterized by four components and two free parameters ($α$, $β$), reproduces a $Λ$CDM-like expansion for suitable $α$, while $β$ introduces small but testable deviations from the cosmic concordance model. Constraints from type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+SH0ES) and H(z) data indicate $β\simeq 0.13$, suggesting a mild departure from standard cosmology and possible relief of the $H\_0$ and $S\_8$ tensions. The resulting classical cosmology evolves smoothly between two extreme de Sitter phases, offering a singularity-free, unified scenario that beyond solving old cosmological puzzles opens a new perspective to handle the tensions plaguing the current cosmic concordance model.

2025-11-17, **Constraining r-process nucleosynthesis with multi-objective Galactic chemical evolution models**, M. Molero et.al., [2511.13372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13372v1)

 The astrophysical site(s) of the r-process are uncertain, with candidates such as neutron star mergers and magneto-rotational supernovae predicting different event rates, delay times, and heavy-element yields. Galactic chemical evolution models constrain these properties by comparing model predictions with observed abundances. We explore, in a systematic and data-driven way, the astrophysical conditions under which r-process enrichment can reproduce the observed trends of multiple neutron-capture elements in the Milky Way. Rather than assuming a fixed site, we adopt a flexible, parametric approach to test whether a common set of r-process parameters can explain the chemical evolution of several heavy elements. We compute a grid of one-infall, homogeneous models varying: Eu yield per event, r-process event rate, enrichment delay time, and progenitor mass range. For each of the $\sim 1.5 \times 10^5$ models, we predict [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends by scaling Eu yields with the solar r-process pattern. A multi-objective optimisation based on Pareto fronts identifies models that best reproduce the abundance trends. Best-fitting models favour short delay times ($\leq 30\ \rm Myr$), low-mass progenitors ($\sim 20-25\ \rm M\_\odot$), and an effective Eu injection of $\sim 2 \times 10^{-7}\ \rm M\_\odot$ per event. Stars more massive than $\sim 80\ \rm M\_\odot$ are too rare to dominate the enrichment. While heavy elements can be reproduced, lighter ones show stronger conflicts with Eu, reflecting that the solar r-process scaling relation becomes less valid toward lighter elements. No single class of r-process events, under solar-scaled yields, can explain light and heavy neutron-capture elements; at least two components are required: a main r-process consistent with solar and r-rich stars, and a weaker component producing enhanced light r-process elements, similar to that observed in r-poor stars.

2025-11-17, **Unveiling the nature of the Einstein Probe transient EP 241021a**, J. Quirola-Vásquez et.al., [2511.13314v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13314v1)

 We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the fast X-ray transient EP 241021a, discovered by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope aboard the \emph{Einstein Probe} satellite on 2024 October 21. The event was not detected in gamma-rays. Follow-up observations from $\sim$1.5 to 100 days post-trigger were obtained across X-ray, UV, optical, near-infrared, and radio bands with ground- and space-based facilities. The redshift is constrained to $z = 0.7485$ from prominent optical spectral features. The optical light curve shows complex evolution: an initial $\sim t^{-0.7}$ decay, followed by a rapid re-brightening peaking at day 7.7 with $\sim t^{-1.7}$ decay, and a third phase peaking near day 19 with $\sim t^{-1.3}$ decay. The spectral energy distribution (SED) and its temporal evolution are consistent with a mix of non-thermal and thermal components. Early optical-to-X-ray spectral indices agree with optically thin synchrotron emission, while steepening of the optical SED after $\sim$20 days indicates either a shift in emission mechanism or the emergence of an additional component. Although broad-lined absorption features are absent, comparisons with type Ic-BL supernovae suggest a SN contribution at late times, suggesting a collapsar origin for EP 241021a. The likely SN in EP 241021a appears to require an additional energy source beyond $^{56}$Ni decay. These results support the view that some fast X-ray transients detected by the \emph{Einstein Probe} arise from massive stellar explosions.

2025-11-17, **TransFit-CSM: A Fast, Physically Consistent Framework for Interaction-Powered Transients**, Yu-Hao Zhang et.al., [2511.13265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13265v1)

 We present TransFit-CSM, a fast and physically consistent framework for modeling interaction-powered transients. The method self-consistently couples the ejecta circumstellar medium (CSM) shock dynamics to radiative diffusion from a moving heating boundary tied to the shocks, so that both the photon escape path and the effective diffusion time evolve with radius and time. We solve the mass and momentum equations for the forward and reverse shocks together with the diffusion equation in the unshocked CSM. TransFit-CSM reproduces the canonical sequence of an early dark phase, a diffusion-mediated rise and peak, and a post-interaction cooling tail, and it clarifies why Arnett-like peak scalings break down in optically thick CSM. The framework is well suited for Bayesian inference and constrains physical parameters of the ejecta and CSM from bolometric or joint multi-band light curves. Applications to SN 2006gy and SN 2010jl yield accurate fits and physically interpretable posteriors, highlighting the dominant role of pre-supernova mass loss in shaping the observables. Because it is both computationally efficient and physically grounded, TransFit-CSM bridges simple analytic prescriptions and radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, enabling population-level inference for current and future time-domain surveys.

2025-11-17, **SN 2016iog: A fast declining Type II-L supernova with an ultra-faint tail, persistently interacting with circumstellar material**, Z. -H. Peng et.al., [2511.12929v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12929v1)

 We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rapidly declining Type IIL supernova (SN) 2016iog. SN 2016iog reached its peak $\sim$ 14 days after explosion, with an absolute magnitude in the $V$ band of $-18.64 \pm 0.15$ mag, followed by a steep decline of $8.85 \pm 0.15$~mag~(100\,d)$^{-1}$ post-peak. Such a high decline rate makes SN~2016iog one of the fastest declining Type~IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$α$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$α$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN~2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN~2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material.

2025-11-17, **Near-infrared [P II] and [Fe II] line mapping of Galactic supernova remnants**, Takuma Kokusho et.al., [2511.12891v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12891v1)

 Phosphorus (P) is one of the key ingredients for life, yet its origins in galaxies remain poorly understood. In order to investigate the production of P by supernovae, we performed near-infrared (IR) [P II] and [Fe II] line mapping of 26 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) with the Infrared Survey Facility and Kanata telescopes, using the narrow-band filters tuned to these lines. By combining our data with archival [Fe II] maps from UKIRT, we detected both the [P II] and [Fe II] emissions in five SNRs, only the [Fe II] emission in 15 SNRs, and no line emissions in the remaining six. Using the observed [P II]/[Fe II] ratios and upper limits for non-detections, we derived the P/Fe abundance ratios, which vary by up to two orders of magnitude among our sample SNRs. This suggests that the production rate of P and/or the degree of dust destruction may differ from remnant to remnant, the latter being due to the fact that P is volatile while Fe is mostly locked in dust grains. We used the mid- and far-IR maps to examine the dust content for the five SNRs where both the line emissions are detected. As a result, we find that high P/Fe abundance ratios in the northern and southeastern regions of Cassiopeia A and the Crab Nebula, respectively, are not likely due to dust destruction but may reflect an asymmetric ejection of P during supernova explosions. In the Crab Nebula, it is also possible that near-IR [Ni II] emission contaminates the observed flux in the southeastern region, suggesting that the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, rather than the P/Fe abundance ratio, is relatively high in this part of the remnant.
