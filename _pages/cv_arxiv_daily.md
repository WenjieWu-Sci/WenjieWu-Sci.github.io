2025-07-30, **Characterization of mini-CryoCube detectors from the Ricochet experiment commissioning at the Institut Laue-Langevin**, Antoine Armatol et.al., [2507.22751v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22751v1)

 The Ricochet experiment aims to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process from antineutrinos emitted by a research nuclear reactor operated by the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France). This article presents a description of the Ricochet experimental installation and the detector performance achieved during its commissioning with a mini-CryoCube module consisting of three 42-gram germanium cryogenic calorimeters. The baseline resolutions and background levels are reported both during reactor-on and reactor-off periods, and as noise mitigation techniques were improved. A baseline resolution of 40 eV electron equivalent was achieved for the ionization channel after setup improvements, and the phonon channel resolutions ranged from 50 to 80 eV of total phonon energy. In the energy region from 2 to 7 keV, a nuclear recoil rate of 15(2) events/(kg day keV) is measured during the reactor-off period selecting events in coincidence with muon veto signals. This rate is in agreement with the cosmogenic neutron rate calculated from GEANT4 simulations. After the rejection of events in coincidence with signals in the muon veto detectors, a combined 90% C.L. limit on the nuclear recoil background of < 9 events/(kg day keV) is obtained in that energy region during the reactor-on period, which is compatible with our GEANT4 model calculation corresponding to a total rate of 5 events/(kg day keV). The sensitivity of this analysis was however found to be limited by a surface event contamination which is currently being addressed by the Ricochet Collaboration with upgraded detectors.

2025-07-30, **RENE experiment for the sterile neutrino search using reactor neutrinos**, Byeongsu Yang et.al., [2507.22376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22376v1)

 This paper summarizes the details of the Reactor Experiment for Neutrinos and Exotics (RENE) experiment. It covers the detector construction, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation study, and physics expectations. The primary goal of the RENE project is to investigate the sterile neutrino oscillation at $\Delta{m}^{2}\_{41}\sim 2\,{\rm{eV}^{2}}$. which overlap with the allowed region predicted by the Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly (RAA). On the other hand, the STEREO and PROSPECT experiments have excluded certain regions of the parameter space with 95 \% confidence level (C.L.), while the joint study conducted by RENO and NEOS suggests possible indications of sterile neutrinos at $\Delta{m}^{2}\_{41}\sim2.4\,{\rm{eV}^{2}}$ and $\sim{1.7}{\,\rm{eV}^{2}}$ with sin$^{2}\theta\_{41} < 0.01$. Accordingly, a more meticulous investigation of these remaining regions continues to be a scientifically valuable endeavor. This paper reports the technical details of the detector and physics objectives.

2025-07-29, **Improved measurements of the TeV--PeV extragalactic neutrino spectrum from joint analyses of IceCube tracks and cascades**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2507.22234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22234v1)

 The IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory has discovered the presence of a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux at energies of TeV and beyond using neutrino induced muon tracks and cascade events from neutrino interactions. We present two analyses sensitive to neutrino events in the energy range \SI{1}{TeV} to \SI{10}{PeV}, using more than 10 years of IceCube data. Both analyses consistently reject a neutrino spectrum following a single power-law with significance $>4\,\sigma$ in favor of a broken power law. We describe the methods implemented in the two analyses, the spectral constraints obtained, and the validation of the robustness of the results. Additionally, we report the detection of a muon neutrino in the MESE sample with an energy of $11.4^{+2.46}\_{-2.53} $\,\si{PeV}, the highest energy neutrino observed by IceCube to date. The results presented here show insights into the spectral shape of astrophysical neutrinos, which has important implications for inferring their production processes in a multi-messenger picture.

2025-07-29, **Evidence for a Spectral Break or Curvature in the Spectrum of Astrophysical Neutrinos from 5\,TeV--10\,PeV**, R. Abbasi et.al., [2507.22233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22233v1)

 We report improved measurements of the all flavor astrophysical neutrino spectrum with IceCube by combining complementary neutrino samples in two independent analyses. Both analyses show evidence of a harder spectrum at energies below $\sim$30~TeV compared to higher energies where the spectrum is well characterized by a power law. The spectrum is better described by a log parabola or a broken power law, the latter being the preferred model. Both, however, reject a single power law over an energy range 5~TeV-10~PeV with a significance $>4\sigma$, providing new constraints on properties of cosmic neutrino sources.

2025-07-29, **Development of a RPC system with detailed performance simulation**, Tanay Dey et.al., [2507.22225v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22225v1)

 Neutrinos, elusive and abundant, interact weakly with matter, making detection challenging. This thesis explores neutrino physics, focusing on mass hierarchy and oscillations, with emphasis on India's upcoming INO facility. The Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector, using Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) within magnetized iron plates, aims to resolve neutrino mass hierarchy and precisely measure $\theta\_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2\_{32}$, potentially revealing new physics. The study advances RPC development through simulation techniques. A straight-line model calculates space charge effects during avalanche or streamer processes, improving electric field estimation speed and accuracy. Polarization effects in dielectric electrodes are analyzed, elucidating electric field dependence on electrode parameters. A new class, pAvalancheMC, integrated into Garfield++ software, combines straight-line and image charge models to simulate space charge effects. Using OpenMP for parallel computing, it achieves significant speed-ups in electron-ion pair generation and space charge field calculations. Practically, an eight-RPC stack was developed at VECC to measure cosmic muon scattering angles in high-density materials. A testbench evaluates efficiency, crosstalk, and hit uniformity. A reconstruction algorithm, validated with data from the IICHEP stack in Madurai, supports the VECC stack's potential. This work enhances neutrino physics understanding and advances RPC-based detection technologies.

2025-07-29, **Supernova cooling from neutrino-devouring dark matter**, Yugen Lin et.al., [2507.22124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22124v1)

 Supernova cooling provides a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), in particular for new, light states interacting feebly with SM particles. In this work, we investigate for the first time the production of fermionic dark matter (DM) via the neutrino-devouring process inside a core-collapse supernova, which contributes to the excessive cooling. By incorporating state-of-the-art supernova simulation data and the full time evolution information, we derive stringent and robust limits on DM interactions. We exclude the cross sections down to $10^{-51}-10^{-58}$ cm$^2$ in the keV-MeV mass range for DM-electron scattering, and $10^{-49}-10^{-56}$ cm$^2$ in the 0.1-100 MeV mass range for DM-nucleon scattering, supplemented by complementary constraints from cosmology, astrophysics, LHC and direct detection experiments in the larger cross section regime. We also close almost the entire window in which fermionic DM constitutes $\mathcal{O}(1)$ fraction of DM for its coupling to electrons in the keV-MeV mass range.

2025-07-29, **Two-neutrino $ββ$ decay to excited states at next-to-leading order**, Daniel Castillo et.al., [2507.21868v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21868v1)

 We study two-neutrino double-beta decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) into first-excited $0^+\_2$ states of nuclei used in $\beta\beta$ decay experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe. We calculate the corresponding nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) within the nuclear shell model, using various Hamiltonians that describe well the spectroscopy of the initial and final nuclei. We evaluate the next-to-leading order (NLO) long-range NMEs recently introduced within chiral effective field theory, keeping three terms in the expansion of the energy denominator. In most cases, NLO contributions to the half-life are below 5%, but they can increase to 25% due to cancellations in the leading-order Gamow-Teller NME. A detailed analysis in terms of nuclear deformation, including triaxiality, indicates that larger deformation differences between the initial and final states generally lead to smaller NMEs, but the seniority structure of the states also plays a relevant role. The lower range of our predicted half-lives, with uncertainties dominated by the nuclear Hamiltonian used, are slightly longer than the current experimental limit in $^{76}$Ge and the very recent half-life indication in $^{82}$Se.

2025-07-29, **Gamma rays as leptonic portals to energetic neutrinos: a new Monte Carlo approach**, Gaetano Di Marco et.al., [2507.21867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21867v1)

 High center-of-mass electromagnetic~(EM) interactions could produce decaying heavy leptons and hadrons, leading to neutrino generation. These processes might occur in the most extreme astrophysical scenarios, potentially altering the expected gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes in both the hadronic and the leptonic pictures. For instance, neutrinos could arise from high-redshift EM cascades, triggered by gamma rays beyond $10^{18} \; \text{eV}$ scattering background photons, from radio to ultraviolet energy bands. Such energetic gamma rays are predicted in cosmogenic models and in scenarios involving non-standard physics. On astrophysical scales, leptonic production of neutrinos could take place in active galactic nuclei cores, where several-TeV gamma rays interact with the X-ray photons from the hot corona. We explore these scenarios within the CRPropa Monte Carlo code framework, developing dedicated tools to account for leptonic production and decay of heavy leptons and hadrons. In particular, the latter are performed by interfacing with the PYTHIA event generator. With these novel tools, we characterise the spectrum and flavour composition of neutrinos emerging from cosmological EM cascades and from leptonic processes in the core of active galactic nuclei. Finally, we investigate the leptonic production of neutrinos in the context of the IceCube detection of NGC~1068.

2025-07-29, **Neutrino non-radiative decay in matter: constraints and prospects**, Pilar Iváñez-Ballesteros et.al., [2507.21845v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21845v1)

 Neutrinos, being massive, can decay. A heavier neutrino could decay into a lighter one and a massless scalar or pseudoscalar boson, such as the Majoron. Two-body non-radiative decay could occur in dense matter, such as in the inner dense regions of a core-collapse supernova. We first derive novel bounds on neutrino-Majoron couplings using the spectral distortions induced by neutrino non-radiative two-body decay in matter, and two-dimensional likelihood analyses of the 24 $\bar{\nu}\_e$ events from SN1987A. We then explore the prospects of neutrino-Majoron couplings from a future galactic core-collapse supernova, leaving either a neutron star or a black-hole. To this aim, we use information from detailed one-dimensional supernova simulations. We consider the supernova neutrino signal associated with inverse-beta decay in the upcoming JUNO and Hyper-Kamiokande detectors, with neutrino-argon scattering in DUNE, or with coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering in the DARWIN experiment. In a full 3$\nu$ framework, based on the spectral distortions induced by neutrino decay in matter, we perform two-dimensional likelihood analyses and provide prospects for the limits on neutrino-Majoron couplings. Our results show that the observation of a future supernova will significantly improve on the current bounds, in particular from SN1987A and neutrinoless double-beta decay. Finally, we explore the impact of neutrino decay in matter on the diffuse supernova neutrino background formed by past supernova explosions. We show for the first time that the effects on black-hole contributions are important and modify the DSNB number of events by several tens of percent in Hyper-Kamiokande.

2025-07-29, **One-loop Renormalization of the Type-I Seesaw Model in the Modified Minimal-subtraction Scheme**, Jihong Huang et.al., [2507.21691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21691v1)

 Extending the Standard Model (SM) with three right-handed neutrinos, the type-I seesaw model serves as the simplest and most natural scenario to successfully explain both tiny neutrino masses and the baryon number asymmetry in the Universe. In this paper, we perform a complete one-loop renormalization of the type-I seesaw model in the modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\rm MS}$) scheme. The one-loop self-energy corrections of charged leptons and Majorana neutrinos are calculated in the $R\_\xi^{}$ gauge, and the explicit expressions of all the counterterms for wave functions, fermion masses and the leptonic flavor mixing matrix are given. Furthermore, adopting the Euler-like parametrization of the $6\times 6$ unitary leptonic flavor mixing matrix, we derive one-loop renormalization-group equations for all the physical parameters in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme, including neutrino masses, mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The modification of the one-loop renormalization of the original SM parameters due to the presence of heavy Majorana neutrinos is investigated as well. In this way, we provide a self-consistent theoretical framework to thoroughly test the type-I seesaw model at the one-loop level with future precision data.

2025-07-29, **Interpreting the KM3-230213A PeV Neutrino Event via Vector Dark Matter Decay and Its Multi-Messenger Signatures**, Yu-Hang Su et.al., [2507.21534v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21534v2)

 The KM3NeT Collaboration recently reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A with a reconstructed energy of $220^{+570}\_{-110}$ PeV, the most energetic astrophysical neutrino ever detected. The absence of convincing electromagnetic counterparts motivates exploration of exotic origins beyond standard astrophysical processes. We present a vector dark matter model based on a new $U(1)\_X$ gauge symmetry to interpret this event through superheavy dark matter decay. Our analysis demonstrates that dark matter lifetimes in the range $7.3 \times 10^{28}$ to $2.9 \times 10^{30}$ s can successfully account for the KM3-230213A event while satisfying stringent constraints from gamma-ray observations. Moreover, the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)\_X$ in our model naturally predicts cosmic string formation, generating a stochastic gravitational wave background with string tension $4.5 \times 10^{-11} \lesssim G\mu \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$, consistent with recent pulsar timing array observations. This multi-messenger consistency across neutrinos, gamma-rays, and gravitational waves validates our vector dark matter interpretation of the KM3-230213A event while providing testable predictions for upcoming multi-wavelength experiments.

2025-07-30, **From Capture to Collapse: Revisiting Black Hole formation by Fermionic Asymmetric Dark Matter in Neutron Stars**, Sandra Robles et.al., [2507.22881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22881v1)

 Fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can be captured in neutron stars (NSs) via scatterings with the star constituents. The absence of dark matter annihilation due to its asymmetric nature leads to ADM accumulation in the NS core, potentially reaching densities sufficient to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and trigger its gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH), eventually consuming the NS from within. Therefore, the existence and observation of old neutron stars provides a means to constrain the properties of ADM. We revisit previous constraints on the mass and scattering cross section off neutrons of fermionic ADM across a class of models. We critically examine common simplifying approximations used in the literature to derive these limits. Our analysis includes improved treatments of dark matter capture, thermalization, BH formation, accretion, and evaporation. We find that previous results can be relaxed by a few orders of magnitude once these effects are properly accounted for.

2025-07-30, **Euclid: Forecasts on $Λ$CDM consistency tests with growth rate data**, I. Ocampo et.al., [2507.22780v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22780v1)

 The large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe is an important probe for deviations from the canonical cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. A statistically significant detection of any deviations would signify the presence of new physics or the breakdown of any number of the underlying assumptions of the standard cosmological model or possible systematic errors in the data. In this paper, we quantify the ability of the LSS data products of the spectroscopic survey of the Euclid mission, together with other contemporary surveys, to improve the constraints on deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the redshift range $0<z<1.75$. We consider both currently available growth rate data and simulated data with specifications from Euclid and external surveys, based on $\Lambda$CDM and a modified gravity (MoG) model with an evolving Newton's constant (denoted $\mu$CDM), and carry out a binning method and a machine learning reconstruction, based on genetic algorithms (GAs), of several LSS null tests. Using the forecast Euclid growth data from the spectroscopic survey in the range $0.95<z<1.75$, we find that in combination with external data products (covering the range $0<z<0.95$), Euclid will be able to improve on current constraints of null tests of the LSS on average by a factor of eight when using a binning method and a factor of six when using the GAs. Our work highlights the need for synergies between Euclid and other surveys, but also the usefulness of statistical analyses, such as GAs, in order to disentangle any degeneracies in the cosmological parameters. Both are necessary to provide tight constraints over an extended redshift range and to probe for deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model.

2025-07-30, **SOAP: A Python Package for Calculating the Properties of Galaxies and Halos Formed in Cosmological Simulations**, Robert McGibbon et.al., [2507.22669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22669v1)

 Modern large scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations require robust tools capable of analysing their data outputs in a parallel and efficient manner. We introduce SOAP (Spherical Overdensity and Aperture Processor), a Python package designed to compute halo and galaxy properties from SWIFT simulations after being post-processed with a subhalo finder. SOAP takes a subhalo catalogue as input and calculates a wide array of properties for each object. SOAP offers parallel processing capabilities via mpi4py for efficient handling of large datasets, and allows for consistent property calculation across multiple halo finders. SOAP supports various halo definitions, including spherical overdensities and fixed physical apertures, providing flexibility for diverse observational comparisons. The package is compatible with both dark matter-only and full hydrodynamic simulations, producing HDF5 catalogues that are integrated with the swiftsimio package for seamless unit handling.

2025-07-30, **The Major Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes (MAGIC)**, Oscar Blanch et.al., [2507.22585v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22585v1)

 The MAGIC telescopes, located at Observatorio El Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) are two Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes observing the Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays. They are run by an international collaboration composed of over 40 institutions from 12 countries. The first telescope was inaugurated in October 2003. The commissioning of the second finished in 2008. The MAGIC telescopes were designed to lower the energies to which ground based telescopes had access as well as to be able to point to any direction in the sky in less than 25 seconds. The former required the large reflective surface of 17 meters as well as an effort to optimise the mirror reflectivity and photo sensor sensitivity. The latter was achieved by minimising the weight of the full instrument using for instance carbon fibre reinforced plastic tubes for the mirror frame. The sensitivity of the MAGIC telescopes have been improving over the years thanks to hardware upgrades as well as new analysis techniques, which allowed the collaboration to keep a rich scientific program. The discovery of VHE emission from Gamma Ray Bursts and pulsars have called for a revision of the models that explain the production of gamma rays there. Both the observation of sources in flaring state as well as a systematic monitoring of sources have provided valuable data to better understand astrophysical sources both in our Galaxy and outside it. Relevant constraints on fundamental quantities like dark matter cross-section, quantum gravity scale and density of extragalactic background light have also been extracted from the observations.

2025-07-30, **Darksuite: an Algorithm for Dark Matter-Admixed Neutron Stars**, Nguyen Thi Lan Anh et.al., [2507.22415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22415v1)

 Gravitational-wave observations provide a unique window into the fundamental nature of massive objects. In particular, neutron star equations of state have been constrained due to the success of gravitational wave observatories. Recently, the possibility of detecting dark matter-admixed neutron stars via ground-based laser interferometry has been explored. Dark matter would impact the gravitational waveform of an inspiraling neutron star system through tidal parameters, namely the tidal deformability ($\lambda$, incurring a phase shift to the frequency evolution of the signal. This phase shift would depend both on the percentage of dark matter within the star and its particle nature, e.g., bosonic or fermionic. Indirect detection of dark matter through admixture within neutron stars can provide insight into the neutron equation of state, as well as constraints on the density of dark matter in the universe. In this work, we introduce \texttt{Darksuite}, a proposed extension of the \lal{} software framework, designed to model the gravitational wave signatures of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars. This framework employs simulations from the two-fluid, generally relativistic Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, wherein one fluid is ordinary nuclear matter and the other is dark matter. We demonstrate interpolation of values from a bank of simulations, enabling the study of binary systems where at least one component may be a dark-matter-admixed neutron star. By leveraging existing methodologies within \lal{} for tidal phase corrections and supplementing them with dark matter effects, \texttt{Darksuite} provides a means to generate and analyze gravitational waveforms for these exotic systems.

2025-07-30, **Streams and Shells Decoded: A Density-Driven Approach to Stellar Clustering in Galactic Halos with AstroLink**, Viraj Ekanayaka et.al., [2507.22333v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22333v1)

 We present a novel method to differentiate stream-like and shell-like tidal remnants of stellar systems in galactic halos using the density-based approach of the clustering algorithm AstroLink. While previous studies lean on observation, phase-space, and action-space based criteria for stream and shell determination, we introduce AstroLink's ordered-density plot and cluster identification as a viable tool for classification. For a given data set, the AstroLink ordered-density plot reveals the density-based hierarchical clustering structure from which the resultant clusters are identified as being statistically significant overdensities. Using simulations of sub-halo disruptions in an external potential to generate samples of tidal structures, we find that the curvature of the ordered-density plot is positive for stream-like structures and negative for shell-like structures. Comparisons with more standard classification techniques reveal strong agreement on which structures typically fit into stream-like and shell-like categories. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of clustered stream and shell samples in radial phase space and energy-angle space. Given the sensitivity of stellar tidal structures to their host dark matter halos, the identification and subsequent classification of these structures provide exciting avenues of investigation in galactic evolution dynamics and dark matter structure formation.

2025-07-29, **Cusp-to-Core Transition of Dark Matter Halos across Galaxy Mass Scales**, Kohei Hayashi et.al., [2507.22155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22155v1)

 We investigate the diversity of dark matter (DM) density profiles in a large sample of late-type galaxies from the SPARC database, with the goal of testing whether a cusp-to-core transition occurs across galaxy mass scales. We perform Bayesian fits to high-quality rotation curves using flexible halo models that allow for variations in the inner slopes of DM density profiles. We quantify the central dark matter structure using the surface density within the inner region of the halo, defined as $\Sigma\_{\rm DM}(<0.01r\_{V\_{\rm max}})$, and compare the SPARC galaxies with Milky Way dwarf satellites as well as galaxy groups and clusters. Our results reveal significant diversity in the inner density slopes of SPARC galaxies, ranging from steep cusps to shallow cores, and show that many of them lie below the cuspy profiles predicted by the cold dark matter model, consistent with core-like structures. In contrast, both lower-mass dwarf galaxies and higher-mass galaxy clusters tend to follow the cuspy DM halos. These findings suggest that baryonic feedback may induce a cusp-to-core transition in Milky Way-mass galaxies, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. However, observational limitations and modeling uncertainties still prevent a definitive conclusion. This study provides new empirical insights into the halo mass-dependent nature of DM inner structures and the role of baryonic processes in shaping them.

2025-07-29, **Gravitational Wave Burst from Bremsstrahlung in Milky Way Can Discover Sub-Solar Dark Matter in Near Future**, Samsuzzaman Afroz et.al., [2507.22126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22126v1)

 What is Dark Matter, and what is its concentration in the Milky Way remains an open question in physics. We show that if a significant fraction of dark matter is composed of sub-solar mass primordial black holes (PBHs), gravitational bremsstrahlung resulting from hyperbolic encounters between unbound PBHs within the galactic halos can generate distinctive chromatic gravitational-wave (GW) emission concentrated around the galactic dark matter halo, and it provides a direct window to discover such compact objects. We find that for both generalized NFW and Einasto dark matter profiles of Milky Way, the signal-to-noise ratio can be more than five in one year of observation for the upcoming ground based GW observatories Cosmic Explorer if PBH dark matter fraction $f\_{\rm PBH} = 1$ over the mass range $10^{-14} M\_\odot \lesssim m\_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-8} M\_\odot$. Our results show that the Galactic Center could appear as a GW-bright source, enabling new insights into dark matter and its distribution.

2025-07-29, **Upper Bound on Parity Breaking Scale for Doublet WIMP Dark Matter**, Matthew J. Baldwin et.al., [2507.22113v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22113v1)

 We consider weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter in a Parity solution to the strong CP problem. The WIMP phenomenology can be drastically affected by the presence of Parity partners of the WIMP and electroweak gauge bosons. We focus on a Parity extension of $SU(2)\_L$-doublet fermion dark matter, identify the viable parameter space, and derive the predictions of the theory. We find that the Parity symmetry breaking scale is bounded from above, with the bound given by $25-60$ TeV, depending on whether or not dark matter and its Parity partner coannihilate with each other. The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, future colliders, and direct and indirect detection experiments can probe the parameter space further, with correlated signal rates.

2025-07-29, **The goofy-symmetric Standard Model and the Hierarchy Problem**, Thede de Boer et.al., [2507.22111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22111v1)

 A new class of so-called "goofy" symmetries has been shown to lead to renormalization-group stable relations between parameters in two-Higgs-Doublet Models, not known before. In this work we investigate goofy transformations in the Standard Model (SM), extending them to the fermion sector. We show that the SM action is goofy "symmetric", if the Higgs mass term vanishes, while other SM interactions are allowed. Goofy symmetry could thus add another option to the very few means to successfully forbid the Higgs mass term, providing an alternative to conformal symmetry or shift symmetry. We further consider how electroweak symmetry breaking can be realized in the goofy symmetric SM via higher dimensional operators or an extended scalar sector. A viable Higgs mass can be obtained via spontaneous breaking of goofy symmetry, which can be realized via operators that would not be allowed by shift symmetry or conformal symmetry. We find that goofy-symmetric extensions of the SM are strongly constrained, but offer for example a straightforward dark matter candidate.

2025-07-29, **One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters**, Thomas Bakx et.al., [2507.22110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22110v1)

 We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k\_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega\_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H\_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma\_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f\_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega\_{\text{cdm}}$, $H\_0$, and $\sigma\_8$ shrinking by 43\%, 31\%, and 4\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.

2025-07-29, **Auriga Superstars: Improving the resolution and fidelity of stellar dynamics in cosmological galaxy simulations**, Ruediger Pakmor et.al., [2507.22104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22104v1)

 Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have become an indispensable tool to understand galaxies. However, computational constraints still severely limit their numerical resolution. This not only restricts the sampling of the stellar component and its direct comparison to detailed observations, but also the precision with which it is evolved. To overcome these problems we introduce the \emph{Superstars} method. This method increases the stellar mass resolution in cosmological galaxy simulations in a computationally inexpensive way for a fixed dark matter and gas resolution without altering any global properties of the simulated galaxies. We demonstrate the \emph{Superstars} method for a Milky Way-like galaxy of the Auriga project, improving the stellar mass resolution by factors of $8$ and $64$. We show and quantify that this improves the sampling of the stellar population in the disc and halo without changing the properties of the central galaxy or its satellites, unlike simulations that change the resolution of all components (gas, dark matter, stars). Moreover, the better stellar mass resolution reduces numerical heating of the stellar disc in its outskirts and keeps substructures in the stellar disc and inner halo more coherent. It also makes lower mass and lower surface brightness structures in the stellar halo more visible. The \emph{Superstars} method is straightforward to incorporate in any cosmological galaxy simulation that does not resolve individual stars.

 In this study, we define the novel splashback depth $\mathcal{D}$ and width $\mathcal{W}$ to examine how the splashback features of dark matter haloes are affected by the physical properties of haloes themselves. We use the largest simulation run in the hydrodynamic MillenniumTNG project. By stacking haloes in bins of halo mass, redshift, mass-dependent properties such as peak height and concentration, and halo formation history, we measure the shape of the logarithmic slope of the density profile of dark matter haloes. Our results show that the splashback depth has a strong dependence on the halo mass which follows a power law $\mathcal{D}\propto\left(\log\_{10}M\right)^{2.8}$. Properties with strong correlation with halo mass demonstrate similar dependence. The splashback width has the strongest dependence on halo peak height and follows a power law $\mathcal{W}\propto\nu^{-0.87}$. We provide the fitting functions of the splashback depth and width in terms of halo mass, redshift, peak height, concentrations and halo formation time. The depth and width are therefore considered to be a long term memory tracker of haloes since they depend more on accumulative physical properties, e.g., halo mass, peak height and halo formation time. They are shaped primarily by the halo's assembly history, which exerts a stronger influence on the inner density profile than short-term dynamical processes. In contrast, the splashback features have little dependence on the short term factors such as halo mass accretion rate and most recent major merger time. The splashback depth and width can therefore be used to complement information gained from quantities like the point of steepest slope or truncation radius to characterise the halo's history and inner structure.

 The nature of dark matter remains one of the most pressing open questions in modern cosmology. Despite extensive experimental efforts, no direct or indirect detection of dark matter particles has been confirmed. This has motivated alternative approaches, including modifications to the underlying theory of gravity. In this work, we investigate the implications of a specific non-local gravity (NLG) theory, which modifies General Relativity by introducing non-local effects that manifest as an effective dark matter component. We analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of eight classical dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies - Carina, Draco, Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, Sculptor, Sextans, and Ursa Minor - to test the predictions of NLG. Using the Jeans equation, we model the kinematics of these galaxies and perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to constrain the parameters of the NLG kernel chosen for our analysis. Our results indicate that NLG might successfully reproduce the observed kinematics of dSph galaxies without requiring particle dark matter, providing constraints on the scale-dependent modifications to gravity that are compatible with previous studies in the literature. However, a parameter inconsistency remains in the cases of Fornax and Sextans galaxies that requires further attention.

2025-07-29, **BSM: Extended Scalar Sectors**, Tania Robens et.al., [2507.21910v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21910v1)

 In particle physics the world is described by a function, the Lagrangian. Each of its sectors characterizes the interactions between the particles of the Standard Model (SM). The addition of hypothetical new particles is done by including new terms in the Lagrangian. The scalar or Higgs sector of the SM is built with only one scalar complex field and it is extended by including new spin zero fields. This can help to solve questions that cannot be answered by the SM alone, like introducing dark matter candidates or new sources of CP-violation required to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. The corresponding theories have to be probed experimentally. For the high energy region, the standard tools are collider experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider, or other possible future facilities. Dark matter experiments scrutinize the connection between the visible and the dark world.

2025-07-29, **First use of large area SiPM matrices coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillating crystal for low energy dark matter search**, Edoardo Martinenghi et.al., [2507.21612v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21612v1)

 The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors, which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic radioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first experimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The photoelectron yield obtained with a preliminary configuration is 7.2 photoelectrons/keV, which is rather promising, also in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale experiments.

 Regular black holes, nonsingular solutions to gravitational collapse with quantum corrections, offer a compelling alternative to classical black holes with curvature singularities. In this work, we investigate how the presence of skewed dark matter distributions outside the innermost stable circular orbit of regular black holes modifies the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects. Rather than introducing corrections directly into an effective potential, we model the influence of dark matter through metric corrections, allowing a full control over the spatial distribution and abundance of dark matter. We demonstrate that a skewed normal profile generically introduces shallow potential wells or secondary barriers in the effective potential of perturbation equations, depending sensitively on the type of perturbations: scalar, spinor, or tensor. These modifications lead to distinctive quasinormal mode features, including long-lived modes, echo effects, and in some cases, altered stability behaviors. Notably, the axial and polar sectors of tensor field perturbations respond asymmetrically to identical dark matter profiles, revealing a deeper structural distinction in their perturbation dynamics. These results provide a theoretical framework for probing regular black holes in the dark matter environment through gravitational wave observations.

 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will soon survey the southern sky, delivering a depth and sky coverage that is unprecedented in time domain astronomy. As part of commissioning, Data Preview 1 (DP1) has been released. It comprises a ComCam observing campaign between November and December 2024 with multi-band imaging of seven fields, covering roughly 0.4 square degree each, provides a first glimpse into the data products that will become available once the Legacy Survey of Space and Time begins. In this work, we search three fields for extragalactic transients. We identify six new extragalactic transients, and three known ones from a sample of 369,644 difference image analysis objects. Photometric classification using \texttt{Superphot+} indicates that this sample likely comprises six type Ia, two type II, two type Ibc and one type IIn supernovae. Our findings are in slight tension with supernova detection rate predictions from the literature of $12\pm3$ SN Ia and $3\pm1$ core-collapse supernovae likely due to the lack of suitable templates. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates the quality of the data products delivered in DP1 and indicates that Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey and Space and Time (LSST) is well placed to fulfill its discovery potential in time domain astronomy.

2025-07-30, **Is this the fall of the $Λ$CDM throne? Evidence for dynamical dark energy rising from combinations of different types of datasets**, Mustapha Ishak et.al., [2507.22856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22856v1)

 We derive multiple constraints on dark energy and compare dynamical dark energy models with a time-varying equation of state ($w\_0 w\_a$CDM) versus a cosmological constant model ($\Lambda$CDM). We use Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) from DESI and DES, Cosmic Microwave Background (Planck) with and without lensing from Planck and ACT (noted CMB and CMBL, respectively), supernova (SN), and cross-correlations between galaxy positions and galaxy lensing from DES. First, we use pairs or trios of datasets where we exclude one type of datasets each time and categorize them as ``NO SN", ``NO CMB" and ``NO BAO" combinations. In all cases, we find that the combinations favor the $w\_0 w\_a$CDM model over $\Lambda$CDM, with significance ranging from 2.3$\sigma$ to 3.3$\sigma$. For example, DESI+DESY6BAO+CMB yields 3.2$\sigma$ without SN, DESI+DESY6BAO+DESY5SN yields 3.3$\sigma$ without CMB, and CMB+DESY5SN+DES3x2pts yields 2.6$\sigma$ without BAO. The persistence of this pattern across various dataset combinations even when any of the dataset is excluded supports an overall validation of this trending result regardless of any specific dataset. Next, we use larger combinations of these datasets after verifying their mutual consistency within the $w\_0 w\_a$CDM model. We find combinations that give significance levels $\sim$4$\sigma$, with DESI+DESY6BAO+CMBL+DESY5SN reaching 4.4$\sigma$. In sum, while we need to remain prudent, the combination of the first step that supports a validation of the pattern of these results beyond any single type of datasets and their associated systematics, together with the second step showing high-significance results when such datasets are combined, presents a compelling overall portrait in favor of a dynamical dark energy with a time-evolving equation of state over a cosmological constant, and constitutes a serious challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model's reign.

2025-07-30, **The nebular phase of SN 2024ggi: a low-mass progenitor with no signs of interaction**, L. Ferrari et.al., [2507.22794v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22794v1)

 Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\approx6.7\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M\_\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M\_\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.

2025-07-30, **Confined Circumstellar Material as a Dust Formation Site in Type II Supernovae**, Yuki Takei et.al., [2507.22763v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22763v1)

 We propose a model for dust formation in Type II supernovae (SNe) interacting with confined circumstellar material (CSM), motivated by recent time-domain surveys that have revealed a substantial fraction of SN progenitors to be surrounded by CSM ejected shortly before core-collapse. We simulate the pre-SN mass eruption and the resulting confined CSM using the open-source code CHIPS, and follow the subsequent evolution of the SN ejecta and its interaction with the CSM. We show that a cold dense shell (CDS) is formed at the radiative shock under a wide range of conditions and later undergoes rapid adiabatic cooling during free expansion, leading to efficient dust condensation. The resulting dust mass ranges from $\sim10^{-3}\,M\_\odot$ to $0.1\,M\_\odot$, depending on the mass and spatial extent of the CSM. We further calculate the infrared (IR) emission from the newly formed dust and find broad consistency with observations of SN~1998S. Notably, the IR light curve exhibits a rapid rise within $\lesssim10\,{\rm d}$, closely resembling that of kilonovae (KNe). This suggests that dust emission powered by confined CSM interaction may be also discovered in KN searches. Moreover, the high-density environment of the CDS may allow dust grains to grow to larger sizes, enhancing their survivability against destruction by reverse shocks propagating from the interstellar medium at later times.

 We revisit the evolution of cosmic acceleration in a spatially flat $w\_0w\_a$CDM universe, in which the equation of state of dark energy takes the CPL parametrization, using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), in combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and several type Ia supernova datasets, including PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5. We analyze the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ and the jerk parameter $j(z)$ and further validate our results using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. Our findings indicate significant deviations from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Specifically, DESI BAO, DESI BAO + CMB, DESI BAO + CMB + Union3, and DESI BAO + CMB + DESY5 all provide strong evidence for a slowing down of cosmic acceleration at late times, as indicated by $j(0) < 0$ at more than 1$\sigma$ confidence level, within the framework of $w\_0w\_a$CDM model. These results suggest that in the $w\_0w\_a$CDM universe cosmic acceleration has already peaked and is now in a phase of decline.

2025-07-30, **The Binary Fraction of B-type Runaway Stars from LAMOST DR8**, Kun Chen et.al., [2507.22569v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22569v1)

 Runaway stars are defined as stars that depart from their birth clusters at high peculiar velocities. There are two main mechanisms for the formation of runaway stars, i.e., the binary-supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical ejection scenario (DES). Investigating the binary fraction of runaway stars is an important step in further exploring the relative significance of the two mechanisms. We analyzed the binary fraction of 203 Galactic B-type runaway stars identified in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 8 database. Our analysis of radial velocity variations in the runaway star sample reveals an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of $5.4\%\pm 1.6\%$, representing the proportion of objects that exhibit statistically significant variations in radial velocity with amplitudes larger than $\rm 16~km~s^{-1}$. We employed a Monte Carlo method to correct for observational biases and determined an intrinsic binary fraction of $27\%\pm 8\%$. The period and mass ratio distributions that best reproduce the observation are $f(P)\propto P^{-5.7}$ for $1\leq P\leq 1000$ days, and $f(q)\propto q^{-3.6}$ for $0.1\leq q\leq 1.0$, indicating a preference for binaries with shorter periods and less massive companions compared to a uniform distribution. The intrinsic binary fraction, in combination with previous studies on the binary fractions of runaway stars formed by the BSS and the DES, implies that both scenarios contribute comparably to the formation of Galactic B-type runaway stars, where the ratio of the BSS to the DES is 0.86.

 In this work, we explore the generalized holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario. We relate the HDE density to the future-horizon scale via a function $f(a)$, which we reconstruct via spline-based nodal interpolation. We perform a Bayesian analysis to assess model's consistency with current observations, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Union3 and Pantheon+ compilations, and local measurements of the Hubble constant, $H\_0$, from SH0ES. We show that under specific conditions, the model reduces to $\Lambda$CDM with one node. We find strong statistical evidence against the standard HDE model $\Delta \chi^2\_{\rm HDE, \; 3\text{-Node}} \sim 20$, and in contrast, the reconstructed HDE model, with three nodes, provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model, specifically, $\Delta \chi^2\_{\Lambda \rm CDM, \; 3\text{-Node}} \sim 12$.

2025-07-29, **Probing Turbulence, Gravity, Supernovae, and Magnetic Field Effects with the 6D Kinematics of Young Stars in Milky Way Star-Forming Regions**, Benjamin N. Velguth et.al., [2507.22107v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22107v1)

 The dynamics of star forming gas can be affected by many physical processes, such as turbulence, gravity, supernova explosions, and magnetic fields. In this paper, we investigate several nearby star forming regions (Orion, Upper Sco, Taurus, and Perseus) for kinematic imprints of these influences on the newly formed stars. Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and APOGEE DR17 radial velocities, we compute first-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) of young stars in galactic Cartesian coordinates in both 6D (3D positions and 3D velocities) and 4D (3D positions and each 1D velocity) to identify signatures of turbulence and anisotropic motion. We also construct 3D and 1D radial velocity profiles to identify coherent expansion trends, and compare stellar proper motions to plane-of-sky magnetic field orientations in Taurus and Perseus. We find that the VSFs are mildly anisotropic, with slightly different amplitudes, slopes, or features in different directions in several groups, but in general, they are all consistent with Larson's Relation at intermediate length scales, especially in less compact groups. In several cases, the VSFs exhibit features suggestive of local energy injection from supernovae. Radial velocity profiles reveal clear anisotropic expansion in multiple groups, with the most extreme cases corresponding to those with the most anisotropic VSFs. In Perseus, we find that the motions of young stars are preferentially perpendicular to the local magnetic field. We find multiple, overlapping causes in each group for the observed kinematics. Our findings support that young stars remember more than just the turbulent state of their natal clouds.

 While significant advances have been made in photometric classification ahead of the millions of transient events and hundreds of supernovae (SNe) each night that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover, classifying SNe spectroscopically remains the best way to determine most subtypes of SNe. Traditional spectrum classification tools use template matching techniques (Blondin & Tonry 2007) and require significant human supervision. Two deep learning spectral classifiers, DASH (Muthukrishna et al. 2019) and SNIascore (Fremling et al. 2021) define the state of the art, but SNIascore is a binary classifier devoted to maximizing the purity of the SN Ia-norm sample, while DASH is no longer maintained and the original work suffers from contamination of multi-epoch spectra in the training and test sets. We have explored several neural network architectures in order to create a new automated method for classifying SN subtypes, settling on an attention-based model we call ABC-SN. We benchmark our results against an updated version of DASH, thus providing the community with an up-to-date general purpose SN classifier. Our dataset includes ten different SN subtypes including subtypes of SN Ia, core collapse and interacting SNe. We find that ABC-SN outperforms DASH, and we discuss the possibility that modern SN spectra datasets contain label noise which limit the performance of all classifiers.

2025-07-29, **On the formation of strange quark stars from supernova in compact binaries**, L. M. Becerra et.al., [2507.22033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22033v1)

 Strange quark stars (SQSs), namely compact stars entirely composed of deconfined quark matter, are characterized by similar masses and compactness to neutron stars (NSs) and have been theoretically proposed to exist in the Universe since the 1970s. However, multiwavelength observations of compact stars in the last 50 years have not yet led to an unambiguous SQS identification. This article explores whether SQSs could form in the supernova (SN) explosion of an evolved star (e.g., carbon-oxygen, or Wolf-Rayet) occurring in a binary with the companion being a neutron star (NS). The collapse of the iron core of the evolved star generates a newborn NS and the SN explosion. Part of the ejected matter accretes onto the NS companion as well as onto the newborn NS via matter fallback. The accretion occurs at hypercritical (highly super-Eddington) rates, transferring mass and angular momentum to the stars. We present numerical simulations of this scenario and demonstrate that the density increase in the NS interiors during the accretion process may induce quark matter deconfinement, suggesting the possibility of SQS formation. We discuss the astrophysical conditions under which such a transformation may occur and possible consequences.

2025-07-29, **Tidal heating in detached double white dwarf binaries**, Lucy O. McNeill et.al., [2507.21821v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21821v1)

 Short--period ($P<$1 hr orbits) detached double white dwarf binary (DWDB) components identified with transient surveys (e.g. SDSS, ZTF) have hot surface temperatures ($>$10,000 K) and observed radii a factor two larger than completely degenerate white dwarfs. We formulate tidal heating in helium composition extremely low mass white dwarf (ELM WD) components of detached DWDBs which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass radius relation which varies with surface temperature and the tidal friction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal friction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and hence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of binaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up to $\sim$40\% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white dwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for the oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day. In the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer should occur at orbital periods as long as 1000s (17 minutes), or binary gravitational wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over three times longer than periods expected for degenerate WD (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs are progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations e.g. RCrB stars, AM CVn binaries, type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor white dwarfs should be taken into account.

2025-07-29, **Does DESI DR2 challenge $Λ$CDM paradigm ?**, Himanshu Chaudhary et.al., [2507.21607v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21607v1)

 Although the debate about the systematic errors of DESI DR1 is still open, recent DESI DR2 is consistent with DESI DR1 and further strengthens the results of DESI DR1. In this analysis, we present a $\sim 2.38 \sigma$ discrepancy between Planck $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology and the DESI DR2 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG1) data at $z\_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$, which predicts an unexpectedly large value for $\Omega\_m$, $\Omega\_m = 0.471^{+0.119}\_{-0.065}$. We find that the $w\_0 w\_a$CDM model, using DESI DR2 data, suggests $w\_0 > 1$, indicating a deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, where is strictly $w\_0 = -1$. Additionally, the DESI DR2 data reveals that the value of $\Omega\_m$ fluctuates at the 2.97 $\sigma$ level as redshift bin increases, particularly within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The DESI DR2 LRG1 data at $z\_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ seem to contradict the results from Type Ia supernovae in the same redshift range. However, it is expected that this discrepancy will become less significant with future DESI data releases, and the trend for $\Omega\_m$ is expected to continue to increase as higher redshifts are considered. The statistical significance of this trend was approximately $1.8 \sigma$ when only the DESI DR1 data was considered, but, in the light of DESI DR2 data, the significance has decreased to about $0.52 \sigma$. Despite this reduction, the trend showing an increase in $\Omega\_m$ with higher redshifts remains, though with less statistical confidence. This highlights the importance of understanding why the DESI LRG1 data at $z\_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ appear to be an outlier in the determination of $\Omega\_m$.
