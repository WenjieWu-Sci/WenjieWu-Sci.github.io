2025-12-24, **Can Randomness lead to non-anarchical mixing angles ?**, Aadarsh Singh Sudhir K Vempati et.al., [2512.21202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21202v1)

 We revisit the proposal of Craig and Sutherland that Anderson localization in a disordered fermion theory space can generate small neutrino masses from TeV scale physics \citecraig2018exponential}. Building on this idea, we ask a broader question: can randomness in fermion mass parameters also give rise to nonanarchical neutrino mixing angles, and how does the answer depend on the geometry of the mass graph? To explore this, we analyse three representative geometries a nearest neighbour chain, a fully connected non local model, and the Petersen graph in both Dirac and Majorana neutrino realisations. In the regime of strong diagonal disorder, all geometries display robust localization and naturally generate the observed neutrino mass scale, with the corresponding flavour mixing angles reflecting the random localization centres and thus taking an anarchical form. In the regime of weak disorder, where localization is milder, and eigenmodes can exhibit quasidegeneracies, light neutrino masses can emerge through GIM-mechanismlike cancellations among the heavy states. The weak disorder with geometry dependent weak localization constitutes a distinct pathway to structured mixings within disordered theory spaces. Overall, our results delineate the regimes in which disorder driven mechanisms produce hierarchical masses and identify the conditions under which structured flavour mixing can arise.

2025-12-24, **Optimizing Sterile Neutrino Searches: Impact of Position Resolution in Short-Baseline Reactor Experiments**, Young Ju Ko et.al., [2512.20952v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20952v1)

 The impact of position resolution on the sensitivity of short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments searching for light sterile neutrinos is investigated. Detailed simulations are conducted to evaluate two detector configurations: a segmented detector and an opaque liquid scintillator (OLS) detector, each positioned at two candidate research reactor sites, HANARO and Kijang. For both detector types, pseudo-data are generated under realistic assumptions regarding neutrino flux, detector response, and background levels. Oscillation analyses are performed to estimate detector sensitivity, incorporating both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The results indicate that the OLS detector, owing to its superior position resolution, achieves leading sensitivity across a wide range of oscillation parameters, even under conservative experimental conditions. These findings underscore the potential of OLS technology as a highly effective approach for future sterile neutrino searches.

2025-12-24, **A novel realization of linear seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule with the assistance of $\mathbb Z_3$ symmetry**, Hiroshi Okada et.al., [2512.20891v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20891v1)

 We propose a novel realization of linear seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule with the assistance of $\mathbb Z\_3$ symmetry. In our framework, Dirac mass matrices are generated at one-loop level, dynamically breaking the non-invertible symmetry while the symmetry is invariant under the tree-level. In addition to the active neutrino masses, the model exhibits rich and testable phenomenology such as non-unitarity bound, lepton flavor violations, lepton anomalous magnetic moment, and dark matter candidate. After describing our model, we carry out numerical analysis and show some results for our physical parameters.

2025-12-23, **Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions from LLE-type R-parity Violation**, Fang Xu et.al., [2512.20704v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20704v1)

 We study neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) induced by the trilinear $LLE$ couplings in $R$-parity-violating supersymmetry in a split-family spectrum where third-generation sleptons can be comparatively light. We systematically classify the relevant coupling patterns, derive the corresponding effective interactions and NSI parameters, and confront the resulting parameter space with a broad set of experimental constraints. We find that percent-level NSI can be realized in selected channels, with the largest magnitudes reaching $\varepsilon\_{ee}\simeq 8\%$ and $\varepsilon\_{μμ}\simeq 3.8\%$, while other entries are typically restricted to the sub-percent level (including $\varepsilon\_{μτ}\simeq -0.3\%$ in the viable off-diagonal case). We also highlight the structural origin of the different constraint patterns between $\widetildeτ\_R$- and $\widetildeτ\_L$-mediated scenarios and comment on the relation to the Zee model.

2025-12-23, **The Sensitivity of PUEO to Cosmogenic Neutrinos and Exotic Physics Scenarios**, Angelina Sherman et.al., [2512.20594v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20594v1)

 Several observatories designed to detect ultrahigh-energy neutrinos are planned for the next decade. The most imminent of these is the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO), a long-duration balloon-based experiment that will provide unprecedented sensitivity to neutrinos with energies in the range of ~ 1 - 1000 EeV. In this work, we assess the scientific reach of PUEO. In particular, we evaluate the sensitivity of this observatory to cosmogenic neutrinos and, in turn, to the proton fraction of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray spectrum. We also consider the potential of PUEO to probe scenarios in which neutrinos are produced through the decays of ultraheavy dark matter particles or are radiated from cosmic strings. We find that PUEO will be able to constrain the proton composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays in scenarios that feature very strong source evolution and in which protons are accelerated to extremely high energies. Although gamma-ray observations are generally more sensitive to decaying particles than neutrino observations, PUEO is expected to set the strongest neutrino-detector constraints above 10^19 eV. PUEO will also provide the strongest constraints on some models of cosmic strings.

2025-12-23, **A possible solution to the gallium anomaly moving beyond the leptonic wave function factorization**, M. Cadeddu et.al., [2512.20560v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20560v1)

 For over thirty years, a $\sim20\%$ deficit, now exceeding $5σ$, has persisted between measured and predicted neutrino capture rates on $^{71}$Ga, as observed in radioactive source experiments (namely GALLEX, SAGE, and more recently BEST) using $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar. This long-standing discrepancy, referred to as the gallium anomaly, has posed a significant challenge to our understanding of both experimental methods and theoretical predictions. In this work, we revisit the theoretical calculation of the neutrino capture cross-section by moving beyond the standard treatment of the leptonic wave functions, revealing limitations in the commonly used factorization approach based on the detailed balance principle. Incorporating phenomenologically constrained Gamow-Teller transition densities, able to correctly reproduce the precisely measured half-life of $^{71}{\textrm{Ge}}$, we find that the revised cross-section can be significantly reduced, potentially resolving the gallium anomaly without invoking new physics.

2025-12-23, **Accelerator-Based Neutrino Beams**, Laura Fields et.al., [2512.20470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20470v1)

 Over the past six decades, accelerator-based neutrino beams have revolutionized particle physics. Neutrinos created with accelerators have been used to discover the muon neutrino and tau neutrinos was discovered and to confirm the existence of neutrino oscillations. More recently, long-baseline experiments have offered the first experimental hint of CP violation in the neutrino sector. Building and operating such beams is an enormous technical challenge, yet they remain our most versatile tool for studying neutrinos. With new experiments such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande, and ideas such as neutrino factories, the next generation of beams will address open questions about neutrino mass ordering, CP violation, and possible physics beyond the standard model.

2025-12-23, **Dirac Neutrinos and Gauged Lepton Number**, A. E. Cárcamo Hernández et.al., [2512.20428v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20428v1)

 We propose the first scotogenic neutrino mass model with gauged lepton number $U(1)\_L$, which is spontaneously broken by three units $ΔL=3$ down to a residual discrete gauge symmetry $\mathbb{Z}\_6$. The latter guarantees that neutrinos acquire tiny Dirac masses via a one-loop scotogenic mechanism, simultaneously stabilizing the lightest electrically neutral particle with non-trivial charge under the preserved $\mathbb{Z}\_6$ symmetry. In our model there is a scalar particle identified as weakly interacting massive particle dark matter (DM) candidate. We analyzed its compatibility with the existing data on direct DM detection experiments and the DM relic abundance. We also address charged lepton flavor violating decays in our model and find that their predicted rates are within the reach of current experimental sensitivity.

2025-12-24, **Search for Light Dark Matter in Rare Meson Decays**, Ze-Kun Liu et.al., [2512.21191v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21191v1)

 Current dark matter direct detection experiments have low sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter. In this work, we demonstrate that rare $B$ and $K$ meson decays with missing energy in the final state can serve as efficient probes in this mass range. We analyze a generic $Z^{\prime}$ portal dark matter model and derive upper limits on its parameters from experimental bounds on the rare $B$ and $K$ meson decays. Our results show that such meson decay processes provide complementary constraints to current direct detection experiments for sub-GeV dark matter, particularly for interaction forms mediated by dark matter momentum dependent operators.

2025-12-24, **Preliminary forecasting constraint on scalar charge with LISA in non-vacuum environments**, Tieguang Zi et.al., [2512.21186v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21186v1)

 We compute the gravitational wave signal from eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded within beyond-vacuum environments, where the secondary object carries a scalar charge and evolves in the presence of both an accretion disk and a dark matter halo. The waveform modification is derived by incorporating the scalar charge correcting the fluxes and orbital trajectories of the secondary. Our results indicate that, under suitable parameter configurations, the influence of the scalar charge on EMRIs waveform in such environments can be distinguished from that in vacuum spacetime. For the EMRIs signal modified by the astrophysical environments, the future space-borne detector can determine the relative error of scalar charge constrained by LISA at the level of $\sim0.1$, providing a preliminary prediction of detecting scalar charge in the beyond-vacuum spacetime.

2025-12-24, **The throttling refrigeration system for the large cooling power recovery of the PandaX-xT cryogenic distillation system for radon removal**, Shunyu Yao et.al., [2512.20947v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20947v1)

 In order to solve the continuous large cooling power supply problem (20 kW) for the radon-removal cryogenic distillation system, which operates at high liquid ffow rate of 856 kg/h (5 LPM) for the dark matter detector PandaX-xT of the next-generation, a throttling refrigeration system based on carbon tetraffuoride (R14) refrigerant for cooling power recovery is designed and developed. According to this system, the cooling power of the liquid xenon in the reboiler of 178K could be transferred to the product xenon cryostat to liquefy the gaseous product xenon by the R14 circulation, thus the liqueffed xenon could return to the detector with the same condition of which extracted from the detector to form a stable cooling cycle and prevent the instability of the detector. A research and development experiment is implemented to validate the feasibility of this large cooling recovery system, using the ethanol to simulate the liquid xenon. Experimental results show that the cooling power recovery of this system could achieve 17 kW with the efffciency of 76.5%, and the R14 ffow rate is 0.16 kg/s. This study realizes the online radon removal distillation with large ffow rate while eliminating the dependence of liquid nitrogen or cryocoolers, which means saving 2414 m3 liquid nitrogen per year or the power consumption of 230 kW. Furthermore, process simulation and optimization of the throttling refrigeration cycle is studied using Aspen Hysys to reveal the inffuences of the key parameters to the system, and the deviation between the simulation and experimental results is < 2.52%.

2025-12-24, **Spectroscopy of VUV luminescence in dual-phase xenon detectors**, K. C. Oliver-Mallory et.al., [2512.20935v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20935v1)

 We present spectroscopic measurements of xenon luminescence in a time projection chamber operated in a dual-phase (liquid-gas) configuration. Thorium-228 $α$ decays excited the liquid, resulting in the formation of singlet and triplet excimers that emit vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) scintillation. Ionisation electrons were drifted to the liquid surface and extracted into the vapour, where they produced VUV electroluminescence. A time-resolved photon-counting technique was used to obtain the scintillation spectrum in the liquid, which exhibited a peak wavelength of $177.1\pm0.1\_\mathrm{stat} \pm0.1\_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$ and a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $11.3\pm0.2\_\mathrm{stat} \pm0.0\_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$. The data were also used to obtain distinct singlet and triplet emission models, with the singlet emission peaking $1.8\pm0.3\_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm 0.3\_{\mathrm{sys}}\,\textrm{nm}$ shorter than the triplet. The gas electroluminescence spectrum was obtained simultaneously, while under conditions of thermal equilibrium. It remained consistent across vapour pressures of $1.3$-$2.2\,\textrm{bar}$, with a peak of $173.28\pm0.02\_\mathrm{stat} {\_{-0.1}^{+0.2}}{}\_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$, a FWHM of $10.59\pm0.03\_\mathrm{stat} {\_{-0.2}^{+0.0}}{}\_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$, and a small short-wavelength tail that constitutes $(0.6\pm0.1)$% of the total spectrum. These are the only spectroscopic measurements of liquid scintillation and gas electroluminescence acquired simultaneously to date, and the first such measurements of singlet and triplet emission in the liquid phase. They are important for precisely characterising dual-phase xenon detectors used to search for dark matter particle interactions and other rare events.

2025-12-23, **Irreducible Constraints on Hadronically Interacting Sub-GeV Dark Matter**, Peter Cox et.al., [2512.20825v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20825v1)

 We derive conservative upper limits on the dark-matter--nucleon scattering cross-section for sub-GeV mass dark matter. Working exclusively within the low-energy chiral effective theory, we derive bounds that are independent of the details of the dark matter interactions in the UV. Dark matter that interacts only hadronically at leading order also inevitably interacts with photons or electrons at next-to-leading-order. We show that these electromagnetic interactions lead to strong constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis and over-production of dark matter via freeze-in at low temperatures, while the leading-order hadronic couplings face stringent constraints from meson decays. Combining these constraints, we rule out both spin-independent and spin-dependent dark-matter--nucleon scattering cross-sections $\gtrsim 10^{-36}\,{\rm cm}^2$ for dark matter masses in the keV - 100 MeV range. These bounds are several orders of magnitude stronger than the existing constraints from astrophysics and cosmology and have significant implications for future low-mass direct detection experiments.

2025-12-23, **Quirks Live in Cool Universes**, Pouya Asadi et.al., [2512.20696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20696v1)

 We demonstrate that cosmological observations place strong bounds on the reheat temperature $T\_\text{RH}$ of the Standard Model (SM) in minimal models of `quirks' -- heavy fermions transforming under the SM gauge group together with a new non-Abelian gauge interaction with a confinement scale far below the mass of the fermions. These models have unique collider signals associated with the confining flux strings, which cannot break due to the large mass of the quirks. Our work shows that in these models $T\_\text{RH} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV for the entire `quirky' parameter space where the effects of the flux string are important. These bounds are in tension with most models of baryogenesis, showing that the discovery of quirks at colliders can have far-reaching implications for cosmology. The bounds arise because the irreducible relic abundance of glueballs from UV freeze-in, combined with their long lifetimes, leads to constraints from the disruption of BBN, distortions of the CMB, excess $γ$-rays, an over-abundance of self-interacting dark matter, and contributions to $ΔN\_{\rm eff}$. The glueball freeze-in abundance has a strong dependence on $T\_\text{RH}$, making the bounds relatively insensitive to strong interaction uncertainties. The bounds are robust to the SM quantum numbers of the quirks and the presence of Yukawa couplings with the Higgs. In non-minimal extensions of the model where the glueballs can decay to an additional dark sector, the bounds remain for models where the flux string has a macroscopic length at colliders. We also show that for quirk masses above $\sim 10$ TeV, the dark glueballs can be the dominant component of dark matter. This work illustrates a striking connection between quirky collider signals and cosmological probes of new physics, strengthening the case for targeted quirk searches at colliders.

2025-12-23, **Dynamical Dark Energy models in light of the latest observations**, Javier de Cruz Pérez et.al., [2512.20616v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20616v1)

 In this paper, we study several models and parameterizations of dynamical dark energy (DE) that have been studied already in the past, in conjunction with the recently proposed model $w$XCDM, the running vacuum model (RVM) with and without a threshold at $z=1$ and two variants of it, the RRVM and the ``flipped RVM'', and compare them all with the concordance $Λ$CDM model and the popular $w\_0w\_a$CDM parameterization. We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H\_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w\_0w\_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced. Finally, we discuss the ability of the various models to explain the data by performing an analysis of their effective equation-of-state parameters and corresponding evolution of their dark energy densities.

2025-12-23, **Non-equilibrium Quantum Field Theory and Axion Electrodynamics in curved spacetimes**, Amedeo M. Favitta et.al., [2512.20521v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20521v1)

 Axions are hypothetical pseudoscalar particles introduced initially as a solution to the Strong CP problem in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and they also arise naturally in a broad class of low-energy compactifications of string theory. Astrophysical, cosmological, and laboratory constraints require axions to be extremely weakly coupled to Standard Model particles, making them viable dark matter candidates .This PhD thesis presents original results developed over three years of research, focusing on axion cosmology and axion electrodynamics. These topics address the production of axions and their associated topological defects in the early Universe, as well as the interactions of axions with Standard Model particles. The analysis combines methods from non-equilibrium quantum field theory and quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. After reviewing the foundations of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and cosmology, the thesis introduces the Strong CP problem and the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, including the PQWW axion model and its invisible extensions. Ultraviolet completions of QCD axion theories are discussed in both field-theoretic and extra-dimensional frameworks. A significant part of the thesis is devoted to axion electrodynamics, where a classical axion background modifies Maxwell's equations and electromagnetic observables. The non-equilibrium dynamics of self-interacting axion fields coupled to the Standard Model or to a dark sector are also studied using the two-particle-irreducible effective action, and applied to pre- and post-inflationary cosmological scenarios, yielding new insights and preliminary constraints.

2025-12-23, **Cosmological consequences of spontaneous symmetry breaking**, Giacomo Ferrante et.al., [2512.20474v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20474v1)

 The Standard Model of particle physics and the $Λ$CDM model of cosmology provide an incomplete description of our Universe. Both models face challenges, including explaining the nature of dark matter, the origin of the Universe's initial conditions, and the fine-tuning of the Higgs boson mass. This thesis investigates the cosmological implications of spontaneous symmetry breaking to address some of these issues, focusing on theories with a non-trivial vacuum structure. We introduce a novel class of elementary scalars called ''accidents'', which emerge as accidentally flat directions in the vacuum manifold: unlike Nambu-Goldstone boson directions, accident directions are not related to any symmetry. Radiative corrections induce a mass for the accidents that is one-loop suppressed with respect to naive expectations, making them naturally light. We propose that accidents can act as viable dark matter candidates, and as the inflaton driving cosmic inflation. We construct a model of hybrid inflation in which the inflaton potential is an accident direction and is naturally flat. In models of accident inflation where the vacuum manifold has a non-trivial topology, cosmic strings and domain walls form after the end of inflation. Such topological defects generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Finally, we investigate the cosmological production of dark magnetic monopoles. Focusing on 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles from SO(3)$\rightarrow$SO(2) symmetry breaking, we explore both second-order and first-order phase transitions, and we identify the regions of parameter space where the monopole relic density matches the one of dark matter. This model also features stable massive gauge bosons. We find that the relic density of dark gauge bosons is always far larger than the one of monopoles, concluding that dark monopoles cannot constitute a sizeable fraction of dark matter.

2025-12-23, **Leading order effective operators in quantum gravity**, Tommaso Antonelli et.al., [2512.20375v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20375v1)

 We explore the nature of higher dimensional operators generated by quantum gravity. Calculating the tree-level and one-loop effective operators generated by graviton exchange between fields of the standard model and those of a hidden sector, we show that the leading order operators generated by quantum gravity are non-local dimension 6 operators. Dimension 5 operators are not generated by perturbative (weak field) effects, although they might be generated by strong field effects such as Planck-scale fluctuations in spacetime. We investigate the consequences of our findings for models of ultralight scalar dark matter.

2025-12-23, **On Finite Temperature Quantum Field Theory: From Theoretical Foundations To Electroweak Phase Transition**, Mohamed Aboudonia et.al., [2512.20327v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20327v1)

 In the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang, the universe existed in an extremely hot, dense state in which particle interactions occurred not in a vacuum but within a thermal medium. Under such conditions, the standard framework of quantum field theory (QFT) requires a finite temperature extension, wherein propagators -- and hence the fundamental structure of the theory -- are modified to reflect thermal background effects. These thermal modifications are central to understanding the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) as a high temperature phase transition, potentially leading to qualitatively different vacuum structures for the Higgs field as the universe cooled. Finite temperature corrections naturally regulate ultraviolet divergences in propagators, hinting at a possible route toward ultraviolet completion. However, these same thermal effects exacerbate infrared pathologies and can lead to imaginary contributions to the effective potential, particularly when analysing metastable or multi-vacuum configurations. Additional theoretical challenges, such as gauge dependence and renormalization scale ambiguity, further obscure the precise characterization of the electroweak phase transition even in minimal extensions of the Standard Model (SM). This review presents the theoretical foundations of finite temperature QFT with an emphasis on how different field species respond to thermal effects, identifying the bosonic sector as the primary source of key theoretical subtleties. We focus particularly on the scalar extension of the SM, which offers a compelling framework for realizing first order electroweak phase transitions, electroweak baryogenesis, and accommodating dark matter candidates depending on the underlying $Z\_2$ symmetry structure.

2025-12-23, **Exact Solution of Schrödinger equation for Complex Mass Quantum System under Complex Morse Potential to study emergent matter types and its phases**, Partha Sarathi et.al., [2512.20318v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20318v1)

 We present exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation for a quantum system with complex mass subjected to a complex Morse potential in the extended complex phase space. The normalized eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenspectra are derived within a non-Hermitian framework, ensuring consistent probability densities. Conditions for the reality of the spectra are established and used to analyze the dependence of eigenvalue behaviour on potential parameters. The study reveals distinct regimes of spectral characteristics arising from the interplay of complex mass, the Morse parameter, and eigenvalues, leading to the emergence of five intrinsic matter types. By analysing the energy eigenspectra, normalization conditions, and probability density profiles across parameter space, we identify regimes corresponding to real-spectrum Hermitian-like matter, quasi-stable or resonant states, purely complex quantum matter, non-physical, non-normalizable states, and a quasi-classical determinate regime in which the probability density becomes spatially static. One of these system exhibits a non-dissipative, collisionless state with long-range gravitational-like characteristics, suggesting a theoretical analogue for dark matter within a non-Hermitian quantum framework. Further, the five identified classes of matter may be interpreted as distinct phases of a single quantum system governed by complex mass and Morse parameters This classification elucidates the boundary between physical and non-physical regimes in complex quantum systems and provides a unified approach for interpreting stability, resonance, and emergent classicality arising from complex parameters.

2025-12-23, **Novel Light Dark Matter Detection with Quantum Parity Detector Using Qubit Arrays**, Xuegang Li et.al., [2512.20309v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20309v1)

 We present the design and the sensitivity reach of the Qubit-based Light Dark Matter detection experiment. We propose the novel two-chip design to reduce signal dissipation, with quantum parity measurement to enhance single-phonon detection sensitivity. We demonstrate the performance of the detector with full phonon and quasiparticle simulations. The experiment is projected to detect $\gtrsim 30$ meV energy deposition with nearly $100\%$ efficiency and high energy resolution. The sensitivity to $m\_χ\gtrsim 0.01$ MeV dark matter scattering cross section is expected to be advanced by orders of magnitude for both light and heavy mediators, and similar improvements will be achieved for axion and dark photon absorption in the $0.04$-$0.2$ eV mass range.

2025-12-23, **A non-compact QCD axion**, Georgios K. Karananas et.al., [2512.20290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20290v1)

 We investigate the cosmology of an axion that is fundamentally non-compact. During inflation, fluctuations of the effectively massless field populate many QCD vacua, thereby evading conventional isocurvature constraints while generating domain walls -- without accompanying cosmic strings. A small non-QCD contribution to the axion potential is required to trigger the timely collapse of domain walls; as a consequence, a residual amount of CP violation in the strong sector must exist, potentially within reach of planned experiments. Non-compact axions can account for the entirety of the dark matter abundance, and the collapse of domain walls sources a stochastic gravitational-wave background at nanohertz frequencies. Such axion dynamics can be embedded in top-down constructions -- such as Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity -- where the tilting of the axion potential arises automatically.

2025-12-23, **Decay of $f(R)$ quintessence into dark matter: mitigating the Hubble tension?**, Giovanni Montani et.al., [2512.20193v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20193v1)

 We propose a revised cosmological scenario that extends the $Λ$ Cold Dark Matter ($Λ$CDM) framework by incorporating metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame. In this model, the dark energy component arises from a non-minimally coupled scalar field, decomposed into a smooth background (set to unity to recover General Relativity) and a rapidly varying, massive fluctuation that decays into the dark matter sector. In the near-GR limit, this setup provides a phenomenological extension of $Λ$CDM characterized by two additional parameters: the present-day value of the scalar fluctuation and a normalized decay rate. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of low-redshift cosmological data, comprising Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometer measurements, we find that the proposed model achieves a better overall fit than $Λ$CDM, while the Bayesian evidence remains statistically inconclusive given the inclusion of two extra parameters. The model predicts a moderate increase in the inferred value of $H\_0$ and an improved consistency with DESI BAO data when adopting the SH0ES prior. Furthermore, describing dark matter particle creation as a transition phase in the late Universe offers an intriguing physical interpretation, potentially capturing features already present in current data and providing a promising avenue to explore extensions of the standard cosmological model within modified gravity frameworks.

 The resolution of photon rings of Sgr~A$^*$ and M87 is the next milestone of upcoming EHT-like interferometries. We extend the formalism developed in our previous work~\cite{Verma:2023hes} to constrain primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter using microlensing-induced distortions of black hole shadows. Building upon the theoretical framework for microlensing of photon rings, we apply this methodology to both Sgr A* and M87, considering multiple PBH populations: (i) PBH dark matter spikes around central supermassive black holes, (ii) NFW halo contributions in the Milky Way and M87 galaxies, and (iii) foreground Milky Way PBH dark matter affecting M87* observations. The microlensing signal manifests as a time-dependent asymmetry and deformation of the photon ring, providing the most sensitive observable for lensing effects. We assess the detectability of these signatures with future EHT-like interferometers. Our analysis reveals that M87* provides the strongest constraints on PBH dark matter. We show that the absence of photon-ring asymmetries in observations with angular resolution of order $0.1\,μ{\rm as}$ can constrain PBHs in the mass range $10^{-5}\,M\_\odot \lesssim M\_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{6}\,M\_\odot$, with maximal sensitivity near $M\_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{3}\,M\_\odot$, for PBH dark matter fractions as small as $f\_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-2}$.

 The Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 2 (ZTF DR2) includes a total of 3,628 Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), providing the largest and most complete sample of spectroscopically confirmed SNe~Ia at low redshift to date. In this paper, we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 124 subluminous SNe~Ia, the largest sample of spectroscopically classified subluminous SNe~Ia observed with a single instrument, comprising 87 91bg-like, 12 86G-like, 18 04gs-like, and 7 02es-like events. We complement the published DR2 SALT2 light-curve parameters with new parameters obtained using template-based fits from SNooPy. Expansion velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths pEW of key spectral features are measured using Spextractor, and spectral averages are constructed for each subluminous subtype, binned by phase. We also analyze the host galaxy environments, both global and local, in terms of $g - z$ color, stellar mass, and directional light radius $d\_{DLR}$. We find that all subluminous SNe~Ia (except the 02es-like subtype) are intrinsically red. This is evident by separating extrinsic from intrinsic color components. Since SALT2 is not trained on subluminous SNe~Ia, it compensates for their redder colors by inflating the $c$ parameter, thus extending the luminosity-width relation to negative values of x1. As expected, all subluminous SNe~Ia fall within the Cool region of the Branch et al. (2006) diagram, with the exception of 02es-like events, which show lower Si II 5972 pEW values. All subluminous subtypes tend to occur in more massive, redder host galaxies, and in the reddest local environments. Notably, 91bg- and 86G-like SNe~Ia explode at significantly larger normalized galactocentric distances. Finally, we identify the $pEW$ of the blended Ti II+Si II+Mg II absorption feature at 4300~A, along with s\_BV, as robust and sufficient indicators for subclassifying subluminous SNe~Ia.

 The pair-instability supernova (PISN) mechanism predicts a mass gap in the black hole population, where no stellar-origin black holes are expected to form. However, the binary black hole merger events GW190521 and GW231123 appear unusual, as current analyses place their component masses within the PISN mass gap. In this work, we investigate the relationship between different lensing magnifications and the inferred source-frame black hole masses for these two events. If the gravitational wave source is lensed, neglecting lensing effect can bias the inferred luminosity distance and hence the redshift, leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance and consequently an overestimation of the source-frame masses, potentially placing them in the mass-gap region. For the two events in mass gap, when adopting a lower bound of $60 M\_{\odot}$ for the mass gap, the minimum magnifications required to shift the inferred source-frame masses below this gap boundary are found to be $μ=12.2$ for GW190521 and $μ=320.1$ for GW231123, corresponding to lensing-corrected luminosity distances of $11155\, \mathrm{Mpc}$ and $15207\, \mathrm{Mpc}$, respectively. These results provide a quantitative reference for assessing the lensing hypothesis as a possible explanation for the existence of black holes in the PISN mass gap.

2025-12-23, **Revisiting the Mass Step: Environmental Dependence of Type Ia Supernovae in Low-Metallicity Host Galaxies**, Estefania Padilla Gonzalez et.al., [2512.20834v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20834v1)

 Despite the tremendous impact of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on the field of cosmology, their underlying physics are still poorly understood. Studies have found an intriguing correlation between standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities and host galaxy masses, commonly referred to as the "mass step". SNe Ia in massive galaxies appear systematically brighter than in lower-mass, star-forming hosts after standardization. However, previous analyses use host galaxy mass estimates derived largely from optical data alone and assume parametric forms for host star formation histories (SFHs), both of which are known to misestimate galaxy stellar masses. In this work, we re-examine the mass-step relation with a sample of SN Ia host galaxies complete in broadband optical (3000 Angstrom to 1 micron) and near-infrared (up to 1.8 micron) data, and in some cases including mid-infrared observations (up to 4.5 micron), using Prospector to derive nonparametric SFHs. We find that while the masses for these galaxies have indeed been underestimated, the overall trend in SN Ia luminosity versus host mass remains largely unchanged. We also uncover an environmental metallicity-dependent trend, in which low-metallicity galaxies (Z < -1 Zsol) may drive much of the observed SN Ia luminosity-mass correlation, suggesting that the chemical composition of the SN environment plays a central role in shaping the standardized brightness of SNe Ia.

 We perform a Bayesian comparison between thawing quintessence and a cosmological constant, incorporating theoretically motivated priors on the phenomenological Padé-w parameters used to model thawing dynamics. We find that thawing quintessence is consistently preferred over a cosmological constant when combining BAO data from DESI DR2 and CMB data from Planck+ACT with any of the major supernova compilations, including the recently updated DES-Dovekie sample. This preference is not sensitive to our choice of prior, but it is contingent on the inclusion of supernovae in the analysis. We comment on the consistency between various information criteria and Bayesian evidence ratios, finding that the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) tracks the Bayesian evidence more reliably than either the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Finally, we use observational likelihoods to identify which thawing trajectories are compatible with the available data, independently of theoretical priors.

 In this paper, we study several models and parameterizations of dynamical dark energy (DE) that have been studied already in the past, in conjunction with the recently proposed model $w$XCDM, the running vacuum model (RVM) with and without a threshold at $z=1$ and two variants of it, the RRVM and the ``flipped RVM'', and compare them all with the concordance $Λ$CDM model and the popular $w\_0w\_a$CDM parameterization. We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H\_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w\_0w\_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced. Finally, we discuss the ability of the various models to explain the data by performing an analysis of their effective equation-of-state parameters and corresponding evolution of their dark energy densities.

2025-12-23, **From Cosmology to Cosmonomy**, Emmanuel N. Saridakis et.al., [2512.20416v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20416v1)

 For most of its history, cosmology was a qualitatively constrained discourse on the universe, shaped by limited observational access and the absence of global dynamical laws. This situation has changed decisively in recent decades. Modern cosmology is now driven by an unprecedented flow of high-precision data from a wide range of independent probes, including the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing, cosmic chronometers, redshift-space distortions, gravitational-wave standard sirens, and emerging 21-cm observations, among others. This observational wealth is matched by a concrete theoretical and mathematical framework, based on general relativity, which provides the dynamical equations governing the evolution of spacetime and matter at cosmic scales. Combined with explicit background and perturbative equations, this framework enables quantitative, predictive, and falsifiable descriptions of cosmic evolution. Thus, cosmology operates today as a nomological natural science of the observable universe, characterized by general laws, predictive power, and systematic empirical testing. We argue that this epistemic transformation motivates a corresponding conceptual shift, directly analogous to the historical transition from astrology to astronomy. In this sense, the transition from cosmology to \emph{cosmonomy} should begin to be discussed among cosmologists, or, more precisely, among cosmonomers.

2025-12-23, **A Spectrum of Cosmological Rips and Their Observational Signatures**, Mikel Artola et.al., [2512.20383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20383v1)

 We present a unified dark energy framework capable of generating a continuous spectrum of cosmological ``rip'' scenarios -- including the Big Rip, Grand Rip, Mild Rip, Little Rip, Little Sibling of the Big Rip, and the newly found Dollhouse Rip -- while ensuring a physically consistent evolution across cosmic history. Building on earlier phenomenological proposals, we introduce a barotropic equation-of-state parameter with a sigmoid-like correction to guarantee a strictly positive dark energy density and to avoid early-time pathologies commonly present in previous models. Using this formulation, closed-form analytic expressions for the energy density can be obtained. This, in turn, enables a systematic classification of future singularities based on the signs and magnitudes of two key parameters of the model. We test these scenarios with state-of-the-art cosmological probes, including DESI DR2 BAO, cosmic chronometers, CMB compressed likelihoods, and the Pantheon+ supernovae sample. According to our Bayesian analysis, all rip scenarios yield best-fit parameters compatible with $Λ$CDM at the $1σ$ level, with Bayes factors weakly favoring $Λ$CDM. The mild, logarithmic evolution of the proposed dark energy density prevents current observations from distinguishing among the different future fates. We conclude that, for rip cosmologies to gain observational support over $Λ$CDM, they must display more accentuated late-time dynamical features -- such as perhaps rapid transitions or a phantom-divide crossing -- within the redshift range probed by present surveys.

2025-12-23, **Decay of $f(R)$ quintessence into dark matter: mitigating the Hubble tension?**, Giovanni Montani et.al., [2512.20193v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20193v1)

 We propose a revised cosmological scenario that extends the $Λ$ Cold Dark Matter ($Λ$CDM) framework by incorporating metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame. In this model, the dark energy component arises from a non-minimally coupled scalar field, decomposed into a smooth background (set to unity to recover General Relativity) and a rapidly varying, massive fluctuation that decays into the dark matter sector. In the near-GR limit, this setup provides a phenomenological extension of $Λ$CDM characterized by two additional parameters: the present-day value of the scalar fluctuation and a normalized decay rate. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of low-redshift cosmological data, comprising Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometer measurements, we find that the proposed model achieves a better overall fit than $Λ$CDM, while the Bayesian evidence remains statistically inconclusive given the inclusion of two extra parameters. The model predicts a moderate increase in the inferred value of $H\_0$ and an improved consistency with DESI BAO data when adopting the SH0ES prior. Furthermore, describing dark matter particle creation as a transition phase in the late Universe offers an intriguing physical interpretation, potentially capturing features already present in current data and providing a promising avenue to explore extensions of the standard cosmological model within modified gravity frameworks.
