2023-04-20, **Self-consistent calculations for atomic electron capture**, V. A. Sevestrean et.al., [2304.10373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10373v1)

 This paper presents a comprehensive study of electron capture (EC) ratios across a wide range of nuclei using a self-consistent computational method. We have incorporated important effects such as overlap and exchange corrections, shake-up and shake-off effects in the EC formalism. The electronic wave functions were computed in the Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater (DHFS) framework, accounting for electron screening and correlations in the atomic structure description. The DHFS framework was chosen based on the systematic comparison of binding energies and Coulomb amplitudes with previous theoretical models and experimental data. The main feature of this paper is the refined determination of the emitted neutrino energy, which requires extensive atomic structure calculations but leads to much better agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental values, especially for low-energy transitions. Detailed results are presented for nuclei of practical interest ($^{67}\mathrm{Ga}$, $^{111}\mathrm{In}$, $^{123}\mathrm{I}$, $^{125}\mathrm{I}$ and $^{125}\mathrm{Xe}$) in nuclear medicine and exotic physics searches involving liquid Xenon detectors. This study provides a robust and comprehensive understanding of EC ratios, with significant implications for astrophysical, nuclear, and medical applications.

2023-04-20, **Particles and antiparticles**, Dezső Horváth et.al., [2304.10231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10231v1)

 We review the concept of chirality and charge for particles and antiparticles. We point out that the commonly accepted equivalence of particles and antiparticles - with difference only in the opposite signs of their charges, which follows from the CPT invariance - is valid only for free non-chiral particles. We show that with the weak interaction turned on the equivalence of particles and antiparticles is violated. We also discuss that within the Standard Model even free neutrinos are exceptions, they can be produced only in chiral states. We conclude that in spite of a long history of antiparticles, interesting theoretical and experimental challenges remain in their complete understanding.

2023-04-20, **Dai-Freed anomaly in the standard model and topological inflation**, Masahiro Kawasaki et.al., [2304.10100v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10100v1)

 When we impose the discrete symmetry in the standard model we have Dai-Freed global anomalies. However, interestingly if we introduce three right-handed neutrinos we can have an anomaly-free discrete $Z\_4$ gauge symmetry. This $Z\_4$ symmetry should be spontaneously broken down to the $Z\_2$ symmetry to generate the heavy Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos. We show that this symmetry breaking naturally generates topological inflation, which is consistent with the CMB observations at present and predicts a significant tensor mode with scalar-tensor ratio $r > 0.03$. The right-handed neutrinos play an important role in reheating processes. The reheating temperature is as high as $\sim 10^8$GeV, and non-thermal leptogenesis successfully takes place.

2023-04-20, **A Mixture of LBG Overdensities in the Fields of Three $6 < z < 7$ Quasars: Implications for the Robustness of Photometric Selection**, Jaclyn B. Champagne et.al., [2304.10437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10437v1)

 The most luminous quasars at $z > 6$ are suspected to be both highly clustered and reside in the most massive dark matter halos in the early Universe, making them prime targets to search for galaxy overdensities and/or protoclusters. We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 < z < 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY. One field, J0305-3150, shows a volume density 10$\times$ higher than the blank-field UV luminosity function (UVLF) at M$\_{UV} < -20$, with tentative evidence of a 3$\sigma$ overdensity in its parallel field located 15 cMpc away. Another field, J2054-0005, shows an angular overdensity within 500 ckpc from the quasar but still consistent with UVLF predictions within 3$\sigma$, while the last field, J2348-3054, shows no enhancement. We discuss methods for reducing uncertainty in overdensity measurements when using photometric selection and show that we can robustly select LBGs consistent with being physically associated with the quasar, corroborated by existing JWST/NIRCam WFSS data in the J0305 field. Even accounting for incompleteness, the overdensities in J0305 and J2054 are higher for brighter galaxies at short angular separations, suggesting preferential enhancement of more massive galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the quasar. Finally, we compare the LBG population with previously-identified [CII] and mm-continuum companions; the LBG overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-redshift protoclusters.

2023-04-20, **Anisotropic Satellite Galaxy Quenching: A Unique Signature of Energetic Feedback by Supermassive Black Holes?**, Juliana S. M. Karp et.al., [2304.10403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10403v1)

 The quenched fraction of satellite galaxies is aligned with the orientation of the halo's central galaxy, such that on average, satellites form stars at a lower rate along the major axis of the central. This effect, called anisotropic satellite galaxy quenching (ASGQ), has been found in observational data and cosmological simulations. Analyzing the IllustrisTNG simulation, Mart\'in-Navarro et al. (2021) recently argued that ASGQ is caused by anisotropic energetic feedback and constitutes "compelling observational evidence for the role of black holes in regulating galaxy evolution." In this letter, we study the causes of ASGQ in state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations to evaluate this claim. We show that cosmological simulations predict that on average, satellite galaxies along the major axis of the dark matter halo tend to have been accreted at earlier cosmic times and are hosted by subhalos of larger peak halo masses. As a result, a modulation of the quenched fraction with respect to the major axis of the central galaxy is a natural prediction of hierarchical structure formation. We show that ASGQ is predicted by the UniverseMachine galaxy formation model, a model without anisotropic feedback. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even in the IllustrisTNG simulation, anisotropic satellite accretion properties are the main cause of ASGQ. Ultimately, we argue that ASGQ is not a reliable indicator of supermassive black hole feedback in galaxy formation simulations and, thus, should not be interpreted as such in observational data.

2023-04-20, **No evidence for p- or d-wave dark matter annihilation from local large-scale structure**, Andrija Kostić et.al., [2304.10301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10301v1)

 If dark matter annihilates into standard model particles with a cross-section which is velocity dependent, then Local Group dwarf galaxies will not be the best place to search for the resulting gamma ray emission. A greater flux would be produced by more distant and massive halos, with larger velocity dispersions. We construct full-sky predictions for the gamma-ray emission from galaxy- and cluster-mass halos within $\sim 200 \, {\mathrm{Mpc}}$ using a suite of constrained $N$-body simulations (CSiBORG) based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies algorithm. Comparing to observations from the Fermi Large Area Telescope and marginalising over reconstruction uncertainties and other astrophysical contributions to the flux, we obtain constraints on the cross-section which are two (seven) orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from dwarf spheroidals for $p$-wave ($d$-wave) annihilation. We find no evidence for either type of annihilation from dark matter particles with masses in the range $m\_\chi = 2-500 \, {\mathrm{GeV}}/c^2$, for any channel. As an example, for annihilations producing bottom quarks with $m\_\chi = 10 \, {\mathrm{GeV}}/c^2$, we find $a\_{1} < 2.4 \times 10^{-21} \, {\mathrm{cm^3 s^{-1}}}$ and $a\_{2} < 3.0 \times 10^{-18} \, {\mathrm{cm^3 s^{-1}}}$ at 95% confidence, where the product of the cross-section, $\sigma$, and relative particle velocity, $v$, is given by $\sigma v = a\_\ell (v/c)^{2\ell}$ and $\ell=1, 2$ for $p$-, $d$-wave annihilation, respectively. Our bounds, although failing to exclude the thermal relic cross-section for velocity-dependent annihilation channels, are among the tightest to date.

2023-04-20, **Solitons and halos for self-interacting scalar dark matter**, Raquel Galazo García et.al., [2304.10221v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10221v1)

 We study the formation and evolution of solitons supported by repulsive self-interactions inside extended halos, for scalar-field dark matter scenarios. We focus on the semiclassical regime where the quantum pressure is typically much smaller than the self-interactions. We present numerical simulations, with initial conditions where the halo is described by the WKB approximation for its eigenfunction coefficients. We find that when the size of the system is of the order of the Jeans length associated with the self-interactions, a central soliton quickly forms and makes about 50% of the total mass. However, if the halo is ten times greater than this self-interaction scale, a soliton only quickly forms in cuspy halos where the central density is large enough to trigger the self-interactions. If the halo has a flat core, it takes a longer time for a soliton to appear, after small random fluctuations on the de Broglie wavelength size build up to reach a large enough density. In some cases, we observe the co-existence of several narrow density spikes inside the larger self-interaction-supported soliton. All solitons appear robust and slowly grow, unless they already make up 40% of the total mass. We develop a kinetic theory, valid for an inhomogeneous background, to estimate the soliton growth rate for low masses. It explains the fast falloff of the growth rate as resonances between the ground state and halo excited states disappear. Our results suggest that cosmological halos would show a large scatter for their soliton mass, depending on their assembly history.

2023-04-20, **Examining the Self-Interaction of Dark Matter through Central Cluster Galaxy Offsets**, Dane Cross et.al., [2304.10128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10128v1)

 While collisionless cold dark matter models have been largely successful in explaining a wide range of observational data, some tensions still exist, and it remains possible that dark matter possesses a non-negligible level of self interactions. In this paper, we investigate a possible observable consequence of self-interacting dark matter: offsets between the central galaxy and the center of mass of its parent halo. We examine 23 relaxed galaxy clusters in a redshift range of 0.1 to 0.3 drawn from clusters in the Dark Energy Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which have archival Chandra X-ray data of sufficient depth for center and relaxation determination. We find that most clusters in our sample show non-zero offsets between the X-ray center, taken to be the centroid within the cluster core, and the central galaxy position. All of the measured offsets are larger, typically by an order of magnitude, than the uncertainty in the X-ray position due to Poisson noise. In all but six clusters, the measured offsets are also larger than the estimated, combined astrometric uncertainties in the X-ray and optical positions. A more conservative cut on concentration to select relaxed clusters marginally reduces but does not eliminate the observed offset. With our more conservative sample, we find an estimated mean X-ray to central galaxy offset of $\mu = 5.5 \pm 1.0$ kpc. Comparing to recent simulations, this distribution of offsets is consistent with some level of dark matter self interaction, though further simulation work is needed to place constraints.

2023-04-20, **Analyzing cancellation mechanism of the DM-quark scattering in a complex singlet extension of the Standard Model**, Gi-Chol Cho et.al., [2304.10096v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10096v1)

 We investigate a suppression mechanism of dark matter and quark scattering amplitudes in a complex singlet extension of the Standard Model. It has been pointed out that, in a some variant of the model, the scattering amplitudes cancel each other in the limit in which two mediator scalars degenerate in their masses. We study the origin of such the cancellation mechanism and show that the operators describing the Higgs-singlet scalar mixing play essential role. We derive sum rules for couplings in the general scalar potential of the model, which guarantee the cancellation of the scattering amplitudes in the tree and the 1-loop level.

2023-04-20, **A Superluminous Supernova Lightened by Collisions with Pulsational Pair-instability Shells**, Weili Lin et.al., [2304.10416v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10416v1)

 Superluminous supernovae are among the most energetic stellar explosions in the Universe, but their energy sources remain an open question. Here we present long-term observations of one of the closest examples of the hydrogen-poor subclass (SLSNe-I), SN~2017egm, revealing the most complicated known luminosity evolution of SLSNe-I. Three distinct post-peak bumps were recorded in its light curve collected at about $100$--350\,days after maximum brightness, challenging current popular power models such as magnetar, fallback accretion, and interaction between ejecta and a circumstellar shell. However, the complex light curve can be well modelled by successive interactions with multiple circumstellar shells with a total mass of about $6.8$--7.7\,M$\_\odot$. In this scenario, large energy deposition from interaction-induced reverse shocks results in ionization of neutral oxygen in the supernova ejecta and hence a much lower nebular-phase line ratio of [O\,\textsc{i}] $\lambda6300$/([Ca\,\textsc{ii}] + [O\,\textsc{ii}]) $\lambda7300$ ($\sim 0.2$) compared with that derived for other superluminous and normal stripped-envelope SNe. The pre-existing multiple shells indicate that the progenitor of SN~2017egm experienced pulsational mass ejections triggered by pair instability within 2 years before explosion, in robust agreement with theoretical predictions for a pre-pulsation helium-core mass of 48--51\,M$\_{\odot}$.

2023-04-20, **Bayesian evidence and model selection approach for time-dependent dark energy**, Mohsen Khorasani et.al., [2304.10160v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10160v1)

 We use parameterized post-Friedmann (PPF) description for dark energy and apply ellipsoidal nested sampling to perform the Bayesian model selection method on different time-dependent dark energy models using a combination of $Planck$ and data based on distance measurements, namely baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae luminosity distance. Models with two and three free parameters described in terms of linear scale factor $a$, or scaled in units of e-folding $\ln a$ are considered. Our results show that parameterizing dark energy in terms of $\ln a$ provides better constraints on the free parameters than polynomial expressions. In general, two free-parameter models are adequate to describe the dynamics of the dark energy compared to their three free-parameter generalizations. According to the Bayesian evidence, determining the strength of support for cosmological constant $\Lambda$ over polynomial dark energy models remains inconclusive. Furthermore, considering the $R$ statistic as the tension metric shows that one of the polynomial models gives rise to a tension between $Planck$ and distance measurements data sets. The preference for the logarithmic equation of state over $\Lambda$ is inconclusive, and the strength of support for $\rm \Lambda$CDM over the oscillating model is moderate.

2023-04-20, **Early-time spectroscopic modelling of the transitional Type Ia Supernova 2021rhu with TARDIS**, Luke Harvey et.al., [2304.10129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10129v1)

 An open question in SN Ia research is where the boundary lies between 'normal' Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) that are used in cosmological measurements and those that sit off the Phillips relation. We present the spectroscopic modelling of one such '86G-like' transitional SN Ia, SN 2021rhu, that has recently been employed as a local Hubble Constant calibrator using a tip of the red-giant branch measurement. We detail its modelling from -12 d until maximum brightness using the radiative-transfer spectral-synthesis code tardis. We base our modelling on literature delayed-detonation and deflagration models of Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, as well as the double-detonation models of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. We present a new method for 'projecting' abundance profiles to different density profiles for ease of computation. Due to the small velocity extent and low outer densities of the W7 profile, we find it inadequate to reproduce the evolution of SN 2021rhu as it fails to match the high-velocity calcium components. The host extinction of SN 2021rhu is uncertain but we use modelling with and without an extinction correction to set lower and upper limits on the abundances of individual species. Comparing these limits to literature models we conclude that the spectral evolution of SN 2021rhu is also incompatible with double-detonation scenarios, lying more in line with those resulting from the delayed detonation mechanism (although there are some discrepancies, in particular a larger titanium abundance in SN 2021rhu compared to the literature). This suggests that SN 2021rhu is likely a lower luminosity, and hence lower temperature, version of a normal SN Ia.
