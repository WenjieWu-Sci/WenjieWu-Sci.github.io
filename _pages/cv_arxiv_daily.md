2025-05-20, **Neutrinophilic Super-Resonant Dark Matter**, Murat Abdughani et.al., [2505.14491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14491v1)

 Dark matter (DM) annihilation can be significantly enhanced through narrow resonances or the Sommerfeld enhancement effect, with both mechanisms potentially combining in a super-resonant annihilation process. In such scenarios, the conventional assumption that kinetic equilibrium persists until chemical decoupling may not hold, leading to substantial impacts on the final DM relic density. However, a strongly enhanced annihilation cross-section into Standard Model particles, except neutrinos, is constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We thus investigate DM annihilation into neutrino pair final states, focusing on the role of kinetic decoupling. We solve the coupled Boltzmann equations to determine the relic density and constrain the parameter space using current experimental data, while also forecasting the sensitivity of future experiments.

2025-05-20, **Constraints on Neutrino Secret Interactions from Multi-messenger Neutrinos Scattering on C$ν$B**, Maria Petropavlova et.al., [2505.14332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14332v1)

 We present new constraints on neutrino secret interactions ($\nu$SI) by studying high-energy neutrinos from well-known astrophysical sources, such as SN1987A, the blazars TXS $0506+056$ and PKS $0735+178$, the active galaxy NGC 1068, and KM3-230213A neutrino event. We extend existing limits by covering a previously unconstrained region of the mediator mass parameter space. Our analysis focuses on Dirac neutrinos interacting with a massive spin-one boson as they propagate through the Cosmic Neutrino Background. We consider both ultra-relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, deriving bounds on the $\nu$SI coupling constant across the full $\nu$SI mediator mass range. Our results obtained using analytical methods, demonstrate significant constraints on the $\nu$SI coupling in the low-mass mediator mass region for a given cutoff parameter.

2025-05-20, **Cosmic Ray Muon Polarization to Facilitate Atmospheric Neutrino Physics**, Ming-Chen Sun et.al., [2505.13877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13877v1)

 Atmospheric neutrinos (ATNs) offer a paradigm to understand neutrino properties while it is critical to quantify uncertainties in the flux modelings. Measurement of cosmic ray muons will contribute to the precision measurement of atmospheric neutrino oscillations due to the same parent particles. This letter suggests measuring the polarization of cosmic ray muons with an array strategy good for understanding low-energy cosmic ray muons and atmospheric neutrinos. Constraints on long-standing atmospheric neutrino flux uncertainties in the few-GeV range are achievable within one year using a $\mathcal{O}(10) \mathrm{m}^2$ array of Cosmic-Ray muon Spin polarization detectoRs (CRmuSRs).

2025-05-20, **The dynamics of the parsec-scale jet in the neutrino blazar PKS 0735+178**, Yu-Sik Kim et.al., [2505.13876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13876v1)

 Recent studies of individual track-like TeV-PeV IceCube neutrino events suggest that strongly jetted AGNs, blazars, can be plausible sources of extragalactic high-energy neutrinos. Although the broadband emission and neutrinos from such blazars can be modeled by hadronic jets with inverse Compton processes, various models show degeneracies. One of the reasons is the lack of high-resolution observations pinpointing the location and physical conditions of neutrino-emitting plasma. Here, we present a VLBI study of PKS 0735+178 that was recently associated with a high energy neutrino event IceCube-211208A (IC211208) as well as alerts from other neutrino observatories. We analyzed publicly available VLBA 15 and 43 GHz data of 0735+178 during 2020-2024, resolving the mas-scale jet and tracing its time evolution in flux and structure, before and after IC211208. We find significant enhancements in the radio flux density, apparent brightness temperature, and synchrotron opacity at 15-43 GHz of the VLBI nuclear region after IC211208, strengthening the temporal correlation between 0735+178 and IC211208. Furthermore, we find that the source ejected a new VLBI component C2 from the VLBI core before IC211208. C2 traveled further downstream at ~4.2c apparent speed, close to the historical maximum speed for this object. C2 then passed a subluminally moving feature in the jet C1 located at ~0.13 mas (~0.77 pc) downstream the core at the time of IC211208. The time of this apparent passage is statistically coincident with the time of IC211208 within 1sigma uncertainty, suggesting the location of this apparent passage to be a probable spatial origin of IC211208. We discuss the physical implications of these findings.

2025-05-19, **Probing the 3+1 neutrino model in the SHiP experiment**, Ki-Young Choi et.al., [2505.12785v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12785v1)

 In this study, as an extension of our previous work, we estimate the sensitivity of the Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) experiment to the 3+1 model using the charged-current deep inelastic scattering event spectrum. We employ the Feldman-Cousins method with a parametric bootstrap to account for nuisance parameters and systematic uncertainties. In the previous study, we proposed a dual baseline approach by suggesting Far SND (FSND) at 120 m with Near SND (NSND) at 27 m. We employ the same approach in this study. The NSND-only configuration can probe mixing parameters of $\|U\_{\alpha4}\|^2 \gtrsim 0.1$ near $\Delta m\_{41}^2 \sim 10^3\,\mathrm{eV}^2$, with a reduction of normalized systematic uncertainties from 20\% to 10\% improving sensitivity by roughly a factor of two. Moreover, the inclusion of FSND significantly enhances the sensitivity by a factor of 2 to 10 depending on the flavor and the systematic uncertainty. In two-flavor mixing scenarios, a cancellation between neutrino appearance and disappearance generates kinks in the sensitivity curves, that are vanished in the dual-baseline approach.

2025-05-19, **Cluster optical depth and pairwise velocity estimation using machine learning**, Yulin Gong et.al., [2505.12720v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12720v1)

 We apply two machine learning methods, a CNN deep-leaning model and a gradient-boosting decision tree, to estimate individual cluster optical depths from observed properties derived from multiple complementary datasets. The models are trained and tested with simulated N-body derived halo catalogs and synthetic full-sky CMB maps designed to mirror data from the DESI and Simons Observatory experiments. Specifically, the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) and CMB lensing convergence, along with cluster virial mass estimates are used as features to train the machine learning models. The predicted optical depths are combined with kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements to estimate individual cluster radial peculiar velocities. The method is shown to recover an unbiased estimate of the pairwise velocity statistics of the simulated cluster sample. The model's efficacy is demonstrated for halos with mass range $10^{13} M\_{\odot} < M\_{200} < 10^{15} M\_{\odot}$ over a redshift range $0<z<1$, and validated in the presence of primary CMB, instrument noise, lensing convergence noise, and potential uncertainties in halo virial mass estimates. We apply the method to ACT CMB data, using ACT DR4 component-separated maps for tSZ and CMB lensing and ACT DR5 maps for kSZ, in conjunction with galaxy clusters observed in the SDSS DR15 spectroscopic survey. We demonstrate that the machine learning approach is an effective one to analyze data from current and upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and CCAT, and galaxy surveys, such as DESI and Roman, for which the pairwise velocity statistics can provide valuable insights into the properties of neutrinos and gravity on cosmic scales.

2025-05-20, **A JWST View of the Overmassive Black Hole in NGC 4486B**, Behzad Tahmasebzadeh et.al., [2505.14676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14676v1)

 We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of $M\_{BH} = 3.6^{+0.6}\_{-0.6} \times 10^8 \, M\_{\odot}$, slightly lower but significantly more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent a lower limit. The inferred black hole mass corresponds to approximately 4-13% of the total stellar mass, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster, our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with $M\_{DM}/M\_{*} < 0.5$ within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.

2025-05-20, **Distribution of Dark Matter in Galaxies**, P. Steffen et.al., [2505.14426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14426v1)

 Properties of dark matter particles are investigated using astronomical data evaluated by the SPARC-group: the data of 2693 rotational data points from 153 different galaxies have been combined to an average gravitational behavior of the galaxies. The ratio of dark matter mass to the baryonic mass within the galaxies is determined, as well as the distributions of dark matter masses, mass densities and rotational velocities

2025-05-20, **Searching for Light Dark Matter and Dark Sectors with the NA64 experiment at the CERN SPS**, Yu. M. Andreev et.al., [2505.14291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14291v1)

 Since its approval in 2016, NA64 has pioneered light dark matter (LDM) searches with electron, positron, muon, and hadron beams. The experiment has successfully met its primary objectives, as outlined in the EPPS input (2018), and even exceeded them, producing results that demonstrate its ability to operate in a near-background-free environment. The Physics Beyond Collider (PBC) initiative at CERN recognizes NA64's contributions as complementary and worthy of continued exploration. Its key advantage over beam-dump approaches is that the signal rate scales as the square of the coupling rather than the fourth power, reducing the required number of beam particles for the same sensitivity.   To fully exploit the NA64 physics potential, an upgrade during LS3 will enable the experiment to run in background-free mode at higher SPS beam rates. Planned upgrades include: (a) improved detector hermeticity with a new veto hadron calorimeter, (b) enhanced particle identification with a synchrotron radiation detector, and (c) increased beam rates via upgraded electronics.   With the recently strengthened NA64 collaboration, stable operations and timely data analysis are planned for LHC Run 4. The expected beam exposures are approximately 1e13 electrons, 1e11 positrons (at 40 and 60 GeV), and 2e13 muons on target. This will allow NA64 to explore new LDM parameter space, with the potential for discovery or conclusive exclusion of many well-motivated models.

2025-05-20, **3D matter power spectrum correspondence to 1D Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum**, Ivan Ridkokasha et.al., [2505.14258v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14258v1)

 The 3D distribution of matter at small scales encodes valuable information about the nature of dark matter and other fundamental physics. A prominent probe of such scales outside galaxies is the Lyman-alpha forest, which studies absorption features in the spectra of high-redshift quasars caused by neutral hydrogen. The measured quantity is the power spectrum of the absorbed flux, which indirectly traces the underlying matter distribution. However, the connection between the measured flux power spectrum and the underlying 3D dark matter power spectrum is highly nontrivial. The flux power spectrum (i) represents a one-dimensional projection of the density field; (ii) traces only neutral hydrogen, subject to thermodynamic pressure; and (iii) is a nonlinear function of local matter density. Additionally, thermal broadening and redshift-space distortions-determined not only by the hydrogen distribution but also by its thermal state and local velocity field-further complicate interpretation. To robustly constrain dark matter properties using the Lyman-alpha forest, these systematics must be carefully modeled and controlled. In this paper, we present a simple phenomenological recipe for mapping the 3D matter power spectrum to the flux power spectrum. We first motivate our approach in the linear regime, then extend it to later times and into the nonlinear regime. We validate our model against a broad suite of warm and cold dark matter simulations, demonstrating that our recipe yields consistent and accurate estimates across a wide parameter space.

2025-05-19, **Can local White Dwarfs constrain Dark Matter interactions?**, Pooja Bhattacharjee et.al., [2505.13629v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13629v1)

 We investigate whether nearby white dwarfs (WDs) can constrain dark matter (DM) interactions with ordinary matter. As experimental sensitivity improves, driven by the Gaia mission, the sample volume of nearby WDs has been increasing over recent years. We carefully select a sample of ten cold, isolated, non-magnetic WDs within 13~pc of the Sun. We model their carbon-oxygen interior using a finite temperature relativistic equation of state and model atmospheres to infer their core temperatures. This enables us to perform a thorough estimation of the DM capture rate and evaporation mass using actual astrophysical observations. Given the low local DM density, we focus on DM that annihilates into long-lived mediators, which escape the WD and later decay into photons. While \textit{Fermi}-LAT data shows no significant gamma-ray excess, future telescopes, CTA North \& South, LHAASO, SWGO, could probe DM-nucleon cross sections down to $\sim 10^{-41}~\text{cm}^2$ for DM masses above the TeV scale. Our results are competitive with current direct detection bounds (e.g., LZ) in the multi-TeV regime. This work underscores the importance of systematic WD studies in the broader landscape of DM detection and demonstrates the synergy between astrophysical and terrestrial searches in exploring DM interactions.

2025-05-19, **Viability of post-inflationary freeze-in with precision cosmology**, Anirban Biswas et.al., [2505.13624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13624v1)

 Prediction of inflationary observables from the temperature fluctuation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) can play a pivotal role in predicting the reheating dynamics in the early universe. In this work, we highlight how the inflationary observables, in particular the spectral index $n\_s$, can play a potential role in constraining the post-inflationary dark matter (DM) production. We demonstrate a novel way of constraining the non-thermal production of DM via UV freeze-in which is otherwise elusive in terrestrial experiments. We consider a scenario in which DM is produced from this thermal plasma via a dimension-five operator. The mutual connection between $n\_s$ and relic density of DM via the reheating temperature, $T\_{\rm RH}$, enables us to put constraints on the DM parameter space. For the minimal choice of the inflationary model parameters and DM mass between $1\,\rm MeV$ to $1\,\rm TeV$, we found that Planck alone can exclude the cut-off scale of the dimension-five operator $\Lambda \lesssim 10^{12}\,\rm GeV$ which is significantly stronger than any other existing constraints on such minimal scenario. If we impose the combined prediction form Planck and recently released data by ACT, the exclusion limit can reach up to the Planck scale for TeV-scale dark matter.

2025-05-19, **Dark Matter in an Evanescent Three-Brane Randall-Sundrum Scenario**, Andrea Donini et.al., [2505.13601v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13601v1)

 Apart from its gravitational interactions, dark matter (DM) has remained so far elusive in laboratory searches. One possible explanation is that the relevant interactions to explain its relic abundance are mainly gravitational. In this work we consider an extradimensional Randall-Sundrum scenario with a TeV-PeV IR brane, where the Standard Model is located, and a GeV-TeV deep IR (DIR) one, where the DM lies. When the curvatures of the bulk to the left and right of the IR brane are very similar, the tension of the IR brane is significantly smaller than that of the other two branes, and therefore we term it \evanescent". In this setup, the relic abundance of DM arises from the freezeout mechanism, thanks to DM annihilations into radions and gravitons. Focusing on a scalar singlet DM candidate, we compute and apply current and future constraints from direct, indirect and collider-based searches. Our findings demonstrate the viability of this scenario and highlight its potential testability in upcoming experiments. We also discuss the possibility of inferring the number of branes if the radion and several Kaluza-Klein graviton resonances are detected at a future collider.

2025-05-19, **Forward vs Backward: Improving BAO Constraints with Field-Level Inference**, Ivana Babić et.al., [2505.13588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13588v1)

 We present results of field-level inference of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale $r\_s$ on rest-frame dark matter halo catalogs. Our field-level constraint on $r\_s$ is obtained by explicitly sampling the initial conditions along with the bias and noise parameters via the LEFTfield EFT-based forward model. Comparing with a standard reconstruction pipeline applied to the same data and over the same scales, the field-level constraint on the BAO scale improves by a factor of $\sim 1.2-1.4$ over standard BAO reconstruction. We point to a surprisingly simple source of the additional information.

2025-05-19, **Single arm interferometry to probe the scalar field dark matter**, Antonio Capolupo et.al., [2505.13574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13574v1)

 We analyse the interaction of photons with a scalar dark matter field \phi and we propose to use a single arm interferometer to reveal this interaction and constrain the parameters of the scalar dark matter model. By considering a beam of coherent light and two spatially separated squeezing operations, we show that the interaction of photons with scalar dark matter leads to an observable deviation in the outgoing light state, with respect to free evolution. Therefore the single arm interferometer may yield a novel revelation method for scalar dark matter.

2025-05-19, **HydroX, a light dark matter search with hydrogen-doped liquid xenon time projection chambers**, W. H. Lippincott et.al., [2505.13402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13402v1)

 Experimental efforts searching for dark matter particles over the last few decades have ruled out many candidates led by the new generation of tonne-scale liquid xenon. For light dark matter, hydrogen could be a better target than xenon as it would offer a better kinematic match to the low mass particles. This article describes the HydroX concept, an idea to expand the dark matter sensitivity reach of large liquid xenon detectors by adding hydrogen to the liquid xenon. We discuss the nature of signal generation in liquid xenon to argue that the signal produced at the interaction site by a dark matter-hydrogen interaction could be significantly enhanced over the same interaction on xenon, increasing the sensitivity to the lightest particles. We discuss the technical implications of adding hydrogen to a xenon detector, as well as some background considerations. Finally, we make projections as to the potential sensitivity of a HydroX implementation and discuss next steps.

2025-05-19, **Constraining Reheating Temperature, Inflaton-SM Coupling and Dark Matter Mass in Light of ACT DR6 Observations**, Rajesh Mondal et.al., [2505.13387v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13387v1)

 We explore the phenomenological implications of the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 observations, in combination with Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, on the physics of inflation and post-inflationary reheating. We focus on the $\alpha$-attractor class of inflationary models (both E- and T-models) and consider two reheating scenarios: perturbative inflaton ($\phi$) decay ($\phi \rightarrow bb$) and inflaton annihilation ($\phi \phi \rightarrow bb$) into Standard Model (SM) bosonic particles ($b$). By solving the Boltzmann equations, we derive bounds on key reheating parameters, including the reheating temperature, the inflaton equation of state (EoS), and the inflaton-SM coupling, in light of ACT data. To accurately constrain the coupling, we incorporate the Bose enhancement effect in the decay width. To ensure the validity of our perturbative approach, we also identify the regime where nonperturbative effects, such as parametric resonance, become significant. Additionally, we include indirect constraints from primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), which can impact the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N\_{\rm eff}$. These constraints further bound the reheating temperature, particularly in scenarios with a stiff EoS. Finally, we analyze dark matter (DM) production through purely gravitational interactions during reheating and determine the allowed mass ranges consistent with the constrained reheating parameter space and recent ACT data. Our results highlight the constraining power of next-generation CMB datasets on inflationary dynamics, reheating, and the DM parameter space.

2025-05-19, **Fermionic sub-GeV Dark Matter from evaporating Primordial Black Holes at DarkSide-50**, The DarkSide-50 Collaboration et.al., [2505.13093v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13093v1)

 We present a search for boosted dark matter from Primordial Black Holes (PBH) evaporation using the DarkSide-50 ionization-signal-only dataset corresponding to the experiment's ($12202\pm180$) ${\rm kg\: d}$ exposure. We focus on evaporation of PBHs with masses in the range [$10^{14},\,10^{16}$] g producing Dirac fermionic dark matter particles with sub-GeV kinetic energy. These relativistic particles, with energies up to hundreds of MeV, can generate detectable signals for masses below $\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV. The absence of a signal enables setting complementary limits to those derived from cosmological observations and direct detection searches for cosmic ray-boosted dark matter.

2025-05-19, **Experimental Particle Physics Priorities 2025: A String Phenomenology Perspective**, Jonathan DeMont et.al., [2505.12965v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12965v1)

 With the SNOWMASS 2021 process in the US and the on--going European Strategy Report 2025, the field of elementary particle physics is undergoing detailed community evaluation, and the experimental particle physics program, which requires substantial public investment, is under scrutiny. We offer an assessment of the current experimental particle physics priorities from a string phenomenology point of view. String theory provides a perturbatively consistent framework for quantum gravity. String phenomenology aims to connect between string theory and observational data. String theory is a consistent theory of quantum gravity that contains the other fundamental constituents of matter and interactions. As all forms of energy couple to gravity, string theory provides a framework that reproduces the structures of the Standard Model of particle physics and gives rise to detailed physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model, {\it e.g.} dark matter candidates, axions, additional gauge symmetries, etc. Given this breadth, we propose that from a string phenomenology perspective, the experimental particle physics priority is the nature of the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. An ideal facility in the near future to study this sector is a hadron collider at 50--60 TeV that utilises contemporary magnet technology and can be built in 10--15 years from decision.

2025-05-19, **Lecture Notes: WISPs in gamma-ray astrophysics**, Francesca Calore et.al., [2505.12905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12905v1)

 These lecture notes provide an overview of high-energy astrophysical processes involving axions, axion-like particles (ALPs), and other weakly interacting slim particles (WISPs) focusing on their potential observational signatures in astrophysical environments. After introducing key concepts in high-energy astrophysics, we present the fundamental properties of WISPs, emphasizing their phenomenological implications. Particular attention is given to ALP-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields and the possible decay signatures of ALPs in sources such as active galactic nuclei, galaxy clusters, and cosmic-ray accelerators. These effects can lead to distinctive modifications in astrophysical spectra, spatial distributions, and polarization patterns, providing unique probes of physics beyond the Standard Model. We discuss their role in dark matter scenarios and their potential impact on high-energy observations. The lecture series is supplemented by hands-on tutorials, including exercises on axion electrodynamics and an analysis of gamma-ray data from NGC 1275 to search for ALP-photon conversion signatures.

2025-05-20, **TransFit: An Efficient Framework for Transient Light-Curve Fitting with Time-Dependent Radiative Diffusion**, Liang-Duan Liu et.al., [2505.13825v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13825v1)

 Modeling the light curves (LCs) of luminous astronomical transients, such as supernovae, is crucial for understanding their progenitor physics, particularly with the exponential growth of survey data. However, existing methods face limitations: efficient semi-analytical models (e.g., Arnett-like) employ significant physical simplifications (like time-invariant temperature profiles and simplified heating distributions), often compromising accuracy, especially for early-time LCs. Conversely, detailed numerical radiative transfer simulations, while accurate, are computationally prohibitive for large datasets. This paper introduces TransFit, a novel framework that numerically solves a generalized energy conservation equation, explicitly incorporating time-dependent radiative diffusion, continuous radioactive or central engine heating, and ejecta expansion dynamics. The model accurately captures the influence of key ejecta properties and diverse heating source characteristics on light curve morphology, including peak luminosity, rise time, and overall shape. Furthermore, TransFit provides self-consistent modeling of the transition from shock-cooling to $^{56}$Ni}-powered light curves. By combining physical realism with computational speed, TransFit provides a powerful tool for efficiently inverting LCs and extracting detailed physical insights from the vast datasets of current and future transient surveys.

2025-05-19, **Multipole Analysis and Application to Supernova Remnant X-ray Images**, Denis A. Leahy et.al., [2505.13671v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13671v1)

 We develop a multipole analysis method for images with a circular boundary, then apply it to supernova remnant (SNR) images. The morphology of SNR images is related to several factors, including the inhomogeneities of the supernova ejecta and of the circumstellar medium in which the ejecta and shock wave travel. The current multipole method corrects some errors in a previously presented method, and applies the new analysis to test for differences in X-ray image morphology between Type Ia and core-collapse type SNRs. We find there is no clear difference between the two SNR types in morphology as measured by multipole moments.

2025-05-19, **Distinguishing Distance Duality breaking models using electromagnetic and gravitational waves measurements**, Chiara De Leo et.al., [2505.13613v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13613v1)

 Several assumptions at the foundation of the standard cosmological model have as a direct consequence a specific relation between cosmological distances, known as the distance duality relation, whose violation would be a smoking gun of deviations from standard cosmology. We explore the role of upcoming gravitational wave observations in investigating possible deviations from the distance duality relation, alongside the more commonly used supernovae. We find that, when combined with baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational waves will provide similar constraining power to the combination of baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae. Moreover, the combination of observables with different sensitivities to electromagnetic and gravitational physics provides a promising way to discriminate among different physical mechanisms that could lead to violations of the distance duality relation.

2025-05-19, **Type Ia supernova growth-rate measurement with LSST simulations: intrinsic scatter systematics**, Bastien Carreres et.al., [2505.13290v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13290v1)

 Measurement of the growth rate of structures ($\fsig$) with Type Ia supernovae (\sns) will improve our understanding of the nature of dark energy and enable tests of general relativity. In this paper, we generate simulations of the 10 year \sn\ dataset of the Rubin-LSST survey, including a correlated velocity field from a N-body simulation and realistic models of \sns\ properties and their correlations with host-galaxy properties. We find, similar to SN~Ia analyses that constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameters $w\_0w\_a$, that constraints on $\fsig$ can be biased depending on the intrinsic scatter of \sns. While for the majority of intrinsic scatter models we recover $\fsig$ with a precision of $\sim13 - 14\%$, for the most realistic dust-based model, we find that the presence of non-Gaussianities in Hubble diagram residuals leads to a bias on $\fsig$ of about $\sim-20\%$. When trying to correct for the dust-based intrinsic scatter, we find that the propagation of the uncertainty on the model parameters does not significantly increase the error on $\fsig$. We also find that while the main component of the error budget of $\fsig$ is the statistical uncertainty ($>75\%$ of the total error budget), the systematic error budget is dominated by the uncertainty on the damping parameter, $\sigma\_u$, that gives an empirical description of the effect of redshift space distortions on the velocity power spectrum. Our results motivate a search for new methods to correct for the non-Gaussian distribution of the Hubble diagram residuals, as well as an improved modeling of the damping parameter.

2025-05-19, **High-Velocity Molecular Clouds in M83**, Maki Nagata et.al., [2505.12757v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12757v1)

 High-velocity clouds (HVCs), which are gas clouds moving at high velocity relative to the galactic disk, may play a critical role in galaxy evolution, potentially supplying gas to the disk and triggering star formation. In this study, we focus on the nearby face-on barred spiral galaxy M83, where high spatial resolution, high-sensitivity CO (1-0) data are available. We identified molecular clouds and searched for clouds with velocities deviating by more than 50km/s from the disk velocity field as HVCs. A total of 10 HVCs were detected -- nine redshifted and one blueshifted -- clearly highlighting an asymmetry in their velocity distribution. These HVCs have radii of 30-80 pc, masses on the order of $10^5 M\_\odot$, and velocity dispersions of 3-20 km/s, displaying a tendency toward higher velocity dispersion compared to disk molecular clouds in M83. Most of the HVCs do not overlap with the candidates of supernova remnants, and the energy needed to drive HVCs at such high velocities exceeds single supernova energy. Together with the asymmetry in their velocity distribution, we thus conclude that most of the HVCs found in this study are inflow from outside the M83's disk.
