2025-01-06, **Design and Implementation of the Cosmic Ray Tagger System for the ICARUS detector at FNAL**, A. Aduszkiewicz et.al., [2501.03034v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03034v1)

 The ICARUS-T600 Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber is operating at Fermilab at shallow depth and thus exposed to a high flux of cosmic rays that can fake neutrino interactions. A cosmic ray tagging (CRT) system ($\sim$1100 m$^2$), surrounding the cryostat with two layers of fiber embedded plastic scintillators, was developed to mitigate the cosmic ray induced background. Using nanosecond-level timing information, the CRT can distinguish incoming cosmic rays from outgoing particles from neutrino interactions in the TPC. In this paper an overview of the CRT system, its installation and commissioning at Fermilab, and its performance are discussed.

2025-01-06, **Searches for primary photons and neutrinos with the Pierre Auger Observatory**, Nicolas M. Gonzalez et.al., [2501.02923v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02923v2)

 The Pierre Auger Observatory stands as the largest detector for ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays. The Observatory is also sensitive to UHE photons and neutrinos that can be produced along with UHE cosmic rays or in top-down processes, such as the decay of dark matter particles. The search for these neutral particles relies on the hybrid measurements of extensive air showers, combining a fluorescence detector with a surface detector array and an underground muon detector. We present an overview of the searches for UHE photons and neutrinos utilizing data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. Currently, no photon or neutrino candidates have been identified. Consequently, we report on the most stringent limits to the integral UHE photon and neutrino fluxes above 50 PeV and 100 PeV, respectively, from diffuse and point-like steady sources. These limits led to strong constraints on theoretical models describing the cosmological evolution of the acceleration sites and the nature of dark-matter particles. Lastly, we briefly comment on the searches for these neutral particles in coincidence with gravitational wave events, underscoring the pivotal role of the Observatory in the context of multi-messenger astronomy at the highest energies.

2025-01-06, **The NewAthena mission concept in the context of the next decade of X-ray astronomy**, Mike Cruise et.al., [2501.03100v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03100v1)

 Large X-ray observatories such as Chandra and XMM-Newton have been delivering scientific breakthroughs in research fields as diverse as our Solar System, the astrophysics of stars, stellar explosions and compact objects, accreting super-massive black holes, and large-scale structures traced by the hot plasma permeating and surrounding galaxy groups and clusters. The recently launched observatory XRISM is opening in earnest the new observational window of non-dispersive high-resolution spectroscopy. However, several quests are left open, such as the effect of the stellar radiation field on the habitability of nearby planets, the Equation-of-State regulating matter in neutron stars, the origin and distribution of metals in the Universe, the processes driving the cosmological evolution of the baryons locked in the gravitational potential of Dark Matter and the impact of supermassive black hole growth on galaxy evolution, just to mention a few. Furthermore, X-ray astronomy is a key player in multi-messenger astrophysics. Addressing these quests experimentally requires an order-of-magnitude leap in sensitivity, spectroscopy and survey capabilities with respect to existing X-ray observatories. This paper succinctly summarizes the main areas where high-energy astrophysics is expected to contribute to our understanding of the Universe in the next decade and describes a new mission concept under study by the European Space Agency, the scientific community worldwide and two International Partners (JAXA and NASA), designed to enable transformational discoveries: NewAthena. This concept inherits its basic payload design from a previous study carried out until 2022, Athena.

2025-01-06, **Cosmic Whispers of the Early Universe: Gravitational Waves and Dark Matter from Primordial Black Holes**, Antonio Junior Iovino et.al., [2501.03065v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03065v1)

 Various mechanisms have been suggested for the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), and this thesis focuses on the standard mechanism based on the critical collapse of cosmological fluctuations. The underlying idea is that during inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early Universe, large cosmological fluctuations could have been generated. After inflation, when the cosmic horizon reached a size comparable to these fluctuations, if the latter were high enough, they could collapse and form a PBH.   Beyond the fascinating possibility that these compact objects might make up all or part of the Dark Matter (DM) we observe today, their formation and existence is also associated with the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves could contribute to the merger events observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) or account for signals detected by pulsar timing array experiments (PTA). In the first part of this thesis, we investigate the PBH scenario, examining the computation of the abundance beyond the Gaussian paradigm. In the second part, we discuss how PBH formation can produce a stochastic GW background and how observations, related to recent experiments such as LVK and PTA collaborations, can help in distinguishing between different PBH production models. Finally, in the last part, we investigate some aspects of the interplay between black holes and fundamental physics in the early Universe, describing some characteristics and challenges of various PBH production models.

2025-01-06, **First result from tetrafluoroethane (C$_2$H$_2$F$_4$) superheated emulsion detector for dark matter search at JUSL**, V. Kumar et.al., [2501.02833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02833v1)

 The superheated emulsion detector consisting of the droplets of tetra-fluoroethane (C2HC$\_2$H$\_2$F$\_4$2F4) has been fabricated at the laboratory and installed at the 555m deep underground laboratory, JUSL during July to Dec 2022. The 500ml detector ran for an effective period of 48.6 days at a threshold of 5.87 keV with an exposure of 2.47 kg-days. The acoustic signals produced due to the bubble nucleation were collected by the acoustic sensor and FPGAbased data acquisition system. The data shows a minimum sensitivity of SI-nucleon for carbon at WIMP mass of 22.81 GeV/c$^2$ and SD (p) for fluorine at 30.67 GeV/c$^2$. The threshold of WIMP mass is 5.16 GeV/c$^2$ for F and 4.44 GeV/c$^2$ for C at the operating threshold of 5.87 keV. The first result of the dark matter direct search experiment named InDEx with tetra-fluoro-ethane active liquid from JUSL underground laboratory is reported in this article.
