2026-02-04, **Primordial black holes as cosmic accelerators of light dark matter: Novel direct detection constraints**, Sk Jeesun et.al., [2602.04858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04858v1)

 Current multiton dark matter (DM) detectors are largely incapable of detecting light dark matter from the Galactic halo due to the energy threshold limitations of their recoil measurements. However, primordial black holes (PBHs) can evaporate via Hawking radiation to particles whose energies are set by the black hole temperature. Consequently, weakly interacting light dark matter (or dark radiation) particles produced in this manner can reach the Earth with sufficient flux and kinetic energy above the experimental thresholds. This opens up a novel avenue to probe the light dark sector in terrestrial experiments. In this work, we explore this possibility by considering fermionic DM produced through PBH evaporation and investigate its electron recoil signatures in direct detection experiments. We analyze both energy independent (constant) and energy dependent (scalar and vector mediated) DM-electron interactions, highlighting the strong dependence of the recoil spectra on the underlying Lorentz structure of the interaction. In addition, we also account for the attenuation effects due to loss of kinetic energy while DM traverses through Earth's crust, which can significantly modify the incoming DM flux. Incorporating these effects carefully, we place constraints on light DM using the electron recoil data from XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T. Finally, we also discuss the detection prospects of such dark matter in current and future generation neutrino detectors, such as Super Kamiokande and Hyper Kamiokande.

2026-02-04, **Exploring supernova neutrino mass ordering at DUNE via quantum entanglement**, Adikiran Johny et.al., [2602.04800v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04800v1)

 The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) offers strong sensitivity to neutrinos from a Galactic core collapse supernova, providing a powerful probe of neutrino flavor conversion and the neutrino mass ordering. In this work, we study supernova neutrino oscillations at DUNE using quantum entanglement as an organizing framework. Treating the three flavor neutrino system as an effective multipartite quantum state, we quantify flavor correlations through the entanglement of formation, concurrence, and negativity, expressed directly in terms of flavor survival and transition probabilities. Benchmark scenarios defined by representative variations of the electron neutrino survival probability are constructed for each entanglement measure. Event rates and fluences are computed for a supernova at 10 kpc, and the mass ordering sensitivity is evaluated using detector-level simulations performed with the \texttt{SNOwGLoBES} framework, employing the Garching supernova flux model and including the dominant detection channels in liquid argon: $ν\_e$ and $\barν\_e$ charged-current interactions on argon and elastic scattering on electrons. We analyze both individual and combined detection channels and incorporate $5\%$ normalization and energy calibration systematic uncertainties. Our results show that DUNE achieves a $5σ$ determination of the neutrino mass ordering for a supernova at distances of $\sim 20$~kpc for the $ν\_e$ charged current channel and $\sim 2$~kpc for the $\barν\_e$ channel, with the reach depending on the entanglement scenario considered. These results demonstrate that entanglement based observables provide a complementary and robust framework for probing supernova neutrino oscillations and the neutrino mass ordering.

2026-02-04, **Near-Resonant Thermal Leptogenesis**, Angus Spalding et.al., [2602.04772v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04772v1)

 We study leptogenesis in the quasi-degenerate but non-resonant regime. Expanding the CP asymmetry parameter near degeneracy and imposing the conservative non-resonance condition that the mass splitting must be much greater than the right-handed neutrino decay rates $ΔM > 100Γ\_i$, yields the universal upper bound $ε\leq 1/200$, independent of both the effective neutrino masses and the right-handed neutrino mass. We investigate vanilla and flavoured near-resonant leptogenesis and find that successful leptogenesis by right-handed neutrino decays can occur for $M \gtrsim 100~\mathrm{GeV}$ independent of washout regime, extending the viable parameter space of thermal leptogenesis down to the electroweak scale without invoking resonance. We also analyse near-resonant thermal leptogenesis during reheating and show that successful baryon asymmetry generation is compatible with reheating temperatures as low as $T\_{RH}\simeq 10\rm GeV$ without relying on non-thermal production. Finally, we present a consistent framework for incorporating flavour effects in near-resonant leptogenesis during reheating. Overall, near-resonant thermal leptogenesis offers a controlled alternative regime to resonant leptogenesis, lowering the leptogenesis scale to the electroweak scale, without reliance on a disputed regulator used in resonant leptogenesis.

2026-02-04, **Benchmark Study of CEvNS Nuclear Recoil Observables for B, Mg, Ti, and Zr Targets Using Geant4**, Yusuf Havvat et.al., [2602.04771v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04771v1)

 Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) provides a well-defined framework for studying nuclear recoil observables in low-energy neutrino interactions. In this work, we present a comparative Monte Carlo benchmark study of CEvNS-induced nuclear recoils for four target nuclei (B, Mg, Ti, and Zr) using the Geant4 simulation toolkit and the ROOT analysis framework. The study focuses on relative differences in recoil-energy spectra, nuclear form-factor effects, and angular distributions under identical simulation conditions. A deliberately simplified detector geometry is employed to ensure a controlled and transparent comparison between target materials, rather than to model a specific experimental setup. The results highlight how nuclear mass and form-factor suppression influence CEvNS recoil observables and provide a reference-level comparison that may be useful for material-selection studies in CEvNS-related simulations.

2026-02-04, **Charged lepton flavor violating decays $Z\to \ell_α\ell_β$ in the inverse seesaw**, Adrián González-Quiterio et.al., [2602.04168v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04168v1)

 After confirmation of massiveness and mixing of neutrinos, by neutrino oscillation data, the origin of neutrino mass and the occurrence of charged-lepton-flavor non-conservation in nature have become two main objectives for the physics of elementary particles. Taking inspiration from both matters, we address the decays $Z\to\ell\_α\ell\_β$, with $\ell\_α\ne\ell\_β$, thus violating charged-lepton flavor. We calculate the set of contributing one-loop diagrams characterized by virtual neutral leptons, both light and heavy, emerged from the inverse seesaw mechanism for the generation of neutrino mass. By neglecting charged-lepton and light-neutrino masses, and then assuming that the mass spectrum of the heavy neutral leptons is degenerate, we find that a relation $\textrm{Br}\big( Z\to\ell\_α\ell\_β\big)\propto\big\| η\_{βα} \big\|^2$, with $η$ the matrix describing non-unitarity effects in light-lepton mixing, is fulfilled. Our quantitative analysis, which considers both scenarios of degenerate and non-degenerate masses of heavy neutral leptons, takes into account upper bounds on $η\_{μe}$, imposed by current constraints on the decay $μ\to eγ$ from the MEG II experiment, while projected future sensitivity of this experiment is considered as well. We find that, even though current constraints on $Z\to\ell\_α\ell\_β$, by the ATLAS Collaboration, remain far from inverse-seesaw contributions, improved sensitivity from in-plans machines, such as the Future Circular Collider and the Circular Electron Positron Collider, shall be able to probe this mass-generating mechanism through these decays.

2026-02-03, **Deep-Learning Denoising of Radio Observations for Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic-Ray Detection**, Zhisen Lai et.al., [2602.03818v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03818v1)

 Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) can be detected via the broadband radio pulses produced by their extensive air showers. The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a planned radio observatory that aims to deploy autonomous antenna arrays over areas of order $\sim 10^5\,\mathrm{km}^2$ to detect this emission. However, Galactic and instrumental radio backgrounds make the identification of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) pulses a central challenge. Here, we present a deep convolutional denoiser model that jointly processes each GRAND antenna trace in the time and frequency domains, allowing the network to learn transient pulse morphology and broadband spectral features while suppressing background noise. By training the model on $4.1\times 10^5$ simulated traces that include detailed UHECR radio emission and realistic detector response and noise, we find a median output-SNR improvement of $\sim 15-23\,\mathrm{dB}$ in the $50-200~\mathrm{MHz}$ band and a reduction of the normalized mean squared error of the waveform by about an order of magnitude relative to a Hilbert-envelope denoiser baseline. We also verify that applying the denoiser to noise-only windows does not produce spurious pulse candidates. Near the detection threshold, the denoiser increases the number of antennas contributing reliable pulse timing by a factor of $\sim 2-3$, which correspondingly tightens direction reconstruction uncertainties. When we additionally require accurate recovery of the waveform shape, the denoiser yields a median gain of $\sim 3-4$ antennas usable for energy reconstruction at SNR$\simeq 5-6$, strengthening event-level direction and energy estimates in sparse radio arrays.

2026-02-03, **Quantum speed limit time for bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations in matter with non-standard interactions**, Abhishek Kumar Jha et.al., [2602.03748v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03748v1)

 In the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework, we investigate the transition probabilities of an initial muon neutrino flavor state in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSIs) characterized by complex off-diagonal ($\|ε\_{αβ}\|e^{iφ\_{αβ}}$) and diagonal parameters ($\|ε\_{αα}-ε\_{ββ}\|$), including a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, under both normal (NO) and inverted mass ordering (IO) scenarios. Within these scenarios and through the lens of mode entanglement, bipartite entanglement measures such as entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement are quantified in terms of the transition probabilities, which can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments. Using these two bipartite entanglement measures, we further explore the quantum speed limit (QSL) time, which describes how rapidly bipartite entanglement evolves during neutrino oscillations. We illustrate our results using the baseline lengths and energies corresponding to ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, such as T2K, NO$ν$A, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. In the presence of a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, both with and without NSI effects, we compare the QSL time behavior for bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations for NO and IO. The most pronounced discrepancies in the QSL time for bipartite entanglement arise from the off-diagonal NSI parameter $ε\_{μτ}$ across both the NO and IO scenarios. We emphasize that among all the experiments considered, NO$ν$A and DUNE exhibit a rapid suppression of bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations in the standard oscillation scenario with NO at the end of their baseline lengths for the corresponding best-fit value of CP-violating phase. Our results hint at a possible imprint of new physics in neutrino oscillations.

2026-02-03, **Asymmetric dark matter from leptogenesis in type-III seesaw framework with modular $S_4$ symmetry**, Abhishek et.al., [2602.03384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03384v1)

 We present a unified framework for neutrino masses, baryogenesis, and dark matter based on a modular $S\_4$ symmetry combined with a type-III seesaw mechanism. All Yukawa couplings, CP phases, and flavor textures originate from a single complex modulus $τ$, whose vacuum expectation value controls both visible and dark sector dynamics. The same modular parameter fixes the neutrino mass matrix, determines the CP asymmetries driving resonant leptogenesis, and correlates the resulting baryon and dark matter abundances. A detailed numerical analysis shows that the model reproduces all neutrino oscillation data within the $3σ$ NuFIT~5.2 (2024) ranges for normal ordering, predicting $δ\_{\rm CP} \simeq \pm (150^\circ-180^\circ)$, $\sum m\_ν\simeq(0.06-0.08)~\mathrm{eV}$, and an effective Majorana mass $m\_{ββ} \simeq (8 - 18)\times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{eV}$, testable in next-generation neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. The same modular Yukawas yield resonantly enhanced CP asymmetries $\|ε\_{L,χ}\| \sim 10^{-9}-10^{-6}$ at $M\_Σ\sim 10^{7}~\mathrm{GeV}$, successfully generating the observed baryon asymmetry $η\_B\simeq6\times10^{-10}$ and dark relic density $Ω\_χh^2\simeq0.12$ without additional free parameters. The predicted correlation $Ω\_χ/Ω\_B\simeq5.4$ fixes the dark matter mass to $m\_χ\simeq0.1-2~\mathrm{GeV}$, consistent with all current constraints. This framework therefore realizes a fully predictive baryon$-$dark matter co-genesis, where the geometry of the modular symmetry links the origin of flavor, CP violation, and the cosmic matter asymmetry.

2026-02-04, **Large-scale halo velocity correlations and the impact of finite simulation volumes**, Yao-Tsung Chuang et.al., [2602.04485v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04485v1)

 The velocity correlation functions directly measured from the peculiar velocity field of dark matter in numerical simulations are known to have an amplitude lower than that predicted by theoretical models at large scales. The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k\_{\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)σ\_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k\_{\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $fσ\_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression. These results highlight the importance of accounting for missing long-wavelength modes when developing simulation-based modeling of velocity statistics, such as emulators.

2026-02-04, **Neutron Dark Decay and Exotic Compact Objects**, M. Vikiaris et.al., [2602.04477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04477v1)

 Recent measurements of the compact star XTE J1814-338, with a mass of $M=1.2\_{-0.05}^{+0.05}\ M\_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=7\_{-0.4}^{+0.4} \ {\rm Km}$ alongside those of HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77\_{-0.17}^{+0.20}\ M\_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=10.4\_{-0.78}^{+0.86} \ {\rm Km}$, provide compelling evidence for the potential existence of exotic matter in neutron star cores. These observations offer important insights into the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. Recently, Fornal and Grinstein, in order to overcame the discrepancy between the neutron lifetime measured in beam and bottle experiments, proposed the existence of neutron dark decay. In the present work, an effort is made to connect the interpretation of the above exotic compact objects with the possible existence of dark particles, assumed to be products of neutron dark decay. Our hypothesis offers an advantage over comparable proposals, as the coexistence of dark matter and hadronic matter within neutron stars emerges from an intrinsic mechanism, thereby obviating the need to invoke external merger-related processes. It is still unclear to what extent the proposed dark decay of the neutron is affected by the extreme environment within neutron stars. Within this framework, we examined the case in which a mechanism suppressing the dark neutron decay becomes operative at densities few times above nuclear saturation density. We found that the proposed alternative explanation accommodates the simultaneous existence of neutron dark decay while consistently predicting both the two solar mass limit and the presence of compact objects with subsolar masses.

2026-02-04, **Parametric Resonance and Backreaction Effects in Magnetogenesis from Ultralight Dark Matter**, Nirmalya Brahma et.al., [2602.04285v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04285v1)

 We take a more detailed look at the recently proposed magnetogenesis mechanism triggered by ultralight dark matter coupled to electromagnetism. The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects.

2026-02-03, **Constraining cosmological simulations with peculiar velocities: a forward-modeling approach**, Aurélien Valade et.al., [2602.03699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03699v1)

 Numerical simulations are a key tool to decipher the dynamics of gravitation. Yet, they fail to spatially reproduce the Universe we observe, limiting comparison between observations and simulations to a statistical level. This is highly problematic for rare, faint or well studied nearby objects that are observed in a single environment. The computational cost of recovering this environment in random simulations is prohibitive.   We present Hamlet-PM, a method that enables the constraining of initial conditions for cosmological simulations so as to produce evolved numerical universes that can be directly compared to observations of the Local Universe: constrained simulations.   Our method implements the field-level forward modeling of the early-time density field from sparse and noisy measurements of late-time peculiar velocities. The dynamics are integrated with a particle-mesh gravity solver, thus probing the mildly non-linear regime. The code is applied to the Cosmicflows-4 compilation of peculiar velocities up to z < 0.05 (160 Mpc/h). The constrained ICs a re-simulated with a high precision N-body code.   A series of one hundred dark-matter only cosmological constrained simulations with a resolution of 512^3 particles in a 500^3 [Mpc/h]3 box is presented. Special attention is given to twelve prominent nearby galaxy clusters, whose simulated counterparts are matched on criteria of mass and separation. We provide a mass estimate constrained by the dynamical environment for each cluster.   Field-level forward modeling of the initial conditions produces highly constrained cosmological simulations. Currently, this method already overtakes in quality the pipeline in use in the peculiar-velocity community, although systematic biases still need to be addressed. Furthermore, improving the model is easy thanks to the inherent flexibility of the Bayesian approach.

2026-02-03, **Novel exact black hole solution in Dehnen $\left(1,4,\frac32\right)$ halo thermodynamics, photon circular motion and eikonal quasinormal modes**, David Senjaya et.al., [2602.03349v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03349v1)

 Dehnen $(1,4,\frac32)$ dark matter halo has been proven to be a valuable model for describing the surface brightness distributions of elliptical galaxies, yet its implications for black hole spacetimes remain largely unexplored. In this work, we construct a novel exact black hole solution embedded in this Dehnen halo and investigate its physical consequences. The influence of the halo on black hole thermodynamics is analyzed through the mass function, entropy, Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, allowing us to assess both local and global thermodynamic stability of the black hole-dark matter system. Our results show that the presence of a Dehnen-type halo not only stabilizes the otherwise thermodynamically unstable Schwarzschild black hole but also induces phase transitions. In addition, we study null geodesics to examine photon motion, the shadow radius and the optical appearance of the system. The dark matter halo modifies the effective potential, leading to observable changes in the photon sphere and the apparent size of the shadow. We also explore the instability of circular null geodesics and its relation to quasinormal modes in an eikonal limit. These findings highlight the significant role of realistic dark matter distributions in shaping both the thermodynamic behavior and the observable signatures of black holes, providing further insight into the interplay between dark matter halos and central black holes in galaxies.

2026-02-03, **Line-Intensity Mapping**, Tzu-Ching Chang et.al., [2602.03011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03011v1)

 Line-Intensity Mapping (LIM) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying large-scale structure and the high-redshift universe, enabling three-dimensional maps of line emission across vast cosmological volumes. In this review, we summarize the LIM framework, its key scientific goals, and its future prospects. We describe the landscape of emission line tracers, theoretical modeling approaches, anticipated signals, and data-analysis methodologies. We also discuss experimental challenges, particularly those posed by astrophysical foregrounds, and review possible mitigation strategies. Further, we highlight a range of cross-correlation science cases, linking LIM with other cosmological surveys. Finally, we summarize current and upcoming experiments and early results, including recent first detections, while outlining the outlook for future discoveries. Specifically, LIM may offer new insights into galaxy formation and evolution and cosmology, while revealing the Epoch of Reionization, Cosmic Dawn, and possibly the Cosmic Dark Ages. LIM enables cosmological measurements that complement other probes and provide unique access to the high-redshift universe, potentially shedding light on dark matter, dark energy, and cosmic inflation.

2026-02-03, **Constraints on light dark matter from primordial black hole evaporation at dark matter direct detection experiments**, Tong Zhu et.al., [2602.03010v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03010v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are able to produce light dark matter (DM) particles via Hawking radiation, and yield a flux of boosted DM that can be probed at underground DM direct detection experiments. We analyze both galactic and extragalactic contributions to the differential flux of light DM from PBH evaporation, and then compute the expected event rate from PBH boosted DM scattering off electrons or nuclei after taking into account the attenuation effect. Using recent data from DM direct detection experiments XENONnT, PandaX-4T and LZ, we set constraints on both DM-electron and DM-nucleus scattering cross sections, as well as the fraction of DM composed of PBHs $f\_{\rm PBH}$ for $9\times10^{14}-1\times10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ PBHs that are not fully evaporated today. We also investigate the spectral evolution induced by Hawking evaporation throughout the evaporation and post-evaporation regimes. The constraints on the PBH mass are then extended into the $1\times10^{13}-6\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$ window for fully evaporated PBHs.

2026-02-04, **$γ$-Ray Lines -- Signatures of Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Rays, Positron Annihilation, and Fundamental Physics**, Thomas Siegert et.al., [2602.04592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04592v1)

 The nuclear $γ$-ray lines in the MeV range of the electromagnetic spectrum hold a vast variety of astrophysical, particle-physical, and fundamental physical information that is otherwise extreme difficult to access. MeV $γ$-ray line observations provide the most direct evidence for ongoing nucleosynthesis in galaxies by measuring freshly produced radioactive isotopes from massive stars, supernovae, classical novae, or binary neutron star mergers. Their flux ratios can determine the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum in different objects and of the Milky Way as a whole. Different phases of the interstellar medium are traced by hot nucleosynthesis ejecta, cooling positrons, or cosmic-ray interactions with molecular clouds. Positron annihilation itself can be considered as an astrophysical messenger as their production and destruction in typical space environments is inevitable. Finally, as-of-yet unknown signatures from beyond standard model physics might have their elusive imprints in $γ$-ray lines. This Chapter gives an overview of historical $γ$-ray line measurements, newest results, and open questions that may only be solved by a new generation of MeV telescopes.

2026-02-04, **The Hubble Tension in Light of the Symmetry of Scale Invariance**, Frederic Courbin et.al., [2602.04532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04532v1)

 When the expansion rate of the Universe at recombination is used to infer the present expansion rate $H\_0$, the value derived in the $Λ$CDM model, $H\_0=67.4$ km/s/mpc, is about in 6$\, σ$ tension with the value measured locally, $H\_0=74$ km/s/mpc. In this work, we consider instead the expansion history in the context of the symmetry of scale-invariant vacuum (SIV model). We first perform two major cosmological tests: the Hubble diagram for type-Ia supernovae and the fundamental relation between $H\_0$, the age of the Universe, and the total density of matter, $Ω\_m$. This allows us to constrain $Ω\_m$ in SIV, with both tests giving the best agreement for $Ω\_m \simeq 0.20$. We then study the physical connections of the dynamical and thermal states of the Universe at recombination with the present Hubble constant, $H\_0$, and the present temperature, $T$, in the $Λ$CDM and SIV contexts. We find that, in SIV, the properties at recombination may be conveyed to the present ones ($T=2.726$ and $H\_0$ at $z=0$) without any tension, indicating $H\_0=74$ km/s/mpc in spite of the anchoring on the CMB. This is due to the slightly different expansion and temperature histories of the two cosmological models. Importantly, this happens to occur for $Ω\_m \simeq 0.20$, as constrained in SIV with supernovae and cosmic age. This suggests that the Hubble tension currently found between $H\_0$ values in the early and late Universe may simply be the result of $ΛCDM$ ignoring the small but still measurable effects of scale invariance.

2026-02-04, **SN 2017ati: A luminous type IIb explosion from a massive progenitor**, Z. -H. Peng et.al., [2602.04474v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04474v1)

 We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type~IIb supernova (SN)~2017ati. It reached the maximum light at about 27~d after the explosion and the light curve shows a broad, luminous peak with an absolute $r$-band magnitude of $M\_{r} = -18.48 \pm 0.16$~mag. At about 50~d after maximum light, SN~2017ati exhibits a decline rate close to that expected from the $^{56}$Co $\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe radioactive decay, at 0.98 mag per 100 days, as usually observed in SNe IIb. However, it remains systematically brighter at late times by about 1--2~mag, exceeding the usual upper luminosity range of this class. As a result, modelling the light curve of SN~2017ati with a standard $^{56}$Ni decay scenario requires a large nickel mass of up to $\sim0.37\,M\_{\odot}$ and still fails to reproduce the early-time light curve adequately. In contrast, incorporating additional energy input from a magnetar yields a significantly improved fit to the light curve of SN~2017ati, which would reduce the nickel mass to $\sim0.21\,M\_{\odot}$, still close to the upper end of the range typically inferred for SNe~IIb. Comparing the fitted results of SN~2017ati with the known sample of SNe~IIb indicates that its luminosity evolution is best explained by a combination of neutron star spin-down energy and radioactive nickel deposition. From late-time nebular spectra of SN~2017ati, the luminosity of the [\Oi]~$λ\lambda6300,6364$ doublet implies an oxygen mass of $\sim1.82-3.34\,M\_{\odot}$, and the combination of a [\Caii]/[\Oi] flux ratio of $\sim0.5$ with nebular spectral model comparisons favours a progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass of $\geq17\,M\_{\odot}$.

2026-02-04, **From Main Sequence Binary to Blast: MESA Modeling of the Double-Detonation Progenitor PTF1~J2238+7430**, Mercedes S. Hernandez et.al., [2602.04421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04421v1)

 Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars in close binaries with white dwarf (WD) companions are potential progenitors of double-detonation thermonuclear supernovae. The recently discovered system PTF1 J2238+7430 is a candidate for this evolutionary channel, hosting a low-mass sdB and a comparatively massive WD in a compact orbit. We aim to reproduce the evolutionary history of PTF1 J2238+7430, in which the sdB forms first via stable mass transfer, followed by the formation of the WD through a subsequent common-envelope (CE) phase. Additionally, we seek to constrain the range of initial binary parameters that can lead to such double-detonation progenitors. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we performed detailed binary evolution simulations from the zero-age main sequence to the present-day configuration. We explored initial stellar masses, orbital periods, and mass-loss fractions, including the effects of angular momentum transfer, tidal synchronization, and gravitational-wave-driven orbital evolution. The post-CE binary properties were derived using the standard energy formalism. Our models successfully reproduce the observed properties of PTF1 J2238+7430, consisting of a 0.406 solar-mass sdB and a 0.72 solar-mass WD in a 76.34-minute orbit. Stable Roche-lobe overflow of an approximately 2.7 solar-mass donor produces the sdB, while the WD forms from the initially less massive companion during an episode of CE evolution. We find that the CE ejection efficiency must be high to match the observed orbit, exceeding canonical values for similar systems. We further delineate the allowed parameter space for initial binaries that can evolve into sdB+WD systems consistent with double-detonation progenitors. These limits are preliminary; a systematic exploration of all parameters is needed for robust constraints, but our results provide a useful starting point for future work.

2026-02-04, **Stellar Interpretation of Meteoritic Data and PLotting for Everyone (SIMPLE): Isotope Mixing Lines for Six Sets of Core-Collapse Supernova Models**, Marco Pignatari et.al., [2602.04354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04354v1)

 Bulk meteorites and their inclusions exhibit, for many chemical elements, isotopic variability produced by nucleosynthetic events in stars and supernovae before the formation of the Sun. While the exact astrophysical origins of these variations are still a matter of debate, their identification provides insights on the environment of the Sun's birth and the formation of the Solar System. Here we present a new Python tool called SIMPLE (Stellar Interpretation of Meteoritic Data and Plotting for Everyone) designed to compare the isotopic composition of the ejecta from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with meteoritic data. In the present version, the SIMPLE toolkit includes a dataset of 18 CCSN models, from 6 different published sets, with initial masses of 15, 20, and 25 M$\_{\odot}$ and solar metallicity. SIMPLE is designed to easily extract the isotopic abundances predicted by each CCSN model for any elements and post-process them into the format needed to compare to the meteoritic data, therefore, facilitating their interpretation. As an example of how to use SIMPLE, we analyze the composition of the Ni isotopes in the 18 models and confirm that bulk meteorite Ni anomalies are compatible with material from the innermost Si-rich region of CCSN ejecta. Designed as a collaborative platform, SIMPLE is open-source and welcomes community contributions to enhance its development and dissemination for stellar nucleosynthesis and meteoritic studies. Future enhancements include addition of more model predictions and inclusion of mixing between different layers of supernova ejecta.

 Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) exhibit a significant diversity in their explosion properties, yet the physical mechanisms driving this diversity remain unknown. In this work, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024abfl, a SN IIP in NGC 2146 with a directly detected red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. We find it has a low plateau luminosity ($M\_V \sim -15$ mag) and a relatively long plateau length ($\sim 126.5$ days). By fitting a semi-analytical model, we estimated a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim 0.009 M\_\odot$, an initial kinetic energy of $\sim 0.42$ foe, an initial thermal energy of $\sim 0.03$ foe and an ejecta mass of $\sim 8.3 M\_\odot$. The spectral evolution of SN 2024abfl is similar to those of other SNe IIP, except for much lower ejecta velocities at similar epochs. At later epochs, we find a relatively high-velocity H$α$ absorption feature at $\sim -4000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly due to a fast-moving plume of matter in the inner ejecta, and two emission features at $\pm 2000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly caused by CSM interaction. We estimate the progenitor mass to be $\le 15 M\_\odot$ based on nebular spectra. We conclude that SN 2024abfl is a low-luminosity SN IIP originating from a low-mass RSG progenitor.

2026-02-03, **The local void model for the Hubble and BAO tensions**, Indranil Banik et.al., [2602.03928v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03928v1)

 The inconsistency between the locally inferred Hubble constant and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming the $Λ$CDM cosmological model has persisted, turning into an important problem. An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z < 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H\_0^\mathrm{CMB}$, the $Λ$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H\_0 = H\_0^\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($α\_{\mathrm{iso}} < 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H\_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions.

2026-02-03, **Light-Curve and Spectral Properties of Type II Supernovae from the ATLAS survey**, K. Ertini et.al., [2602.03638v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03638v1)

 Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most common terminal stellar explosions in the Universe. With SNe now being detected within days after explosion, there is growing evidence that the majority of Type II SNe show signs of interaction with a confined, dense cirumstellar material (CSM) in the first few days post explosion. In this work we aim to bridge the gap between single SN studies showing early-time interaction in their spectra, and the statistical studies of early-time SN light curves, which imply the existence of CSM. We present a sample of 68 Type II SNe with both early photometric data, obtained with the ATLAS survey, and spectroscopic data, obtained with the ePESSTO+ collaboration. A subset of the sample is classified based on the presence or absence of narrow spectral features with electron-scattered broadened wings in the early spectra, indicative of interaction with CSM. We characterise the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the sample by measuring rise times to maximum light, peak magnitudes, decline rates and line velocities. Additionally, we measure the ratio of absorption to emission (a/e) of the H alpha P-Cygni profile. Our analysis reveals that SNe II showing early spectroscopic signs of interaction with CSM decline faster and are brighter than those without. However no difference is found in rise times between the two groups. A clear separation is observed in the a/e ratio: SNe with signs of interaction exhibit lower a/e ratios at all epochs compared to those without. Our results highlight that understanding SN II ejecta-CSM interaction requires large, uniform samples of photometric and spectroscopic data, such as the one presented in this work.

 Narrow interstellar absorption features in supernova (SN) spectra serve as valuable diagnostics for probing dust extinction and the presence of circumstellar or interstellar material. In this third paper in a series, we investigate how the strength of narrow interstellar absorption lines in low-resolution spectra varies with SN type and host galaxy properties, both on local and global scales. Using a dataset of over 10000 spectra from $\sim1800$ low-redshift SNe, we find that Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in passive galaxies exhibit significantly weaker narrow absorption features compared to CC-SNe and SNe Ia in star-forming hosts (SNe Ia-SF), suggesting lower interstellar gas content in quiescent environments. Within the star-forming hosts, the Na I D equivalent-width distribution of SNe II is much lower than that of both SNe Ia-SF and stripped-envelope SNe (SE-SNe). This result is somewhat unexpected, since CC-SNe are generally associated with star-forming regions and occur deeper within galactic disks, where stronger line-of-sight extinction would be anticipated. This suggests that the observed behaviour cannot be explained solely by absorption from the integrated interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight. Instead, if part of the absorption arises from material near the explosion, the similarity between the Na I D EW distributions of SNe Ia-SF and SE-SNe implies that comparable absorption signatures can emerge from distinct progenitor pathways. Possible explanations include (a) circumstellar material (CSM) expelled by the progenitor system before explosion, or (b) interaction of SN radiation with nearby patchy ISM clouds. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of interstellar absorption features in revealing the diverse environments and progenitor pathways of SNe.

2026-02-03, **Shells and bubbles around compact clusters of massive stars: 3D MHD simulations**, D. V. Badmaev et.al., [2602.03502v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03502v1)

 We present the results of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) simulations of the plasma flow structure in the vicinity of a compact cluster of young massive stars. The cluster is considered at the evolutionary stage dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars. This stage occurs in clusters with ages of several million years, close to the onset of supernova explosions; the well-known objects Westerlund 1 and 2 are the prototypes. The collisions of powerful winds from massive stars in the cluster core, calculated as interactions of individual outflows, are accompanied by their partial thermalization and produce a collective cluster wind. The MHD dynamics of the cluster wind bubble expansion into the interstellar medium is considered, depending on the density of the surrounding medium with a uniform magnetic field. We show that when expanding into a cold neutral medium, the cluster wind is able to reshape its surrounding environment over the Wolf-Rayet star lifetime, sweeping up more than $10^4$ $M\_{\odot}$ of gas in $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ yr and producing extended, thin and dense shells with an amplified magnetic field. In a cold neutral medium with a density of $\sim 20$ cm$^{-3}$ and a magnetic field of $\sim 3.5$ $μ$G, a thin shell forms around the cluster wind bubble, characterized by a cellular structure in its density and magnetic field distributions. The cellular magnetic field structure appears in parts of the shell expanding transversely to the orientation of the external magnetic field. Magnetic fields in the shell are amplified to strengths $\gtrsim 50$ $μ$G. The formation of the cellular structure is associated with the development of instabilities. The expansion of the bubble into a warm neutral interstellar medium also leads to the formation of a shell with an amplified magnetic field.

2026-02-03, **SN 2024igg: A Super-Chandrasekhar/03fg-like SN exhibiting C II-dominated spectra after explosion**, Jialian Liu et.al., [2602.03427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03427v1)

 We present and analyze photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2024igg, another ``super-Chandrasekhar'' (or 03fg-like) SN whose strong C II $\lambda6580$ feature was initially misidentified as H$α$, thereby constraining its progenitor system, explosion parameters, and physical scenario. SN 2024igg shows many characteristics in common with other 03fg-like objects, such as high ultraviolet flux, slowly declining light curves ($Δm\_{15}(B)=0.90\pm0.08$ mag), low expansion velocities, along with strong and persistent C II absorption. Meanwhile, this SN exhibits some remarkable properties within this subgroup, including a moderately low optical luminosity ($M\_{\rm max}(B)=-18.99\pm0.15$ mag), a short rise time less than 18.5 days, and strong C II $\lambda6580$. The bolometric analysis yields a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M\_{\rm Ni}=0.547\pm0.082$ $M\_{\rm \odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $1.54^{+0.22}\_{-0.19}$ $M\_{\rm \odot}$, marginally exceeding the Chandrasekhar mass. Our TARDIS result indicates that most of the features in the earliest spectrum could be attributed to C II, which is consistent with a model where a supernova explodes within a carbon-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). The CSM interaction would produce a density peak in the ejecta, offering a natural explanation for the slowly evolving line velocities near $-$8000 km s$^{-1}$. The CSM may stem from the debris of a secondary white dwarf in a white-dwarf merger or the envelope of an asymptotic giant branch star. Combined with the unshifted forbidden lines in the spectrum taken at $t\approx\ +$135 days, we suggest that SN 2024igg comes from a symmetric explosion on a secular timescale after the merger.

2026-02-03, **Emulating galaxy and peculiar velocity clustering on non-linear scales**, T. Dumerchat et.al., [2602.03382v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03382v1)

 We explore the potential of cross-correlating galaxies and peculiar velocities on non-linear scales to enhance cosmological constraints. Leveraging the \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite and the halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism, we train emulator models to describe the non-linear clustering of galaxies and velocities in redshift space. Our analysis demonstrates that combining galaxy and peculiar velocity clustering, provides tighter constraints on both HOD and cosmological parameters, particularly on $σ\_8$ and $w\_0$. We further apply our models to realistic mock catalogues, reproducing the expected density and peculiar velocity errors of type-Ia supernovae and Tully-Fisher/fundamental plane measurements for the combined ZTF and DESI measurements. While systematic biases arise in the HOD parameters, the cosmological constraints remain unbiased, yielding $3.8\%$ precision measurement on $fσ\_8$ compared to $4.7\%$ using galaxy clustering alone. We demonstrate that, while combining tracers with realistic velocity measurements still yields improvement, the gains are diminished, highlighting the need for further efforts to reduce velocity measurement uncertainties and correct observational systematics on small scales.

2026-02-03, **Evidence for a 3.0$σ$ Deviation in Gravitational Light Deflection from General Relativity at Cosmological Scales with KiDS-Legacy and CMB Lensing**, Guo-Hong Du et.al., [2602.03110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03110v1)

 General Relativity (GR) faces challenges from cosmic acceleration and observational tensions, necessitating stringent tests at cosmological scales. In this work, we probe GR deviations via a $μ$-$Σ$ modified gravity parameterization, integrating KiDS-Legacy weak lensing (1347 deg$^2$, $z\leq 2.0$), joint CMB data (Planck/ACT/SPT), DESI DR2 BAO, and DES-Dovekie supernovae. KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $μ\_0$ (matter clustering) by $\sim 43\%$ and $Σ\_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\sim 60\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $Λ$CDM background, $μ\_0 = 0.21\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $Σ\_0 = 0.149\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$σ$ level -- attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT. This precise separation of GR-consistent matter clustering and deviant light deflection provides key observational clues for new physics or data systematics. Our work underscores the critical role of synergizing high-precision CMB and WL data in advancing GR tests.

2026-02-03, **Thurston geometries and parameter constraints from SNIa data**, Tanay Gupta et.al., [2602.02936v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02936v2)

 Following the numerous evidence for large-scale cosmic isotropy violation with the advent of the `precision cosmology' era, we explore the possible advantages of extending the flat $Λ$CDM model to more general models in order to constrain anisotropies in the universe, otherwise absent in the standard model based on FLRW spacetime. Such extensions are offered by the topologically unique Thurston geometries, which are homogeneous but anisotropic spacetime models. In this work, we attempt to distinguish Thurston geometries from one another by introducing anisotropies via different scale factors in different directions, thereby introducing additional model parameters such as shear, eccentricity, curvature, and a preferred axis. We used the latest compilation of Pantheon+ \& SH0ES Type Ia supernova data for deriving model constraints, and found mild evidence of large-scale isotropy violation.
