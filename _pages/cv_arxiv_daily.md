2024-01-04, **Sono\textcolor{red}{neutrino}escence: Neutrinos from Ringing Bubble of Sonoluminescence**, Rajesh Karmakar et.al., [2401.02405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02405v1)

 Time dependent gravitational background is well known as a theoretical laboratory for quantum mechanical particle production. In this submission, we explore such production in a time dependent analog system. This is the follow up of our earlier study on the Sonoluminescence phenomenon which is modelled in terms of analog geometry coupled with the electromagnetic field exhibiting quantum production. In the same analog geometry, we studied neutrino production. Like the photons, we showed that such a system can also produce a repeated flux of neutrinos via the parametric resonance from a quantum vacuum. Our analysis seems to suggest that in the laboratory setup time dependent analog systems could be an interesting playground where phenomena of quantum mechanical particle production can be observed.

2024-01-04, **A model of pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter with two complex scalars**, Tomohiro Abe et.al., [2401.02397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02397v1)

 Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNG) dark matter (DM) is a promising DM candidate and able to explain the measured DM abundance by the thermal freeze-out mechanism evading the stringent bound from DM direct detection experiments. We propose a new model providing a pNG DM by introducing two Standard-Model-singlet complex scalars with the same charges of a dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. They are also charged under a $U(1)$ global symmetry corresponding to their relative phase rotations, which is explicitly broken by a soft-breaking term in the scalar potential. The both $U(1)$ symmetries are spontaneously broken by their vacuum expectation values, giving rise to one real pNG boson. We also introduce a discrete $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ symmetry exchanging the two scalars to stabilize the pNG boson as DM. It is shown that this model reproduces the DM abundance consistently with the current bound from the direct detection experiments. The model has a gauge kinetic mixing between the dark and $U(1)\_Y$ gauge fields, which allows the dark gauge boson to decay even with a relatively light mass and prevents it from being an additional DM component. The Landau pole is avoided thanks to the small gauge coupling constant. In addition, a DM pair dominantly annihilates into a pair of the dark gauge bosons if the gauge boson mass is lighter than the DM mass, and thus its cross section has significantly different parameter dependence from other pNG DM models. We also calculate the DM-nucleon scattering cross section at the loop level. It turns out that it is necessary to probe region covered by the neutrino fog in order to test this model.

2024-01-04, **Non-standard neutrino interactions mediated by a light scalar at DUNE**, Bhaskar Dutta et.al., [2401.02107v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02107v1)

 We investigate the effect on neutrino oscillations generated by beyond-the-standard-model interactions between neutrinos and matter. Specifically, we focus on scalar-mediated non-standard interactions (NSI) whose impact fundamentally differs from that of vector-mediated NSI. Scalar NSI contribute as corrections to the neutrino mass matrix rather than the matter potential and thereby predict distinct phenomenology from the vector-mediated ones. Similar to vector-type NSI, the presence of scalar-mediated neutrino NSI can influence measurements of oscillation parameters in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, with a notable impact on CP measurement in the case of DUNE. Our study focuses on the effect of scalar NSI on neutrino oscillations, using DUNE as an example. We introduce a model-independent parameterization procedure that enables the examination of the impact of all non-zero scalar NSI parameters simultaneously. Subsequently, we convert DUNE's sensitivity to the NSI parameters into projected sensitivity concerning the parameters of a light scalar model. We compare these results with existing non-oscillation probes. Our findings reveal that the region of the light scalar parameter space sensitive to DUNE is predominantly excluded by non-oscillation probes, except for scenarios with very light mediator mass.

2024-01-04, **SPT Clusters with DES and HST Weak Lensing. II. Cosmological Constraints from the Abundance of Massive Halos**, S. Bocquet et.al., [2401.02075v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02075v1)

 We present cosmological constraints from the abundance of galaxy clusters selected via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in South Pole Telescope (SPT) data with a simultaneous mass calibration using weak gravitational lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The cluster sample is constructed from the combined SPT-SZ, SPTpol ECS, and SPTpol 500d surveys, and comprises 1,005 confirmed clusters in the redshift range $0.25-1.78$ over a total sky area of 5,200 deg$^2$. We use DES Year 3 weak-lensing data for 688 clusters with redshifts $z<0.95$ and HST weak-lensing data for 39 clusters with $0.6<z<1.7$. The weak-lensing measurements enable robust mass measurements of sample clusters and allow us to empirically constrain the SZ observable--mass relation. For a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and marginalizing over the sum of massive neutrinos, we measure $\Omega\_\mathrm{m}=0.286\pm0.032$, $\sigma\_8=0.817\pm0.026$, and the parameter combination $\sigma\_8\,(\Omega\_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.25}=0.805\pm0.016$. Our measurement of $S\_8\equiv\sigma\_8\,\sqrt{\Omega\_\mathrm{m}/0.3}=0.795\pm0.029$ and the constraint from Planck CMB anisotropies (2018 TT,TE,EE+lowE) differ by $1.1\sigma$. In combination with that Planck dataset, we place a 95% upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m\_\nu<0.18$ eV. When additionally allowing the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ to vary, we obtain $w=-1.45\pm0.31$ from our cluster-based analysis. In combination with Planck data, we measure $w=-1.34^{+0.22}\_{-0.15}$, or a $2.2\sigma$ difference with a cosmological constant. We use the cluster abundance to measure $\sigma\_8$ in five redshift bins between 0.25 and 1.8, and we find the results to be consistent with structure growth as predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model fit to Planck primary CMB data.

2024-01-04, **Windows on the Universe: Establishing the Infrastructure for a Collaborative Multi-messenger Ecosystem**, The 2023 Windows on the Universe Workshop White Paper Working Group et.al., [2401.02063v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02063v1)

 In this White Paper, we present recommendations for the scientific community and funding agencies to foster the infrastructure for a collaborative multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy (MMA/TDA) ecosystem. MMA/TDA is poised for breakthrough discoveries in the coming decade. In much the same way that expanding beyond the optical bandpass revealed entirely new and unexpected discoveries, cosmic messengers beyond light (i.e., gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays) open entirely new windows to answer some of the most fundamental questions in (astro)physics: heavy element synthesis, equation of state of dense matter, particle acceleration, etc. This field was prioritized as a frontier scientific pursuit in the 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics via its "New Windows on the Dynamic Universe" theme. MMA/TDA science presents technical challenges distinct from those experienced in other disciplines. Successful observations require coordination across myriad boundaries -- different cosmic messengers, ground vs. space, international borders, etc. -- all for sources that may not be well localized, and whose brightness may be changing rapidly with time. Add that all of this work is undertaken by real human beings, with distinct backgrounds, experiences, cultures, and expectations, that often conflict. To address these challenges and help MMA/TDA realize its full scientific potential in the coming decade (and beyond), the second in a series of community workshops sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA titled "Windows on the Universe: Establishing the Infrastructure for a Collaborative Multi-Messenger Ecosystem" was held on October 16-18, 2023 in Tucson, AZ. Here we present the primary recommendations from this workshop focused on three key topics -- hardware, software, and people and policy. [abridged]

2024-01-04, **asimulation: Domain formation and impact on observables in resolved cosmological simulations of the (a)symmetron**, Ã˜yvind Christiansen et.al., [2401.02410v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02410v1)

 The symmetron is a dark energy and dark matter candidate that forms topological defects in the late-time universe and holds promise to resolve some of the cosmological tensions. We perform high resolution simulations of the dynamical and non-linear (a)symmetron using the recently developed relativistic N-body code asevolution. By extensively testing the temporal and spatial convergence of domain decompositioning and domain wall stability, we find criteria and physical intuition for the convergence. We apply the resolution criteria to run five high resolution, $1280^3$ grids and 500 Mpc/h boxsize, simulations of the (a)symmetron and consider the behaviour of the scalar field and the domain walls in each scenario. We find the effect on the matter power spectra, the halo mass function and observables computed over the past lightcone of an observer such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and non-linear Rees-Sciama effect (ISW-RS) and the lensing, compared to LCDM. We show local oscillations of the fifth force strength and the formation of planar structures in the density field. The dynamics of the field is visualised in animations with high resolution in time. The simulation code is made publicly available.

2024-01-04, **Gravitational waves from dark domain walls**, Ã˜yvind Christiansen et.al., [2401.02409v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02409v1)

 For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.

2024-01-04, **Deflection angle and shadow of slowly rotating black holes in galactic nuclei**, A. El Balali et.al., [2401.02341v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02341v1)

 In this paper, we construct the slowly rotating case of an asymptotically flat supermassive black hole embedded in dark matter using Newman-Janis procedure. Our analysis is carried with respect to the involved parameters including the halo total mass $M$ and the galaxy's lengthscale $a\_0$. Concretly, we investigate the dark matter impact on the effective potential and the photon sphere. In particular, we find that the lengthscale $a\_0$ controles such potential values. Indeed, for low $a\_0$ values, we find that the halo total mass $M$ decreases the potential values significantly while for high $a\_0$ values such impact is diluted. Regarding the shadow aspects, we show that the shadow size is much smaller for high values of $a\_0$ while the opposite effect is observed when the halo total mass $M$ is increased. By comparing our case to the slowly rotating case, we notice that the former exhibits a shadow shifted from its center to the left side. Finally, we compute the deflection angle in the weak-limit approximation and inspect the dark matter parameters influence. By ploting such quantity, we observe that one should expect lower bending angle values for black holes in galactic nuclei.

2024-01-04, **Properties of Voids and Void Galaxies in the TNG300 Simulation**, Olivia Curtis et.al., [2401.02322v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02322v1)

 We investigate the properties of voids and void galaxies in the \texttt{TNG300} simulation. Using a luminous galaxy catalog and a spherical void finding algorithm, we identify 5,078 voids at redshift $z = 0$. Within the voids, mass does not directly trace light. Instead, the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the locations of void galaxies is systematically lower than the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the dark matter (i.e., the voids are more ``devoid'' of galaxies than they are of mass). Within the voids, the integrated underdensity profiles of the dark matter and the galaxies are independent of the local background density (i.e., voids-in-voids vs.\ voids-in-clouds). Beyond the void radii, however, the integrated underdensity profiles of both the dark matter and the galaxies exhibit strong dependencies on the local background density. Compared to non-void galaxies, void galaxies are on average younger, less massive, bluer in color, less metal enriched, and have smaller radii. In addition, the specific star formation rates of void galaxies are $\sim 20$\% higher than non-void galaxies and, in the case of galaxies with central supermassive black holes with $M\_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 3\times 10^6 h^{-1} M\_\odot$, the fraction of active void galaxies is $\sim 25$\% higher than active non-void galaxies.

2024-01-04, **Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone Boson DM with Linear Symmetry Breaking: Revisited**, Jongkuk Kim et.al., [2401.02243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02243v1)

 In this work, we revisit pseudo Nambu Goldstone boson (pNGB) DM model where global $U(1)$ dark symmetry is spontaneously broken as well as explicitly with broken by with linear symmetry breaking, focusing on the dark matter mass range in $500 {\rm GeV} \lesssim m\_{\rm DM} \lesssim O(10)$ TeV. This model is interesting not only in its own in the context of pNGB DM, but also in the context of cosmological collider signatures from heavy particle mass regime without Boltzmann suppressions, $H \lesssim m\_{\rm heavy} \lesssim 60 H$, through the chemical potential type interaction. After imposing perturbative unitarity, perturbativity, correct thermal relic density and constraints from colliders and (in)direct detection experiments, we find that pNGB DM mass is allowed up to $\sim 1 (10)$ TeV for the dark Higgs mass $m\_{H\_2} = 1 (100)$ TeV for the Higgs-dark Higgs mixing $\sin \theta = 0.1$. We also consider the case where global $U(1)$ dark symmetry is not spontaneously broken, where DM is no longer pNGB. In this case, DM and dark Higgs masses are nearly degenerate in the range of a few TeV $\lesssim m\_{{\rm DM}, H\_2} \lesssim \sim 70$ TeV. Low mass region for pNGB DM and $H\_2$ could be directly probed in colliders or indirect DM detections, whereas the heavy mass regime could be probed through the non-Gaussianity at the level of $f\_{\rm NL} \sim O(0.01-10)$ if $H$ is as low as $O(1-10)$ TeV.

2024-01-04, **Gravitational lensing from clusters of galaxies to test Disformal Couplings Theories**, Saboura Zamani et.al., [2401.02221v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02221v1)

 In this study, we investigate the potential existence of a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity using a compilation of galaxy clusters. We focus on the disformal scenario of a non-minimal model with an associated coupling length $L$. Within the Newtonian approximation, this model introduces a modification to the Poisson equation, characterized by a term proportional to $L^2 \nabla^2 \rho$, where $\rho$ represents the density of the DM field. We have tested the model by examining strong and weak gravitational lensing data available for a selection of 19 high-mass galaxy clusters observed by the CLASH survey. We have employed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to explore the parameter space, and two different statistical approaches to analyse our results: a standard marginalisation and a profile distribution method. Notably, the profile distribution analysis helps out to bypass some volume-effects in the posterior distribution, and reveals lower Navarro--Frenk--White concentrations and masses in the non-minimal coupling model compared to general relativity case. We also found a nearly perfect correlation between the coupling constant $L$ and the standard Navarro--Frenk--White scale parameter $r\_s$, hinting at a compelling link between these two lengths.

2024-01-04, **Dark Matter Influence on Quarkyonic Stars: A Relativistic Mean Field Analysis**, D. Dey et.al., [2401.02190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02190v1)

 The formulation of quarkyonic matter consists of treating both quarks and nucleons as quasi-particles, where a cross-over transition occurs between the two phases. This work is based upon some of the early ideas of quark matter. It can satisfy the different observational constraints on the neutron star (NS), such as its maximum mass and the canonical radius. In addition, we put an extra component inside the NS known as Dark Matter (DM) because it is trapped due to its immense gravitational potential. In this work, we explore the impact of fermionic DM on the structure of the NS. The equation of state (EOS) is derived for the NS with the quarkyonic matter by assuming that nucleons and quarks are in equilibrium, followed by the relativistic mean-field (RMF) formalism. The recently modeled two parameterizations, such as G3 and IOPB-I, are taken to calculate the various macroscopic properties of the NS. The three unknown parameters such as the transition density ($n\_t$), the QCD confinement scale ($\Lambda\_{\rm sc}$), and the DM Fermi momentum ($k\_f^{\rm DM}$) are varied to obtain the NS properties. The quarkyonic matter stiffens the EOS while DM softens it. The mutual combination provides us with good theoretical predictions for the magnitude of macroscopic properties consistent with the different observational results. Also, one can estimate the parameters of the DM admixed quarkyonic star with different statistical analyses, which can be further used to explore the other properties of the quarkyonic star.

2024-01-04, **Formation of collisional ring galaxies in Milgromian dynamics**, Li Ma et.al., [2401.02025v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02025v1)

 Ring galaxies are rare in the Universe. A head-on or off-centre collision between an intruder galaxy and a disc galaxy leads to a collisional ring galaxy (CRG) when the intruder-to-target mass ratio (ITMR) is over 0.1 in Newtonian dynamics. Within the framework of Milgromian dynamics, the strong equivalence principle is violated due to the presence of an external field. When two galaxies collide towards each other, the dynamical mass of the phantom dark halo in a galaxy is suppressed by the external field induced by the other galaxy. As a consequence of such suppression, the gravitational perturbation for the target galaxy introduced by a collision is weakened. In this case, a minor collision may not be capable of generating a CRG. In this work, we address this issue and perform a series of numerical simulations of collisions by tuning the values of ITMR. We find that the critical ITMR is 0.5 in MOND, which is much larger than that in Newtonian dynamics. The observed massive ring galaxies, such as Arp 147, can be effectively interpreted by CRGs in MOND. This interpretation does not necessitate the presence of dark matter halos for either the target or intruder galaxies. Moreover, for a larger inclination angle or a larger impact parameter, the off-centred ring structure is fainter. The larger critical ITMR indicates that it is harder to form a CRG in Milgrom's Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). To account for the observed ring structures of the NGC 922-like galaxies in MOND, it is necessary to invoke other scenarios than a dry minor collision.

2024-01-04, **The Implications of 'Oumuamua on Panspermia**, David Cao et.al., [2401.02390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02390v1)

 Panspermia is the hypothesis that life originated on Earth from the bombardment of foreign interstellar ejecta harboring polyextremophile microorganisms. Since the 2017 discovery of the comet-like body 'Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1) by the Pans-STARRS telescope, various studies have re-examined panspermia based on updated number density models that accommodate for 'Oumuamua's properties. By utilizing 'Oumuamua's properties as an anchor, we estimate the mass and number density of ejecta in the ISM (rho\_m [kg au^-3] and rho\_n [au^-3]). We build upon prior work by first accounting for the minimum ejecta size to shield microbes from supernova radiation. Second, we estimate the total number of impact events C\_n on Earth after its formation and prior to the emergence of life (~0.8Gyr). We derive a conditional probability relation for the likelihood of panspermia for Earth specifically of <10^-5, given a number of factors including f\_B, the fraction of ejecta harboring extremophiles and other factors that are poorly constrained. However, we find that panspermia is a plausible potential life-seeding mechanism for (optimistically) up to ~10^5 of the ~10^9 Earth-sized habitable zone worlds in our Galaxy.

2024-01-04, **Bright Supernova Precursors by Outbursts from Massive Stars with Compact Object Companions**, Daichi Tsuna et.al., [2401.02389v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02389v1)

 A fraction of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar matter are preceded by bright precursor emission. While the precursors are likely caused by a mass ejection before core-collapse, their mechanism to power energetic bursts, sometimes reaching $10^{48}$--$10^{49}\ {\rm erg}$ that are larger than the binding energies of red supergiant envelopes, is still under debate. Remarkably, such a huge energy-deposition should result in an almost complete envelope ejection and hence a strong sign of interaction, but the observed SNe with precursors show in fact typical properties among the interacting SNe. More generally, the observed luminosity of $10^{40-42}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ is shown to be challenging for a single SN progenitor. To resolve these tensions, we propose a scenario where the progenitor is in a binary system with a compact object (CO), and an outburst from the star leads to a super-Eddington accretion onto the CO. We show that for sufficiently short separations, outbursts with moderate initial kinetic energies of $10^{46}$--$10^{47}$ erg can be energized by the accreting CO so that their radiative output can be consistent with the observed precursors. We discuss the implications of our model in relation to CO binaries detectable with Gaia and gravitational wave detectors.
