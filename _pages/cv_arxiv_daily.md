2024-03-06, **Cosmological forecasts from the combination of Stage-IV photometric galaxy surveys and the magnification from forthcoming GW observatories**, Matteo Beltrame et.al., [2403.03859v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03859v1)

 In this work we have investigated the synergy between Stage-IV galaxy surveys and future GW observatories for constraining the underlying cosmological model of the Universe, focussing on photometric galaxy clustering, cosmic shear and GW magnification as cosmological probes. We have implemented a Fisher matrix approach for the evaluation of the full $6\times2$pt statistics composed by the angular power spectra of the single probes together with their combination. For our analysis, we have in particular considered dynamical dark energy and massive neutrino scenarios. We have found that the improvement to galaxy survey performance is below 1\%, in the case $\ell^{\rm GW}\_{\rm max}=100$ and a luminosity distance error of $\sigma\_{d\_L}/d\_L=10\%$. However, when extending the analysis to $\ell^{\rm GW}\_{\rm max}=1000$, we find that the GW magnification improves the galaxy survey performance on all the cosmological parameters, reducing their errors by $3\%$-$5\%$, when $\sigma\_{d\_L}/d\_L=10\%$, and by $10\%$-$18\%$ when $\sigma\_{d\_L}/d\_L=1\%$, especially for $M\_\nu$, $w\_0$ and $w\_a$. However, here our analysis is unavoidably optimistic: a much more detailed and realistic approach will be needed, especially by including systematic effects. But we can conclude that, in the case of future gravitational wave observatories the inclusion of the gravitational wave magnification can improve Stage-IV galaxy surveys performance on constraining the underlying cosmological model of the Universe.

2024-03-06, **A likelihood framework for cryogenic scintillating calorimeters used in the CRESST dark matter search**, CRESST Collaboration et.al., [2403.03824v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03824v1)

 Cryogenic scintillating calorimeters are ultrasensitive particle detectors for rare event searches, particularly for the search for dark matter and the measurement of neutrino properties. These detectors are made from scintillating target crystals generating two signals for each particle interaction. The phonon (heat) signal precisely measures the deposited energy independent of the type of interacting particle. The scintillation light signal yields particle discrimination on an event-by-event basis. This paper presents a likelihood framework modeling backgrounds and a potential dark matter signal in the two-dimensional plane spanned by phonon and scintillation light energies. We apply the framework to data from CaWO$\_4$-based detectors operated in the CRESST dark matter search. For the first time, a single likelihood framework is used in CRESST to model the data and extract results on dark matter in one step by using a profile likelihood ratio test. Our framework simultaneously fits (neutron) calibration data and physics (background) data and allows combining data from multiple detectors. Although tailored to CaWO$\_4$-targets and the CRESST experiment, the framework can easily be expanded to other materials and experiments using scintillating cryogenic calorimeters for dark matter search and neutrino physics.

2024-03-06, **Two 100 TeV neutrinos coincident with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469**, Giacomo Sommani et.al., [2403.03752v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03752v1)

 In 2013, the IceCube collaboration announced the detection of a diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux. The origin of this flux is still largely unknown. The most significant individual source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 at 4.2-sigma level with a soft spectral index. To identify sources based on their counterpart, IceCube releases realtime alerts corresponding to neutrinos with a high probability of astrophysical origin. We report here the spatial coincidence of two neutrino alerts, IC220424A and IC230416A, with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 at a distance of 70 Mpc. We evaluate, a-posteriori, the chance probability of such a coincidence and discuss this source as a neutrino emitter based on its multi-wavelength properties and in comparison to NGC 1068. To calculate the chance coincidence considering neutrino emission from a specific source population, we perform a Goodness-of-Fit test with a test statistic derived from a likelihood ratio that includes the neutrino angular uncertainty and the source distance. We apply this test first to a catalog of AGN sources and second to a catalog of Seyfert galaxies only. Our a-posteriori evaluation excludes the chance coincidence of the two neutrinos with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 at 3.3-sigma level. To be compatible with non-detections of TeV neutrinos, the source would need to have a hard spectral index.

2024-03-06, **Don't forget the electrons: extending moderately-sized nuclear networks for multidimensional hydrodynamic codes**, Domingo García-Senz et.al., [2403.03743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03743v1)

 We present here an extended nuclear network, with 90 species, designed for being coupled with hydrodynamic simulations, which includes neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons, and the corresponding neutrino and anti-neutrino emission. This network is also coupled with temperature, making it extremely robust and, together with its size, unique of its kind. The inclusion of electron captures on free protons makes the network very appropriate for multidimensional studies of Type Ia supernova explosions, especially when the exploding object is a massive white dwarf.   The results obtained with the proposed medium-sized network compare fairly well, to a few percent, with those computed with the extended network WinNet (> 2000 isotopes) in scenarios reproducing the gross physical conditions of current Type Ia supernova explosion models. In those cases where the carbon and oxygen fuel ignites at high density, the high-temperature plateau typical of the nuclear statistical equilibrium regime is well defined and stable, allowing large integration time steps. We show that the inclusion of electron captures on free protons substantially improves the estimation of the electron fraction of the mixture. Therefore, the pressure is better determined than in networks where electron captures are excluded, which will ultimately lead to more reliable hydrodynamic models. Explosive combustion of helium at low density, occurring near the surface layer of a white dwarf, is also better described with the proposed network, which gives nuclear energy generation rates much closer to WinNet than typical reduced alpha networks.

2024-03-06, **Neutron radius determination of 133Cs and constraint on the weak mixing angle**, Y. Huang et.al., [2403.03566v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03566v1)

 Proton-$^{133}$Cs elastic scattering at low momentum transfer is performed using an in-ring reaction technique at the Cooler Storage Ring at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou. Recoil protons from the elastic collisions between the internal H$\_2$-gas target and the circulating $^{133}$Cs ions at 199.4 MeV/u are detected by a silicon-strip detector. The matter radius of $^{133}$Cs is deduced by describing the measured differential cross sections using the Glauber model. Employing the adopted proton distribution radius, a point-neutron radius of 4.86(21) fm for $^{133}$Cs is obtained. With the newly determined neutron radius, the weak mixing angle sin$^2 \theta\_W$ is independently extracted to be 0.227(28) by fitting the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering data. This work limits the sin$^2 \theta\_W$ value in a range smaller than the ones proposed by the previous independent approaches.

2024-03-06, **How open is the asteroid-mass primordial black hole window?**, Matthew Gorton et.al., [2403.03839v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03839v1)

 Primordial black holes (PBHs) can make up all of the dark matter (DM) if their mass, $m$, is in the so-called 'asteroid-mass window', $10^{17} \, {\rm g} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{22} \, {\rm g}$. Observational constraints on the abundance of PBHs are usually calculated assuming they all have the same mass, however this is unlikely to be a good approximation. PBHs formed from the collapse of large density perturbations during radiation domination are expected to have an extended mass function (MF), due to the effects of critical collapse. The PBH MF is often assumed to be lognormal, however it has recently been shown that other functions are a better fit to numerically calculated MFs. We recalculate both current and potential future constraints for these improved fitting functions. We find that for current constraints the asteroid-mass window narrows, but remains open (i.e. all of the DM can be in the form of PBHs) unless the PBH MF is wider than expected. Future evaporation and microlensing constraints may together exclude all of the DM being in PBHs, depending on the width of the PBH MF and also the shape of its low and high mass tails.

2024-03-06, **Impact of baryonic feedback on HSC Y1 weak lensing non-Gaussian statistics**, Daniela Grandón et.al., [2403.03807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03807v1)

 Baryonic feedback is a major systematic in weak lensing cosmology. Its most studied effect is the suppression of the lensing power spectrum, a second-order statistic, on small scales. Motivated by the growing interest in statistics beyond the second order, we investigate the effect of baryons on lensing non-Gaussian statistics and the resulting biases in the matter clustering amplitude $S\_8 = \sigma\_8\sqrt{\Omega\_m/0.3}$. We focus on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 1 (HSC-Y1) data which, with its high source number density, closely resembles those expected from the upcoming Euclid and Rubin LSST. We study four non-Gaussian statistics -- peak counts, minimum counts, the probability distribution function, and the scattering transform -- in addition to the usual power spectrum. We first estimate the biases in $S\_8$ using mock observations built from the IllustrisTNG and BAHAMAS hydrodynamical simulations and theoretical models built from dark matter-only simulations. We find up to $1\sigma$ bias in $S\_8$ when the smallest scales (2 arcmin) and the highest feedback level are considered. We then analyze the HSC-Y1 data and compare the $S\_8$ obtained for each statistic with different smoothing scales or scale cuts. As we expect that baryons mostly affect the small scales, comparing the results obtained from including and excluding small scales can indicate the level of impact from baryons. With HSC data, we find only minor ($\leq0.5\sigma$) differences in $S\_8$ for all statistics, even when considering very small scales (2 arcmin). Our results suggest that the effect of baryons is insignificant at the level of HSC-Y1 down to 2~arcmin for all statistics examined here, or it is canceled by other scale-dependent systematics.

2024-03-06, **Multimessenger signals from compact axion star mergers**, Liina Chung-Jukko et.al., [2403.03774v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03774v1)

 Axion dark matter can form stable, self-gravitating, and coherent configurations known as axion stars, which are rendered unstable above a critical mass by the Chern-Simons coupling to electromagnetism. We study, using numerical relativity, the merger and subsequent decay of compact axion stars. We show that two sub-critical stars can merge, and form a more massive, excited and critical star, which survives for a finite period before rapidly decaying via electromagnetic radiation. We find a rich multimessenger signal, composed of gravitational waves, electromagnetic radiation, and axion radiation. The gravitational wave signal is broken into two parts: a weak and broad signal from the merger, followed by a much stronger signal of almost fixed frequency from the decay. The electromagnetic radiation follows only the gravitational waves from the decay, while the axion signal is continuous throughout the process. We briefly discuss the detectability of such a signal.

2024-03-06, **Hubble tension may indicate time-dependent dark matter energy density**, Noriaki Kitazawa et.al., [2403.03484v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03484v1)

 The values of Hubble constant H0 by direct measurements with standard distance ladder are typically larger than those obtained from the observation of cosmic microwave background and the galaxy survey with inverse distance ladder. On the other hand, although the errors are still large, various determinations of the value of matter density parameter Omega\_m are consistent with each other. Therefore, it is possible that the difference in Hubble constant is translated to the difference of physical matter energy density omega\_m = Omega\_m h^2, where h = H0 / (100 Km/s/Mpc). In this article it is examined the possibility of an increase of the physical dark matter energy density by a fast transition at a certain value of redshift as a possible resolution of the Hubble tension. A phenomenological fluid model of the dark sector, which is the modification of a so-called unified dark matter model, is introduced to concretely realize such a fast transition in the physical dark matter energy density.

2024-03-06, **The ALMA-CRISTAL survey: Extended [CII] emission in an interacting galaxy system at z ~ 5.5**, A. Posses et.al., [2403.03379v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03379v1)

 The ALMA [CII] Resolved Ism in STar-forming gALaxies (CRISTAL) survey is a Cycle 8 ALMA Large Programme that studies the cold gas component of high-redshift galaxies. Its sub-arcsecond resolution observations are key to disentangling physical mechanisms that shape galaxies during cosmic dawn. In this paper, we explore the morphology and kinematics of the cold gas, star-forming, and stellar components in the star-forming main-sequence galaxy CRISTAL-05/HZ3, at z = 5.54. Our analysis includes 0.3" spatial resolution (~2 kpc) ALMA observations of the [CII] line. While CRISTAL-05 was previously classified as a single source, our observations reveal that the system is a close interacting pair surrounded by an extended component of carbon-enriched gas. This is imprinted in the disturbed elongated [CII] morphology and the separation of the two components in the position-velocity diagram (~100 km/s). The central region is composed of two components, named C05-NW and C05-SE, with the former being the dominant one. A significant fraction of the [CII] arises beyond the close pair up to 10 kpc, while the regions forming new massive stars and the stellar component seem compact (r\_[CII] ~ 4 r\_UV), as traced by rest-frame UV and optical imaging obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. Our kinematic model, using the DYSMALpy software, yields a minor contribution of dark matter of C05-NW within a radius of ~2x Reff. Finally, we explore the resolved [CII]/FIR ratios as a proxy for shock-heating produced by this merger. We argue that the extended [CII] emission is mainly caused by the merger, which could not be discerned with lower-resolution observations. Our work emphasizes the need for high-resolution observations to fully characterize the dynamic stages of infant galaxies and the physical mechanisms that drive the metal enrichment of the circumgalactic medium.
