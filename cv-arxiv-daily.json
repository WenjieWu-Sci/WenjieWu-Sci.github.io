We evaluate the next-to-leading order (NLO) long-range NMEs recently introduced within chiral effective field theory, keeping three terms in the expansion of the energy denominator. In most cases, NLO contributions to the half-life are below 5%, but they can increase to 25% due to cancellations in the leading-order Gamow-Teller NME. A detailed analysis in terms of nuclear deformation, including triaxiality, indicates that larger deformation differences between the initial and final states generally lead to smaller NMEs, but the seniority structure of the states also plays a relevant role. The lower range of our predicted half-lives, with uncertainties dominated by the nuclear Hamiltonian used, are slightly longer than the current experimental limit in $^{76}$Ge and the very recent half-life indication in $^{82}$Se.\n\n", "2507.21867": "2025-07-29, **Gamma rays as leptonic portals to energetic neutrinos: a new Monte Carlo approach**, Gaetano Di Marco et.al., [2507.21867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21867v1)\n\n High center-of-mass electromagnetic~(EM) interactions could produce decaying heavy leptons and hadrons, leading to neutrino generation. These processes might occur in the most extreme astrophysical scenarios, potentially altering the expected gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes in both the hadronic and the leptonic pictures. For instance, neutrinos could arise from high-redshift EM cascades, triggered by gamma rays beyond $10^{18} \\; \\text{eV}$ scattering background photons, from radio to ultraviolet energy bands. Such energetic gamma rays are predicted in cosmogenic models and in scenarios involving non-standard physics. On astrophysical scales, leptonic production of neutrinos could take place in active galactic nuclei cores, where several-TeV gamma rays interact with the X-ray photons from the hot corona. We explore these scenarios within the CRPropa Monte Carlo code framework, developing dedicated tools to account for leptonic production and decay of heavy leptons and hadrons. In particular, the latter are performed by interfacing with the PYTHIA event generator. With these novel tools, we characterise the spectrum and flavour composition of neutrinos emerging from cosmological EM cascades and from leptonic processes in the core of active galactic nuclei.

A heavier neutrino could decay into a lighter one and a massless scalar or pseudoscalar boson, such as the Majoron. Two-body non-radiative decay could occur in dense matter, such as in the inner dense regions of a core-collapse supernova. We first derive novel bounds on neutrino-Majoron couplings using the spectral distortions induced by neutrino non-radiative two-body decay in matter, and two-dimensional likelihood analyses of the 24 $\\bar{\\nu}\\_e$ events from SN1987A. We then explore the prospects of neutrino-Majoron couplings from a future galactic core-collapse supernova, leaving either a neutron star or a black-hole. To this aim, we use information from detailed one-dimensional supernova simulations. We consider the supernova neutrino signal associated with inverse-beta decay in the upcoming JUNO and Hyper-Kamiokande detectors, with neutrino-argon scattering in DUNE, or with coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering in the DARWIN experiment. In a full 3$\\nu$ framework, based on the spectral distortions induced by neutrino decay in matter, we perform two-dimensional likelihood analyses and provide prospects for the limits on neutrino-Majoron couplings. Our results show that the observation of a future supernova will significantly improve on the current bounds, in particular from SN1987A and neutrinoless double-beta decay. Finally, we explore the impact of neutrino decay in matter on the diffuse supernova neutrino background formed by past supernova explosions.

The absence of convincing electromagnetic counterparts motivates exploration of exotic origins beyond standard astrophysical processes.

The aforementioned final states leave a hard electromagnetic signature with no hadronic activity above the detector energy thresholds. Nevertheless, such signatures are not immune to backgrounds from neutrino scattering in the detector, which are in the focus of our study.

Here we explain how to efficiently reheat the universe after such period in the above-mentioned class of theories. Two cases are possible, depending on whether the RSB scale is much larger than the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking scale or not. When it is, the dominant reheating mechanism can be the decays of the field responsible for RSB in the Standard Model (SM) sector. We point out that in a similar way dark matter (DM) can be produced and we analyze in some detail the case of a sterile-neutrino, finding that the full DM abundance is reproduced when this particle is at the $10^2$ MeV scale in a well-motivated SM completion. When the RSB scale is not much larger than the EW symmetry breaking scale, we find that efficient reheating always occurs when the energy density of the false vacuum is first entirely transferred to a dark photon and then to SM fermions via dark-photon decays.\n\n", "2507.20754": "2025-07-28, **Charged current neutrino and antineutrino induced associated particle production from nucleons**, A.

We employ a model based on effective Lagrangians to evaluate the contributions from the nonresonant and the resonant diagrams.

To this end, we construct the semi-classical Boltzmann equation for sterile neutrinos applicable in the case of arbitrarily large lepton asymmetries, and confirm its validity by quantum kinetic equations. This way, we derive the maximal parameter space for sterile neutrino dark matter with lepton asymmetries.

Using the Jeans equation, we model the kinematics of these galaxies and perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to constrain the parameters of the NLG kernel chosen for our analysis. Our results indicate that NLG might successfully reproduce the observed kinematics of dSph galaxies without requiring particle dark matter, providing constraints on the scale-dependent modifications to gravity that are compatible with previous studies in the literature.

This can help to solve questions that cannot be answered by the SM alone, like introducing dark matter candidates or new sources of CP-violation required to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.

A key step towards its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors, which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic radioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first experimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix.

In this work, we investigate how the presence of skewed dark matter distributions outside the innermost stable circular orbit of regular black holes modifies the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects. Rather than introducing corrections directly into an effective potential, we model the influence of dark matter through metric corrections, allowing a full control over the spatial distribution and abundance of dark matter. We demonstrate that a skewed normal profile generically introduces shallow potential wells or secondary barriers in the effective potential of perturbation equations, depending sensitively on the type of perturbations: scalar, spinor, or tensor. These modifications lead to distinctive quasinormal mode features, including long-lived modes, echo effects, and in some cases, altered stability behaviors. Notably, the axial and polar sectors of tensor field perturbations respond asymmetrically to identical dark matter profiles, revealing a deeper structural distinction in their perturbation dynamics.

We perform a Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave events following all Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog data, assuming a log-normal PBH mass function. We compute the merger rate distribution of PBH binaries by accounting for gravitational torques from the surrounding PBH. To constrain this rate, we employ the latest limits from the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo.

In this work, we search for red giant members of Pal 5 using spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17 and photometric and astrometric data from Gaia DR3. Based on position and proper motion, we identify eight members of Pal 5: six in the core and two in the stream. The clustering algorithm HDBSCAN finds these same eight. We then use chemical tagging with APOGEE abundances to search for additional members across five APOGEE fields overlapping Pal 5. While several dozen candidates are identified, most deviate (some significantly) from known kinematic and color-magnitude trends, suggesting that they are less likely to be true members. We estimate the expected number of giants in the APOGEE pointings based on the area and stellar mass of the streams. Given APOGEE's limiting magnitude, we find that few, if any, new giants are expected, especially if the stream is more diffuse at these locations.

The baryonic matter (BM) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach with density-dependent couplings, while the dark sector mirrors the visible sector with analogous thermodynamic conditions. Using a two-fluid formalism with purely gravitational DM-BM interaction, we find that rotation enlarges the star, whereas DM admixture increases compactness and enhances gravitational stability. However, increased compactness due to DM lowers the threshold for rotational instabilities, making DM-admixed stars more susceptible. Rotation decreases temperature profiles by redistributing thermal energy over a larger volume and reducing central density, while DM raises temperatures by deepening the gravitational potential and increasing thermal energy. Stars become more prone to collapse and rotational instabilities as frequency ($\\nu$) rises and the polar-to-equatorial radius ratio ($r\\_p/r\\_e$) decreases, especially near the Keplerian limit ($\\nu\\_K$). DM-admixed stars also show higher surface gravitational redshifts due to their compactness. Our results qualitatively agree with universal relations primarily derived for rotating cold stars.

One of the key mechanisms by which this takes place is via a galaxy's interactions with a local, over-dense environment (satellite or environmental quenching). In the very local Universe, we see these processes in action, and can also observe their effects via the distribution of satellite galaxy properties. However, extending similar analyses outside of the local Universe is problematic, largely due to the difficulties in robustly defining environments with small and/or incomplete spectroscopic samples. We use new environmental metrics from the high-completeness Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the properties of satellite galaxies at intermediate redshift (0.3$<$z$<$0.5) and compare directly to the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0$<$z$<$0.2. Importantly, both the galaxy properties and environmental metrics in DEVILS and GAMA are derived in an identical manner, reducing any methodology biases. We find: i) that satellite galaxies in DEVILS and GAMA show suppressed star-formation in comparison to isolated systems at the same stellar mass, by $\\sim$0.5dex in log$\\_{10}$(SFR/M$\\_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), ii) that this suppression is strongest in higher mass dark matter halos (up to $\\sim$1dex in log$\\_{10}$(SFR/M$\\_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) in the most massive halos) and iii) that at fixed stellar and halo mass, this suppression increases with time - with satellite passive fractions increasing by $\\sim$10-15\\% over the last $\\sim$5Gyr.

We address this challenge using a semi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV luminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation efficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint Bayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning $z = 4 - 16$ using combined HST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift evolution only in the low-mass slope parameter $\\alpha(z)$ while maintaining other SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent agreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter $\\sigma\\_{\\rm UV} = 0.32$ dex, significantly lower than the $\\gtrsim 1.3$ dex values suggested by previous studies for $z > 13$. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated by strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with $\\alpha$ increasing toward higher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during cosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important observational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias across the full redshift range. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of $z\\sim 20$. Our results demonstrate that JWST's early galaxy observations can be reconciled with standard cosmology through the interplay of modest stochasticity and evolving star formation physics, without invoking extreme burstiness or exotic mechanisms.\n\n", "2507.20484": "2025-07-28, **Dark photon dark matter from flattened axion potentials**, Hong-Yi Zhang et.al., [2507.20484v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20484v1)\n\n Dark photons can be resonantly produced in the early universe via their coupling to an oscillating axion field. However, this mechanism typically requires large axion-dark photon couplings or some degree of fine-tuning. In this work, we present a new scenario in which efficient dark photon production arises from axion potentials that are shallower than quadratic at large field values. For moderately large initial misalignment angles, the oscillation of the axion field can trigger either efficient dark photon production or strong axion self-resonance via parametric resonance. When self-resonance dominates and disrupts the field's homogeneity, we show that oscillons -- localized, oscillating axion field configurations -- naturally form and can sustain continued dark photon production, provided the coupling is $\\gtrsim \\mathcal O(1)$. For dark photon mass up to three orders of magnitude below the axion mass, the produced dark photons can account for a significant fraction of the present-day dark matter. We support this scenario with numerical lattice simulations of a benchmark model. Our results further motivate experimental searches for ultralight dark photon dark matter.

This work investigates whether superhorizon isocurvature perturbations in cold dark matter (CDM) can account for this discrepancy. We demonstrate that, unlike adiabatic modes which cancel at leading order, superhorizon isocurvature modes can generate an intrinsic CMB dipole without significantly affecting galaxy number counts, thereby explaining the observed mismatch. We explore both single-mode and continuous-spectrum cases, focusing on two concrete models: a nearly scale-invariant power-law spectrum with a UV cutoff and axion-induced isocurvature perturbations. For the axion scenario, we show that if the radial mode evolves during inflation, the resulting perturbations can match the required amplitude while evading current CMB constraints. Our analysis constrains the self-coupling of associated potential for the axion to the range $10^{-9} < \\lambda < 4 \\times 10^{-9}$.

M. Becerra et.al., [2507.22033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22033v1)\n\n Strange quark stars (SQSs), namely compact stars entirely composed of deconfined quark matter, are characterized by similar masses and compactness to neutron stars (NSs) and have been theoretically proposed to exist in the Universe since the 1970s. However, multiwavelength observations of compact stars in the last 50 years have not yet led to an unambiguous SQS identification. This article explores whether SQSs could form in the supernova (SN) explosion of an evolved star (e.g., carbon-oxygen, or Wolf-Rayet) occurring in a binary with the companion being a neutron star (NS). The collapse of the iron core of the evolved star generates a newborn NS and the SN explosion. Part of the ejected matter accretes onto the NS companion as well as onto the newborn NS via matter fallback. The accretion occurs at hypercritical (highly super-Eddington) rates, transferring mass and angular momentum to the stars. We present numerical simulations of this scenario and demonstrate that the density increase in the NS interiors during the accretion process may induce quark matter deconfinement, suggesting the possibility of SQS formation. We discuss the astrophysical conditions under which such a transformation may occur and possible consequences.\n\n", "2507.21821": "2025-07-29, **Tidal heating in detached double white dwarf binaries**, Lucy O.

We formulate tidal heating in helium composition extremely low mass white dwarf (ELM WD) components of detached DWDBs which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass radius relation which varies with surface temperature and the tidal friction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal friction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and hence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of binaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up to $\\sim$40\\% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white dwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for the oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day. In the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer should occur at orbital periods as long as 1000s (17 minutes), or binary gravitational wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over three times longer than periods expected for degenerate WD (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs are progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations e.g. RCrB stars, AM CVn binaries, type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor white dwarfs should be taken into account.\n\n", "2507.21607": "2025-07-29, **Does DESI DR2 challenge $\u039b$CDM paradigm ?**, Himanshu Chaudhary et.al., [2507.21607v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21607v1)\n\n Although the debate about the systematic errors of DESI DR1 is still open, recent DESI DR2 is consistent with DESI DR1 and further strengthens the results of DESI DR1.

Huynh et.al., [2507.21307v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21307v1)\n\n Pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISNe) are transient events occurring in progenitor stars with helium cores of approximately 32-65 solar masses, where rapid electron-positron pair production induces pressure loss, collapse, and pulsations driving episodic mass loss. The number, strength, and duration of these pulses can lead to shell collisions that produce shock-powered transients, potentially explaining some of the most luminous events, such as superluminous supernovae, and other rare transients. Rapid progenitor rotation lowers the PPISN mass threshold and influences the dynamics, energetics, and chemical composition of PPISN-driven pulses. In this study, we computed 1D evolutionary models of massive, rotating PPISN progenitor stars with zero-age main-sequence masses of 85-140 solar masses and solar metallicity and 10% solar metallicity. Our analysis reveals strong correlations between PPISN ejected mass and total energy as well as between ejected mass and peak ejected shell velocity. Additionally, moderate correlations indicate that higher initial PPISN progenitor mass leads to greater mass ejection and energy release, while negative correlations show that rapid rotation appears to reduce mass ejection and kinetic energy of the shells. Subsequent pulses lead to hydrogen-poor, carbon- and oxygen-enriched ejected shells, indicating the effect of rotationally-induced chemical mixing in PPISN-driven episodic mass loss with implications for their transients. We model the light curve and synthetic spectra that arise from the collision of two H-poor shells for one of our models using the radiation transport code SuperLite. We find that shock-heated H-poor PPISN shell collisions from rapidly rotating progenitors can lead to moderately luminous H-poor transients that share some similarities with observed SLSN-I events.\n\n", "2507.21304": "2025-07-28, **SN2022jli modeled with a $^{56}$Ni double-layer and a magnetar**, Mariana Orellana et.al., [2507.21304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21304v1)\n\n We study the bolometric evolution of the exceptional Type Ic Supernova (SN) 2022jli, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for its distinctive double-peaked light curve morphology, extended timescales, and the rapid, steep decline in luminosity observed at around 270 days after the SN discovery.

We explore the parameter space of a model in which the SN is powered by radioactive decay assuming a bimodal nickel distribution. While this setup can reproduce the early light curve properties, it faces problems to explain the prominent second peak. We therefore consider a hybrid scenario with a rapidly rotating magnetar as additional energy source.

In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis.

Therefore, the discovery of each new object in this class offers a unique opportunity to improve our understanding about their origins and potential connection with other high-energy phenomena.

Here, we investigate the possible mechanisms powering its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities, using numerical calculations to simulate the explosion. We found that low ejecta masses (Mej ~ 2 Msun) and moderate explosion energies (E ~ 2e51 erg) are required to reproduce the data. Our models also show that a large amount of nickel (M\\_Ni = 0.85 Msun) is needed to achieve the high luminosity of SN 2025kg, which makes this scenario difficult to sustain. As an alternative, we explore a model in which a millisecond magnetar serves as the primary energy source. A magnetar with a spin period of 3 ms, approximately, and a magnetic field of 28e14 G gives an adequate match to the data. To account for the early cooling phase, we assume the presence of a dense circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor, with a mass of 0.27 Msun and an extension of 500 Rsun.
