Zhang et.al., [2408.02195v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02195v1)\n\n Alternative gravity theories have been put forward to address the limitations of general relativity, each exhibiting differences, particularly in their strong-field limits. Nonetheless, there remains a lack of effective means to distinguish or test these theories through local strong-field measurements. In this work, we define a global Gaussian bending measure over singular spacetime regions, establish a corresponding global theory, and demonstrate its applications in a general stationary spacetime. The global theory is based on differential geometry, rather than on specific gravity theories, allowing it to depict various physics within general relativity and beyond. For example, it is applicable to describe the gravitational bending of massless or massive messengers, such as photons, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and possibly massive gravitational waves predicted in certain theories of gravity. Besides, the global theory can be applied to any stationary spacetime regions outside a rotating black hole. As an instance of its direct applications, we investigate the highly-curved spacetime effects of the black hole in its immediate surrounding regions and design local strong-field experiments involving different shapes of singular lensing patches. New means can be therefore anticipated to be developed according to the global theory to differentiate between different gravity theories and test them in their strong-field regions.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2408.03276": "2024-08-06, **Minding the gap: testing natural anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking at high luminosity LHC**, Howard Baer et.al., [2408.03276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03276v1)\n\n While the minimal anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking model (mAMSB) seems ruled out by constraints on Higgs mass, naturalness and wino dark matter, a slightly generalized version dubbed natural AMSB (nAMSB) remains both viable and compelling. Like mAMSB, nAMSB features winos as the lightest gauginos, but unlike mAMSB, nAMSB allows a small mu parameter so that higgsinos are the lightest of electroweakinos (EWinos). nAMSB spectra depend on the input value of gravitino mass m\\_{3/2}, where the lower range of m\\_{3/2} is excluded by LHC gluino pair searches while a higher m\\_{3/2} band is excluded by LHC limits on wino pair production followed by boosted hadronic wino decays. A remaining intermediate gap in m\\_{3/2} values remains allowed by present LHC searches, but appears to be completely explorable by high luminosity ugrades of LHC (HL-LHC). We explore a variety of compelling discovery channels that may allow one to close the intermediate gap in m\\_{3/2} values: 1. same-sign diboson +MET (SSdB) production arising from wino pair production, leading to same-sign dileptons plus MET, 2. trilepton production arising from wino pair production and 3. soft dilepton plus jet events from higgsino pair production, 4. top-squark pair production.

This task has been exceedingly challenging, primarily due to the considerable computational time required, which stems from the substantial scale difference between galaxies (~ 0.1 Mpc) and star clusters (~ pc). Yet, this significant scale separation means that particles within star clusters perceive those outside the star cluster in a semi-stationary state. By leveraging this aspect, we integrate the direct N-body code (Nbody6++GPU) into the cosmological (magneto-)hydrodynamic code (Enzo) through the utilization of the semi-stationary background acceleration approximation. We solve the dynamics of particles within star clusters using the direct N-body solver with regularization for few-body interactions, while evolving particles outside -- dark matter, gas, and stars -- using the particle-mesh gravity solver and hydrodynamic methods. We demonstrate that Enzo-N successfully simulates the co-evolution of star clusters and their parent galaxies, capturing phenomena such as core collapse of the star cluster and tidal stripping due to galactic tides. This comprehensive framework opens up new possibilities for studying the evolution of star clusters within galaxies, offering insights that were previously inaccessible.\n\n", "2408.03036": "2024-08-06, **Modeling and measuring the anisotropic halo 3-point correlation function: a coordinated study**, Antonio Farina et.al., [2408.03036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03036v1)\n\n Ongoing spectroscopic galaxy surveys like DESI (arXiv:1611.00037, arXiv:1611.00036) and Euclid (arXiv:2405.13491) will cover unprecedented volumes with a number of objects large enough to effectively probe clustering anisotropies through higher-order statistics. In this work, we present an original and efficient implementation of both a model for the multipole moments of the anisotropic 3-point correlation function (3PCF) and for their estimator. To assess the adequacy of our model, we have predicted the anisotropic 3PCF for a set of dark matter halos at redshift $z = 1$ and compared our prediction with the 3PCF measurement obtained by applying our estimator to a suite of 298 N-body + 3000 approximate mock halo catalogs at the same redshift. The use of the anisotropic component of the 3PCF effectively breaks the degeneracy between the growth rate $f$ and the linear bias $b\\_1$, allowing us to obtain unbiased estimates for both parameters from a Euclid-like survey. A joint, full anisotropic, 2 and 3-point correlation analysis would also allow us to measure the clustering amplitude $\\sigma\\_8$ along with $f$ and $b\\_1$ with a precision of approximately 17%, and to effectively constrain all galaxy biasing parameters of the model. However, these results largely exploit information from the isotropic part of the 3PCF signal. The addition of the anisotropic multipoles tightens parameter estimates by just 5% at most. We argue that this modest improvement likely reflects the use of a simplified cosmological model with relatively few free parameters. The 3PCF anisotropic multipoles will prove useful in reducing the impact of projection effects that affect high-dimensional cosmological analyses. To support this conjecture, we provide an example in which an additional source of anisotropy, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, is added to the system.\n\n", "2408.03004": "2024-08-06, **Reconciling Cosmological Tensions with Inelastic Dark Matter and Dark Radiation in a $\\boldsymbol{U(1)_D}$ Framework**, Wonsub Cho et.al., [2408.03004v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03004v1)\n\n We propose a novel and comprehensive particle physics framework that addresses multiple cosmological tensions observed in recent measurements of the Hubble parameter, $S\\_8$, and Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest data. Our model, termed `{\\bf SIDR+$\\boldsymbol{z\\_t}$}' (Self Interacting Dark Radiation with transition redshift), is based on an inelastic dark matter (IDM) scenario coupled with dark radiation, governed by a $U(1)\\_D$ gauge symmetry. This framework naturally incorporates cold dark matter (DM), SIDR, and the interactions between these components. The fluid-like behavior of the dark radiation component, effectively mitigates both the Hubble and $S\\_8$ tensions by suppressing free-streaming effects. Simultaneously, the interacting DM-DR system attenuates the matter power spectrum at small scales, potentially reconciling discrepancies in Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Ly-$\\alpha$) observations. The inelastic nature of DM provides a distinct temperature dependence for the DM-DR interaction rate determined by the mass-splitting between the inelastic dark fermions which is crucial for resolving the Ly-$\\alpha$ discrepancies. We present a cosmologically consistent analysis of the model by solving the relevant Boltzmann equations to obtain the energy density and number density evolution of different species of the model. The DR undergoes two ``steps\" of increased energy density when the heavier dark species freeze out and become non-relativistic, transferring their entropy to the dark radiation and enhancing $\\Delta N{\\rm eff}$. The analysis showcases the model's potential to uphold the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) prediction of $\\Delta N\\_{\\rm eff}$ but dominantly producing additional contributions prior to recombination, while simultaneously achieving correct relic density of DM though an hybrid of freeze-in and non-thermal production.\n\n", "2408.02725": "2024-08-05, **Peculiar dark matter halos inferred from gravitational lensing as a manifestation of modified gravity**, Michal B\u00edlek et.al., [2408.02725v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02725v1)\n\n If modified gravity holds, but the weak lensing analysis is done in the standard way, one finds that dark matter halos have peculiar shapes, not following the standard Navarro-Frenk-White profiles, and are fully predictable from the distribution of baryons. Here we study in detail the distribution of the apparent dark matter around point masses, which approximate galaxies and galaxy clusters, and their pairs for the QUMOND MOND gravity, taking an external gravitational acceleration $g\\_e$ into account. At large radii, the apparent halo of a point mass $M$ is shifted against the direction of the external field. When averaged over all lines-of-sight, the halo has a hollow center, and denoting the by $a\\_0$ the MOND acceleration constant, its density behaves like $\\rho(r)=\\sqrt{Ma\\_0/G}/(4\\pi r^2)$ between the galacticentric radii $\\sqrt{GM/a\\_0}$ and $\\sqrt{GMa\\_0}/g\\_e$, and like $\\rho\\propto r^{-7}G^2M^3a\\_0^3/g\\_e^5$ further away. Between a pair of point masses, there is a region of a negative apparent dark matter density, whose mass can exceed the baryonic mass of the system. The density of the combined dark matter halo is not a sum of the densities of the halos of the individual points. The density has a singularity near the zero-acceleration point, but remains finite in projection. We compute maps of the surface density and the lensing shear for several configurations of the problem, and derive formulas to scale them to further configurations. In general, for a large subset of MOND theories in their weak field regime, for any configuration of the baryonic mass $M$ with the characteristic size of $d$, the total lensing density scales as $\\rho({\\vec{x}})=\\sqrt{Ma\\_0/G}d^{-2}f\\left(\\vec{\\alpha},\\vec{x}/d,g\\_ed/\\sqrt{GMa\\_0}\\right)$, where the vector $\\vec{\\alpha}$ describes the geometry of the system.

Our aim is to classify all possible ways of embedding a $U(1)$ symmetry in a three-Higgs-doublet model. The different possibilities are presented and compared. All these models contain mass-degenerate pairs of Dark Matter candidates due to a $U(1)$ symmetry unbroken (conserved) by the vacuum. Most of these models preserve CP. In the CP-conserving case the pairs can be seen as one being even and the other being odd under CP or as having opposite charges under $U(1)$. Not all symmetries presented here were identified before in the literature, which points to the fact that there are still many open questions in three-Higgs-doublet models. We also perform a numerical exploration of the $U(1) \\otimes U(1)$-symmetric 3HDM, this is the most general phase-invariant (real) three-Higgs-doublet model.

Such interactions responsible for boosting the DM also attenuate its flux at the Earth. Considering a simple model of constant interaction cross-section, we make analytical estimates of the variation of the attenuation ceiling with the DM mass and confirm it numerically. We then extend our analysis to a $Z'$-mediated leptophilic DM model. We show that the attenuation ceiling remains nearly model-independent for DM and mediator particles heavier than the electron, challenging some previous discussions on this topic. Using the XENONnT direct detection experiment, we illustrate how constraints based on energy-dependent scattering can significantly differ from those based on an assumed constant cross-section.

ALP dark matter would manifest as a nearly monochromatic field oscillating at an (as of yet) unknown frequency. The frequency depends on the ALP mass, which could plausibly range from $10^{-22}$ eV/$c^2$ to $10$ eV/$c^2$. We report on a direct search for ALP dark matter through the ALP-nucleon interaction by interfering the signals of two atomic K-Rb-$^3$He comagnetometers, with one situated in Mainz, Germany, and the other in Krak\\'ow, Poland. We use the ALP dark matter's spatiotemporal coherence properties assuming the standard halo model of dark matter in the Milky Way to improve the sensitivity and exclude spurious candidates. The search extends over nine orders of magnitude in ALP mass. In this range, no significant evidence of an ALP signal is found. We thus place new upper limits on the ALP-neutron and ALP-proton couplings of $g\\_{aNN}<10^{-5}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $g\\_{aPP}<5 \\times 10^{-4}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at a mass of $10^{-22}$ eV/$c^2$ and extending to a mass of $10^{-15}$ eV/$c^2$ where the upper limits reach below $g\\_{aNN}<10^{-9}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $g\\_{aPP}<10^{-7}$ GeV$^{-1}$, respectively.

We call it {\\it quintessential early dark energy} model in which early and late dark energy are explained by a single scalar field. In other words two different energy scales are related by a single scalar field potential. To achieve this we introduce the modified steep exponential potential. This potential has a hilltop nature during the early time which consists of a flat region followed by a steep region. This nature of the potential plays a crucial role in achieving early dark energy solution. During recent time, the potential can almost mimic the cosmological constant which can result into late time acceleration. We also constrain and compare the models for steep exponential, modified steep exponential, axionlike and power law potentials by using the available background cosmological data from CMB, BAO (including DESI DR1 2024), supernovae (Pantheon$+$, DESY5 and Union3) and Hubble parameter measurements.

Double detonation models have shown promise for explaining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with a variety of luminosities. A key feature of such models is unburnt He in the ejecta, which can show significant variation in both its mass and velocity distribution. Many previous radiative transfer simulations for double detonation models have neglected treatment of non-thermal ionization and excitation, preventing them from robustly assessing whether He spectral features are expected to form. We present a non local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer simulation, including treatment for non-thermal electrons, for a double detonation model with a modest mass of He (${\\sim}$0.04 M${\\odot}$) ejected at reasonably low velocities (${\\sim}$12000$\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).

For some normal SNe Ia the Mg feature shows an extended blue wing, previously attributed to C I, however the simulated He feature shows its strongest absorption at wavelengths consistent with this wing. We therefore suggest this extended wing is instead a spectral signature of He.

Comparison with numerical simulation results as well as their gradients verified the reliability of the influence Equation.

These violent events are broadly used in studies of general relativity and cosmology. However, obtaining precise stellar parameter measurements for both components of CWDBs is a challenging task given their low luminosities, swift time variation, and complex orbits. High-resolution spectra (R$> 20 000$) are preferred but expensive, resulting in a sample size that is insufficient for robust population study. To release the full potential of the less expensive low-resolution spectroscopic surveys, and thus greatly expand the CWDB sample size, it is necessary to develop a robust pipeline for spectra decomposition and analysis. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to build spectrum generators for DA/DB white dwarfs and main-sequence stars. The best-fit stellar parameters were obtained by finding the least $\\chi^2$ solution to these feature lines and the continuum simultaneously.

This population likely existed at high redshifts (z$\\sim$10), relics of which we posit exist today as dwarf galaxies. Previous work argues that the initial mass function (IMF) of the EEP must be flatter than those found at lower redshifts, but with considerable uncertainties. In this work, we present a more quantitative model for the EEP and demonstrate how observational constraints can be applied to the IMF using supernova Type Ia (SNIa) rates, delay time distribution (DTD), and the luminosity function (LF) of galaxy clusters. We determine best-fit values for the slope and mass break of the IMF by comparing IMFs from literature with observed DTDs and the low-luminosity component ($M(R)< -12$) of the Coma LF.

From our observations, we derived the diameter of the limb-darkened disk and found that this star has a radius of $1.04\\pm0.01$ milliarcseconds (mas), or $564 - 700~R\\_\\odot$. We performed image reconstructions with three different image reconstruction software packages, and they unveiled the presence of giant hot and cold spots on the stellar surface. We interpret these prominent hot spots as giant convection cells, suggesting a possible connection to mass ejections from the star's envelope. Furthermore, we detected spectral CO emission lines in the K-band ($\\lambda=2.31-2.38 ~\\mu$m), and the image reconstructions in these spectral lines revealed an extended circumstellar envelope with a radius of $1.45\\pm0.10$ mas.\n\n", "2408.02670": "2024-08-05, **A Targeted Search for Variable Gravitationally Lensed Quasars**, William Sheu et.al., [2408.02670v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02670v1)\n\n We present a pipeline to identify photometric variability within strong gravitationally lensing candidates, in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. In our first paper (Sheu et al. 2023), we laid out our pipeline and presented seven new gravitationally lensed supernovae candidates in a retrospective search. In this companion paper, we apply a modified version of that pipeline to search for gravitationally lensed quasars. From a sample of 5807 strong lenses, we have identified 13 new gravitationally lensed quasar candidates (three of them quadruply-lensed). We note that our methodology differs from most lensed quasar search algorithms that solely rely on the morphology, location, and color of the candidate systems. By also taking into account the temporal photometric variability of the posited lensed images in our search via difference imaging, we have discovered new lensed quasar candidates. While variability searches using difference imaging algorithms have been done in the past, they are typically preformed over vast swathes of sky, whereas we specifically target strong gravitationally lensed candidates. We also have applied our pipeline to 655 known gravitationally lensed quasar candidates from past lensed quasar searches, of which we identify 13 that display significant variability (one of them quadruply-lensed). This pipeline demonstrates a promising search strategy to discover gravitationally lensed quasars in other existing and upcoming surveys.\n\n", "2408.02643": "2024-08-05, **Origin of LAMOST J1010+2358 Revisited**, S. K.

Although thousands of VMP stars have been discovered, the identification of a VMP star with a PISN signature has been elusive. Recently, the VMP star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be the first star with a clear PISN signature. A subsequent study showed that ejecta from low-mass core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can also fit the abundance pattern equally well and additional elements such as C and Al are required to differentiate the two sources. Follow-up observations of LAMOST J1010+2358 by two independent groups were able to detect both C and Al. Additionally, key odd elements such as Na and Sc were also detected whose abundances were found to be higher than the upper limits found in the original detection. We perform a detailed analysis of the newly observed abundance patterns by exploring various possible formation channels for VMP stars. We find that purely low-mass CCSN ejecta as well as the combination of CCSN and Type 1a SN ejecta can provide an excellent fit to the newly observed abundance pattern. Our results confirm earlier analysis that the newly observed abundance pattern is peculiar but has no signatures of PISN.\n\n", "2408.02583": "2024-08-05, **Generating variable $\\hbar$ and $c$ via Fujii-Wetterich model in curved spacetimes**, Hoang Ky Nguyen et.al., [2408.02583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583v1)\n\n We revisit the Fujii-Wetterich model [Phys.Rev.D 26, 2580 (1982) and Nucl.Phys.B 302, 645 (1988)] which allows the Higgs doublet to couple with a \"cosmon\" scalar $\\chi$ of the background spacetime as $\\chi^2\\,\\Phi^2$. Upon the SSB of the $SU(2)$ gauge, the VEV of the Higgs doublet is proportional to the field $\\chi$. Fujii and Wetterich employed this linkage to make particle masses dependent on $\\chi$. We shall present an $\\textit alternative$ mechanism: at a given point $x^*$, the prevailing Higgs VEV will be used to $\\textit construct$ a quantum of action $\\hbar\\_*$ and a speed of light $c\\_*$ in association with $\\chi(x^*)$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\\hbar\\_*$ and $c\\_*$, whereas particle masses induced via Higgs SSB remain independent of $\\chi(x^*)$. Our mechanism unambiguously generates the dependencies $\\hbar\\_*\\propto\\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c\\_*\\propto\\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these \"fundamental constants\" to vary along with the dynamical field $\\chi$ across the manifold. For late-time cosmology, a varying $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards Earth renders the classic Lema\\^itre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-1}$ inapplicable. Using the dependency $c\\_*\\propto\\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, we derive the new (variable-$c$) Lema\\^itre redshift relation and apply it to analyze the Pantheon Catalog of SneIa $\\textit without$ invoking the dark energy hypothesis. Key consequences are: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog with a fit exceeding the quality of the $\\Lambda$CDM model; (2) Explaining the late-time cosmic acceleration based on variable $c$, eliminating the need for dark energy; (3) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&A 412, 35 (2003)].\n\n", "2408.02365": "2024-08-05, **Non-parametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of DESI**, Jun-Qian Jiang et.al., [2408.02365v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02365v1)\n\n We non-parametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \\lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\\lesssim 10\\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \\sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \\sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w\\_0w\\_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r\\_dH\\_0)=29.90 \\pm 0.33$ (with $r\\_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag), which slightly reduces the Hubble tension and makes room for a more important role of late-time new physics in this context, albeit still remaining a sub-dominant part of the solution.

Our results suggest that constraining the dust emissivity indices of high-redshift galaxies is important not only to mitigate systematic uncertainties in their dust masses and obscured star formation rates, but also to assess if dust properties evolve across cosmic time. We present an efficient observing setup to do so with ALMA, combining observations of the peak and Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the dust emission.\n\n", "2408.02228": "2024-08-05, **Strong Chemical Tagging in FIRE: Intra and Inter-Cluster Chemical Homogeneity in Open Clusters in Milky Way-like Galaxy Simulations**, Binod Bhattarai et.al., [2408.02228v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02228v1)\n\n Open star clusters are the essential building blocks of the Galactic disk; \"strong chemical tagging\" - the premise that all star clusters can be reconstructed given chemistry information alone - is a driving force behind many current and upcoming large Galactic spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we characterize abundance patterns for 9 elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe) in open clusters (OCs) in three galaxies (m12i, m12f, and m12m) from the Latte suite of FIRE-2 simulations to investigate if strong chemical tagging is possible in these simulations. We select young massive (>=10^(4.6) Msun) OCs formed in the last ~100 Myr and calculate the intra- and inter-cluster abundance scatter for these clusters. We compare these results with analogous calculations drawn from observations of OCs in the Milky Way. We find the intra-cluster scatter of the observations and simulations to be comparable. While the abundance scatter within each cluster is minimal (<0.020 dex), the mean abundance patterns of different clusters are not unique. We also calculate the chemical difference in intra- and inter-cluster star pairs and find it, in general, to be so small that it is difficult to distinguish between stars drawn from the same OC or from different OCs. Despite tracing three distinct nucleosynthetic families (core-collapse supernovae, white dwarf supernovae, and stellar winds), we conclude that these elemental abundances do not provide enough discriminating information to use strong chemical tagging for reliable OC membership.\n\n"}}
