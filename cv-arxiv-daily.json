The distinctive signal is obtained from the de-excitation of $^{13}$C$^*$ into the ground state emitting a 3.685 MeV photon in various liquid scintillator detectors. Such an interaction predominantly occurs for the reactor anti-neutrinos within the energy range coinciding with the 5 MeV bump. For a detector that has a capability of 95\\% level photon and electron separation and small thorium contamination below $5 \\times 10^{-17}$ gr/gr located in a site with an overburden of about a few hundred m.w.e, such as the location of near detectors of RENO and Daya Bay will have a great sensitivity to resolve the 5 MeV bump. In addition, we propose a novel approach to track the time evolution of reactor isotopes by analyzing our $^{13}$C signal shedding light on the contributions from $^{235}$U or $^{239}$Pu to the observed bump. This provides an extra powerful tool in both discriminating the flux models and testing any new physics possibilities for the 5 MeV bump at 3$\\sigma$ to 5$\\sigma$ level with much less systematic uncertainties and assuming 10 kt.year of data collection.

It is well-established that compared to the presence of free-streaming radiation, CMB spectra shift to higher $\\ell$-modes in the presence of self-interacting non-photon radiation such as neutrinos and dark radiation. In this study, we further demonstrate that the scattering of non-photon radiation with dark matter can further amplify this phase shift. We show that when the energy density of the interacting radiation surpasses that of interacting dark matter around matter-radiation equality, the phase shift enhancement is proportional to the interacting dark matter abundance and remains insensitive to the radiation energy density. Given the presence of dark matter-radiation interaction, this additional phase shift emerges as a generic signature of models featuring an interacting dark sector or neutrino-dark matter scattering. Using neutrino-dark matter scattering as an example, we numerically calculate the amplified phase shift and offer an analytical interpretation of the result by modeling photon and neutrino perturbations with coupled harmonic oscillators. This framework also explains the phase shift contrast between self-interacting and free-streaming neutrinos. Fitting models with neutrino-dark matter or dark radiation-dark matter interactions to CMB and large-scale structure data, we validate the presence of the enhanced phase shift, affirmed by the linear dependence observed between the preferred regions of the sound horizon angle $\\theta\\_s$ and interacting dark matter abundance.\n\n", "2405.07952": "2024-05-13, **White paper on ($\u03b1$, n) neutron yields calculation**, D.

Since such a low mass BH cannot be formed via stellar evolution, a model has been proposed based on the core collapse of a neutron star initiated by a certain number of dark matter (DM) particles. In this process, the accumulated DM particles collapse to form a tiny BH inside the neutron star, and the entire neutron star is transmuted into a BH after a certain time due to the accretion of matter by the endoparasitic BH from its host. Here, we argue that, depending on the initial conditions, a dark core collapse could give rise to either a BH or a naked singularity. For example, if the accumulated cloud of DM particles in the core of a neutron star can be modeled as an anisotropic fluid and it fulfils the criterion for collapse, an endoparasitic naked singularity could form instead of an endoparasitic BH. Immediately after its formation, the naked singularity should begin accreting matter from the host neutron star, thus eventually transmuting the entire host into a near-solar mass, relatively slowly-spinning naked singularity. We also propose a general technique to constrain the DM particle--neutron scattering cross section using the lack of pulsars near the Galactic centre and assuming that these missing pulsars have already been transmuted into BHs and/or naked singularities. Thus, the missing pulsars also indicate the existence of many such singularities near the Galactic center.\n\n", "2405.08744": "2024-05-14, **Universal Acceleration and Fuzzy Dark Matter**, Douglas Edmonds et.al., [2405.08744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08744v1)\n\n Observations of velocity dispersions of galactic structures over a wide range of scales point to the existence of a universal acceleration scale $a\\_0\\sim 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$.

In this model, choosing a suitable function for non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(\\phi)$ gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during the FR stage is amplified in comparison with slow-roll (SR) stage. Hence, seeds of PBHs production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter (DM), microlensing effects, LIGO-VIRGO events and NANOGrav 15 year data can be formed.

We focus on five galaxy clusters from the X-COP sample, for which high-quality data are available on both the baryonic mass distribution (gas and stars) and internal dynamics (from the hydrostatic equilibrium of hot gas and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect). We confirm that galaxy clusters require additional `missing matter' in MOND, although the required amount is drastically reduced with respect to the non-baryonic dark matter in the context of Newtonian dynamics. We studied the spatial distribution of the missing matter by fitting the acceleration profiles of the clusters with a Bayesian method, finding that a physical density profile with an inner core and an outer $r^{-4}$ decline (giving a finite total mass) provide good fits within $\\sim$1 Mpc. At larger radii, the fit results are less satisfactory but the combination of the MOND external field effect and hydrostatic bias (quantified as 10$\\%$-40$\\%$) can play a key role. The missing mass must be more centrally concentrated than the intracluster medium (ICM). For relaxed clusters (A1795, A2029, A2142), the ratio of missing-to-visible mass is around $1-5$ at $R\\simeq200-300$ kpc and decreases to $0.4-1.1$ at $R\\simeq2-3$ Mpc, showing that the total amount of missing mass is smaller than or comparable to the ICM mass.

An intriguing variation of this scenario is the mass-varying dark matter model where the dark matter mass varies with time during its cosmic history. This is realized in multiple particle physics models. In this work, we study the cosmological constraints on such a model where the dark matter mass transitions from zero to a finite value in the early Universe. In this model, the matter power spectrum exhibits power suppression below a scale that depends on the epoch of transition, and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background show a distinctive phase shift.

Our study reinforces more importance of uniformly distributed pressure effects throughout the less complex region than to the emergence of energy density homogeneity in the stability of fuzzy wormholes. It is shown that the active gravitational mass of the fuzzy wormhole structures varies inversely with the radial distance thereby suggesting the breaching of energy conditions at some arena of Einasto index. Furthermore, it is revealed that stable fuzzy dark matter wormhole structures exist in nature in the surroundings of cold dark matter halos and galactic bulges.

Here we examine the possible trajectories of a PBH that is captured by a Sun-like star. When in motion in the interior of the star, the amount of stellar mass that effectively interacts with the PBH will be a function of its distance to the center of the star.

For example, anisotropic electronic and thermal transport are thought to be beneficial for thermoelectric applications, while anisotropic mechanical properties are of interest for emerging metamaterials, and anisotropic dielectric materials have been suggested as a novel platform for dark matter detection. Understanding and tailoring anisotropy in crystals is therefore essential for the design of next-generation functional materials. To date, however, most data-driven approaches have focused on the prediction of scalar crystal properties, such as the spherically averaged dielectric tensor or the bulk and shear elastic moduli. Here, we adopt the latest approaches in equivariant graph neural networks to develop a model that can predict the full dielectric tensor of crystals. Our model, trained on the Materials Project dataset of c.a. 6,700 dielectric tensors, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in scalar dielectric prediction in addition to capturing the directional response. We showcase the performance of the model by discovering crystals with almost isotropic connectivity but highly anisotropic dielectric tensors, thereby broadening our knowledge of the structure-property relationships in dielectric crystals.\n\n", "2405.07546": "2024-05-13, **Dynamical systems of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity: cosmological implications**, Ashutosh Singh et.al., [2405.07546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07546v1)\n\n In this paper, we derive the field equations of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity termed as $f(R,G)$ gravity for the non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime.

These constraints allow one to deduce the effective mass $M$, which causes uncertainties in the measurement.

The former framework also introduces an Appell function, a hypergeometric function of two variables that separately allows the analysis of macroscopic and (hypothetical) microscopic black holes. This first framework was found to decrease the radii of the null regions respective to the Schwarzschild counterpart. The shadow radius, however, behaves reversibly. The result of the numerical analysis for the latter framework revealed increased values for the photonsphere and shadow radii. Remarkably, the study also showed that for SMBHs, the amplifying effects of $\\lambda\\_{\\rm G}$ are stronger than the scale length $l$.

A kinematic analysis of our sample and literature stars reveals them to be fast-moving halo objects, all with retrograde motion, indicating an accretion origin. Because SASS stars are much brighter than typical UFD stars, identifying them offers promising ways towards detailed studies of early star formation environments. From the chemical abundances of SASS stars, it appears that the earliest accreted systems were likely enriched by a few supernovae whose light element yields varied from system to system. Neutron-capture elements were sparsely produced and/or diluted, with $r$-process nucleosynthesis playing a role. These insights offer a glimpse into the early formation of the Galaxy.

We find that the total p-nuclei yields are only marginally affected by the CCSN explosion prescriptions if the $\\gamma$-process production is already efficient in the stellar progenitors due to a C-O shell merger. In most of CCSN explosions from progenitors without C-O shell merger, the $\\gamma$-process yields increase with the explosion energy up to an order of magnitude, depending on the progenitor structure and the CCSN prescriptions. The trend of the p-nuclei production with the explosion energy is more complicated if we look at the production of single p-nuclei. The light p-nuclei tend to be the most enhanced with increasing the explosion energy. In particular, for the CCSN models where the $\\alpha$-rich freeze-out component is ejected, the yields of the lightest p-nuclei increase by up to three orders of magnitude. We provide the first extensive study using different sets of massive stars of the impact of varying CCSN explosion prescriptions on the production of the p-nuclei. Unlike previous expectations and recent results in the literature, we find that the average production of p-nuclei tends to increase with the explosion energy. We also confirm that the pre-explosive production of p-nuclei in C-O shell mergers is a robust result, independently from the subsequent explosive nucleosynthesis.
