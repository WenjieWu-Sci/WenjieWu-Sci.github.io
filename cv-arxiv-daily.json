Sevestrean et.al., [2304.10373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10373v1)\n\n This paper presents a comprehensive study of electron capture (EC) ratios across a wide range of nuclei using a self-consistent computational method. We have incorporated important effects such as overlap and exchange corrections, shake-up and shake-off effects in the EC formalism. The electronic wave functions were computed in the Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater (DHFS) framework, accounting for electron screening and correlations in the atomic structure description. The DHFS framework was chosen based on the systematic comparison of binding energies and Coulomb amplitudes with previous theoretical models and experimental data. The main feature of this paper is the refined determination of the emitted neutrino energy, which requires extensive atomic structure calculations but leads to much better agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental values, especially for low-energy transitions. Detailed results are presented for nuclei of practical interest ($^{67}\\mathrm{Ga}$, $^{111}\\mathrm{In}$, $^{123}\\mathrm{I}$, $^{125}\\mathrm{I}$ and $^{125}\\mathrm{Xe}$) in nuclear medicine and exotic physics searches involving liquid Xenon detectors.

We show that with the weak interaction turned on the equivalence of particles and antiparticles is violated. We also discuss that within the Standard Model even free neutrinos are exceptions, they can be produced only in chiral states.

This $Z\\_4$ symmetry should be spontaneously broken down to the $Z\\_2$ symmetry to generate the heavy Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos. We show that this symmetry breaking naturally generates topological inflation, which is consistent with the CMB observations at present and predicts a significant tensor mode with scalar-tensor ratio $r > 0.03$.

We search for Lyman-break dropout-selected galaxies using HST WFC3/ACS broadband imaging in the fields of three $6 < z < 7$ quasars, as well as their simultaneously observed coordinated-parallel fields, and constrain their photometric redshifts using EAZY.

M. Karp et.al., [2304.10403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10403v1)\n\n The quenched fraction of satellite galaxies is aligned with the orientation of the halo's central galaxy, such that on average, satellites form stars at a lower rate along the major axis of the central. This effect, called anisotropic satellite galaxy quenching (ASGQ), has been found in observational data and cosmological simulations. Analyzing the IllustrisTNG simulation, Mart\\'in-Navarro et al. (2021) recently argued that ASGQ is caused by anisotropic energetic feedback and constitutes \"compelling observational evidence for the role of black holes in regulating galaxy evolution.\" In this letter, we study the causes of ASGQ in state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations to evaluate this claim. We show that cosmological simulations predict that on average, satellite galaxies along the major axis of the dark matter halo tend to have been accreted at earlier cosmic times and are hosted by subhalos of larger peak halo masses. As a result, a modulation of the quenched fraction with respect to the major axis of the central galaxy is a natural prediction of hierarchical structure formation. We show that ASGQ is predicted by the UniverseMachine galaxy formation model, a model without anisotropic feedback. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even in the IllustrisTNG simulation, anisotropic satellite accretion properties are the main cause of ASGQ. Ultimately, we argue that ASGQ is not a reliable indicator of supermassive black hole feedback in galaxy formation simulations and, thus, should not be interpreted as such in observational data.\n\n", "2304.10301": "2023-04-20, **No evidence for p- or d-wave dark matter annihilation from local large-scale structure**, Andrija Kosti\u0107 et.al., [2304.10301v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10301v1)\n\n If dark matter annihilates into standard model particles with a cross-section which is velocity dependent, then Local Group dwarf galaxies will not be the best place to search for the resulting gamma ray emission.

We focus on the semiclassical regime where the quantum pressure is typically much smaller than the self-interactions. We present numerical simulations, with initial conditions where the halo is described by the WKB approximation for its eigenfunction coefficients. We find that when the size of the system is of the order of the Jeans length associated with the self-interactions, a central soliton quickly forms and makes about 50% of the total mass. However, if the halo is ten times greater than this self-interaction scale, a soliton only quickly forms in cuspy halos where the central density is large enough to trigger the self-interactions. If the halo has a flat core, it takes a longer time for a soliton to appear, after small random fluctuations on the de Broglie wavelength size build up to reach a large enough density. In some cases, we observe the co-existence of several narrow density spikes inside the larger self-interaction-supported soliton. All solitons appear robust and slowly grow, unless they already make up 40% of the total mass. We develop a kinetic theory, valid for an inhomogeneous background, to estimate the soliton growth rate for low masses. It explains the fast falloff of the growth rate as resonances between the ground state and halo excited states disappear. Our results suggest that cosmological halos would show a large scatter for their soliton mass, depending on their assembly history.\n\n", "2304.10128": "2023-04-20, **Examining the Self-Interaction of Dark Matter through Central Cluster Galaxy Offsets**, Dane Cross et.al., [2304.10128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10128v1)\n\n While collisionless cold dark matter models have been largely successful in explaining a wide range of observational data, some tensions still exist, and it remains possible that dark matter possesses a non-negligible level of self interactions. In this paper, we investigate a possible observable consequence of self-interacting dark matter: offsets between the central galaxy and the center of mass of its parent halo. We examine 23 relaxed galaxy clusters in a redshift range of 0.1 to 0.3 drawn from clusters in the Dark Energy Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which have archival Chandra X-ray data of sufficient depth for center and relaxation determination. We find that most clusters in our sample show non-zero offsets between the X-ray center, taken to be the centroid within the cluster core, and the central galaxy position. All of the measured offsets are larger, typically by an order of magnitude, than the uncertainty in the X-ray position due to Poisson noise. In all but six clusters, the measured offsets are also larger than the estimated, combined astrometric uncertainties in the X-ray and optical positions. A more conservative cut on concentration to select relaxed clusters marginally reduces but does not eliminate the observed offset. With our more conservative sample, we find an estimated mean X-ray to central galaxy offset of $\\mu = 5.5 \\pm 1.0$ kpc.

Leading candidates for DM are weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or ultralight bosons (axions), at opposite extremes in mass scales, that have been postulated by competing theories to solve deficiencies in the Standard Model of particle physics. Whereas DM WIMPs behave like discrete particles ($\\varrho$DM), quantum interference between DM axions is manifested as waves ($\\psi$DM).

We present the first cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way analogues where the majority of dark matter is collisionless Cold Dark Matter (CDM), but a sub-component (6%) is strongly dissipative minimal Atomic Dark Matter (ADM). The simulations, implemented in GIZMO and utilizing FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics to model the standard baryonic sector, demonstrate that the addition of even a small fraction of dissipative dark matter can significantly impact galactic evolution despite being consistent with current cosmological constraints. We show that ADM gas with roughly Standard-Model-like masses and couplings can cool to form a rotating \"dark disk\" with angular momentum closely aligned with the visible stellar disk. The morphology of the disk depends sensitively on the parameters of the ADM model, which affect the cooling rates in the dark sector. The majority of the ADM gas gravitationally collapses into dark \"clumps\" (regions of black hole or mirror star formation), which form a prominent bulge and a rotating thick disk in the central galaxy.

We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the final mass and concentration of dark matter halos from the initial conditions. The CNN is then used as a surrogate model to derive the response of the halos' mass and concentration to long-wavelength perturbations in the initial conditions, and consequently the halo bias parameters following the \"response bias\" definition. The CNN correctly predicts how the local properties of dark matter halos respond to changes in the large-scale environment, despite no explicit knowledge of halo bias being provided during training. We show that the CNN recovers the known trends for the linear and second-order density bias parameters $b\\_1$ and $b\\_2$, as well as for the local primordial non-Gaussianity linear bias parameter $b\\_\\phi$. The expected secondary assembly bias dependence on halo concentration is also recovered by the CNN: at fixed mass, halo concentration has only a mild impact on $b\\_1$, but a strong impact on $b\\_\\phi$.

The mass of the invisible matter halo of galaxy NGC 3198 calculated with MGR is identical to the result obtained from GR using a dark matter profile. Although dark matter in MGR is described geometrically, it has an equivalent representation as a particle with the property of a vector boson or a pair of fermions; the geometry of spacetime and the quantum nature of matter are linked together by the unit line element covectors that belong to both the Lorentzian metric and the spin-1 Klein-Gordon wave equation.

We base our modelling on literature delayed-detonation and deflagration models of Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, as well as the double-detonation models of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. We present a new method for 'projecting' abundance profiles to different density profiles for ease of computation. Due to the small velocity extent and low outer densities of the W7 profile, we find it inadequate to reproduce the evolution of SN 2021rhu as it fails to match the high-velocity calcium components. The host extinction of SN 2021rhu is uncertain but we use modelling with and without an extinction correction to set lower and upper limits on the abundances of individual species. Comparing these limits to literature models we conclude that the spectral evolution of SN 2021rhu is also incompatible with double-detonation scenarios, lying more in line with those resulting from the delayed detonation mechanism (although there are some discrepancies, in particular a larger titanium abundance in SN 2021rhu compared to the literature). This suggests that SN 2021rhu is likely a lower luminosity, and hence lower temperature, version of a normal SN Ia.\n\n", "2304.09766": "2023-04-19, **On the energy flow of $\u03bb$ in Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz cosmology**, Ewa Czuchry et.al., [2304.09766v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09766v1)\n\n Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity has been proposed as a ghost-free quantum gravity model candidate with an anisotropic UV-scaling between space and time. We present here a cosmological background analysis of two different formulations of the theory, with particular focus on the running of the parameter $\\lambda$. Using a large dataset consisting of Cosmic Microwave Background data from {\\it Planck}, Pantheon+ supernovae catalogue, SH0ES Cepheid variable stars, Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Chronometers, and gamma-ray bursts (GRB), we arrive at new bounds on the cosmological parameters, in particular $\\lambda$, which describes deviation from classical general relativity. For the detailed balance scenario we arrive at the bound $\\lambda=1.02726\\pm0.00012$, and for beyond detailed balance the limit reads $\\lambda=0.9949^{+0.0045}\\_{-0.0046}$. We also study the influence of different data sets and priors, and we find that removing low-redshift data generally moves $\\lambda$ closer towards UV values, whilst simultaneously widening the error bars. In the detailed balance scenario, this effect is more noticeable, and $\\lambda$ takes on values that are significantly below unity, which corresponds to the infrared limit of the theory.\n\n", "2304.09508": "2023-04-19, **POLAR -- I: linking the 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization to galaxy formation**, Qing-Bo Ma et.al., [2304.09508v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09508v1)\n\n To self-consistently model galactic properties, reionization of the intergalactic medium, and the associated 21-cm signal, we have developed the algorithm polar by integrating the one-dimensional radiative transfer code grizzly with the semi-analytical galaxy formation code L-Galaxies 2020. Our proof-of-concept results are consistent with observations of the star formation rate history, UV luminosity function and the CMB Thomson scattering optical depth. We then investigate how different galaxy formation models affect UV luminosity functions and 21-cm power spectra, and find that while the former are most sensitive to the parameters describing the merger of halos, the latter have a stronger dependence on the supernovae feedback parameters, and both are affected by the escape fraction model.\n\n", "2304.09350": "2023-04-19, **Black holes as the end state of stellar evolution: Theory and simulations**, Alexander Heger et.al., [2304.09350v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09350v1)\n\n The collapse of massive stars is one of the most-studied paths to black hole formation. In this chapter, we review black hole formation during the collapse of massive stars in the broader context of single and binary stellar evolution and the theory of supernova explosions. We provide a concise overview of the evolutionary channels that may lead to black hole formation -- the classical route of iron core collapse, collapse due to pair instability in very massive stars, and the hypothetical scenario of supermassive star collapse. We then review the current understanding of the parameter space for black hole formation and black hole birth properties that has emerged from theoretical and computational modelling of supernova explosions and transient observations. Finally, we discuss what the intricate interplay between stellar evolution, stellar explosions, and binary interactions implies for the formation of stellar-mass black holes.\n\n"}}
