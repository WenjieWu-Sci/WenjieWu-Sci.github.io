Martin et.al., [2307.16793v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16793v1)\n\n In hot and dense astrophysical environments, neutrinos are emitted in such numbers that their flavor content is expected to have an appreciable effect on the local system's dynamic and chemical evolution. In this work, we consider such a gas in the regime for which neutrino-neutrino coherent forward scattering dominates the flavor evolution. We show evidence that the generic potential induced by this effect is non-integrable and that the statistics of its energy level spaces are in good agreement with the Wigner surmise. We also find that individual neutrinos rapidly entangle with all of the others present which results in an equilibration of the flavor content of individual neutrinos. We show that the average neutrino flavor content can be predicted utilizing a thermodynamic partition function. A random phase approximation to the evolution gives a simple picture of this equilibration. In the case of neutrinos and antineutrinos, processes like $\\nu\\_e {\\bar{\\nu}}\\_e \\leftrightarrows \\nu\\_\\mu {\\bar{\\nu}\\_\\mu} $ yield a rapid equilibrium satisfying $n( \\nu\\_e) n({\\bar \\nu}\\_e) = n( \\nu\\_\\mu) n({\\bar \\nu}\\_\\mu) = n( \\nu\\_\\tau) n({\\bar \\nu}\\_\\tau)$ in addition to the standard lepton number conservation in regimes where off-diagonal vacuum oscillations are small compared to $\\nu-\\nu$ interactions.\n\n", "2307.16698": "2023-07-31, **Estimating at Earth the Ultra-High Energy Neutrino Flux from the Accretion Disks in the Galactic Core**, Ayshea Bains et.al., [2307.16698v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16698v1)\n\n This research is to determine at Earth the high-energy neutrino flux coming from the galactic core, and from the many other accretion disks within the galactic core. It is estimated there are 10,000 such accretion disk within the cubic parsec of the galactic core alone and many more in the galactic core halo. There are various neutrino detectors, such as IceCube, which can detect energetic neutrinos. However, the direct galactic core neutrino flux is exceptionally low, so very few neutrinos from the galactic core are measured. We created two models to simulate the galactic core neutrino flux. To better estimate the neutrino flux we randomly distributed the accretion disks and generated bodies of varying sizes. This was then used to determine the ultra-high energy neutrino flux. Since it is extremely difficult to determine neutrino direction from interactions of neutrinos, we envision an application where the energetic galactic core neutrinos are gravitationally focused by the Sun with a large light collecting power of eleven to twelve orders of magnitude. They could interact in a planet's atmosphere where the produced showers containing energetic charged particles can produce Cherenkov rings imageable by an orbiting spacecraft or upward going muons which can be observed in a cosmic ray experiment. Estimating the flux will provide a general approximation of the number of ultra-high energy neutrinos that should reach Earth, with Earth being the overall detector. Moreover, studying the neutrinos will provide more information on the conditions of the galactic region, and allow characterizations of it to be formed.\n\n", "2307.16667": "2023-07-31, **Two Candidate Obscured Tidal Disruption Events Coincident with High-Energy Neutrinos**, Ning Jiang et.al., [2307.16667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16667v1)\n\n Recently, three optical tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) have been suggested to be coincident with high-energy neutrinos. They all exhibit unusually strong dust infrared (IR) echoes, with their peak times matching the neutrino arrival time even better than the optical peaks.

The two candidates show negligible optical variability according to their ZTF light curves and can therefore be classified as part of the growing population of obscured TDE candidates.

Within the constraint from IceCube neutrino non-detection, the limitations for key physical parameters of this burst are extracted in different scenarios including the fireball, Poynting-flux-dominated (PFD) and hybrid jet. Different from the former nearby `monsters' and due to its smaller isotropic equivalent radiated energy ($E\\_{\\gamma,\\rm iso}\\sim4\\times10^{52}$ erg), the constraint seems loose if non-thermal neutrinos produced from photomeson interactions are the only consideration. However, a quasi-thermal neutrino emission from hadronuclear processes is constrained in this neutron-rich post-merger environment, and the upper limit of the allowed nucleon loading factor is about a few.

In this model, U(1)$\\_X$ is a generalization of the well-known U(1) $B-L$. Apart from the MSSM particle content, the model includes three right-handed neutrino (RHN) chiral superfields, each carrying a unit U(1)$\\_X$ charge.

Two of the RHN superfields are assigned an odd R-parity, while the last one ($\\Psi$) has an even parity. The U(1)$\\_X$ symmetry is radiatively broken by the VEV of the scalar component of $\\Psi$. As a consequence of the absence of U(1)$\\_X$ Higgs fields and the novel R-parity assignment, the three light neutrinos consist of one massless neutrino and two Dirac neutrinos.

The observed extremely high flux of high and very-high-energy photons provide a unique opportunity to probe the predicted neutrino counterpart to the electromagnetic emission. We have used a variety of methods to search for neutrinos in coincidence with the GRB over several time windows during the precursor, prompt and afterglow phases of the GRB. MeV scale neutrinos are studied using photo-multiplier rate scalers which are normally used to search for galactic core-collapse supernovae neutrinos. GeV neutrinos are searched starting with DeepCore triggers. These events don't have directional localization, but instead can indicate an excess in the rate of events. 10 GeV - 1 TeV and >TeV neutrinos are searched using traditional neutrino point source methods which take into account the direction and time of events with DeepCore and the entire IceCube detector respectively.

We calculated CMB forward scattering by those probable candidates of DM to generate $\\beta$ in the presence of primordial scalar fluctuations' background. We explicitly plotted bounds on the mass and electromagnetic coupling for different sectors of DM, sterile neutrino, and dipolar DM, and compared them with other experimental bounds.

This effect is very important for scientific experiments that performed by low-energy electron spectroscopy measurements. However, the atomic exchange effect involves multi-electron interactions, especially for a system with 82 electrons such as lead.

Using 761 galaxy clusters with $M\\_{200c} \\gtrsim 10^{14}M\\_\\odot$ from the TNG-300 simulation at $z<1$, we train the algorithm to read in maps of projected dark matter mass and output maps of projected gas density, temperature, and X-ray flux.

Cosmological scalar fields for dark energy and dark matter may be considered as a result of Bose-Einstein condensation. In this regard, our main attention will be devoted to BECs in curved space. By considering the dynamics of a BEC scalar field at a microscopic level, we first study the initial phase of the formation of condensation in cosmology. To this end, we initially introduce an effective Minkowski space formulation that enables considering only the effect of particle physics processes, excluding the effect of gravitational particle production and enabling us to see cosmological evolution more easily. Then, by using this formulation, we study a model with a trilinear coupling that induces the processes. After considering the phase evolution of the produced particles, we find that they evolve towards the formation of a BEC if some specific conditions are satisfied. In principle, the effective Minkowski space formulation introduced in this study can be applied to particle physics processes in any sufficiently smooth spacetime. In this regard, we also analyse if a BEC scalar field is realized in the spacetime around a Reissner - Nordstr\\\"om black hole. We find that the produced particles of particle physics processes are localized in a region around the black hole and have a tendency toward condensation if the emerged particles are much heavier than ingoing particles.

With 182 GRBs at $0.8\\le z\\le8.2$ in the Hubble diagram and the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we obtained $\\Omega\\_{\\rm m}$ = $0.348^{+0.048}\\_{-0.066}$ and $h$ = $0.680^{+0.029}\\_{-0.029}$ for the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, and $\\Omega\\_{\\rm m}$ = $0.318^{+0.067}\\_{-0.059}$, $h$ = $0.704^{+0.055}\\_{-0.068}$, $w$ = $-1.21^{+0.32}\\_{-0.67}$ for the flat $w$CDM model. These results are consistent with those in which the coefficients of the Amati relation and the cosmological parameters fitted simultaneously.\n\n"}}
