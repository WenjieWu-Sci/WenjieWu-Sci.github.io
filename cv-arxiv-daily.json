Current disagreement on late and early time observations of the Universe expansion could be solved with new physics acting before the recombination era. Nonstandard neutrino self-interactions are among the most appealing candidates to solve this issue since they could be testable in the near (or middle) future. We use linear cosmological datasets to test neutrino self-interactions for a sample of fixed scalar mediator masses in the range $10^{-2}$ eV $\\leq m\\_{\\varphi}\\leq 10^{2}$ eV. The resonant behavior produces observable effects at lower couplings than those reported in the literature for heavy and light mediators. We observe that in the best case scenario, using the Planck + BAO dataset, the tension with local measurements of $H\\_0$ eases from 4.9$\\sigma$ (for $\\Lambda$CDM) down to 2.8$\\sigma$.

Depending on the rate of rotation and the magnetic field strength before collapse as well as on possible mechanisms amplifying the magnetic field, such a core can explode magnetorotationally rather than via the standard supernova mechanism based on neutrino heating. This scenario can explain the highest kinetic energies observed in the class of hypernovae. On longer time scales, rotation and magnetic fields can play an important role in the engine of long gamma-ray burst powered by proto-magnetars or hyperaccreting black holes in collapsars. Both classes of events are characterized by relativistic jets and winds driven by neutrinos or magnetic spin-down of the central objects. The nucleosynthesis in these events includes the production of Fe group elements, including a possibly enhanced synthesis of radioactive 56Ni leading to high peak luminosities. Additionally, these events are, out of all stellar core-collapse events the ones most likely to allow for the formation of the heaviest nuclei via rapid neutron captures. Increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations indicate that at least a limited r-process is possible, though it remains open how robust this result is against variations in the numerical methods and the initial conditions.

The soliton with infinite speed is a homogeneous solution and coincides with the usual fast-flavor pendulum except that it swings only once instead of being periodic. The subluminal soliton in the static limit corresponds to a one-swing \"spatial pendulum\". A necessary condition for such solutions to exist is a ``crossed'' neutrino angle distribution. Based on the Nyquist criterion, we derive a new sufficient condition without solving the dispersion relation. The solitons are very fragile: they are as unstable as the homogeneous neutrino gas alone. Moreover, in the presence of matter, only the solution survives that is homogeneous in a frame comoving with the matter current. Generally, the matter effect cannot be eliminated by transformations in flavor space, but instead has a real physical impact.\n\n", "2303.12055": "2023-03-21, **Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy of Electrons from Tritium Beta Decay and $^{83\\rm m}$Kr Internal Conversion**, Project 8 Collaboration et.al., [2303.12055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12055v1)\n\n Project 8 has developed a novel technique, Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), for direct neutrino mass measurements.

Understanding the chemical abundance dispersion in such extreme environments could shed light on the properties of the first generations of stars in the cosmos. We present a novel inhomogeneous chemical evolution model, i-GEtool, that we apply to two ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, Carina II (Car II) and Reticulum II (Ret II), which are satellites of the Large Magellanic Cloud. In summary, our model is based on the Monte Carlo sampling of the initial mass function as star formation proceeds in different gas cells of the simulated galaxy volume. We account for the chemical enrichment of Supernova bubbles as they spread in the interstellar medium, which causes dispersion in the predicted elemental abundances. We recreate the elemental abundance patterns by focusing on $\\alpha$- and odd-$\\textit{Z}$ elements, predicting two sequences in [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] at all metallicities. Our models systematically underestimate [C/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] because of the large uncertainty in the adopted stellar nucleosynthesis yields. We discuss that the observed C and N abundances had likely been affected by internal mixing processes, which changed the initial surface abundances in the red giants. Our Supernova feedback scheme is responsible for driving galactic outflows, which quench the star formation activity in the simulated galaxies at early times.

Gajovi\u0107 et.al., [2303.12155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12155v1)\n\n Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can self-annihilate and thus provide us with the possibility for an indirect detection of Dark Matter (DM). Dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are excellent places to search for annihilation signals because they are rich in DM and background emission is low. If magnetic fields in dSph exist, the particles produced in DM annihilation emit synchrotron radiation. We use the non-detection of 150 MHz radio continuum emission from dSph galaxies with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to derive constraints on the annihilation cross-section of WIMPs into electron-positron pairs. Our main underlying assumption is that the transport of the CRs can be described by the diffusion approximation which necessitates the existence of magnetic fields. We use observations of six dSph galaxies in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). The data are re-imaged and a radial profile is generated for each galaxy. We also use stacking to increase the sensitivity. In order to derive upper limits on the WIMP cross-section, we inject fake Gaussian sources into the data which are then detected with 2$\\sigma$ significance in the radial profile. These sources represent the lowest emission we would have been able to detect.   We present limits from the observations of individual galaxies as well as from stacking. We explore the uncertainty due to the choice of diffusion and magnetic field parameters by constructing three different model scenarios: optimistic (OPT), intermediate (INT), and pessimistic (PES). Assuming monochromatic annihilation into electron-positron pairs, the limits from the INT scenario exclude thermal WIMPs below 20 GeV and the limits from the OPT scenario even exclude WIMPs below 70 GeV. The INT limits can compete with limits set by Fermi-LAT using $\\gamma$-ray observations of multiple dwarf galaxies and they are especially strong for low WIMP masses.\n\n", "2303.12129": "2023-03-21, **Dark Exoplanets**, Yang Bai et.al., [2303.12129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12129v1)\n\n The prevailing assumption is that all exoplanets are made of ordinary matter. However, we propose an unconventional possibility that some exoplanets could be made of dark matter, which we name \"dark exoplanets.\" In this paper, we explore methods to search for dark exoplanets, including the mass-radius relation, spectroscopy, missing transit, and transit light curve. Specifically, we focus on the transit light curve method and demonstrate how to distinguish partially transparent dark exoplanets from fully opaque ordinary exoplanets using both observed exoplanet data and dark exoplanet mock data.

Due to the rotation of the star and the plasma effects in the magnetosphere the signal is predicted to be periodic with significant time variation - a unique smoking gun for axion dark matter. As a proof of principle and to develop the methodology, we carry out the first time domain search of the signal using data from PSR J2144$-$3933 taken as part of the MeerTIME project on MeerKAT telescope. We search for specific signal templates using a matched filter technique and discuss when a time-domain analysis (as is typically the case in pulsar observations) gives greater sensitivity to the axion-coupling to photons in comparison to a simple time-averaged total flux study. We do not find any candidate signals and, hence, impose an upper limit on the axion-to-photon coupling of $g\\_{a\\gamma\\gamma}<4\\times 10^{-11}\\,{\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ over the mass range $m\\_{\\rm a}=3.9-4.7\\,\\mu{\\rm eV}$ using this data.

However, approximate solutions limit the discussion of traversable wormholes to a large extent. In this work, we construct the exact solution of the traversable wormhole in the case of rotation in the dark matter halo. We have written analytical expressions for the Kerr-like traversable wormhole metric for the dark matter density profile in galaxies corresponding to different dark matter models, respectively. These rotating traversable wormholes are jointly determined by the dark matter characteristic density and the scale radius.

Although several previous pointed Chandra and XMM-Newton observations are available, it is only the second time after the ROSAT all-sky survey that the whole remnant was observed in X-rays with homogeneous sensitivity. Vela Jr is one of the few remnants emitting in the TeV band, making it an important object in shock acceleration studies. However, the age and distance determination using X-ray emission is largely hampered by the presence of the Vela SNR along the same line. With the eROSITA data set our aim is to characterize the emission of Vela Jr and distinguish it from Vela emission, and also to characterize the spectral emission of the inner remnant. We processed the eROSITA data dividing the whole remnant into seven different regions. In addition, images of the whole remnant were employed to pinpoint the position of the geometric center and constrain the proper motion of the CCO. We also employed archival XMM-Newton pointed observations of the NW rim to determine the cutoff energy of the electrons and the expansion velocity. We find the magnetic field can vary between 2 $\\mu$G and 16 $\\mu$G in the NW rim.

The first model is the most general $f(Q)$ formulation that replicates a $\\Lambda$CDM background, with deviations appearing only at the perturbative level. It has one additional free parameter compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, $\\alpha$, which when set to zero falls back to $\\Lambda$CDM. We show that LIGO-Virgo is unable to constrain $\\alpha$, due to the high error and low redshift of the measurements, whereas LISA and the ET will, with the ET outperforming LISA. The catalogs for both LISA and LIGO-Virgo show non-negligible statistical fluctuations, where we consider three representative catalogs (the best, median and worst), whereas for the ET, only a single catalog is considered, as the number of events is large enough for statistical fluctuations to be neglected. The best LISA catalog is the one with more low redshift events, while the worst LISA catalog features fewer low redshift events. Additionally, if we are to observe a bad LISA catalog, we can rely on data from LIGO-Virgo to improve the quality of the constrains, bringing it closer to a median LISA catalog.   The second model attempts to replace dark energy by making use of a specific form of the function $f(Q)$.

Since they result in the expansion of the supernova shock wave into the gaseous environment shaped by the star wind history, their morphology constitutes an insight into the past evolution of their progenitor star. Particularly, fast-moving massive stars can produce asymmetric core-collapse supernova remnants. We investigate the mixing of materials in core-collapse supernova remnants generated by a moving massive 35 Mo star, in a magnetised ISM. Stellar rotation and the wind magnetic field are time-dependently included into the models which follow the entire evolution of the stellar surroundings from the zero age main sequence to 80 kyr after the supernova explosion. It is found that very little main sequence material is present in remnants from moving stars, that the Wolf-Rayet wind mixes very efficiently within the 10 kyr after the explosion, while the red supergiant material is still unmixed by 30 per cent within 50 kyr after the supernova.

We review current theoretical models for the formation, properties and impact of Pop III stars, and discuss existing and future observational constraints. Key takeaways from this review include the following: (1) Primordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation and Pop III stars form as members of small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function. (2) Feedback from massive Pop III stars plays a central role in regulating subsequent star formation, but major uncertainties remain regarding its immediate impact. (3) In extreme conditions, supermassive Pop III stars can form, reaching masses of several 10^5 Msun. Their remnants may be the seeds of the supermassive black holes observed in high-redshift quasars. (4) Direct observations of Pop III stars in the early Universe remain extremely challenging.

(5) Stellar archeological surveys allow us to constrain both the low-mass and the high-mass ends of the Pop III mass distribution. Observations suggest that most massive Pop III stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than as pair-instability supernovae.\n\n", "2303.12437": "2023-03-22, **Vela pulsar wind nebula x-rays are polarized to near the synchrotron limit**, Fei Xie et.al., [2303.12437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12437v1)\n\n Pulsar wind nebulae are formed when outflows of relativistic electrons and positrons hit the surrounding supernova remnant or interstellar medium at a shock front. The Vela pulsar wind nebula is powered by a young pulsar (B0833-45, age 11 kyr) and located inside an extended structure called Vela X, itself inside the supernova remnant. Previous X-ray observations revealed two prominent arcs, bisected by a jet and counter jet. Radio maps have shown high linear polarization of 60 per cent in the outer regions of the nebula. Here we report X-ray observation of the inner part of the nebula, where polarization can exceed 60 per cent at the leading edge, which approaches the theoretical limit of what can be produced by synchrotron emission. We infer that, in contrast with the case of the supernova remnant, the electrons in the pulsar wind nebula are accelerated with little or no turbulence in a highly uniform magnetic field.\n\n", "2303.12432": "2023-03-22, **Inferring the progenitor mass-kinetic energy relation of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae from nebular spectroscopy**, Qiliang Fang et.al., [2303.12432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12432v1)\n\n The relation between the progenitor mass and the kinetic energy of the explosion is a key toward revealing the explosion mechanism of stripped-envelope (SE) core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe). Here, we present a method to derive this relation using the nebular spectra of SESNe, based on the correlation between the [O~I]/[Ca~II], which is an indicator of the progenitor mass, and the width of [O~I], which measures the expansion velocity of the oxygen-rich material. To explain the correlation, the kinetic energy ($E\\_{\\rm K}$) is required to be positively correlated with the progenitor mass as represented by the CO core mass ($M\\_{\\rm CO}$). We demonstrate that SNe IIb/Ib and SNe Ic/Ic-BL follow the same $M\\_{\\rm CO}$-$E\\_{\\rm K}$ scaling relation, which suggests the helium-rich and helium-deficient SNe share the same explosion mechanism. The $M\\_{\\rm CO}$-$E\\_{\\rm K}$ relation derived in this work is compared with the ones from early phase observations. The results are largely in good agreement. Combined with early phase observation, the method presented in this work provides a chance to scan through the ejecta from the outermost region to the dense inner core, which is important to reveal the global properties of the ejecta and constrain the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.\n\n"}}
