Despite huge efforts on understanding the main ingredients triggering such explosions, we still lack of compelling evidences for the precise mechanism driving those phenomena. They are expected to produce gravitational waves due to asymmetric mass motions in the collapsing core, and emit in the meanwhile neutrinos as a result of the interactions in their high-density environment. The combination of these two cosmic messengers can provide a unique probe to study the inner engine of these processes and unveil the explosion mechanism. Among the possible detectable signature, standing accretion shock instabilities (SASI) are particularly relevant in this context as they establish a direct connection between gravitational wave emission and the outcoming neutrino flux. In this work, Hilbert-Huang transform is applied to a selected sample of 3D numerical simulations, with the aim of identifying SASI contribution and extract its instantaneous frequency. The performance of the method is evaluated in the context of Einstein Telescope.\n\n", "2510.17583": "2025-10-20, **Leptonic first-row correlation and non-unitarity waiting for direct JUNO and Daya Bay precision tests**, Zhi-zhong Xing et.al., [2510.17583v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17583v1)\n\n We conjecture that there exists a remarkable correlation among the three elements in the first row of the $3\\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$: $\\|U^{}\\_{e1}\\|^2 = 2 \\left(\\|U^{}\\_{e2}\\|^2 + \\|U^{}\\_{e3}\\|^2\\right)$, which holds even though $U$ is non-unitary in the canonical seesaw mechanism.

To mitigate radioactivity from surrounding rock and enable cosmic muon tagging, its central detector is immersed in a Water Cherenkov Detector (WCD) containing 40~ktons of ultrapure water instrumented with 2400 20-inch micro-channel plate photomultiplier tubes. Stringent radiopurity requirements mandate a radon concentration below 10 ~mBq/m$^3$ in the WCD. To achieve this, we developed a two-stage (ground and underground) ultrapure water system with 100~t/h production capacity, integrating a five-stage degassing membrane for radon removal. A novel microbubble technique was implemented to optimize the degassing membranes' radon removal efficiency. The synergistic combination of the microbubble technology and the multistage degassing membranes achieved a radon removal efficiency exceeding 99.9\\%, reducing the system's output to 0.61 $\\pm$ 0.50~mBq/m$^3$ in recirculation mode, surpassing design specifications and establishing world-leading performance standards.

Among the GNI couplings, the scalar contributions remain more weakly constrained, while tensor interactions yield the strongest limits.

We have simulated proton-target interactions and optimize the resulting neutrino fluxes for water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS) detectors located at distinct baselines of 900 km and at 2900 km.

We consider both uncoupled and coupled cosmological scenarios. In the latter case, the coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm, with the dissipation coefficient assumed to be either constant or variable. The evolution equations of our coupled and uncoupled cosmological models are written in the form of autonomous systems, whose stability is studied using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. For this analysis, the only requirement imposed on the phantom scalar-field potential is that a specific dynamical variable, defined in terms of the potential and its derivative, must be invertible. We show that the uncoupled phantom cosmological model cannot accommodate any accelerated scaling solution, while such solutions do exist in the coupled scenario, for both constant and variable dissipation coefficients. Although there is a limitation to these scaling solutions $-$ specifically, the current stage of accelerated expansion is not preceded by a long enough matter-dominated era $-$ our results show that the existence of a direct coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter yields great potential for addressing the cosmic coincidence problem.\n\n", "2510.17704": "2025-10-20, **Einstein gravity extended by a scale covariant scalar field with Bekenstein term and dynamical mass generation**, Erhard Scholz et.al., [2510.17704v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17704v1)\n\n Under carefully chosen assumptions a single general relativistic scalar field is able to induce MOND-like dynamics in the weak field approximation of the Einstein frame (gauge) and to modify the light cone structure accordingly. This is shown by a Lagrangian model formulated in the framework of integrable Weyl geometry. It contains a Bekenstein-type (``aquadratic'') term and a second order term generating additional mass energy for the scalar field. Both are switched on only if the gradient of the scalar field is spacelike and below a MOND-typical threshold, like in the superfluid model of Berezhiani/Khoury. The mass term induces non-negligible energy and pressures of the scalar field and leads to gravitational light deflection compatible with MOND-ian free fall trajectories. In the weak field (Newton-Milgrom) approximation the Bekenstein term implies a deep MOND equation for the scalar field. In this model the external field effect of the MOND approach has to be reconsidered. This has important consequences for hierarchical systems like clusters, which may suffice for explaining their dynamics without additional dark matter.\n\n", "2510.17682": "2025-10-20, **Real-Time Readout System Design for the BULLKID-DM Experiment: Enhancing Dark Matter Search Capabilities**, T.

The MKIDs on each wafer are coupled to a single transmission line and read using a frequency division multiplexing approach by the room-temperature data acquisition.

To properly account for the Coulomb singularity that arises in the QED sector near threshold, we introduce the resummed cross section based on the Sommerfeld factor.

As before, CSM interaction is found to boost the UV brightness and shorten the optical rise time if compact. Higher ionization (e.g., as seen with OVI3820A) is obtained for more compact CSM, and is maximum for explosions in a vacuum. CSM interaction also diversifies the spectral evolution as seen in line profile morphology, with electron-scattering broadening dominating during the IIn phase. In the absence of CSM, Doppler broadening dominates immediately after shock breakout and leads to strongly blueshifted emission in lines such as HeII4686A or CIV5805A.

However, the rarity of transient events and the extensive human labeling required for a large number of samples pose significant challenges in constructing training datasets for RB classification. Given these challenges, point source injection techniques, which inject simulated point sources into optical images, provide a promising solution. This paper presents the first detailed comparison of different point source injection strategies and their effects on classification performance within a simulation-to-reality framework. To this end, we first construct various training datasets based on Random Injection (RI), Near Galaxy Injection (NGI), and a combined approach by using the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network datasets. Subsequently, we train convolutional neural networks on simulated cutout samples and evaluate them on real, imbalanced datasets from gravitational wave follow-up observations for GW190814 and S230518h. Extensive experimental results show that RI excels at asteroid detection and bogus filtering but underperforms on transients occurring near galaxies (e.g., supernovae). In contrast, NGI is effective for detecting transients near galaxies but tends to misclassify variable stars as transients, resulting in a high false positive rate. The combined approach effectively handles these trade-offs, thereby balancing between detection rate and false positive rate. Our results emphasize the importance of point source injection strategy in developing robust RB classifiers for transient (or multi-messenger) follow-up campaigns.\n\n"}}
