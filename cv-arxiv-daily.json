The integer weight polyharmonic Maa{\\ss} forms of level $N$ can be arranged into multipltets of the homogeneous finite modular group $\\Gamma'\\_N$.

This model can accommodate the experimental data for both normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings. We further extend this model to include quarks, so that the masses and mixing parameters of both quark and lepton sectors can be successfully described in terms of only thirteen real free parameters. It is the modular invariant model with the smallest number of free parameters so far, only normal ordering neutrino mass is viable after including quarks, and the correlations among the input parameters and flavor observables are analyzed.\n\n", "2506.19355": "2025-06-24, **Assessing the accuracy of the GENIE event generator with electron scattering data: Reduced cross section and nuclear transparency**, A.

Irrespective of the type of interaction the distorted spectral function is determined mainly by intrinsic properties of the target and the ejected nucleon interaction with residual nucleus. Thus the reduced cross sections of the neutrino and electron scattering on nuclei as functions of nucleon missing momentum and energy are similar up to Coulomb corrections. Here we demonstrate the utility of this approach by benchmarking the GENIE neutrino event generator against a broad set of semi-exclusive electron scattering data for carbon target. We observe persistent disagreements between the generator predictions and data in the range of nucleon missing momenta less than 80 MeV/c. The approach presented in this paper provide a great opportunity to test better the accuracy of nuclear models of quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, employed in neutrino event generators.\n\n", "2506.19354": "2025-06-24, **Torsional modulation of atmospheric neutrino oscillation**, Riya Barick et.al., [2506.19354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19354v1)\n\n Fermions act as sources of spacetime torsion. However, this torsion is non-dynamical and can be eliminated using its equations of motion. The resulting theory features an effective four-fermion interaction in a torsion-free background. Generically this interaction is non-universal and violates parity. When neutrinos propagate through matter, they experience the effect of this geometrical interaction, which is similar to the MSW effect, but diagonal in the mass basis. Since this quartic interaction term varies linearly with matter density, its effect will be more prominent for atmospheric neutrinos specially for upward going atmospheric neutrinos. We investigate the effect of spacetime geometry on $\\nu\\_\\mu \\to \\nu\\_\\tau$ and $\\nu\\_\\mu \\to \\nu\\_e$ conversion probability and $\\nu\\_\\mu$ survival probability, by solving the Schr\\\"odinger equation using the PREM density profile of the Earth.

In this work, we employ CosmoSIS to perform a Bayesian study of the $\\nu$HDM model. Using the best-fit values of the posterior, the CMB power spectrum is reevaluated.

Focusing on three representative models, the Singlet-Doublet fermion model, its extension to a Two-Higgs-Doublet plus pseudoscalar sector (2HDM$+a$), and a dark $SU(3)$ gauge model, we systematically analyze the interplay between thermal freeze-out, direct detection blind spots, and radiative corrections. In each case, we identify viable regions of parameter space where the predicted dark matter relic abundance is consistent with observations while elastic scattering rates lie below current exclusion limits and, in some cases, but now always, below the neutrino floor. Loop-induced effects are shown to play a critical role, particularly in scenarios with suppressed tree-level interactions.

This allows the two-body decay of heavy RHN into $\\nu\\_R$ and ALP thereby generating a lepton asymmetry in $\\nu\\_R$ which later gets transferred to left-handed leptons via sizeable Yukawa coupling with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. The asymmetry in left-handed leptons is then converted into baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. The lepton number violation by heavy RHN also induces a one-loop Majorana mass of $\\nu\\_R$ rendering the light neutrinos to be Majorana fermions. Successful leptogenesis constrain the parameter space in terms of RHN mass and axion decay constant. This has interesting consequences for both ALP and QCD axion DM parameter space within reach of several ongoing and near future experiments. We also propose a Dirac version of this scenario without any total lepton number violation. This leads to a long-lived asymmetric Dirac fermion contributing partially to DM thereby opening up more parameter space for ALP.

Certain properties of neutrinos remain difficult to measure, including their masses, their CP violation properties, and whether or not they are their own antiparticles. Additionally, there have been several anomalous results in neutrino experiments which remain unexplained. MicroBooNE was built in order to study these anomalous results using a more capable detector technology, the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber. Specifically, MicroBooNE is able to search for an anomalous excess of low energy electromagnetic showers, which was previously observed by the MiniBooNE experiment. In particular, MicroBooNE is able to study whether the excess could consist of electron showers or photon showers. In this thesis, I describe a search for this anomalous excess by targeting neutral current Delta radiative decays, the largest expected source of single photons in MicroBooNE. We observe data consistent with our nominal expectation, but cannot rule out all potential sources of additional single photon events, particularly those with no visible proton activity.

We perform a disk-halo decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as or better than the other profiles in >65% of the sample.

The stellar- and concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar, while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z systems are denser than those of local galaxies.

Typically, the detection of wave-like DM involves quantum sensors, such as qubits or cavities. The phase of the sensors is usually discarded as the value of the phase itself is not physically meaningful. However, the difference of the phase between the sensors contains the information of the velocity and direction of the DM wind. We propose a measurement protocol to extract this information from the sensors using quantum states. Our method does not require specific experimental setups and can be applied to any type of DM detector as long as the data from the detectors can be taken quantum mechanically.

Cosmic voids are vast underdense regions in the cosmic web that encode crucial information about structure formation, the composition of the Universe, and its expansion history. Due to their lower density, these regions are less affected by non-linear gravitational dynamics, making them suitable candidates for analysis using semi-analytic methods. Aims. We assess the accuracy of the PINOCCHIO code, a fast tool for generating dark matter halo catalogs based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, in modeling the statistical properties of cosmic voids. We validate this approach by comparing the resulting void statistics measured from PINOCCHIO to those obtained from N-body simulations. Methods. We generate a set of simulations using PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, assuming a fiducial cosmology and varying the resolution. For a given resolution, the simulations share the same initial conditions between the different simulation codes. Snapshots are saved at multiple redshifts for each simulation and post-processed using the watershed void finder VIDE to identify cosmic voids. For each simulation code, we measure the following statistics: void size function, void ellipticity function, core density function, and the void radial density profile. We use these statistics to quantify the accuracy of PINOCCHIO relative to OpenGADGET3 in the context of cosmic voids. Results. We find agreement for all void statistics at better than 2{\\sigma} between PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, with no systematic difference in redshift trends.

DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles.

This observation implies that the rate of proper time is not constant, as assumed in the standard FLRW metric, but instead is time-dependent. Consequently, the commonly used FLRW metric should be replaced by a more general framework, known as the Conformal Cosmology (CC) metric, to properly account for cosmic time dilation. The CC metric incorporates both spatial expansion and time dilation during cosmic evolution. As a result, it is necessary to distinguish between comoving and proper (physical) time, similar to the distinction made between comoving and proper distances. In addition to successfully explaining cosmic time dilation, the CC metric offers several further advantages: (1) it preserves Lorentz invariance, (2) it maintains the form of Maxwell's equations as in Minkowski space-time, (3) it eliminates the need for dark matter and dark energy in the Friedmann equations, and (4) it successfully predicts the expansion and morphology of spiral galaxies in agreement with observations.\n\n", "2506.19096": "2025-06-23, **Constraining exotic high-$z$ reionization histories with Gaussian processes and the cosmic microwave background**, Hanyu Cheng et.al., [2506.19096v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19096v1)\n\n The large-angle polarization anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are generated by Thomson scattering of CMB photons off free electrons in the post-recombination Universe.

We perform a perturbative analysis for scalar (spin-0), electromagnetic (spin-1), and Dirac (spin-1/2) fields, deriving the associated effective potentials and showing how both the dark halo and CSs alter field propagation and potential barriers.

Notably, the $\\mu < 0$ scenario yields a broader allowed parameter space, including for the first time sbottom-neutralino coannihilation solutions in GmSUGRA, which are absent for $\\mu > 0$. While the Higgs-pole and $Z$-pole regions for $\\mu > 0$ are largely excluded by the current LZ bounds, substantial viable regions remain for $\\mu < 0$. Gluino coannihilation scenarios are strongly constrained by the current LHC data. The characteristic mass ranges of interest include sbottoms (0.7-1.3~TeV), stops (up to 1.0~TeV for $\\mu > 0$ and 1.3~TeV for $\\mu < 0$), staus and charginos (up to 1.5~TeV), and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons in the $A$-funnel (0.4-1.4~TeV). Moreover, the supersymmetric contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment remain within a $2\\sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction. And our findings suggest that significant portions of the parameter space can be probed at the future LHC SUSY searches and upcoming dark matter direct detection experiments.\n\n", "2506.18411": "2025-06-23, **A new Limit for Axion Dark Matter with SPACE**, M.

Using Magellan/MIKE, VLT/X-shooter, and WHT/ISIS high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that this fast gas appears to probe the dominant feedback mechanisms linked to LyC escape. We find that in 14 galaxies, the wings are best fit with power laws with slopes -3.5 to -1.6, with four others best fit by Gaussians of width ~300 km/s; the remaining eight show ambiguous wing morphologies. Gaussian wings are found only at low O32 = [O III]5007/[O II]3726,3729 and high metallicity, while power-law wings span the full range of these parameters. The general evidence suggests a dual-mode paradigm for LyC escape: radiation-driven superwinds traced by power-law wings and supernova-driven feedback traced by Gaussian wings. For the former, the < 3 Myr-old, pre-supernova stellar population correlates with more luminous, faster winds. The data also show that radiation-driven wind parameters like wind luminosity and power-law slope depend on the UV luminosity more than the optically thick covering fraction, consistent with ``picket-fence\" radiative transfer. Observed wing slope values flatten with both escaping LyC luminosity and higher extinction, while still preserving the anticorrelation between these two quantities. Additionally, the differential between red and blue slopes implies that extinction and dense gas are centrally concentrated relative to the wind emission. Overall, our results show that power-law emission-line wings probe LyC-driven winds and LyC escape in metal-poor starbursts.\n\n", "2506.19460": "2025-06-24, **The Crab Nebula at subarcsecond resolution with the International LOFAR Telescope**, M. Arias et.al., [2506.19460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19460v1)\n\n We present International LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Telescope (ILT) observations of the Crab Nebula, the remnant of a core-collapse supernova explosion observed by astronomers in 1054. The field of the Crab Nebula was observed between 120 and 168 MHz as part of the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), and the data were re-processed to include the LOFAR international stations to create a high angular resolution ($0.43'' \\times 0.28''$) map at a central frequency of 145 MHz. Combining the ILT map with archival centimeter-range observations of the Nebula with the Very Large Array (VLA) and LOFAR data at 54 MHz, we become sensitive to the effects of free-free absorption against the synchrotron emission of the pulsar wind nebula. This absorption is caused by the ionised filaments visible in optical and infrared data of the Crab Nebula, which are the result of the pulsar wind nebula expanding into the denser stellar ejecta that surrounds it and forming Rayleigh-Taylor fingers. The LOFAR observations are sensitive to two components of these filaments: their dense cores, which show electron densities of $\\gtrsim1,000$ cm$^{-3}$, and the diffuse envelopes, with electron densities of $\\sim50-250$ cm$^{-3}$. The denser structures have widths of $\\sim0.03$ pc, whereas the diffuse component is at one point as large as $0.2$ pc. The morphology of the two components is not always the same.

One such measurement that has been largely overlooked is that of the elemental abundances, which potentially provide insights into the origin of the ejected material. Using the Chandra/HETG grating spectrometer we measure and present elemental abundances in four low-mass X-ray binaries. We compare two measurement methods. One is by fitting line series of individual ions and reconstructing the absorption measure distribution (AMD), and the other is a global fit with one or two individual ionization components. All outflows feature a steep AMD strongly favoring high ionization degrees. The present abundances are consistent with previous works suggesting the abundances in the outflows are non-solar. We find a tentative trend of increasing abundances with atomic number, which fits some core-collapse supernova models, but no exact match to a specific one.\n\n", "2506.19163": "2025-06-23, **The DECam MAGIC Survey: Spectroscopic Follow-up of the Most Metal-Poor Stars in the Distant Milky Way Halo**, Vinicius M.

The spectroscopic data confirms the accuracy of the photometric metallicities and allows for the determination of chemical abundances for 16 elements, from carbon to barium. The program stars have chemical abundances consistent with this metallicity range. A kinematic/dynamical analysis suggests that all program stars belong to the distant Milky Way halo population (heliocentric distances 35 < dhelio/kpc < 55), including three with high-energy orbits that might have been associated with the Magellanic system and one, J0026-5445, having parameters consistent with being a member of the Sagittarius stream. The remaining two stars show kinematics consistent with the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus dwarf galaxy merger. J0433-5548, with [Fe/H]=-4.12, is a carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor star, with [C/Fe]=+1.73. This star is believed to be a bona fide second-generation star, and its chemical abundance pattern was compared with yields from metal-free supernova models. Results suggest that J0433-5548 could have been formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single supernova explosion from a ~11Mo star in the early universe. The successful identification of such objects demonstrates the reliability of photometric metallicity estimates, which can be used for target selection and statistical studies of faint targets in the Milky Way and its satellite population.

This observation implies that the rate of proper time is not constant, as assumed in the standard FLRW metric, but instead is time-dependent. Consequently, the commonly used FLRW metric should be replaced by a more general framework, known as the Conformal Cosmology (CC) metric, to properly account for cosmic time dilation. The CC metric incorporates both spatial expansion and time dilation during cosmic evolution. As a result, it is necessary to distinguish between comoving and proper (physical) time, similar to the distinction made between comoving and proper distances. In addition to successfully explaining cosmic time dilation, the CC metric offers several further advantages: (1) it preserves Lorentz invariance, (2) it maintains the form of Maxwell's equations as in Minkowski space-time, (3) it eliminates the need for dark matter and dark energy in the Friedmann equations, and (4) it successfully predicts the expansion and morphology of spiral galaxies in agreement with observations.\n\n", "2506.19071": "2025-06-23, **A Late-time Radio Survey of Type Ia-CSM Supernovae with the Very Large Array**, Olivia Griffith et.al., [2506.19071v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19071v1)\n\n Type Ia-CSM supernovae (SNe) are a rare and peculiar subclass of thermonuclear SNe characterized by emission lines of hydrogen or helium, indicative of a high-density circumstellar medium (CSM). Their implied mass-loss rates of $\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-1}$ M$\\_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (assuming $\\mathrm{ \\sim 100 \\ km\\ s^{-1}}$ winds) from optical observations are generally in excess of values observed in realistic SN Ia progenitors. In this paper, we present an independent study of CSM densities around a sample of 29 archival Ia-CSM SNe using radio observations with the Very Large Array at 6 GHz. Motivated by the late ($\\sim$2 yr) radio detection of the Ia-CSM SN 2020eyj, we observed old ($>$1 yr) SNe where we are more likely to see the emergent synchrotron emission that may have been suppressed earlier by free-free absorption by the CSM. We do not detect radio emission down to 3$\\sigma$ limits of $\\sim$35 $\\mu$Jy in our sample. The only radio-detected candidate in our sample, SN 2022esa, was likely mis-classified as a Ia-CSM with early spectra, and appears more consistent with a peculiar Ic based on later-epochs.

We find that it is too faint to be a globular cluster, young star cluster, red supergiant star, or a giant star near the tip of the red giant branch (RGB). It is instead consistent with a red giant near the RGB \"clump\" or a massive ($\\gtrsim20$ M$\\_{\\odot}$) main sequence star, although the latter explanation is less likely. The source is too bright to be a supernova remnant, Crab-like pulsar wind nebula, or isolated magnetar.

Recent measurements of cosmic rays with the CALET and the DAMPE experiments have revealed a bump-like new feature in the proton and helium spectra in the energy range of ~ (1-100) TeV/nucleon. The origin of the feature is not clearly understood. In this paper, considering an improved and more detailed analysis than previous works, and using an updated age and distance estimates of nearby supernova remnants along with an energy-dependent escape process for cosmic rays from the remnants, we show that the spectral bump can be explained by the contribution of cosmic rays from the nearby supernova remnants, in particular, the Vela remnant. We also show that the contribution from the nearby remnants agrees well with the observed spectra of the heavier cosmic-ray elements from carbon to iron as well as with the measured all-particle cosmic-ray spectrum beyond the knee region when combined with a background flux of cosmic rays originating from distant supernova remnants.\n\n", "2506.18518": "2025-06-23, **The undetectable fraction of core-collapse supernovae in luminous infrared galaxies**, I.

This fraction of undetected CCSNe, unaccounted for by typical extinction corrections, is an important factor in determining CCSN rates, in particular at redshifts $z \\gtrsim 1$, where LIRGs dominate the cosmic star formation. Our aim is to derive a robust estimate for the undetected fraction of CCSNe in LIRGs in the local Universe. Our study is based on the K-band multi-epoch SUNBIRD survey data set of a sample of eight LIRGs using the Gemini-North Telescope with the ALTAIR/NIRI laser guide star adaptive optics system. We used simulated SNe and a standard image subtraction method to determine limiting detection magnitudes for the data set. Subsequently, we used a Monte Carlo method to combine the limiting magnitudes with the survey cadence, and an adopted distribution of CCSN subtypes and their light curve evolution to determine SN detection probabilities. Lastly, we combined these probabilities with the intrinsic CCSN rates of the sample galaxies estimated based on their detailed radiative transfer modeling to derive the fraction of undetectable CCSNe in local LIRGs. For high angular resolution near-infrared surveys, we find an undetectable fraction of $66.0^{+8.6}\\_{-14.6}$\\%, assuming that CCSNe with host extinctions up to $A\\_V$ = 16 mag are detectable, corresponding to the most obscured CCSN discovered in our data set.

Finsler geometry generalizes Riemannian geometry by allowing the metric tensor to depend on position and an additional internal degree of freedom, typically represented by a vector field at each point of the spacetime manifold. We explore whether Finsler-type geometries can describe gravitational interaction and cosmological dynamics. In particular, we examine the Barthel connection and $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ geometries, where $\\alpha$ is a Riemannian metric and $\\beta$ is a one-form. For a specific construction of $\\beta$, the Barthel connection coincides with the Levi-Civita connection of the associated Riemann metric. We review gravitational field and cosmological evolution in three geometries: Barthel-Randers ($F = \\alpha + \\beta$), Barthel-Kropina ($F = \\alpha^2 \\beta$), and the conformally transformed Barthel-Kropina geometry. After presenting the mathematical foundations of Finslerian-type modified gravity theories, we derive generalized Friedmann equations in these geometries assuming a Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker type metric. We also present the matter-energy balance equations, interpreting them from the perspective of thermodynamics with particle creation. The cosmological properties of Barthel-Randers and Barthel-Kropina models are explored in detail. The additional geometric terms in these models can be interpreted as an effective dark energy component, generating an effective cosmological constant. Several cosmological solutions are compared with observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) using MCMC analysis. A comparison with the $\\Lambda$CDM model shows that Finslerian models fit observational data well, suggesting they offer a viable alternative to general relativity.\n\n"}}
