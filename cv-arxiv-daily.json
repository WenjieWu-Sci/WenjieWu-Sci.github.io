Developed primarily towards the direct detection of dark matter particles, experiments presently operating deep underground have reached target masses at the multi-tonne scale, energy thresholds around 1\\,keV and radioactivity-induced background rates similar to those from solar neutrinos. These unique properties, together with demonstrated stable operation over several years, allow for the exploration of new territory via high-sensitivity searches for a plethora of ultra-rare interactions. These include searches for particle dark matter, for second order weak decays, and the observation of astrophysical neutrinos. We first review some properties of xenon as a radiation detection medium and the operation principles of dual-phase Xe-TPCs together with their energy calibration and resolution. We then discuss the status of currently running experiments and of proposed next-generation projects, describing some of the technological challenges. We end by looking at their sensitivity to dark matter candidates, to second order weak decays and to solar and supernova neutrinos. Experiments based on dual-phase Xe-TPCs are difficult, and, like all good experiments, they are constantly pushed to their limits. Together with many other endeavours in astroparticle physics and cosmology they will continue to push at the borders of the unknown, hopefully to reveal profound new knowledge about our cosmos.\n\n", "2311.05224": "2023-11-09, **Measurement of the $D^{*}$ longitudinal polarization in $B^0\\to D^{*-}\u03c4^{+}\u03bd_\u03c4$ decays**, LHCb collaboration et.al., [2311.05224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05224v1)\n\n The longitudinal polarization fraction of the $D^{*}$ meson is measured in $B^0\\to D^{*-}\\tau^{+}\\nu\\_{\\tau}$ decays, where the $\\tau$ lepton decays to three charged pions and a neutrino, using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at center-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5 fb$^{-1}$.

In this study, we investigate the long-term evolution of Population III star clusters, including models with a primordial binary fraction of $f\\_{\\rm b}=0$ and 1, using the $N$-body simulation code \\textsc{petar}. We comprehensively examine the phenomenon of hierarchical triple black holes in the clusters, specifically focusing on the merging of their inner binary black holes (BBHs), with post-Newtonian correction, by using the \\textsc{tsunami} code. Our findings suggest a high likelihood of the inner BBHs containing IMBHs with masses on the order of $\\mathcal{O}(100)M\\_{\\odot}$, and as a result, their merger rate could be up to $0.1{\\rm Gpc}^{-3}{\\rm yr}^{-3}$.

The orbital eccentricities of some merging inner BBHs oscillate over time periodically, known as the Kozai-Lidov oscillation, due to dynamical perturbations. Furthermore, the merging inner BBHs tend to have highly eccentric orbits at low frequency range, some of them with low redshift would be detected by LISA/TianQin. In the higher frequency range, the merging inner BBHs across a wider redshift range would be detected by DECIGO/ET/CE/LIGO/KAGRA.\n\n", "2311.05366": "2023-11-09, **Cosmic mysteries and the hydrogen 21-cm line: bridging the gap with lunar observations**, Anastasia Fialkov et.al., [2311.05366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05366v1)\n\n The hydrogen 21-cm signal is predicted to be the richest probe of the young Universe including eras known as the cosmic Dark Ages, the Cosmic Dawn when the first star and black hole formed, and the Epoch of Reionization.

In this opinion piece, we discuss the potential scientific merit of lunar observations of the 21-cm signal and their advantages over more affordable terrestrial efforts. The moon is a prime location for radio cosmology which will enable precision observations of the low-frequency radio sky. The uniqueness of such observations is that they will provide an unparalleled opportunity to test cosmology and the nature of dark matter using the Dark Ages 21-cm signal.

To do so, we first interpolate the observational Hubble data to extract cosmic bounds over the (reduced) Hubble constant, $h\\_0$, and interpolate the angular diameter distances, $D(z)$, of the galaxy clusters, inferred from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, constraining the spatial curvature, $\\Omega\\_k$.

In the context of the Dark Dimension scenario, a natural candidate for dark matter in our universe is the excitations of a tower of massive spin-2 KK gravitons. These dark gravitons are produced in the early universe and decay to lighter KK gravitons during the course of cosmological evolution. The decay causes the average dark matter mass to decrease as the universe evolves. In addition, the kinetic energy liberated in each decay leads to a kick velocity for the dark matter particles leading to a suppression of structure formation. Using current CMB (Planck), BAO and cosmic shear (KiDS-1000) data, we put a bound on the dark matter kick velocity today $v\\_\\mathrm{today} \\leq 2.2 \\times 10^{-4} c$ at 95\\% CL. This leads to rather specific regions of parameter space for the dark dimension scenario.

We develop a denoising diffusion super-resolution emulator for large cosmological simulation volumes. Our approach is based on the image-to-image Palette diffusion model, which we modify to 3 dimensions. Our super-resolution emulator is trained to perform outpainting, and can thus upgrade very large cosmological volumes from LR to HR using an iterative outpainting procedure.

Conventionally, in the context of misalignment mechanism, the non-thermally produced ALPs happen to stay frozen due to Hubble friction initially and at a later stage, they begin to oscillate (before matter-radiation equality) at characteristic frequencies defined by their masses and behaving like cold dark matter. In this work, we study the influence of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), through a higher order Higgs portal interaction, on the evolution of ALPs. Such an interaction is found to contribute partially to the ALP's mass during EWSB, thereby modifying oscillation frequencies during EWSB as well as impacting upon the existing correlation between the scale of symmetry breaking and their masses.

Particularly, young remnants (aged less than 5000 years) hold immense value as they can offer crucial insights into the inner processes of the supernova (SN) engine, revealing details about nucleosynthetic yields and large-scale asymmetries arising from the early stages of the explosion. Furthermore, these remnants also bear characteristics that may reflect the nature of their progenitor stars and the interactions between the remnants and the surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM), shaped by the progenitor's mass-loss history. Hence, investigating the connection between young SNRs, parent SNe, and progenitor massive stars can be of paramount importance to delve into the physics of SN engines, and to investigate the final stages of massive star evolution and the elusive mechanisms governing their mass loss. In this contribution, I review recent advances in modeling the path from massive stars to SNe and SNRs achieved by our team.

Our focus centers on a time-varying dark energy (DE) model that introduces a rapid transition in the equation of state, at a specific redshift, $z\\_a$, from the baseline, $\\Lambda = -1$, value to the present value, $w\\_0$, through the implementation of a sigmoid function. The constraints obtained for the DE sigmoid phenomenological parametrization have broad applicability for dynamic DE models that invoke late-time physics. Our analysis indicates that the sigmoid model provides a slightly better, though not statistically significant, fit to the SNe Pantheon+ data compared to the standard LCDM alone. The fit results, assuming a flat geometry and maintaining $\\Omega\\_m$ constant at the 2018-Planck value of $0.3153$, are as follows: $H\\_0 = 73.3^{+0.2}\\_{-0.6}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $w\\_{0} = -0.95^{+0.15}\\_{-0.02}$, $z\\_a = 0.8 \\pm 0.46$. The errors represent statistical uncertainties only. The available SN dataset lacks sufficient statistical power to distinguish between the baseline LCDM and the alternative sigmoid models. A feature of interest offered by the sigmoid model is that it identifies a specific redshift, $z\\_a = 0.8$, where a potential transition in the equation of state could have occurred. The sigmoid model does not favor a DE in the phantom region ($w\\_0 < -1$). Further constraints to the dynamic DE model have been obtained using CMB data to compute the distance to the last scattering surface. While the sigmoid DE model does not completely resolve the $H\\_0$ tension, it offers a transition mechanism that can still play a role alongside other potential solutions.\n\n"}}
