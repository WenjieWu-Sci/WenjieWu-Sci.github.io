The results show that the beamline provides a meson beam compatible with the operation of the spectrometer, and delivers a neutrino flux sufficient to collect neutrino samples with a size comparable with similar experiments and with other un-tagged long-baseline neutrino experimental proposals.\n\n", "2401.16957": "2024-01-30, **Impact of Hot Inner Crust on The Properties of Hot Compact Stars**, Clara Dehman et.al., [2401.16957v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16957v1)\n\n We have conducted a study on the thermal properties of the recently developed nuclear energy density functional known as BCPM. This functional is founded on microscopic calculations that incorporate the realistic Argonne $v\\_{18}$ potential along with Urbana-type three-body forces. BCPM has demonstrated success in describing finite nuclei and cold neutron stars. However, investigating the properties of hot $\\beta$-stable matter under both neutrino-free and neutrino-trapped scenarios is vital for astrophysical applications. In this study, we investigate the BCPM equation of state for $\\beta$-stable, neutrino-free matter at finite temperatures, taking into consideration the hot inner crust and applying the frozen correlation approximation. Such an equation of state holds significant importance for hot compact objects, such as the final result of a binary neutron star merger event. Our exploration has unveiled the presence of cluster regions, persisting up to a temperature of approximately $7.2$ MeV, denoted as the limiting temperature. Beyond this limiting temperature, clusters are not anticipated to manifest. At temperatures below the limiting threshold, clusters within the inner crust are encompassed by uniform matter with varying densities, facilitating the distinction between the higher and lower transition density branches. Furthermore, we have computed mass-radius relationship, while assuming an isothermal profile for neutron star matter at diverse temperature values. Our findings indicate that the results of the hot inner crust substantially influences the mass-radius relationship, resulting in the formation of larger, more inflated neutron stars. A thorough analysis of the hot inner crust is therefore essential for the study of proto-neutron stars.\n\n", "2401.16864": "2024-01-30, **Revisiting series expansions of neutrino oscillation and decay probabilities in matter**, Jesper Gr\u00f6nroos et.al., [2401.16864v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16864v1)\n\n We present analytic expressions for three-flavor neutrino oscillations in presence of invisible neutrino decay and matter effects.

In these models, the ambient DM behaves as a new classical source in Maxwell's equations, which can excite potentially detectable electromagnetic (EM) fields in the laboratory. We describe a new proposal for using integrated photonics to search for such DM candidates with masses in the 0.1 eV - few eV range. This approach offers a wide range of wavelength-scale devices like resonators and waveguides that can enable a novel and exciting experimental program. In particular, we show how refractive index-modulated resonators, such as grooved or periodically-poled microrings, or patterned slabs, support EM modes with efficient coupling to DM. When excited by the DM, these modes can be read out by coupling the resonators to a waveguide that terminates on a micron-scale-sized single photon detector, such as a single pixel of an ultra-quiet charge-coupled device or a superconducting nanowire.

In this paper, we perform a dedicated analysis of the spectrum of axions radiated from strings based on large scale numerical simulations of the cosmological evolution of the Peccei-Quinn field on a static lattice. Making full use of the massively parallel code and computing resources, we executed the simulations with up to $11264^3$ lattice sites, which allows us to improve our understanding of the dependence on the parameter controlling the string tension and thus give a more accurate extrapolation of the numerical results. We found that there are several systematic effects that have been overlooked in previous works, such as the dependence on the initial conditions, contaminations due to oscillations in the spectrum, and discretisation effects, some of which could explain the discrepancy in the literature. We confirmed the trend that the spectral index of the axion emission spectrum increases with the string tension, but did not find a clear evidence of whether it continues to increase or saturates to a constant at larger values of the string tension due to the severe discretisation effects. Taking this uncertainty into account and performing the extrapolation with a simple power law assumption on the spectrum, we find that the dark matter mass is predicted in the range of $m\\_a \\approx 95$-$450\\,\\mu\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n", "2401.17055": "2024-01-30, **Ultralight scalar and axion dark matter detection with atom interferometers**, Wei Zhao et.al., [2401.17055v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17055v1)\n\n The detection of dark matter is a challenging problem in modern physics.

We focus on particle production arising from spacetime perturbations, which are induced by inflaton fluctuations during the quasi-de Sitter stage of inflation. In particular, we construct the first order Lagrangian describing interaction between inhomogeneities and the spectator field, quantifying superhorizon particle production during slow-roll. We then compare this mechanism with gravitational particle production associated with an instantaneous transition from inflation to the radiation dominated era. We show that the amount of particles obtained from perturbations is typically non-negligible and it is significantly enhanced on super-Hubble scales by the nonadiabatic inflationary expansion.

The object is located at the Galactic anti-center, and its 3 deg size classifies it among the largest SNRs ever detected in X-rays. Overall, the X-ray emission morphology as observed with eROSITA is fully confined within the boundaries of both radio synchrotron and H$\\alpha$ emission, except for the Western edge of the remnant where radio and H$\\alpha$ emission appears to extend further to the West compared to X-rays.

Such stars explode as type I b/c supernovae, which have been observed in association with long gamma ray bursts (GRBs). The core of the star is potentially forming a black hole, which is embedded in a dense, rotating, and possibly highly magnetized envelope. We study the process of collapse using General Relativistic MHD simulations, and we account for the growth of the black hole mass and its spin, as well as related evolution of the spacetime metric. We find that some particular configurations of the initial black hole spin, the content of angular momentum in the stellar core, and the magnetic field configuration and its strength, are favored for producing a bright electromagnetic transient (i.e., a gamma ray burst). On the other hand, most of the typical configurations studied in our models do not lead to a transient electromagnetic explosion and will end up in a direct collapse, accompanied by some residual variability induced by changing accretion rate. We also study the role of self-gravity in the stellar core and quantify the relative strength of the interfacial instabilities, such as Self-Gravity Interfacial (SGI) instability and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT), which may account for the production of an inhomogeneous structure, including spikes and bubbles, through the inner radii of the collapsing core (inside $\\sim 200~r\\_{g}$). %Furthermore, we investigate the axisymmetric modes of gravitational instability based on the generalized Toomre parameter.

We then demonstrate applications of our method in the cosmological context, that include serving as a model-independent tool for consistency checks for other datasets like baryon acoustic oscillations, calibration of high-redshift datasets such as gamma ray bursts, use as a model-independent mock catalog generator for future probes, etc. Our analysis advocates for interesting yet cautious consideration of machine learning applications in these contexts.\n\n", "2401.16676": "2024-01-30, **Cosmological Prediction of the CSST Ultra Deep Field Type Ia Supernova Photometric Survey**, Minglin Wang et.al., [2401.16676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16676v1)\n\n Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) as a standard candle is an ideal tool to measure cosmic distance and expansion history of the Universe. Here we investigate the SN Ia photometric measurement in the China Space Station Telescope Ultra Deep Field (CSST-UDF) survey, and study the constraint power on the cosmological parameters, such as the equation of state of dark energy. The CSST-UDF survey is expected to cover a 9 deg$^2$ sky area in two years with 60 exposures. The magnitude limit can reach $i\\simeq26$ AB mag for 5$\\sigma$ point source detection. We generate light curve mock data for SNe Ia and different types of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), based on the relevant SN SED templates, natural generation rates, luminosity functions, CSST instrumental design and survey strategy. After selecting high-quality data and fitting the light curves, we derive the light curve parameters and identify CCSNe as contamination, resulting in $\\sim2200$ SNe with a $\\sim7\\%$ CCSN contamination rate. We adopt a calibration method similar to Chauvenet's criterion, and apply it to the distance modulus data to further reduce the contamination. We find that this method is effective and can suppress the contamination fraction to $\\sim3.5\\%$ with 2012 SNe Ia and 73 CCSNe. About 16\\% of SNe Ia are at $z>1$ in the final CSST-UDF SN sample. By checking the cosmological constraints, the result derived from this calibrated SN sample is in good agreement with that using the pure SN Ia sample. The constraint accuracies on $\\Omega\\_{\\rm M}$, $\\Omega\\_{\\Lambda}$ and $w$ are about $10\\%\\sim20\\%$, which is about two times better than the current SN surveys, and it could be further improved by a factor of $\\sim$1.4 if including the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the CSST spectroscopic survey. This indicates that CSST can provide accurate measurements for the cosmic expansion history and the nature of dark energy.\n\n", "2401.16674": "2024-01-30, **Toward Data-Driven Subgrid-Scale Modeling of the Zel'dovich Deflagration-To-Detonation Mechanism in Dense Stellar Plasmas**, Brandon L. Gusto et.al., [2401.16674v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16674v1)\n\n A novel, data-driven model of deflagration-to-detonationtransition (DDT) is constructed for application to explosions of thermonuclear supernovae (SN Ia). The DDT mechanism has been suggested as the necessary physics process to obtain qualitative agreement between SN Ia observations and computational explosion models. This work builds upon a series of studies of turbulent combustion that develops during the final stages of the SN explosion. These studies suggest that DDT can occur in the turbulerized flame of the white dwarf via the Zel'dovich reactivity gradient mechanism when hotspots are formed. We construct a large database of direct numerical simulations that explore the parameter space of the Zel'dovich initiated detonation. We use this database to construct a neural network classifier for hotspots. The classifier is integrated into our supernova simulation code, FLASH/Proteus, and is used as the basis for a subgrid-scale model for DDT. The classifier is evaluated both in the training environment and in reactive turbulence simulations to verify its accuracy in realistic conditions.\n\n"}}
