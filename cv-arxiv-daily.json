This necessitates revisiting current cosmic ray interaction models. A new model proposed here involves cosmic ray interactions first in the wind shock shell of supergiant stars and second in the OB-Superbubble around supernovae. These stars, including red and blue supergiants, produce black holes and drive electric currents in winds and jets. Variability in these winds creates temporary electric fields that accelerate particles, resulting in steep spectra with synchrotron losses, and analogous hadron spectra produce a flat magnetic irregularity spectrum. This model matches AMS data, explaining cosmic ray spectra below 100 GV. The model predicts a secondary/primary ratio slope of -1/3 and a primary flux reduction below 100 GV relative to a power-law spectrum with slope +2. Key aspects are: a larger interaction column due to heavy element enrichment and a minor secondary contribution even for elements like He, C, and O, as indicated by the $^3$He/$^4$He ratio.

The $U(1)\\_X$ mixed gravitational anomaly-free condition necessitates that electrically neutral mirror bulk fermions couple to the normal neutrino field on the 3-brane, consistent with the boundary condition.

Intuitively, this kinematic limit corresponds to the long wavelength limit although a more precise description depends on the nature of the curved spacetime. To identify the topology, we reformulate the usual Bogoliubov computations as a type of SU(1,1) gauged differential equation and utilize a special gauge together with a discrete symmetry that naturally characterizes the dispersion relationship.

In addition to conventional astrophysical sources, dark matter may be a component of the IGRB. We combine our model of conventional astrophysical sources and of dark matter annihilation in distant galaxies, marginalizing over relevant uncertainties, to derive constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section, from the measured IGRB. In calculating the contribution from dark matter we include the flux from extragalactic halos and their substructure and also the subdominant contribution from Milky Way's halo at high galactic latitudes. The resulting constraints are competitive with the strongest current constraints from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

Given the empirical and theoretical evidence that young galaxies are dynamically hotter at higher redshifts, our results suggest that the high-$z$ JWST galaxies may not be cold discs but are dynamically warm/hot galaxies with flattened shapes driven by anisotropy.

The comparisons explicitly include the measurement uncertainty of each method in N4258, an oft-neglected but dominant term. Mean differences are ~0.03 mag, far smaller than the 0.18 mag \"Hubble tension.\" Combining all measures produces the strongest constraint yet on the linearity of HST Cepheid distances, 0.994+-0.010, ruling out distance-dependent bias or offset as the source of the tension at ~7 sigma. Yet, measurements of H0 from current JWST subsamples produce large sampling differences whose size and direction we can directly estimate from the full HST set. We show that Delta(H0)~2.5 km/s/Mpc between the CCHP JWST program and the full HST sample is entirely consistent with differences in sample selection. Combining all JWST samples produces a new, distance-limited set of 16 SNeIa at D<25 Mpc and more closely resembles the full sample thanks to \"reversion to the mean\" of larger samples.

Their lives can be significantly affected by three-body interactions, making it an important area of study in the context of massive star evolution. In this study we provide a statistical overview of the lives and final outcomes of destabilized massive triples. A population of initially stable triples with a massive primary star are evolved from the zero-age main sequence using the code TRES, which combines stellar evolution with orbit-averaged dynamics. The triples that become unstable are transferred to a direct N-body code where they are simulated until the system disintegrates. This excludes systems undergoing mass transfer, such that the instability is caused by stellar winds or supernovae. Two suites of N-body simulations are performed; one with gravity as the only interaction, and one with stellar evolution included. We find that collisions occur in 35 - 40% of systems, with the variation coming from whether stellar evolution is included. The collisions mainly involve two main sequence stars (70 - 78%) or a main sequence and post-main sequence star (13 - 28%). We estimate a Galactic rate of collisions due to massive triple destabilization at 1.1 - 1.3 events per Myr. Furthermore, we find that the process of destabilization often ends in the ejection of one of the stellar bodies, specifically for 31 - 40% of systems. The ejected bodies have typical velocities of around 6 km/s, with a tail stretching to 102 km/s. If we assume that 20% of massive stars are runaway stars, then 0.1% of runaways originate from triple destabilization. Overall, our simulations show that triple instability affects approximately 2% of massive triples. However, we estimate that up to ten times as many systems can become unstable due to mass transfer in the inner binary, and these system may end up ejecting bodies at higher velocities.\n\n", "2408.11014": "2024-08-20, **Identifying jittering-jet-shaped ejecta in the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant**, Dmitry Shishkin et.al., [2408.11014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11014v1)\n\n Analyzing images of the Cygnus Loop, a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant, in different emission bands, we identify a point-symmetrical morphology composed of three symmetry axes that we attribute to shaping by three pairs of jets. The main jet axis has an elongated S shape, appearing as a faint narrow zone in visible and UV. We term it the S-shaped hose, and the structure of three symmetry lines, the point-symmetric wind rose. The two other lines connect a protrusion (an ear or a bulge) with a hole on the opposite side of the center (a nozzle or a cavity), structures that we identify in the X-ray, UV, visible, IR, and/or radio images. There is a well-known blowout at the southern end of the S-shaped hose, and we identify a possible opposite blowout at the northern end of the S-shaped hose. The point-symmetrical morphology of the Cygnus Loop is according to the expectation of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, where several to few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions explode the star. The three pairs of jets that shaped the wind-rose structure of the Cygnus Loop are the last energetic pairs of this series of jets. Our study further supports the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe.\n\n", "2408.10981": "2024-08-20, **Local two-dimensional simulations of the ignition of a helium shell detonation on a white dwarf by an impacting stream**, Nethra Rajavel et.al., [2408.10981v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10981v1)\n\n The double detonation model is one of the prevalent explosion mechanisms of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) wherein an outer helium shell detonation triggers a core detonation in the white dwarf (WD). The dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation (D6) is the double detonation of the more massive WD in a binary WD system where the localized impact of the mass transfer stream from the companion sets off the initial helium shell detonation. To have high numerical resolution and control over the stream parameters, we have implemented a study of the local interaction of the stream with the WD surface in 2D. In cases with lower base density of the shell, the stream's impact can cause surface detonation soon after first impact. With higher base densities, after the stream hits the surface, hot material flows around the star and interacts with the incoming stream to produce a denser and narrower impact. Our results therefore show that (1) a directly impacting stream for both a relatively high resolution and for a range of stream parameters can produce a surface detonation, (2) thinner helium shells ignite more promptly via impact, doing so sooner, and (3) there are lower limits on ignition in both shell density and incoming stream speed with lower limits on density being well below those shown by other work to be required for normal appearing SN Ia. This supports stream ignition and therefore the D6 scenario, as a viable mechanism for normal SNe Ia.\n\n", "2408.10721": "2024-08-20, **Viewing the explosion models of type Ia supernovae via the insight from terrestrial cellular detonation**, Kazuya Iwata et.al., [2408.10721v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10721v1)\n\n The cellular structure is considered to be a key as a criterion in initiation, propagation, and quenching of terrestrial detonation. While a few studies on type Ia supernovae, which are known to involve detonation, have addressed the importance of the cellular structure, further detailed treatment will benefit enhanced understanding of the explosion outcomes. In the present study, we bridge this gap in the astrophysics and engineering fields, focusing on the detonation in a heliumrich white dwarf envelope as the triggering process for the so-called double-detonation model. The cellular structures are quantified via high-resolution two-dimensional simulations. We demonstrate that widely-accepted terrestrial-experimental criteria for quenching and initiation of detonation can indeed explain the results of previous hydrodynamic simulations very well. The present study highlights the potential of continuing to apply the insight from terrestrial detonation experiments to astrophysical problems, specifically the long unresolved problem of the explosion mechanism of type Ia supernovae.\n\n", "2408.10707": "2024-08-20, **High-redshift Cosmology by Gamma-Ray Bursts: an overview**, Giada Bargiacchi et.al., [2408.10707v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10707v1)\n\n Several correlations among Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) quantities, both in the prompt and afterglow emissions, have been established during the last decades, thus enabling the standardization of GRBs as cosmological probes. Since GRBs are observed up to redshift $z \\sim 9$, they represent a valuable tool to fill in the gap of information on the Universe evolution between the farthest type Ia supernovae and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation and to shed new light on the current challenging cosmological tensions. Without claiming for completeness, here we describe the state of the art of GRB correlations, their theoretical interpretations, and their cosmological applications both as standalone probes and in combination with other probes. In this framework, we pinpoint the importance of correcting the correlations for selection biases and redshift evolution to derive intrinsic relations, the assets of combining probes at different scales, and the need for the employment of the appropriate cosmological likelihood to precisely constrain cosmological parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize the benefits of the cosmographic approach to avoid any cosmological assumptions and the valuable applications of machine learning techniques to reconstruct GRB light curves and predict unknown GRB redshifts. Finally, we stress the relevance of all these factors, along with future observations, to definitely boost the power of GRBs in cosmology.\n\n", "2408.10704": "2024-08-20, **$\u039b$CDM model against cosmography: A possible deviation after DESI 2024**, Saeed Pourojaghi et.al., [2408.10704v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10704v1)\n\n In this study, we present an analysis of the standard flat-$\\Lambda$CDM model using a cosmographic approach, incorporating recent DESI BAO observations and Supernovae Type Ia catalogues (SNIa), including the DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+ compilations. We find full consistency between the standard model and the cosmographic approach when considering DESI BAO and SNIa catalogues independently. When combining DESI BAO with SNIa data, we examine the impact of the Planck prior on the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r\\_d$, and the Cepheid prior on the absolute magnitude, $M$. Applying the Planck prior on $r\\_d$ alone yields an $H\\_0$ value consistent with the Planck measurement, while applying the Cepheid prior on $M$ alone results in an $H\\_0$ value consistent with the SH0ES measurement. Without any priors, the $H\\_0$ value obtained has a large error margin, reconciling the Planck and SH0ES measurements. In all cases where individual priors are applied, we observe no significant tension between the flat-$\\Lambda$CDM model and the cosmographic approach. However, when both Planck and Cepheid priors are applied simultaneously, significant tensions arise between the model and cosmography. This tension is even more pronounced when excluding LRG1 and LRG2 from the DESI measurements. These results suggest that the standard model cannot simultaneously align with both high-redshift Planck CMB observations and local Cepheid measurements.\n\n", "2408.10560": "2024-08-20, **Optimizing the $L$-$\u03c3$ Relation of HII Galaxies for Improving Cosmological Application**, Jiaze Gao et.al., [2408.10560v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10560v1)\n\n The basic premise of using HII starburst galaxies (HIIGs) as cosmic \"standard candels\" is that there is a significant correlation between the H$\\beta$ luminosity ($L$) and the velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) of the ionized gas from HIIGs measurements, which can be called as the empirical $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation. However, the scaling $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation well-calibrated with the lower-redshift HIIGs is unfitted for the higher-redshift HIIGs. To solve this problem, we explore new relational expression for the $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation which should be suitable for both lower-redshift and higher-redshift HIIGs. After reconstructing the Hubble diagram with the Gaussian process (GP) method from the Pantheon+ supernovae Ia sample, we examine and compare six different revised formulas of $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation. Furthermore, we use the Bayesian evidence to compare the revised $L$ - $\\sigma$ relations with the analysis of a joint sample of 36 giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHRs) and 145 HIIGs. It turns out that the redshift-dependent bilinear correction and the quadratic $\\sigma$ based correction are significantly better than the others. Moreover, a quadratic $\\sigma$ based correction is the most supported one. It suggests that the appropriate corrections to the $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation should be considered when the HIIGs are used as a kind of cosmological probes.\n\n"}}
