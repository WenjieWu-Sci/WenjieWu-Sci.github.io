These data also reveal tension in the inferred matter density parameter -lower in DESI and higher in Planck- as well as a neutrino mass posterior that approaches the lower bounds permitted by oscillation experiments. In this work, we propose and test a conformal holographic DE (CHDE) model in which the DE density depends on a power law of the conformal time, characterized by an exponent (n). This formulation introduces a single additional parameter relative to LambdaCDM and reduces to it in the limit n = 0. We confront the CHDE model with BAO, CMB, and supernova datasets, following the same combinations used by DESI, and perform parameter inference under both flat and non-flat cosmologies. Our analyses show that LambdaCDM is not favored as the best-fit model when using CMB data alone or in joint analyses including BAO and SNla, and it is disfavored at the 4.4 sigma level for non-flat model and 4.5 sigma for the flat model. We obtain consistent values of n= -0.28 to -0.32 with uncertainties less than +-0.1 across multiple data combinations. Similar to LambdaCDM, the CHDE model predicts a lower matter density when employing DESI data instead of Planck data. This, in turn, influences the neutrino mass constraints, yielding values close to the minimal allowed range. Despite these dataset-dependent tensions, both the flat and curved CHDE models remain compatible with neutrino mass constraints from terrestrial experiments and yield posterior distributions that peaks at positive values. This behavior avoids the issue encountered in the LambdaCDM model, where the posterior peaks at negative mass values.\n\n", "2512.03302": "2025-12-02, **Lepton number violation from Higgs/$Z$ decays into a pair of right-handed neutrinos**, Arindam Das et.al., [2512.03302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03302v1)\n\n We explore signatures of Lepton Number Violation (LNV) from decays of the discovered Higgs ($h$) and Z bosons into a pair of Right-Handed Neutrinos (RHNs).

In this scenario, $h$ and the Z boson can decay into a pair of RHNs via the $h$-$\u03c6$ mixing and the $Z$-$Z'$ mixing with $Z'$ being a new massive gauge boson, respectively.

These clear signs of BSM physics motivate extensions introducing new particles and symmetries. Theoretical questions like the flavor puzzle and the strong CP problem further guide BSM frameworks. This thesis explores BSM scenarios based on two guiding principles: constructing unified frameworks that address multiple open problems in (astro)particle physics and cosmology, and emphasizing their experimental testability through detailed phenomenological analyses. This approach uncovers deep connections between seemingly disconnected sectors, offering a more complete view of fundamental physics. We investigate dark sector models for the origin of neutrino masses, proposing a novel setup: dark linear seesaw, which radiatively links neutrino mass generation to DM candidates and predicts charged lepton flavor violation. In these scenarios, dark sector particles can constitute WIMP DM, testable via direct detection experiments. We study spontaneous CP violation induced by a complex scalar singlet, acting as a common origin of low- and high-energy CP violating effects relevant for leptogenesis. We also analyze a Nelson-Barr model that solves the strong CP problem, generates a realistic CKM matrix radiatively, and yields scalar WIMP DM. Additionally, we present unified axion frameworks in which a colored sector radiatively generates neutrino masses.

Although modern mocks can reproduce galaxy clustering to some extent, the absence of baryons affects the spatial and kinematic distributions of galaxies in ways that remain insufficiently quantified. We compare the positions and velocities of satellite galaxies in the MTNG hydrodynamic simulation with those in its dark-matter-only counterpart, assessing how baryonic effects influence galaxy clustering and contrasting them with the impact of galaxy selection, i.e. the dependence of clustering on sample definition. Using merger trees from both runs, we track satellite subhaloes until they become centrals, allowing us to match systems even when their z=0 positions differ. We then compute positional and velocity offsets as functions of halo mass and distance from the halo centre, and use these to construct a subhalo catalogue from the dark-matter-only simulation that reproduces the galaxy distribution in the hydrodynamic run. Satellites in the hydrodynamic simulation lie 3-4% closer to halo centres than in the dark-matter-only case, with an offset that is nearly constant with halo mass and increases toward smaller radii. Satellite velocities are also systematically higher in the dark-matter-only run. At scales of 0.1 Mpc/h, these spatial and kinematic differences produce 10-20% variations in clustering amplitude -corresponding to 1-3$\u03c3$ assuming DESI-like errors- though the impact decreases at larger scales.

We introduce transverse-traceless perturbations and analyze how the Chern-Simons Cotton tensor induces parity-violating modifications to gravitational wave propagation, while the Pontryagin density vanishes at linear order. Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum.

As macroscopic, quantum, and topological defects, these vortices can stably orbit the black hole over extended periods, establishing their viability as novel probes for investigating black hole physics.

Additionally, we observe that relatively large vortices are accreted onto the black hole, wrapping around it while undergoing splitting and reconnecting processes. In quantum fluids with high vortex densities, turbulent flows emerge, accompanied by the formation of a vortex boundary layer near the event horizon.

Furthermore, we study the gravitational lensing by these vortices as a possible observational signature of BEC-ULDM.

For an unstable $Z'$, we show that depending on its lifetime, it can be probed by various observables up to ultraviolet physics scale around $10^9$ GeV. For $Z'$ being dark matter, we find that $m\\_{Z^\\prime} \\gtrsim 1 $ TeV is consistent with the thermal freeze-out scenario.

Despite its status as the benchmark system for dark matter and merger studies, inferred mass ratios for the Bullet Cluster have spanned a wide range from $\\sim$2:1 to $\\gtrsim$10:1 over more than two decades. We revisit this tension through three key advances: (1) JWST's exceptional data quality enables us to resolve three distinct halos, (2) DECam's wide-field coverage beyond its virial radius eliminates the need for extrapolation, and (3) high-fidelity strong-lensing priors mitigate weak-lensing model bias.

In this work, we utilize a new suite of Milky Way-mass halos from the DREAMS Project, simulated with Cold Dark Matter (CDM),to quantify the influence of baryon feedback and intrinsic halo-to-halo variance on dark matter density profiles. Our suite of 1024 halos varies over supernova and black hole feedback parameters from the IllustrisTNG model, as well as variations in two cosmological parameters. We find that Milky Way-mass dark matter density profiles in the IllustrisTNG model are largely insensitive to astrophysics and cosmology variations, with the dominant source of scatter instead arising from halo-to-halo variance. However, most of the (comparatively minor) feedback-driven variations come from the changes to supernova prescriptions. By comparing to dark matter-only simulations, we find that the strongest supernova wind energies are so effective at preventing galaxy formation that the halos are nearly entirely collisionless dark matter. Finally, regardless of physics variation, all the DREAMS halos are roughly consistent with a halo contracting adiabatically from the presence of baryons, unlike models that have bursty stellar feedback. This work represents a step toward assessing the robustness of Milky Way dark matter profiles, with direct implications for dark matter searches where systematic uncertainty in the density profile remains a major challenge.\n\n", "2512.03006": "2025-12-02, **Modeling dark matter halos with self-interacting fermions**, Fabian Hernandez-Gutierrez et.al., [2512.03006v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03006v1)\n\n In this work we study the possibility of modeling the dark matter content in galaxies as a core-halo model consisting of self-gravitating, self-interacting fermions. For the core of the halo, the dark matter fermions are degenerate, while for the halo we have considered two possibilities: the fermions have thermalized as a perfect fluidor they will follow a standard cold dark matter Navarro-Frenk-White profile. The core density profile is obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and their properties are determined by the fermion mass, the central density and the interaction strength. The mass of the fermion and the strength of the fermion self-interaction is fixed by doing a $\u03c7^2$ analysis to fit that fit the rotational curves of Low Surface Brightness galaxies. It was found that the fermion mass should be in the range $38.73~\\rm{eV}< m\\_{f} < 42.11~\\rm{eV}$ and the interparticle strength in the range $269.69 < y <348.48$ at $68$ C.L. in order to reproduce the rotational curves adequately, in the case when the halo is modeled as a thermalized ideal gas.

We have found good agreement between the data and the core-halo models, varying only one free parameter: the central density. Thus a single fermion can fit hundreds of galaxies. Nevertheless, the dark matter halo surface density relation or the halo total mass and radius depend strongly on the model for the halo.\n\n", "2512.02954": "2025-12-02, **The suppression of the matter power spectrum: strong feedback from X-ray gas mass fractions, kSZ effect profiles, and galaxy-galaxy lensing**, Jared Siegel et.al., [2512.02954v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02954v1)\n\n Baryon feedback redistributes gas relative to the underlying dark matter distribution and suppresses the matter power spectrum on small scales, but the amplitude and scale dependence of this effect are uncertain. We constrain the impact of baryon feedback on the matter power spectrum by jointly analysing X-ray gas mass fractions from the eROSITA and HSC-XXL samples and SDSS/DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles; the samples are characterised with galaxy-galaxy lensing and together span group and cluster masses at $0<z<1$.

The inferred gas profiles are more extended and the power suppression is stronger than predicted by the fiducial models of recent hydrodynamical simulation suites, including FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS.

By solving the conservation equations, we derive analytical expressions for the evolution of the dark energy and dark matter densities. The thermodynamic properties of this interacting system are then thoroughly analyzed. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that both dark components maintain positive temperatures, ensuring stability. Notably, the dark energy component transitions to a phantom regime in the past, a feature of interest for recent cosmological observations, without violating thermodynamic principles. The total entropy production is shown to be in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, an analysis of the specific heats suggests that while the dark matter sector remains thermodynamically stable, the dark energy sector undergoes a late-time phase transition, consistent with its entering into the phantom domain at effective level.\n\n", "2512.02885": "2025-12-02, **Exciton spin structure in lead halide perovskite semiconductors explored via the spin dynamics in magnetic field**, Vladimir L.

The exciton spin structure and its modification by an external magnetic field are modeled for different regimes defined by the relative magnitude of the electron-hole exchange interaction (splitting between dark and bright states) and the Zeeman spin splitting. The effects of crystal symmetry and magnetic field orientation with respect to the crystal axes are considered for lead halide perovskite crystals with band gaps in the range 1.4 - 3.5 eV, having different ratios of electron and hole g-factors. For cubic symmetry, in a longitudinal magnetic field, our theory predicts quantum beats between the bright exciton states under linearly polarized excitation and detection, while the dark exciton remains optically inactive. In a transverse magnetic field, all exciton spin states become optically active and can be excited by circularly polarized light. Reduction of the crystal symmetry leads to a zero-field offset of the exciton Larmor precession frequencies, modifying the Zeeman splitting energy dependence on magnetic field. This theoretical framework allows for the extraction of the strength of the exchange interaction and the crystal symmetry. Experimentally, we measure the exciton spin coherence via time-resolved photoluminescence at a temperature of 1.6 K in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields in orthorhombic MAPbI3 crystals. Polarization beats at the frequency of the bright exciton are observed in both configurations. Comparison with theory indicates that the excitons are in the strong exchange interaction regime, and the reduction of symmetry does not lead to a significant splitting of the exciton spin levels.\n\n", "2512.02871": "2025-12-02, **Limiting Reduction and Modified Gravity**, Antonis Antoniou et.al., [2512.02871v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02871v1)\n\n Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a framework of theories that adjust Newton's laws of gravity to explain effects such as galactic rotation anomalies, offering an alternative to dark matter. This essay examines the justification of MOND by assessing its inter-theoretical relationship to established theories across relevant scales, in particular its connection to Newtonian gravitation. We argue that MOND fails a key condition for a theory's justification--what we call 'reduction-wise justification'--since it does not adequately reduce to Newtonian gravity in a fully non-arbitrary way. More precisely, despite satisfying the standard formal criteria for successful limiting reduction, MOND does not properly reduce to Newtonian gravitation because of (i) the absence of a fundamental theoretical framework to justify the interpolating function introduced in MOND and (ii) the lack of a unified mathematical structure working across all scales, independent of Newtonian theory. Hence, the case study of MOND provides crucial results for the general debate on inter-theoretic reduction in science: MOND's failure as a case of reduction highlights important limitations in standard accounts of limiting reduction. We respond by proposing a more refined framework for limiting reduction that introduces two additional criteria to better distinguish successful from pathological reductions. More broadly, this case illustrates how analysing reduction-wise justification can serve as a powerful tool for evaluating the validity of novel theories that are not yet empirically established.\n\n", "2512.02703": "2025-12-02, **Lepton Flavor Physics in the flipped 3-3-1-1 Model: Non-Universality and Violation**, D.

We propose that CCSNe are better viewed as a multidimensional continuum of explosion outcomes, where traditional subclasses act as reference points rather than strict boundaries.

We analyze the statistical properties of pre-maximum spectropolarimetric data for 24 SNe Ia observed with VLT/FORS, focusing on the Si II $\u03bb$6355 \u00c5line. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the peak Si II polarization degree and the expansion velocity. Here, we combine these observations with multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer simulations. We consider two asphericity classes: (i) lopsided abundance distributions produced by off-center delayed-detonation transitions in near-$M\\_{Ch}$ white dwarfs or, for example, WD collisions (Class I), and (ii) global, axisymmetric density asphericities such as those arising from explosions of rapidly rotating WDs or mergers (Class II). Our model grid spans normal to subluminous SNe Ia and successfully reproduces the observed Si II velocity-polarization trend, with higher velocities associated with stronger asphericities. Consistent with observations, transitional SNe Ia and the faint end of the normal SNe Ia population show the highest Si II polarization and are best explained by Class I scenarios. In contrast, subluminous SNe Ia are dominated by Class II asphericities, characterized by lower Si II polarization but significant continuum polarization. The observed distribution of Si II polarization depends on both the observer's viewing angle $\u03b8$ and the intrinsic asphericity. Statistical analysis of these spectropolarimetric snapshots enables the separation of Class I and Class II contributions and highlights the intrinsic diversity among SNe Ia.

The explosion epoch is constrained with power-law fits to the rising TESS and ZTF light curves, with the first ZTF detection only about 27 hr after explosion. The optical light curves show a rapid 8.8 day rise and a peak luminosity typical of SNe Ic-BL (Mr=-18.5 mag). Unlike some engine-driven events, SN 2020lao shows no early optical excess or afterglow. The lack of a shock-cooling signature in the TESS/ZTF data constrains the progenitor to a compact Wolf Rayet-like star with radius of only a few solar radii. The spectra resemble those of the X-ray flash SN 2006aj but with higher velocities. Arnett modeling of the bolometric light curve, combined with Fe II velocities, yields a nickel mass of about 0.2 solar masses, an ejecta mass of about 3.2 solar masses, and a kinetic energy of about 23x10^51 erg, corresponding to a high specific kinetic energy of about 7x10^51 erg per solar mass. Spectral-synthesis modeling broadly reproduces the photospheric spectra and suggests a somewhat lower but still large specific kinetic energy (about 5 x 10^51 erg per solar mass).

Published VLA and Swift/XRT non-detections show no radio or X-ray afterglow, placing strong limits on relativistic ejecta and dense circumstellar material.

Such a large CSM is difficult to explain in a single-degenerate scenario where the donor star is a helium star.

One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z > 4) of very large quantities of \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (< 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\\pm$8 $\u03bc$Jy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission.

The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re-brightening of a single one.

The heating of the ISM by supernova shocks, and its subsequent cooling is critical to future star formation. The cooling of the diffuse shock-heated ISM is dominated by ultraviolet (UV) emission lines. These cooling regions and interfaces have complex spatial structure on sub-parsec scales. Mapping this cooling process is essential to understanding the feedback cycle of galaxies, a major goal of the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The Supernova remnants and Proxies for ReIonization Testbed Experiment (SPRITE) CubeSat Mission will house the first long-slit orbital spectrograph with sub-arcminute angular resolution covering far ultraviolet wavelengths (FUV; 1000 - 1750 angstroms) and access to the Lyman UV (lambda < 1216 angstroms). SPRITE aims to provide new insights into the stellar feedback that drives galaxy evolution by mapping key FUV emission lines at the interaction lines between supernova remnants (SNRs) and the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). SPRITE will also measure the ionizing escape from approximately 50 low-redshift (0.16 < z < 0.4) star-forming galaxies.

Despite similar $^{56} \\mathrm{Ni}$ yields between the core and shell models ($0.40$ and $0.45 \\mathrm{M\\_{\\odot}}$ respectively), the two models yield markedly different iron-group abundances.

Carr et.al., [2512.03232v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03232v1)\n\n The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in its first Data Release (DR1) already provides more than 100,000 galaxies with relative distance measurements. The primary purpose of this paper is to perform the calibration of the zero-point for the DESI Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations, which allows us to measure the Hubble constant, $H\\_0$. This sample has a lower statistical uncertainty than any previously used to measure $H\\_0$, and we investigate the systematic uncertainties in absolute calibration that could limit the accuracy of that measurement. We improve upon the DESI Early Data Release Fundamental Plane $H\\_0$ measurement by a) using a group catalog to increase the number of calibrator galaxies and b) investigating alternative calibrators in the nearby universe. Our baseline measurement calibrates to the SH0ES/Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, and finds $H\\_0=73.7\\pm 0.06\\;(\\text{stat.})\\pm 1.1\\;(\\text{syst.})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Calibrating to surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances yields a similar $H\\_0$. We explore measurements using other calibrators, but these are currently less precise since the overlap with DESI peculiar velocity tracers is much smaller. In future data releases with an even larger peculiar velocity sample, we plan to calibrate directly to Cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch, which will enable the uncertainty to decrease towards a percent-level measurement of $H\\_0$. This will provide an alternative to supernovae as the Hubble flow sample for $H\\_0$ measurements.\n\n", "2512.03228": "2025-12-02, **The DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity Survey: Mock Catalog**, J. Bautista et.al., [2512.03228v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03228v1)\n\n We describe the production of the official set of mock catalogs for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Peculiar Velocity Survey (DESI-PV) Data Release 1 (DR1). Our mock catalogs reproduce the Bright Galaxy Survey number density and clustering at low redshift $(z<0.1)$ and the DESI PV samples of Fundamental plane and Tully-Fisher distances, from which we derive peculiar velocities. We carefully match mock and data properties and we mimic measurements of distance indicators and peculiar velocities, which follow the same statistical properties as real data. Mock samples of type-Ia supernovae also complement the other two distance indicators. Our 675 available mock realizations were used consistently by our three different methodologies described in our companion papers that measure the growth rate of structure $f\u03c3\\_8$ with DESI PV DR1. Those mocks allow us to perform precise tests of clustering models and uncertainty estimation to an unprecedented level of accuracy, and compute correlations between methodologies. The consensus value for the DESI DR1 PV growth rate measurement is $f\u03c3\\_8 = 0.450 \\pm 0.055$. This sample of mock catalogs represents the largest and most realistic set for cosmological measurements with peculiar velocities to date.\n\n", "2512.03140": "2025-12-02, **A Wind-Driven Origin for the Firework Morphology of the Supernova Remnant Pa 30**, Eric R. Coughlin et.al., [2512.03140v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03140v1)\n\n Pa 30 -- the likely remnant of the Galactic type Iax supernova of 1181 AD -- displays an unusual, firework-like morphology, consisting of radial filaments extending from a common center, where a white dwarf (WD) currently drives a very fast wind (speed $\\gtrsim 10^{4}$ km s$^{-1}$). We propose the filaments arose from the Rayleigh-Taylor-unstable nature of the interface between the circumstellar medium (CSM) and the shocked wind launched by the natal WD; the filaments then elongated intact due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz-stable nature of the large initial density contrast between the wind and CSM, supplemented by the slowly declining wind density profile (relative to homologously expanding ejecta). To support this interpretation, we present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and derive the filament properties, including their speed, density, and temperature, all of which are consistent with observations. We suggest the filaments elongate until the wind and CSM densities become comparable at the contact discontinuity, which occurs within 1--10 years, and then truncate because the RTI halts. The subsequent KHI growth timescale across the current width of the filaments is longer than the age of Pa 30, so they remain intact. The filament-less central region in Pa 30 is therefore more likely a consequence of the finite timescale over which the RTI operates, rather than a wind termination shock. In general, firework-like filaments may form in other systems, provided there is a sufficiently large density contrast between the ejecta and its surroundings.\n\n", "2512.03132": "2025-12-02, **The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Dark Matter Density Profiles**, Alex M. Garcia et.al., [2512.03132v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03132v1)\n\n Astrophysical searches for dark matter in the Milky Way require a reliable model for its density distribution, which in turn depends on the influence of baryonic feedback on the Galaxy. In this work, we utilize a new suite of Milky Way-mass halos from the DREAMS Project, simulated with Cold Dark Matter (CDM),to quantify the influence of baryon feedback and intrinsic halo-to-halo variance on dark matter density profiles. Our suite of 1024 halos varies over supernova and black hole feedback parameters from the IllustrisTNG model, as well as variations in two cosmological parameters. We find that Milky Way-mass dark matter density profiles in the IllustrisTNG model are largely insensitive to astrophysics and cosmology variations, with the dominant source of scatter instead arising from halo-to-halo variance. However, most of the (comparatively minor) feedback-driven variations come from the changes to supernova prescriptions. By comparing to dark matter-only simulations, we find that the strongest supernova wind energies are so effective at preventing galaxy formation that the halos are nearly entirely collisionless dark matter. Finally, regardless of physics variation, all the DREAMS halos are roughly consistent with a halo contracting adiabatically from the presence of baryons, unlike models that have bursty stellar feedback. This work represents a step toward assessing the robustness of Milky Way dark matter profiles, with direct implications for dark matter searches where systematic uncertainty in the density profile remains a major challenge.\n\n", "2512.02680": "2025-12-02, **Peculiar SN Ic 2022esa: An explosion of a massive Wolf-Rayet star in a binary as a precursor to a BH-BH binary?**, Keiichi Maeda et.al., [2512.02680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02680v1)\n\n A class of supernovae (SNe) termed `SN Ic-CSM' are characterized by late-time emergence of narrow emission lines of elements formed in the oxygen core of a massive star. A popular scenario is the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., Circumstellar Interaction (CSI). Uncovering the progenitor system of SNe Ic-CSM plays a critical role in understanding the final evolution of a massive star to a bare C+O star. In this Letter, we present observations of SN 2022esa which we show is an SN Ic-CSM. Surprisingly, a stable periodicity of ~32 days is found in its light-curve evolution with a hint of a slowly increasing period over ~200 days. We argue that the main power source is likely the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich CSM, while the energy input by the post-SN eccentric binary interaction within the SN ejecta is another possibility. In either case, we propose a massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) star as the progenitor, in a WR-WR or WR-BH (black hole) binary that will eventually evolve to a BH-BH binary. Specifically, in the CSI scenario, the progenitor system is an eccentric binary system with an orbital period of about a year, leading to the observed periodicity through the modulation in the CSM density structure. We also show that some other objects, superluminous SN I 2018ibb (a pair-instability SN candidate) and peculiar SN Ic 2022jli (the first example showing stable periodic modulation), show observational similarities to SNe Ic-CSM and may be categorized as SN Ic-CSM variants. Complemented with a large diversity in their light-curve evolution, we propose that SNe Ic-CSM (potentially linked to SNe Ibn/Icn) are a mixture of multiple channels that cover a range of properties in the progenitor star, the binary companion, and the binary orbit.\n\n", "2512.02391": "2025-12-02, **\"SNe Ia twins\" in the Hubble flow, and the determination of H0**, Pilar Ruiz-Lapuente et.al., [2512.02391v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02391v2)\n\n We have applied our approach of using ''SNe Ia twins''in the Hubble flow to obtain distances to SNe Ia at z $>$ 0.015 and derive H$\\_{0}$.   Our results, taking a single step between the low z domain and the Hubble flow, validate the three rung classical method.   We find, however, that the full compilation of distances, both in Pantheon+ and in the Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP),   contain some inaccurate values in the colors due to an underestimate of reddening by dust. This produces odd individual values for H$\\_{0}$   from single SNe Ia.   On the average, those erroneous estimates do not affect the mean value of H$\\_{0}$, which is characterized by the bulk of well--modeled SNe Ia.   Our sample of carefully addressed SNe Ia in the Hubble flow contains a dozen supernovae, for which the distances are determined with high accuracy.   Three of these SNe Ia are of the Broad Line subtype and can be compared with SN 1989B in M66, a host galaxy with a unique convergence of the   Cepheid distance determination and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars (TRGB) determination by the CCHP group. They point to a weighted average of   H$\\_{0}$ $=$ 73.556 $\\pm$ 2.084 (stat) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc $^{-1}$.   There is as well a very good agreement on the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 5643 between those derived with Cepheids by SH0ES and those derived with   the use of J-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (JAGB stars) by the CCHP, which makes them very good anchors.   The sample of 12 SNe Ia gives a value of H$\\_{0}$ $=$ 72.833 $\\pm$ 1.306(stat) $\\pm$ 1.151 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in Cepheids,   and of H$\\_{0}$ $=$ 72.388 $\\pm$ 1.272 (stat) $\\pm$ 1.015 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in JAGBs by the CCHP.
