The ejecta are predominantly driven by neutrino heating, principally due to neutrino capture on free neutrons and protons. Such neutrino interaction plays a crucial role for setting neutron richness in the ejecta. Recent hydrodynamics work with sophisticated neutrino transport indicates that the ejecta are only mildly neutron rich or even proton rich. In such conditions a wide variety of trans-iron isotopes are synthesized, while the neutron richness is insufficient for the production of r-process nuclei. In this capter, basic concepts of nucleosynthesis in neutrino-heated ejecta and neutrino-driven winds of core-collapse supernovae are presented along with latest studies. Neutrino-heated ejecta indicate the early ejecta component within the first few seocnds in which anisotropic convective activities of material above the neutrinosphere become important for nucleosynthesis. Then, neutrino-driven winds follow, which are approximately isotropic outflows emerging from the surface of a proto-neutron star . According to such characteristics, studies of nucleosynthesis here are based on recent multi-dimentional hydrodynamics simulations and semi-alalytic wind solutions, respectively. These studies suggest that trans-iron species up to the atomic mass number of 90, as well as some rare isotopes such as 48Ca and 92Mo, are produced in the neutrino-heated ejecta. Neutrino-driven winds are unlikely sources of r-process nuclei, but rather promising sources of proton-rich isotopes up to the atomic number of 110.\n\n", "2303.09369": "2023-03-16, **Earth tomography with supernova neutrinos at future neutrino detectors**, Rasmi Hajjar et.al., [2303.09369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09369v1)\n\n Earth neutrino tomography is a realistic possibility with current and future neutrino detectors, complementary to geophysics methods. The two main approaches are based on either partial absorption of the neutrino flux as it propagates through the Earth (at energies about a few TeV) or on coherent Earth matter effects affecting the neutrino oscillations pattern (at energies below a few tens of GeV). In this work, we consider the latter approach focusing on supernova neutrinos with tens of MeV. Whereas at GeV energies, Earth matter effects are driven by the atmospheric mass-squared difference, at energies below $\\sim 100$~MeV, it is the solar mass-squared difference what controls them. Unlike solar neutrinos, which suffer from significant weakening of the contribution to the oscillatory effect from remote structures due to the neutrino energy reconstruction capabilities of detectors, supernova neutrinos can have higher energies and thus, can better probe the Earth's interior. We shall revisit this possibility, using the most recent neutrino oscillation parameters and up-to-date supernova neutrino spectra. The capabilities of future neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande and JUNO are presented, including the impact of the energy resolution and other factors. Assuming a supernova burst at 10~kpc, we show that the average Earth's core density could be determined within $\\lesssim 10\\%$ at $1\\sigma$ confidence level, being Hyper-Kamiokande, with its largest mass, the most promising detector to achieve this goal.\n\n", "2303.09360": "2023-03-16, **Nuclear neutron radius and weak mixing angle measurements from latest COHERENT CsI and atomic parity violation Cs data**, M.

In both flavor-universal and nonuniversal coupling scenarios, we find that the ACT data prefers strong neutrino self-interaction that delays neutrino free streaming until just before the matter-radiation equality.

For the combined dataset, the flavor-specific interaction still provides a better fit to the CMB data than $\\Lambda$CDM. This trend persists even when neutrino mass is taken into account and extra radiation is added.

However, the data from these experiments present numerous challenges to CNNs, such as non-regular geometry, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Consequently, CNNs are highly inefficient on neutrino telescope data, and require significant pre-processing that results in information loss. We propose sparse submanifold convolutions (SSCNNs) as a solution to these issues and show that the SSCNN event reconstruction performance is comparable to or better than traditional and machine learning algorithms. Additionally, our SSCNN runs approximately 16 times faster than a traditional CNN on a GPU. As a result of this speedup, it is expected to be capable of handling the trigger-level event rate of IceCube-scale neutrino telescopes.

Due to the interplay between the SMBH and dark matter (DM), the DM density profile in the innermost region of the Galaxy, which is crucial for the DM indirect detection, is still an open question. Among the most popular models in the literature, the theoretical spike profile proposed by Gondolo and Silk (1999; GS hereafter) is well adopted. In this work, we investigate the DM spike profile using updated data from the Keck and VLT telescopes considering that the presence of such an extended mass component may affect the orbits of the S-stars in the Galactic center. We examine the radius and slope of the generalized NFW spike profile, analyze the Einasto spike, and discuss the influence of DM annihilation on the results. Our findings indicate that an initial slope of $\\gamma \\gtrsim 0.92$ for the generalized NFW spike profile is ruled out at a 95% confidence level. Additionally, the spike radius $R\\_{\\rm sp}$ larger than 21.5 pc is rejected at 95% probability for the Einasto spike with $\\alpha=0.17$, which also contradicts the GS spike model.

In the present work, we calculate the quasi-normal modes who dominate the ringdown process of the perturbed black holes surrounded by dark matter spike. We find that the isospectrality for black holes with dark matter spike will break down.

The map will investigate the distanceredshift relationship and the evolution of cosmic structures thanks to two instruments: the NISP and the VIS. The NISP (Near Infrared Spectro-Photometer) is operating in the near-IR spectral range (0.9-2$\\mu$m) with two observing modes: the photometric mode for the acquisition of images with broad band filters, and the spectroscopic mode for the acquisition of slitless dispersed images on the detectors. The spectroscopic mode uses four low resolution grisms to cover two spectral ranges: three ''red'' grisms for 1250-1850nm range, with three different orientations, and one ''blue'' grism for 920- 1300nm range. The NISP grisms are complex optical components combining four main optical functions: a grism function (dispersion without beam deviation of the first diffracted order) done by the grating on the prism hypotenuse, a spectral filter done by a multilayer filter deposited on the first face of the prism to select the spectral bandpass, a focus function done by the curved filter face of the prism (curvature radius of 10m) and a spectral wavefront correction done by the grating which grooves paths are nor parallel, neither straight. The development of these components have been started since 10 years at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM) and was linked to the project phases: prototypes have been developed to demonstrate the feasibility, then engineering and qualification models to validate the optical and mechanical performance of the component, finally the flight models have been manufactured and tested and will be installed on NISP instrument.

These need to be studied via $N$-body simulations, which are imperative to analyze high density collapsed regions into dark matter halos.

We map the initial conditions of the matter density field into classification labels of dark matter halo structures. The Halo Mass Function of the simulations is calculated and reconstructed with theoretical methods as well as our trained algorithms. We test several Machine Learning techniques where we could find that the Random Forest and Neural Networks proved to be the better performing tools to classify dark matter particles in cosmological simulations.

Numerical simulations solving the Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equation, which governs FDM dynamics, show that FDM halos consist of a central solitonic core (representing the ground state of the SP equation), surrounded by a large envelope of excited states. Wave interference gives rise to order unity density fluctuations throughout the envelope and causes the soliton to undergo density oscillations and execute a confined random walk in the central region of the halo. The resulting gravitational potential perturbations are an efficient source of dynamical heating. Using high-resolution numerical simulations of a $6.6 \\times 10^{9} \\rm M\\_{\\odot}$ FDM halo with boson mass, $m\\_{\\rm b}=8 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\rm eV$, we investigate the impact of this dynamical heating on the structure and kinematics of spheroidal dwarf galaxies of a fixed mass but different initial sizes and ellipticities.

We find that they continuously increase their sizes and central velocity dispersions. In addition, their kinematic structures become strongly radially anisotropic, especially in the outskirts. Dynamical heating also causes initially ellipsoidal galaxies to become more spherical over time from the inside out and gives rise to distorted, non-concentric isodensity contours.

However, vorticity has been observed in the universe, especially on the scales of clusters, filaments, galaxies, etc. Recent results from high-resolution general relativistic N-body simulation show that the vorticity power spectrum dominates over the power spectrum of the divergence of the peculiar velocity field on scales where the effective field theory of large-scale structure breaks down. Incidentally, this scale also corresponds to the scale where shell-crossing occurs. Several studies have suggested a link between shell crossing in the dark matter fluid and the vorticity generation in the universe, however, no clear proof of how it works exists yet. We describe for the first time how vorticity is generated in a universe such as ours with expanding and collapsing regions. We show how vorticity is generated at the boundary of the expanding and collapsing regions. Our result indicates that the amplitude of the generated vorticity is determined by the difference in gradients of the gravitational potential, pressure and the expansion rate of a one-parameter family of geodesics across the boundary. Additionally, we argue that the presence of vorticity in the matter fields implies a non-vanishing magnetic part of the Weyl tensor.

We start with the premise that the complex structure of the cosmic web can be described by the sum of its individual components: dark matter, gas, and galaxies, all distributed within spherical haloes with a range of masses. The halo properties are specified through a series of simulation-calibrated ingredients including the halo mass function, non-linear halo bias and a dark matter density profile that can additionally account for the impact of baryon feedback. By incorporating a model of the galaxy halo occupation distribution, the properties of central and satellite galaxies, their non-linear bias and intrinsic alignment can be predicted. Through analytical calculations of spherical collapse in exotic cosmologies, the halo model also provides predictions for non-linear clustering in beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM models. The halo model has been widely used to model observations of a variety of large-scale structure probes, most notably as the primary technique to model the underlying non-linear matter power spectrum. By documenting these varied and often distinct use cases, we seek to further coherent halo model analyses of future multi-tracer observables.

But SFDM reproduces MOND only up to a certain distance from the galactic center and only for kinematic observables. Most importantly, it does not affect trajectories of light. We test whether or not this is in conflict with a recent analysis of weak gravitational lensing which has probed accelerations around galaxies at unprecedentedly large radii. This analysis found the data to be close to the prediction of MOND, suggesting they might be difficult to fit with SFDM. To investigate this matter, we solved the equations of motion of the model and compared the result to observational data.

In searches for new and exotic physics, the expected small astrophysical backgrounds at low energies make these antinuclei ideal probes for, e.g., dark matter. At the same time, their composite structure and small binding energies imply that they can be used in collider experiments to probe the hadronisation process and two-particle correlations. For the proper interpretation of such experimental studies, an improved theoretical understanding of (anti-) nuclei production in specific kinematic regions and detector setups is needed. In this work, we develop a coalescence framework for (anti-) deuteron production which accounts for both the emission volume and momentum correlations on an event-by-event basis. This framework goes beyond the equal-time approximation, which has been commonly assumed in femtoscopy experiments and (anti-) nucleus production models until now. Using PYTHIA~8 as an event generator, we find that the equal-time approximation leads to an error of O(10%) in low-energy processes like $\\Upsilon$ decays, while the errors are negligible at LHC energies.

Recently a novel detection technique using the cosmic microwave background (CMB) was proposed, which relies on the fact that the axion field oscillates at a frequency equal to its mass in appropriate units, leading to a time-dependent birefringence. For appropriate oscillation periods this allows the axion field at the telescope to be detected via the induced sinusoidal oscillation of the CMB linear polarization.

Vector dark matter with an $s$-channel vector mediator**, Christopher Chang et.al., [2303.08351v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08351v1)\n\n Global fits explore different parameter regions of a given model and apply constraints obtained at many energy scales. This makes it challenging to perform global fits of simplified models, which may not be valid at high energies. In this study, we derive a unitarity bound for a simplified vector dark matter model with an $s$-channel vector mediator, and apply it to global fits of this model with \\GB in order to correctly interpret missing energy searches at the LHC. Two parameter space regions emerge as consistent with all experimental constraints, corresponding to different annihilation modes of the dark matter. We show that although these models are subject to strong validity constraints, they are currently most strongly constrained by measurements less sensitive to the high-energy behaviour of the theory. Understanding when these models cannot be consistently studied will become increasingly relevant as they are applied to LHC Run 3 data.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2303.09548": "2023-03-16, **Photometric study of the late-time near-infrared plateau in Type Ia supernovae**, M. Deckers et.al., [2303.09548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09548v1)\n\n We present an in-depth study of the late-time near-infrared plateau in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which occurs between 70-500 d. We double the existing sample of SNe Ia observed during the late-time near-infrared plateau with new observations taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, Gemini, New Technology Telescope, the 3.5m Calar Alto Telescope, and the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our sample consists of 24 nearby SNe Ia at redshift < 0.025. We are able to confirm that no plateau exists in the Ks band for most normal SNe Ia. SNe Ia with broader optical light curves at peak tend to have a higher average brightness on the plateau in J and H, most likely due to a shallower decline in the preceding 100 d. SNe Ia that are more luminous at peak also show a steeper decline during the plateau phase in H. We compare our data to state-of-the-art radiative transfer models of nebular SNe Ia in the near-infrared. We find good agreement with the sub-Mch model that has reduced non-thermal ionisation rates, but no physical justification for reducing these rates has yet been proposed. An analysis of the spectral evolution during the plateau demonstrates that the ratio of [Fe II] to [Fe III] contribution in a near-infrared filter determines the light curve evolution in said filter. We find that overluminous SNe decline slower during the plateau than expected from the trend seen for normal SNe Ia\n\n", "2303.09259": "2023-03-16, **The Origin of the Large Magellanic Cloud Globular Cluster NGC 2005**, Andr\u00e9s E. Piatti et.al., [2303.09259v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09259v1)\n\n The ancient Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) globular cluster NGC 2005 has recently been reported to have an ex-situ origin, thus, setting precedents that the LMC could have partially formed from smaller merged dwarf galaxies. We here provide additional arguments from which we conclude that is also fairly plausible an in-situ origin of NGC 2005, based on the abundance spread of a variety of chemical elements measured in dwarf galaxies, their minimum mass in order to form globular clusters, the globular cluster formation imprints kept in their kinematics, and the recent modeling showing that explosions of supernovae are responsible for the observed chemical abundance spread in dwarf galaxies. The present analysis points to the need for further development of numerical simulations and observational indices that can help us to differentiate between two mechanisms of galaxy formation for the LMC, namely, a primordial dwarf or an initial merging event of smaller dwarfs.\n\n", "2303.08997": "2023-03-16, **Overall Binary Evolution Theory**, Diogo Belloni et.al., [2303.08997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08997v1)\n\n Accreting compact objects are crucial to understand several important astrophysical phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae, gravitational waves, or X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray bursts. In addition, they are natural laboratories to infer fundamental properties of stars, to investigate high-energy phenomena and accretion processes, to test theories of stellar and binary evolution, to explore interactions between high-density plasma and very strong magnetic fields, to examine the interplay between binary evolution and dynamical interactions (in the case they belong to dense star clusters), and they can even be used as a probe for the assembling process of galaxies over cosmic time-scales. Despite the fundamental importance of accreting compact objects for astrophysics and recent progress with the comprehension of these fascinating objects, we still do not fully understand how they form and evolve. In this chapter, we will review the current theoretical status of our knowledge on these objects, and will discuss standing problems and potential solutions to them.\n\n", "2303.08849": "2023-03-15, **Electron-Ion Temperature Ratio in Astrophysical Shocks**, John C.

On one hand, the model is simple due to its 1D geometry, on the other hand, the feedback includes the ionising radiation, stellar winds and the radiation pressure acting on gas and dust. The star cluster is formed from the gas flowing into the cloud centre and the feedback parameters are determined from stellar evolution models and the cluster star forming history. The model is compared to the semi-analytic code WARPFIELD implementing similar physical processes and exploring the scenario that the young cluster R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud was formed due to re-collapse of the shell formed by the previous generation star cluster. A good qualitative agreement is found, however, $3 - 4$ times higher stellar mass is needed to disrupt the cloud in our model, because it takes into account (contrary to WARPFIELD) self-gravity of the cloud surrounding the shell. We use the model to explore star formation in clouds with different mass, radius and density profile measuring their star formation efficiency (SFE), i.e. the fraction of the cloud mass converted to stars. We found that SFE is a function of a single parameter, $\\mathrm{log(SFE)} \\propto -n\\_{hm}^{-0.46}$, with $n\\_{hm}$ being the cloud mean particle density within its half-mass radius.

Yet past estimates have varied by more than an order of magnitude ($\\approx10-300$ yr$^{-1}$) owing to limitations in both discovery methods as well as assumptions regarding the Galactic dust distribution and extragalactic stellar populations. Recent estimates utilizing synoptic near-infrared surveys have begun to provide a glimpse of a consensus ($\\approx25-50$ yr$^{-1}$); however, a consistent estimate remains lacking. Here, we present the first all-sky search for Galactic novae using 8 years of data from the NEOWISE mid-infrared (MIR) survey. Operating at $3.4$ and $4.6$ $\\mu$m where interstellar extinction is negligible, the 6-month cadence NEOWISE dataset offers unique sensitivity to discover slowly evolving novae across the entire Galaxy. Using a novel image subtraction pipeline together with systematic selection criteria, we identify a sample of 49 rapidly evolving MIR outbursts as candidate Galactic novae. While 27 of these sources are known novae, the remaining are previously missed nova candidates discovered in this work. The unknown events are spatially clustered along the densest and most heavily obscured regions of the Galaxy where previous novae are severely underrepresented. We use simulations of the NEOWISE survey strategy, the pipeline detection efficiency, and our criteria to derive a Galactic nova rate of $47.9^{+3.1}\\_{-8.3}$ yr$^{-1}$.
