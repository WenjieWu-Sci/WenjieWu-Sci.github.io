Although a rare process, it could be significantly boosted by such new physics, and it also allows the electroweak theory to be tested in a new regime. We demonstrate that the forward neutrino physics program at the Large Hadron Collider offers a promising opportunity to measure for the first time, dimuon neutrino tridents with a statistical significance exceeding $5\\sigma$. We present predictions for various proposed experiments and outline a specific experimental strategy to identify the signal and mitigate backgrounds, based on \"reverse tracking\" dimuon pairs in the FASER$\\nu$2 detector.

This map will enable us to probe multiple aspects of cosmology, from dark energy to neutrino mass. We are focusing here on one type of object observed by DESI, the Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The aim is to use their spectra to determine whether they are indeed LBGs, and if so, to determine their distance from the Earth using a phenomenon called redshift. This will enable us to place these galaxies on the DESI 3D map.   The aim is therefore to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) inspired by QuasarNET (See arXiv:1808.09955), performing simultaneously a classification (LBG type or not) and a regression task (determine the redshift of the LBGs). Initially, data augmentation techniques such as shifting the spectra in wavelengths, adding noise to the spectra, or adding synthetic spectra were used to increase the model training dataset from 3,019 data to over 66,000. In a second phase, modifications to the QuasarNET architecture, notably through transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian optimization, boosted model performance.   Gains of up to 26% were achieved on the Purity/Efficiency curve, which is used to evaluate model performance, particularly in areas with interesting redshifts, at low (around 2) and high (around 4) redshifts. The best model obtained an average score of 94%, compared with 75% for the initial model.\n\n", "2406.16546": "2024-06-24, **A Scotogenic model with U(1) symmetry and a scalar dark matter**, Anjan Kumar Barik et.al., [2406.16546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16546v1)\n\n We study a scotogenic model augmented with an additional U(1) gauge and a discrete Z2 symmetry.

We explore the parameter space of the model for which the DM relic density is satisfied, and the correct low-energy neutrino observables are reproduced.

The physics behind their masses remains unknown and requires introducing new particles and interactions. An elegant solution to this problem is provided by the seesaw mechanism. Typically considered at a high scale, it is potentially testable in gravitational wave experiments by searching for a spectrum from cosmic strings, which offers a rather generic signature across many high-scale seesaw models. Here we consider the possibility of a low-scale seesaw mechanism at the PeV scale, generating neutrino masses within the framework of a model with gauged U(1) lepton number. In this case, the gravitational wave signal at high frequencies arises from a first order phase transition in the early Universe, whereas at low frequencies it is generated by domain wall annihilation, leading to a double-peaked structure in the gravitational wave spectrum. The signals discussed here can be searched for in upcoming experiments, including gravitational wave interferometers, pulsar timing arrays, and astrometry observations.\n\n", "2406.16460": "2024-06-24, **Constraining dark matter from strong phase transitions in a $U(1)_{L_\u03bc-L_\u03c4}$ model: Implications for neutrino masses and muon $g-2$**, Sandhya Choubey et.al., [2406.16460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16460v1)\n\n In this paper, we study a non-minimal gauged $U(1)\\_{L\\_{\\mu}-L\\_{\\tau}}$ model, where we add two complex singlet scalars, three right-handed Majorana neutrinos (RHN), and a vector-like dark fermion to the Standard Model (SM), all non-trivially charged under the extra gauge symmetry. The model offers an easy resolution to the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly, which fixes the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the two-zero minor structure in the RHN mass matrix provides successful predictions for neutrino oscillation parameters, including the Dirac phase. The extended scalar sector can easily induce first-order phase transitions. We identify all possible phase transition patterns in the three-dimensional field space. We quantify the associated gravitational waves from the sound wave source and demonstrate that the signatures can be observed in future space-based experiments. We find that strong first-order phase transitions require large values of scalar quartic couplings which constrain the scalar dark matter (DM) relic density to a maximum of $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-5}$ when we consider the DM direct detection bound. Nonetheless, the model successfully explains the DM relic density via contribution from the vector-like dark fermion.

TAO will measure the energy spectrum of reactor antineutrinos with unprecedented precision, which will benefit both reactor neutrino physics and the nuclear database. A detector geometry and event visualization system has been developed for TAO. The software is based on ROOT packages and embedded in the TAO offline software framework. It provides an intuitive tool to visualize the detector geometry, tune the reconstruction algorithm, understand the neutrino physics, and monitor the operation of reactors at NPP.

Instead of adopting texture zeros in the lepton Yukawa matrices, which cause both theoretical and experimental troubles, here we propose two-$\\boldsymbol\\epsilon$ textures, where $\\boldsymbol\\epsilon$ is a small number. Combined with neutrino oscillation experimental data, we find that a large CP angle is preferred for the normal neutrino mass order. In contrast, the CP angle almost vanishes for the inverted order.

Its observation and the spectral shape of the associated recoil spectrum is sensitive to a variety of exotic new physics scenarios and many experimental efforts are underway. Within the context of the reactor antineutrino anomaly, which initially indicated eV-scale sterile neutrino's, the modeling of the reactor antineutrino spectrum has seen a significant evolution in the last decade. Even so, uncertainties remain due to a variety of nuclear structure effects, incomplete information in nuclear databases and fission dynamics complexities. Here, we investigate the effects of these uncertainties on one's ability to accurately distinguish new physics signals.

Currently, people have explored a lot of axion detection experiments, including passively detecting the existing axions in the universe, and actively generating axions in the laboratory. Recently, axion-coupled laser-plasma interactions have been discussed as a novel method to detect axions. Petawatt (PW) lasers are considered as a powerful tool to study not only the vacuum polarization but also the axion coupling, due to their extreme fields. However, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation is still missed in current studies, which limits the understanding of axion-coupled laser-plasma interactions. In this paper, we proposed the method to include the axion field and the coupling with electromagnetic (EM) fields in PIC codes. The axion wave equation and modified Maxwell's equations are numerically solved, while the EM field modulation from axions is considered as a first-order perturbation. Meanwhile, different axion field boundary conditions are considered to satisfy different simulation scenarios. The processes of conversions between axions and photons, and weak laser pulse propagation with axion effects are checked as benchmarks of the code.

Owing to the absence of an excess of $\\gamma$-ray signatures originating from Ursa Major III, observations of $\\gamma$-rays, such as those from Fermi-LAT, can be utilized to set constraints on the DM annihilation cross section. In this study, we determine the DM density profile, and consider the relationship between DM density and velocity dispersion at different locations within Ursa Major III through Jeans analysis. We calculate the J-factor of Ursa Major III for s-wave annihilation, along with the effective J-factors for p-wave and Sommerfeld enhanced annihilation scenarios. Utilizing these derived J-factors, we set stringent constraints on DM annihilation cross sections in three scenarios. Given the substantial impact of member star identification on the J-factor of Ursa Major III, we further calculate J-factors with the condition of excluding the largest velocity outlier. Our analysis reveals a notable reduction in the median value and an increase in the deviation of J-factors, thereby leading to considerably weaker constraints.\n\n", "2406.16545": "2024-06-24, **Canonical quantization of the dark Dirac field and time asymmetry**, Andrei Galiautdinov et.al., [2406.16545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16545v1)\n\n We perform canonical quantization of the single-component, spin-zero field that was introduced by Dirac in 1971 and recently suggested as a candidate for dark matter by Bogomolny. The massive and massless cases are treated separately. Since in the massive case only positive-frequency modes are normalizable and regarded as physical, the mode expansion for the field involves annihilation operators only, making the quantization procedure particularly simple. The corresponding Hamiltonian of the system turns out to be unambiguous, with no need for normal ordering. The positive-energy requirement imposed on the second-quantized system leads to bosonic commutation relations, in agreement with the spin-statistics theorem. The boson nature of the positive-energy Dirac particles, which, evidently, have no antiparticles, hints at the possibility of a dark, background Bose-Einstein condensate that drives different parts of the universe in the same temporal direction. In the massless case, on the other hand, we explore the possibility of allowing the mode expansion to involve both positive- and negative-frequency components, which leads to the anticommutation relations, resulting in the fermionic behavior of the field in ultrarelativistic limit.\n\n", "2406.16103": "2024-06-23, **Populating Galaxies Into Halos Via Machine Learning on the Simba Simulation**, Pratyush Kumar Das et.al., [2406.16103v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16103v1)\n\n We present machine learning (ML)-based pipelines designed to populate galaxies into dark matter halos from N-body simulations. These pipelines predict galaxy stellar mass ($M\\_*$), star formation rate (SFR), atomic and molecular gas contents, and metallicities, and can be easily extended to other galaxy properties and simulations. Our approach begins by categorizing galaxies into central and satellite classifications, followed by their ML classification into quenched (Q) and star-forming (SF) galaxies. We then develop regressors specifically for the SF galaxies within both central and satellite subgroups. We train the model on the $(100\\mathrm{h^{-1}Mpc})^3$ Simba galaxy formation simulation at $z=0$. Our pipeline yields robust predictions for stellar mass and metallicity and offers significant improvements for SFR and gas properties compared to previous works, achieving an unbiased scatter of less than 0.2 dex around true Simba values for the halo-$M\\_{\\rm HI}$ relation of central galaxies. We also show the effectiveness of the ML-based pipelines at $z=1,2$.

The impact of stellar feedback, mergers, and black holes on the cold ISM in simulated galaxies**, Jakub Nadolny et.al., [2406.16533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16533v1)\n\n Removing cold interstellar medium (ISM) from a galaxy is central to quenching star formation. However, the exact mechanism of this process remains unclear. The objective of this work is to find the mechanism responsible for dust and gas removal in simulated early-type galaxies (ETGs). A statistically significant sample of massive (M\\_*>$10^{10}$M$\\_\\odot$), simulated ETG in a redshift range of 0.02--0.32 is studied in the context of its ISM properties. In particular, we investigate the cold dust and gas removal timescales, the cold gas inflows, and their relation with black hole (BH) mass. We also investigate the evolution of galaxies in the dust vs. star formation rate (SFR) plane and the influence of merger events. We find agreement with previous observational works considering the timescales of dust and HI removal from ETGs. When considering the dust-to-stellar mass ratio as a function of time in simulations, we recovered a similar decline as in the observational sample as a function of stellar age, validating its use for timing the ISM decline. Moreover, we recover the observed relation between dust mass and SFR for actively star-forming galaxies as well as for passive ETGs.

Finally, we find that type II supernova reverse shocks dominate the dust destruction at the early stages of ETG evolution, while at later times stellar feedback becomes more important. We show that merger events lead to morphological transformations by increasing the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio followed by an increase in BH masses.
