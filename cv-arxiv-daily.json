Motivated by previous works on a possible Dark Matter (DM) explanation for the TeV cut-off observed in the innermost $\\sim 16$ pc of the Galaxy, we aim to constrain the DM density profile up to a radius $\\sim 450$ pc from the GC. In this region, cosmological simulations and Galactic dynamics studies fail to produce a strong prediction of the DM profile. With our proof-of-concept analysis, we set upper limits on the density distribution of thermal multi-TeV WIMPs, compatible with the observed gamma-ray flux. The results agree with the hypothesis of a DM density enhancement in the GC with respect to the benchmark NFW profile ($\\gamma=1$) and allow us to exclude profiles with a slope $\\gamma \\gtrsim 1.3$. We also investigate the possibility that such an enhancement could be related to the existence of a DM spike associated with the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. We find out that the existence of an adiabatic DM spike smoothed by the scattering off of WIMPs by the bulge stars may be consistent with the observed gamma-ray flux if the spike forms on an underlying generalized NFW profile with $\\gamma \\lesssim 0.8$, corresponding to a spike slope $\\gamma\\_{sp-star}= 1.5$ and radius $R\\_\\text{sp-stars} \\sim 25$-$30$ pc. Instead, in the extreme case of the instantaneous growth of the black hole, the profile could have up to $\\gamma \\sim 1.2$, a corresponding $\\gamma\\_{sp-inst}=1.4$ and $R\\_\\text{sp-inst}\\sim 15$-$25$ pc. Moreover, the results of our analysis of the total DM mass enclosed within the S2 orbit are less stringent than the spectral analysis. Our work aims to guide future studies of the GC region, with both current and next-generation telescopes, like the next Cherenkov Telescope Array, that will be able to scan the GC with improved flux sensitivity and angular resolution.\n\n", "2307.06804": "2023-07-13, **CLASH-VLT: The inner slope of the MACS J1206.2-0847 mass density profile**, A. Biviano et.al., [2307.06804v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06804v1)\n\n The inner slope gammaDM of the dark matter (DM) density profile of cosmological halos carries information about the properties of DM and/or baryonic processes affecting the halo gravitational potential. Cold DM cosmological simulations predict steep inner slopes, gammaDM>~1. We test this prediction on the MACS J1206.2-0847 cluster at redshift z=0.44, whose DM density profile was claimed to be cored at the center. We determine the cluster DM density profile from 2 kpc from the cluster center to the virial radius (~2 Mpc), using the velocity distribution of ~500 cluster galaxies and the velocity dispersion profile of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG), obtained from VIMOS@VLT and MUSE@VLT data. We solve the Jeans equation of dynamical equilibrium using an upgraded version of the MAMPOSSt method. The total mass profile is modeled as a sum of a generalized-NFW profile that describes the DM component, allowing for a free inner slope of the density profile, a Jaffe profile that describes the BCG stellar mass component, and a non-parametric baryonic profile that describes the sum of the remaining galaxy stellar mass and of the hot intra-cluster gas mass. Our total mass profile is in remarkable agreement with independent determinations based on X-ray observations and strong lensing. We find gammaDM=0.7 -0.1 +0.2 (68% confidence levels), consistent with predictions from recent LambdaCDM cosmological numerical simulations.\n\n", "2307.06798": "2023-07-13, **Current status and desired accuracy of the isotopic production cross-sections relevant to astrophysics of cosmic rays II. Fluorine to Silicon (and updated LiBeB)**, Yoann G\u00e9nolini et.al., [2307.06798v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06798v1)\n\n High-precision cosmic-ray data from ongoing and recent past experiments (Voyager, ACE-CRIS, PAMELA, ATIC, CREAM, NUCLEON, AMS-02, CALET, DAMPE) are being released in the tens of MeV/n to multi-TeV/n energy range. Astrophysical and dark matter interpretations of these data are limited by the precision of nuclear production cross-sections. In Paper I, PRC 98, 034611 (2018), we set up a procedure to rank nuclear reactions whose desired measurements will enable us to fully exploit currently available data on CR Li to N ($Z=3-7$) species. Here we extend these rankings to O up to Si nuclei ($Z=8-14$), also updating our results on the LiBeB species. We also highlight how comprehensive new high precision nuclear data, that could e.g. be obtained at the SPS at CERN, would be a game-changer for the determination of key astrophysical quantities (diffusion coefficient, halo size of the Galaxy) and indirect searches for dark matter signatures.\n\n", "2307.06765": "2023-07-13, **Sensing directional forces in levitated optomechanics**, J. M. H. Gosling et.al., [2307.06765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06765v1)\n\n Optomechanical devices are being harnessed as sensors of ultraweak forces for applications ranging from inertial sensing to the search for the elusive dark matter; For the latter, the focus is on detection of either higher energy single recoils or ultralight, narrowband sources; a directional signal is expected. However, the possibility of searching for a directional broadband signal need not be excluded; with this and other applications in mind, we apply a stochastic signal with a well defined direction, $\\Psi$, to a trapped and cooled levitated nanosphere. We find that cross-correlation power spectra offer a calibration-free distinctive signature of the presence of a directional force, and its orientation quadrant, unlike normal power spectral densities (PSDs). With calibration we are able to accurately measure the angle $\\Psi$, akin to a force compass in a plane.\n\n", "2307.06757": "2023-07-13, **PBHs and GWs from $\\mathbb{T}^2$-inflation and NANOGrav 15-year data**, Seyed Ali Hosseini Mansoori et.al., [2307.06757v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06757v1)\n\n In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism in $\\mathbb{T}^2$-inflation to enhance the power spectrum large enough to seed primordial black holes (PBHs) formation. To accomplish this, we consider the coupling function between the inflaton field and $\\mathbb{T}^2= T\\_{\\mu \\nu}T^{\\mu \\nu}$ term. PBHs formed within this scenario can contribute partially or entirely to dark matter (DM) abundance. Furthermore, the amplification in the scalar power spectrum will concurrently produce significant scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) as a second-order effect. In addition, the energy spectrum associated with SIGWs can be compatible with the recent NANOGrav 15-year stochastic gravitational wave detection and fall into the sensitivity range of other forthcoming GW observatories.\n\n", "2307.06690": "2023-07-13, **Anti-de Sitterian \"massive\" elementary systems and their Minkowskian and Newtonian limits**, Mohammad Enayati et.al., [2307.06690v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06690v1)\n\n We elaborate the definition and properties of ''massive\" elementary systems in the (1+3)-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS$\\_4$) spacetime, on both classical and quantum levels. We fully exploit the symmetry group Sp$(4,\\mathbb R)$, that is, the two-fold covering of SO$\\_0(2,3)$ (Sp$(4,\\mathbb R) \\sim$ SO$\\_0(2,3)\\times \\mathbb Z\\_2$), recognized as the relativity/kinematical group of motions in AdS$\\_4$ spacetime. In particular, we discuss that the group coset Sp$(4,\\mathbb R)$/S(U(1)x SU(2)), as one of the Cartan classical domains, can be interpreted as a phase space for the set of free motions of a test massive particle on AdS$\\_4$ spacetime; technically, in order to facilitate the computations, the whole process is carried out in terms of complex quaternions. The (projective) unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the Sp$(4,\\mathbb R)$ group, describing the quantum version of such motions, are found in the discrete series of the Sp$(4,\\mathbb R)$ UIRs. We also describe the null-curvature (Poincar\\'{e}) and non-relativistic (Newton-Hooke) contraction limits of such systems, on both classical and quantum levels. On this basis, we unveil the dual nature of ''massive\" elementary systems living in AdS$\\_4$ spacetime, as each being a combination of a Minkowskian-like massive elementary system with an isotropic harmonic oscillator arising from the AdS$\\_4$ curvature and viewed as a Newton-Hooke elementary system. This matter-vibration duality will take its whole importance in the quantum regime (in the context of the validity of the equipartition theorem) in view of its possible r\\^{o}le in the explanation of the current existence of dark matter.\n\n", "2307.06660": "2023-07-13, **Design of a mobile neutron spectrometer for the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS)**, Melih Solmaz et.al., [2307.06660v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06660v1)\n\n Environmental neutrons are a source of background for rare event searches (e.g., dark matter direct detection and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments) taking place in deep underground laboratories. The overwhelming majority of these neutrons are produced in the cavern walls by means of intrinsic radioactivity of the rock and concrete. Their flux and spectrum depend on time and location. Precise knowledge of this background is necessary to devise sufficient shielding and veto mechanisms, improving the sensitivity of the neutron-susceptible underground experiments. In this report, we present the design and the expected performance of a mobile neutron detector for the LNGS underground laboratory. The detector is based on capture-gated spectroscopy technique and comprises essentially a stack of plastic scintillator bars wrapped by gadolinium foils. The extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the detector will be capable of measuring ambient neutrons at low flux levels ($\\sim$$10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{n/cm^2/s}$) at LNGS, where the ambient gamma flux is by about 5 orders of magnitude larger.\n\n", "2307.06586": "2023-07-13, **Dark baryon from pure Yang-Mills theory and its GW signature from cosmic strings**, Masaki Yamada et.al., [2307.06586v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06586v1)\n\n We point out that SO($2N$) pure Yang-Mills theory provides a candidate for dark matter (DM) without the explicit need to impose any additional symmetry. The DM candidate is a particular type of glueball, which we refer to as a baryonic glueball, that is naturally stable for a moderately large $N$. In this case, the intercommutation probability of cosmic strings (or macroscopic color flux tubes) is quite low, which offers characteristic gravitational wave signals to test our model. In particular, our model can simultaneously account for both abundance of DM and the recently reported gravitational wave signals detected in pulsar timing array experiments, including NANOGrav.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2307.06911": "2023-07-13, **Forecasting constraints on the baryon mass fraction in the IGM from fast radio bursts and type Ia supernovae**, Thais Lemos et.al., [2307.06911v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06911v1)\n\n Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are transient events with a high energy and short duration in the radio frequency. By identifying the origin of the pulse, it is possible to measure the redshift of the host galaxy, which can be used to constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters and test aspects of fundamental physics when combined with the observed dispersion measure ($DM$). However, some factors limit the application of FRBs in cosmology: (i) the current poor modelling of the fluctuations in the $DM$ due to spatial variation in the cosmic electrons density; (ii) the fact that the fraction of baryon mass in the intergalactic medium ($f\\_{IGM}$) is degenerated with some cosmological parameters; (iii) the limited current knowledge about host galaxy contribution ($DM\\_{host}$). In this work, we investigate the impact of different redshift distribution models of FRBs to constrain the baryon fraction in the IGM and host galaxy contribution. We use a cosmological model-independent method developed in previous work \\cite{Lemos2023} to perform the analysis and combine simulated FRB data from Monte Carlo simulation and supernovae data. Since the physical mechanism responsible for the burst is still unknown, we assume four distribution models for the FRBs, namely gamma-ray bursts (GRB), star formation rate (SFR), uniform and equidistant (ED). Also, we consider samples with $N = 15$, 30, 100 and 500 points and three different values of the fluctuations of electron density in the $DM$, $\\delta = 0, 10, 100$ pc/cm$^{3}$.

C. Jones et.al., [2307.06692v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06692v1)\n\n Supernova (SN) 1987A is the nearest supernova in $\\sim$400 years. Using the {\\em JWST} MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph, we spatially resolved the ejecta, equatorial ring (ER) and outer rings in the mid-infrared 12,927 days after the explosion. The spectra are rich in line and dust continuum emission, both in the ejecta and the ring. Broad emission lines (280-380~km~s$^{-1}$ FWHM) seen from all singly-ionized species originate from the expanding ER, with properties consistent with dense post-shock cooling gas. Narrower emission lines (100-170~km~s$^{-1}$ FWHM) are seen from species originating from a more extended lower-density component whose high ionization may have been produced by shocks progressing through the ER, or by the UV radiation pulse associated with the original supernova event. The asymmetric east-west dust emission in the ER has continued to fade, with constant temperature, signifying a reduction in dust mass. Small grains in the ER are preferentially destroyed, with larger grains from the progenitor surviving the transition from SN into SNR. The ER is fit with a single set of optical constants, eliminating the need for a secondary featureless hot dust component. We find several broad ejecta emission lines from [Ne~{\\sc ii}], [Ar~{\\sc ii}], [Fe~{\\sc ii}], and [Ni~{\\sc ii}]. With the exception of [Fe~{\\sc ii}]~25.99$\\mu$m, these all originate from the ejecta close to the ring and are likely being excited by X-rays from the interaction. The [Fe~{\\sc ii}]~5.34$\\mu$m to 25.99$\\mu$m line ratio indicates a temperature of only a few hundred K in the inner core, consistent with being powered by ${}^{44}$Ti decay.\n\n"}}
