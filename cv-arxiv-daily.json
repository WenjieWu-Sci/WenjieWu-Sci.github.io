One goal of the Upgrade is to improve the positioning calibration of the optical sensors to increase the angular resolution for neutrino directional reconstruction. An acoustic calibration system will be deployed to explore the capability of achieving this using trilateration of propagation times of acoustic signals. Ten Acoustic Modules (AM) capable of sending and receiving acoustic signals with frequencies from 5 to 30 kHz will be installed within the detector volume. Additionally, compact acoustic sensors inside 15 optical sensor modules will complement the acoustic calibration system. With this system, we aim for an accuracy of a few tens of cm to localize the Acoustic Modules and sensors. Due to the longer attenuation length of sound compared to light within the ice, acoustic position calibration is especially interesting for the upcoming IceCube-Gen2 detector, which will have a string spacing of around 240 m. In this contribution we present an overview of the technical design of the Acoustic Module as well as results of performance tests with a first complete prototype.\n\n", "2308.08464": "2023-08-16, **Comments on \"On the Dirac-Majorana neutrinos distinction in four-body decays\" (arXiv:2305.14140 [hep-ph])**, C.

Neutrinos, which are linked to the ignition of reactions triggered during the flash and serve as the only cooling process in the inert core, can help characterize changes in internal structure. In this work, we create 18 stellar models across three mass and six metallicity values, chosen in the context of the stellar abundance problem, to compare the evolutionary path up to and probe the helium flash by conducting a detailed study of neutrino emission throughout this crucial phase of stellar evolution. We demonstrate how thermal neutrino emissions could have an imprint on global asteroseismic parameters and use them as an additional tool to infer the impact of compositional changes. We find that a precision of 0.3 $\\mu$Hz in the determination of $\\Delta \\nu$ is enough to distinguish between between the two most prominent solar composition models and confirm that asteroseismic observation can be enough to classify a star as undergoing the process of helium subflashes.

The superposition of an extragalactic flux and a galactic flux results in directional structure and variations in the spectrum. In this work, we use 12.3 years of high-purity muon-neutrino induced muon track data to perform a dedicated search for this galactic emission, combined with a spectral measurement of the isotropic astrophysical neutrino flux. To distinguish a galactic component from the dominant atmospheric and isotropic astrophysical components, the precise directional information available for muon tracks is fully utilized in a three-dimensional forward folding likelihood fit.

Understanding detector systematic effects is a continuous process. This requires the Monte Carlo simulation to be updated periodically to quantify potential changes and improvements in science results with more detailed modeling of the systematic effects. IceCube's largest systematic effect comes from the optical properties of the ice the detector is embedded in. Over the last few years there have been considerable improvements in the understanding of the ice, which require a significant processing campaign to update the simulation. IceCube normally stores the results in a central storage system at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but it ran out of disk space in 2022. The Prototype National Research Platform (PNRP) project thus offered to provide both GPU compute and storage capacity to IceCube in support of this activity.

Our focus is the mass range $1 \\; {\\rm eV} \\lesssim m\\_X \\lesssim 100 \\; {\\rm MeV}$; masses lighter than about an ${\\rm eV}$ have strong constraints from fifth-force law constraints, while masses heavier than about $100$~MeV are constrained by other probes.

We find $U(1)\\_{B-L}$ is more strongly constrained by $\\Delta N\\_{\\rm eff}$ than previously considered. The bounds arise from the energy density in electrons and neutrinos slowly siphoned off into $X$ bosons, which become nonrelativistic, redshift as matter, and then decay, dumping their slightly larger energy density back into the SM bath causing $\\Delta N\\_{\\rm eff} > 0$.

In the latter scenario, we comment on the additional implications of thermalized right-handed neutrinos decaying during BBN.

We do not assume any mass hierarchy in the gauge sector and use the mass of the additional $\\text{Z}'$ boson and a corresponding gauge-boson mixing angle to parameterize the extension of the gauge sector. The fermion sector is parameterized by the mass of the additional fermion and a fermion mixing angle.

Yet, predictions of the UHE neutrino flux and interaction cross section -- whose measurement is co-dependent -- are laden with significant uncertainty that, if unaddressed, could misrepresent the capabilities to measure one or the other. To address this, we advocate for the joint measurement of the UHE neutrino spectrum and neutrino-nucleon cross section, including of their energy dependence, without assuming prior knowledge of either. We illustrate our methods by adopting empirical parametrizations of the neutrino spectrum, in forecasts geared to the planned radio array of the IceCube-Gen2 neutrino telescope. We warn against using simple parametrizations -- a simple power law or one augmented with an exponential cut-off -- that might fail to capture features of the spectrum that are commonplace in the predictions. We argue instead for the use of flexible parametrizations -- a piecewise power law or an interpolating polynomial -- that ensure accuracy.

The source was in a high-flux state in the optical, ultraviolet, X-ray, and GeV gamma-ray bands around the time of the neutrino event, exhibiting daily variability in the soft X-ray flux. The X-ray data from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR characterize the transition between the low-energy and high-energy components of the broadband spectral energy distribution, and the gamma-ray data from Fermi-LAT, VERITAS, and H.E.S.S. require a spectral cut-off near 100 GeV. Both measurements provide strong constraints on leptonic and hadronic models. We analytically explore a synchrotron self-Compton model, an external Compton model, and a lepto-hadronic model. Models that are entirely based on internal photon fields face serious difficulties in matching the observed spectral energy distribution (SED). The existence of an external photon field in the source would instead explain the observed gamma-ray spectral cut-off in both leptonic and lepto-hadronic models, and it would allow a proton jet power that marginally agrees with the Eddington limit in the lepto-hadronic model. A numerical lepto-hadronic model with external target photons reproduces the observed SED and is reasonably consistent with the neutrino event despite requiring a high jet power.\n\n", "2308.07566": "2023-08-15, **Sensitivity to CP Discovery in the Presence of Lorentz Invariance Violating Potential at T2HK/T2HKK**, Supriya Pan et.al., [2308.07566v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07566v1)\n\n Investigation of conservation/violation of CP symmetry in the leptonic sector is very essential in understanding the evolution of the universe.

In the case of non-phenomenological DM profiles with no analytic expressions, the art of finding RC best-fits including the full baryonic $+$ DM free parameters can be difficult and time-consuming.

I postulate that as a result of symmetries of the pre-quantum theory, in the absence of coupling the two sectors both have Higgs potentials that lie precisely at the boundary between phases with nonzero and zero Higgs vaccum expectation. Turning on the coupling between the two sectors can break the degeneracy, pushing the Higgs potential in one sector into the domain of nonzero Higgs expectation (giving the visible sector), and pushing the Higgs potential in the other sector into the domain of zero Higgs expectation (giving the dark sector).

M\u00fcller et.al., [2308.08312v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08312v1)\n\n Fallback in core-collapse supernova explosions is potentially of significant importance for the birth spins of neutron stars and black holes. It has recently been pointed out that the angular momentum imparted onto a compact remnant by fallback material is subtly intertwined with its kick because fallback onto a moving neutron star or black hole will preferentially come for a conical region around its direction of travel. We show that contrary to earlier expectations such one-sided fallback accretion onto a neutron star will tend to produce spin-kick misalignment. Since the baroclinic driving term in the vorticity equation is perpendicular to the nearly radial pressure gradient, convective eddies in the progenitor as well as Rayleigh-Taylor plumes growing during the explosion primarily carry angular momentum perpendicular to the radial direction. Fallback material from the accretion volume of a moving neutron star therefore carries substantial angular momentum perpendicular to the kick velocity. We estimate the seed angular momentum fluctuations from convective motions in core-collapse supernova progenitors and argue that accreted fallback material will almost invariably be accreted with the maximum permissible specific angular momentum for reaching the Alfv\\'en radius. This imposes a limit of $\\mathord{\\sim}10^{-2}M\\_\\odot$ of fallback accretion for fast-spinning young neutron stars with periods of $\\mathord{\\sim}20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and less for longer birth spin periods.\n\n", "2308.08298": "2023-08-16, **White Dwarf Mass Growth in Cataclysmic Variables: Roles of Dwarf Novae**, Wei-Min Liu et.al., [2308.08298v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08298v1)\n\n The disc instability mechanism (DIM) is widely accepted to account for the transient behaviour of dwarf novae (DNe), which experience short outbursts separated by long quiescence. The duty cycle (the ratio between the outburst duration and the recurrence time) determines the amount of accreted mass by the white dwarf (WDs) during outbursts, thus playing an important role in the long-term binary evolution. Employing the code of Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we systemically investigate the influence of the duty cycles on the evolution of DNe and the mass growth of accreting carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs. Our calculations show that, while the DIM can considerably influence the accretion process, efficient WD-mass growth requires a particular range of the duty cycle. For WDs with the initial masses of 0.6, 0.7 and 1.1 $M\\_\\odot$, these duty cycles are 0.006$\\,\\leq$$d$$\\,\\leq$0.007, $d$\\,=\\,0.005 and $d$\\,=\\,0.003, and the accumulated mass of the WDs can reach 0.1, 0.13 and 0.21 $M\\_\\odot$, respectively. In all of our simulations, no CO WDs can grow their masses to the explosion mass of Type Ia supernovae of about $1.38~M\\_\\odot$. Because of a much short timescale of the outburst state, the final donor-star masses and orbital periods are insensitive to the duty cycles. Therefore, we propose that the DIM in DNe could alleviate the WD mass problem to some extent.\n\n", "2308.07559": "2023-08-15, **Giant molecular cloud G18.1-0.3+51 associated with HII regions and supernova remnant in the 3-kpc expanding ring**, Yoshiaki Sofue et.al., [2308.07559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07559v1)\n\n Analyzing the high-resolution CO-line survey of the Galactic plane with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope (FUGIN), we show that the star-forming complex G18.15-0.30+51 (G18) at radial velocity of 51 \\kms is {a tight triple association of a giant molecular cloud (GMC), HII regions, and a supernova remnant (SNR).} The kinematical distance of G18 is determined to be $d=3.9\\pm 0.2$ kpc for near solution for circular rotation, $12\\pm 0.2$ kpc for far solution, or $d=6.1\\pm 0.1$, if it is in the 3-kpc expanding ring. The HI-line absorption of radio continuum from the HII regions constrains the distance to $5.6 \\lesssim d\\_{\\rm SNR}\\le 7.6$ kpc. The $\\Sigma-D$ (radio brightness-diameter) relation yields the distance to the SNR of $d\\_{\\rm SNR}=10.1^{+11.5}\\_{-4.7}$ kpc, allowing for a minimum distance of 5.4 kpc.
