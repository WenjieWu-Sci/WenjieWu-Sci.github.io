Ding et.al., [2303.05437v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05437v1)\n\n There is a global trend to increase the light yield of CsI scintillators used in neutrino and dark matter detection by operating undoped crystals at cryogenic temperatures. However, high light yield alone is not sufficient to guarantee a low energy threshold. The response of undoped crystals to nuclear recoils at cryogenic temperatures is equally important. A liquid nitrogen-based cryostat was developed to measure the nuclear quenching factor of a small undoped CsI crystal using monoenergetic neutron beams at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL). To avoid neutron scattering in high-$z$ materials, they were intentionally reduced around the crystal. The structure and performance of the cryostat are described in detail. Using this cryostat, a light yield of $33.4 \\pm 1.7$ photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent (PE/keV$\\_\\text{ee}$) was observed at 5.9 keVee, enabling the measurement of nuclear quenching factors at very low energies. The results of the quenching factor measurement will be reported in a subsequent paper.   Non-negligible overshooting was observed in the tails of light pulses.

These structures have a shape reminiscent of a sea urchin: They consist of rods of width $w$ and length $L \\gg w$ periodically arranged on the surface of sphere of radius $R\\sim L$. Such a structure functions as a diffraction phase grating and produces a region around its center where the fractional neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry is $\\sim k\\delta\\_\\nu L$, where $k$ is the neutrino momentum, and $\\delta\\_\\nu$ the deviation of the neutrino index of refraction from unity.

This results in a force $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ times bigger than the one we recently pointed out due to the neutrinos' reflection on the surface of the Earth.

Finally, we show that this $C \\nu B$ diffractor can be used as a Dark Matter diffractor.

The flux depends on meteorological quantities such as the air temperature, which affects the density of air. Competition between decay and re-interaction of those mesons in the first particle production generations gives rise to a higher neutrino flux when the air density in the stratosphere is lower, corresponding to a higher temperature.

This resonant production mechanism has been used in various contexts, including dark photon dark matter and primordial magnetic field production. However, for this resonant production to work in an expanding universe, a large axion-dark photon coupling is required, which is not easy to realize in terms of model building and requires the introduction of many charged fermions and/or the complex clockwork mechanism. In this paper, we present a new scenario that efficiently produces dark photons from the axion with a much smaller coupling. This is possible by modifying the dynamics of axion and significantly delaying the onset of oscillations, as in the so-called trapped misalignment mechanism. As a specific example, we consider models in which dark photon production occurs efficiently despite the small axion-dark photon coupling by temporally trapping an axion in a wrong minimum and releasing it after the Hubble parameter becomes much smaller than the axion mass. In this scenario, it is expected that the polarization asymmetry of dark photons and gravitational waves generated from dark photons will be significantly reduced.\n\n", "2303.05248": "2023-03-09, **Primordial black hole isocurvature modes from non-Gaussianity**, Rapha\u00ebl van Laak et.al., [2303.05248v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05248v1)\n\n Primordial black holes (PBHs) are black holes that might have formed in high density regions in the early universe. The presence of local-type non-Gaussianity can lead to large-scale fluctuations in the PBH formation rate. If PBHs make up a non-negligible fraction of dark matter, these fluctuations can appear as isocurvature modes, and be used to constrain the amplitude of non-Gaussianity. We build upon the results of previous work by extending the calculation to include peaks theory and making use of the compaction $C$ for the formation criteria, accounting for non-linearities between $C$ and the curvature perturbation $\\zeta$. For quadratic models of non-Gaussianity, our updated calculation gives constraints that are largely unaltered compared to those previously found, while for cubic models the constraints worsen significantly.

We have assumed that the halos are triaxial in shape but their axes in the disk plane (a and b) are equal, so that q=c/a measures the halo flattening. We have used the HI velocity dispersion, derived from the stacked HI emission lines and the disk surface density to determine the disk potential and the halo shape at the R25 and 1.5R25 radii. We have applied our model to 20 nearby galaxies, of which 6 are large disk galaxies with M(stellar)>10^10 solar mass, 8 have moderate stellar masses and 6 are low surface brightness dwarf galaxies. Our most important result is that gas rich galaxies that have M(gas)/M(baryons)>0.5 have oblate halos (q < 0.55), whereas stellar dominated galaxies have a range of q values, ranging from 0.21+-0.07 in NGC4190 to 1.27+-0.61 in NGC5194.

We show that the high densities and low metallicities at this epoch guarantee a high star-formation efficiency in the most massive dark-matter haloes. Feedback-free starbursts (FFBs) occur when the free-fall time is shorter than $\\sim 1$ Myr, below the time for low-metallicity massive stars to develop winds and supernovae. This corresponds to a characteristic density of $\\sim 3\\times 10^3$cm$^{-3}$.

Using the StarTrack binary evolution code, we compare one- and four-dimensional binary evolution models to the compact binary mergers reported in recent gravitational-wave observing runs, considering merger detection rates and mass distributions. We demonstrate that the predicted detection rates and mass distribution of simulated binaries are effective in constraining binary evolution formation. We first consider a one-dimensional model, studying the effect of SuperNova (SN) kick velocity ($\\sigma\\_{eff}$) and follow this up with a four-dimensional study of $\\sigma\\_{eff}$, mass transfer efficiency ($f\\_a$) and angular momentum ejection ($\\beta$) during Roche-lobe accretion, and an observation-driven reduction in the mass-loss rate from stellar wind ($f\\_{wind1}$). Of those four formation parameters, we find that three of them ($\\sigma\\_{eff}$, $f\\_a$, and $f\\_{wind1}$) can be efficiently constrained at this time. After initially sampling from a uniform prior in the space of these parameters, we refined our sampling by iteratively fitting a truncated Gaussian, and sampling from those Gaussians to propose new simulations with each iteration. Our maximum likelihood simulation (K0559) has parameters: $\\sigma\\_{eff} = 108.3$ km/s, $f\\_a = 0.922$ (indicating efficient mass transfer), and $f\\_{wind1} = 0.328$.\n\n", "2303.05258": "2023-03-09, **Common envelope jets supernova with thermonuclear outburst progenitor for the enigmatic supernova remnant W49B**, Aldana Grichener et.al., [2303.05258v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05258v1)\n\n We suggest a common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) origin to the supernova remnant (SNR) W49B where jets launched by a neutron star (NS) that collapsed to a black hole (BH) together with a thermonuclear outburst of the disrupted red super giant's (RGS's) core powered and shaped the ejecta. The jets account for the highly non-spherical morphology of W49B and the thermonuclear outburst to its high iron abundance. CEJSNe are violent events powered by jets that a NS or a BH launch as they orbit inside a red supergiant star and accrete mass from its envelope and then from its core. We classify the CEJSN process to either a case where the NS/BH enters the core to form a common envelope evolution (CEE) inside the core or to a case where the NS/BH tidally disrupts the core. In the later case the core material forms an accretion disk around the NS that might experience a thermonuclear outburst, leading to an energetic event powered by both jets and thermonuclear burning. We term this scenario thermonuclear CEJSN. We find that the maximum core mass that leads to this scenario with a NS is $2 M\\_{\\rm \\odot} \\lesssim M\\_{\\rm core} \\lesssim 3.5M\\_{\\rm \\odot}$. We estimate the event rates of CEJSN that go through tidal disruption of the core by a NS to be 5 per 1000 core collapse supernovae.\n\n", "2303.05083": "2023-03-09, **Evolution of the post merger remnants from the coalescence of oxygen-neon and carbon-oxygen white dwarf pairs**, Chengyuan Wu et.al., [2303.05083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05083v1)\n\n Although multidimensional simulations have investigated the processes of double WD mergers, post-merger evolution only focused on the carbon-oxygen (CO) WD or helium (He) WD merger remnants. In this work, we investigate for the first time the evolution of the remnants stemmed from the merger of oxygen-neon (ONe) WDs with CO WDs. Our simulation results indicate that the merger remnants can evolve to hydrogen- and helium-deficient giants with maximum radius of about 300Rsun. Our models show evidence that merger remnants more massive than 1.95Msun can ignite Ne before significant mass-loss ensues, and they thus would become electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe). However, remnants with initial masses less than 1.90Msun will experience further core contraction and longer evolutionary time before reaching at the conditions for Ne-burning. Therefore their fates are more dependent on mass-loss rates due to stellar winds, and thus more uncertain. Relatively high mass-loss rates would cause such remnants to end their lives as ONe WDs. Our evolutionary models can naturally explain the observational properties of the double WD merger remnant IRAS 00500+6713 (J005311). As previously suggested in the literature, we propose and justify that J005311 may be the remnant from the coalescence of an ONe WD and an CO WD. We deduce that the final outcome of J005311 would be a massive ONe WD rather than a supernova explosion. Our investigations may be able to provide possible constraints on the wind mass-loss properties of the giants which have CO-dominant envelopes.\n\n", "2303.05051": "2023-03-09, **The Early Light Curve of a Type Ia Supernova 2021hpr in NGC 3147: Progenitor Constraints with the Companion Interaction Model**, Gu Lim et.al., [2303.05051v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05051v1)\n\n The progenitor system of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is expected to be a close binary system of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf (WD) and a non-degenerate star or another WD. Here, we present results from a high-cadence monitoring observation of SN 2021hpr in a spiral galaxy, NGC 3147, and constraints on the progenitor system based on its early multi-color light curve data. First, we classify SN 2021hpr as a normal SN Ia from its long-term photometric and spectroscopic data. More interestingly, we found a significant \"early excess\" in the light curve over a simple power-law $\\sim t^{2}$ evolution. The early light curve evolves from blue to red and blue during the first week. To explain this, we fitted the early part of $BVRI$-band light curves with a two-component model of the ejecta-companion interaction and a simple power-law model. The early excess and its color can be explained by shock cooling emission due to a companion star having a radius of $8.84\\pm0.58$$R\\_{\\odot}$. We also examined HST pre-explosion images with no detection of a progenitor candidate, consistent with the above result. However, we could not detect signs of a significant amount of the stripped mass from a non-degenerate companion star ($\\lesssim0.003\\,M\\_{\\odot}$ for H$\\alpha$ emission). The early excess light in the multi-band light curve supports a non-degenerate companion in the progenitor system of SN 2021hpr. At the same time, the non-detection of emission lines opens a door for other methods to explain this event.\n\n", "2303.04966": "2023-03-09, **Infrared Ejecta and Cold Dust in the Young Supernova Remnant N132D**, Jeonghee Rho et.al., [2303.04966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04966v1)\n\n We present Spitzer, WISE, and Herschel observations of the young supernova remnant (SNR) N132D in the LMC, including 3-40 microns Spitzer IRS mapping, 12 microns WISE and 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 microns Herschel images. The high-velocity lines of [Ne II] at 12.8 microns, [Ne III] at 15.5 microns, and [O IV] 26 microns reveal infrared ejecta concentrated in a central ring and coincide the optical and X-ray ejecta. Herschel images reveal far-IR emission coinciding with the central ejecta, which suggests that the IR emission is freshly formed, cold dust in the SN-ejecta. The infrared spectra are remarkably similar to those of another young SNR of 1E0102 with Ne and O lines. Shock modeling of the Ne ejecta emission suggests a gas temperature of 300 - 600 K and densities in the range 1000-20,000 cm^{-3} in the post-shock photoionized region. The IR continuum from the ejecta shows an 18 microns-peak dust feature. We performed spectral fitting to the IRS dust continuum and Herschel photometry. The dust mass associated with the central ejecta is 1.25+-0.65 Msun, while the 18 microns dust feature requires forsterite grains. The dust mass of the central ejecta region in N132D is higher than those of other young SNRs, which is likely associated with its higher progenitor mass. We discuss the dust productivity in the ejecta of N132D and infer its plausible implications for the dust in the early Universe.\n\n", "2303.04827": "2023-03-08, **Efficient Formation of Massive Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn by Feedback-Free Starbursts**, Avishai Dekel et.al., [2303.04827v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04827v1)\n\n JWST observations reveal a surprising excess of luminous galaxies at $z\\sim 10$, consistent with efficient conversion of the accreted gas into stars, unlike the suppression of star formation by feedback at later times. We show that the high densities and low metallicities at this epoch guarantee a high star-formation efficiency in the most massive dark-matter haloes. Feedback-free starbursts (FFBs) occur when the free-fall time is shorter than $\\sim 1$ Myr, below the time for low-metallicity massive stars to develop winds and supernovae. This corresponds to a characteristic density of $\\sim 3\\times 10^3$cm$^{-3}$. A comparable threshold density permits a starburst by allowing cooling to star-forming temperatures in a free-fall time. The galaxies within $\\sim 10^{11} M\\_\\odot$ haloes at $z \\sim 10$ are expected to have FFB densities. The halo masses allow efficient gas supply by cold streams in a halo crossing time $\\sim 80$ Myr. The FFBs gradually turn all the accreted gas into stars in clusters of $\\sim 10^{4-7.5} M\\_\\odot$ within galaxies that are rotating discs or shells. The starbursting clouds are shielded against feedback from earlier stars. We predict high star-formation efficiency above thresholds in redshift and halo mass, where the density is $10^{3-4}$cm$^{-3}$. The $z\\sim 10$ haloes of $\\sim 10^{10.8} M\\_\\odot$ are predicted to host galaxies of $\\sim 10^{10} M\\_\\odot$ with SFR $\\sim 65 M\\_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and sub-kpc sizes. The metallicity is $\\leq 0.1 Z\\_\\odot$ with little gas, dust, outflows and hot circumgalactic gas, allowing a top-heavy IMF but not requiring it.

A. Borges et.al., [2303.04793v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04793v1)\n\n In this work we consider a class of interacting vacuum corresponding to a generalised Chaplygin gas (gCg) cosmology. In particular we analyse two different scenarios at perturbation level for the same background interaction characterised by the parameter $\\alpha$: (i) matter that follows geodesics, corresponding to homogeneous vacuum, and (ii) a covariant ansatz for vacuum density perturbations. In the latter case, we show that the vacuum perturbations are very tiny as compared to matter perturbations on sub-horizon scales. In spite of that, depending on the value of the Chaplygin gas parameter $\\alpha$, vacuum perturbations suppress or enhance the matter growth rate as compared to the case (i). We use Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), type Ia supernovae (SNe) and Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) measurements to test the observational viability of the model. We found that the mean value of our joint analysis clearly favours a positive interaction, i.e., an energy flux from dark matter to dark energy, with $\\alpha \\approx 0.143$ in both cases, while the cosmological standard model, recovered for $\\alpha$=0, is ruled out by 3$\\sigma$ confidence level.

Farmer et.al., [2303.04520v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04520v1)\n\n The cosmic origin of the elements, the fundamental chemical building blocks of the Universe, is still uncertain. Binary interactions play a key role in the evolution of many massive stars, yet their impact on chemical yields is poorly understood. Using the MESA stellar evolution code we predict the chemical yields ejected in wind mass loss and the supernovae of single and binary-stripped stars. We do this with a large 162 isotope nuclear network at solar-metallicity. We find that binary-stripped stars are more effective producers of the elements than single stars, due to their increased mass loss and an increased chance to eject their envelopes during a supernova. This increased production by binaries varies across the periodic table, with Fluorine and Potassium being more significantly produced by binary-stripped stars than single stars. We find that the C12/C13 could be used as an indicator of the conservativeness of mass transfer, as C13 is preferentially ejected during mass transfer while C12 is preferentially ejected during wind mass loss. We identify a number of gamma-ray emitting radioactive isotopes that may be used to help constrain progenitor and explosion models of core-collapse supernovae with next-generation gamma-ray detectors. For single stars we find V44 and Mn52 are strong probes of the explosion model, while for binary-stripped stars it is Cr48. Our findings highlight that binary-stripped stars are not equivalent to two single stars and that detailed stellar modelling is needed to predict their final nucleosynthetic yields.\n\n"}}
