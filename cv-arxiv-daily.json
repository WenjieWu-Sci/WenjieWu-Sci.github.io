We model the cross-correlation of the ISWRS effect with gravitational potential tracers like galaxy clustering, cosmic shear, and CMB-lensing potential, to forecast results from these experiments. Our analysis also accounts for the presence of massive neutrinos to assess the feasibility of identifying the $\u03bd$$\u039b$CDM model and constraining the neutrino mass sum, M$\u03bd$. Our findings indicate that the CMB-lensing potential reconstructed by CMB-HD is expected to provide the most promising results, achieving $\\gtrsim$ 5$\u03c3$ detections even under conservative assumptions for detector noise and foregrounds, thereby allowing differentiation between $\u03bd$$\u039b$CDM models. Galaxy clustering can also yield significant detections, whereas cosmic shear can provide valuable results only if non-linearities are accurately modelled, beyond the capabilities of currently available analytical approaches. These latter LSS probes do not provide strong constraining power on M$\u03bd$. While our findings suggest that future CMB experiments and LSS surveys will enable the detection of the ISWRS effect, they do not imply significant prospects for imposing new constraints on neutrino masses in the near future.\n\n", "2602.15652": "2026-02-17, **The COHERENT Experiment: 2026 Update**, M.

Several successful CEvNS measurements have been achieved in recent years with tens-of-kg detector masses, with a CsI scintillating crystal, a liquid argon single-phase detector, and high-purity germanium spectrometers. For the next phase, COHERENT aims at high-statistics detection of CEvNS events for precision tests of the standard model of particle physics, and to probe new physics beyond-the-standard model. Percent-level precision can be achieved by lowering thresholds, reducing backgrounds, and by scaling up the detector masses. It goes hand in hand with benchmarking the neutrino flux from the SNS. Further detectors will measure CEvNS in additional nuclei, including lighter target nuclei such as sodium and neon, to continue to test the expected neutron-number-squared dependence of the cross section. COHERENT can furthermore study charged-current and neutral-current inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections on various nuclei at neutrino energies below $\\sim$50 MeV. Many of these cross sections have never been measured before, but are critical input for the interpretation of core-collapse supernova detection in large-scale neutrino experiments such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and HALO.\n\n", "2602.15644": "2026-02-17, **Bayesian parameter study of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469**, Bj\u00f6rn Eichmann et.al., [2602.15644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15644v1)\n\n Multimessenger observation of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469 indicate a characteristic feature in the radio band (the so-called mm-bump) as well as indication of high-energy neutrinos by the AGN corona. Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $\u03b3$-rays and neutrinos.   We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $\u03b3\u03b3$-pair attenuation of the escaping $\u03b3$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting.   Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results. This manifests itself even more clearly in the case of NGC 7469, where the mm-bump needs to emerge from a coronal size $R\\_{\\rm c}>100\\,\\mathcal{R}\\_{\\rm s}$, whereas (TeV-PeV)-neutrino emission requires $R\\_{\\rm c}< 10\\,\\mathcal{R}\\_{\\rm s}$. Similar to what has previously been shown in other wavebands, our analysis highlights that the spatial extension of the so-called AGN corona depends the considered energy of the messenger.

In next-generation facilities, such as the Jinping neutrino experiment, the horizon for a detection with a local significance of $3 \u03c3$ would be extended to almost $3$ pc.

However, at low dark matter masses, dark matter particles can also \"evaporate\" due to subsequent collisions with the hot thermal plasma of the Sun. While several modeling studies have calculated the competitive dynamics of dark matter evaporation and annihilation, observational studies have typically assumed a fixed 4 GeV \"evaporation limit\", below which dark matter evaporates before it can annihilate. In this paper, we carefully consider the competitive effects of dark matter evaporation and annihilation on the resulting spin-dependent dark matter nucleon cross-section limits, finding that Solar observations can continue to exceed terrestrial constraints by between 1-5 orders of magnitude for dark matter masses between 2-4 GeV for dark matter annihilation to both neutrinos and long-lived mediators.\n\n", "2602.15104": "2026-02-16, **ABCMB: A Python+JAX Package for the Cosmic Microwave Background Power Spectrum**, Zilu Zhou et.al., [2602.15104v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15104v1)\n\n We present ABCMB, a differentiable Einstein-Boltzmann solver for the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

We show that \\textit{non-invertible selection rules} (NISRs) naturally enforce the absence of tree-level terms while ensuring a dominant one-loop contribution. Intriguingly, the same non-invertible structure also stabilizes the dark matter candidate, providing a unified radiative origin of neutrino mass and dark sector stability.

We analyze archival near-infrared polarimetric data of the protoplanetary disk (PPD) around HD 163296.

The resulting six-epoch time series is consistent with a constant polarization angle within the measurement uncertainties, while being sensitive to timescales of $\\sim 170-400$ days. The typical polarization angle uncertainties are $1.6$--$6.4$ degrees, partly driven by multiple scattering in the optically thick disk, which broadens the intrinsic polarization angle distribution and introduces additional dispersion in the representative polarization angle.

This analysis leads to additional insight into the properties of these rotating solitons, including a method for computing their characteristic angular velocity.

The hallmark of SUEPs is the emission of very large multiplicities of soft dark mesons ($\u03c0\\_D$), which can overcome the usual phase-space suppression of antinuclei formation in parton showers, provided that the dark mesons decay promptly into SM quarks, i.e. within a SM hadronization length.

We investigate DM production in a PBH-dominated cosmological framework, including contributions from PBH evaporation, gravitational production, and thermal freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms, and determine the regions consistent with the observed DM relic abundance. We find that thermal freeze-in can compensate for the underabundance of PBH-sourced DM, while indirect detection remains largely insensitive due to the feeble interaction strength, making future GW observatories such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope (ET) unique probes of this scenario. For freeze-out DM, indirect detection experiments constrain regions with relatively large annihilation cross-sections, whereas GW observations probe complementary regions with heavier DM masses and smaller interaction strengths. Consequently, the same DM parameter space cannot be simultaneously probed by both indirect detection searches and GW missions.

We study a minimal gauged $U(1)$ dark sector containing a dark Higgs and a dark photon, optionally supplemented by a vectorlike dark fermion, coupled to the Standard Model through Higgs portal or kinetic mixing. Using the Nielsen identity together with a controlled derivative expansion and power counting, we construct a gauge-independent effective action in the high- and low-temperature limits, enabling model-intrinsic nucleation dynamics and robust gravitational wave predictions.

The origin of these ``overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered ``overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M\\_{\\rm BH}/M\\_\\star$ ratios.

Over the past decade, growing observational evidence has suggested a possible continuity between slow- (IIP) and fast-declining (IIL) SNe. We investigate the continuity of the SNe IIP/L subclasses through a data-driven statistical analysis of spectral time series, aiming to determine whether significant correlations exist between overall spectral shapes and light-curve decline rates. We introduce a novel standardization method for SN II spectra. After empirically flattening the spectra via continuum normalization, we interpolate the resulting \"feature spectra\" onto a fixed grid of epochs using Gaussian Process regression. The interpolated spectra are then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to explore correlations. We find that SNe IIP and IIL form a continuum spectroscopically, though some clustering remains. The spectral diversity is characterized mainly by two components: one continuous group with well-defined P-Cygni profiles and another with \"less-regular\" features likely driven by enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. Our results reveal that the spectral diversity of SNe IIP/L diminishes over time. We confirm observational correlations: steeper light-curve declines correspond to weaker spectral features, indicating that SNe IIL tend to show weaker emission and, in some cases, a lack of distinct absorption lines. These trends seemingly break down by enhanced CSM interaction that affects the P-Cygni profiles.

The star-forming gas (SFG) in HII regions and young stars (YSs) trace the recent evolutionary history of the galaxy. We aim to assess the extent to which the joint analysis of metallicity gradient alignment in YSs and SFG can constrain the recent evolutionary history of galaxies. Using the high-resolution run of the EAGLE project, we derived radial, azimuthally averaged oxygen abundance profiles for YSs (age < 2 Gyr) and SFG and measured their gradients as the slopes of linear fits to these profiles. We classified galaxies into four groups based on the signs (N for negative and P for positive) of the slopes: NN, NP, PP, and PN (the first letter is for YSs and the second for SFG). We found that galaxies with NN, NP, PP, and PN combinations of metallicity profiles reflect different evolutionary paths over the past ~ 2 Gyr. NN galaxies exhibit sustained inside-out growth accompanied by high star formation efficiency, whereas NP and PP systems show evidence of recent or ongoing feedback-driven disruption, with PP galaxies likely being predominantly shaped by supernova feedback. PN galaxies, by contrast, show evidence of past violent events followed by gradient recovery, highlighting the interplay between inflows, feedback, and gas cooling in shaping metallicity distributions. The degree of alignment between the stellar and gas metallicity gradients provides a way to time the occurrence of significant events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, which contribute through a combination of gas inflows, star formation triggering, and metal mixing.

Our best-fit models include 15-22.5 Msun of ejecta enriched with 1.7 Msun of 56 Ni and carrying energy of 4 foe, and colliding w ith 7 Msun of circumstellar matter which match the observed light curve very well. The early data can be explained as cooling of an expanding shell with the mass of 0.5 Msun and kinetic energy of 0.7 foe. We tend to exclude a pulsational pair-instability (PPISN) origin for SLSN 2021bnw. Instead we conclude that SLSN 2021bnw was preferably a core-collapse explosion of a star with the initial mass of not less than 61 Msun aided by magnetorotational effects.\n\n", "2602.15165": "2026-02-16, **Three-Dimensional Kinematics of the Oxygen-rich Supernova Remnant G292.0+1.8**, Adele L. Plunkett et.al., [2602.15165v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15165v1)\n\n Studying the remnants of young core-collapse supernovae (SNe) can yield insight into the chemical composition of their progenitors and the geometry of the explosions. The supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8 is one of only three known oxygen-rich SNRs in the galaxy-remnants of core-collapse for which relatively pure fragments of ejecta can be seen. Several dozen ejecta knots from G292.0+1.8 were the subject of a proper motion analysis, based on [O III] 5007-Angstrom images taken over a 22-year baseline by Winkler et al. 2009 (arXiv:0810.1935). They determined that the transverse velocities of the filaments are linearly proportional to their distances from a common expansion center, thus the O-rich filaments have been traveling with little deceleration since the initial supernova event,about 3000 years ago. In this paper, we use optical spectra of G292.0+1.8, all taken from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), to measure radial velocities for 93 knots. Assuming un-decelerated expansion, as indi- cated by the proper motions, the radial velocity should be proportional to the distance from the center along the line of sight, just as the proper motions are proportional to the transverse distance. Therefore, we can map the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of the SNR. We find that the knots generally follow a broad bi-conical distribution, suggesting that the supernova explosion produced broad jets of ejecta. This structure is similar to that seen in some other young core-collapse supernova remnants.\n\n", "2602.14876": "2026-02-16, **Exploring the magnetic field of the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar NGC 4631 X-8**, Amar Deo Chandra et.al., [2602.14876v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14876v1)\n\n NGC 4631 X-8 is an ultraluminous X-ray pulsar (ULXP) having a spin period of about 9.7 s, discovered using XMM-Newton observations in 2025. The pulsar is known to show one of the largest spin-up rates ($\\sim 9.6 \\times 10^{-8}$ s s$^{-1}$) among the ULXP population. We explore the surface magnetic field of the neutron star in this source using different models, and find that the inferred magnetic field lies in the range of about $0.3-2 \\times 10^{14}$G. We study the long-term magnetic field and spin period evolution of the pulsar assuming steady accretion using prevalent theoretical mechanisms and find that the pulsar will evolve to become a millisecond pulsar having decayed magnetic field of about $\\sim 10^{9}$G in about a million years. The scenario of the formation of a millisecond pulsar is also probed using an estimate of the super-Eddington duty cycle of about 14% from the literature, which suggests that the neutron star would accrete sufficient matter to become a recycled millisecond pulsar. Exploring the magnetic field as well as the spin period evolution properties of ULXPs may enable us to understand the poorly understood evolutionary features of ULXPs, shed light on one of the pathways of millisecond pulsar formation and also help us to understand transient super-Eddington accretion phases in newborn magnetars, which are believed to power energetic events such as long gamma-ray bursts and Type I superluminous supernovae.\n\n", "2602.14781": "2026-02-16, **Evidence for the merger hypothesis in V4332 Sgr: a low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio and multiple outbursts**, D. P. K. Banerjee et.al., [2602.14781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14781v1)\n\n Following the detections of the first extragalactic ``Luminous Red Nova'' (LRN) M31 RV in 1989, and its first Galactic counterpart V4332~Sgr in 1994, there have been many discoveries of similar, or closely related, objects. They are important because they bridge the luminosity gap between the brightest novae and supernovae, a largely unexplored parameter space. The cause of eruptions in LRNe is still unclear, a stellar merger being the most favored mechanism. However, barring V1309~Sco, there has been no direct evidence for a merger in the other objects. Here we present strong evidence that V4332~Sgr was a merger event. High resolution infrared observations of the CO fundamental band show an unusually small $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $3.5\\pm1$. This indicates that a violent event had occurred, whose effects penetrated deep enough to allow CNO cycle processed $^{13}$C in the inner H burning shell to be brought to the surface. We rule out planetary ingestion, and propose that the eruption was due to a merger between V4332~Sgr and a companion star. It is shown that V4332~Sgr was likely surrounded by an edge-on disk before its eruption. If this disk was a flattened common envelope containing V4332~Sgr and a companion star, then a merger scenario would not be inconsistent. Furthermore, V4332~Sgr had multiple outbursts, previously unreported but an important piece of information, since multiple outbursts are a trait shared by many LRNe.\n\n", "2602.14640": "2026-02-16, **H.E.S.S. detection of the PSR J0855-4644 nebula**, F. Aharonian et.al., [2602.14640v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14640v1)\n\n HESS J0852-463 is a TeV \u03b3-ray source located in the Galactic plane. The region consists of a supernova remnant (SNR, RX J0852.0-4622) with a shell-like morphology, commonly referred to as Vela Junior, and a pulsar denoted PSR J0855-4644. Pulsars are among the most efficient leptonic accelerators in our Galaxy, making this region particularly interesting to study. We utilise the most recent data taken by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), to investigate any \u03b3-ray emission associated with the pulsar in this region, PSR J0855-4644. We applied a full forward folding method on the H.E.S.S. data. Utilising 3D modelling techniques, we evaluated the TeV \u03b3-ray emission towards the various components of this complex system. The distinct energy-dependent morphology observed in our data motivates further investigation of this source. We resolved the emission in the Vela Junior region into various components, several of which correspond to the SNR itself. In particular, we find a new extended component which is coincident with the position of PSR J0855-4644. The spectrum follows a power-law distribution with a best-fit index of \u0393E = 1.81 \\pm 0.07stat which differs from the properties of the surrounding \u03b3-ray emission of the Vela Junior SNR. A one-zone leptonic joint fit between the X-rays (from XMM-Newton) and \u03b3-rays (from H.E.S.S.) leads to a lower limit on the magnetic field of 1.6\u03bcG and a spectral index of \u03b1 = 1.88 \\pm 0.01, in line with expectations of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). In this paper, we report the first detection of the PWN of PSR J0855-4644 at TeV energies with the H.E.S.S. experiment at a significance of 12.2\u03c3. This is attributed to the advanced techniques of the 3D analysis. Based on the pulsar's characteristics, its PWN is consistent with the known TeV PWNe population in the Galaxy.\n\n", "2602.14427": "2026-02-16, **The Physical Properties of PS1-12sk and the Implications to Its Progenitor System**, Kai-Li Mi et.al., [2602.14427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14427v1)\n\n PS1-12sk is a type Ibn supernova (SN) found at the host environment showing no obvious ongoing star formation, which challenges the massive star explosion scenario. We use the ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction (CSI) and the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni models in the context of double white dwarf (WD) merger to fit the bolometric light curve (LC) of PS1-12sk, since the He emission lines at the photospheric phases indicated the interaction between the SN ejecta and He-rich CSM. We find that the CSI model failed to explain the LC, but the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni model can account for the bolometric LC. The derived masses of the two WDs and $^{56}$Ni are $\\sim 0.70 M\\_\\odot$, $\\sim 0.40 M\\_\\odot$, and $\\sim 0.09\\,M\\_\\odot$, respectively. The facts that the ejecta mass ($\\sim 0.984 M\\_\\odot$) is well below the Chandrasekhar limit ($\\sim 1.4 M\\_\\odot$) and that the $^{56}$Ni mass is comparable to the $^{56}$Ni yields of the explosions of some sub-Chandrasekhar explosion models support the scenario that PS1-12sk might be from a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion induced by the merger of two low-mass WDs. The derived innermost radius ($\\sim 13.81 \\times 10^{12}$ cm) and the mass of the CSM ($\\sim 0.116 M\\_\\odot$) disfavor the possibility that the CSM was formed in the merger phase. We suggest that the flybys before the merger can account for the position and mass of the CSM.\n\n"}}
