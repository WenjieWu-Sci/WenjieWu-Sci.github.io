Controlling the GFMC fermion-sign problem is crucial, as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases exponentially with Euclidean time, requiring significant computing resources. Inspired by similar scenarios in lattice quantum field theory and spin systems, in this work, we employ integration contour deformations to improve the GFMC signal-to-noise ratio. Machine learning techniques are used to select optimal contours with minimal variance from parameterized families of deformations. As a proof of principle, we consider the deuteron binding energies and Euclidean density response functions. We only observe mild signal-to-noise improvement for the binding energy case. On the other hand, we achieve an order of magnitude reduction of the variance for Euclidean density response functions, paving the way for computing electron- and neutrino-nucleus cross-sections of larger nuclei.\n\n", "2304.02997": "2023-04-06, **Right-Handed Neutrino Dark Matter with Forbidden Annihilation**, Yu Cheng et.al., [2304.02997v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02997v1)\n\n The seesaw mechanism with three right-handed neutrinos has one as a well-motivated dark matter candidate if stable and the other two can explain baryon asymmetry via the thermal leptogenesis scenario. We explore the possibility of introducing additional particles to make the right-handed neutrino dark matter in thermal equilibrium and freeze out through a forbidden annihilation channel. Nowadays in the Universe, this forbidden channel can be reactivated by a strong gravitational potential such as the supermassive black hole in our galaxy center. The Fermi-LAT gamma ray data and dark matter relic density require this right-handed neutrino dark matter to have mass below $100\\,$GeV and the existence of an additional boson $\\phi$ that can be tested at future lepton colliders.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2304.03160": "2023-04-06, **Searching for Primordial Black Holes with the Einstein Telescope: impact of design and systematics**, G. Franciolini et.al., [2304.03160v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03160v1)\n\n Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) have recently attracted much attention as they may explain some of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observations and significantly contribute to the dark matter in our universe. The next generation of Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors will have the unique opportunity to set stringent bounds on this putative population of objects. Focusing on the Einstein Telescope (ET), in this paper we analyse in detail the impact of systematics and different detector designs on our future capability of observing key quantities that would allow us to discover and/or constrain a population of PBH mergers. We also perform a population analysis, with a mass and redshift distribution compatible with the current observational bounds. Our results indicate that ET alone can reach an exquisite level of accuracy on the key observables considered, as well as detect up to tens of thousands of PBH binaries per year, but for some key signatures (in particular high--redshift sources) the cryogenic instrument optimised for low frequencies turns out to be crucial, both for the number of observations and the error on the parameters reconstruction. As far as the detector geometry is concerned, we find that a network consisting of two separated L--shaped interferometers of 15 (20)~km arm length, oriented at $45^{\\circ}$ with respect to each other performs better than a single triangular shaped instrument of 10 (15)~km arm length, for all the metrics considered.\n\n", "2304.02996": "2023-04-06, **Minihalos as probes of the inflationary spectrum: accurate boost factor calculation and new CMB constraints**, Guillermo Franco Abell\u00e1n et.al., [2304.02996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02996v1)\n\n Although the spectrum of primordial fluctuations has been accurately measured on scales above $\\sim 0.1~\\rm{Mpc}$, only upper limits exist on smaller scales. In this study, we investigate generic monochromatic enhancements to the $\\Lambda$CDM spectrum that trigger the collapse of ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs) well before standard structure formation. We refine previous treatments by considering a mixed population of halos with different density profiles, that should realistically arise as a consequence of late-time accretion and mergers. Assuming that dark matter (DM) can self-annihilate, we find, as expected, that UCMHs can greatly enhance the annihilation rate around recombination, significantly imprinting the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. However, we provide additional insight on the theoretical uncertainties that currently impact that boost and which may affect late-time probes such as the 21 cm line or $\\gamma$-ray signals. We derive constraints on the primordial power spectrum on small scales using the ExoCLASS/HYREC codes and the Planck legacy data. We account for the velocity dependence of the DM annihilation cross-section ($s$- or $p$-wave), annihilation channel, the DM particle mass and the inclusion of late-time halo mergers. Our $s$-wave constraints are competitive with previous literature, excluding primordial amplitudes $A\\_{\\star} \\gtrsim 10^{-6.5}$ at wavenumbers $k \\sim 10^4-10^7 \\ \\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. For the first time, we highlight that even $p$-wave processes have constraining power on the primordial spectrum for cross-sections still allowed by currently the strongest astrophysical constraints. Finally, we provide an up-to-date compilation of the most stringent limits on the primordial power spectrum across a wide range of scales.\n\n", "2304.02949": "2023-04-06, **Phase-space analysis of a novel cosmological model in $f(Q)$ theory**, Hamid Shabani et.al., [2304.02949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02949v1)\n\n The coincident gauges have been used solely while adopting the modified $f(Q)$ gravity theory to the cosmology. Consequently, researchers could not get beyond what is already known in $f(T)$ theory earlier. To alleviate this problem, in the present manuscript we investigate a novel construction of $f(Q)$ theory using non-vanishing affine connection in the spatially flat FLRW spacetime. We then investigate the cosmological solutions of $f(Q)$ theory for a perfect fluid through the phase space analysis. We introduce few variables and dimensionless parameters to construct the corresponding equations suitable for the dynamical system approach. The conservation of the energy-momentum tensor leads to a constraint equation that relates the dynamical variables. Briefly, there is a stable de Sitter solution which appears as either a point or a curve of equilibrium in the phase space. Also, unstable points corresponding to the matter dominated and radiation dominated eras have been found which do exist for every $f(Q)$ function. As a result, the present discussion shows that $f(Q)$ gravity endowed by non-vanishing affine connections is capable of explaining a true radiation-dark matter-accelerated expansion sequence.\n\n", "2304.02904": "2023-04-06, **Non-thermal Dark Matter via Lepton Portal: Hubble Tension and Stellar Cooling**, Zixuan Xu et.al., [2304.02904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02904v1)\n\n We propose a new non-thermal dark matter which feebly couples to the standard model charged leptons.The feeble interactions allow it $(1)$ to freeze-in from standard model thermal bath with its relic density being a partial or a whole of the observed dark matter density and $(2)$ to radiatively decay to two photons in the dark matter mass ranges of order keV scale with lifetime larger than the age of Universe.These features make this non-thermal dark matter a realistic realization of dark matter with late-time decay as a solution to Hubble tension.We show that the $68\\%$ CL best fit value of $H\\_{0}=68.3~(69.6)$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ compared to CMB+BAO (+LSS) data sets.We then use complimentary stellar cooling data to place stringent constraints on the parameter space.While the universal coupling scenario is excluded, the hierarchical coupling scenario can be tested by future observations on white dwarfs after a careful look into photon annihilation, Primakoff and Bremsstrahlung emission of the dark matter in various stellar systems.The viable parameter space may be linked to anomalies in future X-ray telescopes.\n\n"}, "supernova": {}}
