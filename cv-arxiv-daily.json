We develop wave perturbation theory to show that white noise density fluctuations generated by the interference of high-momenta waves are gravitationally unstable in the usual way during matter domination above the free streaming scale and stabilize below the free streaming scale, much like the analogous effects for massive neutrinos in hot dark matter. We verify and illustrate these effects in the density power spectra of Newtonian Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson simulations. In the cosmological context, this would cause a gradual suppression of the initial white noise isocurvature perturbations below the free streaming scale at matter radiation equality, unlike cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations, and virial stability of dark matter halos.\n\n", "2504.01893": "2025-04-02, **A minimal Pati-Salam theory: from cosmic defects to gravitational waves and colliders**, Goran Senjanovi\u0107 et.al., [2504.01893v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01893v1)\n\n We discuss a minimal renormalizable Pati-Salam theory based on the $SU(4)\\_{\\rm C}\\,\\times\\,SU(2)\\_{\\rm L}\\,\\times\\,SU(2)\\_{\\rm R}$ gauge group, with unification scale Higgs multiplets taken as $SU(2)\\_{\\rm L}$ and $SU(2)\\_{\\rm R}$ doublets, which lead to neutrino Dirac picture.

Moreover, phase transition in the early Universe leads to the production of magnetic monopoles and domain walls, both incompatible with the standard cosmological model. A small explicit breaking of the discrete left-right symmetry allows the domain walls to decay, and in the process possibly sweep away the monopoles, analogously to the previously discussed case of $SU(5)$ grand unified theory. This leaves an important imprint of gravitational waves, within the reach of next generation searches, correlated with monopole detection and new light particles at collider energies.

The detector consists of two sections: a target instrumented with SciFi modules and a hadronic calorimeter/muon detector. Energetic $\\nu$N collisions in the target produce hadronic showers. Reconstruction of the shower total energy requires an estimate of the fractions deposited in both the target and the calorimeter.

By using advanced machine learning techniques for neutrino momentum reconstruction, we achieve precise measurements of the full spin density matrix, a critical advantage over previous studies limited by reconstruction challenges for missing momenta. Our analysis reveals a clear observation of Bell nonlocality with high statistical significance, surpassing 5$\\sigma$, establishing $\\tau^+ \\tau^-$ as an ideal system for quantum information studies in high-energy collisions.

This leads to divergent RG functions for these fields and Yuwawa coupling matrices. We figure out that such infinite RG functions arise from the non-invariance of fields and Yukawa coupling matrices under field redefinitions, considering that flavor transformations are a kind of linear field redefinitions. Those infinite RG functions will disappear once one restores contributions from the derivative of renormalization constants with respect to the Wilson coefficients of redundant operators or, alternatively, considers the RGEs of flavor invariants, which are physical quantities and remain invariant under field redefinitions.\n\n", "2504.00358": "2025-04-01, **Nuclear Matrix Elements for Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay**, Anthony V.

While the primary halo mass-dependent bias has been studied in detailed, the secondary bias, which accounts for the additional dependencies on other internal halo properties, can offer a sensitive probe for testing gravity beyond the $\\Lambda$CDM model. To quantify any potential deviations between $\\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity models in halo clustering, at both the primary and secondary level, as well as in the distributions of halo properties in the cosmic web. Using $N$-body simulations of $f(R)$ gravity models, we assess the scaling relations and the primary and secondary bias signals of halo populations on the basis of a halo-by-halo estimator of large-scale effective bias. Our analysis is performed using halo number density as the independent variable. The relative difference in the effective bias between the $f(R)$ models and $\\Lambda$CDM is sensitive, albeit slightly, to the power index of modified gravity. The largest deviations from GR are measured for low-mass halos, where the average bias at fixed number density decreases by up to 5\\% for fixed scaling indices. We also show that the scaling relations for some environmental properties, including neighbour statistics, Mach number and local overdensity, exhibit small but non-negligible deviations (~3-5\\%) from GR for a wide range of number densities. Our results also suggests that the properties of halos in sheets and voids show the largest departures from GR (> 10\\% in some cases).

Thus, two energy scales naturally come into play: $\\rho\\_*$ is the scale at which the nonlinearity of the EoS becomes relevant; $\\rho\\_i$ is the energy scale around which the interaction starts to play an important role in the dynamics. Our focus is to understand whether there are parameter ranges for this system that can produce non-singular bouncing and emergent cosmologies for any initial condition. We complete a dynamical systems analysis, and find the parameter range such that trajectories always expand from a high energy non-singular de Sitter state. For flat and negative curvature models this de Sitter state is represented by a fixed point, the asymptotic past from which the universe emerges from. We find a subset of positive curvature models that during contraction get arbitrarily close to the de Sitter state, thus having a quasi-de Sitter bounce, then emerge from the bounce and expand, evolving toward spatial flatness. We find that the dimensionless parameter $q\\equiv \\rho\\_*/\\rho\\_i$, which measures the relative strength of the nonlinear terms in the system, plays a crucial role in the topology of the phase space. When $q < 3$, some trajectories expand toward a singularity, while others evolve toward a low energy cosmological constant at late-times, with a subset going through a decelerated matter dominate era before the final acceleration. When $q > 3$, all trajectories are non-singular, and evolve toward a late-time cosmological constant. We find a subclass in this case in which all trajectories have at least one decelerated matter dominated phase, and accelerate at late-times.\n\n", "2504.01669": "2025-04-02, **The CosmoVerse White Paper: Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics**, Eleonora Di Valentino et.al., [2504.01669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01669v1)\n\n The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys.

Among these LISA detectable events (LDEs), we select those that, based on their intrinsic properties are expected to be bright in one or more electromagnetic (EM) bands. We post-process these events with dust radiative transfer calculations to make predictions about their spectral energy distributions and continuum maps in the JWST to ALMA wavelength range. We compare the spectra arising from galaxies hosting the merging MBHs with those arising from AGN powered by single accreting BHs. We find that it will be impossible to identify an LDE from the continuum SEDs because of the absence of specific imprints from the merging MBHs. We also compute the profile of the H$\\_{\\rm \\alpha}$ line arising from LDEs, considering the contribution from their star-forming regions and the accreting MBHs. We find that the presence of two accreting MBHs would be difficult to infer even if both MBHs accrete at super-Eddington rates. We conclude that the combined detection of GW and EM signals from $z\\gtrsim 6$ MBHs is challenging not only because of the poor sky-localization provided by LISA, but also because the loudest GW emitters are not massive enough to leave significant signatures in the emission lines arising from the broad line region.\n\n", "2504.01070": "2025-04-01, **Formation and Environmental Context of Giant Bulgeless Disk Galaxies in the Early Universe: Insights from Cosmological Simulations**, Fangzhou Jiang et.al., [2504.01070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01070v1)\n\n Giant bulgeless disk galaxies, theoretically expected to be rare in the early Universe, have been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to exist as early as 2 billion years after the Big Bang.

However, while a significant number of FRBs are expected to exist at high redshift, detecting them has been difficult, with only a handful robustly confirmed at redshifts greater than one. In many other fields, gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters has enabled high redshift detections by magnifying background sources. In this work we forecast the populations of FRBs expected to be detected by CHIME and upcoming instrument CHORD, for blank fields and by lensing through a range of strong lensing galaxy clusters, based on existing, observationally driven cluster models. We find that the presence of a galaxy cluster of mass $M\\geq5\\times10^{14} M\\_\\odot$ within the detection beam of a transit telescope will approximately double the rate of detected high redshift ($z\\geq1$ CHIME, $z\\geq2$ CHORD) FRBs for that beam.

The assumptions we make is that the slow-roll era occurs, and that the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$ of the $F(R)$ gravity is positive or zero, for both the inflationary and late-time quasi de Sitter eras, a necessary condition for the stability of the de Sitter spacetime. In addition, we require that the de Sitter scalaron mass is also a monotonically increasing function of the Ricci scalar, or it has an extremum. Also the $F(R)$ gravity function is required to depend on the two known fundamental scales in cosmology, the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ and the mass scale $m\\_s^2=\\frac{\\kappa^2 \\rho\\_m^{(0)}}{3}$, with $\\rho\\_m^{(0)}$ denoting the energy density of the cold dark matter at the present epoch, that is $F(R)=F(R,\\Lambda,m\\_s^2)$.

By absorbing the cosmological constant into the effective impact parameter, we derive an analytical expression for the first part using elliptic integrals. Combined with the second part, we obtain a complete exact solution for the deflection angle in this context. Additionally, considering that the distances from the source to the observer are large, we derive expressions for the light deflection angle in both the weak and strong field limits.

For the missing energy scenario, the viable parameter space features ALP-SM and ALP-DM couplings: $g\\_{aWW} \\in (7.3 \\times 10^{-5} - 1.1 \\times 10^{-4})\\, \\text{GeV}^{-1}$ (from $B^\\pm \\to K^\\pm a$) and $g\\_{a\\chi\\chi} \\in (6.1\\times10^{-5} - 6.0\\times 10^{-3})\\, \\text{GeV}^{-1}$ (for resonant annihilation), accommodating ALP masses $m\\_a \\in (0.6, 4.8)\\, \\text{GeV}$. Therefore, this work establishes the ALP portal as a viable bridge between the $B^\\pm \\to K^\\pm \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ anomaly and thermal DM production, emphasizing precision calculations of thermal decoupling in resonance regimes.\n\n", "2504.00324": "2025-04-01, **Atmospheric absorption of dark matter**, Man Ho Chan et.al., [2504.00324v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00324v1)\n\n Typically, the interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter is assumed to be very small.

These can be measured with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), respectively. Here, we use recent DESI DR1, Pantheon+, SH0ES and DES-SN5YR data to test this fundamental relation. We employ a parametrised approach and also use model-independent Generic Algorithms (GA), which are a machine learning method where functions evolve loosely based on biological evolution. When we use DESI and Pantheon+ data without Cepheid calibration or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is a $2\\sigma$ violation of the DDR in the parametrised approach. Then, we add high-redshift BBN data and the low-redshift SH0ES Cepheid calibration. This reflects the Hubble tension since both data sets are in tension in the standard cosmological model $\\Lambda$CDM. In this case, we find a significant violation of the DDR in the parametrised case at $6\\sigma$. Replacing the Pantheon+ SNe Ia data by DES-SN5YR, we find similar results. For the model-independent approach, we find no deviation in the uncalibrated case and a small deviation with BBN and Cepheids which remains at 1$\\sigma$.

This raises questions on their progenitors and mass-loss processes shortly before the explosion. Recently, the bright long-lived Type~II SN 2021irp was proposed to be a standard Type II SN interacting with disk-like CSM. The observational properties suggest that the progenitor was a massive star in a binary system and underwent a mass-ejection process due to the binary interaction just before the explosion. Here, we study the diversity of the observational properties of bright long-lived Type II (21irp-like) SNe. We analyse the diversity of their CSM properties, in order to understand their progenitors and mass-loss mechanisms and their relations with the other types of interacting SNe. We performed photometry, spectroscopy, and/or polarimetry for four 21irp-like SNe. Based on these observations as well as published data of SN~2021irp itself and well-observed bright and long-lived type II SNe including SNe~2010jl, 2015da and 2017hcc, we discuss their CSM characteristics. This sample of SNe shows luminous and long-lived photometric evolution, with some variations in the photometric evolution (from $\\sim-17$ to $\\sim-20$ absolute mag in the $r$/$o$ band even at $\\sim 200$ days after the explosion).

It has been suggested that SNe Ia may be resulted from thermonuclear explosions of hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs(CONe WDs) when they grow in mass to approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit by accreting matter from a binary main-sequence (MS) companion. In this work, we combine the results of detailed binary evolution calculations with population synthesis models to investigate the rates and delay times of SNe Ia in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001. For a constant star formation rate of 5 M\\_sun yr-1, our calculations predict that the SN Ia rates in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001 is about 0.11 - 3.89 * 10-4 yr-1. In addition,delay times in this channel cover a wide range of 0.05 - 2.5 Gyr. We further compare our results to those given by previous study for the CONe WD + MS channel with higher metallicity of Z = 0.02 to explore the influence of metallicity on the results. We find that these two metallicity environments give a slight difference in rates and delay times of SNe Ia from the CONe WD + MS channel, although SNe Ia produced at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001 have relatively longer delay times.\n\n", "2504.01125": "2025-04-01, **Persistent radio sources associated with fast radio bursts: Implications from magnetar progenitors**, Sk.

PRSs are attributed to synchrotron emission from relativistic charged particles of magnetar wind nebula (MWN) powered by spin-down magnetohydrodynamic wind or internal magnetic field decay. Using a multizone hydrodynamic model, we track MWN evolution to constrain magnetar progenitor properties. For PRS1 and PRS2, we find an equipartition radius $R\\_\\mathrm{eq} \\sim 0.1 $ pc that is consistent with the radio scintillation estimates ($> 0.03$ pc) and radio imaging limits ($<0.7$ pc). This compact size favors low expansion speeds and large initial spin periods, $P\\_\\mathrm{i} \\gtrsim 10$ ms, ruling out millisecond magnetar progenitors.

Observations of SNe Iax provide insight into the physics of white-dwarf explosions and suggest that some may not be terminal events. Late-time photometry ($\\sim$1400 days post-peak) of the type Iax SN 2012Z, the only white dwarf supernova with a pre-explosion detection of a progenitor system, revealed a flux excess that may be explained by a gravitationally bound remnant driving a radioactively powered wind. We present further late-time Hubble Space Telescope photometry of SN 2012Z, $\\sim$2500 days after the explosion, and find that the SN is still brighter than, but trending towards, the pre-explosion flux. Additionally, we observe that the excess F555W flux seen in previous data has grown more pronounced. The color of the excess flux disfavors a light echo or interaction with the circumstellar material. The decline rate of the excess flux is consistent with energy deposition from $^{55}$Fe, but the luminosity is higher than expected from models of the ejecta, further suggesting evidence for a bound remnant. Combining our data with future observations should allow for the detection of emission from the ejecta shock-heating of the companion helium star seen in the progenitor system.\n\n", "2504.01068": "2025-04-01, **Cluster-lensed supernova yields from the Vera C.

This enables measurements of cosmological parameters, which will be increasingly important in light of upcoming telescopic surveys. We study the prospects of detecting strongly lensed SNe in cluster fields with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)'s High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We employed two approaches: one focusing on known multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters, along with the SN rates specific to those galaxies, and another based on the expected number of lensed SNe exploding in a given volume behind a galaxy cluster. We collected all the clusters in the literature that feature a well-constrained lens model and multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters with high-quality data for the lensed galaxies. This allowed us to determine the SN rate for each galaxy. We provide predictions for 46 clusters visible to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, as well as for 9 observable by Roman's HLTDS, depending on whether the clusters fall within the survey's observing field. We predict that the number of multiply imaged SNe discovered by LSST in its first three years is $3.95 \\pm 0.89$ from the first approach or $4.94 \\pm 1.02$ from the second. For the HLTDS, the expected number of multiply imaged SNe ranges from $0.38 \\pm 0.15$ to $5.2 \\pm 2.2$, depending on the specific cluster observed, however, the fields to be targeted remain a matter of discussion. We conclude that LSST offers great prospects for detecting multiply imaged SNe. Our predictions are effectively lower limits, as we only considered the most massive and well-studied clusters.

We define and normalize all criteria to ensure statistical consistency across the sample, with particular attention paid to the biases inherent in infant-based classification models. The top five SNe exhibit both high explosion energies (E > 1e51 erg) and extremely cool host galaxies (post transformation), with Claud.IA showing strong preferences toward galaxies exhibiting symmetric facial morphology and prominent spiral arms. Final application of Claud.IA identified the best supernova in our sample as SN 2022joj.

Although our conclusions depend on the choice of SNe sample, we consistently find a preference, as measured by the chi-squared statistic and the Bayesian evidence, for these dynamical dark energy models over the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model.
