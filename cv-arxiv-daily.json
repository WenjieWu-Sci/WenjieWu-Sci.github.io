This process is a significant background in neutrino oscillation experiments and studying it further is critical for the physics program of next-generation accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments.

We compare the results on a hydrocarbon target to the predictions of several neutrino interaction generators and final-state interaction models.

In this paper, we explore the cosmological implications of these data in combination with external Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and age-of-the-Universe information. The BAO measurement, which is $\\sim2\\sigma$ away from Planck's $\\Lambda$CDM predictions, pushes for low values of $\\Omega\\_{\\rm m}$ compared to Planck, in contrast to SN which prefers a higher value than Planck. We identify several tensions among datasets in the $\\Lambda$CDM model that cannot be resolved by including either curvature ($k\\Lambda$CDM) or a constant dark energy equation of state ($w$CDM). By combining BAO+SN+CMB despite these mild tensions, we obtain $\\Omega\\_k=-5.5^{+4.6}\\_{-4.2}\\times10^{-3}$ in $k\\Lambda$CDM, and $w=-0.948^{+0.028}\\_{-0.027}$ in $w$CDM.

In particular, we examine the ambiguity in the definition of the peculiar velocity contribution at linear level, whether it should be expressed in terms of the total matter velocity field or only the cold-matter component, comprised of cold dark matter and baryons. We revisit and extend previous qualitative studies on the topic with larger statistics and including a full fit of halo power spectrum and halo-matter cross-power spectrum measurements. We find clear evidence that the clustering of halos in redshift space is correctly described assuming that halo velocity is tracing the velocity field of cold-matter. The opposite assumption provides a worse fit to the simulated data and can lead to a spurious running of nuisance parameters in the perturbative galaxy power spectrum model.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2503.07277": "2025-03-10, **Emulating the Non-Linear Matter Power-Spectrum in Mixed Axion Dark Matter Models**, Dennis Fremstad et.al., [2503.07277v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07277v1)\n\n In order to constrain ultra light dark matter models with current and near future weak lensing surveys we need the predictions for the non-linear dark matter power-spectrum. This is commonly extracted from numerical simulations or from using semi-analytical methods. For ultra light dark matter models such numerical simulations are often very expensive due to the need of having a very low force-resolution often limiting them to very small simulation boxes which do not contain very large scales. In this work we take a different approach by relying on fast, approximate $N$-body simulations. In these simulations, axion physics are only included in the initial conditions, allowing us to run a large number of simulations with varying axion and cosmological parameters. From our simulation suite we use machine learning tools to create an emulator for the ratio of the dark matter power-spectrum in mixed axion models - models where dark matter is a combination of CDM and axion - to that of $\\Lambda$CDM. The resulting emulator only needs to be combined with existing emulators for $\\Lambda$CDM to be able to be used in parameter constraints. We compare the emulator to semi-analytical methods, but a more thorough test to full simulations to verify the true accuracy of this approach is not possible at the present time and is left for future work.\n\n", "2503.06968": "2025-03-10, **MaNGA DynPop -- VII.

Using a unified bulge-disk-halo model, we predict CVC shapes with minimal bias, identifying three governing parameters: bulge-to-total mass ratio ($B/T$), dark matter fraction within $R\\_{\\rm e}$, and bulge Sersic index. The distribution of CVC shapes across the mass-size plane reflects evolutionary pathways driven by (i) in situ star formation (spurring bulge growth) and (ii) dry mergers. This establishes CVC morphology as a diagnostic for galaxy evolution, linking dynamical signatures to structural and stellar population histories.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2503.07233": "2025-03-10, **Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae.

Here, we investigate narrow absorption features in the spectra of nearby supernovae (SNe) and compare them to local (< 0.5 kpc) and global host galaxy properties. With a large and heterogeneous sample of spectra, we are able to recover the known relations of ISM with galaxy properties: larger columns of ISM gas are found in environments that are more massive, more actively star-forming, younger and viewed from a more inclined angle. Most trends are stronger for local than global properties, and we find that the ISM column density decreases exponentially with the offset from the host galaxy centre, as expected for a gas distribution following an exponential radial profile. We also confirm trends for the velocity of galactic outflows increasing with radius. The current study demonstrates the capability of individual light sources to serve as ubiquitous tracers of ISM properties across various environments and galaxies.\n\n", "2503.07218": "2025-03-10, **Cosmic Ray bubbles from nova super remnants and their contribution to local cosmic ray spectra**, Rub\u00e9n L\u00f3pez-Coto et.al., [2503.07218v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07218v1)\n\n Context: Several new phenomena have been surrounding the area of study of the repeating thermonuclear explosions called novae. For example, recurrent novae have been proven to be efficient cosmic ray hadronic accelerators thanks to the recent observations of RS Ophiuchi by different gamma-ray instruments. Novae have also demonstrated to have the ability to carve large cavities into the Interstellar Medium with parallelisms with the remnants of supernovae. We aim at calculating what is the effect of novae in their surrounding media and to which distances these effects dominate over the average quantities that are measured in the ISM. We calculate the filling factor of novae and their contribution to cosmic ray fluxes using cosmic ray propagation codes. To limit what is the atomic density of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) surrounding the region around RS Oph, we use Fermi-LAT observations of the region. The filling factor of novae in the Galaxy is not significant under all assumptions done in the paper. They do not dominate over the local cosmic ray fluxes, even at the lowest energies, for distances larger than a few parsec. The particle density of the ISM surrounding them is, however, very much modified, lowering it more than one order of magnitude with respect to galactic averages, confirming estimates done using other observatories. As a conclusion, even though at global galactic distances, novae do not seem to be dominating cosmic ray transport, they have the power to modify the conditions of their surrounding ISM over parsec distances.\n\n", "2503.07205": "2025-03-10, **X-ray and radio data obtained by XMM-Newton and VLA constrain the stellar wind of the magnetic quasi-Wolf-Rayet star in HD45166**, P. Leto et.al., [2503.07205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07205v1)\n\n Recently, a powerful magnetic field was discovered in the hot helium star classified as a quasi-Wolf-Rayet star of ~2Msun, member of the HD45166 system. Upon its explosion as a core-collapse supernova, it is expected to produce a strongly magnetic neutron star, a magnetar. Among the key parameters governing the pre-supernova evolution is the amount of mass lost via stellar wind. However, the magnetic nature of this helium star is expected to affect its stellar wind making the estimation of the wind parameters uncertain. We report the first observations of HD45166 in X-rays with the XMM-Newton telescope and in radio with the VLA interferometer array. By placing the observation results in a theoretical framework, we aim to provide a reliable estimate of the wind strength of the magnetic qWR star. The X-ray properties are explained in the framework of the MCWS scenario, and the semi-analytic XADM model is applied to reproduce the X-ray emission. The thermal radio emission of the wind and its absorption effect on possible gyro-synchrotron emission from the underlying dipolar magnetosphere, sampled in 3D, are computed by integrating the radiative transfer equation. We did not detect radio emissions, this enabled us to set sensitive upper limits on the radio luminosity. The magnetic qWR star is a slow rotator, comparison with models reveals that the possible acceleration mechanisms occurring within its dynamical magnetosphere are not as efficient as in fast-rotating magnetic ApBp-type stars. In contrast, the system is detected in X-rays with log(L\\_X/L\\_bol)~ -5.6. Using suitable models, we constrain the mass lost from this magnetic quasi-Wolf-Rayet star as dot{M}~3e-10 Msun/yr. This novel empirical estimate of the mass-loss rate in a ~2Msun helium star confirms that it maintains super-Chandrasekhar mass till collapse and can produce a magnetar as its final evolutionary product.\n\n", "2503.07165": "2025-03-10, **Effect of Nuclear Deformation on Electron Capture Cross-section on Chromium Isotopes**, Asim Ullah et.al., [2503.07165v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07165v1)\n\n The electron capture plays significant role in the pre supernova and supernova evolutions of massive stars which in turn are of great importance in synthesizing heavy elements beyond iron. In this paper we study the effect of nuclear deformation on the computed electron capture cross section on selected even even chromium isotopes (464850Cr). The nuclear deformation parameters were computed using two different theoretical models: Interacting Boson Model (IBM 1) and Macroscopic (Yukawa plus exponential) microscopic (Folded Yukawa) model (Mac mic model). A third value of deformation parameter was adopted from experimental data. We chose the pn QRPA model to perform our calculations. The predictive power of the chosen model was first tested by calculating Gamow Teller (GT) strength distributions of selected fp shell nuclei where measured GT data was available. The calculated GT strength distributions were well fragmented over the energy range 0 12 MeV and were noted to be in decent agreement with experimental data. The total GT strength was found to increase (decrease) with decrease (increase) in the value of deformation parameter for the three chromium isotopes. The computed GT strength distributions satisfied the model independent Ikeda sum rule. The ECC were calculated as a function of the deformation parameter at core temperature 1.0 MeV. Our results show that the calculated ECC increased with increasing value of nuclear deformation.\n\n", "2503.06406": "2025-03-09, **Core Collapse Supernova Gravitational Wave Sourcing and Characterization based on Three-Dimensional Models**, R. Daniel Murphy et.al., [2503.06406v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06406v1)\n\n We present for the first time an analysis of high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) emission from proto-neutron stars (PNS) in core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) that combines spatial decomposition and modal decomposition to both source and characterize the emission. Our analysis is based on three-dimensional CCSN simulations initiated from two progenitors with differing mass and metallicity. We spatially decompose GW strains into five regions and show they are initially largest in the PNS surface layers from accretion and later largest from the Ledoux convective and convective overshoot regions within the PNS. We compute the fractional GW luminosity and observe that the majority of the luminosity moves from the same outer layers to deep within the PNS at comparable times. Using a self-consistent perturbative analysis, we investigate the evolution of the oscillation modes of the PNS. We find that the frequency of the evolving high-frequency component of the GW signal is well matched to the ${}^2g\\_2$-mode, the ${}^2g\\_1$-mode, and the ${}^2f$-mode over time. We show that the ${}^2g$-modes emit most of their power in GWs initially from the PNS surface region, but within a few 100 ms after bounce, it is the convective overshoot region of the PNS that emits the most GW power for the ${}^2g\\_1$-mode. Eventually, the ${}^2f$-mode is the dominant mode producing GWs, and they are emitted primarily from the convective overshoot region. Thus, with three interconnected analyses, we show that, while the GW emission is global, stemming from multiple regions in and around the PNS, we are able to source the dominant contributions to it. We find that high-frequency GW emission from the PNS in CCSNe is more complex than assessed by other methods, and dependent, first emitted mainly by ${}^2g$-modes driven by accretion onto the PNS and later emitted by the ${}^2f$-mode driven by sustained Ledoux convection.\n\n", "2503.06372": "2025-03-09, **Dwarf Active Galactic Nuclei from Variability for the Origins of Seeds (DAVOS): Properties of Variability-Selected AGNs in the Dark Energy Survey Deep Fields**, Yichen Liu et.al., [2503.06372v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06372v1)\n\n We study the black hole mass $-$ host galaxy stellar mass relation, $M\\_{\\rm{BH}}-M\\_{\\ast}$, for a sample of 706 $z \\lesssim 1.5$ and $i \\lesssim 24$ optically-variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in three Dark Energy Survey (DES) deep fields: C3, X3, E2, which partially cover Chandra Deep Field-South, XMM Large Scale Structure survey, and European Large Area ISO Survey, respectively.

Using publicly available spectra and photometric catalogs, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts, estimate their black hole masses using broad line widths and luminosities, and obtain improved stellar masses using spectral energy distribution fitting from X-ray to mid-infrared wavelengths. Our results confirm previous work from Hyper-Suprime Camera imaging that variability searches with deep, high-precision photometry can reliably identify AGNs in low-mass galaxies up to $z\\sim1$. However, we find that the hosted black holes are overmassive than predicted by the local AGN relation, fixing host galaxy stellar mass.
