MGR explicitly uses the smooth regular line element vector field $(\\bm{X},-\\bm{X}) $, which exists in all Lorentzian spacetimes, to construct a connection-independent symmetric tensor that represents the energy-momentum of the gravitational field. It solves the problem of the non-localization of gravitational energy-momentum in GR, preserves the ontology of the Einstein equation, and maintains the equivalence principle. The line element field provides MGR with the extra freedom required to describe dark energy and dark matter. An extended Schwarzschild solution for the matter-free Einstein equation of MGR is developed, from which the Tully-Fisher relation is derived, and the gravitational energy density is calculated. The mass of the invisible matter halo of galaxy NGC 3198 calculated with MGR is identical to the result obtained from GR using a dark matter profile. Although dark matter in MGR is described geometrically, it has an equivalent representation as a particle with the property of a vector boson or a pair of fermions; the geometry of spacetime and the quantum nature of matter are linked together by the unit line element covectors that belong to both the Lorentzian metric and the spin-1 Klein-Gordon wave equation.

Theoretical models of strange quark matter, such as the standard MIT bag model, the density-dependent quark mass model, or the quasi-particle model, however, appear to be unable to reproduce some of the properties (masses, radii and tidal deformabilities) of recently observed compact stars. This is different if alternative gravity theory (e.g., non-Newtonian gravity) or dark matter (e.g., mirror dark matter) are considered, which resolve these issues. The possible existence of strange stars could thus provide a clue to new physics, as discussed in this review.\n\n", "2304.09541": "2023-04-19, **Universality of Bose-Einstein Condensation and Quenched Formation Dynamics**, Nick P.

The results show that the oscillations of the resonances equal (up to numerical error) to the real parts of the QNFs, while the damping rates of the resonances equal to the imaginary parts of the QNFs. The QNMs and resonances, both of them can be regarded as the characteristic modes of the thick brane, are closely related with each other.

Our approach uses the recently proposed Laguerre reconstruction technique for the BAO feature and its linear point $r\\_{\\rm LP}$, and substantially extends it to simultaneously model the multipoles $\\ell=0,2,4$ of the anisotropic galaxy 2-point correlation function (2pcf). The approach is `model-agnostic': it assumes that the non-linear growth of structure smears the BAO feature by an approximately Gaussian kernel with a smearing scale $\\sigma\\_{\\rm v}$, but does not assume any fiducial cosmology for describing the shape of the feature itself. Using mock observations for two realistic survey configurations assuming $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM), combined with Bayesian parameter inference, we show that the linear point $r\\_{\\rm LP}$ and smearing scale $\\sigma\\_{\\rm v}$ can be accurately recovered by our method in both existing and upcoming surveys.

We point out that the branch of the PBH family that disappeared - PBHs lighter than $\\sim 10^9$g that ostensibly Hawking evaporated away in the early Universe - also constitute an interesting frontier for DM physics. Hawking evaporation itself serves as a portal through which such PBHs can illuminate new physics, for example by emitting dark sector particles. Taking a simple DM scalar singlet model as a template, we compute the abundance and mass of PBHs that could have provided, by Hawking evaporation, the correct DM relic density. We consider two classes of such PBHs: those originating from curvature perturbations generated by inflation, and those originating from false vacuum collapse during a first-order phase transition. For PBHs of both origins we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals emanating from their formation stage: from second-order effects in the case of curvature perturbations, and from sound waves in the case of phase transitions. The GW signals have peak frequencies in the MHz-GHz range typical of such light PBHs. We compute the strength of such GWs compatible with the observed DM relic density, and find that the GW signal morphology can in principle allow one to distinguish between the two PBH formation histories.\n\n", "2304.09035": "2023-04-18, **Evolution of matter and galaxy clustering in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations**, Jaan Einasto et.al., [2304.09035v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09035v1)\n\n We quantify the evolution of matter and galaxy clustering in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations via correlation and bias functions of matter and galaxies. We use simulations TNG100 and TNG300 with epochs from $z=5$ to $z=0$. We calculate spatial correlation functions of galaxies, $\\xi(r)$, for simulated galaxies and dark matter (DM) particles to characterise the evolving cosmic web. We find that bias parameters decrease during the evolution, confirming earlier results. At low and medium luminosities, bias parameters of galaxies, $b\\_0$, are equal, suggesting that dwarf galaxies reside in the same filamentary web as brighter galaxies. Bias parameters of the lowest luminosity galaxies estimated from CFs are lower relative to CFs of particle density-limited clustered samples of DM. We find that bias parameters $b\\_0$, estimated from CFs of clustered DM, agree with the expected values from the fraction of particles in the clustered population, $b=1/F\\_c$. The cosmic web contains filamentary structures of various densities, and fractions of matter in the clustered and the unclustered populations are both less than unity. Thus the CF amplitude of the clustered matter is always higher than for all matter, i.e. bias parameter must be $b>1$. Differences between CFs of galaxies and clustered DM suggest that these functions describe different properties of the cosmic web.\n\n", "2304.08888": "2023-04-18, **LIGO-VIRGO constraints on dark matter and leptogenesis triggered by a first order phase transition at high scale**, Debasish Borah et.al., [2304.08888v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08888v1)\n\n We study the possibility of constraining a scenario with high scale first order phase transition (FOPT) responsible for the cogenesis of baryon and dark matter using gravitational wave (GW) (non)-observations.

The dark matter is preferred to be in the non-thermal ballpark with sub-GeV masses and the criteria of successful dark matter relic rules out a large portion of the parameter space consistent with high scale FOPT and successful leptogenesis. Some part of the parameter space allowed from dark matter and leptogenesis criteria also gives rise to a large signal-to-noise ratio at ongoing experiments and hence can be disfavoured in a conservative way from the non-observation of such stochastic GW background.

The gas pressure responds to changes in the gravitational potential of the cluster, which is dominated by the host dark matter halo. Changes in halo concentration therefore impact the SZ signal, with implications for cosmological and other analyses of SZ-selected clusters. We investigate the concentration-SZ relation in theory and simulations. We find that the impact of concentration on the inner SZ profile ($R \\lesssim 0.75 R\\_{200c}$) can be captured with standard polytropic gas models. However, we find that such models do a poor job of reproducing the outer SZ profiles ($R \\gtrsim 0.75 R\\_{200c}$) and the relation between the integrated SZ signal, $Y$, and concentration. This disagreement results from a sharp truncation of the gas pressure profile near the splashback radius, likely caused by virial shocks. We develop a simple description of the truncation that leads to a good match with simulated SZ profiles out to several $R\\_{200c}$ for clusters of varying mass and concentration, and that also accurately predicts the concentration-$Y$ relationship.

We turn to the sensitive MeerKAT telescope and, combined with historic Parkes data, leverage PSR J1933$-$6211's kinematic and relativistic effects to constrain its 3D orbital geometry and the component masses. We obtain precise proper motion and parallax estimates, and measure their effects as secular changes in the Keplerian orbital parameters: a variation in orbital period of $7(1) \\times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$ and a change in projected semi-major axis of $1.60(5) \\times 10^{-14}$ s s$^{-1}$. A self-consistent analysis of all kinematic and relativistic effects yields a distance of $1.6^{+0.2}\\_{-0.3}$ kpc, an orbital inclination, $i = 55(1)$ deg and a longitude of the ascending node, $\\Omega = 255^{+8}\\_{-14}$ deg.

They are excellent cosmological distance indicators due to the remarkable homogeneity of their light curves. However, the nature of the progenitors of SNe Ia is still not well understood. In the single-degenerate model, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) could grow its mass by accreting material from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, leading to the formation of SNe Ia when the mass of the WD approaches to the Chandrasekhar-mass limit, known as the AGB donor channel. In this channel, previous studies mainly concentrate on the wind-accretion pathway for the mass-increase of the WDs. In the present work, we employed an integrated mass-transfer prescription for the semidetached WD+AGB systems, and evolved a number of WD+AGB systems for the formation of SNe Ia through the Roche-lobe overflow process or the wind-accretion process. We provided the initial and final parameter spaces of WD+AGB systems for producing SNe Ia. We also obtained the density distribution of circumstellar matter at the moment when the WD mass reaches the Chandrasekhar-mass limit.

Later the lower mass star engulfs the NS as it becomes a red giant, a process that leads to the second CEE phase and to the ejection of the envelope. This leaves a hot horizontal branch star that evolves to become a helium WD and an expanding nebula. Both the WD and the NS power the nebula. The NS in addition might power a pulsar wind nebula inside the expanding PN.

There is a possibility that one of the observed Galactic PNe might be a NS-WD PN, and a few NS-WD PNe might exist in the Galaxy. The central binary systems might be sources for future gravitational wave detectors like LISA, and possibly of electromagnetic telescopes.\n\n", "2304.08776": "2023-04-18, **Hot and highly magnetized neutron star matter properties with Skyrme interactions**, Omar G. Benvenuto et.al., [2304.08776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08776v1)\n\n We study the properties of hot and dense neutron star matter under the presence of strong magnetic fields using two Skyrme interactions, namely the LNS and the BSk21 ones. Asking for $\\beta$--stability and charge neutrality, we construct the equation of state of the system and analyze its composition for a range of densities, temperatures and magnetic field intensities of interest for the study of supernova and proto-neutron star matter, with a particular interest on the degree of spin-polarization of the different components. The results show that system configurations with larger fractions of spin up protons and spin down neutrons and electrons are energetically favored over those with larger fractions of spin down protons and spin up neutrons and electrons. The effective mass of neutrons and protons is found to be in general larger for the more abundant of their spin projection component, respectively, spin down neutrons and spin up protons. The effect of the magnetic field on the Helmhotz total free energy density, pressure and isothermal compressibility of the system is almost negligible for all the values of the magnetic field considered.\n\n"}}
