Bhupal Dev et.al., [2407.12738v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12738v1)\n\n Neutrinophilic mediators are well-motivated messenger particles that can probe some of the least known sectors of fundamental physics involving nonstandard interactions of neutrinos with themselves and potentially with dark matter. In particular, light mediators coupling to the active neutrinos will induce new decay modes of the Standard Model mesons (e.g., $\\pi^\\pm, K^\\pm \\to \\ell^\\pm + \\nu + \\phi$), charged leptons (e.g., $\\tau^\\pm \\to \\pi^\\pm + \\nu + \\phi$), and gauge bosons (e.g., $Z \\to \\nu + \\bar{\\nu} + \\phi$). A common lore is that these decays suffer from infrared divergences in the limit of the vanishing mediator mass, i.e., $m\\_\\phi \\to 0$. Here, we show for the first time that including the 1-loop contributions of these mediators to the standard 2-body decays (e.g., $\\pi^\\pm,\\,K^\\pm \\to \\ell^\\pm + \\nu$, etc.), the infrared divergence from the 3-body decay cancels out exactly by virtue of the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem. Including these cancellation effects, we then update the existing laboratory constraints on neutrinophilic scalar mediators, thereby extending the limits far beyond the decaying parent particle mass and excluding a wider range of parameter space. These new \"physical\" limits derived here have significant implications for the future detection prospects of nonstandard neutrino (self-)interactions.\n\n", "2407.12694": "2024-07-17, **Neutrino Halo profiles: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis**, Beatriz Hern\u00e1ndez-Molinero et.al., [2407.12694v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12694v1)\n\n Using the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations, we computed neutrino profiles within virialized dark matter haloes. These new high-resolution simulations allowed us to revisit fitting formulas proposed in the literature and provided updated fitting parameters that extend to less massive haloes and lower neutrino masses than previously in the literature, in accordance with new cosmological limits. The trend we observe for low neutrino masses is that, for dark matter halo masses below $\\sim 4\\times10^{14}$$h^{-1}M\\_\\odot$, the presence of the core becomes weaker and the profile over the whole radius is closer to a simple power law. We also characterized the neutrino density profile dependence on the solid angle within clustered structures: a forward-backward asymmetry larger than 10% was found when comparing the density profiles from neutrinos along the direction of motion of cold dark matter particles within the same halo. In addition, we looked for neutrino wakes around halo centres produced by the peculiar motion of the halo itself. Our results suggest that the wakes effect is observable in haloes with masses greater than $3\\times10^{14}$ $h^{-1}M\\_\\odot$ where a mean displacement of $0.06$\\hmpc was found.\n\n", "2407.12573": "2024-07-17, **Neutrino beaming in ultraluminous X-ray pulsars as a result of gravitational lensing by neutron stars**, Alexander A. Mushtukov et.al., [2407.12573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12573v1)\n\n X-ray pulsars experiencing extreme mass accretion rates can produce neutrino emission in the MeV energy band. Neutrinos in these systems are emitted in close proximity to the stellar surface and subsequently undergo gravitational bending in the space curved by a neutron star. This process results in the formation of a distinct beam pattern of neutrino emission and gives rise to the phenomenon of neutrino pulsars. The energy flux of neutrinos, when averaged over the neutron star's pulsation period, can differ from the isotropic neutrino energy flux, which impacts the detectability of bright pulsars in neutrinos. We investigate the process of neutrino beam pattern formation, accounting for neutron star transparency to neutrinos and gravitational bending. Based on simulated neutrino beam patterns, we estimate the potential difference between the actual and apparent neutrino luminosity. We show that the apparent luminosity can greatly exceed the actual luminosity, albeit only in a small fraction of cases, depending on the specific equation of state and the mass of the star. For example, the amplification can exceed a factor of ten for $\\approx0.2\\%$ of typical neutron stars with mass of $1.4\\,M\\_\\odot$. Strong amplification is less probable for neutron stars of higher mass. In the case of strange stars, a fraction of high energy neutrinos can be absorbed and the beam pattern, as well as the amplification of apparent neutrino luminosity, depend on neutrino energy.\n\n", "2407.12544": "2024-07-17, **Two-field inflation from one complex scalar with symmetry breaking**, Yoshihiko Abe et.al., [2407.12544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12544v1)\n\n We study two-field inflation derived from a single complex scalar with a nonzero vacuum expectation value.

We categorize the potential trajectories of the two inflaton fields and determine the parameter regions consistent with current observational data.

We will construct a Lagrangian formalism to include these scalar fields in a theory of gravity coupled with ordinary matter and radiation. We will find that these fields need not to be included in the actions of interacting gauge theories coupled with conserved fermionic vector currents as a part of the connection. The same remains valid for ordinary scalar fields. We can couple the connection-scalars with ordinary matter by adding suitable interaction terms. In this context, we will find that Stokes' theorem leads us to include the right-handed neutrinos in the electroweak theory in curved spacetime even with the Levi-Civita connection. This is required to obtain consistent equations of motion and anomaly-free conserved vector current for the neutrinos. Axial vector currents for different Dirac fields may remain anomalous. The right-handed neutrinos can be useful to explain neutrino oscillation and dark matter.

This paper details the equalization of the response to charge in the ICARUS time projection chamber (TPC), as well as data-driven tuning of the simulation of ionization charge signals and electronics noise. The equalization procedure removes non-uniformities in the ICARUS TPC response to charge in space and time. This work leverages the copious number of cosmic ray muons available to ICARUS at the surface. The ionization signal shape simulation applies a novel procedure that tunes the simulation to match what is measured in data.

The CEvNS signature will be measured with the same four point-contact high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors produced for the former experiment, however refurbished and with optimized low energy thresholds. To suppress the background in the CONUS+ detectors, the passive and active layers of the original CONUS shield were modified such to fit better to the significantly changed background conditions at the new experimental location. New data acquisition and monitoring systems were developed. A direct network connection between the experiment and the Max-Planck-Institut fur Kernphysik (MPIK) makes it possible to control and monitor data acquisition in real time.

This dependency is particularly relevant when the neutrino mass matrix has a generic structure, introducing uncertainty in the prediction of nucleon decay branching fractions within flipped SU(5). In this paper, we demonstrate that this uncertainty can be parametrized using two parameters, which can be determined by measuring the partial lifetimes of $p \\to \\pi^0 e^+$, $p \\to \\pi^0 \\mu^+$, and $n \\to \\pi^0 \\bar{\\nu}$.

While knot-like excitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the fundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary particles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the appearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear as meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of particle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This result suggests that during the early Universe, a \"knot dominated era\" may have existed, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this scenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we propose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum tunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle physics and represent a modern version of Kelvin's hypothesis.\n\n", "2407.11410": "2024-07-16, **High-energy neutrino emission from tidal disruption event outflow-cloud interactions**, Hanji Wu et.al., [2407.11410v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11410v1)\n\n Tidal disruption events (TDEs), characterized by their luminous transients and high-velocity outflows, have emerged as plausible sources of high-energy neutrinos contributing to the diffuse neutrino.

We model the galaxy as a two-component system consisting of stars and gas in equilibrium with an external dark matter halo. We derive the equations governing the growth of perturbations and obtain a stability criterion that connects the potential of the dark matter halo and the gas fraction with the stability levels of the galaxy. We find that a two-component disc is more susceptible to the growth of gravitational instabilities than individual components, particularly as gas fractions increase. However, the external field, due to the dark matter halo, acts as a stabilizing agent and increases the net stability levels even in the presence of a cold gas component. We apply the stability criterion to models of the Milky Way, low surface brightness galaxies, and baryon-dominated cold rotating disc galaxies observed in the early universe. Our results show that the potential due to the dark matter halo plays a significant role in stabilizing nearby galaxies, such as the Milky Way, and low surface brightness galaxies, which would otherwise be prone to local gravitational instabilities.

Two different star formation models are compared, a model based on a local gravo-thermo-turbulent condition and a model based on a sink particle algorithm. Using idealized tests of collapsing isothermal spheres and giant molecular clouds with different turbulent structures, we determine the optimal accretion radius to be twice the cell size and the resolution required to achieve reasonable convergence in star formation efficiency to 0.3 pc for the sink algorithm. As a first study in this series, we use cosmological zoom-in simulations with different spatial resolutions and find that star formation is more bursty in the runs with the sink algorithm, generating stronger outflows than in the runs with the gravo-thermo-turbulent model. The main reason for the increased burstiness is that the gas accretion rates on the sinks are high enough to form stars on very short timescales, leading to more clustered star formation. As a result, the star-forming clumps are disrupted more quickly in the sink run due to more coherent radiation and supernova feedback. The difference in burstiness between the two star formation models becomes even more pronounced when the supernova explosion energy is artificially increased.

We focus on static, asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric black holes and naked singularities supported by a real self-gravitating scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. We consider the influence of dark matter on the tidal forces caused by the central objects and some features of the motion of matter near these configurations. It turns out, first, that the event horizon radius of a scalar field black hole can be arbitrarily small as well as the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, and tidal forces near this orbit can be very large. Second, we show that if strongly gravitating objects in the centers of galaxies are naked singularities, then bright flares (tidal disruption events) in the nuclei of galaxies can be explained in different way. In the vicinity of a scalar field naked singularity, baryonic matter is concentrated in the gravitational potential well forming a \"gray shell\" consisting of cold compressed matter.

The analytic formulae are calibrated against a large set of spherically symmetric multi-group (frequency-dependent) calculations for a wide range of progenitor parameters (mass, radius, core/envelope mass ratios) and explosion energies. In these calculations we use the opacity tables we constructed (and made publicly available), that include the contributions of bound-bound and bound-free transitions. They reproduce the numeric $L$ and $T\\_{\\rm col}$ to within 10\\% and 5\\% accuracy, and the spectral energy distribution to within $\\sim20-40\\%$. The accuracy is similar to that achieved for RSG explosions.\n\n", "2407.12302": "2024-07-17, **Superluminous supernovae**, Takashi J. Moriya et.al., [2407.12302v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12302v1)\n\n Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a population of supernovae (SNe) whose peak luminosities are much larger than those of canonical SNe. Although SLSNe were simply defined by their peak luminosity at first, it is currently recognized that they show rich spectroscopic diversities including hydrogen-poor (Type I) and hydrogen-rich (Type II) subtypes. The exact mechanisms making SLSNe luminous are still not fully understood, but there are mainly four major suggested luminosity sources (radioactive decay of 56Ni, circumstellar interaction, magnetar spin-down, and fallback accretion). We provide an overview of observational properties of SLSNe and major theoretical models for them. Future transient surveys are expected to discover SLSNe at high redshifts which will provide a critical information in revealing their nature.\n\n", "2407.12284": "2024-07-17, **Blue supergiants as a progenitor of intermediate-luminosity red transients**, Takashi J. Moriya et.al., [2407.12284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12284v1)\n\n The current perspective about the explosions of blue supergiants is that they resemble SN 1987A. These so-called peculiar Type II supernovae, however, are one of the rarest types of supernovae and may not hence be the fate of all blue supergiants. In this work, we explore other explosion scenarios for blue supergiants. We create synthetic light curves from the explosions of blue supergiant models born from binary mergers, over a range of explosion energies and 56Ni masses. We find that blue supergiant explosions may also lead to intermediate-luminosity red transients. We thus identify two categories of supernovae possible from blue supergiant explosions: those with high 56Ni masses (> ~ 0.01 Msun) result in slow-rising, dome-shaped light curves like SN 1987A. Lower 56Ni masses result in low-luminosity, short-plateau light curves resembling some intermediate-luminosity red transients and Type II supernovae like SN 2008bp, which are possible from the explosions of compact blue supergiants and not from the far more extended red supergiants. Our results indicate that blue supergiant explosions are more diverse than SN 1987A-like events and may be hidden among different kinds of transients, explaining the possible discrepancies between the expected fraction of blue supergiants born from binary mergers and the observed fraction of SN 1987A-like supernovae.\n\n", "2407.12250": "2024-07-17, **Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with Type Ia supernova and transverse BAO measurements**, Min Wang et.al., [2407.12250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12250v1)\n\n In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the angular diameter distance (ADD) derived from the transverse Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data with the luminosity distance (LD) from the Pantheon type Ia supernova (SNIa) sample. The binning method and Gaussian process are employed to match ADD data with LD data at the same redshift. First, we use nonparametric and parametric methods to investigate the impact of the specific prior values of the absolute magnitude $M\\_{\\rm B}$ from SNIa observations and the sound horizon scale $r\\_{\\rm s}$ from transverse BAO measurements on the CDDR tests. The results obtained from the parametric and non-parametric methods indicate that specific prior values of $M\\_{\\rm B}$ and $r\\_{\\rm s}$ lead to significant biases on the CDDR test. Then, to avoid these biases, we propose a method independent of $M\\_{\\rm B}$ and $r\\_{\\rm s}$ to test CDDR by considering the fiducial value of $\\kappa\\equiv10^{M\\_{\\rm B} \\over 5}r\\_{\\rm s}$ as a nuisance parameter and then marginalizing its influence with a flat prior in the analysis. No violation of the CDDR is found, and the transverse BAO measurement can be used as a powerful tool to verify the validity of CDDR in the cosmological-model-independent method.\n\n", "2407.12090": "2024-07-16, **Impact of star formation models on the growth of galaxies at high redshifts**, Cheonsu Kang et.al., [2407.12090v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12090v1)\n\n To understand the impact of star formation models on galaxy evolution, we perform cosmological zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of a dwarf dark matter halo with virial mass 1e9 Msun at z=6. Two different star formation models are compared, a model based on a local gravo-thermo-turbulent condition and a model based on a sink particle algorithm. Using idealized tests of collapsing isothermal spheres and giant molecular clouds with different turbulent structures, we determine the optimal accretion radius to be twice the cell size and the resolution required to achieve reasonable convergence in star formation efficiency to 0.3 pc for the sink algorithm. As a first study in this series, we use cosmological zoom-in simulations with different spatial resolutions and find that star formation is more bursty in the runs with the sink algorithm, generating stronger outflows than in the runs with the gravo-thermo-turbulent model. The main reason for the increased burstiness is that the gas accretion rates on the sinks are high enough to form stars on very short timescales, leading to more clustered star formation. As a result, the star-forming clumps are disrupted more quickly in the sink run due to more coherent radiation and supernova feedback. The difference in burstiness between the two star formation models becomes even more pronounced when the supernova explosion energy is artificially increased. Our results suggest that improving the modelling of star formation on small, sub-molecular cloud scales can significantly impact the global properties of simulated galaxies.\n\n", "2407.11428": "2024-07-16, **Dynamical system analysis in modified Galileon cosmology**, L.

We focus on the exponential type function of $F(\\phi)$ and the three well-motivated potential functions $V(\\phi)$. We obtain the critical points of the autonomous system, along with their stability conditions and cosmological properties. The critical points of the autonomous system describe different phases of the Universe. In the results of our analysis, we have found the scaling solution for critical points, which determine different evolutionary eras for the Universe. The dark-energy-dominated critical points show stable behavior and indicate the Universe's late-time cosmic acceleration phase.

For approximately 385 days following the explosion, SN 2021dbg exhibited remarkable luminosity, surpassing most SNe II. This initial high luminosity is potentially attributed to the interaction between the ejected material and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), as evidenced by the pronounced interaction signatures observed in its spectra. The subsequent high luminosity is primarily due to the significant $^{56}$Ni ($0.17 \\pm 0.05$ M$\\_{\\odot}$) produced in the explosion. Based on the flux of flash emission lines detected in the initial spectra, we estimate that the CSM mass near the progenitor amounted to $\\sim$(1.0--2.0) $\\times 10^{-3}$ M$\\_{\\odot}$, likely resulting from intense stellar wind activity 2--3 yr preceding the explosion. Considering the bolometric light curve, nebular spectrum modeling, and mass-loss rate, we suggest that the progenitor of SN 2021dbg was a red supergiant (RSG) with a mass of $\\sim 20$ M$\\_{\\odot}$ and a radius of 1200 R$\\_{\\odot}$. This RSG featured a thick hydrogen shell, which may have contained a region with a sharp decrease in material density, electron density, and temperature, contributing to its layered structure. This object demonstrates mixed features of SNe IIP and SNe IIL, making it as a transitional event linking the above two subclasses of SNe II.\n\n"}}
