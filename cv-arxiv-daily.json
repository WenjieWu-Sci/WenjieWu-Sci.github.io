The Mitchell Institute Neutrino Experiment at Reactor (MINER), conducted at the Nuclear Science Center of Texas A&M University, investigated ALPs near a 1 MW TRIGA nuclear reactor core, positioned approximately 4 meters away. This experiment employed cryogenic sapphire detectors with a low detection threshold (approximately 100 eV), equipped with a Transition Edge Sensor capable of detecting athermal phonons. Due to the low-background environment, we were able to exclude ALPs with axion-photon coupling and axion-electron coupling as small as \\(g\\_{a\\gamma\\gamma} = 10^{-5}\\) and \\(g\\_{aee} = 10^{-7}\\), respectively. Energy depositions below 3 keV were not considered and remain blinded for our Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) analysis.

Ahlen et.al., [2504.20338v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20338v1)\n\n The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is a massively parallel spectroscopic survey on the Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak, which has released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations determined from over 14 million extragalactic targets. We combine DESI Data Release 2 with CMB datasets to search for evidence of matter conversion to dark energy (DE), focusing on a scenario mediated by stellar collapse to cosmologically-coupled black holes (CCBH). In this physical model, which has the same number of free parameters as $\\Lambda$CDM, DE production is determined by the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), allowing for distinct early- and late-time cosmologies. Using two SFRDs to bracket current observations, we find that the CCBH model: accurately recovers the cosmological expansion history, agrees with early-time baryon abundance measured by BBN, reduces tension with the local distance ladder, and relaxes constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\\sum m\\_\\nu$. For these SFRDs, we find a peaked positive $\\sum m\\_\\nu < 0.149\\,\\rm eV$ (95\\% confidence) and $\\sum m\\_\\nu = 0.106^{+0.050}\\_{-0.069}\\,\\rm eV$ respectively, in good agreement with lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments.

We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.\n\n", "2504.20163": "2025-04-28, **Implications of the KM3NeT Ultrahigh-energy Event on Neutrino Self-interactions**, Yuxuan He et.al., [2504.20163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20163v1)\n\n Neutrino self-interactions ({\\nu}SI) mediated by light bosonic particles can produce characteristic spectral dips in astrophysical neutrino fluxes, thereby modifying the expected energy spectrum.

In this work, we investigate two implications of this observation under the assumption that the event originates from a diffuse power-law spectrum.

Many previous studies have suggested that fast flavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner regions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process nucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI and CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background obtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special attention to a case involving a long-lived ($>1\\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can occur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple mechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number angular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ notably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We also find that the appearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for FFI, which offers a valuable diagnostic tool for predicting FFI based solely on fluid properties. For CFI, their growth rates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of the accretion disk up to $\\sim 1\\,$ s. We also find that neglecting contributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate and area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends to occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and FFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI, though more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor conversions are needed to confirm these claims.\n\n", "2504.20044": "2025-04-28, **How Charged Can Neutrinos Be?**, Sudip Jana et.al., [2504.20044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20044v1)\n\n We investigate how neutrinos may acquire small electric charges within the Standard Model framework while preserving electromagnetic gauge invariance. Instead of gauging the standard hypercharge generator $Y$, a linear combination of $Y$ and a new generator $X$ from a gaugable global $U(1)\\_X$ symmetry is embedded, under which neutrinos transform non-trivially. We demonstrate that minimal scenarios based on flavor-dependent $U(1)\\_X$ symmetries, such as $X = L\\_\\alpha - L\\_\\beta$, are incompatible with current neutrino oscillation data.

We also discuss the necessary connection between such charges and the Dirac nature of neutrinos. By analyzing the phenomenological implications in detail, our findings emphasize that constraints on neutrino charges should be evaluated within the specific framework of the $U(1)\\_X$ symmetry under consideration, rather than assuming a generic approach, as is often the case.\n\n", "2504.20038": "2025-04-28, **Unified and consistent structure growth measurements from joint ACT, SPT and \\textit{Planck} CMB lensing**, Frank J.

Each of these surveys individually provides lensing measurements with similarly high statistical power, achieving signal-to-noise ratios of approximately 40.

Orlando et.al., [2504.19896v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19896v1)\n\n Supernova (SN) 1987A provides a unique window into the aftermath of a massive stellar explosion, offering key insights into the ejecta's morphology, composition, explosion mechanism, progenitor system, and circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction. We investigate large-scale ejecta asymmetries in SN 1987A. By comparing the simulations with JWST observations and making predictions for XRISM, we aim to refine our understanding of the explosion mechanism and the remnant's evolution. We performed 3D MHD simulations that trace the evolution of SN 1987A from the SN to the SNR, extending our predictions up to 5000 years into the future and considering the Ni-bubble effects. The simulation results are compared with JWST observations and used to predict XRISM spectra, to evaluate the accuracy of the modeled ejecta structure. Our simulations reproduce the large-scale Fe-rich ejecta morphology seen by JWST, revealing two clumps suggestive of a bipolar explosion. Ni-bubble effects in the first year boost Fe-rich ejecta expansion and their interaction with the reverse shock. However, discrepancies with JWST observations in clump velocities and spatial distribution suggest stronger explosion asymmetries than modeled. Since 2021, our models predict that shocked ejecta have contributed increasingly to X-ray emission, now rivaling shocked CSM and soon dominating as the latter fades. Future XRISM observations will trace the evolution of these ejecta structures, refining constraints on explosion geometry. Early remnant asymmetries from CSM interaction may persist for at least 100 years. Our results underscore the role of asymmetric core-collapse mechanisms in shaping SN 1987A's ejecta and constraining its explosion geometry. Future studies should explore more extreme asymmetries, in neutrino-driven core collapse or magneto-rotational SN models, to identify the origin of its bipolar Fe-rich structure.\n\n", "2504.19697": "2025-04-28, **Rescuing leptogenesis in inverse seesaw models with the help of non-Abelian flavor symmetries**, Yan Shao et.al., [2504.19697v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19697v1)\n\n The inverse seesaw (ISS) model provides an attractive framework that can naturally explain the smallness of neutrino masses while accommodating some sterile neutrinos potentially accessible at present or future experiments. However, in generic ISS models with hierarchical pseudo-Dirac (PD) sterile neutrino pairs, the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via the leptogenesis mechanism is extremely challenging. In this paper, we investigate rescuing leptogenesis in the ISS model with the help of non-Abelian flavor symmetries which have the potential to explain the observed peculiar neutrino mixing pattern: we first implement non-Abelian flavor symmetries to naturally enforce mass degeneracies among different pseudo-Dirac sterile neutrino pairs and then break them in a proper way so that resonant leptogenesis among different PD sterile neutrino pairs can arise, thus enhancing the generated baryon asymmetry. To be specific, we have considered the following two well-motivated approaches for generating the tiny mass splittings among different PD sterile neutrino pairs: one approach makes use of the renormalization-group corrections to the sterile neutrino masses, while the other approach invokes non-trivial flavor structure of the $\\mu^{}\\_{\\rm s}$ matrix.

By compiling numerical simulation results for stellar collapse, we predict the expected neutrino emission and compare these predictions with observational limits from Super-Kamiokande (SK). The simulations reveal a characteristic precursor signal consisting of a short, intense burst whose average neutrino energy rises rapidly and then ceases abruptly once the black hole forms. We examine several nuclear equations of state, specifically the Lattimer \\& Swesty, Shen, Togashi, and SFHo models, to evaluate how the emission depends on neutron-star properties and nuclear-physics uncertainties. Comparison of the predicted event counts with SK's non-detection of neutrinos coincident with M31-2014-DS1 already rules out part of the model space and highlights the sensitivity of current neutrino detectors to both progenitor mass and the EOS.

This relation exhibits small scatter, thus providing key constraints for models of galaxy formation and evolution -- allowing us to map the distribution of dark matter in galaxies -- as well as models of modified dynamics. However, it has only been extensively studied in the very local Universe with largely heterogeneous samples. We present a new measurement of the RAR, utilising a homogeneous, unbiased sample of H{\\sc i}-selected galaxies. We introduce a novel approach of measuring resolved stellar masses using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting across 10 photometric bands to determine the resolved mass-to-light ratio, which we show is essential for measuring the acceleration due to baryons in the low-acceleration regime. We find that the stellar mass-to-light ratio varies across galaxies and radially, favouring lower mass-to-light ratios compared to previous studies. Our results reveal a tight RAR with a low-acceleration power-law slope of $\\sim 0.5$, consistent with previous studies. Adopting a spatially varying mass-to-light ratio yields the tightest RAR with an intrinsic scatter of only $0.045 \\pm 0.022$ dex.

These events offer the potential to search for signatures of physics beyond the standard model, including dark matter. We present the first numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers admixed with dark matter, based on constraint-solved initial data. Modeling dark matter as a non-interacting fermionic gas, we investigate the impact of varying dark matter fractions and particle masses on the merger dynamics, ejecta mass, post-merger remnant properties, and the emitted gravitational waves. Our simulations suggest that the dark matter morphology - a dense core or a diluted halo - may alter the merger outcome. Scenarios with a dark matter core tend to exhibit a higher probability of prompt collapse, while those with a dark matter halo develop a common envelope, embedding the whole binary. Furthermore, gravitational wave signals from mergers with dark matter halo configurations exhibit significant deviations from standard models when the tidal deformability is calculated in a two-fluid framework. This highlights the need for refined models in calculating the tidal deformability when considering mergers with extended dark matter structures.

This data complete the phase-space information for all known dwarf galaxies around M83 down to a completeness of $-$10 mag in the $V$ band. All studied objects have an intermediate to old and metal-poor stellar population and follow the stellar luminosity-metallicity relation as defined by the Local Group dwarfs. For the stellar stream we serendipitously identify a previously unknown globular cluster, which is old and metal-poor. Two dwarf galaxies (NGC5264 and dw1341-29) may be a bound satellite of a satellite system due to their proximity and shared velocities.

This formalism represents a class of the so-called logotropic fluids, and allows explaining an accelerating late-time universe.

We consider entropic cosmology and describe the evolution of the late time universe in the presence of dark matter coupled with viscous dark energy. In order to obtain a more detailed picture of its evolution, we add in our model a coupling of the log-corrected power-law fluid with dark matter, and study various interacting forms between them. We solve the system of dynamic equations for viscous dark fluid coupled with dark matter and obtain expressions for the log-corrected power-law dark energy density, and the energy density for dark matter. The research results are presented in holographic form in terms of generalized holographic cut-offs introduced by Nojiri and Odintsov [2, 3].

Disentangling their contributions is essential for understanding galaxy evolution and constructing accurate mass models of the MW. We analyze the time-dependent structure of MW-mass halos from zoomed cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations by decomposing their mass distribution into spherical harmonic expansions. We find that the dipole ($\\ell=1$) and quadrupole ($\\ell=2$) moments dominate the gravitational power spectrum, encoding key information about the halo's shape and its interaction with the cosmic environment. While the dipole reflects transient perturbations from infalling satellites and damps on dynamical timescales, the quadrupole -- linked to the halo's triaxiality -- is a persistent feature. We show that the quadrupole's orientation aligns with the largest filaments, imprinting a long-lived memory on the halo's morphology even in its inner regions ($\\sim30$ kpc). At the virial radius, the quadrupole distortion can reach 1-2 times the spherical density, highlighting the importance of environment in shaping MW-mass halos.

We find that the quadrupolar response induced by LMC-mass satellites has an order of magnitude larger gravitational power than in spherically symmetric MW models.

While a significant part of this integral can be solved in closed form under traditional assumptions of the standard halo model and/or isotropic detector response, analysis of alternate assumptions is conventionally impeded by the inefficiency of multidimensional numerical integration methods. In this work we introduce a novel, fast and efficient algorithm for direct detection event rate computations. This algorithm takes advantage of a closed form expression for the Radon transform of three dimensional Zernike functions, which are used as basis functions for the velocity distribution.

However, the interaction of particles of the surrounding medium with the solitons should affect their dynamics. In the paper, we consider the interaction between domain walls and scalar particles which can play a role of dark matter. It is shown that when the temperature of the scalar particle gas, caused by the expansion of the Universe, decreases below a certain threshold value, the wall abruptly becomes opaque and locks particles inside itself. We discuss the dynamics of a single domain wall taking into account pressure of scalar particles locked inside a closed wall. It is shown, this effect leads to a time delay of domain wall collapse and the deferred formation of primordial black holes.\n\n", "2504.19505": "2025-04-28, **Exploring Ultralight Dark Matter Self-Coupling via the Gravitational Wave Background**, Pratick Sarkar et.al., [2504.19505v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19505v1)\n\n Supermassive black hole binary mergers serve as prominent sources of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs).

In particular, ultralight dark matter (ULDM) forming compact solitonic cores around supermassive black holes can imprint signatures in PTA observations. Our analysis places limits on the mass and self-interaction strength of ULDM, demonstrating that soliton-induced dynamical friction can significantly alter the SGWB spectrum.

In this work, we propose an agnostic test that simultaneously constrains the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) and probes the possibility of a transition between the quintessence and phantom regimes, or vice versa. Our initial approach is independent of physical priors, allowing the data to determine which behavior best fits the parameters. We then consider a minimally modified gravity theory known as VCDM, into which we can map our initial approximation, placing it within a theoretically stable framework. To this end, we incorporate the most up-to-date datasets available, including BAO measurements from DESI-DR2, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3 samples, as well as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck.

It is important to determine which Galactic cosmic-ray sources can accelerate particles to the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum at a few PeV, and in particular whether supernova remnants may contribute. Current models for particle acceleration in very young remnants assume the circumstellar material consists of smooth, freely expanding winds. There is strong evidence that some supernovae expand into much denser circumstellar material including dense shells ejected by eruptions shortly before explosion.   Aims. We investigate the effects of dense circumstellar shells on particle acceleration in supernova shocks during the first few years post-explosion, to quantify whether such interaction supernovae may act as PeVatrons.   Methods. We used the pion code to model the circumstellar medium around Luminous Blue Variables after having a brief episode with a mass-loss rate of up to dM/dt = 2Msol/yr. Consequently, we performed spherically symmetric 1-D simulations using our time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC in which we simultaneously solve the transport equations for cosmic-rays, magnetic turbulence, and the hydrodynamical flow of the thermal plasma in the test-particle limit.   Results. We find that the interaction with the circumstellar shells can significantly boost the maximum energy by enhancing particle escape during the onset of the shock-shell interaction followed by the reacceleration of the shock propagating into a medium with a pre-amplified field. Early interactions boost the maximum energy to a greater degree and interactions within the first 5 months after explosion can increase Emax to more then 1 PeV.\n\n", "2504.20574": "2025-04-29, **Two Decades of Dust Evolution in SN 2005af through JWST, Spitzer, and Chemical Modeling**, Arkaprabha Sarangi et.al., [2504.20574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20574v1)\n\n The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A.

In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust is formed in the ejecta, where the total mass of ejecta dust is about 0.02-0.03 Msun, while in the circumstellar medium the amount of surviving oxygen-rich dust is 0.001-0.004 Msun.\n\n", "2504.20407": "2025-04-29, **Discovery of a variable yellow supergiant progenitor for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo**, Zexi Niu et.al., [2504.20407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20407v1)\n\n We report the discovery of a progenitor candidate for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo using multi-epoch pre-explosion images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey.

However, there are selected cases, where solid target is hardly be produced. Such a case is in particular, when the target is noble gas. In many astrophysical scenarios, such as big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), stellar hydrogen burning, and supernova explosions, alpha induced reactions on noble gas nuclei play a crucial role. Studying these reactions in the laboratory requires these noble gas atoms to be confined in a sufficient amount to allow the reactions. For example, in case of the $^3$He($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction, both reactants are noble gases. The reaction cross section was experimentally determined in several works, however there are still energy regions lacking experimental data, rendering the extrapolations towards the astrophysically relevant energies uncertain.

We focus on the high temperature plasma ($kt\\sim 4.5$keV) that is responsible for the high energy continuum and exciting the Fe K emission. An image analysis shows that the Fe K emission is mainly concentrated in the southern part of the remnant interior to the region defined by the forward shock. This Fe K distribution would be consistent with an asymmetric distribution of the Fe ejecta and/or an asymmetric interaction between the reverse shock and the Fe ejecta. We compare the EPIC-pn and EPIC-MOS spectra in the 3.0 -- 12.0keV bandpass with a model based on RGS data plus a higher temperature component, in collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE), or non-equilibrium (NEI) (both ionizing and recombining). We find that the data are equally well-fitted by the CIE and ionizing models. Assuming the CIE and ionizing spectral models, the Fe in this high temperature component is significantly enhanced with respect to typical LMC abundances. We can place only an upper limit on the neutral Fe K line. We conclude that the Fe~K emission is due to ejecta heated by the reverse shock given the spatial distribution, relatively high temperature, and enhanced abundance.
