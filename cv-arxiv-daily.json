Using a set of lightcones produced with the ``Dark Energy and Massive Neutrino Universe'' $N$-body simulations we study how different dark energy models and neutrino masses impact the properties of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects, focusing on the signal arising from galaxy clusters and groups. We analyse the distribution of values, Compton-$y$ parameter for the thermal SZ effect and $\\Delta T/T$ for the kinematic SZ effect, and study their angular power spectra. We find that the distribution of logarithmic Compton parameter can be fitted with a skewed Gaussian, with a mean that, at fixed dark energy model, decreases linearly with an approximate slope of $10 f\\_\\nu$. Regarding the power spectrum of the thermal SZ effect, we find that an increase in $\\sum {m\\_\\nu}$ is observed as a power-law scaling with respect to $\\sigma\\_8^{\\mathrm{cb}}$, with exponents ranging from 7.2 to 8.2. We also find that four cosmological models, one with $\\sum {m\\_\\nu} = 0.16$ eV and three with $\\sum {m\\_\\nu} = 0.32$ eV, fit equally well the Planck data for the Compton-$y$.

We work beyond the simplified assumption of a single heavy Majorana neutrino mixing with the active sector, considering potential interference effects when including two nearly degenerate heavy Majorana neutrinos. Particularly, we provide a first estimate of the decay channels involving different flavors for the external leptons (e.g., muon-tau), and elaborate on the interference pattern due to leptons exchange. We show that the results for the two heavy almost degenerate neutrinos can be recast into a single Majorana neutrino, and exhibit the features for both the LNC and LNV scenarios. We determine the potential exclusion region for the mass and heavy-light mixing parameters, of the neutrinos driving the decay, including finite size detector effects.

We notice that if high-energy protons responsible for neutrino emission are accelerated close to the surface of the accretion disk, the neutrino flux may have no unambiguously identifiable electromagnetic counterpart. This is because the electromagnetic power released in interactions of high-energy protons would only contribute to the heating of the disk surface and corona above the disk, rather than escape from the source. Given that the heat deposited in the corona is released in the hard X-ray range we notice that there still might be an \"indirect\" electromagnetic counterpart of the neutrino signal: the hard X-ray flux variability may be strongly or weakly correlated with the neutrino flux variations, depending on the importance of the high-energy proton heating in the disk/corona heat balance. If heating by high-energy protons provides a sizable contribution to the overall corona heating rate, the overall flux of diffuse GeV neutrino background from Seyfert galaxies may be comparable to the X-ray background flux and the high-energy tail of this background can provide a sizable contribution to the astrophysical neutrino flux in the TeV band.\n\n", "2503.16213": "2025-03-20, **Search for heavy neutral leptons in decays of W bosons using leptonic and semi-leptonic displaced vertices in $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector**, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., [2503.16213v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16213v1)\n\n A search is performed for long-lived heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), produced through the decay of a $W$ boson along with a muon or electron.

The original evolution mapping framework exploits a degeneracy in the linear matter power spectrum when expressed in ${\\rm Mpc}$ units, which compresses its dependence on cosmological parameters into those that affect its shape and a single extra parameter $\\sigma\\_{12}$, defined as the RMS linear variance in spheres of radius $12 {\\rm Mpc}$.

This methodology has been integrated into the public COMET package, enhancing its ability to emulate predictions of state-of-the-art perturbative models for galaxy clustering, such as the effective field theory (EFT) model. Additionally, the updated software now accommodates a broader cosmological parameter space for the emulator, enables the simultaneous generation of multiple predictions to reduce computation time, and incorporates analytic marginalisation over nuisance parameters to expedite posterior estimation. Finally, we explore the impact of different infrared resummation techniques on galaxy power spectrum multipoles, demonstrating that any discrepancies can be mitigated by EFT counterterms without impacting the cosmological parameters.\n\n", "2503.16124": "2025-03-20, **Effects of tau-neutrino detection on non-standard interactions at DUNE with a short discussion on the nature of neutrino mixing**, Xin Yue Yu et.al., [2503.16124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16124v1)\n\n In this paper, we investigate the effects of $\\nu\\_\\tau$ and $\\bar{\\nu}\\_\\tau$ detection at the DUNE far detector on the experiment's sensitivity to Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) in neutrino propagation.

Previous analyses that combined Planck measurements with eBOSS Lyman-$\\alpha$ likelihoods based on earlier simulations found a preference for neutrino self-interactions.

Because LIV effects grow with energy, high-energy astrophysical neutrinos provide the most sensitive tests of Lorentz invariance in the neutrino sector.

Using the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, i.e., the abundances of $\\nu\\_{e}$, $\\nu\\_{\\mu}$, and $\\nu\\_{\\tau}$ across the sky, we find no evidence of LIV-induced flavor anisotropy in 7.5 years of IceCube High-Energy Starting Events.

In this work, we examine the possibility of replacing the currently proposed likelihood-based reconstruction method with an approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). As the likelihood-based reconstruction method is reasonably accurate but computationally expensive, one of the benefits of a Machine Learning (ML) based method is enabling fast event reconstruction in the detector development phase, allowing for easier investigation of the effects of changes to the detector design. Focusing on classification of flavour and interaction type in muon and electron events and muon- and electron neutrino interaction events, we demonstrate that the GNN reconstructs events with greater accuracy than the likelihood method for events with greater complexity, and with increased speed for all events. Additionally, we investigate the key factors impacting reconstruction performance, and demonstrate how separation of events by pion production using another GNN classifier can benefit flavour classification.\n\n", "2503.15047": "2025-03-19, **Measurement of the A dependence of the muon neutrino charged-current quasielastic-like cross section as a function of muon and proton kinematics at $<$E$_\u03bd>\\sim$6 GeV**, J.

No solar model has yet been able to simultaneously reproduce the solar lithium and beryllium abundances, along with helioseismic results, including the rotation profile. Lithium and beryllium are fragile elements that are highly sensitive to the physical conditions, as well as to transport and mixing processes within and below the convective zone (CZ). Uncovering the transport mechanisms responsible for the depletion of Li and Be in the Sun is crucial for using them as tools to understand stellar interiors and the associated transport and mixing processes. We constructed rotating solar models based on Magg's abundance scale, incorporating the effects of convective overshoot and magnetic fields. The rotating model exhibits superior sound speed and density profile and successfully reproduces the observed ratios $r\\_{02}$ and $r\\_{13}$. It also matches the seismically inferred CZ depth, surface helium abundance, and rotation profile, as well as the detected Li and Be abundances and neutrino fluxes within $1\\sigma$. The depletion of Li is dominated by convective overshoot and rotational mixing, while Be depletion is primarily driven by gravitational settling and rotational mixing.

The time-variation of the dark matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results.

Key to the success of these analyses is the control of potential sources of systematic uncertainty. As an example, the presence of baryons can alter the cluster sparsity with respect to predictions from N-body simulations. Similarly, a radial dependent mass bias, as in the case of masses inferred under the hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) hypothesis, can affect sparsity estimates. We examine the imprint of baryonic processes on the sparsity statistics. Then, we investigate the relation between cluster sparsities and gas mass fraction. Finally, we perform a study of the impact of HE mass bias on sparsity measurements and the implication on cosmological parameter inference analyses. We use catalogues of simulated galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred project and run a comparative analysis of the sparsity of clusters from N-body/hydro simulations implementing different feedback model scenarios. Sparsities which probe the mass profile across a large radial range are affected by the presence of baryons in a way that is particularly sensitive to astrophysical feedback, whereas those probing exclusively external cluster regions are less affected. In the former case, we find the sparsities to be moderately correlated with measurements of the gas fraction in the inner cluster regions. We infer constraints on $S\\_8$ using synthetic average sparsity measurements generated to evaluate the impact of baryons, selection effects and HE bias. In the case of multiple sparsities these lead to highly bias results. Hence, we calibrate linear bias models that enable us to correct for these effects and recover unbiased constraints that are significantly tighter than those inferred from single sparsity analyses.\n\n", "2503.16173": "2025-03-20, **Precision cross-sections for advancing cosmic-ray physics and other applications: a comprehensive programme for the next decade**, D.

This study evaluates the potential of TianQin in detecting IMBBHs from Pop III star clusters, focusing on key factors such as the detection horizon, detection number, and Fisher uncertainty. Methods. A Monte Carlo simulation is employed to derive IMBBH sources, utilizing the IMRPhenomD waveform model to simulate catalogs of observable IMBBH mergers. The mass and redshift distributions are derived from direct N-body simulations of IMBBHs in Population III star clusters. Detection numbers are determined by calculating the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the simulated signals and applying thresholds for detection.

The findings suggest that TianQin could achieve detection numbers within 5 years ranging from 1 in the most pessimistic scenario to 253 in the most optimistic scenario.

The assembly merger tree goes from the linear perturbations in the early universe to highly non linear structures at late times. Gravity is the driving force and self-similarity should inform cosmic haloes. However, it is unclear if apparent anomalies at non-linear scales are due to either baryonic or new physics. Here, I show that the mass distribution of rich haloes evolve self-similarly at least since the universe was 5.7 Gyr old.

However, a largely underutilized probe of PBH abundance is the temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM), inferred from the thermal broadening of absorption lines in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest of quasar spectra. PBHs inject energy into the IGM via Hawking radiation, altering its thermal evolution. In this work, we constrain this energy injection by self-consistently modeling its interplay with the cosmological ultraviolet background from galaxies and supermassive black holes. Leveraging IGM temperature measurements spanning the past twelve billion years ($z \\sim 0$ to $6$), we derive one of the most stringent constraints on PBH-induced heating from light PBHs within the mass range $10^{15}\\unicode{x2013}10^{17}$ g.

This enables us to identify ram-pressure evaporation - the scattering of satellite and host dark matter particles - as the primary source of the enhanced mass loss. The rapid disintegration of the Sgr progenitor when self interactions are allowed alters some key properties of the resulting stellar stream, most dramatically suppressing the presence of a \"spur\" on the apocenter of the trailing stream arm that correlates with the mass of the satellite at last pericenter. We demonstrate how the effects on the Sgr system scale with the particular choice of self-interaction cross section, which affects the degree of ram-pressure evaporation.

Modelling of gravitational lenses is fundamental to estimate the total mass of the lens galaxy, along with its dark matter content. Traditional modelling of gravitational lenses is computationally intensive and requires manual input. In this paper, we use a Bayesian neural network, LEns MOdelling with Neural networks (LEMON), for modelling Euclid gravitational lenses with a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile. Our method estimates key lens mass profile parameters, such as the Einstein radius, while also predicting the light parameters of foreground galaxies and their uncertainties. We validate LEMON's performance on both mock Euclid data sets, real Euclidised lenses observed with Hubble Space Telescope (hereafter HST), and real Euclid lenses found in the Perseus ERO field, demonstrating the ability of LEMON to predict parameters of both simulated and real lenses. Results show promising accuracy and reliability in predicting the Einstein radius, axis ratio, position angle, effective radius, S\\'ersic index, and lens magnitude for simulated lens galaxies. The application to real data, including the latest Quick Release 1 strong lens candidates, provides encouraging results, particularly for the Einstein radius.

A key component of Euclid's observational strategy is slitless spectroscopy, conducted using the Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). This technique enables the acquisition of large-scale spectroscopic data without the need for targeted apertures, allowing precise redshift measurements for millions of galaxies. These data are essential for Euclid's core science objectives, including the study of cosmic acceleration and the evolution of galaxy clustering, as well as enabling many non-cosmological investigations. This study presents the SIR processing function (PF), which is responsible for processing slitless spectroscopic data. The objective is to generate science-grade fully-calibrated one-dimensional spectra, ensuring high-quality spectroscopic data. The processing function relies on a source catalogue generated from photometric data, effectively corrects detector effects, subtracts cross-contaminations, minimizes self-contamination, calibrates wavelength and flux, and produces reliable spectra for later scientific use. The first Quick Data Release (Q1) of Euclid's spectroscopic data provides approximately three million validated spectra for sources observed in the red-grism mode from a selected portion of the Euclid Wide Survey. We find that wavelength accuracy and measured resolving power are within requirements, thanks to the excellent optical quality of the instrument.

Low-mass galaxies have low baryonic fractions which increase to a maximum for masses near $10^{12}\\ M\\_{\\odot}$, and decreases thereafter with increasing galaxy mass. This trend is generally attributed to the action of feedback from star formation at the low end and of active galactic nuclei at the high-mass end. An alternative is that the baryonic fraction is at least partially due to the ability of galaxies to competitively accrete gas in a group or clustered environment. Most galaxies in a group including those of lower masses, orbit the cluster centre at significant speeds and hence their accretion is limited by a Bondi-Hoyle type process, $\\dot{M}\\_{acc} \\propto M\\_{DM}^2$. In contrast, the few high-mass galaxies reside in the core of the cluster and accrete in a tidal accretion process, $\\dot{M}\\_{acc} \\propto M\\_{DM}^{2/3}$.

Wave optics effects, such as diffraction, make the lensing effect sensitive to the structure around the Fresnel scale, which depends on the gravitational wave frequency and is typically sub-Galactic for realistic observations. Contrary to this common lore, we show that wave optics can, in principle, probe matter perturbations even below the Fresnel scale. This is achieved by introducing a new quantity derived from the amplification factor, which characterizes the lensing effect, and analyzing its correlation function. Our results demonstrate that this quantity defines an effective Fresnel scale: a characteristic scale that can be arbitrarily small, even when observational frequencies are bounded. In practice, the effective Fresnel scale is constrained by the observation time $T$ and is suppressed by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{fT}$ relative to the standard Fresnel scale at frequency $f$. Nevertheless, it remains significantly smaller than the conventional Fresnel scale for $fT \\gg 1$; for instance, in one-year observations of mHz GWs, the effective Fresnel scale can be as small as 1 pc.

These new ingredients are key to understand PNS oscillation modes, in particular those related to the standing-accretion-shock instability (SASI). Their incorporation is an important step towards accurate PNS asteroseismology. For this purpose, we perform linear and adiabatic perturbations of a spherically symmetric background, in the relativistic Cowling approximation, and cast the resulting equations as an eigenvalue problem. We discretize the eigenvalue problem using collocation Chebyshev spectral methods, which is then solved by means of standard and efficient linear algebra methods. We impose boundary conditions at the accretion shock compatible with the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions.

We analyzed its multi-wavelength light curve, which exhibited a possible period modulation that could result from a geometrical effect. Methods. We analyzed the modulation present at all available bands in SN 2015ap's light curves using a Bayesian approach for measuring the period of variability. Additionally, narrow Ha emission is observed in late-time spectra, exhibiting periodic velocity shifts likely originating from hydrogen gas stripped from a companion and accreted onto the compact remnant. Results. We propose that SN 2015ap's significant light curve modulation arise from accretion onto a neutron star as the remnant of SN 2015ap. Our multi-wavelength observations reveal a sinusoidal modulation with a period of 8.4 days, confirmed by periodic variations in the Ha emission lines. Traditional models of circumstellar medium interactions cannot account for these features due to the unusually high ejection rates required. Using the Taylor-Spruit dynamo model, we suggest that the interaction between accreting matter and the neutron star's magnetosphere could account for the observed periodic modulation. This implies assuming an ejecta-companion interaction because the accretion from fallback ejecta alone would not produce the observed modulation.

Of these candidates, we find 93 nebulae that have [SII]/H${\\alpha}$ ratios that exceed 0.4, the traditional ratio used to separate SNRs from HII regions, strongly suggesting that at least these objects are SNRs. Our high resolution spectroscopy reveals 108 nebulae that have velocity widths in H${\\alpha} $ (full-width at 20% peak flux) that exceed 50 km s$^{-1}$, significantly larger than found in HII regions. There are 72 objects that satisfy both tests. Here we discuss the spectroscopic characteristics of all of the objects in our sample, and the likelihood that other objects in the sample of Lee et al. are also SNRs, and we briefly consider confirmation by X-ray, radio and UV observations. We also discuss several new candidates that have been identified serendipitously in the course of examining a large amount of archival Hectospec data.\n\n", "2503.15334": "2025-03-19, **Euclid: Quick Data Release (Q1) -- Photometric studies of known transients**, C. Duffy et.al., [2503.15334v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15334v1)\n\n We report on serendipitous Euclid observations of previously known transients, using the Euclid Q1 data release. By cross-matching with the Transient Name Server (TNS) we identify 164 transients that coincide with the data release. Although the Euclid Q1 release only includes single-epoch data, we are able to make Euclid photometric measurements at the location of 161 of these transients. Euclid obtained deep photometric measurements or upper limits of these transients in the $I\\_E$, $Y\\_E$, $J\\_E$, and $H\\_E$ bands at various phases of the transient light-curves, including before, during, and after the observations of ground-based transient surveys. Approximately 70\\% of known transients reported in the six months before the Euclid observation date and with discovery magnitude brighter than 24 were detected in Euclid $\\IE$ images. Our observations include one of the earliest near-infrared detections of a Type~Ia supernova (SN 2024pvw) 15 days prior to its peak brightness, and the late-phase (435.9 days post peak) observations of the enigmatic core-collapse SN 2023aew. Euclid deep photometry provides valuable information on the nature of these transients such as their progenitor systems and power sources, with late time observations being a uniquely powerful contribution. In addition, Euclid is able to detect the host galaxies of some transients that were previously classed as hostless. The Q1 data demonstrate the power of the Euclid data even with only single-epoch observations available, as will be the case for much larger areas of sky in the Euclid Wide Survey.\n\n", "2503.15067": "2025-03-19, **Exploring magnetised galactic outflows in starburst dwarf galaxies NGC 3125 and IC 4662**, Sam Taziaux et.al., [2503.15067v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15067v1)\n\n The study of radio emission in starburst dwarf galaxies provides a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the amplification and transport of magnetic fields. Local dwarfs are often considered proxies for early-Universe galaxies, so this study may provide insights into the role of non-thermal components in the formation and evolution of larger galaxies. By investigating the radio continuum spectra and maps of the starburst dwarf galaxies, we aim to draw conclusions on their magnetic field strengths and configurations, as well as the dynamics of cosmic ray (CR) transport. We perform a radio continuum polarimetry study of two of the brightest starburst IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS) dwarf galaxies, NGC 3125 and IC 4662. By combining data of the Australian Telescope Compact Array (2.1 GHz) and MeerKAT (1.28 GHz), we analyse the underlying emission mechanism and the CR transport in these systems. We find flat spectra in those dwarf galaxies over the entire investigated frequency range, which sharply contrasts with observations of massive spiral galaxies. Because the expected cooling time of CR electrons is much shorter than their escape time, we would expect a steepened steady-state CR electron spectrum. The flat observed spectra suggest a substantial contribution from free-free emission at high frequencies and absorption at low frequencies, which may solve this puzzle. For NGC 3125, we measure a degree of polarisation between 0.75% and 2.6%, implying a turbulent field and supporting the picture of a comparably large thermal emission component that could be sourced by stellar radiation feedback and supernovae.\n\n", "2503.14994": "2025-03-19, **V1047 Cen: The first Z And-type outburst observed in the classical nova binary**, Augustin Skopal et.al., [2503.14994v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14994v1)\n\n In 2019, the classical nova V1047 Cen experienced an unusual outburst, the nature of which has not yet been clearly determined. In this paper, we show that the 2019 V1047~Cen outburst is of Z And-type -- a type that is characteristic and has so far been observed only in symbiotic binaries. We support our claim by modeling the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectral energy distribution, which revealed a close similarity between the fundamental parameters and the mass-loss rate of the burning white dwarf during the 2019 V1047 Cen outburst and those measured during Z And-type outbursts in symbiotic stars. All parameters are in agreement with the theoretical prediction when the accretion rate exceeds the stable burning limit for white dwarfs with masses less than 0.7 solar units. Our analysis showed that after a nova explosion, the Z And-type outburst can occur not only in symbiotic binaries but also in short-period cataclysmic variables, when the accretion-powered system changes to a nuclear-powered one, as a consequence of the donor's reaction to the nova explosion. Such a development promotes the production of Type Ia supernovae.\n\n", "2503.14969": "2025-03-19, **Constraining Axially Symmetric Bianchi Type I Model with Self-Consistent Recombination History and Observables**, Boris Hoi-Lun Ng et.al., [2503.14969v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14969v1)\n\n Recent cosmological measurements suggest the possibility of an anisotropic universe. As a result, the Bianchi Type I model, being the simplest anisotropic extension to the standard Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric has been extensively studied. In this work, we show how the recombination history should be modified in an anisotropic universe and derive observables by considering the null geodesic. We then constrain the axially symmetric Bianchi Type I model by performing Markov Chain Monte Carlo with the acoustic scales in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, together with local measurements of $H(z)$ and Pantheon Supernova data. Our results reveal that the anisotropic model is not worth a bare mention compared to the $\\Lambda$CDM model, and we obtain a tight constraint on the anisotropy that generally agrees with previous studies under a maximum temperature anisotropy fraction of $2\\times 10^{-5}$. To allow for a non-kinematic CMB dipole, we also present constraints based on a relaxed maximum temperature anisotropy comparable to that of the CMB dipole. We stress that there is a significant difference between the geodesic-based observables and the naive isotropic analogies when there is a noticeable anisotropy. However, the changes in recombination history are insignificant even under the relaxed anisotropy limit.\n\n"}}
