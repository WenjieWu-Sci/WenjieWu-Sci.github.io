We especially focus on challenges at the interface to particle acceleration which can be inferred from the multi-messenger context, such as the paradigm that the sources power the Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). We demonstrate that both AGN blazars (in the context of neutrino observations) and GRBs (as UHECR sources in the context of neutrino-non-observations) point towards acceleration spectra harder than $E^{-2}$, or relatively high minimal cosmic-ray injection energies, to meet the respective energy budget requirements. We furthermore speculate that neutrino flares in AGN blazars may be related to super-Eddington accretion flares, or that GRBs are powered by significantly higher kinetic energies than typically assumed in electromagnetic models. For internal shock models, the UHECR paradigm for GRBs can only be maintained in the light of neutrino stacking limits in multi-zone models.

Additionally, the large data rate is increasingly difficult to analyze effectively, which has led to a recent revolution on machine learning techniques.

To demonstrate this, we encode the full neutrino telescope event information using parity observables in an IBM quantum processor using 8 qubits. Then we show that we can recover the information stored on the quantum computer with a fidelity of 84%. Finally, we illustrate the use of our protocol by performing a classification task that separates electron-neutrino events to muon-neutrinos events in a neutrino telescope.

They depend on the angular distribution of the neutrino's electron lepton number (ELN). In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the FFCs by solving the multienergy and multiangle quantum kinetic equations with an extended set of collisional weak processes based on a static and spherically symmetric CCSN matter background profile. We investigate the emergence and evolution of FFCs in models featuring different ELN angular distributions, considering scenarios with two and three neutrino flavors. The spectrogram method is utilized to illustrate the small-scale spatial structure, and we show that this structure of neutrino flavor coherence and number densities in the nonlinear regime is qualitatively consistent with the dispersion relation analysis. On the coarse-grained level, we find that different asymptotic states can be achieved following the FFCs depending on the locations and shapes of the ELN distributions, despite sharing a common feature of the elimination of the ELN angular crossing. While equilibration among different neutrino flavors may be achieved immediately after the prompt FFCs, it is not a general outcome of the asymptotic state, as subsequent feedback effects from collisional neutrino-matter interactions come into play, particularly for cases where FFCs occur inside the neutrinosphere. The impacts of FFCs and the feedback effect on the net neutrino heating rates, the equilibrium electron fraction of CCSN matter, and the free-streaming neutrino energy spectra are quantitatively assessed.

Consistency of the theory necessarily requires that the metric evolve stochastically. Here, we show that this stochastic behaviour leads to a modification of general relativity at low accelerations.   In the low acceleration regime, the variance in the acceleration produced by the gravitational field is high in comparison to that produced by the Newtonian potential, and acts as an entropic force, causing a deviation from Einstein's theory of general relativity. We show that in this \"diffusion regime\", the entropic force acts from a gravitational point of view, as if it were a contribution to the matter distribution.   We compute how this modifies the expectation value of the metric via the path integral formalism, and find that an entropic force driven by a stochastic cosmological constant can explain galactic rotation curves without needing to evoke dark matter. We caution that a greater understanding of this effect is needed before conclusions can be drawn, most likely through numerical simulations, and provide a template for computing the deviation from general relativity which serves as an experimental signature of the Brownian motion of spacetime.\n\n", "2402.19362": "2024-02-29, **Dark energy and dark matter configurations for wormholes and solitionic hierarchies of nonmetric Ricci flows and $F(R,T,Q,T_{m})$ gravity**, Lauren\u0163iu Bubuianu et.al., [2402.19362v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19362v1)\n\n We extend the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method, AFCDM, for constructing exact and parametric solutions in general relativity, GR, to geometric flow models and modified gravity theories, MGTs, with nontrivial torsion and nonmetricity fields.

Using nonholonomic frames with dyadic spacetime splitting and applying the AFCDM, we prove that such systems of PDEs can be decoupled and integrated in general forms for generic off-diagonal metric structures and generalized affine connections. We generate new classes of quasi-stationary solutions (which do not depend on time like coordinates) and study the physical properties of some physically important examples. Such exact or parametric solutions are determined by nonmetric solitonic distributions and/or ellipsoidal deformations of wormhole hole configurations. It is not possible to describe the thermodynamic properties of such solutions in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking paradigm because such metrics do not involve, in general, certain horizons, duality, or holographic configurations.

To investigate the impact of the pre-supernova environment of SN 1987A, we consider possible three cases of circumstellar medium (CSM) environments: only a steady wind; an eruptive mass loss; and the existence of a companion star. In sum, the resulting breakout light curve has an hour duration and its peak luminosity of $\\sim 6\\times 10^{46} \\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ following efficient post-breakout X-ray cooling of $\\sim 3.5$ mag hour$^{-1}$. The dominant band transits to UV after around 3 hours of shock breakout and its luminosity has a decay rate of $\\sim 1.5$ mag hour$^{-1}$ that agrees well with the observed shock breakout tail. The detailed features of breakout emission are sensitive to the pre-explosion environment. Our 2D simulations also demonstrate the importance of post-breakout mixing and its impacts on shock dynamics and radiation emission. The mixing driven by the shock breakout may lead to a global asymmetry of SN ejecta and affect its later supernova remnant formation.\n\n", "2402.18967": "2024-02-29, **Cosmological transition epoch from gamma-ray burst correlations**, Anna Chiara Alfano et.al., [2402.18967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18967v1)\n\n The redshift $z\\_t$ and the jerk parameter $j\\_t$ of the transition epoch are constrained by using two model-independent approaches involving the direct expansion of the Hubble rate and the expansion of the deceleration parameter around $z=z\\_t$. To extend our analysis to high-redshifts, we employ the \\emph{Amati}, \\emph{Combo}, \\emph{Yonetoku} and \\emph{Dainotti} gamma-ray burst correlations. The \\textit{circularity problem} is prevented by calibrating these correlations through the B\\'ezier interpolation of the updated observational Hubble data. Each gamma-ray burst data set is jointly fit with type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations through a Monte Carlo analysis, based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, to obtain $z\\_t$, $j\\_t$ and the correlation parameters. The overall results are compatible with the concordance model with some exceptions. We also focus on the behaviors of the dark energy, verifying its compatibility with a cosmological constant, and the matter density $\\Omega\\_m$ and compare them with the expectations of the concordance paradigm.\n\n"}}
