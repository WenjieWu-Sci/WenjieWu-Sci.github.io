Special attention is paid to millicharged dark matter, for which we constrain new parameter space by deriving the ceiling on sensitivity to its electric charge, arising from the nuclear-vs-electron recoil discriminants used in liquid argon and bubble chamber detectors. This result goes beyond ceilings previously identified in liquid xenon and semiconductor detectors from electron recoil vetoes.

Since the neutrino is at rest we use (in this first analysis) a non relativistic Gaussian wave function, and consider its spread. Due to the finite size of the packet, the time of the interaction of the muon will have an uncertainty. This uncertainty is small in the neutrino rest frame, but boosted to our frame, increases 18 orders of magnitude, making it extremely large. This effectively prevents the possibility of the observation of bursts, or the correlation with other events. A similar analysis for less energetic neutrinos show that the uncertainty is smaller than the duration of the observed bursts.\n\n", "2509.24011": "2025-09-28, **Resonance Contributions to Charged-Current (Anti)Neutrino-Nucleon Elastic Scattering at GeV Energies**, Oleksandr Tomalak et.al., [2509.24011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24011v1)\n\n We present the first evaluation of resonance contributions to the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies, focusing on the dominant $\\Delta(1232)$ resonance.

In this work, we investigate the thermal response for a set of extended Skyrme interactions that feature widely different density dependencies of the effective mass of the nucleons. Thermal contributions to the energy density and pressure are studied along with a few thermal coefficients over wide domains of density, temperature and isospin asymmetry, relevant for the physics of hot compact objects. For some of the effective interactions, the thermal pressure is negative at high densities. This results in a situation where hot compact stars can support less mass before collapsing into a black hole compared to their cold counterparts.

V. Lysenko et.al., [2509.24963v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24963v1)\n\n A massive vector field is a highly promising candidate for dark matter in the universe. A salient property of dark matter is its negligible or null coupling to ordinary matter, with the exception of gravitational interaction. This poses a significant challenge in producing the requisite amount of dark particles through processes within the Standard Model. In this study, we examine the production of a vector field during inflation due to its direct interaction with the inflaton field through kinetic and axion-like couplings as well as the field-dependent mass. The gradient-expansion formalism, previously proposed for massless Abelian gauge fields, is extended to include the longitudinal polarization of a massive vector field. We derive a coupled system of equations of motion for a set of bilinear functions of the vector field. This enables us to address the nonlinear dynamics of inflationary vector field production, including backreaction on background evolution. To illustrate this point, we apply our general formalism to a low-mass vector field whose kinetic and mass terms are coupled to the inflaton via the Ratra-type exponential function. The present study investigates the production of its transverse and longitudinal polarization components in a benchmark inflationary model with a quadratic inflaton potential. It has been demonstrated that pure mass coupling is able to enhance only the longitudinal components. By turning on also the kinetic coupling, one can get different scenarios. As the coupling function decreases, the primary contribution to the energy density is derived from the transverse polarizations of the vector field. Conversely, for an increasing coupling function, the longitudinal component becomes increasingly significant and rapidly propels the system into the strong backreaction regime.\n\n", "2509.24833": "2025-09-29, **Black Hole Solution in Anti-de Sitter Space with a New Cloud of Strings Surrounded by Dark Matter Halo**, Faizuddin Ahmed et.al., [2509.24833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24833v1)\n\n This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical study of a Schwarzschild-like Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) influenced by a new cloud of strings (NCS) and a dark matter halo (DMH) characterized by a Dehnen-type density profile.

Additionally, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of the BH in an extended phase space by deriving key quantities, such as the Hawking temperature, the equation of state (EoS), Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and the specific heat capacity. Our results show that the presence of NCS and DMH induces significant modifications in both the dynamical and thermodynamical behavior of the BH, including shifts in the Hawking-Page transition and divergences in heat capacity, thereby reshaping the phase structure of the BH.\n\n", "2509.24562": "2025-09-29, **Cosmological Scenarios in $f(Q,C)$ gravity with a dynamical degree of freedom**, Hamid Shabani et.al., [2509.24562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24562v1)\n\n The $f(Q,C)$ theory, which extends symmetric teleparallel gravity by including the boundary term $C$ in addition to the non-metricity scalar $Q$, provides a unifying framework that encompasses both $f(Q)$ and $f(\\mathring{R})$ gravities. In this work, we develop a comprehensive dynamical system analysis of $f(Q,C)$ cosmology formulated within the non-coincident affine connection branches.

We show that even for simple power-law forms of the Lagrangian, the theory accommodates a broad spectrum of cosmic scenarios, including successive pressureless matter eras, stiff-matter phases between early inflation and dark matter domination, and late-time acceleration. Our analysis demonstrates that the Universe can naturally evolve from an initial de Sitter phase to a matter-dominated epoch and subsequently to a final de Sitter attractor, consistent with the observed thermal history.

While many methods exist, most require assumptions about the form of the underlying distribution function or data binning that leads to loss of information. With only line-of-sight (LOS) data, many methods suffer from the well-known mass-anisotropy degeneracy. To overcome these limitations, we develop a new, publicly available mass-modeling method, GravSphere2. This combines individual stellar velocities from LOS and proper motion (PM) measurements to solve the Jeans equations up to fourth order, without any data binning. Using flexible functional forms for the anisotropy profiles at second and fourth order, we show how including additional constraints from a new observable - fourth-order PMs - fully closes the system of equations, breaking the mass-anisotropy degeneracy at all orders. We test our method on mock data for dwarf galaxies, showing how GravSphere2 improves on previous methods. GravSphere2 recovers the mass density, stellar velocity anisotropy, and logarithmic slope of the mass density profile within its quoted 95% confidence intervals across almost all mocks over a wide radial range (0.1 < R/Rhalf < 10). We find GravSphere2 outperforms simple mass estimators, suggesting that it is worth using even when only a few LOS velocities are available. With 1,000 tracers without PMs, GravSphere2 recovers the logarithmic density slope at Rhalf with 12% (25%) statistical errors for cuspy (cored) mock data, enabling a distinction between the two. Including PMs, this improves to 8% (12%). With just 100 tracers and no PMs, we recover slopes with ~ 30% (20%) errors.

We confirm that dark matter halos start out predominantly prolate (elongated) and their shapes are aligned with their nearest filaments; prolate galaxies retain strong shape-alignment with their outer halos to later times. The fraction of prolate galaxies and halos increases toward lower stellar mass, higher redshift, and lower-density filaments. Oblate and spheroidal galaxies show weaker trends with filament density, but spheroidal halos preferentially reside in higher-density filaments. We also find that higher-density filaments favor extended rotationally-supported disks, whereas lower-density filaments more often host smaller dispersion-supported systems. Then, generating mock galaxy samples from TNG100 and TNG50, we predict the early cosmic web accessible to Roman.

We investigate how realistic 3D radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) model atmospheres affect carbon abundances in CEMP stars and implications for their classification and Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We focus on biases from traditional 1D hydrostatic models. We use the M3DIS code to compute 3D RHD model atmospheres for main-sequence and sub-giant stars over a wide range of metallicities and carbon enhancements. Synthetic spectra of the CH G-band are calculated with 3D radiative transfer and compared to spectra from classical 1D MARCS models. We derive abundance corrections and apply them to a large SAGA database sample to quantify effects on the carbon abundance distribution and CEMP classification. Our new 3D CEMP models predict cooler upper atmospheric layers than in 1D models, resulting in stronger CH absorption and lower inferred carbon abundances by up to -0.9 dex at the lowest metallicities. Carbon enhancement in the atmosphere itself increases molecular opacities and leads to radiative re-heating, partly offsetting adiabatic cooling in 3D models and reducing 3D-1D abundance corrections. Applying these corrections lowers the CEMP fraction by up to 20% below [Fe/H]=-3 and alters the relative contribution of CEMP sub-classes. The fraction of CEMP-no stars increases while the number of CEMP-r/s stars decreases, due to the downward revision of absolute carbon abundances.
