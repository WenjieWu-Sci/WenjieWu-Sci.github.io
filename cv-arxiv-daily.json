This measurement utilizes data from 6.4$\\times10^{20}$ protons on target of exposure collected using the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber located along the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam with a mean neutrino energy of approximately 0.8~GeV. The mapping from reconstructed kinematics to truth quantities, particularly from reconstructed to true neutrino energy, is validated by comparing the distribution of reconstructed hadronic energy in data to that of the model prediction in different muon scattering angle bins after conditional constraint from the muon momentum distribution in data. The success of this validation gives confidence that the missing energy in the MicroBooNE detector is well-modeled in simulation, enabling the unfolding to a triple-differential measurement over muon momentum, muon scattering angle, and neutrino energy. The unfolded measurement covers an extensive phase space, providing a wealth of information useful for future liquid argon time projection chamber experiments measuring neutrino oscillations.

Also, the origins of the cosmic high-energy neutrino and MeV gamma-ray backgrounds have been veiled in mystery since their discoveries. We propose emission from stellar-mass BHs (sBHs) embedded in disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) as their possible sources. These sBHs are predicted to launch jets due to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, which can produce intense electromagnetic, neutrino, and cosmic-ray emissions. We investigate whether these emissions can be the sources of cosmic high-energy particles. We find that emission from internal shocks in the jets can explain gamma rays from nearby radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies including NGC1068, if the Lorentz factor of the jets ($\\Gamma\\_{\\rm j}$) is high. On the other hand, for moderate $\\Gamma\\_{\\rm j}$, the emission can significantly contribute to the background gamma-ray and neutrino intensities in the $\\sim {\\rm MeV}$ and $\\lesssim {\\rm PeV}$ bands, respectively. Furthermore, for moderate $\\Gamma\\_{\\rm j}$ with efficient amplification of the magnetic field and cosmic-ray acceleration, the neutrino emission from NGC1068 and the ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays can be explained. These results suggest that the neutrino flux from NGC1068 as well as the background intensities of ${\\rm MeV}$ gamma rays, neutrinos, and the ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays can be explained by a unified model.

Decoherence damps the oscillation pattern, making it harder to resolve experimentally. Additionally, it enhances lepton number violation (LNV) for processes in symmetry-protected low-scale seesaw models by reducing the destructive interference between mass eigenstates. We discuss a novel time-independent shift in the phase and derive formulae for calculating decoherence effects and the phase shift in the relevant regimes, which are the no dispersion regime and transverse dispersion regime. We find that the phase shift can be neglected in the parameter region under consideration since it is small apart from parameter regions with large damping. In the oscillation formulae, decoherence can be included by an effective damping parameter. We discuss this parameter and present averaged results, which apply to simulations of NNOs in the dilepton-dijet channel at the HL-LHC. We show that including decoherence effects can dramatically change the theoretical prediction for the ratio of LNV over LNC events.\n\n", "2307.06192": "2023-07-12, **Failed supernova simulations beyond black hole formation**, Takami Kuroda et.al., [2307.06192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06192v1)\n\n We present an axisymmetric failed supernova simulation beyond black hole formation, for the first time with numerical relativity and two-moment multi energy neutrino transport.

We demonstrate that our excision method is capable to stably evolve the radiation-hydrodynamics in dynamical black hole spacetime.

Motivated by previous works on a possible Dark Matter (DM) explanation for the TeV cut-off observed in the innermost $\\sim 16$ pc of the Galaxy, we aim to constrain the DM density profile up to a radius $\\sim 450$ pc from the GC. In this region, cosmological simulations and Galactic dynamics studies fail to produce a strong prediction of the DM profile. With our proof-of-concept analysis, we set upper limits on the density distribution of thermal multi-TeV WIMPs, compatible with the observed gamma-ray flux. The results agree with the hypothesis of a DM density enhancement in the GC with respect to the benchmark NFW profile ($\\gamma=1$) and allow us to exclude profiles with a slope $\\gamma \\gtrsim 1.3$. We also investigate the possibility that such an enhancement could be related to the existence of a DM spike associated with the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. We find out that the existence of an adiabatic DM spike smoothed by the scattering off of WIMPs by the bulge stars may be consistent with the observed gamma-ray flux if the spike forms on an underlying generalized NFW profile with $\\gamma \\lesssim 0.8$, corresponding to a spike slope $\\gamma\\_{sp-star}= 1.5$ and radius $R\\_\\text{sp-stars} \\sim 25$-$30$ pc.

Cold DM cosmological simulations predict steep inner slopes, gammaDM>~1. We test this prediction on the MACS J1206.2-0847 cluster at redshift z=0.44, whose DM density profile was claimed to be cored at the center. We determine the cluster DM density profile from 2 kpc from the cluster center to the virial radius (~2 Mpc), using the velocity distribution of ~500 cluster galaxies and the velocity dispersion profile of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG), obtained from VIMOS@VLT and MUSE@VLT data. We solve the Jeans equation of dynamical equilibrium using an upgraded version of the MAMPOSSt method. The total mass profile is modeled as a sum of a generalized-NFW profile that describes the DM component, allowing for a free inner slope of the density profile, a Jaffe profile that describes the BCG stellar mass component, and a non-parametric baryonic profile that describes the sum of the remaining galaxy stellar mass and of the hot intra-cluster gas mass.

The model under consideration contains a B-L gauge symmetry and a vector-like fermion which acts as the dark matter candidate. The fermion induces significant a large dark matter-nucleon scattering rate, and the Z' field produces clear dilepton events at colliders. Thus, direct detection experiments and colliders severely constrain the parameter space in which the correct relic density is found in agreement with the data. Nevertheless, little is known about the new scalar responsible for breaking the B-L symmetry. If this breaking occurs via a first-order phase transition at a TeV scale, it could lead to gravitational waves in the mHz frequency range detectable by LISA, DECIGO, and BBO instruments.

Here, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the bending instability in realistic models of disc galaxies in which an exponential stellar disc is under vertical equilibrium and residing in a cold rigid dark matter halo. A quadratic eigenvalue equation describing the bending modes is formulated and solved for the complete eigen spectrum for a set of model disc galaxies by varying their physical properties such as disc scale-height, and dark matter halo mass. It is shown that the vertical pressure gradient force can excite unstable bending modes in such a disc as well as large scale discrete modes. Further, it is shown that the unstable eigen-modes in a thinner disc grow faster than those in a thicker disc.

The most widely adopted approach, based on the N-body discretization of the collisionless Vlasov-Poisson (VP) equations, is hampered by an unfavourable scaling when simulating the wide range of scales needed to cover at the same time the formation of single galaxies and of the largest cosmic structures. On the other hand, the dynamics described by the VP equations is limited by the rapid increase of the number of resolution elements (grid points and/or particles) which is required to simulate an ever growing range of scales. Recent studies showed an interesting mapping of the 6-dimensional+1 (6D+1) VP problem into a more amenable 3D+1 non-linear Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson (SP) problem for simulating the evolution of DM perturbations. This opens up the possibility of improving the scaling of time propagation simulations using quantum computing.

Narrower emission lines (100-170~km~s$^{-1}$ FWHM) are seen from species originating from a more extended lower-density component whose high ionization may have been produced by shocks progressing through the ER, or by the UV radiation pulse associated with the original supernova event. The asymmetric east-west dust emission in the ER has continued to fade, with constant temperature, signifying a reduction in dust mass. Small grains in the ER are preferentially destroyed, with larger grains from the progenitor surviving the transition from SN into SNR.

Specifically, our fit suggests $v\\_\\mathrm{pec}^{z=0}\\propto M\\_\\mathrm{tot}^{-0.5}$ and $v\\_\\mathrm{pec}^{z=0}\\propto P\\_\\mathrm{orb}^{-0.2}$. Discussions are presented on possible interpretation of the correlations in the context of kinematics and possible biases. The sample should enable a range of follow-up studies on compact object binary kinematics and evolution.\n\n", "2307.06405": "2023-07-12, **Non-Stationary Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background: A New Probe to the High Redshift Population of Binary Black Holes**, Mohit Raj Sah et.al., [2307.06405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06405v1)\n\n The astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) originates from the mergers of compact binary objects in the observable Universe that are otherwise undetected as individual events, along with other sources such as supernovae, magnetars etc. The individual GW signal is time-varying over a time scale that depends on the chirp mass of the coalescing binaries. Another timescale that plays a role is the timescale at which the sources repeat, which depends on the merger rate. The combined effect of these two leads to a breakdown of the time-translation symmetry of the observed SGWB and leads to a correlation between different frequency modes in the signal covariance matrix of the SGWB. Using an ensemble of SGWB sky map due to binary black hole (BBH) coalescence, calculated using simulations of different astrophysical and primordial black hole mass distribution and merger rates, we show how the structure of the signal covariance matrix varies. This structure in the signal covariance matrix brings additional information about the sources on top of the power spectrum of the SGWB. We show that there is up to a factor of 2.5 improvement in the Figure of Merit (FoM) by using this additional information in comparison to only power spectrum estimation for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network of detectors with the design sensitivity noise with two years of observation time. The inclusion of the off-diagonal correlation in the covariance of the SGWB in the data analysis pipelines will be beneficial in the quest for the SGWB signal in LVK frequency bands as well as in lower frequencies (nano-Hz, mili-Hz, deci-Hz) and in getting an insight into the origin of the SGWB signal.\n\n", "2307.06368": "2023-07-12, **Metallicity beats sSFR: The connection between superluminous supernova host galaxy environments and the importance of metallicity for their production**, Cressida Cleland et.al., [2307.06368v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06368v1)\n\n We analyse 33 Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) taken from ZTF's Bright Transient Survey to investigate the local environments of their host galaxies. We use a spectroscopic sample of galaxies from the SDSS to determine the large-scale environmental density of the host galaxy. Noting that SLSNe are generally found in galaxies with low stellar masses, high star formation rates, and low metallicities, we find that SLSN hosts are also rarely found within high-density environments. Only $3\\substack{+9 \\\\-1}$ per cent of SLSN hosts were found in regions with 2 or more bright galaxies within 2 Mpc. For comparison, we generate a sample of 662 SDSS galaxies matched to the photometric properties of the SLSN hosts. This sample is also rarely found within high-density environments, suggesting that galaxies with properties required for SLSN production favour more isolated environments. Furthermore, we select galaxies within the Illustris-TNG simulation to match SLSN host galaxy properties in colour and stellar mass. We find that the fraction of simulated galaxies in high-density environments quantitatively matches the observed SLSN hosts only if we restrict to simulated galaxies with metallicity $12+\\log($O/H$) \\leq 8.12$. In contrast, limiting to only the highest sSFR galaxies in the sample leads to an overabundance of SLSN hosts in high-density environments. Thus, our measurement of the environmental density of SLSN host galaxies appears to break the degeneracy between low-metallicity or high-sSFR as the driver for SLSN hosts and provides evidence that the most constraining factor on SLSN production is low-metallicity.\n\n", "2307.06308": "2023-07-12, **The Spatial and Emission Properties of the Large [O III] Emission Nebula Near M31**, Robert A. Fesen et.al., [2307.06308v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06308v1)\n\n Drechsler et al. (2023) reported the unexpected discovery of a 1.5 degree long [O III] emission nebula 1.2 degrees southeast of the M31 nucleus. Here we present additional images of this large emission structure, called SDSO, along with radial velocity and flux measurements from low-dispersion spectra. Independent sets of [O III] images show SDSO to be composed of broad streaks of diffuse emission aligned NE-SW. Deep H$\\alpha$ images reveal no strong coincident emission suggesting a high [O III]/H$\\alpha$ ratio. We also find no other [O III] emission nebulosity as bright as SDSO within several degrees of M31 and no filamentary H$\\alpha$ emission connected to SDSO. Optical spectra taken along the arc's northern limb reveal [O III] $\\lambda\\lambda$4959,5007 emissions matching the location and extent seen in our [O III] images. The heliocentric velocity of this [O III] nebulosity is $-9.8 \\pm 6.8$ km s$^{-1}$ with a peak surface brightness of $(4\\pm2) \\times 10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ ($\\sim$0.55 Rayleigh). We discuss SDSO as a possible unrecognized supernova remnant, a large and unusually nearby planetary nebula, a stellar bow shock nebula, or an interaction of M31's outer halo gas with high-velocity circumgalactic gas. We conclude that galactic origins for SDSO are unlikely and favor instead an extragalactic M31 halo--circumgalactic cloud interaction scenario, despite the nebula's low radial velocity. We then describe new observations that may help resolve the true nature and origin of this large nebulosity so close to M31 in the sky.\n\n", "2307.05907": "2023-07-12, **An Alternative Formation Scenario for Uranium-rich Giants: Engulfing a Earth-like Planet**, Dian Xie et.al., [2307.05907v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05907v1)\n\n The actinides, such as the uranium (U) element, are typically synthesized through the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), which can occur in core-collapse supernovae or double neutron star mergers. There exist nine r-process giant stars exhibiting conspicuousUabundances, commonly referred to as U-rich giants. However, the origins of these U-rich giants remain ambiguous. We propose an alternative formation scenario for these U-rich giants whereby a red giant (RG) engulfs an Earth-like planet. To approximate the process of a RG engulfing an Earth-like planet, we employ an accretion model wherein the RG assimilates materials from said planet. Our findings demonstrate that this engulfment event can considerably enhance the presence of heavy elements originating from Earth-like planets on the surfaces of very metal-poor stars (Z = 0.00001), while its impact on solar-metallicity stars is comparatively modest. Importantly, the structural and evolutionary properties of both very metalpoor and solar-metallicity stars remain largely unaffected. Notably, our engulfment model effectively accounts for the observed U abundances in known U-rich giants. Furthermore, the evolutionary trajectories of U abundances on the surfaces of RGs subsequent to the engulfment of Earth-like planets encompass all known U-rich giants. Therefore, it is plausible that U-rich giants are formed when a RG engulfs an Earth-like planet.\n\n"}}
