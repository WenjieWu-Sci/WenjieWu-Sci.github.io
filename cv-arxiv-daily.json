The early and prompt detection of neutrinos before (pre-SN) and during the SN burst is a unique opportunity to realize the multi-messenger observation of the CCSN events. In this work, we describe the monitoring concept and present the sensitivity of the system to the pre-SN and SN neutrinos at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), which is a 20 kton liquid scintillator detector under construction in South China. The real-time monitoring system is designed with both the prompt monitors on the electronic board and online monitors at the data acquisition stage, in order to ensure both the alert speed and alert coverage of progenitor stars. By assuming a false alert rate of 1 per year, this monitoring system can be sensitive to the pre-SN neutrinos up to the distance of about 1.6 (0.9) kpc and SN neutrinos up to about 370 (360) kpc for a progenitor mass of 30$M\\_{\\odot}$ for the case of normal (inverted) mass ordering. The pointing ability of the CCSN is evaluated by using the accumulated event anisotropy of the inverse beta decay interactions from pre-SN or SN neutrinos, which, along with the early alert, can play important roles for the followup multi-messenger observations of the next Galactic or nearby extragalactic CCSN.\n\n", "2309.06920": "2023-09-13, **Anomaly-free dark matter models with one-loop neutrino masses and a gauged U(1) symmetry**, T. de Boer et.al., [2309.06920v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06920v1)\n\n We systematically study and classify scotogenic models with a local U(1) gauge symmetry. These models give rise to radiative neutrino masses and a stable dark matter candidate, but avoid the theoretical problems of global and discrete symmetries. We restrict the dark sector particle content to up to four scalar or fermionic SU(2) singlets, doublets or triplets and use theoretical arguments based on anomaly freedom, Lorentz and gauge symmetry to find all possible charge assignments of these particles. The U(1) symmetry can be broken by a new Higgs boson to a residual discrete symmetry, that still stabilizes the dark matter candidate. We list the particle content and charge assignments of all non-equivalent models. Specific examples in our class of models that have been studied previously in the literature are the U(1)$\\_D$ scotogenic and singlet-triplet scalar models breaking to $Z\\_2$.

A program based on this new method is found to be roughly twice as fast as, and in agreement with, the leading GLoBES package. Furthermore, the behaviour of all relevant effective parameters is sketched out in terms of a range of neutrino energies, or matter electron densities.

To date, ANTARES searches for these objects considered GeV-TeV $\\gamma$-ray bright blazars. Here, a statistically complete radio-bright blazar sample is used as the target for searches of origins of neutrinos collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope over 13 years of operation. The hypothesis of a neutrino-blazar directional correlation is tested by pair counting and by a complementary likelihood-based approach. The resulting post-trial $p$-value is $3.0\\%$ ($2.2\\sigma$ in the two-sided convention), possibly indicating a correlation. Additionally, a time-dependent analysis is performed to search for temporal clustering of neutrino candidates as a mean of detecting neutrino flares in blazars.

As found in the case of Majorana neutrinos, the SFP of Dirac neutrinos is enhanced by the large magnetic field potential and suppressed by large matter potentials composed of the baryon density and the electron fraction. The SFP is possible irrespective of the large baryon density when the electron fraction is close to 1/3. The diagonal neutrino magnetic moments that are prohibited for Majorana neutrinos enable the spin precession of Dirac neutrinos without any flavor mixing. With supernova hydrodynamics simulation data, we discuss the possibility of the SFP of both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos in core-collapse supernovae. The SFP of Dirac neutrinos occurs at a radius where the electron fraction is 1/3. The required magnetic field of the proto-neutron star for the SFP is a few $10^{14}$G at any explosion time. For the Majorana neutrinos, the required magnetic field fluctuates from $10^{13}$G to $10^{15}$G. Such a fluctuation of the magnetic field is more sensitive to the numerical scheme of the neutrino transport in the supernova simulation.\n\n", "2309.06492": "2023-09-12, **Discovering Long-lived Particles at DUNE**, Pilar Coloma et.al., [2309.06492v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06492v1)\n\n Long-lived particles (LLPs) arise in many theories beyond the Standard Model. These may be copiously produced from meson decays (or through their mixing with the LLP) at neutrino facilities and leave a visible decay signal in nearby neutrino detectors. We compute the expected sensitivity of the DUNE liquid argon (LAr) and gaseous argon (GAr) near detectors (ND) to light LLP decays. In doing so, we determine the expected backgrounds for both detectors, which have been largely overlooked in the literature, taking into account their angular and energy resolution. We show that searches for LLP decays into muon pairs, or into three pions, would be extremely clean. Conversely, decays into two photons would be affected by large backgrounds from neutrino interactions for both near detectors; finally, the reduced signal efficiency for $e^+ e^-$ pairs leads to a reduced sensitivity for ND-LAr. Our results are first presented in a model-independent way, as a function of the mass of the new state and its lifetime. We also provide detailed calculations for several phenomenological models with axion-like particles (coupled to gluons, to electroweak bosons, or to quark currents).

This quantity is being measured with increasing precision, and planned experiments would seemingly rule out light particles beyond the Standard Model, even for rather high temperature light particle freeze out. Here we explore how these bounds are loosened if the energy density of the light particles is diluted with respect to that of Standard Model radiation, which can happen if a heavy particle decays into the Standard Model bath after the light particle freezes out. After calculating how heavy state decays alter $N\\_{eff}$ for light particles beyond the Standard Model, we focus in particular on the case that the heavy decaying particle is a gravitino, and use current bounds on $N\\_{eff}$ to place constraints on the gravitino mass and the branching ratio into light particles for different values of the reheating temperature of the Universe.\n\n", "2309.06477": "2023-09-12, **Constraining Cosmology With the CMB $\\times$ LIM-Nulling Convergence**, Hannah Fronenberg et.al., [2309.06477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06477v1)\n\n Lensing reconstruction maps from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide direct observations of the matter distribution of the universe without the use of a biased tracer. Such maps, however, constitute projected observables along the line of sight that are dominated by their low-redshift contributions. To cleanly access high-redshift information, Maniyar et al. showed that a linear combination of lensing maps from both CMB and line intensity mapping (LIM) observations can exactly null the low-redshift contribution to CMB lensing convergence. In this paper we explore the scientific returns of this nulling technique. We show that LIM-nulling estimators can place constraints on standard $\\Lambda$CDM plus neutrino mass parameters that are competitive with traditional CMB lensing. Additionally, we demonstrate that as a clean probe of the high-redshift universe, LIM-nulling can be used for model-independent tests of cosmology beyond $\\Lambda$CDM and as a probe of the high-redshift matter power spectrum.\n\n", "2309.06473": "2023-09-12, **Axion paradigm with color-mediated neutrino masses**, A.

The discussion is established in the framework of the $\\mu\\nu$SSM, where the presence of $R$-parity violating couplings involving right-handed neutrinos solves simultaneously the $\\mu$-problem and the accommodation of neutrino masses and mixing angles. The sbottoms are pair produced at the LHC, decaying to a lepton and a top quark or a neutrino and a bottom quark. The decays can be prompt or displaced, depending on the regions of the parameter space of the model. We focus the analysis on the right sbottom LSP, since the left sbottom is typically heavier than the left stop because of the D-term contribution. We compare the predictions of this scenario with ATLAS and CMS searches for prompt and long-lived particles. To analyze the parameter space we sample the $\\mu\\nu$SSM for a right sbottom LSP, paying special attention to reproduce the current experimental data on neutrino and Higgs physics, as well as flavor observables. For displaced (prompt) decays, our results translate into lower limits on the mass of the right sbottom LSP of about $1041$ GeV ($1070$ GeV).

The radon concentration is the main hall is required to be around 100 Bq/m$^3$. Optimization of the ventilation with fresh air is effective to control the radon underground. To find the radon sources in the underground laboratory, we made a benchmark experiment in the refuge room near the main hall.

However, how to search and extract the GW signals from core-collapse supernovae remains an open question due to its complicated time-frequency structure. In this paper, we applied the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method to decompose and reconstruct simulated GW data generated by magnetorotational mechanism and neutrino-driven mechanism within the advanced LIGO, using the match score as the criterion for assessing the quality of the reconstruction. The results indicate that by decomposing the data, the sum of the first six intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) can be used as the reconstructed waveform. To determine the probability that our reconstructed waveform corresponds to a real GW waveform, we calculated the false alarm probability of reconstruction (FAPR). By setting the threshold of the match score to be 0.75, we obtained FAPR of GW sources at a distance of 5 kpc and 10 kpc to be $1\\times10^{-2}$ and $3\\times10^{-2}$ respectively. If we normalize the maximum amplitude of the GW signal to $5\\times10^{-21}$, the FAPR at this threshold is $4\\times10^{-3}$.

Although being physically related, these two components are often described with different physical models. Here, we present a unified technique to derive the ICM properties from strong lensing for clusters in hydrostatic equilibrium. In order to derive this model, we present a new universal and self-similar polytropic temperature profile, which we fit using the X-COP sample of clusters. We subsequently derive an analytical model for the electron density, which we apply to strong lensing clusters MACS J0242.5-2132 and MACS J0949.8+1708. We confront the inferred ICM reconstructions to XMM-Newton and ACT observations. We contrast our analytical electron density reconstructions with the best canonical $\\beta$-model. The ICM reconstructions obtained prove to be compatible with observations. However they appear to be very sensitive to various dark matter halo parameters constrained through strong lensing (such as the core radius), and to the halo scale radius (fixed in the lensing optimisations). With respect to the important baryonic effects, we make the sensitivity on the scale radius of the reconstruction an asset, and use the inferred potential to constrain the dark matter density profile using ICM observations.

We concentrated on the mechanism where DMs are universally produced only from the PBH decay and the generation of the standard model plasma from both inflton and PBHs. Whereas the distribution of Primordial Black Holes behaves like dust, the inflaton phenomenology depends strongly on its equation of state after the inflationary phase, which in turn is conditioned by the nature of the potential $V(\\phi)$. Depending upon the initial mass and population of PBHs, a large range of DM mass is shown to be viable if reheating is controlled by PBHs itself.

In this paper, we revisit previous estimates of the impact of dark-matter accretion by black-hole secondaries on the emitted gravitational waves. We identify a region of parameter space of binaries for which estimates of the accretion were too large (specifically, because the dark-matter distribution was assumed to be unchanging throughout the process, and the secondary black hole accreted more mass in dark matter than that enclosed within the orbit of the secondary). To restore consistency in these scenarios, we propose and implement a method to remove dark-matter particles from the distribution function when they are accreted by the secondary. This new feedback procedure then satisfies mass conservation, and when evolved with physically reasonable initial data, the mass accreted by the secondary no longer exceeds the mass enclosed within its orbital radius. Comparing the simulations with accretion feedback to those without this feedback, including feedback leads to a smaller gravitational-wave dephasing from binaries in which only the effects of dynamical friction are being modeled. Nevertheless, the dephasing can be hundreds to almost a thousand gravitational-wave cycles, an amount that should allow the effects of accretion to be inferred from gravitational-wave measurements of these systems.\n\n", "2309.06479": "2023-09-12, **The contribution of massive haloes to the matter power spectrum in the presence of AGN feedback**, M.

Many past techniques have been limited by assumptions such as the Galaxy being in dynamical equilibrium as well as nearby galaxies being true satellites of the Galaxy, and/or the need to find large samples of Milky Way analogs in simulations.Here, we propose a new technique based on neural networks that obtains high precision ($<0.14$ dex mass uncertainty) without assuming halo dynamical equilibrium or that neighboring galaxies are all satellites, and which can use information from a wide variety of simulated halos (even those dissimilar to the Milky Way) to improve its performance. This method uses only observable information including satellite orbits, distances to nearby larger halos, and the maximum circular velocity of the largest satellite galaxy. In this paper, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept method on simulated dark matter halos; in future papers in this series, we will apply neural networks to estimate the masses of the Milky Way's and M31's dark matter halos, and we will train variations of these networks to estimate other halo properties including concentration, assembly history, and spin axis.\n\n", "2309.06466": "2023-09-12, **The integrated galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function over the radial acceleration range of early-type galaxies**, J\u00f6rg Dabringhausen et.al., [2309.06466v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06466v1)\n\n The observed radial accelerations of 462 Early-type galaxies (ETGs) at their half-mass radii are discussed. They are compared to the baryonic masses of the same galaxies, which are derived from theoretical expectations for their stellar populations and cover a range from $\\approx 10^4 \\, {\\rm M}\\_{\\odot}$ to $\\approx 10^{11} \\, {\\rm M}\\_{\\odot}$. Both quantities are plotted against each other, and it is tested whether they lie (within errors) along theoretical radial acceleration relations (RARs). We choose the Newtonian RAR and two Milgromian, or MONDian RARs. At low radial accelerations (corresponding to low masses), the Newtonian RAR fails without non-baryonic dark matter, but the two MONDian ones may work, provided moderate out-of-equilibrium dynamics in some of the low-mass ETGs. However all three RARs fail at high accelerations (corresponding to high masses) if all ETGs have formed their stellar populations with the canonical stellar initial mass function (IMF). A much better agreement with the observations can however be accomplished, if the theory of the integrated galaxy-wide stellar initial mass functions (IGIMFs) is used instead. This is because the IGIMF-theory predicts the formation of an overabundance of stellar remnants during the lifetime of the massive ETGs. Thus their baryonic masses today are higher than they would be if the ETGs had formed with a canonical IMF. Also the masses of the stellar-mass black holes should be rather high, which would mean that most of them probably formed when the massive ETGs were not as metal-enriched as they are today. The IGIMF-approach confirms downsizing.\n\n", "2309.06232": "2023-09-12, **Dynamical system analysis of cosmological evolution in the Aether scalar tensor theory**, Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Rosa et.al., [2309.06232v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06232v1)\n\n The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of General Relativity (GR), proposed for addressing galactic and cosmological observations without dark matter.The action for the theory includes a function that can currently only be constrained by phenomenological considerations. In antecedent work, forms of this function were considered that led to an effective fluid contribution to the cosmological evolution equations that approximated that of dust more and more closely at late cosmic times. In this work we consider an alternative set of functions that most closely approximate dust at the earliest cosmic times and where deviations from dust-like behaviour gradually emerge with time. We use the dynamical system formalism to analyze example models from both possible sets of functions, introducing a complete set of dynamical variables describing the spacetime curvature, energy density parameters of different matter components, and AeST scalar field, and obtain the dynamical equations describing cosmological evolution. The cosmological phase space is found to feature invariant submanifolds associated to the absence of the matter components, as well as equilibrium states associated with well-known cosmological behaviors e.g. matter, radiation, and cosmological constant dominated epochs. A full numerical integration of the dynamical system is performed for the models and it is shown that each can closely approximate the $\\Lambda \\mathrm{CDM}$ model at the level of the cosmic background. Generalizations of the models are considered and it is shown that the new models likely can simultaneously replicate the cosmological successes of cold dark matter whilst satisfying constraints on the theory from the weak-field quasistatic regime.\n\n", "2309.06151": "2023-09-12, **Constraints on the annihilation of heavy dark matter in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with gamma-ray observations**, Xiao-Song Hu et.al., [2309.06151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06151v1)\n\n Electrons and positrons produced in dark matter annihilation can generate secondary emission through synchrotron and IC processes, and such secondary emission provides a possible means to detect DM particles with masses beyond the detector's energy band. The secondary emission of heavy dark matter (HDM) particles in the TeV-PeV mass range lies within the Fermi-LAT energy band. In this paper, we utilize the Fermi-LAT observations of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies to search for annihilation signals of HDM particles. We consider the propagation of $e^+/e^-$ produced by DM annihilation within the dSphs, derive the electron spectrum of the equilibrium state by solving the propagation equation, and then compute the gamma-ray signals produced by the $e^+/e^-$ population through the IC and synchrotron processes. We do not detect any significant HDM signal. By assuming a magnetic field strength of $B=1\\,{\\rm \\mu G}$ and a diffusion coefficient of $D\\_0 = 3\\times10^{28}\\,{\\rm cm^{2}s^{-1}}$ of the dSphs, we place limits on the annihilation cross section for HDM particles.

As a complement, we also search for the prompt $\\gamma$-rays produced by DM annihilation and give limits on the cross section in the 10-$10^5$ GeV mass range. Consequently, in this paper we obtain the upper limits on the DM annihilation cross section for a very wide mass range from 10 GeV to 100 PeV in a unified framework of the Fermi-LAT data analysis.\n\n", "2309.06093": "2023-09-12, **Bulk viscous late acceleration under near equilibrium conditions in f(R, T) gravity with mixed matter**, Vishnu A Pai et.al., [2309.06093v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06093v1)\n\n Various studies have shown that the late acceleration of the universe can be caused by the bulk viscosity associated with dark matter.

The first data release includes data from the 2022A semester. We systematically observed three samples: a flux-limited sample that includes all transients $<$17 mag in a red optical band (usually ZTF r or ATLAS o bands); a volume-limited sample including all transients within redshift $z < 0.01$ ($D \\approx 50$ Mpc); and an SN Ia sample targeting objects at phases and light-curve parameters that had scant existing NIR data in the literature.

All completeness numbers will rise with the inclusion of data from other telescopes in future data releases.

When the ram pressure is moderate, we find that the stripping satellite shows an enhanced SFR relative to the isolated control case, despite gas loss due to stripping. The SFR enhancement is caused, not directly by compression, but by ram pressure-driven mass flows, which can increase the dense gas fraction in the central disk regions. The spatially-resolved star formation main sequence and Kennicutt-Schmidt relations in our simulations are consistent with recent findings of the VERTICO and GASP surveys. Our results predict the environmental signals of RPS in future multiwavelength, high-angular resolution observations: the star formation and gas surface densities will be centralized, and symmetrically enhanced within the stripping radius.\n\n", "2309.06855": "2023-09-13, **Discovery of a molecular cloud possibly associated with the youngest Galactic SNR G1.9+0.3**, Rei Enokiya et.al., [2309.06855v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06855v1)\n\n The youngest known Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G1.9+0.3 has high-velocity supernova shock beyond 10000 km s-1, and it is considered to be one of the major candidates of a PeVatron. Despite these outstanding properties, the surrounding interstellar matter of this object is poorly understood. We investigated the interstellar gas toward G1.9+0.3 using the 12CO(J=3-2) data with the angular resolution of 15\" obtained by the CHIMPS2 survey by the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and discovered three individual clouds at -1, 7, and 45 km s-1. From its morphological and velocity structures, the -1 km s-1 cloud, having the largest velocity width >20 km s-1 and located at the distance of the Galactic Center, is possibly associated with the SNR. The associated cloud shows a cavity structure both in space and velocity and coincides well with the SNR. We found that the associated cloud has higher column densities toward three bright, radio synchrotron-emitted rims where the radial expansion velocity of the supernova shock is decelerated, and the cloud is faint in the other parts of the SNR.

We find that in all the four models considered, the accuracy on the $H\\_0$ parameter increases by one order of magnitude at 1$\\sigma$ when compared to the SNIa+BAO data set, possibly shedding light in the future on the origin of the $H\\_0$-tension.

Only the contribution of quasi-stationary tides is discussed. Unlike previous studies in this field we present evolution equations derived 'from first principles'. The governing equations contain two groups of terms.   The first group of terms determines the evolution of orbital parameters and inclination angles a 'viscous' time scale. The second group of terms is due to stellar rotation. These terms are present even when dissipation in the star is neglected. Unlike in our 2021 paper we consider all potentially important sources of apsidal precession in an isolated binary, namely precession arising from the tidal distortion and rotation of the primary as well as Einstein precession. We solve these equations numerically for a sample of input parameters, leaving a complete analysis to an accompanying paper. Periodic changes to both the inclination of the rotational axis and its precession rate are found. For a particular binary parameters periodic flips between prograde and retrograde rotation are possible. Also, when the inclination angle is allowed to vary, libration of the apsidal angle becomes possible. Furthermore, when the spin angular momentum is larger than the orbital angular momentum there is a possibility of a significant periodic eccentricity changes.   These phenomena could, in principle, be observed in systems with relatively large inclinations and eccentricities such as e.g. those containing a compact object. In such systems both large inclinations and eccentricities could be generated as a result of a kick applied to the compact object during a supernova explosion.\n\n", "2309.06187": "2023-09-12, **The Three Hundred: $M_{sub}-V_{circ}$ relation**, Atulit Srivastava et.al., [2309.06187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06187v1)\n\n In this study, we investigate a recent finding based on strong lensing observations, which suggests that the sub-halos observed in clusters exhibit greater compactness compared to those predicted by $\\Lambda$CDM simulations.

The sub-halos' cumulative mass function of the GIZMO-SIMBA simulated clusters agrees with observations, while the GADGET-X simulations exhibit discrepancies in the lower sub-halo mass range possibly due to its strong SuperNova feedback. Both GADGET-X and GIZMO-SIMBA simulations demonstrate a redshift evolution of the sub-halo mass function and the $V\\_{max}$ function, with slightly fewer sub-halos observed at lower redshifts. Neither the GADGET-X nor GIZMO-SIMBA(albeit a little closer) simulated clusters' predictions for the $M\\_{\\text{sub}}$-$V\\_{\\text{circ}}$ relation align with the observational result. Further investigations on the correlation between sub-halo/halo properties and the discrepancy in the $M\\_{\\text{sub}}$-$V\\_{\\text{circ}}$ relation reveals that the sub-halo's half mass radius and galaxy stellar age, the baryon fraction and sub-halo distance from the cluster's centre, as well as the halo relaxation state play important roles on this relation.
