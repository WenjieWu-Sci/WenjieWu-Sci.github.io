A scalar field responsible to dilute the dark matter abundance revives the natural inflation.

In our work, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to reconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion typically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of the dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of interest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses significant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on multiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single viewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy emitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second challenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and can only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces an overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal completely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions about the structures in the volume. We instead propose a methodology using a gravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous matter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the weights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward model to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements. We showcase our method on simulations, including realistic simulated measurements of dark matter distributions that mimic data from upcoming telescope surveys.

In contrast to the previously developed doublet formalism, which treats the Wigner degeneracy as a superficial label, the superposition formalism encodes it directly into the structure of a unified field via a coherent superposition of degenerate spinor fields. By imposing the Lorentz covariance, causality, and canonical quantization, we derive nontrivial constraints on the field configuration, which uniquely identify the Elko field as the consistent realization of the Wigner superposition field. Our analysis further clarifies that although the Elko field is a spinor field, it possesses mass dimension one and obeys the Klein-Gordon rather than the Dirac kinematics. Moreover, we explore the general Elko representation through basis redefinitions, showing that certain traditional properties, such as being eigenspinors of charge conjugation, are artifacts of specific basis choices rather than intrinsic features. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of Elko as a dark matter (DM) candidate.

These structures suggest a scenario in which PBHs and DM can exist simultaneously. However, in the high-frequency regime, the gravitational lensing effect of bare PBHs is similar to that of dPBHs. Ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are particularly sensitive to high-frequency GW signals. In this regime, the lensing effect of a point-mass lens with a mass in the range of $10^{-1} \\sim 10^2 M\\_{\\odot}$ becomes significant. In this work, we incorporate dPBH models with GW observations and employ Bayesian inference techniques to distinguish PBHs from dPBHs. Using the third-generation ground-based GW detectors, Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), as examples, we demonstrate that these detectors can effectively differentiate the lensing effects of dPBHs from those of PBHs across a broad frequency range. Furthermore, we find that with a larger black hole (BH) mass inside the surrounding particle DM, ET and CE can distinguish these two lensed models with even greater precision.\n\n", "2504.14944": "2025-04-21, **Haloscope Searching for Dark Photons at Q-band with a Novel Coupling Tuning Structure**, Yue Yin et.al., [2504.14944v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14944v1)\n\n Laboratory searching for dark matter is crucial for understanding several fundamental conundrums in physics and cosmology. Most cavity-based haloscope searches focus on the frequency range below 10 GHz, while the parameter space with higher frequency remains rarely explored, due to the challenges lying in the fabrication of microwave cavities. Here we report the first Q-band haloscope searching for dark photons with a 33.141 GHz cavity. A novel coupling tuning structure separated from the cavity was designed so as not to degrade the quality factor of the cavity. We have established the most stringent constraints $\\chi<2.5\\times10^{-12}$ at a confidence level of 90$\\%$ in the frequency range from 33.139 GHz to 33.143 GHz, corresponding to the mass of dark photons ranging from 137.05 $\\mu$eV to 137.07 $\\mu$eV. The results surpass the previous astronomical constraints by nearly three orders of magnitude. This work has demonstrated the feasibility of dark matter haloscopes at Q band.

Gradual accumulation of heavy, non-annihilating dark matter in neutron stars can lead to the formation of comparable-mass black holes, and non-detection of gravitational waves from mergers of such low-mass black holes can constrain such dark matter interactions with nucleons. These constraints, though dependent on the currently uncertain binary neutron star merger rate density, are significantly more stringent than those from direct detection experiments and provide some of the strongest limits on heavy, non-annihilating dark matter interactions.

While traditional power spectrum methods have been widely used for analyzing the 21cm forest, these techniques are limited in capturing the non-Gaussian nature of the signal. In this work, we introduce the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) as a novel diagnostic tool for the 21cm forest, which allows for the extraction of higher-order statistical features that power spectrum methods cannot easily capture. By decomposing simulated brightness temperature spectra into a hierarchy of scattering coefficients, the WST isolates both local intensity fluctuations (first-order coefficients) and scale-scale correlations (second-order coefficients), revealing the complex, multi-scale non-Gaussian interactions inherent in the 21cm forest. This approach enhances the power of 21cm forest in distinguishing between different cosmological models, such as Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM), as well as scenarios with enhanced X-ray heating. Unlike traditional methods, which focus primarily on Gaussian statistics, the WST captures richer astrophysical and cosmological information.

Their distinctive properties make them valuable cosmological probes and unique laboratories for galaxy formation studies. A key aspect to investigate in this context is the galaxy bias, $b$, within voids - that is, how galaxies in these underdense regions trace the underlying dark-matter density field. We want to measure the dependence of the large-scale galaxy bias on the distance to the void center, and to evaluate whether this bias profile varies with the void properties and identification procedure. We apply a void identification scheme based on spherical overdensities to galaxy data from the IllustrisTNG magnetohydrodynamical simulation. For the clustering measurement, we use an object-by-object estimate of large-scale galaxy bias, which offers significant advantages over the standard method based on ratios of correlation functions or power spectra. We find that the average large-scale bias of galaxies inside voids tends to increase with void-centric distance when normalized by the void radius. For the entire galaxy population within voids, the average bias rises with the density of the surrounding environment and, consequently, decreases with increasing void size. Due to this environmental dependence, the average galaxy bias inside S-type voids - embedded in large-scale overdense regions - is significantly higher ($\\langle b\\rangle\\_{\\rm in} > 0$) at all distances compared to R-type voids, which are surrounded by underdense regions ($\\langle b\\rangle\\_{\\rm in} < 0$). The bias profile for S-type voids is also slightly steeper.

Recently, the DESI collaboration has reported increasing evidence for evolving dark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN), and their new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic due to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's claim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust. A more reliable approach involves constraining the evolution of dark energy using each dataset independently. Through a statistical comparison for each dataset, on average, we find that DDE is strongly preferred over the $\\Lambda$CDM model. This suggests that DDE likely exists, although its real parameter space remains elusive due to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state and inconsistencies among the datasets. Interestingly, when considering DDE, none of the individual datasets -- including CMB, DESI DR2, Pantheon+, Union3, and DESY5 -- can independently detect cosmic acceleration at a significant level. Our findings not only clarify the current understanding of the nature of dark energy but also challenge the established discovery of cosmic acceleration and the long-held notion that dark energy exerts negative pressure.

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to discover up to two orders of magnitude more strongly lensed supernovae per year than have so far been observed. Of these, Type IIn supernovae have been predicted to be detected more frequently than any other supernova type, despite their small relative detection fraction amongst non-lensed supernovae. However, previous studies that predict a large population of lensed Type IIn supernova detections model their time evolving spectrum as a pure blackbody. In reality, there is a deficit in the UV flux of supernovae relative to the blackbody continuum due to line-blanketing from iron-group elements in the ejecta and scattering effects. In this work we quantify the effect of this UV suppression on the detection rates by LSST of a simulated population of strongly lensed Type IIn supernovae, relative to a pure blackbody model, using a mock LSST observing run. With a blackbody model, we predict to detect $\\sim$70 lensed Type IIn supernova per year with LSST.
