As an archetypal model, we consider the Tri-Resonant Leptogensis${}$ (TRL) scenario introduced recently by the authors, where the neutrino-Yukawa coupling matrix is dictated by an approximate $\\mathbb{Z}\\_n$ discrete symmetry (with $n=3,6$). TRL models exhibit no preferred direction in the leptonic flavour space and have the remarkable feature that leptogenesis can successfully take place even if all light neutrinos are strictly massless up to one-loop order. Most interestingly, for TRL scenarios with heavy Majorana neutrinos lighter than 100 GeV, temperature varying degrees of freedom associated with the entropy of the plasma have a dramatic impact on the predictions of the Baryon Asymmetry in the Universe (BAU), and sensitively depend on the freeze-out sphaleron temperature $T\\_{\\rm sph}$. We find that this is a generic feature of most freeze-out low-scale leptogenesis models discussed in the literature. In the same context, we consider heavy-neutrino scenarios realising dynamics related to critical unstable qudits in the thermal plasma and assess their significance in generating the BAU.

This theoretical study provides a complementary testing ground for the proposed neutrino-blazar association. Despite being historically classified as a BL Lac, our study shows that 5BZB J0630-2406 belongs to the relatively rare sub-class of high-power flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Our results indicate that interactions between protons and external radiation fields can produce a neutrino flux that is within the reach of the IceCube detector.

During hydrogen burning stages, neutrino luminosity primarily originates from CNO cycle, and increases with higher stellar mass while decreasing with increasing metallicity. For the high metallicity models (Z = 0.014) during the helium burning stage, the reduction of the hydrogen envelope caused by a larger mass loss rate leads to a gradual decrease in neutrino luminosity. The rapid rotation results in extra mixing inside massive stars, which increases the neutrino luminosity during main sequence (MS), while decreases the neutrino luminosity during helium burning phase. Simultaneously, the rapid rotation also increases CO core mass, which enhances the neutrino luminosity during C and O burning phase. We also investigate the effect of neutrino magnetic moment (NMM) on the massive stars.

The analysis focuses on how the fraction of ICL correlates with halo mass, concentration and fraction of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in a large sample of groups and clusters with $13.0\\leq \\log M\\_{halo} \\leq 15.0$. The fraction of ICL follows a normal distribution, a consequence of the stochastic nature of the physical processes responsible for the formation of the diffuse light. The fractional budget of ICL depends on both halo mass (very weakly) until group scales, and concentration (remarkably). More interestingly, the ICL fraction is higher in more concentrated objects, a result of the stronger tidal forces acting in the innermost regions of the haloes where the concentration is the quantity playing the most relevant role. Our model predictions do not show any dependence between the ICL and ETGs fractions and so, we instead suggest the concentration rather than the mass, as recently claimed, to be the main driver of the ICL formation. The diffuse light starts to form in groups via stellar stripping and mergers and later assembled in more massive objects. However, the formation and assembly keep going on group/cluster scales at lower redshift through the same processes, mainly via stellar stripping in the vicinity of the central regions where tidal forces are stronger.\n\n", "2310.03081": "2023-10-04, **Star formation and AGN activity 500 Myr after the Big Bang: Insights from JWST**, Jordan C.

Gomer et.al., [2310.03077v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03077v1)\n\n Galaxy-scale gravitational lenses are often modeled with two-component mass profiles where one component represents the stellar mass and the second is an NFW profile representing the dark matter. Outside of the spherical case, the NFW profile is costly to implement, and so it is approximated via two different methods; ellipticity can be introduced via the lensing potential (NFWp) or via the mass by approximating the NFW profile as a sum of analytical profiles (NFWm). While the NFWp method has been the default for lensing applications, it gives a different prescription of the azimuthal structure, which we show introduces ubiquitous gradients in ellipticity and boxiness in the mass distribution rather than having a constant elliptical shape. Because unmodeled azimuthal structure has been shown to be able to bias lens model results, we explore the degree to which this introduced azimuthal structure can affect the model accuracy. We construct input profiles using composite models using both the NFWp and NFWm methods and fit these mocks with a power-law elliptical mass distribution (PEMD) model with external shear. As a measure of the accuracy of the recovered lensing potential, we calculate the value of the Hubble parameter $H\\_0$ one would determine from the lensing fit. We find that the fits to the NFWp input return $H\\_0$ values which are systematically biased by about $3\\%$ lower than the NFWm counterparts. We explore whether such an effect is attributable to the mass sheet transformation (MST) by using an MST-independent quantity, $\\xi\\_2$. We show that, as expected, the NFWm mocks are degenerate with PEMD through an MST. For the NFWp, an additional bias is found beyond the MST due to azimuthal structures {\\it exterior to the Einstein radius}.

We present the theoretical methods to compute the single- and few-electron events that arise from secondary radiation emitted by high-energy particles passing through detector materials and perform simulations to quantify them at (Skipper) CCD-based experiments, focusing on the SENSEI data collected in the MINOS cavern at Fermilab. The simulations account for the generation of secondaries from Cherenkov and luminescent recombination; photo-absorption, reflection, refraction and thin-film interference in detector materials; roughness of the interfaces and the dynamics of charges and partial charge collection (PCC) in the doped CCD-backside. We consider several systematic uncertainties, notably those stemming from the backside charge-diffusion modeling, which we estimate with a \"fiducial'' and an \"extreme'' model, with the former model presenting better agreement with PCC data. We find that Cherenkov photons constitute about 40% of the observed single-electron events for both models; radiative recombination rates are negligible for the fiducial model, but can dominate over the Cherenkov rates for the extreme model. We also estimate the fraction of 2-electron events from 1-electron event same-pixel coincidences, finding that the entire 2-electron rate can be explained by coincidences of radiative events and spurious charge. Accounting for backgrounds, we project the sensitivity of future Skipper-CCD-based experiments to different dark-matter models.

We separate the simulated sample in passive early-type galaxies (ETGs), both \"normal\" and \"dwarf\", and active late-type galaxies (LTGs) and show that the mass estimator can accurately predict the galaxy dark masses inside the effective radius in all samples. We finally test the mass estimator against the central mass estimates of a series of low redshift (z$\\leq$0.1) datasets, including SPIDER, MaNGA/DynPop and SAMI dwarf galaxies, derived with standard dynamical methods based on Jeans equations. Dynamical masses are reproduced within 0.30 dex ($\\sim2\\sigma$), with a limited fraction of outliers and almost no bias. This is independent of the sophistication of the kinematical data collected (fiber vs. 3D spectroscopy) and the dynamical analysis adopted (radial vs. axisymmetric Jeans equations, virial theorem).

This study presents a model that classifies possible transonic solutions of galactic winds in the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo and stellar component under spherically symmetric and steady assumptions. Our model includes injections of mass and energy resulting from supernovae feedback along a flow line. The mass flux in galactic winds is a critical factor in determining the acceleration process of the flow and revealing the impact of galactic winds on galaxy evolution. We apply the transonic galactic wind model to the observed outflow velocities of star-forming galaxies to estimate the mass flux. Dividing the mass flux by the star formation rate (SFR) yields the mass loading rate (and mass loading factor), which indicates the entrainment effect of the ISM by the hot gas flow. Our results demonstrate that the mass loading rate is inversely correlated with galaxy mass and SFR. In less massive galaxies (stellar mass $\\sim 10^{7-8} M\\_\\odot$), the mass loading rate exceeds unity, indicating effective ejection of the ISM into intergalactic space. However, in massive galaxies (stellar mass $\\sim 10^{10-11} M\\_\\odot$), the mass loading rate falls below unity, meaning that the mass flux cannot exceed the injected mass by supernovae, thus resulting in the ineffective ejection of the ISM.\n\n", "2310.02595": "2023-10-04, **Effect of low-mass galaxy interactions on their star formation**, Smitha Subramanian et.al., [2310.02595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02595v1)\n\n According to the $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter model of galaxy formation, the hierarchical assembly process is scale-free and interactions between galaxies in all mass ranges are expected.

G189.6+03.3 and IC443 are two examples of supernova remnants located in a region rich of gas and dust, spatially close to the HII region S249. So far, the actual shape of IC443 is believed to be given by the past action of multiple supernova explosions, while a third unrelated might have originated G189.6+03.3.   Aims. If the IC443 nebula has been extensively observed in several bands, in opposite there is an almost complete lack of observations on the nearby and much weaker supernova remnant G189.6+03.3, discovered in 1994 with ROSAT. Given the relatively large extent of this second remnant, the new dataset provided by the X-ray telescope eROSITA onboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) mission gives a unique opportunity to characterize it more in depth.   Methods. We provide a full spectral characterization of G189.6+03.3 emission for the first time, together with new images covering the whole remnant. Since one of the leading hypothesis is that its emission partially overlaps with the emission of IC443, we test this scenario dividing the remnant in several regions from which we extracted the spectra.   Results. The new X-ray images provided by eROSITA show an elongated structure. Together with the detection of supersolar abundances of O, Mg, Ne and Si and subsolar abundance of Fe, these features could be an indication of a faint supernova explosion. The X-ray spectra also highlight the presence of a 0.7 keV plasma component across all the regions together with a column density almost uniform.   Conclusions. The ubiquitous presence of the 0.7 keV plasma component is a strong indication for G189.6+03.3 overlapping completely with IC443. We propose the progenitors of G189.6+03.3 and IC443 could have been hosted in a binary or multiple system, originating two explosions at different times in different positions.\n\n", "2310.03280": "2023-10-05, **Potential of the Cherenkov Telescope Array for studying the young nearby supernova remnants**, Dmitry Prokhorov et.al., [2310.03280v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03280v1)\n\n Modern imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes have extensively observed young nearby supernova remnants (SNRs), with ages of about 1000 years or less, in the very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray band. These efforts resulted in the detection of VHE emission from three young SNRs - Cassiopeia A, Tycho, and SN 1006 - and provided significant evidence for emission from the more distant Kepler's SNR. However, many questions on the production of VHE gamma rays in these remnants remain unanswered. Using detailed physical models for Tycho's SNR based on the CR-hydro-NEI code and physically motivated models for the other young nearby remnants, we simulated observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) of these gamma-ray sources. We highlight properties of these remnants accessible for investigation with future CTA observations and discuss which questions are expected to be answered.\n\n", "2310.03075": "2023-10-04, **Probing the early Milky Way with GHOST spectra of an extremely metal-poor star in the Galactic disk**, Anya Dovgal et.al., [2310.03075v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03075v1)\n\n Pristine\\_183.6849+04.8619 (P1836849) is an extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H]$=-3.3\\pm0.1$) star on a prograde orbit confined to the Galactic disk. Such stars are rare and may have their origins in protogalactic fragments that formed the early Milky Way, in low mass satellites that were later accreted by the Galaxy, or forming in situ in the Galactic plane. Here we present a chemo-dynamical analysis of the spectral features between $3700-11000$\\r{A} from a high-resolution spectrum taken during Science Verification of the new Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST). Spectral features for many chemical elements are analysed (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni), and valuable upper limits are determined for others (C, Na, Sr, Ba), which are all important tracers of the earliest epochs of star formation in the Galaxy. This main sequence star exhibits several rare chemical signatures, including (i) extremely low metallicity for a star in the Galactic disk, (ii) very low abundances of the light $\\alpha$-elements (Na, Mg, Si) compared to metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo or disk, and (iii) unusually large abundances of Cr and Mn, where [Cr, Mn/Fe]$\\_{\\rm NLTE}>+0.5$. A simple comparison to theoretical yields from supernova models suggests that two low mass Population III objects (one 10 M$\\_\\odot$ supernova and one 17 M$\\_\\odot$ hypernova) can reproduce the abundance pattern well (reduced $\\chi^2<1$). When this star is compared to two other extremely metal-poor stars with planar orbits, differences in both chemistry and kinematics imply there is little evidence for a common origin.

The two $z>5$ quiescent systems (JADES-GS-z7-01-QU and MACS0417-z5BBG) detected so far show a recent starburst after which SF is suppressed. To clarify whether such quenching is due to supernova (SN) feedback, we have developed a minimal physical model. We derive a condition on the minimum star formation rate, $\\rm SFR\\_{min}$, lasting for a time interval $\\Delta t\\_{b}$, required to quench SF in a galaxy at redshift $z$, with gas metallicity $Z$, and hosted by a halo of mass $M\\_h$. We find that lower $(z, Z, M\\_h)$ systems are more easily quenched.

Alternatively, we suggest that SF is rapidly suppressed by radiation-driven dusty outflows sustained by the high specific SFR (43 and 25 Gyr$^{-1}$, respectively) of the two galaxies. Our model provides a simple tool to interpret the SF histories of post-starburst galaxies, and unravel quenching mechanisms from incoming JWST data.\n\n", "2310.02916": "2023-10-04, **Rainbow: a colorful approach on multi-passband light curve estimation**, E. Russeil et.al., [2310.02916v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02916v2)\n\n We present Rainbow, a physically motivated framework which enables simultaneous multi-band light curve fitting. It allows the user to construct a 2-dimensional continuous surface across wavelength and time, even in situations where the number of observations in each filter is significantly limited. Assuming the electromagnetic radiation emission from the transient can be approximated by a black-body, we combined an expected temperature evolution and a parametric function describing its bolometric light curve. These three ingredients allow the information available in one passband to guide the reconstruction in the others, thus enabling a proper use of multi-survey data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to simulated data from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) as well as real data from the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE DR1). We evaluate the quality of the estimated light curves according to three different tests: goodness of fit, time of peak prediction and ability to transfer information to machine learning (ML) based classifiers. Results confirm that Rainbow leads to equivalent (SNII) or up to 75% better (SN Ibc) goodness of fit when compared to the Monochromatic approach. Similarly, accuracy when using Rainbow best-fit values as a parameter space in multi-class ML classification improves for all classes in our sample. An efficient implementation of Rainbow has been publicly released as part of the light curve package at https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python. Our approach enables straight forward light curve estimation for objects with observations in multiple filters and from multiple experiments. It is particularly well suited for situations where light curve sampling is sparse.\n\n", "2310.02828": "2023-10-04, **Prospects for a survey of the Galactic plane with the Cherenkov Telescope Array**, CTA Consortium et.al., [2310.02828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02828v1)\n\n Approximately one hundred sources of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays are known in the Milky Way. A survey of the entire Galactic Plane in the energy range from a few tens of GeV to a few hundred TeV has been proposed as a Key Science Project for the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). This article presents the status of the studies towards the Galactic Plane Survey (GPS). We build and make publicly available a sky model that combines data from observations of known gamma-ray emitters with state-of-the-art physically-driven models of synthetic populations of the main classes of established Galactic VHE sources, as well as of interstellar emission from cosmic-ray interactions in the Milky Way. We also perform an optimisation of the observation strategy. We use the improved sky model and observation strategy to simulate GPS data that are analysed using the methods and software tools under development for real data. We show that the GPS has the potential to increase the number of known Galactic VHE emitters by almost a factor of five. This corresponds to the detection of more than two hundred pulsar wind nebulae and a few tens of supernova remnants at average integral fluxes one order of magnitude lower than in the existing sample above 1 TeV, therefore opening the possibility to perform unprecedented population studies. The GPS also has the potential to provide new VHE detections of binary systems and pulsars, and to identify any bright PeVatrons. Furthermore, the GPS will constitute a pathfinder for deeper follow-up observations of these source classes. Finally, we show that we can extract from GPS data an estimate of the contribution to diffuse emission from unresolved sources, and that there are good prospects of detecting interstellar emission and statistically distinguishing different scenarios.

This study presents a model that classifies possible transonic solutions of galactic winds in the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo and stellar component under spherically symmetric and steady assumptions. Our model includes injections of mass and energy resulting from supernovae feedback along a flow line. The mass flux in galactic winds is a critical factor in determining the acceleration process of the flow and revealing the impact of galactic winds on galaxy evolution. We apply the transonic galactic wind model to the observed outflow velocities of star-forming galaxies to estimate the mass flux. Dividing the mass flux by the star formation rate (SFR) yields the mass loading rate (and mass loading factor), which indicates the entrainment effect of the ISM by the hot gas flow. Our results demonstrate that the mass loading rate is inversely correlated with galaxy mass and SFR. In less massive galaxies (stellar mass $\\sim 10^{7-8} M\\_\\odot$), the mass loading rate exceeds unity, indicating effective ejection of the ISM into intergalactic space. However, in massive galaxies (stellar mass $\\sim 10^{10-11} M\\_\\odot$), the mass loading rate falls below unity, meaning that the mass flux cannot exceed the injected mass by supernovae, thus resulting in the ineffective ejection of the ISM.\n\n", "2310.02558": "2023-10-04, **New Dynamical Channel: Wide Binaries in the Galactic Center as a Source of Binary Interactions**, Erez Michaely et.al., [2310.02558v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02558v1)\n\n The inner $500\\rm pc$ in the galactic center is dense with stars and a dynamically hot environment. Here, we focus on wide binaries as a source of tidally or collisional interactions. These binaries were previously ignored as sources of binary interaction because they are too wide to have a close pericenter passage, or they will quickly become unbound (ionized) due to gravitational interactions with passing neighbors. However, we show that wide binaries tend to interact more frequently with neighboring stars due to their larger cross-section for gravitational impulse interactions. These interactions mainly torque the wide system, causing it to change its eccentricity. As a result, the eccentricity might be excited to sufficiently high values, causing the binary to interact at the pericenter. As a proof of concept, we present four channels of such interactions: binary main-sequence (MS), white-dwarf (WD) - MS, black hole - MS, and lastly, WD-WD. During Galaxy's lifetime, we predict tens of thousands of MS-MS interacting binaries that may form G2-like objects later appear younger than their environment. X-ray signatures and, perhaps, supernovae may result from thousands of WD-MS and WD-WD interacting binaries from this channel. Lastly, we predict a few hundred BH-MS interacting binaries at the inner $500$~pc.\n\n"}}
