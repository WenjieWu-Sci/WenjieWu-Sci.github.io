Given the different neutrino energy spectra and nuclear targets employed by the three experiments, comparisons of model predictions to their measurements breaks degeneracies that would be present in any single measurement. In particular, the comparison of T2K and MINERvA measurements offers a probe of energy dependence, whilst a comparison of T2K and MicroBooNE investigates scaling with nuclear target. In order to isolate the impact of individual nuclear effects, model comparisons are made following systematic alterations to: the nuclear ground state; final state interactions and multi-nucleon interaction strength. The measurements are further compared to the generators used as an input to DUNE/SBN and T2K/Hyper-K analyses. Whilst no model is able to quantitatively describe all the measurements, evidence is found for mis-modelling of A-scaling in multi-nucleon interactions and it is found that tight control over how energy is distributed among hadrons following final state interactions is likely to be crucial to achieving improved agreement.

On one hand, there has been a significant increase in the observation of transient phenomena, which are short-lived events such as supernova explosions, fast radio bursts, and gamma-ray bursts. In addition, the detection of a growing number of different cosmic messengers provides researchers with crucial information about these objects. For example, the detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves regularly complements traditional astronomical observations in the electromagnetic spectrum. This trend is expected to intensify in the coming years with the commissioning of a wide variety of next-generation observatories, which will enable more in-depth studies of the transient sky.   To enhance our understanding and optimize the observations of these phenomena, we have developed the Astro-COLIBRI platform. It is freely available to amateur and professional astronomers in the form of a smartphone application (iOS and Android), a web interface, an API, and a chatbot 'Astro-COLIBRI GPT', among many other features. Astro-COLIBRI serves as a central access point for information on astrophysical sources and transient events, allowing a wide network of observers to track and receive real-time alerts.

An example of application for this kind of detectors are Compton polarimeters such as POLAR-2 or LEAP, for which a low-Z material is needed for the Compton effect to be dominant down to as low energy as possible. Such detectors aim to measure low energy Compton depositions which produce small amounts of optical light, and for which optimizing the instrumental optical properties consequently imperative.   The light collection efficiency of such a device was studied with a focus on the POLAR-2 GRB polarimeter, in which the conversion of incoming $\\gamma$-rays into readable signal goes through the production and collection of optical light, which was to be optimized both through measurements and simulations. The optical elements of the POLAR-2 polarimeter prototype module were optically characterized and an optical simulation based on Geant4 was developed to fully model its optical performances. The results from simulations were used to optimize the design and finally to verify its performance. The study resulted in a detector capable of measuring energy depositions of several keV. In addition an important finding of this work is the impact of the plastic scintillator surface roughness on the light collection. It was found that a plastic scintillator with a higher scintillation efficiency but made of a softer material, hence with a rougher surface, was not necessarily the best option to optimize the light collection. Furthermore, in order to optimize the optical crosstalk between different channels, a production technique for very thin ($\\sim$150$~\\mu$m) and reusable silicone-based optical coupling pads, which can be applied for other experiments, was developed.\n\n", "2407.10717": "2024-07-15, **Search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons in proton-proton collision events with a lepton-jet pair associated with a secondary vertex at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV**, CMS Collaboration et.al., [2407.10717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10717v1)\n\n A search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$ collected at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC is presented.

For these even dimensions, the vacuum energy density has the universal form $\\rho\\_{\\rm vac} \\propto m^D/\\mathfrak{g}$ where $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a dimensionless interaction coupling constant which can be determined from the high energy behavior of the S-matrix.

In the theoretical modeling of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), there has been a great deal of attention to recent discoveries of a new type of neutrino flavor conversions, namely collisional flavor instability (CFI), in which the instability is induced by the flavor-dependent decoherence due to the disparity of neutrino-matter interactions among flavors. In this paper, we study how the appearance of on-shell muons and associated neutrino-matter interactions can impact CFIs based on linear stability analysis of flavor conversions. Some striking results emerge from the present study. First, we analytically show that breaking beta- and pair equilibrium is a necessary condition to trigger CFIs. This also indicates that CFIs with on-shell muons could appear in $e \\tau$ and $\\mu \\tau$ neutrino mixing sectors in very high-density region ($\\gtrsim 10^{13} {\\rm g/cm^{3}}$), exhibiting a possibility of large impacts of CFIs on CCSN. Second, resonance-like CFIs, having a much higher growth rate than normal CFIs, can be triggered by muons. The resonance point of CFIs is different between $e \\tau$ and $\\mu \\tau$ sectors; the former (latter) occurs at $\\mu\\_{e (\\mu)} = \\mu\\_{n} - \\mu\\_{p}$, where $\\mu\\_{i}$ denotes the chemical potential of $i$ constitute ($n$ and $p$ represent neutrons and protons, respectively).

Further combining this with the requirement to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis reduces these bands to windows in parameter space that are constrained in all directions and can be targeted by direct searches at accelerators. For a normal mass hierarchy, only parts of the parameter space can be probed by such experiments.\n\n", "2407.10422": "2024-07-15, **A Semi-Empirical Formula for Two-Neutrino Double-Beta Decay**, Ovidiu Ni\u0163escu et.al., [2407.10422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10422v1)\n\n We propose a semi-empirical formula for calculating the nuclear matrix elements for two-neutrino double-beta decay.

The extreme precision and accuracy of forthcoming observations of CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, aiming to detect the tiny signatures of primordial gravitational waves or of light relic particles beyond the standard three light neutrinos, requires commensurate precision in the modelling of foreground Galactic emission that contaminates CMB observations.   Aims. We evaluate the impact of second-order effects in Galactic foreground emission due to Thomson scattering off interstellar free electrons and to Rayleigh scattering off interstellar dust particles.   Methods. We use existing sky survey data and models of the distribution of free electrons and dust within the Milky Way to estimate the amplitude and power spectra of the emission originating from radiation scattered either by free electrons or by dust grains at CMB frequencies.   Results. Both processes generate corrections to the total emission that are small compared to direct emission, and are small enough not to pose problems for current-generation observations.   Conclusions. However, B-modes generated by Thomson scattering of incoming radiation by interstellar free electrons at CMB frequencies are within an order of magnitude of the sensitivity of the most advanced forthcoming CMB telescopes, and might require more precise evaluation in the future.\n\n", "2407.10357": "2024-07-14, **Solar neutrino capture by 128, 130Te isotopes and Baksan Large Neutrino Telescope Project**, A.

An important exception to this inefficiency is regions of high gravitational accelerations $g$, or equivalently surface densities $\\Sigma = g/(\\pi\\,G)$, where stellar feedback is insufficient to overcome the self-gravity of dense gas clouds. In this paper, I explore whether dark matter can play an analogous role in providing the requisite accelerations on the scale of entire galaxies in the early cosmos. The key insight is that characteristic accelerations in dark matter halos scale as $(1+z)^2$ at fixed halo mass. I show this is sufficient to make dark matter the source of intense accelerations that might induce efficient star formation on galactic scales at cosmic dawn in sufficiently massive halos. The mass characterizing this regime scales as $(1+z)^{-6}$ and corresponds to a relatively constant comoving number density of $n(>\\!M\\_{\\rm vir}) \\approx 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \\gtrsim 8$.

The orbits in spike around a primordial black hole are very elongated, almost radial, and the angular momentum distribution has an exponential form. For such an initial distribution function, it is obtained that a cusp with the exponent $\\approx-0.7$ is formed in the central region, instead of an annihilation plateau.

We consider observers to be located in dark matter halos and compute the distribution of the estimated value of $H\\_0$ across all such observers.

We also analyse the cumulative effect of such errors on mock measurements of $H\\_0$ as measured from Milky Way-sized halos. We find that this error is sensitive to the lowest distance at which we use measurements. The distribution of $H\\_0$ in mock measurements has a large tail, and deviations of a few percent from the global value cannot be ruled out.\n\n", "2407.10123": "2024-07-14, **Gravitational Wave Signatures of First-Order Phase Transition in Two-Component Dark Matter Model**, Seyed Yaser Ayazi et.al., [2407.10123v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10123v1)\n\n Here, we consider a classically scale-invariant extension of the Standard Model (SM) with two-component dark matter (DM) candidates, including a Dirac spinor and a scalar DM. We probe the parameter space of the model, constrained by relic density and direct detection, and investigate the generation of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by an electroweak first-order phase transition (EFOPT). The analysis demonstrates that there are points in the parameter space, leading to a detectable GW spectrum arising from the first-order phase transition, which is also consistent with the DM relic abundance and direct detection bounds. These GWs could be observed by forthcoming space-based interferometers such as the Big Bang Observer (BBO), Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO), and Ultimate-DECIGO (UDECIGO).\n\n", "2407.10103": "2024-07-14, **From SuperBIT to GigaBIT: Informing next-generation balloon-borne telescope design with Fine Guidance System flight data**, Philippe Voyer et.al., [2407.10103v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10103v1)\n\n The Super-pressure Balloon-borne Imaging Telescope (SuperBIT) is a near-diffraction-limited 0.5m telescope that launched via NASA's super-pressure balloon technology on April 16, 2023. SuperBIT achieved precise pointing control through the use of three nested frames in conjunction with an optical Fine Guidance System (FGS), resulting in an average image stability of 0.055\" over 300-second exposures. The SuperBIT FGS includes a tip-tilt fast-steering mirror that corrects for jitter on a pair of focal plane star cameras. In this paper, we leverage the empirical data from SuperBIT's successful 45-night stratospheric mission to inform the FGS design for the next-generation balloon-borne telescope. The Gigapixel Balloon-borne Imaging Telescope (GigaBIT) is designed to be a 1.35m wide-field, high resolution imaging telescope, with specifications to extend the scale and capabilities beyond those of its predecessor SuperBIT. A description and analysis of the SuperBIT FGS will be presented along with methodologies for extrapolating this data to enhance GigaBIT's FGS design and fine pointing control algorithm. We employ a systems engineering approach to outline and formalize the design constraints and specifications for GigaBIT's FGS. GigaBIT, building on the SuperBIT legacy, is set to enhance high-resolution astronomical imaging, marking a significant advancement in the field of balloon-borne telescopes.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2407.10929": "2024-07-15, **Evidence of gradients of density and magnetic field in the remnant of Tycho's supernova**, Oleh Petruk et.al., [2407.10929v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10929v1)\n\n By using surface brightness maps of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) in radio and X-rays, along with the properties of thermal and synchrotron emission, we have derived the post-shock density and magnetic field strength distributions over the projection of this remnant. Our analysis reveals a density gradient oriented towards the north-west, while the magnetic field strength gradient aligns with the Galactic plane, pointing eastward. Additionally, utilizing this magnetic field map, we have derived the spatial distributions of the cut-off frequency and maximum energy of electrons in Tycho's SNR. We further comment on the implications of these findings for interpreting the gamma-ray emission from Tycho's SNR.\n\n", "2407.10845": "2024-07-15, **Inferring dark energy properties from the scale factor parametrisation**, Upala Mukhopadhayay et.al., [2407.10845v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10845v1)\n\n We propose and implement a novel test to assess deviations from well-established concordance $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology while inferring dark energy properties. In contrast to the commonly implemented parametric forms of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS), we test the validity of the cosmological constant on the more fundamental scale factor [$a(t)$] which determines the expansion rate of the Universe. We constrain our extended `general model' for the expansion history using the late-time cosmological observables, namely Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae. As a primary inference, we contrast the BAO compilations from the completed SDSS and the more recent DESI. We find that the former deviates from the $\\Lambda$CDM scenario at a mild $\\sim 2\\sigma$ level while the latter is completely consistent with the standard picture when the dark energy properties are inferred. We find that the posterior of the dark energy EoS is mainly constrained to be quintessence-like, however, we demonstrate the rich phenomenology of dark energy behaviour that can be obtained in our general model wrt to the $\\Lambda$CDM.\n\n", "2407.10729": "2024-07-15, **Testing the Molecular Cloud Paradigm for Ultra-High-Energy Gamma Ray Emission from the Direction of SNR G106.3+2.7**, R. Alfaro et.al., [2407.10729v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10729v1)\n\n Supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be capable of accelerating cosmic rays (CRs) to PeV energies. SNR G106.3+2.7 is a prime PeVatron candidate. It is formed by a head region, where the pulsar J2229+6114 and its boomerang-shaped pulsar wind nebula are located, and a tail region containing SN ejecta. The lack of observed gamma ray emission from the two regions of this SNR has made it difficult to assess which region would be responsible for the PeV CRs. We aim to characterize the very-high-energy (VHE, 0.1-100 TeV) gamma ray emission from SNR G106.3+2.7 by determining the morphology and spectral energy distribution of the region. This is accomplished using 2565 days of data and improved reconstruction algorithms from the HAWC Observatory. We also explore possible gamma ray production mechanisms for different energy ranges. Using a multi-source fitting procedure based on a maximum-likelihood estimation method, we evaluate the complex nature of this region. We determine the morphology, spectrum, and energy range for the source found in the region. Molecular cloud information is also used to create a template and evaluate the HAWC gamma ray spectral properties at ultra-high-energies (UHE, >56 TeV). This will help probe the hadronic nature of the highest-energy emission from the region. We resolve one extended source coincident with all other gamma ray observations of the region. The emission reaches above 100~TeV and its preferred log-parabola shape in the spectrum shows a flux peak in the TeV range. The molecular cloud template fit on the higher energy data reveals that the SNR's energy budget is fully capable of producing a purely hadronic source for UHE gamma rays.\n\n", "2407.10470": "2024-07-15, **Forecast of strongly lensed supernovae rates in the China Space Station Telescope surveys**, Jiang Dong et.al., [2407.10470v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10470v1)\n\n Strong gravitationally lensed supernovae (SNe) are a powerful probe for cosmology and stellar physics. The relative time delays between lensed SN images provide an independent way of measuring a fundamental cosmological parameter -- the Hubble constant -- , the value of which is currently under debate. The time delays also serve as a ``time machine'', offering a unique opportunity to capture the extremely early phase of the SN explosion, which can be used to constrain the SN progenitor and explosion mechanism. Although there are only a handful of strongly lensed SN discoveries so far, which greatly hinders scientific applications, the sample size is expected to grow substantially with next-generation surveys. In this work, we investigate the capability of detecting strongly lensed SNe with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), a two-meter space telescope to be launched around 2026. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that CSST can detect 1008.53 and 51.78 strongly lensed SNe from its Wide Field Survey (WFS, covering 17,500 deg$^2$) and Deep Field Survey (DFS, covering 400 deg$^2$) over the course of ten years. In both surveys, about 35\\% of the events involve Type Ia SNe as the background sources. Our results suggest that the WFS and DFS of CSST, although not designed or optimized for discovering transients, can still make a great contribution to the strongly lensed SNe studies.\n\n"}}
