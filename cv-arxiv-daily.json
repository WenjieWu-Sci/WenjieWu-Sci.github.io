Such a singly-charged scalar is naturally accommodated in an extremely well-motivated neutrino mass model, namely, the Type-II seesaw model. This model, beside providing a viable explanation of neutrino mass generation, also allows for lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes. Since LFV processes are not allowed in the Standard Model (SM), we focus on the discovery prospect of the singly-charged scalar in the Type-II seesaw model at $\u03bc$TRISTAN through a LFV process, owing to the advantage of this process being free of any SM background. Additionally, this article also proposes a method to indicate if the underlying theory follows a Normal or an Inverted hierarchy depending on the distribution of lepton flavors in the final state.\n\n", "2601.21432": "2026-01-29, **Cosmological analysis of the DESI DR1 Lyman alpha 1D power spectrum**, J.

We capture the dependence of the signal on cosmology and intergalactic medium physics using an emulator trained on a cosmological suite of hydrodynamical simulations, and we correct its predictions for the impact of astrophysical contaminants and systematics, many of these not considered in previous analyses.

Considering two plausible scenarios, AGN jets and winds, we model the X-ray, GeV, and TeV emission during both TeV-low (quasi-quiet) and TeV-high (active) states. The spectral energy distributions can be explained either by single-zone leptonic emission from moderately relativistic jets or by lepto-hadronic emission from sub-relativistic winds. The best-fit parameters suggest that the transition from the quasi-quiet to the active state may be driven jointly by an enhanced accretion rate and the expansion of jets or winds. We further show that future MeV and very-high-energy $\u03b3$-ray observations can discriminate between the {leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios}. Although the neutrino flux from NGC~1068 predicted by the wind model is too low to be detected with current neutrino observatories, a lepto-hadronic wind scenario can account for the PeV diffuse neutrino background when adopting a local LLAGN density corrected for the TeV duty cycle, $n\\_{\\rm L,0}(\u0394T\\_{\\rm TeV}/T) \\sim 10^{-5}~\\rm Mpc^{-3}$, as inferred from the LHAASO detection.\n\n", "2601.21373": "2026-01-29, **Scaling Properties of Two-Particle-Two-Hole Responses in Asymmetric Nuclei for Neutrino Scattering within the Relativistic Mean-Field Framework**, V.

We present microscopic calculations of nuclear responses for a set of 17 nuclei, ranging from helium to uranium, using a model with different Fermi momenta for protons and neutrons. We propose a novel scaling prescription based on the two-particle phase space and key nuclear parameters. The resulting description is accurate over a wide range of nuclear targets, with typical deviations below 10\\%, and allows for a separate treatment of the different emission channels.

We demonstrate that when realistic spatial variations of the Earths density are taken into account, the oscillation probabilities acquire additional, energy dependent structures that cannot be captured by path-averaged density approximations. We show that mismodeling of the matter density profile can introduce degeneracies that obscure genuine leptonic CP violating effects, thereby degrading parameter sensitivity and biasing the inference of the CP phase. Identifying energy regions in which CP sensitivity remains robust against matter density uncertainties is therefore essential. These considerations indicate that marginalization over a single effective density parameter is insufficient for next generation precision measurements and motivate the incorporation of spatially resolved Earth density profiles in the analysis frameworks of future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.\n\n", "2601.21155": "2026-01-29, **Nucleon axial-vector form factor and radius from radiatively-corrected antineutrino scattering data**, Oleksandr Tomalak et.al., [2601.21155v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21155v1)\n\n The nucleon axial-vector form factor, $G\\_A$, is critical to determine the electroweak interactions of leptons with nucleons.

It is typically acquired on-site from generators containing $^{99}$Mo, in turn produced at nuclear reactor facilities. This supply chain involves multiple points of vulnerability, which can lead to shortages and delays with potentially negative patient outcomes. We report on the development of a new family of cyclotrons originally designed for the IsoDAR neutrino experiment, capable of operating at much higher current than typical cyclotrons. When operated with deuterons at 1.5 MeV/amu and an anticipated continuous beam current of 5 mA, simulations project that such a system would yield $\\sim$10$^{13}$ neutrons per second using a thin beryllium target. This neutron yield is sufficient, in principle, to support $^{99}$Mo production without the use of highly enriched uranium or reliance on foreign reactors. Simulations and conceptual design studies suggest that the system's beam dynamics could make it a viable pathway toward decentralized, hospital-based isotope generation. The relatively low energy of the deuterons minimizes activation and safety concerns.

Successful and choked jets, as well as the accretion disk, corona, wind, and outflow regions in a TDE have been examined and shown to produce TeV - PeV neutrinos. In this work, we use the IceCube 12.5 year high energy starting events (HESE) dataset and perform a maximum likelihood analysis to investigate the spatial and temporal correlations between HESE dataset and a selected sample of 89 TDEs. Our results indicate that the currently observed data do not show any significant correlation and hence is consistent with the background only hypothesis. Using this result, we place constraints on the fraction of TDEs harboring intrinsic jets ($f\\_{\\rm jet}$) and the corresponding isotropic-equivalent cosmic ray (CR) energy ($\\mathcal{E}\\_{\\rm CR}$).

In such a setup, we employ a model-independent approach to investigate the signature of sterile neutrinos in the half-life of the neutrinoless double beta ($0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2$) decay process. In particular, we aim to study the contribution of sterile neutrinos in the mass range $\\sim$~keV that is motivated by the dark matter constituent of the Universe. Further, the masses of the sterile neutrinos are determined by the active neutrino masses, mixing angles, and phases, and active-sterile mixing angles and $CP$-violating phases. The parameter space is constrained by the exact seesaw relation, thereby making the analysis constrained. After capturing the parameter space that can account for $\\sim~$keV scale masses for the sterile neutrinos, we adopt the chiral effective field theory approach to calculate the half-life and effective mass in the $0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2$ decay. As the study transitions from the TeV scale to scenarios involving at least one sterile neutrino in the keV mass range, it reveals a significant modification of the effective mass. In particular, the cancellation region associated with the normal mass hierarchy for TeV-scale sterile neutrinos no longer persists when a keV-scale sterile neutrino is introduced, resulting in a finite effective mass that future experiments can probe. Likewise, the involvement of keV-scale sterile neutrino in the inverted mass hierarchy case makes the band distorted and scattered points appear around the main band.\n\n", "2601.20313": "2026-01-28, **Mathematical Anatomy of Neutrino Decoherence in Red Turbulence: A Fractional Calculus Approach**, Yiwei Bao et.al., [2601.20313v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20313v2)\n\n We present a comprehensive study of perturbation theory for neutrino decoherence in power-law correlated turbulent matter, establishing rigorous convergence criteria and providing detailed numerical validation. Starting from the exact Laplace-space solution derived from the generalized master equation with memory kernel $K(t) \\propto t^{-\u03bd}e^{-t/\u03c4\\_c}$, we develop a systematic perturbation expansion in the turbulence strength parameter $\u03be$. The expansion is performed around the high-density matter basis where $\\cos 2\u03b8\\_m \\approx 1$, rather than the vacuum basis, reflecting the physical conditions in supernova cores. We obtain explicit expressions for the first few perturbation terms and derive the general structure of higher-order terms, which involve Mittag-Leffler functions that emerge from the fractional dynamics. Using high-precision numerical methods (multiple-precision arithmetic and asymptotic expansions), we analyze the convergence radius and rate of the perturbation series. We find that for $\u03be< \u03be\\_c \\approx 0.8$, the series converges with error decreasing geometrically. For $\u03be= 0.16$ (typical supernova conditions), third-order perturbation theory achieves $\\sim 1\\%$ accuracy. We provide practical guidelines for applying perturbation theory to realistic astrophysical scenarios and validate all analytical results with extensive numerical computations. Our work clarifies several subtle aspects of the perturbative approach that were not addressed in the original literature, offering a complete toolkit for researchers studying neutrino-turbulence interactions. In particular, we systematically address the ultraviolet divergence of the correlation function at short time scales for spectral indices $\u03bd\\geq 1$, introducing a physical small-scale cutoff regularization that ensures mathematical rigor for the fractional master equation and perturbative expansion.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2601.21848": "2026-01-29, **Compact Stars Sourced by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter Halos**, Yuan Yue et.al., [2601.21848v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21848v1)\n\n Recent studies have shown that dark matter halos can support regular black holes or compact stars by assuming an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor. In this paper, we extend the analysis to the dark matter halo as an isotropic perfect fluid. By employing galactic dark matter profiles-specifically the Einasto and Dehnen models-as the mass-energy density source, we numerically solve the Einstein field equations and find a class of non-singular, horizonless compact star solutions.

Focusing on the ULDM Jeans scale, we identify the critical conditions under which high-redshift baryonic gas, strongly confined by central solitonic cores of the halos, undergoes direct and monolithic collapse. The solitonic potential naturally drives rapid inflow and shock heating, allowing the gas to exceed the critical atomic-cooling and fragmentation-suppression threshold of $\\sim 3 \\times 10^4 {\\rm K}$ without invoking an external UV background. We derive semi-analytic relations for the halo mass, soliton mass, baryonic core radius, and thermodynamic state of the gas, including the effects of baryonic contraction. These relations simultaneously determine the minimum and maximum SMBH seed masses as functions of redshift. In this framework, pristine gas clouds that satisfy the temperature threshold collapse without fragmentation, forming SMBH seeds with characteristic masses of order $\\sim 10^5M\\_\\odot$, while systems below the threshold are expected to form compact star clusters instead. Our model also implies an upper limit on the attainable SMBH mass, predicting a maximum mass scale of order $\\sim10^{10}M\\_\\odot$, consistent with the most massive quasars observed to date. The ULDM particle mass required to reproduce the inferred seed mass scale, $m \\simeq 10^{-22}{\\rm eV}$, coincides with the value favored by galactic-scale observations, providing a unified explanation for the characteristic masses of both galactic cores and early SMBH seeds.

Recent research indicates a noticeable decline in the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way (MW), suggesting the need for a new low-mass model to describe its dynamical features. This study constructs a new Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger model to characterize the RC features of our galaxy. We use the GIZMO code to simulate mergers with various orbital parameters to investigate how the disk warp evolves under different conditions. This simulation demonstrates the evolutionary mechanism of disk warp, which arises due to the asymmetric gravitational potential of the dark matter (DM) halo generated universally by galaxy mergers. The results indicate that the tilt angle of the DM halo partly reflects the gravitational strength at the $Z=0$ plane, while the gravitational strength on the disk plane reflects the amplitude of disk warp. We identify a dual-regime interaction mechanism driven by the asymmetric halo potential. On short timescales, we find a distinct anti-correlation between the halo's tilt angle and the disk's warp amplitude, indicating a `seesaw' mechanism of angular momentum exchange. On secular timescales, however, dynamical friction drives a global alignment, causing both the halo tilt and the warp amplitude to decay simultaneously. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-inclination mergers can sustain long-lived prograde precession, where the persistent yet decaying gravitational torque maintains the prograde bending mode against differential wind-up.\n\n", "2601.21361": "2026-01-29, **Search for dimuon resonance in the 35 to 75 GeV mass range using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector**, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., [2601.21361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21361v1)\n\n A model-independent search for low-mass resonances decaying into pairs of oppositely charged muons is presented.

The search targets hypothetical dimuon resonances in the invariant mass range from 35 GeV to 75 GeV. The modelling of this mass region is particularly challenging for conventional analytic background parameterisations. To address this, a Gaussian process regression technique is used to model the background. The dimuon mass spectrum is analysed for potential signals, and no statistically significant excess is observed. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the fiducial production cross-section of new resonances decaying promptly into muons, ranging from 20 fb to 110 fb, depending on the resonance mass.

The effect of internal properties and galaxy interactions on bar pattern speeds**, Alex Merrow et.al., [2601.20941v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20941v1)\n\n One of the main properties of galactic bars is their rotation (or pattern) speed, which is driven by both internal galactic properties, as well as external interactions. To assess the influence of these internal and external drivers on bar rotation in a cosmological setting, we use the Auriga suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations. We calculate the bar pattern speed and the bar rotation rate - the ratio of corotation radius to bar length - at the time of bar formation and at z=0, and compare these to bar age, bar strength, baryon dominance, galaxy stellar mass, and the history of external galaxy interactions. We find that galaxies which are more baryon dominated at z=0 - and which lie above the observed stellar mass-halo mass abundance matching relation - host faster bars, while more dark matter dominated galaxies host slower bars. Baryon-dominated galaxies also form their bars earlier and their rotation rates stay constant or even decrease over time; this leads to older bars being faster than their younger counterparts - in contrast to the expectation of bar slow-down from dynamical friction imparted by the dark matter halo. We also find a trend in stellar mass, with 'faster' bars being hosted in more massive galaxies, which could be driven by the underlying higher baryon-dominance of more massive galaxies. Furthermore, we find that external interactions, such as mergers and flybys, correlate with lower bar rotation rates, particularly for strong interactions that occur around bar formation time. This correlation is relatively weak, leaving internal baryon-dominance as the main driver of fast bar rotation rates.\n\n", "2601.20826": "2026-01-28, **Euclid preparation.

In this paper, we calculate the graviton bremsstrahlung energy spectrum arising from the decay of the heavy scalar or VLQ in the KSVZ model. The result shows that these heavy particles can emit ultrahigh-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), with the peak frequency depending on the model's parameter inputs.

We summarize two complementary machine-learning approaches developed within CYGNO. First, we present a fast and fully unsupervised strategy for online data reduction based on reconstruction-based anomaly detection. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images (i.e. frames acquired with GEM amplification disabled) learns the detector noise morphology and highlights particle-induced structures through localized reconstruction residuals, from which compact Regions of Interest (ROIs) are extracted.

We investigate the spatial clustering properties of 225,382 quasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) within the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 footprint, split by the statistically-calculated fraction of their radio flux densities contributed by jets (relative to the contribution from star formation). We find a positive correlation between the clustering strengths of quasars and their jet fraction, where quasars with a higher jet fraction have a higher clustering amplitude measured by their two-point correlation functions. We show that this correlation is unlikely related to differences in BH masses or bolometric luminosities. Quasars dominated by powerful jet activities generally reside in dark matter haloes $10-100$ times more massive than those without strong jets, with typical halo masses of $10^{13-14}\\ h^{-1}M\\_\\odot$, establishing a robust link between powerful AGN jets and rich cluster environments. Our results demonstrate that halo mass is important for determining the power of radio jets, but suggest that there is no minimum dark matter halo mass or BH mass required for the triggering of jets. The observed correlation suggests that BH spin is likely to play a minor role in jet production; instead, the key driver could be the presence of a strong magnetic flux.\n\n", "2601.20530": "2026-01-28, **Pathology of the Unified Dark Sectors in Modified General Relativity**, Mohsen Khodadi et.al., [2601.20530v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20530v1)\n\n This paper presents a comprehensive stability analysis of the black hole solution within Modified General Relativity (MGR), a theory proposing a unified geometric description of dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR).\n\n", "2601.20151": "2026-01-28, **Optimising Re-entrant Cavity Designs for Low Mass Axion Haloscopes**, Raj Aryan Singh et.al., [2601.20151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20151v1)\n\n Axion haloscopes provide a leading experimental approach to detecting QCD axion dark matter through resonant axion-photon conversion in microwave cavities. Extending haloscope sensitivity to low axion masses remains challenging due to the large resonator volumes required at sub-GHz frequencies. Re-entrant cavities offer a compact solution, but their performance depends strongly on geometric optimisation. We present a comprehensive finite-element study of re-entrant cavity haloscope designs operating in the 100 to 500 MHz range, comparing their performance using effective scan time as a figure of merit. Among the configurations studied, we identify a double attack geometry that achieves a roughly threefold improvement in effective scan time compared to a conventional single-rod re-entrant cavity. We further investigate practical implementation strategies, including a hybrid design employing one fixed rod and one tunable rod, which preserves a scan time gain while reducing mechanical complexity. These results demonstrate a pathway to enhanced low-mass axion haloscope sensitivity.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2601.21168": "2026-01-29, **Strontium-84 Enrichments in Presolar Grains Provide First Evidence of p-process Nucleosynthesis in Core-collapse Supernovae**, Ishita Pal et.al., [2601.21168v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21168v1)\n\n This study reports detection of rare p-process isotopes within presolar grains. Presolar grains are relic dust grains from dying stars. These microscopic dust particles are found in primitive solar system materials. Their distinct isotopic compositions record the nucleosynthetic processes in their parent stars and the Galactic chemical environment in which these stars formed. We studied presolar graphite grains of high-density type from the Murchison meteorite and found five grains with subgrains that show enrichments in 84Sr compared to the solar abundance.84Sr is the neutron-deficient isotope of strontium that can be produced in the deep oxygen-rich interior of high-mass stars that end their lives as core-collapse supernovae. The observed 84Sr excesses cannot be produced in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, the source of most high-density presolar graphites found in meteorites. High-density graphites with embedded 84Sr excesses are, instead, compatible with a core-collapse supernovae origin. The graphite subgrains condensed from carbon-rich materials in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae, where 84Sr was destroyed by neutron captures during hydrostatic evolution of the stars and their final explosion. Based on current theoretical stellar models, a few percent of contribution from the inner regions of core-collapse supernovae, which are enriched in p-process nuclides, to the outer carbon-rich regions is the most likely explanation for the observed enrichment of 84Sr in the subgrains of the high-density graphites. In this study, we present the first observational evidence that core-collapse supernovae produce and eject isotopes made by the p-process.\n\n", "2601.20972": "2026-01-28, **The Lambert $W$ equation of state in light of DESI BAO**, Vipin Chandra Dubey et.al., [2601.20972v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20972v1)\n\n We investigate the hypothesis that the evolution of the Universe can be described by a single dark fluid whose effective equation of state (EoS), $\u03c9\\_{\\rm{eff}}$, is a linear combination of a logarithmic term and a power law term, both involving the Lambert $W$ function. This particular form of EoS was first proposed by S. Saha and K. Bamba in 2019 and has two parameters, $\u03b8\\_1$ and $\u03b8\\_2$, which must be determined from observations. To this end, we place limits on these parameters by combining recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data -- including measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) -- with Type Ia supernova observations from the Pantheon+ compilation, along with direct determinations of the Hubble parameter. From this combined analysis, we obtain a best-fit value for the Hubble parameter, $H\\_0 = 67.4 \\pm 1.2~\\text{km\\,s}^{-1}\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, while current measurements of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch yield $r\\_d = 146\\pm 2.5$~Mpc.

The model exhibits noticeable deviations from the predictions of the concordance $\u039b$CDM model. Despite these differences, our results indicate that the model provides a coherent description of late-time cosmic evolution and the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe. Finally, we assess the observational viability of the model using information criteria, particularly the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and compare these results with those obtained for the $\u039b$CDM model, which serves as our reference.\n\n", "2601.20633": "2026-01-28, **Apparent Dark-Energy Evolution from Cosmic Inhomogeneities**, Yonadav Barry Ginat et.al., [2601.20633v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20633v1)\n\n A mildly inhomogeneous universe with a cosmological constant may look like it contains evolving dark energy. We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant.\n\n", "2601.20446": "2026-01-28, **Probing the Diversity of Type Ia Supernova Remnants in 3-D Hydrodynamic Simulations with X-ray Spectral Synthesis**, Yusei Fujimaru et.al., [2601.20446v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20446v1)\n\n Type Ia supernovae (SNe), thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in binary systems, are widely used as standard candles owing to the empirical width-luminosity relation of their light curves. Recent theoretical and observational studies indicate a diversity of progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms. In the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, the diversity in Fe-K$\u03b1$ centroid energies and line luminosities suggests variations in the underlying explosion mechanisms. X-ray spectra of SNRs, which trace shocked ejecta and the surrounding medium, are crucial diagnostics of progenitor systems and explosion physics. Thanks to recent advances in spectroscopy with XRISM, high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy enables 3-D diagnostics, including line-of-sight velocities. In this study, we perform 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs from six Type Ia explosion models: two each of pure deflagration, delayed detonation, and double detonation. Each model is evolved for 1000 years in a uniform medium, consistently accounting for non-equilibrium ionization. Our efficient numerical scheme enables systematic parameter surveys in full 3-D. From these models, we synthesize X-ray spectra with $\\sim$1 eV resolution, exceeding XRISM/Resolve's spectral resolution. This work presents the first calculation of X-ray spectra for Type Ia SNRs derived from 3-D hydrodynamic simulations that follow the evolution self-consistently from the SN phase into the SNR phase. Our results show inter-model diversity in the X-ray spectra. Asymmetric, red- and blueshifted line profiles arise from the 3-D ejecta distributions. These findings demonstrate that 3-D SNR modeling can reproduce the observed diversity of Type Ia SNRs and provide qualitative constraints on progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms.\n\n", "2601.20210": "2026-01-28, **Gamma-ray Emission from the S147 Region: Indication of Escaping Cosmic Rays Interacting with Molecular Clouds**, Huan Yang et.al., [2601.20210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20210v1)\n\n We present a detailed analysis of $\u03b3$-ray emission from the middle-aged supernova remnant (SNR) S147 (G180.0$-$1.7) using approximately 16.5 years of Fermi-LAT data. Spatially, a new extended $\u03b3$-ray component distinct from the emission associated with the H$\u03b1$ filaments of the SNR shell is identified. This new component exhibits a strong spatial correlation with dense molecular clouds (MCs) identified in CO emission at Local Standard of Rest velocities of $0$-$5\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. Spectrally, the cloud-associated emission implies an underlying cosmic-ray (CR) proton population described by a hard power law with an index of $\u0393\\approx 2.1$, compatible with the standard diffusive shock acceleration prediction. We interpret the $\u03b3$-ray emission in this region with a hadronic scenario involving two distinct CR populations: trapped CRs reaccelerated within the radiative SNR shell as proposed in previous work, and escaping CRs illuminating the nearby MCs. The derived CR proton intensity in the MC region significantly exceeds the local Galactic background measured by AMS-02, strongly suggesting that the cloud is illuminated by particles accelerated by S147. These findings provide observational evidence for CR escape during the earlier evolutionary phases of this middle-aged SNR and highlight S147 as a promising candidate for detection at TeV energies by LHAASO.\n\n"}}
