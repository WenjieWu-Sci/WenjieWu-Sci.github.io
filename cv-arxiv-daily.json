The rise in the energy threshold of air-shower measurements in IceTop due to accumulating snow emphasized the need for the next generation of IceCube surface detectors. For this purpose, the Surface Array Enhancement (SAE) is set to comprise elevated scintillator panels and radio antennas controlled by hybrid DAQ systems. The detectors of the SAE are also expected to extend to the planned IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array. An initial study with a prototype station is already conducted. We briefly review the SAE and the deployment as well as the calibration status of the upcoming stations of the planned array of 32 stations. The focus of this contribution is on the radio detection of extensive air showers. A preliminary estimation of the position of the shower maximum ($X\\_\\mathrm{max}$), that is sensitive to the primary mass, with data from the 3 antennas of the prototype station was carried out. An extension of the method from previous analyses is also briefly discussed.\n\n", "2506.18490": "2025-06-23, **Flash Ionization of the Early Universe by Pop III.1 Supermassive Stars**, Jonathan C.

The lightest among the Majorana fermions and neutral scalars can serve as dark matter candidates. We explore the parameter space, considering theoretical constraints (perturbativity, unitarity, vacuum stability) and experimental limits (lepton flavor violation, Higgs measurements, electroweak precision observables). Our analysis identifies regions where sizable Yukawa couplings naturally arise due to constructive interference in the scalar sector.

We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\\beta(z)$ shows a $\\sim 2\\sigma$ deviation from $\\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\\beta$ at $\\sim2\\sigma$.

By analyzing the spacetime geometry, we explore how key parameters -- the core radius and halo density of the dark matter, along with the string tension -- affect the geodesic motion of both massless and massive particles. Our results reveal that the combined influence of HDMH and CSs modifies the effective potentials for null and timelike geodesics, leading to distinct dynamical behavior compared to standard Schwarzschild geometry. We perform a perturbative analysis for scalar (spin-0), electromagnetic (spin-1), and Dirac (spin-1/2) fields, deriving the associated effective potentials and showing how both the dark halo and CSs alter field propagation and potential barriers. The shadow of the BH is studied in detail: we derive analytical expressions for photon sphere and shadow radii, finding that CSs tend to enlarge the shadow, while HDMH properties tend to shrink it. The combined effects of these parameters significantly influence the shadow's shape and size, producing potentially observable signatures. Our results establish that the SHDMHCS configuration yields distinct observational imprints detectable by present and forthcoming astrophysical instruments.

A comprehensive scan of the parameter space is performed, subject to the experimental constraints from the LHC SUSY searches, Planck 2018 relic density, and LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) direct detection limits.

Notably, the $\\mu < 0$ scenario yields a broader allowed parameter space, including for the first time sbottom-neutralino coannihilation solutions in GmSUGRA, which are absent for $\\mu > 0$. While the Higgs-pole and $Z$-pole regions for $\\mu > 0$ are largely excluded by the current LZ bounds, substantial viable regions remain for $\\mu < 0$.

A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits.

While a quartic potential with such coupling represents one of the simplest realizations compatible with cosmological observations, it generically receives important radiative corrections when the inflaton interacts with other fields, particularly those involved in the reheating process. In this work, we focus on radiative corrections arising from bosonic scalar couplings and study their impact on inflationary dynamics within the nonminimally coupled quartic potential framework. We demonstrate that bosonic corrections, unlike fermionic ones, yield predictions more compatible with the latest constraints from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6, especially when combined with Planck and BICEP/Keck data. We begin with a general model involving a gauge-singlet real scalar inflaton coupled to a complex scalar field, which could be the Standard Model Higgs or a GUT Higgs. As a concrete realization, we also investigate the case where the inflaton serves as a dark matter candidate through a Higgs portal interaction while highlighting its potential to generate observable levels of primordial gravitational waves. Notably, the nonminimally coupled inflation model studied here is field-theoretically equivalent to the Starobinsky model, and the inclusion of quantum corrections from scalar fields leads to characteristic imprints in the $(n\\_s, r)$ plane, allowing for refined constraints on scalar couplings from current and future observations.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2506.18681": "2025-06-23, **TeV spectral bump of cosmic-ray protons and helium nuclei: the role of nearby supernova remnants**, Sourav Bhadra et.al., [2506.18681v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18681v1)\n\n The existence of nearby discrete cosmic-ray sources can lead to many interesting effects on the observed properties of cosmic rays. Recent measurements of cosmic rays with the CALET and the DAMPE experiments have revealed a bump-like new feature in the proton and helium spectra in the energy range of ~ (1-100) TeV/nucleon. The origin of the feature is not clearly understood. In this paper, considering an improved and more detailed analysis than previous works, and using an updated age and distance estimates of nearby supernova remnants along with an energy-dependent escape process for cosmic rays from the remnants, we show that the spectral bump can be explained by the contribution of cosmic rays from the nearby supernova remnants, in particular, the Vela remnant. We also show that the contribution from the nearby remnants agrees well with the observed spectra of the heavier cosmic-ray elements from carbon to iron as well as with the measured all-particle cosmic-ray spectrum beyond the knee region when combined with a background flux of cosmic rays originating from distant supernova remnants.\n\n", "2506.18518": "2025-06-23, **The undetectable fraction of core-collapse supernovae in luminous infrared galaxies**, I.

This fraction of undetected CCSNe, unaccounted for by typical extinction corrections, is an important factor in determining CCSN rates, in particular at redshifts $z \\gtrsim 1$, where LIRGs dominate the cosmic star formation. Our aim is to derive a robust estimate for the undetected fraction of CCSNe in LIRGs in the local Universe. Our study is based on the K-band multi-epoch SUNBIRD survey data set of a sample of eight LIRGs using the Gemini-North Telescope with the ALTAIR/NIRI laser guide star adaptive optics system. We used simulated SNe and a standard image subtraction method to determine limiting detection magnitudes for the data set. Subsequently, we used a Monte Carlo method to combine the limiting magnitudes with the survey cadence, and an adopted distribution of CCSN subtypes and their light curve evolution to determine SN detection probabilities. Lastly, we combined these probabilities with the intrinsic CCSN rates of the sample galaxies estimated based on their detailed radiative transfer modeling to derive the fraction of undetectable CCSNe in local LIRGs.

Finsler geometry generalizes Riemannian geometry by allowing the metric tensor to depend on position and an additional internal degree of freedom, typically represented by a vector field at each point of the spacetime manifold. We explore whether Finsler-type geometries can describe gravitational interaction and cosmological dynamics. In particular, we examine the Barthel connection and $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ geometries, where $\\alpha$ is a Riemannian metric and $\\beta$ is a one-form. For a specific construction of $\\beta$, the Barthel connection coincides with the Levi-Civita connection of the associated Riemann metric.

After presenting the mathematical foundations of Finslerian-type modified gravity theories, we derive generalized Friedmann equations in these geometries assuming a Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker type metric. We also present the matter-energy balance equations, interpreting them from the perspective of thermodynamics with particle creation.

The power-law spectra source SrcB is spatially coincident with a SNR radio shell. SrcC with a harder power-law photon spectrum is located outside of the radio shell structure. All of them are spatially coincident with a dense molecular cloud (MC) in the velocity range of 35 - 54 km s$^{-1}$. In this scenario, SrcB can be interpreted as the GeV counterpart of the SNR, and its $\\gamma$-ray emission originates from the shock-cloud interaction.

This study presents a comprehensive, model-independent, and data-driven test of the CDDR using a combination of cosmological observations, including Supernovae (SN), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Hubble parameter ($H(z)$) measurements. We employ both Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and a novel Compressed Point (CPI) method for reconstructing the CDDR, alongside four distinct parameterizations for potential deviations. Nuisance parameters, such as the supernova absolute magnitude and BAO scale, are rigorously handled via both joint numerical fitting (Method I) and analytic marginalization (Method II). Our findings reveal that while direct reconstruction of the CDDR exhibits no significant deviation (less than 1-$\\sigma$) under specific prior assumptions, a notable departure emerges when the SH0ES prior is incorporated, suggesting a systematic influence from the Hubble constant tension. Independently, our parameterized analysis corroborates the consistency of CDDR and confirms the equivalence of the two constraint methodologies. We also find no significant evidence for cosmic opacity. A comparative assessment of reconstruction techniques indicates that GPR generally yields higher precision. These results emphasize the critical role of prior choices and statistical methods in CDDR analyses, providing valuable insights into fundamental cosmological principles and the ongoing Hubble tension.\n\n"}}
