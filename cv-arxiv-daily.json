Moreover, the proper field-theory description of neutrinos, whether they are Majorana or Dirac type, must be linked to such a mechanism. The present work addresses the calculation, estimation, and analysis of one-loop contributions from virtual Majorana neutrinos, light and heavy as well, to the neutral gauge boson coupling $ZZZ$, which participates in $Z$-boson pair production from $e^+e^-$ collisions. This task is carried out in the framework defined by a seesaw variant in which light neutrinos remain massless at tree level, then becoming massive radiatively. The $ZZZ^*$ coupling, with $Z^*$ an off-shell $Z$ boson, is defined by two form factors, namely, $f\\_4$, characterizing CP-odd effects, and $f\\_5$, which is CP-even. Constraints from the Large Hadron Collider on both these quantities are currently ${\\cal O}(10^{-4})$. Our calculation yields CP-nonpreserving contributions to $ZZZ$, which are absent in the framework of the sole Standard Model. Our estimations show that the $f\\_4$ contribution might be as large as ${\\cal O}(10^{-7})$ for heavy-neutrino masses $\\sim1\\,{\\rm TeV}$. CP-even contributions $f\\_5$ are also generated, which are, in general, larger than their CP-odd counterparts.

We investigate the possibility that jets launched with a time delay of days to months, interact with a debris that may expand outwards. We discuss the effects of the time delay and expansion velocity on the outcomes of jet breakout and collimation. We find that a jet with an isotropic-equivalent luminosity of $\\lesssim 5 \\times 10^{45}\\,{\\rm erg/s}$ is likely to be choked for a delay time of $\\sim 3$ months. We also study the observational signatures of such delayed choked jets. The jet-debris interaction preceding the breakout would lead to particle acceleration and the resulting synchrotron emission can be detected by current and near-future radio, optical and X-ray telescopes, and the expanding jet-driven debris could explain late-time radio emission. We discuss high-energy neutrino production in delayed choked jets, and the time delay can significantly alleviate the difficulty of the hidden jet scenario in explaining neutrino coincidences.\n\n", "2309.02103": "2023-09-05, **Testing Lorentz invariance violation using cosmogenic neutrinos**, M.

Previous works assumed that the induced bulk viscosity correction to pressure, near beta equilibrium, is linear in deviations from the equilibrium charge fraction. We show that this is not always true for (some) realistic equations of state at densities between one and three times saturation density. This nonlinear nature of the perturbation around equilibrium motivates a far-from-beta-equilibrium description of bulk-viscous transport in neutron star mergers, which can be precisely achieved using a new Israel-Stewart formulation with resummed bulk and relaxation time transport coefficients. The computation of these transport coefficients depends on out-of-beta-equilibrium pressure corrections, which can be computed for a given equation of state. We calculate these coefficients for equations of state that satisfy the latest constraints from multi-messenger observations from LIGO/VIRGO and NICER. We show that varying the nuclear symmetry energy $J$ and its slope $L$ can significantly affect the transport coefficients and the nonlinear behavior of the out-of-equilibrium pressure corrections.

Besides the well-known solutions to the naturalness problem (Supersymmetry, Conformal symmetry, Compositeness, etc), models that include heavy particles with feeble couplings to the Standard Model (SM) can be considered natural, since the corrections to the Higgs mass remains of the order of the electroweak (EW) scale. This solution can be used for model building too, with realizations that include the see-saw mechanism for neutrino masses and FIMP dark matter models, but it also holds for generic sectors that have Planck-suppressed couplings with the SM. One can also incorporate this solution within the SMEFT framework; the corresponding higher-dimensional operators induce small corrections to both the Higgs mass and its self-coupling, a prediction that can be tested at a future Higgs factory.

We use data from the Via Lactea II (VL-II) N-body cosmological simulation, which resolves subhaloes down to $\\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ solar masses and it is thus ideal for this purpose. First, we characterize the abundance, distribution and structural properties of the VL-II subhalo population in terms of both subhalo masses and maximum circular velocities. Then, we repopulate the original simulation with millions of subhaloes of masses down to about five orders of magnitude below the minimum VL-II subhalo mass (more than one order of magnitude in velocities). We compute subhalo DM annihilation astrophysical \"J-factors\" and angular sizes for the entire subhalo population, by placing the Earth at a random position but at the right galactocentric distance in the simulation. Thousands of these realizations are generated in order to obtain statistically meaningful results. We find that some nearby low-mass Galactic subhaloes, not massive enough to retain stars or gas, may indeed yield DM annihilation fluxes comparable to those expected from other, more massive and acknowledgeable DM targets like dwarf satellite galaxies. Typical angular sizes are of the order of the degree, thus subhaloes potentially appearing as extended sources in gamma-ray telescopes, depending on instrument angular resolution and sensitivity.

In the early universe, this scenario led to a rapid increase in the energy density of dark radiation; in the late universe, the evolution of axion dark matter is similar to that of cold dark matter, with this scenario resembling decaying dark matter and serving to ease the large-scale structure tension. We employ cosmological observational data, including cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), supernova data (SNIa), $H\\_0$ measurement from SH0ES, and $S\\_8$ from the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 (DES), to study and analyze this model.

For this study, we made use of neural networks, for the first time, to construct a data-driven non-parametric model of ICM temperature profiles. A new deconvolution algorithm was then introduced to uncover the true (3D) temperature profiles from the observed projected (2D) temperature profiles. An auto-encoder-inspired neural network was first trained by learning a non-linear interpolatory scheme to build the underlying model of 3D temperature profiles in the radial range of [0.02-2] R$\\_{500}$, using a sparse set of hydrodynamical simulations from the THREE HUNDRED PROJECT. A deconvolution algorithm using a learning-based regularisation scheme was then developed. The model was tested using high and low resolution input temperature profiles, such as those expected from simulations and observations, respectively. We find that the proposed deconvolution and deprojection algorithm is robust with respect to the quality of the data, the morphology of the cluster, and the deprojection scheme used. The algorithm can recover unbiased 3D radial temperature profiles with a precision of around 5\\% over most of the fitting range. We apply the method to the first sample of temperature profiles obtained with XMM{\\it -Newton} for the CHEX-MATE project and compared it to parametric deprojection and deconvolution techniques.

Since such setups aim at the detection of relativistic and beyond-Standard-Model physics, the analysis of interferometric phases as well as of atomic diffraction must be performed to this precision and including these effects. In contrast, most treatments focused on idealized diffraction so far. Here, we study single-photon transitions, both magnetically-induced and direct ones, in gravity and Standard-Model extensions modeling dark matter as well as Einstein-equivalence-principle violations. We take into account relativistic effects like the coupling of internal to center-of-mass degrees of freedom, induced by the mass defect, as well as the gravitational redshift of the diffracting light pulse.

This indicates that the assumptions underlying the analytic result, namely, spherical symmetry, isotropy, and a static potential, are sufficiently accurate to govern the coarse properties of the velocity distribution in the inner regions of the halo.

We investigate the role of baryonic cooling and stellar feedback, modeled from individual stars, in shaping haloes, and of environmental effects as accretion of dark matter along cosmic filaments and mergers.

We take the case where the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaks during inflation, resulting in a $N\\_{\\rm DW}=1$ string-wall network that re-enters horizon sufficiently late. Therefore, closed axion domain walls naturally arising in the network are sufficiently large to collapse into PBHs. Our numerical simulation shows that $0.8\\%$ of the total wall area is in the form of closed walls. Notably, this fraction is independent of any axion parameters, as its determination is firmly grounded in the principles of percolation theory. In addition, the relic abundance of dark matter is accounted for by free axions from the collapse of open walls bounded by strings. This framework yields a calculated PBH fraction of dark matter as 0.0256. The PBHs uniformly share the same mass, which spans from about $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-1}$ solar masses, corresponding to the classical QCD axion mass window $10^{-5}-10^{-2}$ eV and the re-entering horizon temperature $300-1$ MeV.

In an attempt to understand the featureless structure of these galaxies we constructed several $N$-body models with an initially reduced content of dark matter. We concluded that, in addition to the low mass of the dark halo, the decisive factor that leads to a barless disc is the start from an initially unstable state. An isolated dynamically cold disc (with the Toomre parameter $Q < 0.5$) settled into rotational equilibrium passes trough the short stage of violent instability with fragmentation and formation of stellar clumps. After that, it evolves passively and ends up with a featureless structure.

Furthermore, by comparing the hydro simulations with higher resolution dark matter only simulations of the same objects and taking the same limit in subhalo mass we find significantly more cuspy galaxy density profiles towards the center of the clusters, where the low mass substructures would tend to concentrate.

Our model incorporates effective interactions constrained by SU(3) relations and considers baryonic degrees of freedom. By constraining the model with astrophysical data and nuclear matter properties, we find a first-order phase transition within realistic values of the slope parameter L. The inclusion of the baryon octet and negative parity partners, along with a chiral-invariant mass $m\\_{0}$, allows for a non-massless chiral symmetric phase. Through exploration of parameter space, we identify parameter sets satisfying mass and radius constraints without requiring a partonic phase. The appearance of the parity partner of the nucleon, the N(1535) resonance, suppresses strangeness, pushing hyperonization to higher densities. We observe a mild first-order phase transition to the chirally restored phase, governed by $m\\_{0}$. Our calculations of surface tension highlight its strong dependence on $m\\_{0}$. The existence of mixed phases is ruled out since they become energetically too costly. We compare stars with metastable and stable cores using both branches of the equation of state.

This allowed us to assess whether these interactions can be potential acceleration sites of ultra high-energy cosmic rays, or at least of their seeds. For that, we estimated the cosmic ray luminosity for different galaxy types, and compared the injection rate of cosmic ray seeds into the jet with that due to galactic cosmic ray entrainment. Since the supernova is fueled for a long time by the luminosity of the jet, the energy of a supernova-jet interaction can be several orders of magnitude greater than that of an isolated supernova. Thus, despite the low rate of supernovae expected to occur in the jet, they could still provide more seeds for accelerating ultra high-energy particles than cosmic ray entrainment from the host galaxy. Moreover, these interactions can create sufficiently efficient accelerators to be a source of cosmic rays with energies $\\gtrsim 10$~EeV. Supernova-jet interactions can contribute significantly to the production of ultra high-energy cosmic rays, either directly by accelerating these particles themselves or indirectly by providing pre-accelerated seeds.\n\n", "2309.02170": "2023-09-05, **Cosmological Constraints on Thermal Friction of Axion Dark Matter**, Gang Liu et.al., [2309.02170v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02170v1)\n\n In this paper, we investigate the process in which axion dark matter undergoes thermal friction, resulting in energy injection into dark radiation, with the aim of mitigating the Hubble tension and large-scale structure tension. In the early universe, this scenario led to a rapid increase in the energy density of dark radiation; in the late universe, the evolution of axion dark matter is similar to that of cold dark matter, with this scenario resembling decaying dark matter and serving to ease the large-scale structure tension. We employ cosmological observational data, including cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), supernova data (SNIa), $H\\_0$ measurement from SH0ES, and $S\\_8$ from the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 (DES), to study and analyze this model. Our results indicate that the thermal friction model offers partial alleviation of the large-scale structure tension, while its contribution on alleviating Hubble tension can be ignored.

Assuming that a black hole is formed in a short timescale after the onset of the stellar collapse, the new simulations are started from initial data of a spinning black hole and infalling matter that self-consistently satisfy the constraint equations of general relativity. It is found that with a reasonable size of the viscous parameter, the supernova-like explosion is driven by the viscous heating effect in the torus around the black hole irrespective of the progenitor mass. The typical explosion energy and ejecta mass for the large-mass cases ($M\\_\\mathrm{ZAMS}=35$ and $45M\\_\\odot$) are $\\sim 10^{52}$ erg and $\\sim 5M\\_\\odot$, respectively, with $^{56}$Ni mass larger than $0.15M\\_\\odot$.

This indicates that rotating stellar collapses of massive stars to a black hole surrounded by a massive torus can be a central engine for high-energy supernovae. By artificially varying the angular velocity of the initial data, we explore the dependence of the explosion energy and ejecta mass on the initial angular momentum and find that the large explosion energy $\\sim 10^{52}$ erg and large $^{56}$Ni mass $\\geq 0.15M\\_\\odot$ are possible only when a large-mass compact torus with mass $\\gtrsim 1M\\_\\odot$ is formed.\n\n", "2309.02030": "2023-09-05, **Matched filtering for gravitational wave detection without template bank driven by deep learning template prediction model bank**, CunLiang Ma et.al., [2309.02030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02030v1)\n\n The existing matched filtering method for gravitational wave (GW) search relies on a template bank. The computational efficiency of this method scales with the size of the templates within the bank. Higher-order modes and eccentricity will play an important role when third-generation detectors operate in the future. In this case, traditional GW search methods will hit computational limits. To speed up the computational efficiency of GW search, we propose the utilization of a deep learning (DL) model bank as a substitute for the template bank. This model bank predicts the latent templates embedded in the strain data. Combining an envelope extraction network and an astrophysical origin discrimination network, we realize a novel GW search framework. The framework can predict the GW signal's matched filtering signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Unlike the end-to-end DL-based GW search method, our statistical SNR holds greater physical interpretability than the $p\\_{score}$ metric. Moreover, the intermediate results generated by our approach, including the predicted template, offer valuable assistance in subsequent GW data processing tasks such as parameter estimation and source localization. Compared to the traditional matched filtering method, the proposed method can realize real-time analysis.

The recent explosion of SN 2023ixf in a very nearby galaxy, Messier 101, provides a rare opportunity to explore this longstanding issue. With the timely high-cadence flash spectra taken within 1-5 days after the explosion, we can put stringent constraints on the properties of the surrounding circumstellar material around this supernova. Based on the rapid fading of the narrow emission lines and luminosity/profile of $\\rm H\\alpha$ emission at very early times, we estimate that the progenitor of SN 2023ixf lost material at a mass-loss rate $\\dot{\\rm M} \\approx 6 \\times 10^{-4}\\, \\rm M\\_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}$ over the last 2-3 years before explosion.

We found an average polarization degree of $22.4\\pm 3.5\\%$ and an average polarization angle of $-45.4\\pm 4.5^\\circ$ (measured on the plane of the sky from north to east). The X-ray polarization angle distribution reveals that the magnetic fields immediately behind the shock in the northeastern shell of SN 1006 are nearly parallel to the shock normal or radially distributed, similar to that in the radio observations, and consistent with the quasi-parallel CR acceleration scenario. The X-ray emission is marginally more polarized than that in the radio band. The X-ray polarization degree of SN 1006 is much larger than that in Cas A and Tycho, together with the relatively tenuous and smooth ambient medium of the remnant, favoring that CR-induced instabilities set the turbulence in SN 1006 and CR acceleration is environment-dependent.\n\n", "2309.01802": "2023-09-04, **Sensitivity of Simulations of Double Detonation Type Ia Supernova to Integration Methodology**, Michael Zingale et.al., [2309.01802v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01802v1)\n\n We study the coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions in simulations of the double detonation model for Type Ia supernovae. When assessing the convergence of simulations, the focus is usually on spatial resolution; however, the method of coupling the physics together as well as the tolerances used in integrating a reaction network also play an important role. In this paper, we explore how the choices made in both coupling and integrating the reaction portion of a simulation (operator / Strang splitting vs.\\ the simplified spectral deferred corrections method we introduced previously) influences the accuracy, efficiency, and the nucleosynthesis of simulations of double detonations.

We obtained narrow-band images in the filters H$\\alpha$ + [NII], H$\\beta$, [OIII], [SII] that revealed faint optical emission in the southern region of the SNR consisting of two filaments elongated in the east-west direction aligned with the X-ray emitting region of the remnant. The filaments were seen in H$\\alpha$ + [NII], [OIII] images and marginally in the [SII] images, with a non-detection in H$\\beta$. Long-slit spectroscopy of three regions along one filament revealed large ratios of [SII] / H$\\alpha$ = (1.6-2.5), consistent with that expected for a shock-heated SNR. The [SII] doublet ratio observed in two of the regions implies an upper limit for the electron density of the gas, with estimates falling below 400 cm$^{-3}$ and 600 cm$^{-3}$ in the respective areas.

To probe the asymmetries and the evolution of the SNR, we track the ejecta dynamics using new methods applied to the deep X-ray observations available in the Chandra space telescope archive. For the line of sight velocity measurement Vz, we use the Doppler effect focused on the bright Si line in the 1.6-2.1 keV band. Using the component separation tool General Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA), we successfully disentangle the red and blueshifted Si ejecta emission. This allows us to reconstruct a map of the peak energy of the Si line with a total coverage of the SNR at a 2'' resolution and a proxy of the velocity in the line of sight. For the proper motions in the plane of the sky Vxy, we develop a new method, named Poisson Optical Flow, to measure the displacement of 2D features between the observations of 2003 and 2009. The result is a field of 1700 velocity vectors covering the entire SNR. These exhaustive 3D velocity measurements reveal the complex and patchy dynamics of the SNR. At the large-scale, an asymmetry with the North being dominantly blueshifted and the South redshifted is observed. The proper motion vector field Vxy highlights different dynamics between the East and the West parts of the SNR. The eastern velocity field is more disturbed by external inhomogeneities and the South-East ejecta knot. In particular, a slow-down is observed in the North-East which could be due to the interaction with higher densities as seen in other wavelengths. The vector field is also used to backtrace the center of the explosion which is then compared with potential stellar progenitors distances from the latest Gaia DR3, leaving only stars B and E as possible candidates.\n\n", "2309.01533": "2023-09-04, **Light clusters in the liquid proto-neutron star inner crust**, H.

Particular care is also devoted to the calculation of the rearrangement term, thus ensuring thermodynamic consistency. We compare the results of the multi-component plasma calculations with those obtained within a one-component (single-nucleus) approach, showing that important differences arise between the predictions of the two treatments.

LAMOST J1645+4357 has a remarkable abundance set, highlighted by these features: (1) Nitrogen is significantly enhanced ([N/Fe]=+1.4) and the total abundance of C and N is also very high ([(C+N)/Fe]=+0.9); (2) alpha-elements are over-abundant with respect to iron as generally found in very metal-poor stars; (3) Ti, Sc, Co and Zn are significantly deficient; (4) Cr and Mn are enhanced compared to most of very metal-poor stars; (5) Sr and Ba are deficient and the Sr/Ba ratio ([Sr/Ba]=-1.0) is significantly lower than the value expected for the r-process. The overall abundance pattern of this object from C to Zn is well reproduced by a faint supernova model assuming spherical explosion, except for the excess of Cr and Mn which requires enhancement of incomplete Si burning or small contributions of a type Ia supernova or a pair-instability supernova.

Based on the pre-explosion images of Hubble Space Telescope (\\textit{HST}) and \\textit{Spitzer} Space Telescope, we place tight constraints on the progenitor candidate of type IIP SN 2023ixf in Messier 101. Fitting of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of its progenitor with dusty stellar spectral models results in an estimation of the effective temperature as 3090 K, making it the coolest SN progenitor ever discovered.

The derived mass loss rate (6-9$\\times10^{-6}$ M$\\_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is much lower than that inferred from the flash spectroscopy of the SN, suggesting that the progenitor experienced a sudden increase in mass loss when approaching the final explosion. In the mid-infrared color diagram, the progenitor star is found to show a significant deviation from the range of regular RSGs, but is close to some extreme RSGs and super asymptotic giant branch (sAGB) stars.

Whether this is due to hidden systematics or it points towards new physics is still under debate, however, it is crucial to study as many probes as possible to cross-check the results with independent methods and provide additional pieces of information to the cosmological puzzle. In this work, by combining several late-Universe probes sampling the redshift range $0<z<10$, namely, Type Ia SuperNovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Chronometers and Gamma-Ray Bursts, we aim to derive cosmological constraints independently of local or early-Universe anchors. To test the standard cosmological model and its various extensions, considering an evolving Dark Energy Equation of State and the curvature as a free parameter, we analyse each probe individually and all their possible permutations.
