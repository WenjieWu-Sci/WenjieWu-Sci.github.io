At about 10 $\u03bc$s after the big bang, the primordial matter made up of quarks and gluons plus leptons, photons and neutrinos, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), became cool enough to create, in a phase transition, the protons and neutrons of ordinary matter, along with other strongly interacting unstable hadrons. This phase transition was predicted within the framework of QCD and has been studied in accelerator laboratories world-wide since about 40 years. This review will explore recent breakthroughs in the study of the QCD phase diagram. We will highlight measurements of particle production and fluctuations, and compare them to theoretical predictions.

In chapter 2, the SuSAM* model is improved by redefining the single nucleon hadronic tensor, averaging it over a Fermi distribution instead of using the previous extrapolation from the relativistic Fermi gas. This formulation removes the inconsistency associated with negative contributions in kinematics far from the QE peak. The new definition allows extending the SuSAM* formalism to include MEC, which is the focus of chapter 3. In chapter 3, a scaling analysis of 12C data is performed incorporating MEC explicitly at the single nucleon level, leading to a new phenomenological scaling function. Using this model, the effect of MEC on EM responses is studied and compared with the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) and the relativistic mean field (RMF) models. Chapter 4 presents a detailed analysis of the interference between 1b2b in the RT. It is shown that this interference is always negative within the independent-particle approximation. Chapter 5 extends the study of MEC to the CCQE neutrino scattering within the RFG, RMF, and SuSAM* frameworks. It is found that OB-MEC interference reduces both the RT and the neutrino cross section. Chapter 6 addresses SRC in the wave function of a nucleon pair in nuclear matter. The BG equation is solved using the NN potential developed by the Granada group, allowing for the calculation of high-momentum components. Finally, chapter 7 combined the effect of MEC and SRC, which extends the FG by including the high-momentum components of nucleon pairs affected by MEC.

Two of those resolutions are also run with a weaker central magnetic field of $\\mathord{\\approx}10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{G}$ . The shock revival time for all models is largely independent of resolution and initial magnetic field strength, but we find higher explosion energies when the initial magnetism is stronger and at higher resolutions. We find that models with strong magnetic fields have lower neutrino luminosity and energies, due to a proto-neutron star (PNS) that is deformed by the strong magnetic fields. At higher resolutions, magnetic fields are amplified more efficiently in the gain region and in the PNS via the small-scale dynamo. Although the strong magnetic fields do not directly drive the explosion, they have a subsidiary impact on the explosion mechanism and compensate for the reduced neutrino heating. Stronger magnetic energies in the PNS also affect energy and angular momentum redistribution, leading to more extended and vigorous PNS convection zones at higher resolutions.\n\n", "2601.18237": "2026-01-26, **Revisiting $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion in $R$-parity violating SUSY**, Yu-Qi Xiao et.al., [2601.18237v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18237v1)\n\n The $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion process is one of the most powerful ways to test lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) interactions involving charged leptons. The standard model with massive neutrinos predicts an extremely low rate for $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion, making this process an excellent probe for testing LFV arising from new physics. Among many theoretical models that can induce LFV, the Supersymmetric model with R-parity violating interactions is one of the most studied for $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion. In this work, we revisit trilinear R-parity violating interactions for $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion, considering renormalization group (RG) running effects from high to low energy scales. The $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion, $\u03bc\\to e \u03b3$, and $\u03bc\\to eee$ experimental data are compared to give upper limits on the relevant 15 combinations of the trilinear $\u03bb^{\\prime}$ couplings and 6 combinations of the $\u03bb$ couplings, certain of which are underexplored in previous studies.

Invisible decays of heavy quarkonia are particularly promising for probing light dark matter, attracting broad interest due to their unique sensitivity. Experiments searching for radiative invisible decays of the $J/\u03c8$ have steadily improved upper limits, and upcoming facilities will push sensitivity further -- making the precise determination and subtraction of the neutrino background indispensable.

Conventional coincidence-based trigger logic implicitly assumes continuous sensor availability and therefore suffers systematic efficiency loss when channels become temporarily non-live. This work presents the design of a liveness-aware trigger architecture targeting low-latency FPGA deployment in distributed optical arrays. We introduce a recursive Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) update law implemented as a fully synthesizable pipeline that constructs a continuity-preserving effective observable at each sensor node. Rather than collapsing during non-liveness intervals, the observable decays smoothly while retaining phase and amplitude information relevant for network-level coherence estimation. By explicitly separating continuous measurement construction from discrete trigger decision logic, the proposed architecture enables graceful degradation under partial channel non-liveness. Performance is evaluated using a hybrid validation framework that combines representative event topologies derived from IceCube Open Data with a hardware-accurate signal and noise model spanning a wide dynamic range. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed trigger sustains high event recovery efficiency in regimes of elevated deadtime probability, where conventional coincidence logic degrades substantially. Furthermore, the continuity-preserving observable yields up to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in effective signal-to-noise ratio, enabling robust detection under strong saturation and non-ideal operating conditions. This method provides a robust foundation for next-generation firmware-level trigger strategies in large-scale, noise-dominated detector systems.\n\n", "2601.18051": "2026-01-26, **Neutrino opacities in magnetic fields for binary neutron star merger simulations**, Mia Kumamoto et.al., [2601.18051v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18051v1)\n\n Neutrino interactions play a central role in transport and flavor evolution in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers.

Using N-body simulations, we follow the tidal stripping and orbital evolution of satellite galaxies as they are accreted into a live cluster halo, systematically varying satellite-to-host mass ratio and orbital circularity. We measure the specific orbital energy and angular momentum of stripped stellar and DM material, finding that the stripped stars consistently occupy lower-energy and lower-angular momentum regions of phase-space than the stripped DM. The magnitude of this difference increases strongly towards more equal satellite--to--host mass ratios, while the dependence on orbital circularity is weak. We construct a predictive model for the phase-space properties of stripped stars and DM from a whole infalling satellite population and find that the resulting phase-space difference between the components are driven primarily by the characteristic mass of the infalling satellite stellar mass function. We find that the ICL is always more centrally concentrated than the DM. The magnitude of this offset depends on the characteristic mass and increases towards higher characteristic masses. Comparisons with four independent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that, once the infalling satellite stellar mass function is matched, the model reproduces the radial stellar-to-DM density profile offsets to better than the inter-simulation scatter. This demonstrates that the radial relationship between the ICL and the DM distribution is largely governed by satellite demographics. With adequate constraints on the infalling satellite population, ICL density profiles can therefore be used as informative tracers of the underlying radial DM distribution in clusters.\n\n", "2601.18652": "2026-01-26, **Impact of Rastall gravity on hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters**, M.

The hydrostatic mass and the mass obtained from gravitational lensing measurements generally differ, a discrepancy known as the hydrostatic mass bias. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within the framework of Rastall gravity and investigate its implications under two scenarios: (i) the absence of dark matter and (ii) the existence of dark matter. In the first scenario, Rastall gravity effectively reduces the hydrostatic mass, bringing it closer to the observed baryonic mass. The best linear fit yields a slope $\\mathbf{M}=1.07\\pm0.11$, indicating a near one-to-one correspondence between the two masses. In the second scenario, Rastall gravity helps to alleviate the hydrostatic mass bias. The linear fit between the Rastall hydrostatic mass and the observed lensing mass results in a best-fit slope $\\mathbf{M}=1.01\\pm0.16$, which is very close to unity.

While the standard Cold DM (CDM) model successfully explains observations on most astrophysical scales, DM particles have not yet been detected, leaving room for a plethora of different models. In order to identify their observable signatures, we use the AIDA-TNG cosmological simulation suite to predict the distributions of gas and neutral hydrogen (HI) in the CDM, Self-Interacting DM (SIDM), velocity-dependent SIDM (vSIDM), and Warm DM (WDM) models.   We find that the DM models investigated have very limited impact on the median gas and HI profile of haloes. In particular, for the most massive haloes ($M\\_{\\rm vir}\\sim10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{M}\\_\\odot$), we find that DM self-interactions can shallow the central potential and thereby enhance gas cooling. We find that, in all models, the halo-to-halo variation in the HI profiles is explained by AGN feedback, and that the specific characteristics of DM model is largely subdominant. Nevertheless, we detect some systematic difference in the case of SIDM, with more HI surviving close to the centre with respect to other models. We provide fitting functions for the gas and HI profiles.   We investigate the galaxy-Ly$\u03b1$ cross-correlation function (\\galacc) for different halo masses, redshift and observation strategies.

Finally, by comparison the results of the rotating Cardoso black hole with that of Kerr black hole in the absence of dark matter, we find that the presence of dark matter can not significantly affect the disk properties and thus for astrophysical black holes with large spin parameter, the distinction of rotating Cardoso black holes becomes more difficult than the Kerr black hole.\n\n", "2601.18079": "2026-01-26, **Vanishing Compactness Gap and Fermionic Compact Dark Matter in Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz Gravity**, Edwin J.

We compare the full EFT to several other models: a version neglecting the velocity-shear term, the non-linear alignment model (NLA), and to a reduced EFT assuming co-evolution relations that follow from the assumption that alignment is linear in Lagrangian space. The first two models yield biased constraints on the alignment amplitude, but the reduced EFT performs remarkably well, achieving a low reduced chi-squared and minimal bias. We examine the redshift and mass dependence of the higher-order bias parameters, finding that the linear Lagrangian bias assumption is approximately satisfied across the explored halo mass and redshift ranges for both galaxies and haloes, suggesting that the galaxies broadly follow the alignment properties of their host haloes.

These examples span both low- and high-dimensional models, allowing us to illustrate the advantages of global optimization. In both cases, XFit produces solutions that are consistent with or improve upon those found with traditional methods, while also revealing alternative fits or degenerate solutions within statistically acceptable confidence levels.
