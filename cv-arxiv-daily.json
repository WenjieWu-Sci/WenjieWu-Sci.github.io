Impulsive solar flare observations not only permit direct measurements of light curves, spectral content, and polarization on time scales significantly shorter than most extant dedicated solar observatories, but also offer an extremely useful above-surface calibration source, with pointing precision of order tens of arc-minutes. Using the early RNO-G data from 2022-2023, observed flare characteristics are compared to well-established solar observatories. Also, a number of individual flares are used to highlight angular reconstruction and calibration methods. RNO-G observes signal excesses during solar flares reported by the solar-observing Callisto network and in coincidence with about 60% of the brightest excesses recorded by the SWAVES satellite, when the Sun is above the horizon for RNO-G. In these observed flares, there is significant impulsivity in the time-domain.

However, recent experiments on neutrino oscillation have revealed that the majority of neutrino parameters indeed indicate their significant mass. In response, scientists are increasingly incorporating discrete symmetries alongside continuous ones for better justification of observed patterns of neutrino mixing.

While thermal relic of such self-interacting DM (SIDM) remains under-abundant due to efficient annihilation into light mediators, a non-zero asymmetry in dark sector can lead to survival of the required DM in the universe. The existence of a light mediator leads to the required self-interactions of DM at small scales while keeping DM properties similar to CDM at large scales. It also ensures that the symmetric DM component annihilates away, leaving the asymmetric part, in the spirit of cogenesis. The particle physics implementation is done in canonical seesaw models of light neutrino mass, connecting it to the origin of DM and BAU. In particular, we consider type-I and type-III seesaw origin of neutrino mass for simplicity and minimality of the field content. We show that the desired self-interactions and relic of DM together with BAU while satisfying relevant constraints lead to strict limits on DM mass $\\mathcal{O}(\\rm GeV) \\lesssim M\\_{\\rm DM} \\lesssim460 $ GeV.

BHNS mergers involve much of the same physics as binary neutron star mergers: strong gravity, nuclear density matter, neutrino radiation, and magnetic turbulence. They also share with binary neutron star systems the potential for bright electromagnetic signals, especially gamma ray bursts and kilonovae, and the potential to be significant sources of r-process elements. However, BHNS binaries are more asymmetric, and their mergers produce different amounts and arrangements of the various post-merger material components (e.g. disk and dynamical ejecta), together with a more massive black hole; these differences can have interesting consequences. In this chapter, we review the modeling of BHNS mergers and post-merger evolution in numerical relativistic hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics.

Recent strong-lensing analyses of dark matter structure rely on simulation-based inference (SBI). Modern SBI methods, which leverage neural networks as density estimators, have shown promise in extracting the halo-population signal. However, it is unclear whether the constraining power of these models has been limited by the methodology or the information content of the data. In this study, we introduce an accelerator-optimized simulation pipeline that can generate lens images with realistic subhalo populations in a matter of milliseconds. Leveraging this simulator, we identify the main methodological limitation of our fiducial SBI analysis: training set size. We then adopt a sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) approach, allowing us to iteratively refine the distribution of simulated training images to better align with the observed data. Using only one-fifth as many mock Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, SNPE matches the constraints on the low-mass halo population produced by our best non-sequential model. Our experiments suggest that an over three order-of-magnitude increase in training set size and GPU hours would be required to achieve an equivalent result without sequential methods. While the full potential of the existing strong lens sample remains to be explored, the notable improvement in constraining power enabled by our sequential approach highlights that the current constraints are limited primarily by methodology and not the data itself. Moreover, our results emphasize the need to treat training set generation and model optimization as interconnected stages of any cosmological analysis using simulation-based inference techniques.\n\n", "2404.13970": "2024-04-22, **DALI sensitivity to streaming axion dark matter**, Javier De Miguel et.al., [2404.13970v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13970v1)\n\n Dark matter substructures emerge naturally in a scenario in which the axion angular field acquires propagating degrees of freedom in a post-inflationary Universe.

Using large enough prior ranges for the present-day equation of state of dark energy $\\omega\\_0$ and amplitude of dark energy evolution $\\omega\\_a$, we obtain the complete $1\\,\\sigma$ and $2\\,\\sigma$ constraints $\\omega\\_0=1.04^{+0.91+2.00}\\_{-1.00-1.90}$ and $\\omega\\_a=-7.4^{+3.8+6.8}\\_{-3.2-7.3}$ indicating a beyond $2\\,\\sigma$ preference of quintessence-like dark energy today and an evidence of evolving dark energy at beyond $2\\,\\sigma$ CL, respectively. Our results are different from $\\omega\\_0=-0.55^{+0.39}\\_{-0.21}$ and the $2\\,\\sigma$ upper limit $\\omega\\_a<-1.32$ reported by the DESI collaboration \\cite{DESI:2024mwx}. Employing a data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova, we obtain the $1\\,\\sigma$, $2\\,\\sigma$ and $3\\,\\sigma$ constraints $\\omega\\_0=-0.707^{+0.089+0.18+0.24}\\_{-0.089-0.17-0.22}$ and $\\omega\\_a=-1.09^{+0.38+0.67+0.82}\\_{-0.31-0.72-1.00}$, which reveals a $\\sim4\\,\\sigma$ evidence of dynamical dark energy when the redshift $z\\lesssim0.1$. We verify that the BAO data point from luminous red galaxies at the effective redshift $z\\_{\\rm eff}=0.51$ hardly affects the joint constraint from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova. We also point out the shortcomings and advantages of the binning method widely used in cosmological analyses.\n\n", "2404.13809": "2024-04-22, **Open Cluster Dynamics under the Influence of Outflow-Ambient Interactions**, Muxin Liu et.al., [2404.13809v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13809v1)\n\n Outflowing stars impinging upon ambient gas experience accelerations due to the gravitational feedback from the morphology of the interaction betweem the outflow and the ambient gas. Such \"negative dynamical friction\" (NDF), in contrast to the conventional \"dynamical friction\" (DF), is studied for its impact on the dynamics of open clusters immersed in a uniform ambient gas. We modify the $N$-body integration code REBOUND with both NDF and DF implemented according to the outflow conditions of each star in a consistently constructed model open cluster. The evolution of stars is also involved in determining the gas-star interactions throughout their stellar lives. Compared to DF-only and gas-free models with identical initial conditions, the NDF-affected cluster is puffier and evaporates faster, as indicated by various diagnostics, including lower velocity dispersions and larger half-mass and half-light radii. Neutron stars with fast winds are expelled from the cluster due to their intensive NDF effect, even without the \"kicks\" by asymmetric supernovae. Exploration of parameter space confirms that the NDF effect is generally enhanced with higher ambient gas densities, in qualitatively agreement with the expression of acceleration. Outflow-ambient interactions should be considered for the proper interpretation of the evolution of stellar dynamics in clusters.\n\n"}}
