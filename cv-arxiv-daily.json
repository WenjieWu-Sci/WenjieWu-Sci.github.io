However, the presence of defects and impurities in HPGe crystals can lead to charge trapping, which affects carrier mobility and results in significant energy resolution degradation. In this work, we employ density functional theory with a hybrid functional to study the energetics of possible point defects in Ge. Our findings indicate that n-type group-V impurities, such as phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), and antimony (Sb), form more readily in Ge compared to nitrogen (N), Ge vacancies, and Ge interstitials. Unlike N dopants, which yield deep trap states, P, As, and Sb create shallow traps close to the conduction band edge of Ge. Furthermore, we predict that n-type defects can condense into defect complexes with Ge vacancies. These vacancy-impurity complexes form deep traps in Ge, similar to Ge vacancies, suggesting that both vacancies and vacancy-impurity complexes contribute to charge trapping in these detectors, thereby diminishing their performance.\n\n", "2507.17425": "2025-07-23, **Readout electronics for low occupancy High-Pressure Gas TPCs**, N.

The operation took place between April and July of 2024. We measure the noise characteristics of the system to be sufficiently low and we identify sources of noise that can be further mitigated in the next iteration. We also note that the cooling scheme used in the test requires improvement before full-scale deployment. Despite these necessary improvements, we show that the system can fulfil the needs of a HPgTPC for a fraction of the price of collider readout electronics.\n\n", "2507.17315": "2025-07-23, **Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\u03b3$-ray bursts**, Lu Feng et.al., [2507.17315v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17315v1)\n\n In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations.

Taken together, our findings are suggestive of a coherent scenario in which the shock may contribute to the acceleration of protons, with the target photons potentially originating either from the ambient medium surrounding the jet or from proton synchrotron radiation.

In this letter, an alternative mechanism is presented in which a laser pulse affects the vacuum decay rate of a muon outside the pulse. Quantum interference between the muon decaying with or without interacting with the pulse generates fringes in the electron momentum spectra and can increase the muon lifetime by up to a factor 2.

To explain the absence of a corresponding neutrino signal from the center of the Milky Way, we propose two scenarios: (i) the disruption of the dark matter spike at the Milky Way center due to stellar heating, or (ii) the annihilation into a dark scalar that decays exclusively into neutrinos, with a decay length longer than the size of the Milky Way but shorter than the distance from Earth to NGC 1068.\n\n", "2507.16527": "2025-07-22, **Very-high-energy observations of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 with MAGIC -- Indication of another gamma-ray obscured candidate neutrino source**, K.

Their potential detection through gamma-ray signatures arising from Hawking radiation would provide definitive evidence for their existence and constrain their contribution to the DM abundance. Unlike conventional DM candidates, PBHs emit a unique, thermal-like spectrum of particles as they evaporate, including photons, neutrinos, and possible beyond-the-Standard Model particles. Future high-sensitivity gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM and other next-generation telescopes, will play a pivotal role in this search. With improved energy resolution and sensitivity, these missions can disentangle PBH-originating photons from astrophysical backgrounds, probe subtle spectral features such as multi-peak structures, and test exotic evaporation models. Such observations could either confirm PBHs as a viable DM component or place stringent limits on their abundance across critical mass windows. In this work, we explore the distinguishing features of a double-peaked gamma-ray spectrum produced by PBHs, focusing on the asteroid-mass window ($10^{15}$ g to $10^{17}$ g), where Hawking radiation peaks in the MeV to GeV range. Using a likelihood-based analysis, we demonstrate how future missions could discriminate between single- and double-peaked PBH scenarios, the latter arising in cosmological models predicting multi-modal PBH mass distributions.

We suggest a new method for detecting dark matter axions based on axionelectron elastic scattering. In the pseudoscalar axion model, this interaction can be seen as an effective magnetic field, so high-sensitivity atomic magnetometers can be utilized to measure this interaction. The scattering cross section of this process is significantly amplified by the high number density and occupation number of axion dark matter. The upper limit of the electron-axion coupling coefficient obtained from this process can reach two orders of magnitude higher than previous results at low axion mass, and will exceed the astrophysics limits by using a developing magnetometer.

Mostoghiu Paun et.al., [2507.16930v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16930v1)\n\n Traditional N-body methods introduce localised perturbations in the gravitational forces governing their evolution. These perturbations lead to an artificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale Structure, often referred to as \"beads-on-a-string.\" This issue is particularly apparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at small spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations induced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the suppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian perturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown to minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we investigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for dark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the severity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly improves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a fixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious haloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial conditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo formation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening counterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore, initialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in z=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This sphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying spurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology.

This process has been used for decades to constrain the population of such objects, particularly as a component of dark matter (DM). The effects of light compact objects, such as those in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected. In principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening them, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber velocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical for DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate induced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to zero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in the regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few fast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are measured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the constraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System.

We consider a Gaussian power excess in $P(k)$ followed by a cutoff in select cases; this behavior could arise from early-universe physics that alters the primordial matter power spectrum or DM physics in the radiation-dominated epoch. We find that enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in substructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF) resulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high masses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is sensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the SHMF enhancement depend on the wave number of the $P(k)$ excess and the presence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the SHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution. Additionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center and their concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement. Thus, nonlinear mode coupling must be captured to enable $P(k)$ reconstruction using DM substructure.\n\n", "2507.16720": "2025-07-22, **Abelian-Higgs vortices in the oscillating axion background**, Naoya Kitajima et.al., [2507.16720v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16720v1)\n\n We study the dynamics of Abelian-Higgs vortices in the background of a coherently oscillating axion field.

The statistically controlled samples quantify how the reionization redshift (z\\_reion) correlates with halo mass, local overdensity, and present-day pair properties. Even at fixed mass, haloes in denser regions ionize earlier, and increasing the overdensity smoothing scale systematically suppresses small-scale structure, including local variations and environmental gradients in z\\_reion. Virgo-like clusters accelerate reionization in their surroundings out to ~5-10 cMpc, beyond which local overdensity again becomes the dominant factor. Within LG pairs, reionization timing offsets reach up to ~150 Myr and correlate with present-day halo separation, reflecting sensitivity to large-scale structure rather than mass ratio in driving asynchronous reionization.

Such a process effectively serves as a self-limiting feedback loop, which stalls further mass growth.

Our simulations reveal that early post-bounce gravitational waves signals are dominated by the first six intrinsic mode functions, with variations due to rotation and magnetic fields influencing the signal strength. Strong magnetic fields decelerate core rotation, affecting mode excitation. Regardless of the initial rotation, convection consistently drives a low-frequency mode that lasts throughout the evolution.

Assuming its dust-production rate stays constant over the final 2-3x10^4 yr of its evolution, this star will produce ~0.9-3.7 times the iron dust mass predicted by models, with the range depending on the adopted stellar mass. The implications for dust production in high-redshift galaxies are potentially significant, especially regarding the assumed dust species used in dust evolution models and the timescale of AGB dust formation. Stars on the upper end of the AGB mass range can begin producing dust as early as 30-50 Myr after they form, and they may therefore rival dust production by supernovae at high redshift.\n\n", "2507.16757": "2025-07-22, **A double-degenerate scenario with a merger to explosion delay time to explain type Ia supernova SN 2020aeuh**, Noam Soker et.al., [2507.16757v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16757v1)\n\n I suggest the double-degenerate (DD) scenario with a merger-to-explosion delay (MED) time (the DD-MED scenario) of about 1-2 years to explain the rare properties of the recently analyzed type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2020aeuh. The rare properties are the SN Ia ejecta interacting with a carbon-oxygen (CO)-rich circumstellar material (CSM) at approximately 50 days post-explosion. In this DD-MED scenario, two massive CO white dwarfs (WDs), masses of M1=1.1Mo and M2=1, merge to leave a rapidly rotating lonely WD of about the Chandrasekhar mass. The merger process ejects 0.7Mo to form a nonspherical CO-rich CSM. At the explosion, there is a lonely WD and a detached hydrogen- and helium-deficient CSM. Studies proposed the other lonely WD scenario, the core-degenerate (CD) scenario, to explain several specific SNe Ia and SN Ia remnants. SN 2020aeuh is the first particular SN Ia that is attributed to the DD-MED scenario. Besides being slightly brighter than typical SNe Ia and the CSM interaction, SN 2020aeuh is a normal SN Ia. Therefore, this study strengthens the claim that the lonely WD scenarios, i.e., the DD-MED and CD scenarios, account for most, if not all, normal SNe Ia; all SN Ia scenarios, whether lonely WD or not, might contribute to peculiar SNe Ia.\n\n", "2507.16700": "2025-07-22, **The GHOSDT Simulations: II. Missing Molecules in Simulations of a Self-Regulated Interstellar Medium**, Alon Gurman et.al., [2507.16700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16700v1)\n\n Observations in the Galaxy and nearby spirals have established that the HI-to-H$\\_2$ transition at solar metallicity occurs at gas weight of $P\\_{\\rm DE}/k\\_B\\approx 10^4 \\ \\rm K \\ cm ^{-3}$, similar to solar neighbourhood conditions. Even so, state-of-the-art models of a self-regulated interstellar medium underproduce the molecular fraction ($R\\_{\\rm mol}\\equiv M\\_{\\rm H\\_2}/M\\_{\\rm HI}$) at solar neighbourhood conditions by a factor of $\\approx2-4$. We use the GHOSDT suite of simulations at a mass resolution range of $100-0.25\\ M\\_{\\odot}$ (effective spatial resolution range of $\\sim 20-0.05\\ \\rm pc$) run for 500 Myr to show how this problem is affected by modeling choices such as the inclusion of photoionizing radiation, assumed supernova energy, numerical resolution, inclusion of magnetic fields, and including a model for sub-grid clumping. We find that $R\\_{\\rm mol}$ is not converged even at a resolution of 1 $M\\_{\\odot}$, with $R\\_{\\rm mol}$ increasing by a factor of 2 when resolution is improved from 10 to $1\\ M\\_{\\odot}$. Models excluding either photoionization or magnetic fields result in a factor 2 reduction in $R\\_{\\rm mol}$. The only model that agrees with the observed value of $R\\_{\\rm mol}$ includes our sub-grid clumping model, which enhances $R\\_{\\rm mol}$ by a factor of $\\sim3$ compared with our fiducial model. This increases the time-averaged $R\\_{\\rm mol}$ to $0.25$, in agreement with the Solar circle value, and closer to the observed median value of $0.42$ in regions comparable to the solar neighbourhood in nearby spirals. Our findings show that small-scale clumping in the ISM plays a significant role in H$\\_2$ formation even in high-resolution numerical simulations.\n\n", "2507.16613": "2025-07-22, **Alpha clustering in warm and dense nuclear matter from heavy-ion collisions**, Rui Wang et.al., [2507.16613v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16613v1)\n\n Although light nuclear clusters are known to affect the properties of warm and dilute nuclear matter, their role in warm and dense nuclear matter remains unclear due to the lack of experimental evidence for their modifications by the Mott effect in such an environment. To address this issue, we resort to intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions, where light clusters are mainly produced in the transiently formed warm and dense matter. A kinetic approach, which includes dynamically the formation and dissociation of light clusters, is employed to deduce the strength of the Mott effects and the $\\alpha$-particle fraction in warm and dense nuclear matter from the light-nuclei yields measured by the FOPI Collaboration in central Au$+$Au collisions at energies of $0.25A$ to $0.6A~\\rm GeV$. We find an unexpectedly abundant $\\alpha$ clustering in this environment, which will have profound implications for modeling the nuclear equation of state and describing supernovae and neutron star mergers.\n\n", "2507.16147": "2025-07-22, **Observational constraints on phenomenological emergent dark energy and barotropic dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state parameter**, Jian-Qi Liu et.al., [2507.16147v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16147v1)\n\n While cold dark matter is widely supported by a range of cosmological observations, it encounters several difficulties at smaller scales. These issues have prompted the investigation of various alternative dark matter candidates, leaving the question \"What is dark matter?\" still open. In this work, we propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. We then place constraints on our new model using the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the Pantheon Plus (PP) compilation of Type Ia supernovae (Ia SNe), and the Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) data from Gold2018.
