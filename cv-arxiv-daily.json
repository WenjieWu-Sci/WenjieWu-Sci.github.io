Due to its dense stellar structure, all models cannot avoid the eventual BH formation even though a strongly magnetized model experiences the so-called magnetorotational explosion prior to the BH formation. One intriguing phenomenon observed in the strongly magnetized model is the formation of a relativistic jet in the post-BH formation. The relativistic jet is the outcome of a combination of strong magnetic fields and low-density materials above the BH. The jet further enhances the explosion energy beyond $\\sim10^{52}$ erg, which is well exceeding the gravitational overburden ahead of the shock.

In anticipation of this, we forecast the capability of two of the leading long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE and T2HK, to look for new flavor-dependent neutrino interactions with electrons, protons, and neutrons that could affect the transitions between different flavors. We interpret their sensitivity in the context of long-range neutrino interactions, mediated by a new neutral boson lighter than $10^{-10}$ eV, and sourced by the vast amount of nearby and distant matter in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and beyond. For the first time, we explore the sensitivity of DUNE and T2HK to a wide variety of $U(1)^\\prime$ symmetries, built from combinations of lepton and baryon numbers, each of which induces new interactions that affect oscillations differently. We find ample sensitivity: in all cases, DUNE and T2HK may constrain the existence of the new interaction even if it is supremely feeble, may discover it, and, in some cases, may identify the symmetry responsible for it.\n\n", "2404.02636": "2024-04-03, **Sibyll$^{\\bigstar}$**, Felix Riehn et.al., [2404.02636v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02636v1)\n\n In the last decade, an increasing number of datasets have revealed a consistent discrepancy between the number of muons measured in ultra-high-energy extensive air showers (EAS) and the numbers predicted by simulations. This gap persists despite incorporating Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data into the tuning of current hadronic interaction models, leading to the phenomenon often termed the ''muon puzzle''. To gain a deeper understanding of the potential origins of this muon puzzle, we have developed Sibyll$^{\\bigstar}$, a series of phenomenologically modified versions of Sibyll 2.3d. In these models, we have increased muon production by altering $\\rho^0$, baryon-antibaryon pair, or kaon production in hadronic multiparticle production processes. These variants remain within bounds from provided by accelerator measurements, including those from the LHC and fixed-target experiments, notably NA49 and NA61, showing a level of consistency comparable to Sibyll 2.3d. Our findings show that these modifications can increase the muon count in EAS by up to 35%, while minimally affecting the depth of shower maximum ($X\\_{\\rm max}$) and other shower variables. Additionally, we assess the impact of these modifications on various observables, including inclusive muon and neutrino fluxes and the multiplicities of muon bundles in deep underground and water/ice Cherenkov detectors. We aim for at least one of these model variants to offer a more accurate representation of EAS data at the highest energies, thereby enhancing the quality of Monte Carlo predictions used in training neural networks.

In this minimal setup, Leptogenesis is purely flavored, and a second Majorana neutrino is not necessary because the Yukawa couplings of the extra doublets yield the necessary $CP$-odd phases. The mechanism we employ can also be applied to a wide range of scenarios with at least one singlet and two gauge multiplets.

Choosing the spacetime to be a flat spacetime perturbed linearly by a spherical plane gravitational wave, we show that scalar particles may indeed be produced in a perturbative manner. Our formulation is valid for any linear gravitational wave background profile, and should generalize straightforwardly to production of massless elementary particles of diverse species (photons, neutrinos). In this aspect, irrespective of the astrophysical nature of the binary merger sourcing the gravitational wave signal, one expects the dynamical nature of the spacetime to produce all species of light particles.

The asymmetries caused by the explosion are encoded into the line profiles which appear in the nebular phase of the SN evolution -- with particularly clean imprints in He star explosions. Here, we carry out nine different supernova simulations of He-core progenitors, exploding them in 3D with parametrically varied neutrino luminosities using the $\\texttt{Prometheus-HotB}$ code, hydrodynamically evolving the models to the homologeous phase. We then compute nebular phase spectra with the 3D NLTE spectral synthesis code $\\texttt{ExTraSS}$ (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator). We study how line widths and shifts depend on progenitor mass, explosion energy, and viewing angle. We compare the predicted line profile properties against a large set of Type Ib observations, and discuss the degree to which current neutrino-driven explosions can match observationally inferred asymmetries. With self-consistent 3D modelling -- circumventing the difficulties of representing $^{56}$Ni mixing and clumping accurately in 1D models -- we find that neither low-mass He cores exploding with high energies nor high-mass cores exploding with low energies contribute to the Type Ib SN population. Models which have line profile widths in agreement with this population give sufficiently large centroid shifts for calcium emission lines. Calcium is more strongly affected by explosion asymmetries connected to the neutron star kicks than oxygen and magnesium.

We explore environmental interactions with dark matter spikes, stellar distributions, accretion disks, and combine and compare them. We discuss the existence and properties of dark matter spikes in the presence of these environmental effects. The signatures of the environmental effects, such as the phase space flow, dephasing, deshifting of the periapse, and alignment with accretion disks, are examined. These signatures are quantified in isolated spike systems, in dry, and in wet inspirals. We generally find dark matter effects to be subdominant to the other environmental effects, but their impact on the waveform is still observable and identifiable.

One such relation, between the atomic hydrogen (HI) mass of central galaxies ($M\\_{\\rm{HI,c}}$) and the total mass of their host halos ($M\\_{\\rm{halo}}$), has attracted significant interest in the last few years. In this work, we use the extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey to examine the scatter of the HI-halo mass relation for a representative sample of central galaxies. Our findings reveal a flat median relation at $\\rm{log}\\_{10}$$(M\\_{\\rm{HI,c}}/\\rm{M}\\_{\\odot}) \\approx 9.40$, across $11.1 < \\rm{log}\\_{10}$$(M\\_{\\rm{halo}}/\\rm{M\\_{\\odot}}) < 14.1$.

The scatter of this relation and the stellar specific angular momentum of centrals have a strong link (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient $\\geq 0.5$). Comparisons with simulations suggest that the kinematic state of host halos may be primarily driving this scatter.

We investigate fluctuations in pulsar timing originating from the coherent oscillation of scalar dark matter up to the subleading order of $\\mathcal{O}(k/m)$, as well as from acoustic oscillations of non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter. Both types of dark matter can generate oscillating Newtonian potential perturbations and curvature perturbations, thereby affecting pulsar timing.

Specifically, pulsar timing residuals from non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter exhibit different directional dependence and are shown to be more sensitive to the distance to a pulsar. We also study the angular correlation patterns from these dark matters in the NANOGrav 15-year data set.

For this, we employ a recently developed method to compute the evolution of confined quantum scalar fields in a globally hyperbolic spacetime by means of time-dependent Bogoliubov transformations. As a result, we show that particle production is reduced due to the presence of the chameleon field. In addition, our results for the Bogoliubov coefficients and the mean number of created particles agree with known results in the absence of a chameleon field.

In CRESST, this low energy background manifests itself as a steeply rising population of events below 200 eV. A novel detector design named doubleTES using two identical TESs on the target crystal was studied to investigate the hypothesis that the events are sensor-related.

We find that the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is significantly enhanced at the break scale, which can account for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation, without affecting the CMB constraint on large scales. The behavior of the curvature perturbation is carefully analyzed and we find a few notable new features in the spectrum. In particular, we find that the $k^3$ growth of the spectrum of toward the end of the first stage of inflation. We argue that this is a universal feature common to all two-stage models where the field dominating the second stage is heavy during the first stage. By appropriately tuning the model parameters, we find that our model can realize the scenario of PBHs as the cold dark matter of the Universe.

We find that interaction with detached CSM can produce a slowly rising phase in the light curve seen in some interacting SN Ibc, which is difficult to reproduce by interaction with CSM of a density profile motivated from wind or eruptions that are continuous down to the star. We also show that SNe having double peaks in their light curves with timescales of months (e.g., SN 2022xxf) can be explained by radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co, followed by interaction with detached CSM.\n\n", "2404.02139": "2024-04-02, **Lensed Type Ia Supernova \"Encore\" at z=2: The First Instance of Two Multiply-Imaged Supernovae in the Same Host Galaxy**, J. D. R. Pierel et.al., [2404.02139v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02139v2)\n\n A bright ($m\\_{\\rm F150W,AB}$=24 mag), $z=1.95$ supernova (SN) candidate was discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging acquired on 2023 November 17. The SN is quintuply-imaged as a result of strong gravitational lensing by a foreground galaxy cluster, detected in three locations, and remarkably is the second lensed SN found in the same host galaxy. The previous lensed SN was called \"Requiem\", and therefore the new SN is named \"Encore\". This makes the MACS J0138.0$-$2155 cluster the first known system to produce more than one multiply-imaged SN. Moreover, both SN Requiem and SN Encore are Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia), making this the most distant case of a galaxy hosting two SNe Ia. Using parametric host fitting, we determine the probability of detecting two SNe Ia in this host galaxy over a $\\sim10$ year window to be $\\approx3\\%$. These observations have the potential to yield a Hubble Constant ($H\\_0$) measurement with $\\sim10\\%$ precision, only the third lensed SN capable of such a result, using the three visible images of the SN. Both SN Requiem and SN Encore have a fourth image that is expected to appear within a few years of $\\sim2030$, providing an unprecedented baseline for time-delay cosmography.\n\n", "2404.02110": "2024-04-02, **Tightening the reins on non-minimal dark sector physics: Interacting Dark Energy with dynamical and non-dynamical equation of state**, William Giar\u00e8 et.al., [2404.02110v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02110v1)\n\n We present a comprehensive reassessment of the state of Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) cosmology, namely models featuring a non-gravitational interaction between Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). To achieve high generality, we extend the dark sector physics by considering two different scenarios: a non-dynamical DE equation of state $w\\_0\\neq-1$, and a dynamical $w(a)=w\\_0+w\\_a(1-a)$. In both cases, we distinguish two different physical regimes resulting from a phantom or quintessence equation of state. To circumvent early-time superhorizon instabilities, the energy-momentum transfer should occur in opposing directions within the two regimes, resulting in distinct phenomenological outcomes. We study quintessence and phantom non-dynamical and dynamical models in light of two independent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments - the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We analyze CMB data both independently and in combination with Supernovae (SN) distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon-Plus catalog and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Our results update and extend the state-of-the-art analyses, significantly narrowing the parameter space allowed for these models and limiting their overall ability to reconcile cosmological tensions. Although considering different combinations of data leaves some freedom to increase $H\\_0$ towards the value measured by the SH0ES collaboration, our most constraining dataset (CMB+BAO+SN) indicates that fully reconciling the tension solely within the framework of IDE remains challenging.\n\n", "2404.01905": "2024-04-02, **On the surface helium abundance of B-type hot subdwarf stars from the WD+MS channel of Type Ia supernovae**, Rui-Jie Ji et.al., [2404.01905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01905v1)\n\n The origin of intermediate helium (He)-rich hot subdwarfs are still unclear. Previous studies have suggested that some surviving Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) companions from the white dwarf~+~main-sequence (WD+MS) channel may contribute to the intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. However, previous studies ignored the impact of atomic diffusion on the post-explosion evolution of surviving companion stars of SNe Ia, leading to that they could not explain the observed surface He abundance of intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. In this work, by taking the atomic diffusion and stellar wind into account, we trace the surviving companions of SNe Ia from the WD+MS channel using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code \\textsc{MESA} until they evolve into hot subdwarfs. We find that the surface He-abundances of our surviving companion models during their core He-burning phases are in a range of $-1 \\lesssim {\\rm log}(N\\_{\\rm He}/N\\_{\\rm H}) \\lesssim 0$, which are consistent with those observed in intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. This seems to further support that surviving companions of SNe Ia in the WD+MS channel are possible to form some intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs.\n\n", "2404.01776": "2024-04-02, **Diversity in hydrogen-rich envelope mass of type II supernovae (I): $V$-band light curve modeling**, Qiliang Fang et.al., [2404.01776v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01776v1)\n\n We conduct a systematic study on the light curves of type II supernovae (SNe II) to investigate how they are affected by the physical properties of the progenitor and the nature of the explosion. The calculations of pre-supernova evolution, the launch of the explosion, and the light curve are carried out by \\texttt{MESA} and \\texttt{STELLA}. Our study encompasses a wide range of zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) masses (10 - 20 $M\\_{\\rm \\odot}$), wind mass-loss rates (which control the range of hydrogen-rich envelope mass to be 3 - 12 $M\\_{\\rm \\odot}$), explosion energies (0.1 - 2.5 $\\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg), and $^{56}$Ni masses (0 - 0.15 $M\\_{\\rm \\odot}$). Our analyses reveal that when the explosion energy is fixed, the light curve is primarily determined by the properties of the hydrogen-rich envelope, despite the large variation in the ZAMS masses. The dependencies of the light-curve characteristics on the envelope mass, radius, and explosion energy are investigated, and we establish the scaling relations connecting these quantities. We further derive a formula that corrects for effects of the $^{56}$Ni heating based on observables. Using the derived equations, we develop a method that can constrain the envelope mass with uncertainty within 1 $M\\_{\\rm \\odot}$ based on photometry. This method is applied to a large sample of $\\sim$ 100 SNe II, which reveals a considerably broader range of the envelope masses estimated from observables as compared to those predicted by single star models evolving with standard stellar wind; this finding indicates that a large fraction of SNe II experience substantial mass-loss beyond the standard mass-loss prescription prior to their explosions, highlighting the uncertainties involved in the massive star evolution and pre-SN mass-loss mechanism.\n\n", "2404.01658": "2024-04-02, **Finite-temperature expansion of the dense-matter equation of state**, Debora Mroczek et.al., [2404.01658v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01658v1)\n\n In this work we provide a new, well-controlled expansion of the equation of state of dense matter from zero to finite temperatures ($T$), while covering a wide range of charge fractions ($Y\\_Q$), from pure neutron to isospin symmetric nuclear matter. Our expansion can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point neutron star observations, while maintaining agreement with laboratory data, in a model independent way. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data that can help constrain the finite $T$ equation of state. With our new method, we can quantify the uncertainty in our finite $T$ and $Y\\_Q$ expansions in a well-controlled manner without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We can reproduce results from a microscopic equation of state up to $T=100$ MeV for baryon chemical potential $\\mu\\_B\\gtrsim 1100$ MeV ($\\sim1-2 \\ n\\_{\\rm sat}$) within $5\\%$ error, with even better results for larger $\\mu\\_B$ and/or lower $T$.
