The Far Detector of DUNE will consist of four 17 kton liquid argon Time Projection Chambers (LAr-TPC). Inside a LAr-TPC, a Photon Detection System (PDS) is needed to detect the scintillation light produced by the interacting particles. The PDS signal provides the interaction time for non-beam events and improves the calorimetric reconstruction. To validate DUNE technology, two large-scale prototypes, of 750 ton of LAr each, have been constructed at CERN, ProtoDUNE-HD and ProtoDUNE-VD. The PDS of both prototypes is based on the XArapuca concept, a SiPM-based device that provides good detection efficiency covering large surfaces at a reasonable cost.

Nevertheless, they are subject to convolution with a non-trivial transfer function. Within the standard thermal history, shifts in the temperature-redshift relation combine with damping effects by free streaming neutrinos to non-trivially process different wavelengths during radiation domination, with subsequently negligible effects at later times. Presuming a nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum, one obtains a characteristic late time spectrum, deviations from which would indicate departures from the standard thermal history. Given the paucity of probes of the early universe physics before nucleosynthesis, it is useful to classify how deviations from the standard thermal history of the early universe can be constrained from observations of the late time stochastic background. The late time spectral density has a plateau at high frequencies that can in principle be significantly enhanced or suppressed relative to the standard thermal history depending on the equation of state of the epoch intervening reheating and the terminal phase of radiation domination, imprinting additional features from bursts of entropy production, and additional damping at intermediate scales via anisotropic stress production. In this paper, we survey phenomenologically motivated scenarios of early matter domination, kination, and late time decaying particles as representative non-standard thermal histories, elaborate on their late time stochastic background, and discuss constraints on different model scenarios.\n\n", "2412.15067": "2024-12-19, **General Form of Effective Operators from Hidden Sectors**, Aqeel Ahmed et.al., [2412.15067v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15067v1)\n\n We perform a model-independent analysis of the dimension-six terms that are generated in the low energy effective theory when a hidden sector that communicates with the Standard Model (SM) through a specific portal operator is integrated out. We work within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework and consider the Higgs, neutrino and hypercharge portals. We find that, for each portal, the forms of the leading dimension-six terms in the low-energy effective theory are fixed and independent of the dynamics in the hidden sector. For the Higgs portal, we find that two independent dimension-six terms are generated, one of which has a sign that, under certain conditions, is fixed by the requirement that the dynamics in the hidden sector be causal and unitary. In the case of the neutrino portal, for a single generation of SM fermions and assuming that the hidden sector does not violate lepton number, a unique dimension-six term is generated, which corresponds to a specific linear combination of operators in the Warsaw basis. For the hypercharge portal, a unique dimension-six term is generated, which again corresponds to a specific linear combination of operators in the Warsaw basis. For both the neutrino and hypercharge portals, under certain conditions, the signs of these terms are fixed by the requirement that the hidden sector be causal and unitary. We perform a global fit of these dimension-six terms to electroweak precision observables, Higgs measurements and diboson production data and determine the current bounds on their coefficients.\n\n", "2412.15055": "2024-12-19, **Leptoquark-induced radiative masses for active and sterile neutrinos within the framework of the 3-3-1 model**, A.

While optical surveys have been the primary source for cosmic shear measurements, radio continuum surveys offer a promising avenue. Relevant radio sources, principally star-forming galaxies, have populations with higher mean redshifts and are less affected by dust extinction compared to optical sources.

These constraints are also driven by higher redshifts and larger scales than other galaxy-CMB cross-correlations, potentially shedding light on different physical models.

In a three-neutrino framework, we give predictions of the corresponding neutrino fluxes and the expected number of events in the Super-Kamiokande+Gadolinium, the Hyper-Kamiokande, the JUNO and the DUNE experiments. In our analysis, we employ supernova simulations from different groups and include current uncertainties from both the evolving core-collapse supernova rate and the fraction of failed supernovae. We perform the first Bayesian analysis to see our ability to disentangle the cases in presence and absence of neutrino decay. To this aim we combine the expected events in inverse beta-decay and the neutrino-argon detection channels. We also discuss neutrino-electron, neutrino-proton and of neutrino-oxygen scattering.

These new states, which are required from gauge coupling unification and neutrino oscillation data to have masses below $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ TeV, may be accessible to future collider experiments. Additionally, the model can be probed in proton decay searches. Our Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of model parameters shows a high likelihood of observable $p \\rightarrow e^+ \\pi^0$ decay signal in the first decade of Hyper-Kamiokande operation. The model predicts a vector-like down-type quark at the TeV scale, utilized for realistic fermion mass generation and gauge coupling unification.

Such a tradeoff relation is universal and fundamental for multiparameter linear measurement since arising from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Compared with the Holevo Cram\\'er-Rao bound, our tradeoff bound can completely identify the dependence between the attainable precision limits on estimated parameters. The dependence becomes more obvious such that the individual precision can not simultaneously reach the quantum limit as the so-called incompatible coefficient rises. Eventually, we find a necessary condition under which an optimal measurement protocol can saturate the general tradeoff relation, and show that the measurement phase can be tuned for adjusting different precision weight. This result is related to many applications, particularly detuned GW sensors for searching post-merger remnants due to the direct relation between the detuned frequency and incompatible coefficient.\n\n", "2412.14949": "2024-12-19, **The Line operators in the G2HDM model**, Rui Yang et.al., [2412.14949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14949v1)\n\n We describe the global structure of a particle model with dark matter called G2HDM, which incorporates a dark sector represented by $SU(2)\\_{H} \\times U(1)\\_{X}\\;$.

Because dark matter must be non-relativistic, the effects of its scattering with Standard Model particles are negligible and generally go unnoticed. However, due to the large occupation number of ultralight dark matter, the sum of all scatterings leads to a classical field-like interaction with Standard Model particles. In the case of an axion-like particle, this scattering imparts a parity violating effect. If this collective scattering with axion-like particles is inserted into the one-loop quantum electrodynamics diagram, the parity violation imparted by this scattering will convert the anomalous magnetic moment contribution into an electric dipole moment. This contribution is quite large and leads to a prediction inconsistent with precision measurements of the proton and electron electric dipole moments, unless their couplings to the axion-like particles are very weak. As a result, the constraints on the couplings of axion-like particle dark matter to the electron and proton are improved by as much as eleven and six orders of magnitude, respectively.\n\n", "2412.14621": "2024-12-19, **Diversity and universality: evolution of dwarf galaxies with self-interacting dark matter**, Zhichao Carton Zeng et.al., [2412.14621v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14621v1)\n\n Dark matter halos with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) experience a unique evolutionary phenomenon, in that their central regions eventually collapse to high density through the runaway gravothermal process after initially forming a large and low-density core. When coupled with orbital evolution, this is expected to naturally produce a large diversity in dark-matter halos' inner mass distribution, potentially explaining the diversity problem of dwarf galaxies. However, it remains unknown how the diversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed luminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In this work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles (dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of field and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on their halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light ratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Importantly, we find signs of universality in the evolution pathways, or ``tidal tracks'', of SIDM dwarf satellites, which are physically interpretable and potentially parameterizable.

Surprisingly, this candidate can be as light as a few GeV.

The low energy dark sector consists of one flavor that is electrically neutral and an almost electroweak singlet. The dark matter candidate is the lightest baryon consisting of $N$ of these light flavors leading to a highly suppressed elastic scattering rate with the SM. The equilibration sector consists of vector-like dark quarks that transform under the electroweak group, ensuring that the dark sector can reach thermal equilibrium with the SM in the early Universe.
