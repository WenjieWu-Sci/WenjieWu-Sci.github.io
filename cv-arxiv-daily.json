CCSNe local to the Milky Way are extremely rare, so it is paramount that detectors are prepared to observe the signal when it arrives. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a gigaton water Cherenkov detector below the South Pole, is sensitive to the burst of neutrinos released by a Galactic CCSN at a level $>$10$\\sigma$. This burst of neutrinos precedes optical emission by hours to days, enabling neutrinos to serve as an early warning for follow-up observation. IceCube's detection capabilities make it a cornerstone of the global network of neutrino detectors monitoring for Galactic CCSNe, the SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS 2.0). In this contribution, we describe IceCube's sensitivity to Galactic CCSNe and strategies for operational readiness, including \"fire drill\" data challenges. We also discuss coordination with SNEWS 2.0.\n\n", "2308.01838": "2023-08-03, **Parametrized uncertainties in the spectral function model of neutrino charged-current quasielastic interactions for oscillation analyses**, J. Chakrani et.al., [2308.01838v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01838v1)\n\n A substantial fraction of systematic uncertainties in neutrino oscillation experiments stem from the lack of precision in modeling the nuclear target in neutrino-nucleus interactions. Whilst this has driven significant progress in the development of improved nuclear models for neutrino scattering, it is crucial that the models used in neutrino data analyses be accompanied by parameters and associated uncertainties that allow the coverage of plausible nuclear physics. Based on constraints from electron scattering data, we develop such a set of parameters, which can be applied to nuclear shell models, and test their application to the Benhar et al spectral function model. The parametrization is validated through a series of maximum likelihood fits to cross-section measurements made by the T2K and MINERvA experiments, which also permit an exploration of the power of near-detector data to provide constraints on the parameters in neutrino oscillation analyses.\n\n", "2308.01565": "2023-08-03, **New Constraint on Dark Photon at T2K Off-Axis Near Detector**, Takeshi Araki et.al., [2308.01565v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01565v1)\n\n The T2K experiment is one of the most powerful long-baseline experiments to investigate neutrino oscillations. The off-axis near detector called ND280 is installed 280 m downstream from the neutrino production target to measure the neutrino energy spectrum. In this paper, we study the capability of the ND280 detector to search for the dark photon produced through the meson rare decay and proton bremsstrahlung processes at the proton beam dump. We find that the ten-year operation of T2K with the ND280 detector excludes the unexplored parameter region for the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing.

In this study, we explore a particular class of longer-lived mediators that are produced from photons, charged mesons, neutral mesons, and $e^\\pm$ that arise in proton-beam fixed-target-type neutrino experiments. This class of mediators encompasses light scalars that appear in theories like extended Higgs sectors, muon(electro)philic scalars, etc. We evaluate the sensitivities of these mediators at beam-based neutrino experiments such as the finished ArgoNeuT, ongoing MicroBooNE, SBND, ICARUS, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. We realize that scalars are more enhanced while produced from three-body decay of charged mesons, especially if they are muonphilic in nature. For scenarios that contain muonphilic scalars, these experiments can probe unexplored regions of parameter space that can explain the current discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of muons. The sensitivity of electrophilic scalars at the DUNE Near Detector can explore new regions. We also show that Bethe-Heitler scattering processes can be used to probe flavor-specific lepton final states even for the mediator masses below twice the lepton mass.\n\n", "2308.01403": "2023-08-02, **Supernova Simulations Confront SN 1987A Neutrinos**, Damiano F.

To this end, we construct a suite of spherically symmetric supernova models with the Prometheus-Vertex code, using four different equations of state and five choices of final baryonic neutron-star (NS) mass in the 1.36-1.93 M$\\_\\odot$ range. Our models include muons and proto-neutron star (PNS) convection by a mixing-length approximation. The time-integrated signals of our 1.44 M$\\_\\odot$ models agree reasonably well with the combined data of the four relevant experiments, IMB, Kam-II, BUST, and LSD, but the high-threshold IMB detector alone favors a NS mass of 1.7-1.8 M$\\_\\odot$, whereas Kam-II alone prefers a mass around 1.4 M$\\_\\odot$. The cumulative energy distributions in these two detectors are well matched by models for such NS masses, and the previous tension between predicted mean neutrino energies and the combined measurements is gone, with and without flavor swap. Generally, our predicted signals do not strongly depend on assumptions about flavor mixing, because the PNS flux spectra depend only weakly on antineutrino flavor. While our models show compatibility with the events detected during the first seconds, PNS convection and nucleon correlations in the neutrino opacities lead to short PNS cooling times of 5-9 s, in conflict with the late event bunches in Kam-II and BUST after 8-9 s, which are also difficult to explain by background. Speculative interpretations include the onset of fallback of transiently ejected material onto the NS, a late phase transition in the nuclear medium, e.g., from hadronic to quark matter, or other effects that add to the standard PNS cooling emission and either stretch the signal or provide a late source of energy. More research, including systematic 3D simulations, is needed to assess these open issues.\n\n", "2308.01380": "2023-08-02, **Lessons from LHC on the LFV Higgs decays $h \\to \\ell_a \\ell_b$ in the Two-Higgs Doublet Models**, M.

Current limits on these decays are a source of valuable information on the structure of the Yukawa and Higgs sectors. The LFV Higgs couplings can arise within the general Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM); the predicted rates for these decay modes depend on the specific Yukawa structure being considered, ranging from a vanishing branching ratio at tree-level for some versions (2HDM-I, II, X, Y), up to large and detectable ratios within the general 2HDM-III. An attractive scenario is given by the texturized version of the model (2HDM-Tx), with the Yukawa matrices having some texture zeros, such as the minimal version with the so-called Cheng-Sher ansazt. We study the constraints on the parameter space of the 2HDM provided by experimental and theoretical restrictions, and use them to study the detection of LFV Higgs modes at LHC. We find several encouraging scenarios to the search for the decay $h \\to\\tau\\mu$ that could be achieved in the High-Luminosity LHC. On the other hand, LFV Higgs couplings can also be induced at one-loop level in the 2HDM with neutrino masses, with the loops being mediated by neutrino interactions; we find that the resulting branching ratios are of order $10^{-7}$ at best, which is out of the reach of current and future phases of the LHC.\n\n", "2308.01341": "2023-08-02, **Thermal effects in freeze-in neutrino dark matter production**, A.

Our treatment accounts for thermal effects in the effective couplings, generated via neutrino mixing, of the new heavy neutrinos with the Standard Model gauge and Higgs bosons and can be applied to several low-energy fermion seesaw scenarios featuring heavy neutrinos in thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma.

With appropriate detector parameters and background rejection, an estimate of the reactor power can be derived from the measured antineutrino event rate. Antineutrino detectors are potentially attractive as a safeguards technology that can monitor reactor operations and thermal power from a distance. Advanced reactors have diverse features that may present challenges for current safeguards methods. By comparison, neutrino detectors offer complementary features, including a remote, continuous, unattended, and near-real-time monitoring capability, that may make them useful for safeguarding certain classes of advanced reactors. This study investigates the minimum depth and size of an antineutrino detector for a SMR to meet safeguards needs for advanced reactors. Extrapolating performance from several prior reactor antineutrino experiments, this study uses an analytical approach to develop a possible design for a remote antineutrino-based monitoring device.\n\n", "2308.01233": "2023-08-02, **Swampland criteria and neutrino generation in a non-cold dark matter universe**, Martiros Khurshudyan et.al., [2308.01233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01233v1)\n\n In this paper, the implications of string Swampland criteria for a dark energy-dominated universe, where we have a deviation from the cold dark matter model, will be discussed. In particular, we have considered two models. One of them is one parameter model, while the second one has been crafted to reveal the dynamics in the deviation. The analysis has been obtained through the use of Gaussian processes (GPs) and $H(z)$ expansion rate data (a $30$-point sample deduced from a differential age method and a $10$-point sample obtained from the radial BAO method). We learned that the tension with the Swampland criteria still will survive as in the cases of the models where dark matter is cold. In the analysis besides mentioned $40$-point $H(z)$ data, we used the latest values of $H\\_{0}$ reported by the Planck and Hubble missions to reveal possible solutions for the $H\\_{0}$ tension problem.

Even if a Galactic core-collapse supernova is optically obscured or collapses to a black hole instead of exploding, it will be detectable via the O(10) MeV neutrino burst emitted during the collapse. We discuss a search for such events covering the time between April 17, 2008 and December 31, 2019. Considering the average data taking and analysis uptime of 91.7% after all selection cuts, this is equivalent to 10.735 years of continuous data taking. In order to test the most conservative neutrino production scenario, the selection cuts were optimized for a model based on a 8.8 solar mass progenitor collapsing to an O-Ne-Mg core. Conservative assumptions on the effects of neutrino oscillations in the exploding star were made. The final selection cut was set to ensure that the probability to detect such a supernova within the Milky Way exceeds 99%. No such neutrino burst was found in the data after performing a blind analysis. Hence, a 90% C.L. upper limit on the rate of core-collapse supernovae out to distances of ~ 25kpc was determined to be 0.23/yr. For the more distant Magellanic Clouds, only high neutrino luminosity supernovae will be detectable by IceCube, unless external information on the burst time is available. We determined a model-independent limit by parameterizing the dependence on the neutrino luminosity and the energy spectrum.\n\n", "2308.01083": "2023-08-02, **Beaming patterns of neutrino emission from photo-pion production in relativistic jets**, Markus Boettcher et.al., [2308.01083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01083v1)\n\n In the light of growing evidence that blazars are responsible for part of the astrophysical very-high-energy neutrino flux detected by IceCube, models for neutrino production through photo-pion interactions in blazar jets have been developed. Evidence is also mounting that photon fields originating external to the jet are strongly favored over the co-moving primary electron synchrotron photon field as target for photo-pion interactions. Even though those external photon fields appear highly anisotropic in the co-moving frame of the emission region, current models usually consider neutrino production to occur isotropically in the co-moving frame, resulting in a beaming pattern that is identical to intrinsically isotropic synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. In this paper, we derive the resulting beaming patterns of neutrinos produced by interactions wich external photon fields, taking into account all relevant anisotropy effects. It is shown that neutrino emission resulting from photo-pion production on a stationary and isotropic (in the AGN rest frame) external photon field is significantly more strongly beamed along the jet direction than intrinsically isotropic emission. For the most highly beamed sources, this implies that expected neutrino fluxes are grossly under-estimated or jet-power requirements for the production of a given neutrino flux grossly over-estimated when not accounting for the proper Doppler boosting and beaming characteristics.\n\n", "2308.01047": "2023-08-02, **Searching for high-energy neutrinos from shock-interaction powered supernovae with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory**, Massimiliano Lincetto et.al., [2308.01047v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01047v1)\n\n The sources of the astrophysical neutrino flux discovered by IceCube are for the most part unresolved. Extragalactic core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have been suggested as candidate multi-messenger sources. In interaction-powered supernovae, a shock propagates in a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), producing a bright optical emission and potentially accelerating particles to relativistic energies. Shock interaction is believed to be the main energy source for Type IIn supernovae (identified by narrow lines in the spectrum), hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae and a subset of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae. Production of high-energy neutrinos is expected in collisions between the accelerated protons in the shocks and the cold CSM particles. We select a catalog of interaction-powered supernovae from the Bright Transient Survey of the Zwicky Transient Facility. We exploit a novel modeling effort that connects the time evolution of the optical emission to the properties of the ejecta and the CSM, allowing us to set predictions of the neutrino flux for each source.

The two main scientific goals are the determination of the neutrino mass ordering and the discovery and observation of high-energy neutrino sources in the Universe.

Radio waves propagate through ice with a kilometer-long attenuation length, hence a sparse radio array allows us to instrument a huge volume of ice to achieve a sufficient sensitivity to detect neutrinos with energies above tens of PeV. The different signal topologies for neutrino-induced events measured by the optical and in-ice radio detector - the radio detector is mostly sensitive to the cascades produced in the neutrino interaction, while the optical detector can detect long-ranging muon and tau leptons with high accuracy - yield highly complementary information. When detected in coincidence, these signals will allow us to reconstruct the neutrino energy and arrival direction with high fidelity. Furthermore, if events are detected in coincidence with a sufficient rate, they resemble the unique opportunity to study systematic uncertainties and to cross-calibrate both detector components.

We have used the stacked HI velocity dispersion and HI surface densities to derive q in the outer disk regions. Our most important result is that gas dominated galaxies (such as LSB dwarfs) that have M(gas)/M(baryons)>0.5 have oblate halos (q<0.55), whereas stellar dominated galaxies have a range of q values from 0.2 to 1.3. We also find a significant positive correlation between q and stellar mass, which indicates that galaxies with massive stellar disks have a higher probability of having halos that are spherical or slightly prolate, whereas low mass galaxies preferably have oblate halos.

Here, we analyze the orbital structure on three stellar disk N-body models embedded in a live dark matter halo. During the evolution of the models, disks naturally form a bar that buckles out of the galactic plane at different ages of the galaxy evolution generating boxy, X, peanut, and/or elongated shapes. To understand how the orbit families hold the bar structure, we evaluate the orbital evolution using the frequency analysis on phase space coordinates for all disk particles at different time intervals. We analyze the density maps morphology of the 2:1 family as the bar potential evolves. We showed that the families of orbits providing bar support exhibit variations during different stages of its evolutionary process, specifically prior to and subsequent to the buckling phase, likewise in the secular evolution of the bar. The disk-dominated model develops an internal boxy structure after the first Gyr. Afterwards, the outer part of the disk evolves into a peanut-shape, which lasts till the end of the simulation.

This enables us to examine partial-wave unitarity and accurately describe the freeze-out dynamics down to very low temperatures. In the non-Abelian case, we find that highly excited states can prevent the particles from freezing out, supporting a continuous depletion in the regime consistent with perturbativity and unitarity. We apply our formalism to a simplified dark matter model featuring a colored and electrically charged $t$-channel mediator. Our focus is on the regime of superWIMP production which is commonly characterized by a mediator freeze-out followed by its late decay into dark matter. In contrast, we find that excited states render mediator depletion efficient all the way until its decay, introducing a dependence of the dark matter density on the mediator lifetime as a novel feature.

We focus on high-energy gamma rays with TeV energies travelling over cosmological distances. We include a full treatment of the intergalactic electromagnetic cascades triggered by the gamma rays. Finally, we discuss the impact of this improved treatment of the propagation for current and future ALP searches.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2308.01875": "2023-08-03, **Carnegie Supernova Project-I and -II: Measurements of $H_0$ using Cepheid, TRGB, and SBF Distance Calibration to Type Ia Supernovae**, Syed A. Uddin et.al., [2308.01875v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01875v1)\n\n We present an analysis of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe~Ia) from both the Carnegie Supernova Project~I (CSP-I) and II (CSP-II), and extend the Hubble diagram from the optical to the near-infrared wavelengths ($uBgVriYJH$). We calculate the Hubble constant, $H\\_0$ using various distance calibrators: Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), and Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF). Combining all methods of calibrations, we derive $\\rm H\\_0=71.43 \\pm 0.62 \\ (stat) \\pm 2.43 \\ (sys) \\ km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}$ from $B$-band, and $\\rm H\\_0=72.65 \\pm 0.63 \\ (stat) \\pm 2.88 \\ (sys) \\ km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}$ from $H$-band. By assigning equal weight to the Cepheid, TRGB, and SBF calibrators, we derive the systematic errors required for consistency in the first rung of the distance ladder, resulting in an increased systematic error in $H\\_0$. As a result, the tension between the late-time $H\\_0$ we derive by combining the various distance calibrators and the early-time $H\\_0$ from the Cosmic Microwave Background is reduced. The highest precision in SN~Ia luminosity is found in the $Y$ band ($0.12\\pm0.01$ mag), as defined by the intrinsic scatter ($\\sigma\\_{int}$). We revisit SN~Ia Hubble residual-host mass correlations and recover previous results that these correlations do not change significantly between the optical and the near-infrared wavelengths. Finally, SNe~Ia that explode beyond 10 kpc from their host centers exhibit smaller dispersion in their luminosity, confirming our earlier findings. Reduced effect of dust in the outskirt of hosts may be responsible for this effect.\n\n", "2308.01819": "2023-08-03, **Interacting supernovae from wide massive binary systems**, Andrea Ercolino et.al., [2308.01819v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01819v1)\n\n Many supernovae (SNe) imply an interaction of the SN ejecta with matter (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. This suggests that many massive stars may undergo various degrees of envelope stripping shortly before exploding, and produce a considerable diversity in their pre-explosion CSM properties. We explore a generic set of ~100 detailed massive binary evolution models to characterize the amount of envelope stripping and the expected CSM configurations. Our binary models were computed with the MESA stellar evolution code, considering an initial primary star mass of 12.6 Msun, and focus on initial orbital periods above 500 d. We compute these models up to the time of the primary's iron core collapse. We find that Roche lobe overflow often leads to incomplete stripping of the mass donor, resulting in a large variety of pre-SN envelope masses. Many of our models' red supergiant (RSG) donors undergo core collapse during Roche lobe overflow, with mass transfer and thus system mass loss rates of up to 0.01 Msun/yr at that time. The corresponding CSM densities are similar to those inferred for Type IIn SNe like 1998S. In other cases, the mass transfer turns unstable, leading to a common envelope phase at such late time that the mass donor explodes before the common envelope is fully ejected or the system has merged. We argue that this may cause significant pre-SN variability, as for example in SN 2020tlf. Other models suggest a common envelope ejection just centuries before core collapse, which may lead to the strongest interactions, as in superluminous Type IIn SNe like 1994W, or 2006gy. Wide massive binaries offer a natural framework to understand a broad range of hydrogen-rich interacting SNe. On the other hand, the flash features observed in many Type IIP SNe, like in SN 2013fs, may indicate that RSGs are more extended than currently assumed.\n\n", "2308.01111": "2023-08-02, **Observational constraints on the origin of the elements. VI. Origin and evolution of neutron-capture elements as probed by the Gaia-ESO survey**, Jianhui Lian et.al., [2308.01111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01111v1)\n\n Most heavy elements beyond the iron peak are synthesized via neutron capture processes. The nature of the astrophysical sites of neutron capture processes is still very unclear. In this work we explore the observational constraints of the chemical abundances of s-process and r-process elements on the sites of neutron-capture processes by applying Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models to the data from Gaia-ESO large spectroscopic stellar survey. For the r-process, the [Eu/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution suggests a short delay time of the site that produces Eu. Other independent observations (e.g., NS-NS binaries), however, suggest a significant fraction of long delayed ($>1$Gyr) neutron star mergers (NSM). When assuming NSM as the only r-process sites, these two observational constraints are inconsistent at above 1$\\sigma$ level. Including short delayed r-process sites like magneto-rotational supernova can resolve this inconsistency. For the s-process, we find a weak metallicity dependence of the [Ba/Y] ratio, which traces the s-process efficiency. Our GCE model with up-to-date yields of AGB stars qualitatively reproduces this metallicity dependence, but the model predicts a much higher [Ba/Y] ratio compared to the data. This mismatch suggests that the s-process efficiency of low mass AGB stars in the current AGB nucleosynthesis models could be overestimated.\n\n", "2308.00804": "2023-08-02, **Gravitationally induced matter creation and cosmological consequences**, Trishit Banerjee et.al., [2308.00804v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00804v1)\n\n In this work, a two-fluid interacting model in a flat FLRW universe has been studied considering particle creation mechanism with a particular form of particle creation rate $\\Gamma=\\Gamma\\_0 H+\\frac{\\Gamma\\_1}{H}$ from different aspects. Statistical analysis with a combined data set of SNe Ia (Supernovae Type Ia) and Hubble data is performed to achieve the best-fit values of the model parameters, and the model is compatible with current observational data. We also perform a dynamical analysis of this model to get an overall qualitative description of the cosmological evolution by converting the governing equations into a system of ordinary differential equations considering a proper transformation of variables. We find some non-isolated sets of critical points, among which some usually are normally hyperbolic sets of points that describe the present acceleration of the Universe dominated by dark energy mimicking cosmological constant or phantom fluid. Scaling solutions are also obtained from this analysis, and they can alleviate the coincidence problem successfully. Finally, the thermodynamic analysis shows that the Generalized second law of thermodynamics is valid in an irreversible thermodynamic context.\n\n", "2308.00996": "2023-08-02, **Spectropolarimetry of Type II supernovae (II) Intrinsic supernova polarization and its relations with the photometric/spectroscopic properties**, T. Nagao et.al., [2308.00996v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00996v1)\n\n The explosion processes of supernovae (SNe) are imprinted in their explosion geometries. Here, we study the intrinsic polarization of 15 hydrogen-rich core-collapse SNe and explore the relation with the photometric and spectroscopic properties. Our sample shows diverse properties of the continuum polarization. The polarization of most SNe has a low degree at early phases but shows a sudden rise to $\\sim 1$ \\% degree at certain points during the photospheric phase as well as a slow decline during the tail phase, with a constant polarization angle. The variation in the timing of peak polarisation values implies diversity in the explosion geometry: some SNe have aspherical structures only in their helium cores, while in other SNe these reach out to a significant part of the outer hydrogen envelope with a common axis from the helium core to the hydrogen envelope. Other SNe show high polarization from early phases and a change of the polarization angle around the middle of the photospheric phase. This implies that the ejecta are significantly aspherical to the outermost layer and have multi-directional aspherical structures. Exceptionally, the Type~IIL SN~2017ahn shows low polarization at both the photospheric and tail phases. Our results show that the timing of the polarization rise in Type~IIP SNe is likely correlated with their brightness, velocity and the amount of radioactive Ni produced: brighter SNe with faster ejecta velocity and a larger $^{56}$Ni mass have more extended-aspherical explosion geometries. In particular, there is a clear correlation between the timing of the polarization rise and the explosion energy, that is, the explosion asphericity is proportional to the explosion energy. This implies that the development of a global aspherical structure, e.g., a jet, might be the key to realising an energetic SN in the mechanism of SN explosions.\n\n", "2308.00916": "2023-08-02, **Cosmological Distance Measurement of 12 Nearby Supernovae IIP with ROTSE-IIIB**, Govinda Dhungana et.al., [2308.00916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00916v1)\n\n We present cosmological analysis of 12 nearby ($z<0.06$) Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) observed with the ROTSE-IIIb telescope. To achieve precise photometry, we present a new image differencing technique that is implemented for the first time on the ROTSE SN photometry pipeline. With this method, we find up to a 20\\% increase in the detection efficiency and significant reduction in residual RMS scatter of the SN lightcurves when compared to the previous pipeline performance. We use the published optical spectra and broadband photometry of well studied SNe IIP to establish temporal models for ejecta velocity and photospheric temperature evolution for our SNe IIP population. This study yields measurements that are competitive to other methods even when the data are limited to a single epoch during the photospheric phase of SNe IIP. Using the fully reduced ROTSE photometry and optical spectra, we apply these models to the respective photometric epochs for each SN in the ROTSE IIP sample. This facilitates the use of the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) to obtain distance estimates to their respective host galaxies. We then perform cosmological parameter fitting using these EPM distances from which we measure the Hubble constant to be $72.9^{+5.7}\\_{-4.3}~{\\rm kms^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, which is consistent with the standard $\\Lambda CDM$ model values derived using other independent techniques.\n\n"}}
