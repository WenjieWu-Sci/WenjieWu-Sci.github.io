We study SBND's sensitivity to the weak mixing angle using neutrino-electron scattering events. We perform a detailed simulation, paying particular attention to background rejection and estimating the detector response. We find that SBND can provide a reasonable constraint on the weak mixing angle, achieving 8% precision for $10^{21}$ protons on target, assuming an overall flux normalization uncertainty of 10%.

Upcoming CMB spectrum measurements, such as those underway at the Simons Observatory, will achieve unprecedented precision, allowing for more accurate extraction of information about the properties of the primordial plasma and, in particular, primordial neutrinos. This provides an opportunity to test whether these properties align with the predictions of the standard cosmological model or indicate the presence of new physics that influenced the evolution of the MeV-temperature plasma. A key component in understanding how new physics may have affected primordial neutrinos is solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving this equation that offers model independence, transparency, and computational efficiency - features that current state-of-the-art methods lack. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation and apply it to several toy scenarios, showcasing key aspects of the primordial plasma's evolution in the presence of new physics.\n\n", "2409.07184": "2024-09-11, **Muon anomalous magnetic moment and Right handed sterile neutrino**, Iman Motie et.al., [2409.07184v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07184v1)\n\n The muon's magnetic moment is a fundamental quantity in particle physics and the deviation of its value from quantum electrodynamics (QED), motivates research beyond the standard models (SM). In this study, we utilize the effective coupling of right-handed sterile neutrinos with SM gauge bosons to calculate the muon anomalous magnetic moment ($\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$AMM) at one-loop level. The contribution of the sterile neutrino interactions on the $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$AMM is calculated by considering the standard and non-standard neutrino interactions. Our results show that the standard sterile neutrino interactions give a negligible contribution to $\\Delta a\\_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}$ while the non-standard neutrino interactions can play a significant role in explaining the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly. In the context of the non-standard neutrino interaction, our calculation shows that a Dirac mass scale $M\\_D$ around $100\\,\\text{GeV}$ could explain the muon anomaly if the right handed sterile neutrino's coupling with SM particles is about $\\mathcal{G}\\_R\\approx 10^{-3}$.

In particular, neither the uncertainty in the energy resolution nor a systematic error in the energy response of a detector will lead to a correlation between bins. This is in contrast with a result that recently appeared in the literature, where it was claimed that the finite energy resolution could induce correlation between bins, changing the distribution of $\\Delta\\chi^2$ when attempting to determine the neutrino mass ordering using reactor neutrinos. We will compute the expression for the variance of $\\Delta\\chi^2$ in the case of non-nested hypotheses if correlations between bins are present, showing that they could indeed affect the distribution. We will also show, however, that the detector response cannot introduce statistical correlations between bins unless these are already present in the original spectrum. Both of these results are valid in general: the absence of correlation is true for any detector response and the distribution of $\\Delta\\chi^2$ in the presence of (intrinsic) correlations, while obtained having the mass ordering in mind, it is true for any non-nested hypotheses.\n\n", "2409.07120": "2024-09-11, **Experimental Summary of the Moriond 2024 conference -- Electroweak Interaction & Unified Theories**, Barbara Clerbaux et.al., [2409.07120v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07120v1)\n\n The proceeding gives a summary of the experimental results presented at the Moriond 2024 conference (electroweak interactions and unified theory session), focussing on the latest measurements.

The new gauge charge anomaly cancellation not only explains the existence of just three fermion generations as observed but also requires the presence of a unique right-handed neutrino $\\nu\\_R$ with a non-zero new gauge charge. Further, the new gauge charge breaking supplies a residual matter parity, under which the fundamental fermions and $\\nu\\_R$ are even, whereas a right-handed neutrino $N\\_R$ without the new charge is odd.

The spontaneous scalarization in the scalar-tensor gravity has been proposed for neutron stars. Here, we investigate the spontaneous scalarization in dark matter admixed neutron stars. Applying the dark matter equations of state, we calculate the structure of scalarized neutron stars containing dark matter. The dark matter equations of state are based on observational data from the rotational curves of galaxies and the fermionic self-interacting dark matter. Our results verify that the spontaneous scalarization is affected by the dark matter pressure in neutron stars. Depending on the central density of scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars, the dark matter pressure alters the central scalar field. The increase of dark matter pressure in low-density scalarized stars amplifies the central scalar field. However, the pressure of dark matter in high-density scalarized stars suppresses the central scalar field. Our calculations confirm that the stars in the merger event GW170817 and in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 can be scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars.\n\n", "2409.07290": "2024-09-11, **PSZ2 G282.28+49.94, a recently discovered analogue of the famous Bullet Cluster**, I.

The intracluster medium (ICM) of this object at z=0.56 exhibits a cometary-like shape. Combining Chandra and TNG observations, we characterised the spatially resolved thermodynamical properties of the gas and the spatial and velocity distribution of 73 galaxy members. The cluster structure is quite complex with an elongated core region containing the two brightest cluster galaxies and one dense group to the south-east. Since there is no velocity difference between the core and the south-east group, we suggest the presence of a merger along the plane of the sky. This structure is related to complex X-ray and radio features, and thus the merger has likely been caught during the post-merger phase. Comparing the distribution of the ICM and of member galaxies, we find a large offset of $\\sim 350$ kpc between the position of the X-ray peak and the centre of a concentration of galaxies, preceding it in the likely direction of motion. This configuration is similar to the famous Bullet Cluster, leading us to dub PSZ2 G282.28+49.94 the \"Planck bullet\", and represents an ideal situation to provide astrophysical constraints to the self-interaction cross-section ($\\sigma/m$) of dark matter particles.

Previous work on this case determined that the scalar field is given by a simple expression of the Lambert W function in terms of the easily observable scale factor. This expression provides analytic equations for the evolution of cosmological dark energy parameters as a function of the scale factor for all points on the Lambert W function principal branch. The Lambert W function is zero at a scale factor of zero that marks the big bang. The evolutionary equations beyond the big bang describe a canonical universe that is similar to {\\Lambda}CDM, making it an excellent dynamical template to compare with observational data. The portion of the W function principal before the big bang extends to the infinite pre-bang past. It describes a noncanonical universe with an initially very low mass density that contracts by rolling down the dark energy potential to a singularity, big bang, at the scale factor zero point. This provides a natural origin for the big bang. It also raises the possibility that the universe existed before the big bang and is far older, and that it was once far larger than its current size. The recent increasing interest in the possibility of a dynamical universe instead of {\\Lambda}CDM makes the exploration of the nature of such universes particularly relevant.\n\n", "2409.06783": "2024-09-10, **Supermassive black hole feedback quenches disc galaxies and suppresses bar formation in TNG50**, Matthew Frosst et.al., [2409.06783v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06783v1)\n\n We use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 to study the relationship between black hole feedback, the presence of stellar bars, and star formation quenching in Milky Way-like disc galaxies. Of our sample of 198 discs, about 63 per cent develop stellar bars that last until z=0. After the formation of their bars, the majority of these galaxies develop persistent 3-15 kpc wide holes in the centres of their gas discs. Tracking their evolution from z=4 to 0, we demonstrate that barred galaxies tend to form within dark matter haloes that become centrally disc dominated early on (and are thus unstable to bar formation) whereas unbarred galaxies do not; barred galaxies also host central black holes that grow more rapidly than those of unbarred galaxies. As a result, most barred galaxies eventually experience kinetic wind feedback that operates when the mass of the central supermassive black hole exceeds $M\\_{BH} > 10^8 M\\_{\\odot}$. This feedback ejects gas from the central disc into the circumgalactic medium and rapidly quenches barred galaxies of their central star formation. If kinetic black hole feedback occurs in an unbarred disc it suppresses subsequent star formation and inhibits its growth, stabilising the disc against future bar formation. Consequently, most barred galaxies develop black hole-driven gas holes, though a gas hole alone does not guarantee the presence of a stellar bar. This subtle relationship between black hole feedback, cold gas disc morphology, and stellar bars may provide constraints on subgrid physics models for supermassive black hole feedback.\n\n", "2409.06771": "2024-09-10, **Searching for Dark Matter Interactions with ACT, SPT and DES**, Zilu Zhou et.al., [2409.06771v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06771v1)\n\n Models of a dark radiation sector with a mass threshold (WZDR+) have proved to be an appealing alternative to $\\Lambda$CDM.

We expand our analyses to include a wide set of data, including the ACT-DR6 lensing data, as well as primary CMB information from ACT-DR4 and SPT-3G, scale-dependent power spectra from DES and measurements of $H\\_0$ from SH0ES. We find that there is little to no tension in measurements of structure within the data sets, and the inferred value of $S\\_8$ is generally lower than that in $\\Lambda$CDM.

Here we present a simple analytical model to generate a population of MBHB mergers based on a theoretical prescription that connects them to DM halo mergers. The high flexibility of our approach allows us to explore the broad and uncertain range of MBH seeding and growth mechanisms, as well as the different effects behind the interplay between MBH and galactic astrophysics. Such a flexibility is fundamental for the successful implementation and optimisation of the hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation approach that here we apply to the MBHB population of LISA for the first time. Our inferred population hyper-parameters are chosen as proxies to characterise the MBH--DM halo mass scaling relation, the occupation fraction of MBHs in DM halos and the delay between halo and MBHB mergers. We find that LISA will provide tight constraints at the lower-end of the MBH-halo scaling relation, well complementing EM observations which are biased towards large masses. Furthermore, our results suggest that LISA will constrain some features of the MBH occupation fraction at high redshift, as well as merger time delays of the order of a few hundreds of Myr, opening the possibility to constrain dynamical evolution time scales such as the dynamical friction.

Since the gravitational wave is relativistic, there is an additional enhancement of the signal compared to the axion case due to increased conversion probability of gravitational waves to photons in the vacuum between the disks. A gravitational wave search using a dielectric haloscope imposes stringent requirements on the disk thickness and placement, but relaxed requirements on the disk smoothness. An advantage is the possibility of a broadband or hybrid resonant/broadband operation mode, which extends the frequency range down to $\\mathcal{O}(100\\,\\text{MHz})$.

However, its validity was recently questioned, and the lifetime of a black hole is conjectured to be much extended by the memory burden effect. It gives rise to the possibility that the primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^{10}$ grams are the dark matter in the Universe.

The first phase is dominated by star formation, with its duration primarily determined by the mass of the SMBH seed and the surrounding gas environment. The second phase is characterized by rapid SMBH growth, and the transition to the next phase occurs when the thermal-mode feedback of active galactic nucleus (AGN) can unbind gas from the galaxy. The third phase involves self-regulation of the SMBH, and the transition to the quenched phase occurs when the kinetic-mode feedback of AGN counterbalances gas cooling within the subhalo.

In this work, the neutron star consisting of nucleons and leptons, and the hyperonic star including the hyperons will be studied in the framework of the density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) model. Some popular DDRMF parameterizations will be adopted to investigate the properties of nuclear matter and the mass, radius, tidal deformability, and other properties of neutron star and hyperonic stars.

The pipeline involves two stages: (1) a representation learning stage, consisting of a convolutional autoencoder that feeds on imagery from infrared and radio continuum surveys (WISE 22$\\mu$m, Hi-GAL 70 $\\mu$m and SMGPS 30 cm) and produces a compact representation in a lower-dimensionality latent space; and (2) a clustering stage that seeks meaningful clusters in the latent space that can be linked to the physical properties of the SNRs and their surroundings. Our results suggest that this approach, when combined with an intermediate uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) reprojection of the autoencoded embeddings into a more clusterable manifold, enables us to find reliable clusters. Despite a large number of sources being classified as outliers, most clusters relate to the presence of distinctive features, such as the distribution of infrared emission, the presence of radio shells and pulsar wind nebulae, and the existence of dust filaments.\n\n", "2409.06352": "2024-09-10, **A potential mass-gap black hole in a wide binary with a circular orbit**, Wang Song et.al., [2409.06352v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06352v1)\n\n Mass distribution of black holes identified through X-ray emission suggests a paucity of black holes in the mass range of 3 to 5 solar masses. Modified theories have been devised to explain this mass gap, and it is suggested that natal kicks during supernova explosion can more easily disrupt binaries with lower mass black holes. Although recent LIGO observations reveal the existence of compact remnants within this mass gap, the question of whether low-mass black holes can exist in binaries remains a matter of debate. Such a system is expected to be noninteracting without X-ray emission, and can be searched for using radial velocity and astrometric methods. Here we report Gaia DR3 3425577610762832384, a wide binary system including a red giant star and an unseen object, exhibiting an orbital period of approximately 880 days and near-zero eccentricity. Through the combination of radial velocity measurements from LAMOST and astrometric data from Gaia DR2 and DR3 catalogs, we determine a mass of $3.6^{+0.8}\\_{-0.5}$ $M\\_{\\odot}$ of the unseen component. This places the unseen companion within the mass gap, strongly suggesting the existence of binary systems containing low-mass black holes. More notably, the formation of its surprisingly wide circular orbit challenges current binary evolution and supernova explosion theories.\n\n"}}
