No statistically significant neutrino emission was found in any of the catalog searches.

We develop a general method using minimum square statistics that can compute the sensitivity to any variable affecting neutrino time of flight. We apply this method in two different situations: First, we compare the time spectrum changes due to different neutrino mass values to put limits in electron (anti)neutrino effective mass. Second, we constrain Lorentz Invariance Violation through the mass scale, $M\\_{QG}$, at which it would occur. We consider two main neutrino detection techniques: 1. DUNE-like liquid argon TPC, for which the main detection channel is $\\nu\\_e +\\, ^{40}\\mbox{Ar} \\rightarrow e^- +\\, ^{40}\\mbox{K}^*$, related to the supernova neutronization burst, and 2.

We study the requirements the model's parameters have to fulfill in order to reproduce the measured DM relic abundance through two possible production mechanisms in the early universe, freeze-in and misalignment, both during a standard radiation-dominated era and early matter domination. We then study possible signals of type-II majoron DM and the present and expected constraints on the parameter space that can be obtained from cosmological observations, direct detection experiments, and present and future searches for decaying DM at neutrino telescopes and cosmic-ray experiments. We find that -- depending on the majoron mass, the production mechanism, and the value of the vacuum expectation value of the type-II triplet -- all of the three decay modes (photons, electrons, neutrinos) of majoron DM particles can yield observable signals at future indirect searches for DM.

We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding dark-matter-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the \"fixed & paired\" variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales.

It is found that the emission of a non-standard second neutrino burst, dominated by electron-antineutrinos, is not only a measurable signal for the appearance of deconfined quark matter but also reveals information about the state of matter at extreme conditions encountered at the supernova interior. To this end, a large set of spherically symmetric supernova models is investigated, studying the dependence on the equation of state and on the stellar progenitor. General relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics is employed featuring three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport and a microscopic hadron-quark hybrid matter equation of state class, that covers a representative range of parameters. This facilitates the direct connection between intrinsic signatures of the neutrino signal and properties of the equation of state. In particular, a set of novel relations have been found empirically.

The sample includes significant improvements in data calibration, detector simulation, and data processing, and the analysis benefits from a detailed treatment of systematic uncertainties, with significantly higher level of detail since our last study.

In particular, AmBe sources are used to calibrate neutron tagging by selecting the 4438-keV $\\gamma$-ray signal, which is simultaneously emitted with a neutron signal. Therefore, analyzing the neutron and $\\gamma$-ray emission properties of AmBe sources is crucial.

We used an AmBe source to measure the energy spectra of simultaneously emitted neutrons and $\\gamma$-rays and determine the emission ratio of the neutrons with and without $\\gamma$-ray emission. The measured spectrum was consistent with that obtained from the simulated result, whereas the measured emission ratio was significantly different from the corresponding simulated result.

To further assess this possibility, since the inferred dark matter distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.\n\n", "2304.12613": "2023-04-25, **Can a variation of Fine Structure Constant influence the fate of Gravitational Collapse?**, Soumya Chakrabarti et.al., [2304.12613v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12613v1)\n\n We show that it is possible to steer clear of a spacetime singularity during gravitational collapse by considering the time-variation of a fundamental coupling, in this case, the fine structure constant {\\alpha}. We study a spherical distribution of cold dark matter coexisting with other fluid elements, collapsing under its own gravity. Dark matter is written as a scalar field interacting with electrically charged matter. This leads to a time variation of {\\alpha} and as a consequence, a breakdown of local charge conservation within the sphere. The exterior has no such field and therefore, Einstein's GR and standard equivalence principles remain valid. We derive the lowest possible bound on the collapse of this sphere beyond which there is a bounce and dispersal of most of the accumulated matter.

It was found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g, still in agreement with CMB observations.

In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $\\xi$. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution.

Sensitive methods to identify the IA signal will therefore need to be included in the upcoming weak lensing analysis pipelines. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations allow us to directly measure the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and thus provide a powerful approach to predict and understand the IA signal.

Dark matter that is thermally produced during an era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to generate the observed dark matter relic abundance. Furthermore, dark matter density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the resulting enhancement to the small-scale matter power spectrum increases the microhalo abundance and boosts the dark matter annihilation rate. We then use gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal dark matter production during kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum. Therefore, observational limits on the dark matter annihilation rate imply a minimum cutoff scale for a given dark matter particle mass and kination scenario. For dark matter that was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic decoupling temperature for the dark matter. This bound on the decoupling temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot appreciably boost the dark matter annihilation rate if dark matter was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n\n", "2304.12210": "2023-04-24, **A Cookbook of Self-Supervised Learning**, Randall Balestriero et.al., [2304.12210v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12210v1)\n\n Self-supervised learning, dubbed the dark matter of intelligence, is a promising path to advance machine learning.

We compute the chemical enrichment of Eu occurring in the building blocks that have possibly formed the Galactic halo. In this framework, the enrichment from neutron star mergers can be influenced by the dynamics of the binary systems in the gravitational potential of the original host galaxy. In the least massive systems, the neutron stars can merge outside the host galaxy and so only a small fraction of newly produced Eu can be retained by the parent galaxy itself.\\\\ Results.

The blue slope of the polarized continuum during the first month, accompanied by short-lived polarized flux for Balmer emission, suggests that an aspherical distribution of dust grains in pre-shock circumstellar material (CSM) is echoing the SN IIn spectrum and strongly influencing the polarization, while the subsequent decline during the wavelength-independent phase appears broadly consistent with electron scattering near the SN/CSM interface. The persistence of the polarization position angle between these two phases suggests that the pre-existing CSM responsible for the dust scattering at early times is part of the same geometric structure as the electron-scattering region that dominates the polarization at later times. SN2017hcc appears to be yet another, but much more extreme, case of aspherical yet well-ordered CSM in Type IIn SNe, possibly resulting from pre-SN mass loss shaped by a binary progenitor system.\n\n", "2304.12361": "2023-04-24, **SN 2020udy: a SN Iax with strict limits on interaction consistent with a helium-star companion**, Kate Maguire et.al., [2304.12361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12361v1)\n\n Early observations of transient explosions can provide vital clues to their progenitor origins. In this paper we present the nearby Type Iax (02cx-like) supernova (SN), SN 2020udy that was discovered within hours ($\\sim$7 hr) of estimated first light. An extensive dataset of ultra-violet, optical, and near-infrared observations was obtained, covering out to $\\sim$150 d after explosion. SN 2020udy peaked at -17.86$\\pm$0.43 mag in the r band and evolved similarly to other 'luminous' SNe Iax, such as SNe 2005hk and 2012Z. Its well-sampled early light curve allows strict limits on companion interaction to be placed. Main-sequence companion stars with masses of 2 and 6 M$\\_\\odot$ are ruled out at all viewing angles, while a helium-star companion is allowed from a narrow range of angles (140-180$^\\circ$ away from the companion). The spectra and light curves of SN2020udy are in good agreement with those of the 'N5def' deflagration model of a near Chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf. However, as has been seen in previous studies of similar luminosity events, SN 2020udy evolves slower than the model. Broad-band linear polarisation measurements taken at and after peak are consistent with no polarisation, in agreement with the predictions of the companion-star configuration from the early light curve measurements. The host galaxy environment is low metallicity and is consistent with a young stellar population. Overall, we find the most plausible explosion scenario to be the incomplete disruption of a CO white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar-mass limit, with a helium-star companion.\n\n", "2304.12358": "2023-04-24, **Evidence for two distinct populations of kilonova-associated Gamma Ray Bursts**, Dimple et.al., [2304.12358v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12358v1)\n\n Identification of Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) progenitors based on the duration of their prompt emission ($T\\_{90}$) has faced several roadblocks recently. Long-duration GRBs (with $T\\_{90} > 2s$) have traditionally been thought to be originating from the collapse of massive stars, and the short-duration ones (with $T\\_{90} < 2s$) from compact binary mergers. However, recent observations of a long GRB associated with a kilonova (KN) and a short GRB with supernova (SN) association demand a more detailed classification of the GRB population. In this {\\it Letter}, we focus on GRBs associated with KNe, believed to be originating from mergers of binaries involving neutron stars (NS). We make use of the GRB prompt emission light curves of {\\it Swift}-BAT 2022 GRB catalog and employ machine learning algorithms to study the classification of GRB progenitors. Our analysis reveals that there are five distinct clusters of GRBs, of which the KN-associated GRBs are located in two separate clusters indicating they may have been produced by different progenitors. We argue that these clusters may be due to subclasses of binary neutron star (BNS) and/or neutron star--black hole (NS-BH) mergers. We also discuss the implications of these findings for future gravitational-wave (GW) observations and how those observations may help in understanding these clusters better.\n\n", "2304.12291": "2023-04-24, **Evolution of open clusters with or without black holes**, B. Shukirgaliyev et.al., [2304.12291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12291v1)\n\n Binary black holes (BHs) can be formed dynamically in the centers of star clusters. The high natal kicks for stellar-mass BHs used in previous works made it hard to retain BHs in star clusters. Recent studies of massive star evolution and supernovae (SN) propose kick velocities that are lower due to the fallback of the SN ejecta. We study the impact of these updates by performing $N$-body simulations following instantaneous gas expulsion. For comparison, we simulate two additional model sets with the previous treatment of stars: one with high kicks and another with artificial removal of the kicks. Our model clusters initially consist of about one hundred thousand stars, formed with centrally-peaked efficiency. We find that the updated treatment of stars, due to the fallback-scaled lower natal kicks, allows clusters to retain SN remnants after violent relaxation. The mass contribution of the retained remnants does not exceed a few percent of the total bound cluster mass during the early evolution. For this reason, the first giga year of evolution is not affected significantly by this effect. Nevertheless, during the subsequent long-term evolution, the retained BHs accelerate mass segregation, leading to the faster dissolution of the clusters.\n\n", "2304.11819": "2023-04-24, **Progenitor constraint with circumstellar material for the magnetar-hosting supernova remnant RCW 103**, Takuto Narita et.al., [2304.11819v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11819v1)\n\n Stellar winds blown out from massive stars ($\\gtrsim 10M\\_{\\odot}$) contain precious information on the progenitor itself, and in this context, the most important elements are carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O), which are produced by the CNO cycle in the H-burning layer. Although their X-ray fluorescence lines are expected to be detected in swept-up shock-heated circumstellar materials (CSMs) in supernova remnants (SNRs), particularly those of C and N have been difficult to detect so far. Here, we present a high-resolution spectroscopy of a young magnetar-hosting SNR RCW~103 with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) onboard XMM-Newton and report on the detection of \\ion{N}{7} Ly$\\alpha$ (0.50~keV) line for the first time. By comparing the obtained abundance ratio of N to O (N/O$=3.8 \\pm{0.1}$) with various stellar evolution models, we show that the progenitor of RCW~103 is likely to have a low-mass (10--12~$M\\_{\\odot}$) and medium-rotation velocities ($\\lesssim 100~\\rm{km~s^{-1}}$). The results also rule out the possibility of dynamo effects in massive ($\\geq35~M\\_{\\odot}$) stars as a formation mechanism of the associated magnetar 1E~161348$-$5055. Our method is useful for estimating various progenitor parameters for future missions with microcalorimeters such as XRISM and Athena.\n\n"}}
