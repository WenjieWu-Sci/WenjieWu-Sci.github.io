Our analysis is entirely based on a phase space framework that allows us to keep track of the axion distribution in momentum space across the entire expansion history. First, we consider flavor-diagonal couplings to charged leptons and quantify the expected amount of dark radiation as a function of the coupling strength. Leptophilic axions are immune from complications due to strong interactions and our predictions do not suffer from theoretical uncertainties. We then focus on flavor-diagonal interactions with the three heavier quarks whose masses are all above the scale where strong interactions become non-perturbative. The top quark case is rather safe because its mass is orders of magnitude above the confinement scale, and the consequent predictions are solid. The bottom and charm masses are in more dangerous territory because they are very close to the QCD crossover. We present a comprehensive discussion of theoretical uncertainties due to both the choice of the scale where we stop the Boltzmann evolution and the running of QCD parameters. Finally, we compute the predicted amount of dark radiation expressed as an effective number of additional neutrino species. We compare our predictions with the ones obtained via standard approximate procedures, and we find that adopting a rigorous phase space framework alters the prediction by an amount larger than the sensitivity of future CMB observatories.\n\n", "2410.21137": "2024-10-28, **Search for excited tau leptons in the $\u03c4\u03c4\u03b3$ final state in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV**, CMS Collaboration et.al., [2410.21137v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21137v1)\n\n Results are presented for a test of the compositeness of the heaviest charged lepton, $\\tau$, using data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the CERN LHC. The data were collected in 2016-2018 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. This analysis searches for tau lepton pair production in which one of the tau leptons is produced in an excited state and decays to a ground state tau lepton and a photon. The event selection consists of two isolated tau lepton decay candidates and a high-energy photon. The mass of the excited tau lepton is reconstructed using the missing transverse momentum in the event, assuming the momentum of the neutrinos from each tau lepton decay are aligned with the visible decay products. No excess of events above the standard model background prediction is observed. This null result is used to set lower bounds on the excited tau lepton mass. For a compositeness scale $\\Lambda$ equal to the excited tau lepton mass, excited tau leptons with masses below 4700 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level; for $\\Lambda$ = 10 TeV this exclusion is set at 2800 GeV.

We show that, with neutrino-electron inelastic scattering, simulations predict 75% higher disc mass with slightly different mass-averaged compositions, and 18% more ejected mass with similar distributions. The enhancement of the mass of the disc and the ejecta results in stronger baryon pollution, leading to less favourable jet launching environments. Furthermore, neutrino luminosities are about 50, 40, and 30% higher for electron neutrino, electron anti-neutrino, and heavy-lepton neutrinos.

Scott et.al., [2410.21221v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21221v1)\n\n Optical observations of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs) show they typically have high specific star formation rates and low metallicites. A subset of these galaxies (those with the lowest gas phase metallicities) display cometary optical morphologies similar to those found at high redshift. Whether this combination of properties predominantly arises from interactions with neighbours or accretion from the cosmic web or something else remains unclear. We used high resolution HI mapping to gain insights into the processes driving the observed properties of a sample of extremely metal poor (XMP) BCDs. We present Very Large Array B- and C-configuration HI mapping of four BCDs. For three of the targeted BCDs we also detect and map the HI in their nearby companions. In these three cases there is HI evidence for a recent flyby interaction between the BCD and a nearby companion. The HI evidence for recent interactions for these three BCDs is corroborated by our analysis of the tidal forces exerted on the BCDs by companions with available spectroscopic redshifts. For J0204-1009 we had sufficient spatial resolution to determine that it is dark matter dominated and estimate its DM halo mass to be in the range 1.2 x 10^11 to 5.2 x 10^11 solar masses. It is the most isolated BCD in our small sample, J0301-0052, which shows one of the most asymmetric HI morphologies. J0301-0052 has a similar cometary HI morphology to the BCD's optical morphology, although the HI column density maximum is projected at the end of the of the optical tail. Our HI observations suggest J0301-0052 may be undergoing a merger, while the other BCDs show evidence of a recent tidal interaction with a near neighbour. While our selection criteria favoured BCDs with companions our results are consistent with the earlier finding by other authors that most BCDs are associated with either mild tidal interactions or mergers.\n\n", "2410.21174": "2024-10-28, **$\\texttt{StreamSculptor}$: Hamiltonian Perturbation Theory for Stellar Streams in Flexible Potentials with Differentiable Simulations**, Jacob Nibauer et.al., [2410.21174v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21174v1)\n\n Stellar streams retain a memory of their gravitational interactions with small-scale perturbations. While perturbative models for streams have been formulated in action-angle coordinates, a direct transformation to these coordinates is only available for static and typically axisymmetric models for the galaxy. The real Milky Way potential is in a state of disequilibrium, complicating the application of perturbative methods around an equilibrium system. Here, we utilize a combination of differentiable simulations and Hamiltonian perturbation theory to model the leading-order effect of dark matter subhalos on stream observables. To obtain a perturbative description of streams, we develop a direct and efficient forward mode differentiation of Hamilton's equations of motion. Our model operates in observable coordinates, allowing us to treat the effects of arbitrary subhalo potentials on streams perturbatively, while simultaneously capturing non-linear effects due to other substructures like the infalling LMC or the rotating bar. The model predicts the velocity dispersion of streams as a function of subhalo statistics, allowing us to constrain the low-mass range of subhalos down to $\\sim 10^5~M\\_\\odot$. We forecast the velocity dispersion of the GD-1 stream, and find that observations are in agreement with a CDM subhalo population, with a slight preference for more dense subhalos. The method provides a new approach to characterize streams in the presence of substructure, with significantly more modeling flexibility compared to previous works.\n\n", "2410.21089": "2024-10-28, **New constraints on singlet scalar dark matter model with LZ, invisible Higgs decay and gamma-ray line observations**, Yang Yu et.al., [2410.21089v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21089v1)\n\n The singlet scalar dark matter (DM) model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM).

In this contribution, the effect of impurities on the triplet lifetime is analyzed for individual events using DS-50 data, with a primary focus on nitrogen, one of the candidates for the impurities in LAr hypothesized to cause a suppression of triplet lifetime.

We study in detail the $f$-mode spectra within the Cowling approximation by obtaining the frequencies as a function of mass, compactness and $\\Lambda$ of the star. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of DMSQSs. Our investigation indicates that the presence of DM and its interaction with SQM has great impact on the $f$-modes. We show that the $f$-mode frequencies are larger for DMSQSs, which are largely populated with massive DM fermions, compared to the SQSs. Further, we obtain a linear empirical relation between the $f$-modes and the average density of the star. We also find that the mass-scaled angular frequency varies universally with compactness for DMSQSs.\n\n", "2410.20736": "2024-10-28, **Non-minimal coupling of scalar fields in the dark sector and generalization of the top-hat collapse**, Priyanka Saha et.al., [2410.20736v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20736v1)\n\n In this article, we propose a new way to handle interactions between two scalar fields in the cosmological backdrop where one scalar field oscillates rapidly in the cosmological time scale while the other does not show any periodic behavior in the same time scale. We have interpreted the rapidly oscillating scalar field as the dark matter candidate while the other scalar field is supposed to be the canonical quintessence field or the non-canonical phantom field. A model of a generalized top-hat-like collapse is developed where the dark sector is composed of the aforementioned scalar fields.

Only a few works investigated the cluster-lensed sBBH mergers by adopting oversimplified models, while galaxy-lensed ones were intensively studied. In this paper, we estimate the detection rate of cluuster-lensed sBBH mergers with the third-generation GW detectors and its dependence on the lens models. We adopt detailed modeling of galaxy cluster lenses by using the mock clusters in the Synthetic Sky Catalog for Dark Energy Science with LSST (CosmoDC2) and/or approximations of the pseudo-Jaffe profile or an eccentric Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo plus a bright central galaxy with singular isothermal sphere profile. Considering the formation of sBBH mergers dominates by the channel of evolution of massive binary stars (EMBS), we find that the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBHs is $\\sim5-84$ yr$^{-1}$, depending on the adopted lens model and uncertainty in the merger rate density, and it is about $\\sim{13\\_{-2.0}^{+28}}$yr$^{-1}$ if adopting relatively more realistic galaxy clusters with central main and member galaxies in the CosmoDC2 catalog, close to the estimated detection rate of sBBH mergers lensed by galaxies. In addition, we also consider the case that the production of sBBH mergers dominated by the dynamical interactions in dense stellar systems. We find that the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBHs if from the dynamical channel is about $1.5$ times larger than that from the EMBS channel and the redshift distribution of former peaking at a higher redshift ($\\sim3$) compared with that from latter ($\\sim2$).\n\n", "2410.20645": "2024-10-28, **Direct detection of Higgs portal for light self-interacting dark matter**, Wu-Long Xu et.al., [2410.20645v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20645v1)\n\n Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can address the small-scale anomalies and previous researches focused on such a SIDM heavier than GeV, for which the self-scattering cross-section is in the quantum resonance region and has a non-trivial velocity dependence.

In this work, considering the constraints from CMB, BBN and the DM relic density, we investigate the direct detection of the Higgs portal for a sub-GeV SIDM with a scalar mediator. For this end, we consider two approaches : one is the cosmic-ray accelerated dark matter (CRDM) scattering off the nucleon, the other is the electron recoil caused by the halo dark matter. We present direct detection limits for the parameter space of light SIDM and scalar mediator. We find that the detectability in either approach needs a sizable mediator-Higgs mixing angle ($\\sin\\theta$) which is larger than one for the CRDM approach and larger than $10^{-3}$ for the electron recoil approach. While the former case cannot be realized in the Higgs-portal light SIDM model with a scalar mediator, the latter case may also be constrained by some astrophysical observations or beam dump experiment.

But producing full-physics hydrodynamical simulations of the most massive clusters is not an easy task. This would involve billions of computational elements to reliably resolve low mass galaxies similar to those measured in observations. On the other hand, dark matter only simulations of cluster size halos can be done with much larger mass resolution but at the cost of having to apply a model that populate galaxies within each of the subhalos in these simulations. In this paper we present the results of a new set of dark matter only simulations with different mass resolutions within the THE THREE HUNDRED project.

Many of these models are computed in 1-D to allow for an efficient way to account for the variability of properties of their local environment. However, small-scale simulations revealed that the release of energy from SNe within molecular clouds can be highly asymmetrical. This is largely due to the presence of pre-SN feedback, such as ionizing radiation, that are able to carve cavities and channels around the progenitors prior to their detonation. Being partially confined, the SN energy escapes into the outer ISM preferentially through these channels, departing from the spherically symmetric 1-D descriptions. To understand by how much the feedback output could differ, we present a theoretical model for a semi-confined SN. The problem concerns a SN expanding into an evolved HII region, bounded by a molecular cloud with pre-existing vents. With the aid of simple 3-D hydrodynamical simulations, we show that this mode of energy release increases the dynamical impact of the outflows, and extends the timescales over which the SN is energetically coupled to the surrounding matter. We also show that the amount of small-scale solenoidal turbulence driven by semi-confined SNe may be amplified.\n\n", "2410.21243": "2024-10-28, **Cosmological tests of quintessence in quantum gravity**, Sukannya Bhattacharya et.al., [2410.21243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21243v1)\n\n We use a suite of the most recent cosmological observations to test models of dynamical dark energy motivated by quantum gravity.

We then perform an analysis based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo to assess their predictions against CMB, galaxy surveys, and supernova data. We show to what extent current data can distinguish amongst different hilltop set-ups, providing model parameter constraints that are complementary to and synergetic with theoretical bounds from quantum gravity conjectures, as well as model comparisons across the main dark energy candidates in the literature.

The previous multi-wavelength (MWL) analysis on these two sources showed an important hadronic contribution at high energies.

Thus, the dichotomy in polarization between young and middle-aged SNRs (radial magnetic fields in young SNRs, but tangential magnetic fields in middle-aged SNRs), previously noticed in the radio band, deserves additional attention.

Intense accretion at Cosmic Dawn seeds strong turbulence, which reduces the local SFE for the same gas conditions due to turbulent pressure support.

In all cases, the original, unadulterated CSM structure is probed only at the onset of shock breakout, visible in high-resolution spectra as narrow, often blueshifted emission, possibly with an absorption trough. As the SN luminosity rises during breakout, radiative acceleration of the unshocked CSM starts, leading to a broadening of the ``narrow'' lines by ~100 and up to ~1000km/s, depending on CSM properties. This acceleration is maximum close to the shock, where the radiative flux is greater, and thus typically masked by optical-depth effects. Generally, narrow-line broadening is greater for more compact, tenuous CSM because of the proximity to the shock where the flux is born, and smaller in denser and more extended CSM. Narrow-line emission should show a broadening that slowly increases first (the line forms further out in the original wind), then sharply rises (the line forms in a region that is radiatively accelerated), before decreasing until late times (the line forms further away in regions more weakly accelerated). Radiative acceleration should inhibit X-ray emission during the early, IIn phase. Although high spectral resolution is critical at the earliest times to probe the original slow wind, radiative acceleration and associated line broadening may be captured with medium resolution allowing a simultaneous view of narrow, Doppler-broadened as well as extended, electron-scattering broadened line emission.\n\n", "2410.20415": "2024-10-27, **Mass-gap Black Holes in Coalescing Neutron Star Black Hole Binaries**, Zepei Xing et.al., [2410.20415v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20415v1)\n\n The existence of a mass gap of $3-5\\,M\\_{\\odot}$ between the heaviest neutron stars (NSs) and the lightest black holes (BHs), inferred from the BH mass distribution in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), has been suggested for decades. The recently reported gravitational-wave source GW230529 has been confidently identified as a NSBH merger, with the BH mass falling within this lower mass gap. This detection provides strong evidence against the existence of the latter and introduces new implications for the coalescing NSBH population, including a revised BH mass distribution and an updated local merger rate. In this study, we employ POSYDON, a binary population synthesis code that integrates detailed single- and binary-star models, to investigate coalescing NSBH binaries formed through isolated binary evolution. In particular, we focus on the BH mass distribution of the intrinsic NSBH merger population. We find that, with a high common-envelope efficiency of $\\alpha\\_{\\rm{CE}} =2 $, the BH masses in NSBH mergers concentrate in the lower mass gap, aligning more closely with observations. However, after accounting for the constraints of the selection bias against mass-gap BHs in LMXBs, which suggests that the maximum NS birth mass is below $\\simeq 2\\,M\\_{\\odot}$, we find that introducing a high $\\alpha\\_{\\rm{CE}}$ is not required to match observations. Additionally, we explore the impact of core-collapse supernova kicks. Finally, we present the property distributions of observable NSBH mergers from our simulation and find that they match well with the observations. We find that the fraction of electromagnetic counterparts in observable populations is $\\approx 4-30\\%$, depending on different NS equations of state. Future detections of coalescing NSBH binaries would provide invaluable insights into SN mechanisms, common envelope evolution, and NS physics.\n\n"}}
