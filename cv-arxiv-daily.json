To ensure the stability of the DM components, we impose a global $Z\\_2 \\times Z\\_2^\\prime$ symmetry. The lightest neutral states for both the scalar and fermion, which are non-trivially transformed under the extended symmetry, behave as stable two-component DM candidates. While single components are under-abundant due to their gauge interactions, in a mass region between $m\\_W$ and $525$ GeV for the scalar and a mass below $1200$ GeV for the fermion, and the fermion DM conflicts with direct detection limits over the whole parameter space, having two components helps to saturate relic density in the regions with under-abundance. Compliance with direct detection constraints leads to two options, either introducing dim-5 effective operators, or embedding the scenarios into a complete UV theory, which reproduces a type-II seesaw model, thus naturally including neutrino masses. We analyze the consequences of this scenario at the LHC.\n\n", "2505.02745": "2025-05-05, **Dynamical coupled-channel models for hadron dynamics**, Michael D\u00f6ring et.al., [2505.02745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02745v1)\n\n Dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) approaches parametrize the interactions and dynamics of two and more hadrons and their response to different electroweak probes.

However, a common misconception arises in the interpretation of experimental results: the assumption that the so-called effective neutrino magnetic moment is a universal, experiment-independent quantity. In reality, this effective parameter depends on the specific characteristics of each experiment, including the neutrino source, flavor composition or energy spectrum. As a result, the effective magnetic moment derived from solar neutrino data differs fundamentally from that obtained in reactor or accelerator-based experiments. Treating these quantities as directly comparable can lead to misleading conclusions. In this work, we clarify the proper definition of the effective neutrino magnetic moment in various experimental contexts and discuss the implications of this misconception for global analyses and theoretical interpretations.\n\n", "2505.02600": "2025-05-05, **Thermonuclear Heating of Accreting Neutron Stars**, Martin Nava-Callejas et.al., [2505.02600v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02600v1)\n\n We describe a new method to incorporate thermonuclear heating in the envelope of accreting neutron star into long term simulations of their thermal evolution. We obtain boundary conditions for the heat exchange between the envelope and the crust based on stationary models which include nuclear burning and validate these values comparing to the results of the time-dependent code \\texttt{MESA}. These simple boundary conditions allow us to explore a large parameter space.

Such invariants are explicitly calculated with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the seesaw flavor structure containing nine active-sterile flavor mixing angles and six independent CP-violating phases, and their corresponding roles in the CP-violating asymmetries of three heavy Majorana neutrino decays and in the flavor oscillations of three light Majorana neutrinos are briefly discussed.

Now, using the interaction of gravitational waves with electrodynamics and a change in readout strategy, we use the ABRA-10 cm detector for the first search for high-frequency gravitational waves using a modified axion detector. Potential sources at these high frequencies (10 kHz to 5 MHz) include merging primordial black hole binaries or superradiance, among other beyond the standard model phenomena. This paper presents the design, results, and challenges from the ABRA-10 cm high-frequency gravitational wave search, showing it is possible to simultaneously look for axions and high-frequency gravitational waves with both searches matching theoretical expectations for sensitivity. Additionally, we conducted the first time series transient search with data from an axion experiment, achieving sensitivity to $10^{-4}$ in strain. Scaled directly to the next generation axion experiment, DMRadio-GUT, this sensitivity would imply a reach to 0.01 $M\\_{\\odot}$ primordial black hole mergers at distances around 3 pc, with prospects to go significantly further with modifications to the readout.\n\n", "2505.02803": "2025-05-05, **Stabilizing dark matter with quantum scale symmetry**, Abhishek Chikkaballi et.al., [2505.02803v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02803v1)\n\n In the context of gauge-Yukawa theories with trans-Planckian asymptotic safety, quantum scale symmetry can prevent the appearance in the Lagrangian of couplings that would otherwise be allowed by the gauge symmetry. Such couplings correspond to irrelevant Gaussian fixed points of the renormalization group flow. Their absence in the theory implies that different sectors of the gauge-Yukawa theory are secluded from one another, in similar fashion to the effects of a global or a discrete symmetry. As an example, we impose the trans-Planckian scale symmetry on a model of Grand Unification based on the gauge group SU(6), showing that it leads to the emergence of several fermionic WIMP dark matter candidates whose coupling strengths are entirely predicted by the UV completion.\n\n", "2505.02669": "2025-05-05, **A random walk model for the evolution of the halo spin vector**, Jun Hou et.al., [2505.02669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02669v1)\n\n We follow the spin vector evolutions of well resolved dark matter haloes (containing more than 300 particles) in merger tree main branches from the Millennium and Millennium-II N-body simulations, from z about 3.3 to z = 0. We find that there seems to be a characteristic plane for the spin vector evolution along each main branch. In the direction perpendicular to it, spin vectors oscillate around the plane, while within the plane, spin vectors show a coherent direction change as well as a diffusion in direction (possibly corresponds to a Gaussian white noise). This plane may reflect the geometry of surrounding large-scale structures. We also construct a simple stochastic model in which halo spin vector evolution is assumed to be driven by accretion of halo mass and angular momentum.

The initial step of analysis of this model was the reconstruction of the equilibrium states of the axionically-aetherically active plasma, which are characterized by frequent inter-particle collisions. In the second part of the work, presented here, in the framework of isotropic homogeneous cosmological model we consider the collisionless limit of the theory, and thus, we focus on the analysis of the particle dynamics under the influence of axionically-aetherically induced forces. The complete distribution functions, as exact solutions to the kinetic equations, are presented.

This brings into question the perturbativity of these models. In this context, and in light of the new limits from the LZ experiment, we investigate the status of the simplest thermal dark matter model: a singlet scalar, real or complex, coupled to the Higgs boson. We calculate the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the direct detection rates as well as for the annihilations driving thermal freeze-out. For the complex case, we find that the entire perturbative region is excluded by direct detection. For the real case we find that the mass should be $\\gtrsim 20\\,{\\rm TeV}$ at NLO, compared with the $\\gtrsim 30\\,{\\rm TeV}$ LO limit. We highlight that a three-fold improvement on WIMP spin independent interactions can fully test the real scalar model in the perturbative regime.

These quantities allow simple tests of consistency with the Planck LCDM cosmology. The parameter Dperp is determined with negligible uncertainty from Planck under the assumption of LCDM. Comparing with measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we find that the measurements of Dperp from Data Release 2 (DR2) move into significantly better agreement with the Planck LCDM cosmology compared to DESI Data Release 1 (DR1). The quantity in the orthogonal direction Dpar provides a measure of the physical matter density omega\\_m in the LCDM cosmology. The DR2 measurements of Dpar\\ also come into better agreement with Planck LCDM compared to the earlier DR1 results.

We present a critique of the statistical methodology employed by the DESI collaboration and argue that it gives a misleading impression of the evidence in favour of evolving dark energy.

We aim to characterise the dust and gas in the circumstellar environment of the extreme Galactic red supergiant \\nmlcyg in terms of mass, morphology, and kinematics.

However, their ability to accelerate particles to reach PeV energies is questionable and lacks observational evidence. Theoretical predictions suggest that only a small subclass of very young SNRs evolving in dense environments could potentially satisfy the necessary conditions to accelerate particles to PeV energies. Most such theoretical investigations are carried out either in the standard interstellar medium or in the wind of the progenitor. Since most core collapse supernovae occur in star clusters, it is important to extend such investigation to SNRs taking place in a star cluster. In this work we focus on a SNR shock propagating in the collective wind of a compact star cluster, and we study the acceleration process as a function time, with special emphasis on the maximum energy of accelerated particles. Using both analytic and numerical approaches we investigate the spectrum of accelerated particles and maximum achievable energy in the case of pre-existing turbulence in the collective wind and self-generated magnetic perturbations. We find that similar to isolated SNRs, acceleration to PeV energies is plausible only for extreme conditions achievable only in a small subset of SNRs.\n\n", "2505.02300": "2025-05-05, **An interferometric study of B star multiplicity**, A.

While O-star multiplicity has been studied over a broad separation range, studies of B star multiplicity are lacking despite the fact that they dominate the production of core-collapse supernovae and neutron stars. We analyse interferometric data at high-angular resolution taken with PIONIER/VLTI for a sample of 32 B stars. Using parametric modelling of the closure phases and visibilities, we determine best-fit models to each of the systems and investigate whether each source is best represented by a single star or a higher-order system. Detection limits were calculated for companions to determine if they were significant. We then combined our findings from the interferometric data with results from a literature search to see if other companions were reported at different separation ranges. We find that, within the interferometric range, 72$\\pm$8\\% of the B stars are resolved as multiple systems. The most common type of system is a triple system, followed by binary systems, presumably single stars and then higher-order systems. The interferometric companion fraction derived for the sample is 1.88$\\pm$0.24. When accounting for the spectroscopic companions confirmed in the literature and wide companions inferred from Gaia data in addition to companions we find with interferometry, multiplicity and companion fractions of 0.88$\\pm$0.06 and 2.31$\\pm$0.27 respectively are obtained for our sample. The number of triple systems in particular increases significantly when accounting for spectroscopic companions, suggesting that binarity and higher-order multiplicity are integral to the evolution of B stars, as they are for O stars.\n\n"}}
