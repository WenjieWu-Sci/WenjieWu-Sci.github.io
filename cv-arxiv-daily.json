In this paper, we investigate the impact of neutrino scattering with dark matter (DM) particles in both the intergalactic medium and the Milky Way on the total flux, energy spectrum, and arrival directions of UHE neutrinos. We emphasize the complementarity of neutrino detectors at different latitudes to probe the anisotropy in the flux at Earth due to the attenuation of the neutrino flux in the Milky Way dark matter halo. We also discuss that, with mild astrophysical assumptions, limits on the DM-$\\nu$ scattering cross section can be placed even if the neutrino sources are unknown. Finally, we explore all this phenomenology with the recent UHE neutrino event KM3230213A, and place the corresponding limits in the DM-$\\nu$ scattering cross-section.\n\n", "2508.02795": "2025-08-04, **Measuring the Astrophysical $\\bar\u03bd:\u03bd$ Ratio with IceCube**, Barbara Skrzypek et.al., [2508.02795v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02795v1)\n\n Recent measurements of astrophysical neutrinos have expanded our understanding of their nature and origin. However, very little is still known about the astrophysical $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$   ratio. The only prior measurement is the recent, single Glashow event seen by IceCube. Understanding the astrophysical $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$   ratio has a bearing on multiple questions, including the astrophysical spectral shape and neutrino production mechanisms. This analysis uses a new approach to measuring the astrophysical muon $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$ ratio at various energies. It uses inelasticity, the fraction of the initial neutrino energy carried away by the hadronic shower. Inelasticity probes the $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$   ratio due to the fact that at energies below roughly 100 TeV, valence quarks dominate in deep inelastic scattering interactions, leading to different neutrino and antineutrino inelasticities and cross-sections. We use 10.3 years of IceCube data consisting of starting tracks at energies between 1 TeV and 1 PeV with a self-veto selection that enhances astrophysical event purity in the down-going direction.

Several groups have reported a $\\gamma$-ray excess toward the Galactic Centre, commonly referred to as the Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV and a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce the GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that are approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free extensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number, $U(1)\\_{L\\_i-L\\_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)\\_{B-L}$. We show that these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the observed relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection constraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing. The $L\\_\\mu-L\\_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m\\_\\chi\\sim 40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment anomalies, $(g-2)\\_{\\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection limits, for mediator masses in the range $m\\_{A'}\\sim 70-86$ GeV and a DM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L\\_e-L\\_\\tau$ and $L\\_\\mu-L\\_\\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and experimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e., approximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also matches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by strong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where $m\\_\\chi$ should be equal to $m\\_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the few-percent level.\n\n", "2508.02642": "2025-08-04, **Lepton parity dark matter and naturally unstable domain walls**, Ernest Ma et.al., [2508.02642v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02642v1)\n\n We propose a simple and predictive setup that connects neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and gravitational waves. A minimal lepton parity DM scenario is considered where the residual symmetry $(-1)^L$ from the type I seesaw acts as the dark parity $D=(-1)^{L+2j}$, ensuring DM stability without imposing any new symmetry. A singlet Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity serves as the DM candidate, interacting via a real scalar $\\sigma$ which is also even lepton parity.

We consider a scenario in which a heavy scalar field, $\\phi$, dominates the energy density of the early Universe and decays into heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of RHNs generates a lepton asymmetry, which is partially converted into the observed baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron process. The $\\phi$-dominated era and the entropy injection from the decays of $\\phi$ and RHNs leave characteristic imprints on the GW spectrum, such as damping and modified frequency dependence, that distinguish it from the standard cosmological evolution. We identify the parameter space in which non-thermal leptogenesis is successful, leading to distinctive GW spectral features. We show that these GW signals can fall within the sensitivity ranges of future detectors such as ET, DECIGO and BBO.

A promising explanation is the $\\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity (GR) on the $\\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$ nuclei up to $A \\lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the $\\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M\\_\\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope $^{92}{\\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our 12.75 $M\\_\\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects play in the $\\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.\n\n", "2508.01968": "2025-08-04, **Searches for new light particles at the Troitsk Meson Factory (TiMoFey)**, Sergey Demidov et.al., [2508.01968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01968v1)\n\n The project of a new accelerator complex at the Institute for Nuclear Research of RAS in Troitsk has recently been included in the Russian National Program ``Fundamental Properties of Matter\".

We find that TiMoFey can access new regions of parameter space of models with light axion-like particles and models with hidden photons, provided by a generic multipurpose detector installed downstream the proton beam dump. The signature to be exploited is the decay of a new particle into a pair of known particles inside the detector. Likewise, TiMoFey can probe previously unreachable ranges of parameters of models with millicharged particles obtained in measurements with detectors recognizing energy deposits associated with elastic scattering of new particles, passing through the detector volume.

The dynamical friction (DF) between DM and the companion star of a BH can provide an efficient loss of angular momentum, driving the BH-main sequence (MS) star binary to evolve toward a compact orbit system. We investigate the influence of the DF of DM on the detectability of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH)-MS binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. Taking into account the DF of DM, we employ the detailed binary evolution code MESA to model the evolution of a large number of IMBH-MS binaries. Our simulation shows that the DF of DM can drive those IMBH-MS binaries to evolve toward low-frequency GW sources for a low donor-star mass, a high spike index, or a short initial orbital period. When the spike index $\\gamma=1.60$, those IMBH-MS binaries with donor-star masses of $1.0-3.4~ M\\_{\\odot}$ and initial orbital periods of $0.65-16.82~ \\rm days$ could potentially evolve into visible LISA sources within a distance of $10~\\rm kpc$.

Indeed, we identify clear features in the dwarf spiral NGC 1560 -- a prime example for Renzo's rule -- and find correlation statistics which support Renzo's rule with a slight preference for MOND over LCDM halo fits. However, a broader analysis on galaxies in the SPARC database reveals an excess of features in rotation curves that lack clear baryonic counterparts, with correlation statistics deviating up to $3\\sigma$ on average from that predicted by both MOND and LCDM haloes, challenging the validity of Renzo's rule. Thus we do not find clear evidence for Renzo's rule in present galaxy data overall. We additionally perform mock tests, which show that a definitive test of Renzo's rule is primarily limited by the lack of clearly resolved baryonic features in current galaxy data.\n\n", "2508.03078": "2025-08-05, **Description of CRESST-II and CRESST-III pulse shape data**, G.

Here, we combine dark matter-only zoom-in simulations from the Symphony suite with the Nimbus \"star-tagging\" model of the stellar halo to assess how much information about the mass assembly of an individual galaxy cluster can be gleaned from idealized measurements of ICL outskirts. We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar profile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar \"splashback\" radii -- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete merger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We find that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time ago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser degree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters that have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time. We use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the MultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive to mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo concentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer of relaxedness, x\\_off. While our analysis is idealized, the relevant ICL features are potentially detectable in next-generation deep imaging of nearby clusters.

If measured very precisely, the signal would also hold cosmological information, for instance about bulk flows of distant sources or the presence of tensor modes. In the $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model, the acceleration of the Solar System is by far the dominant contributor to the position drift signal for sources at cosmological distances, and the measurement is therefore expected to yield a constant spheroidal dipole across redshifts as long as convergence to the cosmic restframe has been reached. The aim of this paper is to test this hypothesis. We analyze data from the cosmic reference frame dataset of Gaia data release 3 focusing on constraining the dipole and quadrupole in the position drift signal, with an emphasis on redshift dependence of the signal as a consistency test of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. The spheroidal dipole that we find is in mild tension, at the level of $2-3\\sigma$, with the constant-in-redshift signature expected from the local acceleration of the Solar System. We also find significant quadrupole components, that however do not have any significant evolution with redshift. The most straightforward interpretation of these findings is (unknown) systematic errors related to the Gaia instrumentation, but a cosmological origin is a possibility. Our analysis remains inconclusive on the cause of the redshift dependence of the dipole and warrants further investigations with upcoming data releases.

Previous studies found evidence for the presence of low-mass dark matter haloes in observations of the gravitationally lensed, dusty star-forming galaxy SDP.81, using the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA). In this work, we analyse these observations to assess the robustness of these reported results. While our analysis indicates that the data support additional angular structure in the lensing mass distribution beyond an elliptical power-law density profile, we do not find evidence for two previously reported sub-halo detections. However, we verify with realistic mock data that we could have found evidence in favour of a previously reported $\\approx 10^{9}\\,{\\rm M\\_{\\odot}}$ sub-halo with a log Bayes factor of 29, should it exist in the real data. After testing various systematics, we find that this previous sub-halo inference was most likely spurious and resulted from an inadequate smooth model, specifically, poorly fitting multipoles. While we do not find evidence in favour of any individual sub-halo, we find evidence for similarity in the lensing signatures of multipoles ($m=3,4$) and single massive sub-haloes, consistent with other recent work. We suggest that future searches for low-mass haloes in lensed arcs include lens angular structure in the form of multipoles up to 4th order and require a good-fitting smooth model as a prerequisite.

From imaging of tidal debris, the morphology of stellar streams can be used to infer the geometry of dark matter halos. In this paper, we develop a generative approach, X-Stream, which translates stream imaging into constraints on the radial density profile of dark matter halos--from the inner region out to the virial radius. Using the GPU-accelerated code streamsculptor, we generate thousands of stream realizations in trial gravitational potentials and apply nested sampling with a custom objective function to explore viable regions of parameter space. We find that multiple stellar streams can be used to constrain the entire radial density profile of a halo, including both its inner and outer density slopes. These constraints provide a test for alternatives to cold dark matter, such as self-interacting dark matter, which predicts cored density profiles. From cosmological simulations, the outer density slope is expected to correlate with merger histories though remains underexplored observationally. With ongoing and upcoming missions such as Euclid, the Rubin Observatory, ARRAKIHS, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, X-Stream will enable detailed mapping of dark matter for thousands of galaxies across a wide range of redshifts and halo masses.\n\n", "2508.02467": "2025-08-04, **Particle Detection Using Magnetic Avalanches in Single-Molecule Magnet Crystals**, Bailey Kohn et.al., [2508.02467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02467v1)\n\n The detection of a single quantum of energy with high efficiency and a low false positive rate is of considerable scientific interest, from serving as single quantum sensors of optical and infra-red photons to enabling the direct detection of low-mass dark matter.

In this paper we study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied.

Here we explore a grid of stellar evolution models of Pop III stars with masses $20\\leq M\\_{\\rm ZAMS}/M\\_\\odot \\leq 100$, which are initially rotating with surface angular velocities $0.6\\leq \\Omega\\_0/\\Omega\\_{\\rm crit}\\leq 0.9$, where centrifugally-driven mass loss ensues for $\\Omega>\\Omega\\_{\\rm crit}$. Realistic accretion and jet propagation models are used to derive the initial black hole masses and spins, and jet breakout times for these stars. The GRB production efficiency is obtained over a phase space comprising progenitor initial mass, rotation, and wind efficiency. For modest wind efficiency of $\\eta\\_{\\rm wind}=0.45-0.35$, the Pop III GRB production efficiency is $\\eta\\_{\\rm GRB}\\sim10^{-5}-3\\times10^{-4}\\,M\\_\\odot^{-1}$, respectively, for a top-heavy IMF. This yields an observable all-sky equivalent rate of $\\sim2-40\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ by \\textit{Swift}, with 75\\% of the GRBs located at $z\\lesssim8$. If the actual observed rate is much lower, then this would imply $\\eta\\_{\\rm wind}>0.45$, which leads to significant loss of mass and angular momentum that renders isolated Pop III stars incapable of producing GRBs and favours a binary scenario instead.\n\n", "2508.03602": "2025-08-05, **Testing Gauss-Bonnet Gravity with DESI BAO Data**, Praveen Kumar Dhankar et.al., [2508.03602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03602v1)\n\n In the present paper, we observationally constrain f (G) gravity at the background level using Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon Plus (PP) sample, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and the recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI. For the analysis, we consider two combinations of datasets: (i) PP + CC, and (ii) PP + CC + DESI BAO. In both cases, we determine the best-fit parameters by numerically solving the modified Friedmann equations for two distinct f (G) models, namely the power-law and exponential forms. This is achieved through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. To assess the statistical significance of the f (G) models, we employ both the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our results show that both f (G) models are statistically favored over the standard {\\Lambda}CDM model. Notably, the exponential model exhibits an additional future transition at redshift closer to -0.1, indicating a possible return to a decelerating phase. This distinctive behavior sets it apart from both the power-law model and the {\\Lambda}CDM scenario, which predict continued acceleration into the future.\n\n", "2508.02656": "2025-08-04, **Optical and near-infrared nebular-phase spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi: constraints on the structure of the inner ejecta, progenitor mass, and dust**, Emilio Hueichap\u00e1n et.al., [2508.02656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02656v1)\n\n We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN\\,2024ggi from 250 and 420 days after the explosion. Comparing the evolution of the [\\ion{O}{1}] at 6300, 6363 \\text{\\AA} doublet normalized to the continuum with spectral models from the literature, we estimate a progenitor star zero-age main-sequence mass ($M\\_{\\mathrm{ZAMS}}$) of $\\approx 14$ M$\\_\\odot$. This value is consistent with $M\\_{\\mathrm{ZAMS}}$ reported in the literature from independent methodologies. The nebular spectra are used to study the structure of the inner ejecta. The broad H$\\alpha$ line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\\simeq 3900$ km s$^{-1}$, with small deviations from a symmetric Gaussian profile centred at zero velocity, and the [\\ion{O}{1}] doublet is blue-shifted by $\\approx -940$ km s$^{-1}$. In the NIR, the nebular spectra reveal double-peaked emission features of \\ion{Mg}{1} and [\\ion{Fe}{2}] lines, suggesting a bipolar distribution of intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the line-of-sight. Such a double-peaked feature in these NIR lines has not been previously reported. No corresponding asymmetries are observed in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that the asymmetry is mostly confined to intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the innermost core of the supernova ejecta. Additionally, we detect first-overtone carbon monoxide (CO) emission at $2.3$ $\\mu$m from 250 to 319 days in the NIR.\n\n"}}
