Following reactor shutdown, a low-intensity flux of ``residual neutrinos'' persists due to the decay of long-lived fission isotopes in the partially burnt fuel remaining within the reactor cores and in spent nuclear fuel stored in nearby cooling pools. The Double Chooz experiment at the Chooz B nuclear power plant in France achieved the first quantitative measurement of this residual flux based on 17.2 days of reactor-off data. In the energy range where the residual signal is most pronounced, the neutrino detector located 400$\\,$m from the cores recorded $106 \\pm 18$ neutrino candidate events (5.9$\\sigma$ significance).

However, any effective neutrino number itself cannot uniquely determine the underlying source. We argue that the degeneracy can be relaxed by CMB spectral distortions, which are caused by energy exchange between the extra radiation and photons. We consider neutrinogenic CMB spectral distortions, where extra energy is released in the form of neutrinos but still creates the CMB spectral distortions via electroweak interactions.

We find that subhalo gas mass is the most informative feature for constraining the WDM mass, achieving a determination coefficient of R^2 = 0.9. We employ symbolic regression to extract simple, interpretable relations with the WDM particle mass. Finally, we adopt a more localized approach by selecting individual dark matter halos and using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a normalizing flow to infer the WDM mass, incorporating subhalo properties as node features and global simulation statistics as graph-level features.

Among various candidates, the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) scenario stands out and is under extensive study. The detection of the hypothetical gamma-ray emission from WIMP annihilation could act as a direct probe of electroweak-scale interactions, complementing DM collider searches and other direct DM detection techniques. At very high energies (VHE), WIMP self-annihilation is expected to produce gamma rays together with other Standard Model particles. The galactic center (GC), due to its relative proximity to the Earth and its high expected DM density, is a prime target for monoenergetic line searches. IACTs have placed strong constraints on the DM properties at the GC, with the MAGIC providing the most stringent limits from 20 TeV to 100 TeV, exploiting large zenith angle (LZA) observations. However, the limited field of view (FoV) of the MAGIC telescopes (< 3.5{\\deg} ) prevented a detailed study of the extended region around the GC in which an enhanced DM density is expected.

Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from $z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies.

The results show that this case is viable over a wide range of dark matter masses with the Yukawa coupling of $S\\_0$ and $\\chi$ should be larger than 1.

The sample spans a wide mass range, from M500 about 2x10^13 to 7x10^14 solar masses, and includes well-studied systems such as Coma, Perseus, and Virgo. We carefully modeled all background components, including the soft X-ray foregrounds (the Local Hot Bubble, Milky Way Halo, and super-virial temperature components), the cosmic X-ray background, and the non-X-ray background, and assessed their effects on the derived properties of the intracluster medium (ICM). We constructed radial profiles of emission measure, electron density, and temperature. Temperatures decrease smoothly with radius, typically dropping to about one-third to half of their peak values near r200. For relaxed clusters, the emission measure profiles outside the core regions are well described by a beta model with beta around 0.6-0.7, while groups show slightly flatter slopes of beta around 0.4-0.65. Beyond r2500, electron density profiles follow a power-law decline with a slope close to 2. At r500 and r200, the electron density and the gas mass fraction show a tight correlation with the system mass, except for three clusters with bright subclusters. In massive clusters, the gas fraction increases with radius and approaches the cosmic baryon fraction near r200. In contrast, lower-mass systems exhibit gas fractions of around 0.1 at r200. The observed mass dependence of gas fractions suggests that feedback and related processes play an increasingly important role toward the group scale, shaping the connection between baryons and dark matter halos.\n\n", "2510.04416": "2025-10-06, **Analysis of Galaxies at the Extremes: Failed Galaxy Progenitors in the MAGNETICUM Simulations**, Jonah S.

We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2510.04872": "2025-10-06, **The demographics of core-collapse supernovae I.

In massive binary systems, mass-transfer alters the pre-SN structures compared to single stars, leading to a diversity in SN explosions. Aims. We compute the distribution of CC-SN properties based on comprehensive detailed grids of single and binary stellar evolution models. We conduct a grid-based population synthesis to produce a synthetic population of CC-SNe, and compare it to observed SN samples. We also apply various explodability and merger criteria to our models. In line with earlier results, we identify interacting SN progenitors as those stars that undergo CC during or shortly after a Roche-lobe overflow phase. With an interacting binary fraction of 68%, our models predict two-thirds of all CC-SNe to be of Type IIP/L, and 1/3 of Type Ibc, in agreement with recent volume-limited SN surveys. We find that 76% of the Type Ibc SN progenitors took part in a previous binary mass transfer (mostly as mass donor), but also 63% of the Type IIP/L SN progenitors (mostly as mass gainers), yielding a much broader envelope mass distribution than expected from single stars. We find that mass-transfer induced interacting SNe make up ~5% of all CC-SNe, which is close to the observed fractions of Type IIn and Type Ibn SNe. When assuming a disk or toroidal CSM geometry for Type IIn SNe, our models predict a bimodal distribution of the radiated energies, similar to that deduced from observations. While we find the effect of binary evolution on the relative number of Type Ibc and Type IIP/L SNe to be moderate, it leads to lower average ejecta masses in Type Ibc and Type IIb SNe, and can lead to higher pre-SN masses in Type IIP/L SNe than single stars.

For instance, the efficient acceleration of charged particles at supernova remnant shocks requires rapidly growing instabilities, so much so that none of the proposed processes seem sufficient to warrant acceleration to PeV energies. In this work, we investigate whether an acoustic instability triggered by the presence of a CR pressure gradient can lead to significant self-confinement of charged particles in the vicinity of shocks.

Longo et.al., [2510.04570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04570v1)\n\n Jets in active galactic nuclei have to cross significant distances within their host galaxies, meeting large numbers of stars of different masses and evolution stages in their paths. Given enough time, supernova explosions within the jet will eventually happen, and may have a strong impact on its dynamics, potentially triggering powerful non-thermal activity. We carried out a detailed numerical study to explore the dynamics of the interaction between the ejecta of a supernova explosion and a relativistic extragalactic jet. By means of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the code RATPENAT, we simulated the jet-ejecta interaction in two different geometries or scenarios: a two-dimensional, axisymmetric simulation, and a three-dimensional one, which includes the orbital velocity of the exploding star. Although initially filling a region much smaller than the jet radius, the ejecta expands and eventually covers most of the jet cross section. The expansion is enhanced as more energy from the jet is converted into kinetic and internal energy of the ejecta, which also favors the ejecta disruption, all this occurring on timescales ~ 10^4 yr. Although a complete numerical convergence of the results is unattainable given the subsonic, turbulent nature of the interaction region, the simulations are consistent in their description of the gross morphological and dynamical properties of the interaction process. At the end of the simulations, the supernova ejecta has already partially mixed with the relativistic jet. The results also suggest that the jet-ejecta interaction may be a non-negligible non-thermal emitter. Moreover, due to efficient mixing, the interaction region can be a potential source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays of heavy composition.\n\n", "2510.04414": "2025-10-06, **Latest view of CTA 1 with VERITAS**, Alisha Chromey et.al., [2510.04414v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04414v1)\n\n CTA 1 is a shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) with a central pulsar wind nebula (PWN), visible at very-high-energy (VHE) from 50 GeV to 100 TeV from a moderately extended emission region.

CTA 1 is on the cusp of middle age (~13 kyr) and spatially resolvable at energies visible to imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), such as the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) (PSF < 0.1 deg). Therefore, this remnant is an excellent candidate to study lepton propagation and escape between different PWN evolutionary stages.

The Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization -- a widely used two-parameter model for the dark energy equation of state -- displays marked early-time phantom behavior and a recent crossing of the phantom divide. These features suggest the convenience to check observationally the robustness of such evolution. To address this, we design two alternative families of two-parameter dark energy parameterizations which remain close to the original CPL but aim to soften its phantom character. Specifically, these models reproduce CPL-like behavior at low redshift but mitigate early phantom behavior through the use of smooth sigmoid transitions, yielding a more gradual evolution. By combining recent DESI data with constraints from the cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernovae, we assess the viability of these models. Our analysis shows that CPL remains a strong and competitive parameterization, with the proposed alternatives only marginally favored or disfavored.
