Such particles frequently arise in non-minimal hidden sectors that couple to the Standard Model through portal operators. We consider two distinct scenarios. In the first scenario, which arises from a neutrino portal interaction, a hidden sector particle is produced inside the detector by the collision of an energetic neutrino with a nucleon, giving rise to a visible cascade. This new state then decays into a hidden sector daughter, which can naturally be long-lived. The eventual decay of the daughter particle back to Standard Model states gives rise to a second cascade inside the detector. This scenario therefore gives rise to a characteristic \"double bang\" signal arising from the two distinct cascades. In the second scenario, which arises from a hypercharge portal interaction, a hidden sector particle is produced outside the detector by the collision of an atmospheric muon with a nucleon. This new state promptly decays into a pair of hidden sector daughters that are long-lived. If both daughters decay into Standard Model states inside the detector, we again obtain a double-bang signal from the two distinct cascades. We explore the reach of IceCube for these two scenarios and show that it has the potential to significantly improve the sensitivity to hidden sector models in the mass range from about a GeV to about 20 GeV.\n\n", "2506.05258": "2025-06-05, **Closing in on singly charged scalars**, Snehadri Das et.al., [2506.05258v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05258v1)\n\n We investigate current experimental constraints and future search prospects for a hypothetical spin-zero particle that carries unit electric charge: a singly charged scalar (SCS). In addition to providing useful benchmarks for collider searches, SCS particles are also well-motivated ingredients in relatively minimal dark sectors. We focus on scenarios in which the SCS decays promptly at colliders to a lepton plus either a neutrino or an invisible dark-sector particle of negligible mass. A promptly decaying SCS can easily have appreciable branching ratios to more than one lepton flavor while remaining consistent with constraints on lepton flavor violation. This broadens the allowed range of SCS masses to extend well beyond those for right-handed selectrons, smuons, or staus. For particular benchmark SCS branching ratios, we find that SCS masses above ~185 GeV and in a lower-mass window ~80-125 GeV are still allowed at 95% confidence level. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations to explore the potential of a boosted-decision-tree-based analysis to probe the surviving SCS parameter space in future searches at the (HL-)LHC, finding a significant increase in sensitivity relative to cut-based analyses both in the lower-mass window and at higher SCS masses.\n\n", "2506.04984": "2025-06-05, **Probing new physics scenarios using high energy events at NOvA far detector**, Chinmay Bera et.al., [2506.04984v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04984v1)\n\n NuMI Off-axis $\\nu\\_e$ Appearance (NOvA) experiment is an ongoing long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.

However, it is a long-term challenge to model this biased tracer and connect the observable to the underlying physics. In this work, we present a hybrid Lagrangian bias expansion emulator, combining the Lagrangian bias expansion and the accurate dynamical evolution from $N$-body simulation, to predict the power spectrum of the biased tracer in real space. We employ the Kun simulation suite to construct the emulator, emulating across the space of 8 cosmological parameters including dynamic dark energy $w\\_0$, $w\\_a$, and total neutrino mass $\\sum m\\_{\\nu}$. The sample variance due to the finite simulation box is further reduced using the Zel'dovich variance control, and it enables the precise measurement of the Lagrangian basis spectra up to quadratic order.

An important corollary of such non-standard scenarios is relic dark matter annihilation after neutrino decoupling, an effect that does not modify the neutrino temperature and was neglected in constraining the standard MeV-scale dark matter masses. By combining the contributions from entropy injection during neutrino decoupling and nonthermal neutrino energy release after decoupling, we derive significant constraints on the annihilation cross section to neutrinos, which in some mass regimes turn out to be stronger than the current bounds. Furthermore, we find that the lower bounds on dark matter masses become inconclusive under the recent data releases from the DESI, SPT-3G, and ACT collaborations.

They are intended for graduate students at the early stages of their study of dark matter with some prior exposure to cosmology and quantum field theory. The primary aim is to offer an accessible introduction to dark matter and to lay the groundwork for exploring its phenomenology. These lectures are not intended to serve as a comprehensive review. We begin by motivating the study of dark matter through a discussion of the empirical evidence and the constraints it places on dark matter properties.

This setup enables 3D event reconstruction: photomultipliers signals provide depth information, while the camera delivers high-precision transverse resolution. In this work, we present a Bayesian Network-based algorithm designed to reconstruct the events using only the photomultipliers signals, yielding a full 3D description of the particle trajectories. The algorithm models the light collection process probabilistically and estimates spatial and intensity parameters on the Gas Electron Multiplier plane, where light emission occurs. It is implemented within the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling for posterior inference. Validation using data from the CYGNO LIME prototype shows accurate reconstruction of localized and extended tracks. Results demonstrate that the Bayesian approach enables robust 3D description and, when combined with camera data, further improves the precision of track reconstruction.

Our goal is to examine under what conditions, {\\it absolute} consistency with HAT-validating GW data analyses is guaranteed. As a consequence of this demand for absolute consistency, nontrivial, albeit indirect, constraints appear to emerge on the Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) part of the spectrum of perturbative elementary particle fluctuations in a classical black hole background.

Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and Pulsar Polarization Arrays (PPAs) aim to detect this dark matter through timing and polarization measurements, respectively, of pulsars. The PTA relies on gravitational effects, as the ALDM halo perturbs the spacetime metric within the Milky Way, while the PPA detects non-gravitational effects, namely cosmological birefringence induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with photons. These two methods complement each other, synergistically enhancing the pulsar array's capability to identify the ALDM signals in the data. In this article, we provide a foundational development of this synergy. We begin by revisiting previously derived two-point correlation functions for both PTA and PPA, and expand our analysis to include correlations between timing and polarization signals. We then construct likelihood functions for PTA and combined PTA-PPA analyses within a Bayesian framework, aimed at detecting the characteristic correlations of ALDM signals. We emphasize the non-Gaussianity of the ALDM timing signals, which arises from their non-linear dependence on the field, in contrast to the Gaussian nature of its polarization signals. To address the complexities introduced, we approach this investigation in two ways: one involves a Gaussian approximation with proper justifications, while the other derives the formalism from the generic Gaussian characteristics of the ALDM field. We anticipate that these efforts will lead to further developments in PTA and PTA-PPA analysis methods.\n\n", "2506.04844": "2025-06-05, **Characterization of the Hamamatsu R12699-406-M4 Photomultiplier Tube in Cold Xenon Environments**, M.

The device demonstrated a gain exceeding $2\\cdot 10^6$ at the nominal voltage of -1.0 kV, along with a low dark count rate of $(0.4\\pm0.2)\\;\\text{Hz/cm}^2$. Due to the compact design, afterpulses exhibited short delay times, resulting in some cases in an overlap with the light-induced signal. To evaluate its applicability in a realistic detector environment, two R12699-406-M2 units were deployed in a small-scale dual-phase xenon time projection chamber.

Yet, those are always described as scalar or vector fields. In this paper, we explore instead the embedding of the scalar particle in an antisymmetric rank-three tensor field, and the dark photon into an antisymmetric rank-two tensor field (a so-called Kalb-Ramond field), and construct minimal bases of effective interactions with Standard Model fields. Then, keeping phenomenological applications as our main objective, a number of theoretical aspects are clarified, in particular related to the impact of existing dualities among the corresponding free theories, and concerning their Stueckelberg representations. Besides, for the rank-two field, we present for the first time its full propagator, accounting for the possible presence of a pseudoscalar mass term. Thanks to these results, and with their different kinematics, gauge-invariant limits, and Lorentz properties, we show that these higher-form fields provide genuine alternative frameworks, with different couplings and expected signatures at low-energy or at colliders.\n\n", "2506.04747": "2025-06-05, **The Centre of Attention: a Powerful Radio Galaxy Pinpoints a NIR-Dark Protocluster at z~3.9**, A.

Some of the fermions acquire masses through a vacuum expectation value of a Higgs field, and they are stable due to an accidental symmetry. This makes them dark matter candidates. If the dark sector was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model and dark radiation constraints are included, two-component dark matter may be needed since the number of massless fermions is restricted. To meet the requirements from dark matter direct detection experiments, the main component should be a Majorana fermion, and the secondary component should be a Dirac fermion.

This study proposes a way to substantially augment the axion-photon interaction by confining the photons within high-quality-factor dielectric resonators, increasing their intensity and lifetime and thus the possibility of interacting with axions in the background. In view of this, we study resonant axion-mediated photonic transitions in millimeter-sized spherical dielectric resonators, based on fully analytical calculations to the first order in perturbation theory. Such resonators exhibit high lifetime Mie resonances in the microwave part of the spectrum, with a separation that can be tailored with the radius of the sphere to match the expected axion frequency, allowing axion-mediated photonic transitions when particular selection rules are fulfilled. Such transitions are expected to be enhanced by more than ten orders of magnitude in the presence of the resonator, compared to transitions occurring in homogeneous space.\n\n", "2506.04533": "2025-06-05, **Temperature-Dependent Characterization of Large-Area Superconducting Microwire Array with Single-Photon Sensitivity in the Near-Infrared**, Christina Wang et.al., [2506.04533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04533v1)\n\n Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a leading detector technology for time-resolved single-photon counting from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared regime.

We performed comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations based on the first CHIME/FRB catalog to test whether the FRB population tracks the cosmic star formation history directly or requires a delay. By fully considering CHIME's complex selection effects and beam response, we find that the hypothesis that the FRB population tracks the SFH is not ruled out by the current data, although a small delay is preferred. This is consistent with the scenario in which young magnetars formed through core-collapse supernovae serve as the progenitors of FRBs.

Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray (ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population. Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about 0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors dominate over intrinsic scatter.
