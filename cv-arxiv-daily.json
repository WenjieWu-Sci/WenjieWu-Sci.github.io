We assume that the R-parity is only broken by the lepton number violating bilinear term. We try to fit two non-zero neutrino mass square differences and three mixing angle values obtained from the global $\\chi^2$ analysis of neutrino oscillation data. We have also taken into account the updated data of the standard model (SM) Higgs mass and its coupling strengths with other SM particles from LHC Run-II along with low energy flavor violating constraints like rare b-hadron decays. We have used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the new physics parameter space. While doing so, we ensure that all the existing collider constraints are duly taken into account. Through our analysis we have derived the most stringent constraints possible till date with existing data on the 9 bilinear R-parity violating parameters along with $\\mu$ and $\\tan\\beta$. We further explore the possibility of explaining the anomalous muon (g - 2) measurement staying within the parameter space allowed by neutrino, Higgs and flavor data while satisfying the collider constraints as well.

The analysis uses $\\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV proton-proton collision data with an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ recorded during 2015-2018 by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis targets final states including exactly two same-sign muons and at least two hadronic jets well separated in rapidity.

The distribution of the transverse momentum of the second-hardest muon is used to search for signals originating from a heavy Majorana neutrino with a mass between 50 GeV and 20 TeV. No significant excess is observed over the background expectation. The results are interpreted in a benchmark scenario of the Phenomenological Type-I Seesaw model.

The model can explain neutrino masses as well as the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry, for masses of the heavy singlets below the electroweak scale. The only physical CP violating phases in the model are those in the PMNS mixing matrix, i.e. the Dirac phase and a Majorana phase that enter light neutrino observables. We present an accurate analytic approximation for the baryon asymmetry in terms of CP flavour invariants, and derive the correlations with neutrino observables.

We construct the general theoretical framework and identify two crucial mixing sources involving the photon, which facilitate communication between the hidden and visible sectors: kinetic mixing with the photon, and plasma-induced mixing due to thermal electron loops. For both cases, we focus on the second stage of the solar proton-proton chain and evaluate the fluxes of monochromatic 5.49 MeV hidden vectors produced by the $p(d, ^3{\\rm He})\\gamma^\\prime$ nuclear reaction. We then investigate their terrestrial detection via Compton-like scatterings and decays.

Our results show that, in this special kinematic configuration, the difference between Dirac and Majorana cases vanishes once the inaccessible neutrino angle is integrated out, which seems to be incompatible with the proposal in arXiv:2106.11785. We work on that and conclude that the discrepancy comes from the kinematic treatment, specifically from the angular integration and clarify these issues with consistency tests.

In high-energy physics, quite a few possible applications are investigated in the context of gauge theories and their application to dynamic problems, topological problems, high-baryon density configurations, or collective neutrino oscillations. In particular, schemes for simulating neutrino oscillations are proposed using a quantum walk framework. In this study, we approach the problem of simulating neutrino oscillation from the perspective of open quantum systems by treating the position space of quantum walk as environment. We have obtained the recurrence relation for Kraus operator which is used to represent the dynamics of the neutrino flavor change in the form of reduced coin states. We establish a connection between the dynamics of reduced coin state and neutrino phenomenology, enabling one to fix the simulation parameters for a given neutrino experiment and reduces the need for extended position space to simulate neutrino oscillations.

However, as shown in this paper, there are instances in which the electroweak loop corrections are relatively large, and change significantly the spin-independent dark matter scattering rate. An important example occurs when the dark matter particle is a wino, e.g., in anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) and pure gravity mediation (PGM) models. We find that the one-loop electroweak corrections to the spin-independent wino LSP scattering cross section generally interfere constructively with the tree-level contribution for AMSB models with negative Higgsino mixing, $\\mu < 0$, and in PGM-like models for both signs of $\\mu$, lifting the cross section out of the neutrino fog and into a range that is potentially detectable in the next generation of direct searches for cold dark matter scattering.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2305.15185": "2023-05-24, **Recent results from continuous gravitational wave searches using data from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA's third observing run**, Andrew L.

We also show that the observed relation between the non-minimal coupling length scale and the virial mass found in Gandolfi et al., 2022 for Late Type Galaxies is consistent with the relation we find in the current work, suggesting that the previously determined power-law scaling law holds up to galaxy cluster mass scales.\n\n", "2305.14400": "2023-05-23, **The Reconstruction of Constant Jerk Parameter with $f(R,T)$ Gravity in Bianchi-I spacetime**, Anirudh Pradhan et.al., [2305.14400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14400v1)\n\n We have developed a Bianchi I cosmological model of the universe in $f(R,T)$ gravity theory which fit good with the present day scenario of accelerating universe.

We can explain the metallicity distribution function and the runs of different element-to-iron abundance ratios as functions of [Fe/H] derived from optical-infrared spectroscopy of giant stars in Terzan 5, by assuming that the cluster experienced two major star formation bursts separated by a long quiescent phase. We further predict that the most metal-rich stars in Terzan 5 are moderately He-enhanced and a large spread of He abundances in the cluster, Y = 0.26-0.335. We conclude that current observations fit within a formation scenario in which Terzan 5 originated from a pristine, or slightly metal-enriched, gas clump about one order of magnitude more massive than its present-day mass.

We fit the data to closure relations describing the synchrotron emission, finding the electron spectral index to be $p = 2.42 ^{+0.44} \\_{-0.30}$, and evidence of late-time energy injection with coefficient $q = 0.24 ^{+0.24} \\_{-0.18}$. The jet half opening angle lower limit ($\\theta\\_{j} \\ge 16^{\\circ}$) is inferred from the non-detection of a jet break.

Clues from Globular Clusters Formation**, Alvio Renzini et.al., [2305.14476v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14476v1)\n\n The mere existence of multiple stellar generations in Milky Way globular clusters indicates that each generation was unable to stop star formation, that instead persisted unimpeded for several million years. This evidence argues for an extended stage of star formation within a forming globular cluster, during which stellar feedback was substantially ineffective and the nascent globular cluster was able to accrete processed gas from its surrounding, and efficiently convert it into successive stellar generations. It has been argued that such delayed feedback results from core collapse in most massive stars failing to trigger an energetic supernova explosion, but rather leading directly to black hole formation. Thus, globular clusters offer a concrete phenomenological example for the lack of feedback in young starbursts, an option that has been widely advocated to account for the unexpected abundance of UV-luminous galaxies at z = 9-16, as revealed by JWST observations. The paper is meant to attract attention to this opportunity for a synergic cooperation of globular cluster and high redshift research.\n\n", "2305.14447": "2023-05-23, **Possible detection of the progenitor of the Type II supernova SN2023ixf**, Joanne L.

Central among these are the multiplicity of feedback channels, which remain incompletely understood. One outstanding problem is the understanding and modeling of the multiphase nature of galactic winds, which play a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution. We present the results of three dimensional magnetohydrodynamical tall box interstellar medium patch simulations with clustered supernova driven outflows. Fragmentation of the interstellar medium during superbubble breakout seeds the resulting hot outflow with a population of cool clouds. We focus on analyzing and modeling the origin and properties of these clouds. Their presence induces large scale turbulence, which in turn leads to complex cloud morphologies. Cloud sizes are well described by a power law distribution and mass growth rates can be modelled using turbulent radiative mixing layer theory. Turbulence provides significant pressure support in the clouds, while magnetic fields only play a minor role. We conclude that many of the physical insights and analytic scalings derived from idealized small scale simulations translate well to larger scale, more realistic turbulent magnetized winds, thus paving a path towards their necessary yet challenging inclusion in global-scale galaxy models.\n\n", "2305.14421": "2023-05-23, **Are classification metrics good proxies for SN Ia cosmological constraining power?**, Alex I. Malz et.al., [2305.14421v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14421v1)\n\n Context: When selecting a classifier to use for a supernova Ia (SN Ia) cosmological analysis, it is common to make decisions based on metrics of classification performance, i.e. contamination within the photometrically classified SN Ia sample, rather than a measure of cosmological constraining power. If the former is an appropriate proxy for the latter, this practice would save those designing an analysis pipeline from the computational expense of a full cosmology forecast. Aims: This study tests the assumption that classification metrics are an appropriate proxy for cosmology metrics. Methods: We emulate photometric SN Ia cosmology samples with controlled contamination rates of individual contaminant classes and evaluate each of them under a set of classification metrics. We then derive cosmological parameter constraints from all samples under two common analysis approaches and quantify the impact of contamination by each contaminant class on the resulting cosmological parameter estimates. Results: We observe that cosmology metrics are sensitive to both the contamination rate and the class of the contaminating population, whereas the classification metrics are insensitive to the latter. Conclusions: We therefore discourage exclusive reliance on classification-based metrics for cosmological analysis design decisions, e.g. classifier choice, and instead recommend optimizing using a metric of cosmological parameter constraining power.\n\n", "2305.14305": "2023-05-23, **Observational Constraints on Yukawa Cosmology and Connection with Black Hole Shadows**, Esteban Gonz\u00e1lez et.al., [2305.14305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14305v1)\n\n This research explores a cosmological model proposed in arXiv:2304.11492 by Jusufi et al., which challenges the existence of dark matter and proposes a connection between dark matter, dark energy, and baryonic matter by altering Newton's law of gravity in large-scale structures.

Ramachandran et.al., [2305.14262v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14262v1)\n\n Standard binary evolutionary models predict a significant population of core helium-burning stars that lost their hydrogen-rich envelope after mass transfer via Roche-lobe overflow. However, there is a scarcity of observations of such stripped stars in the intermediate mass regime (~1.5 - 8$ M\\_{\\odot}$), which are thought to be prominent progenitors of SN Ib/c. Especially at low metallicity, a significant fraction of these stars is expected to be only partially stripped, retaining a significant amount of hydrogen on their surfaces. For the first time, we discovered a partially stripped massive star in a binary with a Be-type companion located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using a detailed spectroscopic analysis. The stripped-star nature of the primary is revealed by the extreme CNO abundance pattern and very high luminosity-to-mass ratio, which suggest that the primary is likely shell-hydrogen burning. Our target SMCSGS-FS 69 is the most luminous and most massive system among the known stripped star + Be binaries, with Mstripped ~3$ M\\_{\\odot}$ and MBe ~17$ M\\_{\\odot}$. Binary evolutionary tracks suggest an initial mass of Mini $\\gtrsim 12 M\\_{\\odot}$ for the stripped star and predict it to be in a transition phase towards a hot compact He star, which will eventually produce a stripped-envelope supernova.

Cs\u00f6rnyei et.al., [2305.13943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13943v1)\n\n Despite being one of the best-known galaxies, the distance to the Whirlpool Galaxy, M 51, is still debated. Current estimates range from 6.02 to 9.09 Mpc, and different methods yield discrepant results. No Cepheid distance has been published for M 51 to date. We aim to estimate a more reliable distance to M 51 through two independent methods: Cepheid variables and their period-luminosity relation, and an augmented version of the expanding photosphere method (EPM) on the Type IIP SN 2005cs. For the Cepheid variables, we analyse a recently published HST catalogue of stars in M 51. By applying light curve and colour-magnitude diagram-based filtering, we select a high-quality sample of M 51 Cepheids to estimate the distance through the period-luminosity relation. For SN 2005cs, an emulator-based spectral fitting technique is applied, which allows for the fast and reliable estimation of physical parameters of the supernova atmosphere. We augment the established framework of EPM with these spectral models to obtain a precise distance to M 51. The two resulting distance estimates are D\\_Cep = 7.59 +/- 0.30 Mpc and D\\_2005cs = 7.34 +/- 0.39 Mpc using the Cepheid period-luminosity relation and the spectral modelling of SN 2005cs respectively. This is the first published Cepheid distance for this galaxy. Given that these two estimates are completely independent, one may combine them, which yields D\\_M51 = 7.50 +/- 0.24 Mpc (3.2% uncertainty). Our distance estimates are in agreement with most of the results obtained previously for M 51, while being more precise than the earlier counterparts. They are however significantly lower than the TRGB estimates, which are often adopted for the distance to this galaxy. The results highlight the importance of direct cross-checks between independent distance estimates for quantifying systematic uncertainties.\n\n", "2305.13912": "2023-05-23, **3D stellar evolution: hydrodynamic simulations of a complete burning phase in a massive star**, F. Rizzuti et.al., [2305.13912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13912v1)\n\n Our knowledge of stellar evolution is driven by one-dimensional (1D) simulations. 1D models, however, are severely limited by uncertainties on the exact behaviour of many multi-dimensional phenomena occurring inside stars, affecting their structure and evolution. Recent advances in computing resources have allowed small sections of a star to be reproduced with multi-D hydrodynamic models, with an unprecedented degree of detail and realism. In this work, we present a set of 3D simulations of a convective neon-burning shell in a 20 M$\\_\\odot$ star run for the first time continuously from its early development through to complete fuel exhaustion, using unaltered input conditions from a 321D-guided 1D stellar model. These simulations help answer some open questions in stellar physics. In particular, they show that convective regions do not grow indefinitely due to entrainment of fresh material, but fuel consumption prevails over entrainment, so when fuel is exhausted convection also starts decaying. Our results show convergence between the multi-D simulations and the new 321D-guided 1D model, concerning the amount of convective boundary mixing to include in stellar models. The size of the convective zones in a star strongly affects its structure and evolution, thus revising their modelling in 1D will have important implications for the life and fate of stars. This will thus affect theoretical predictions related to nucleosynthesis, supernova explosions and compact remnants.\n\n", "2305.14400": "2023-05-23, **The Reconstruction of Constant Jerk Parameter with $f(R,T)$ Gravity in Bianchi-I spacetime**, Anirudh Pradhan et.al., [2305.14400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14400v1)\n\n We have developed a Bianchi I cosmological model of the universe in $f(R,T)$ gravity theory which fit good with the present day scenario of accelerating universe.

A novel scenario has been proposed: When a PBH with mass $10^{-14}\\leq M\\_{\\rm PBH}/M\\_{\\odot}\\leq 10^{-11}$ transits through a white dwarf (WD) made up of carbon and oxygen, Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion in a reactive medium creates a shock wave, which generates direct detonation ignition in the WD core and then leads to thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia). The aim of this study is to impose constraints on the PBH to dark matter (DM) abundance fraction, $f\\_{\\rm PBH}$, via comparing the SN Ia event rates between PBH hypotheses and observational data.
