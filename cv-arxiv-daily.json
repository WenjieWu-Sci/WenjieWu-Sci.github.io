Most studies focus on the thermal freeze-out scenario, yet light relics produced by freeze-in are generic for models in which new light degrees of freedom do not couple strongly enough to the Standard Model (SM) plasma to allow for full thermalization in the early Universe. In ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in scenarios, rates for light relic production associated with non-renormalizable interactions typical of beyond the SM (BSM) models grow with temperature more quickly than the Hubble rate. Thus, relatively small couplings to the SM can be probed by current and next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We investigate several representative benchmark BSM models, such as axion-like particles from Primakoff production, massless dark photons and light right-handed neutrinos. We calculate contributions to the effective number of neutrino species, $\\Delta N\\_{\\rm eff}$, in corners of parameter space not previously considered and discuss the sensitivity of CMB experiments compared to other probes. In contrast to freeze-out scenarios, $\\Delta N\\_{\\rm eff}$ from UV freeze-in is more dependent on both the specific BSM physics model and the reheating temperature. Depending on the details of the BSM scenario, we find that the sensitivity of next-generation CMB experiments can complement or surpass the current astrophysical, laboratory or collider constraints on the couplings of the SM to the light relic.\n\n", "2405.09416": "2024-05-15, **Refined determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy**, M.

Different probes are sensitive to its value, among which atomic parity violation, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and parity-violating electron scattering on different nuclei. In this work, we attempt for the first time to combine all these various determinations by performing a global fit that also keeps into account the unavoidable dependence on the experimentally poorly known neutron distribution radius of the nuclei employed, for which a new measurement using proton-cesium elastic scattering became available. By using all present direct determinations of the neutron distribution radius of cesium we find $\\sin^2\\!\\vartheta\\_{W} =0.2396^{+0.0020}\\_{-0.0019}$, which should supersede the previous value determined from atomic parity violation on cesium.

Using the IceCube and latest Fermi-LAT data, we present general multimessenger constraints on the energetics of cosmic rays and the size of neutrino emission regions. In the photohadronic scenario, the required cosmic-ray luminosity should be larger than about 1-10% of the Eddington luminosity and the emission radius should be 15 Schwarzschild radii in low-beta plasma and 3 Schwarzschild radii in high-beta plasma. The leptonic scenario overshoots the NuSTAR or Fermi-LAT data for any emission radii we consider, and the required gamma-ray luminosity is much larger than the Eddington luminosity. The beta decay scenario also violates not only the energetics requirement but also gamma-ray constraints especially when the Bethe-Heitler and photomeson production processes are consistently considered.

Axions or ALPs (Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard model theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion of CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they have the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant conversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature fluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant conversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field, electron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can happen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will lead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The spectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different from the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum will be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence, with the large-scale structure.

These particles can convert into photons and vice-versa in the presence of magnetic field, with a probability decided by its coupling strength $\\mathrm{g\\_{a\\gamma}}$. One of the ways to detect these particles is using the CMB as a backlight. As the CMB photons pass through a galaxy cluster, they can get converted into ALPs in the mass range $10^{-15}$ eV to $10^{-11}$ eV through resonant conversion in the presence of cluster magnetic fields. This leads to a polarized spectral distortion ($\\alpha$-distortion) in the CMB as the photon polarization parallel to the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster is involved in the conversion. The fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density in a galaxy cluster lead to spatially varying $\\alpha$-distortion around the cluster, with a power spectrum that is different from the lensed CMB polarization power spectrum for the standard model of cosmology.

Limited spatial and mass resolution and the associated discreteness noise make following the dynamics of black holes especially challenging. In particular, dynamical friction, which is responsible for driving massive black holes towards the centres of galaxies, cannot be accurately modelled with softened $N$-body interactions. A number of subgrid models have been proposed to mimic dynamical friction or directly include its full effects in simulations. Each of these methods has its individual benefits and shortcomings, while all suffer from a common issue of being unable to represent black holes with masses below a few times the simulated dark matter particle mass. In this paper, we propose a correction for unresolved dynamical friction, which has been calibrated on simulations run with the code KETJU, in which gravitational interactions of black holes are not softened. We demonstrate that our correction is able to sink black holes with masses greater than the dark matter particle mass at the correct rate.

Since such a low mass BH cannot be formed via stellar evolution, a model has been proposed based on the core collapse of a neutron star initiated by a certain number of dark matter (DM) particles. In this process, the accumulated DM particles collapse to form a tiny BH inside the neutron star, and the entire neutron star is transmuted into a BH after a certain time due to the accretion of matter by the endoparasitic BH from its host. Here, we argue that, depending on the initial conditions, a dark core collapse could give rise to either a BH or a naked singularity. For example, if the accumulated cloud of DM particles in the core of a neutron star can be modeled as an anisotropic fluid and it fulfils the criterion for collapse, an endoparasitic naked singularity could form instead of an endoparasitic BH. Immediately after its formation, the naked singularity should begin accreting matter from the host neutron star, thus eventually transmuting the entire host into a near-solar mass, relatively slowly-spinning naked singularity. We also propose a general technique to constrain the DM particle--neutron scattering cross section using the lack of pulsars near the Galactic centre and assuming that these missing pulsars have already been transmuted into BHs and/or naked singularities. Thus, the missing pulsars also indicate the existence of many such singularities near the Galactic center.\n\n", "2405.08744": "2024-05-14, **Universal Acceleration and Fuzzy Dark Matter**, Douglas Edmonds et.al., [2405.08744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08744v1)\n\n Observations of velocity dispersions of galactic structures over a wide range of scales point to the existence of a universal acceleration scale $a\\_0\\sim 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$.

In particular primordial black holes (PBHs), which originate from the very early Universe, may constitute (at least in part) dark matter. The possibility that dark matter is made of black holes is particularly appealing, and multi-messenger searches are important to probe this hypothesis. In this paper I will discuss the concept of primordial black holes, their origins, their characteristics and the current constraints.

In this model, choosing a suitable function for non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(\\phi)$ gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during the FR stage is amplified in comparison with slow-roll (SR) stage. Hence, seeds of PBHs production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter (DM), microlensing effects, LIGO-VIRGO events and NANOGrav 15 year data can be formed. The density spectrum of GWs related to one case of the model lies in the NANOGrav 15 year domain and behaves like $\\Omega\\_{\\rm GW\\_0}\\sim f^{5-\\gamma}$. The spectral index $\\gamma=3.42$ for this case satisfies the NANOGrav 15 year constraint.

We focus on five galaxy clusters from the X-COP sample, for which high-quality data are available on both the baryonic mass distribution (gas and stars) and internal dynamics (from the hydrostatic equilibrium of hot gas and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect). We confirm that galaxy clusters require additional `missing matter' in MOND, although the required amount is drastically reduced with respect to the non-baryonic dark matter in the context of Newtonian dynamics. We studied the spatial distribution of the missing matter by fitting the acceleration profiles of the clusters with a Bayesian method, finding that a physical density profile with an inner core and an outer $r^{-4}$ decline (giving a finite total mass) provide good fits within $\\sim$1 Mpc. At larger radii, the fit results are less satisfactory but the combination of the MOND external field effect and hydrostatic bias (quantified as 10$\\%$-40$\\%$) can play a key role. The missing mass must be more centrally concentrated than the intracluster medium (ICM). For relaxed clusters (A1795, A2029, A2142), the ratio of missing-to-visible mass is around $1-5$ at $R\\simeq200-300$ kpc and decreases to $0.4-1.1$ at $R\\simeq2-3$ Mpc, showing that the total amount of missing mass is smaller than or comparable to the ICM mass. For clusters with known merger signatures (A644 and A2319), this global ratio increases up to $\\sim$5 but may indicate out-of-equilibrium dynamics rather than actual missing mass.

An intriguing variation of this scenario is the mass-varying dark matter model where the dark matter mass varies with time during its cosmic history. This is realized in multiple particle physics models. In this work, we study the cosmological constraints on such a model where the dark matter mass transitions from zero to a finite value in the early Universe. In this model, the matter power spectrum exhibits power suppression below a scale that depends on the epoch of transition, and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background show a distinctive phase shift. We use the latest cosmic microwave background and the weak lensing data to place lower limit on the transition redshift and ease the $S\\_8$ tension, unlike the warm dark matter model. This analysis also facilitates a marginal detection of the dark matter (DM) mass. Our findings reveal that while Planck data alone reduces the $S\\_8$ tension to approximately $2\\sigma$, it does not sufficiently constrain the DM mass. However, when combined with the $S\\_8$ measurement from KIDS1000+BOSS+2dfLenS, the tension significantly decreases to roughly $1.3\\sigma$, and we observe the detection of a DM mass at $41.7^{+7.81}\\_{-27.5}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.

We present explicit results up to sixth order, and provide an algorithmic procedure for arbitrarily higher orders. The resulting displacement field is expressed as an expansion in operators built up from the linear density field, with time-dependent coefficients that can be obtained, in a specific model, by solving ordinary differential equations. The derived structure is general enough to cover a wide spectrum of models beyond $\\Lambda$CDM, including modified gravity scenarios of the Hordenski type and models with multiple dark matter species.

We derive the shape function for fuzzy wormholes and explore their possible stability. We study the embedding diagrams of the active gravitational mass associated with fuzzy dark matter wormholes by taking a certain shape function. Aiming to highlight the role of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity in the modeling of less complex fuzzy wormhole structures, we evaluate the complexity factor, the conservation equation, and null energy conditions. Our study reinforces more importance of uniformly distributed pressure effects throughout the less complex region than to the emergence of energy density homogeneity in the stability of fuzzy wormholes. It is shown that the active gravitational mass of the fuzzy wormhole structures varies inversely with the radial distance thereby suggesting the breaching of energy conditions at some arena of Einasto index. Furthermore, it is revealed that stable fuzzy dark matter wormhole structures exist in nature in the surroundings of cold dark matter halos and galactic bulges. The important physics understood from our analysis is that in both four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity, feasible geometries of fuzzy dark matter wormholes exist naturally in the environments of different galactic haloes.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2405.09082": "2024-05-15, **A closer look at the host-galaxy environment of high-velocity Type Ia supernovae**, Han-Tang Lin et.al., [2405.09082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09082v1)\n\n Recent studies suggested that the ejecta velocity of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) is a promising indicator in distinguishing the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms.

Our results reveal a possible trend (at $2.4\\sigma$ significance) that HV SNe Ia are likely associated with older stellar populations than NV SNe Ia. While the trend is inconclusive, the local host-galaxy sample studied in this work is likely skewed toward massive galaxies, limiting the parameter space that we would like to investigate from the original parent sample.

To extract the properties of proto-neutron stars produced via core-collapse supernovae by asteroseismology, we perform a linear perturbation analysis using data obtained from two-dimensional numerical simulations. We employ 12 and 20 solar-mass progenitors and compare two different treatments of gravity. One is a general relativistic one with a conformal flatness condition and the other is an effective gravitational potential mimicking the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solution. We discuss how the frequencies of the proto-neutron star oscillations corresponding to the gravitational wave signals in the simulations depend on the proto-neutron star properties. In our models, we find that the gravitational wave frequencies of the proto-neutron stars determined with the Cowling approximation can be expressed to very good approximation as a function of the proto-neutron star average density almost independently of the progenitor mass, treatment of gravity in the simulations, and the interpolations in the simulations. On the other hand, if one considers the gravitational wave frequencies as a function of the surface gravity of proto-neutron stars, such a relation appears sensitive to the treatment of gravity and other numerical details in the simulations. Thus, the average density of proto-neutron stars seems more suitable for universally expressing the supernova gravitational wave frequencies, instead of the surface gravity.\n\n", "2405.08974": "2024-05-14, **Discovery of $\\sim$2200 new supernova remnants in 19 nearby star-forming galaxies with MUSE spectroscopy**, Jing Li et.al., [2405.08974v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08974v1)\n\n We present the largest extragalactic survey of supernova remnant (SNR) candidates in nearby star-forming galaxies using exquisite spectroscopic maps from MUSE.
