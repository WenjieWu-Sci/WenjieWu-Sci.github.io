The photodisintergation of nuclei occurs at energies above a few PeV, which explains the 1-100 TeV energies of the observed neutrinos. The gamma-ray flux accompanying the beta decays is expected to be much lower than the neutrino flux, and it agrees well with the gamma-ray observations of NGC 1068.

Frameworks of oscillation analyses strongly rely on Monte Carlo neutrino event generators, which provide theoretical predictions of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Thus, it is crucial to integrate state-of-the-art single-pion production models with Monte Carlo simulations to prepare for the upcoming systematics-dominated landscape of neutrino measurements. In this work, we present the implementation of the Ghent Hybrid model for neutrino-induced single-pion production in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The interaction dynamics includes coherently-added contributions from nucleon resonances and a non-resonant background, merged into the pythia branching predictions in the deep-inelastic regime, as instrumented by NuWro. This neutrino-nucleon interaction model is fully incorporated into the nuclear framework of the generator, allowing it to account for the influence of both initial- and final-state nuclear medium effects. We compare the predictions of this integrated implementation with recent pion production data from accelerator-based neutrino experiments. The results of the novel model show improved agreement of the generator predictions with the data and point to the significance of the refined treatment of the description of pion-production processes beyond the $\\Delta$ region.\n\n", "2405.05000": "2024-05-08, **Neutrino Oscillations as a Gravitational Wave Detector?**, Dominik Hellmann et.al., [2405.05000v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05000v1)\n\n Gravitational Waves (GWs) can alter the neutrino propagation distance and thus affect neutrino oscillations. This can result in a complete disappearance of the oscillatory behavior that competes with other sources of neutrino decoherence.

While passing through Earth, multi-GeV neutrinos encounter Earth matter effects due to the coherent forward scattering with the ambient electrons, which alter the neutrino oscillation probabilities. These matter effects depend upon the density distribution of electrons inside Earth, and hence, can be used to determine the internal structure of Earth. In this work, we employ a five-layered model of Earth where the layer densities and radii are modified, keeping the mass and moment of inertia of Earth unchanged and respecting the hydrostatic equilibrium condition. We use the proposed INO-ICAL detector as an example of an atmospheric neutrino experiment that can distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos efficiently in the multi-GeV energy range. Our analysis demonstrates the role such an experiment can play in simultaneously constraining the density jumps inside Earth and the location of the core-mantle boundary.\n\n", "2405.04978": "2024-05-08, **Formal Theory of Heavy Ion Double Charge Exchange Reactions**, Horst Lenske et.al., [2405.04978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04978v1)\n\n The theory of heavy ion double charge exchange (DCE) reactions $A(Z,N)\\to A(Z\\pm 2,N\\mp 2)$ is recapitulated emphasizing the role of Double Single Charge Exchange (DSCE) and pion-nucleon Majorana DCE (MDCE) reactions.

Comparing Individualist and Collective Bounds on Broadcast Populations in Single Galaxies**, Brian C. Lacki et.al., [2405.04651v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04651v1)\n\n The search for extraterrestrial intelligence includes efforts to constrain populations of artificial broadcasts in other galaxies. Previous efforts use individualist methods, searching for single broadcasts with high signal-to-noise ratio. These would be detected as observables with extreme values. This approach is limited to very bright broadcasts and also is subject to confusion, where a large number of broadcasts blend together to form a noise continuum. The mean value of the total emission provides an additional collective bound: the luminosity of the transmitters is no higher than the galaxy's observed luminosity. Using the framework developed in Paper I, I evaluate how confusion affects individualist searches. I then compare individualist and collective approaches for radio broadcasts from the Milky Way, M31, and three Virgo Cluster elliptical galaxies. For current observations, confusion blurs narrowband radio broadcasts together in the Virgo ellipticals when there is one broadcast per gigahertz per 1000 stars. The collective bound implies fewer than $\\sim 10^6 (\\overline{\\ell}/10^{13} W)^{-1}$ L-band broadcasts per star gigahertz GHz in the Milky Way and is about 10 and 400 times stronger in M31 and M59, respectively. Applying the collective bound to the far-infrared--radio correlation yields constraints on radio broadcast populations in star-forming galaxies throughout the Universe. The collective bound allows us to rule out large regions of broadcast population parameter space even for distant galaxies. It also imposes constraints on gamma-ray, neutrino, and gravitational-wave broadcasts in the nearest galaxies.\n\n", "2405.04568": "2024-05-07, **Relic Neutrino Background from Cosmic-Ray Reservoirs**, Andrea Giovanni De Marchi et.al., [2405.04568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04568v1)\n\n We compute the flux of relic neutrino background (R$\\nu$B) up-scattered by ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) in clusters that act as CR-reservoirs.

The new neutrino state is devoid of all Standard Model (SM) interactions, commonly referred to as a 'sterile' state. In addition, a sterile neutrino with a mass-squared difference of $10^{-2}$ $\\rm eV^2$ has been proposed to improve the tension between the results obtained from the Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) and the NuMI Off-axis $\\nu\\_e$ Appearance (NO$\\nu$A) experiments. Further, the non-observation of the predicted upturn in the solar neutrino spectra below 8 MeV can be explained by postulating an extra light sterile neutrino state with a mass-squared difference around $10^{-5} \\rm eV^2$. The hypothesis of an additional light sterile neutrino state introduces four distinct mass spectra depending on the sign of the mass-squared difference.

Their primary function is to convert coherent quantum superpositions into incoherent ones, with the result that macroscopic objects cannot be placed into widely separated superpositions for observably prolonged times. Many of these processes will also lead to loss of coherence in neutrino oscillations, producing observable signatures in the flavor profile of neutrinos at long travel distances. The majority of studies of neutrino oscillation coherence to date have focused on variants of the continuous state localization model, whereby an effective decoherence strength parameter is used to model the rate of coherence loss with an assumed energy dependence. Another class of collapse models that have been proposed posit connections to the configuration of gravitational field accompanying the mass distribution associated with each wave function that is in the superposition. A particularly interesting and prescriptive model is Penrose's description of gravitational collapse which proposes a decoherence time $\\tau$ determined through $E\\_{g}\\tau\\sim\\hbar$, where $E\\_{g}$ is a calculable function of the Newtonian gravitational potential.

A less explored avenue is their application to discriminative tasks involving regression or classification problems. The cornerstone of modern cosmology is the ability to generate predictions for observed astrophysical fields from theory and constrain physical models from observations using these predictions. This work uses a single diffusion generative model to address these interlinked objectives -- as a surrogate model or emulator for cold dark matter density fields conditional on input cosmological parameters, and as a parameter inference model that solves the inverse problem of constraining the cosmological parameters of an input field. The model is able to emulate fields with summary statistics consistent with those of the simulated target distribution. We then leverage the approximate likelihood of the diffusion generative model to derive tight constraints on cosmology by using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to sample the posterior on cosmological parameters for a given test image.

In analogy to the Schwarzschild solution, these metrics describe a static vacuum spacetime and apply in similar settings except for the changed symmetry conditions. Analyzing the low-velocity limit corresponding to the Newtonian approximation of the Schwarzschild metric, we find an effective logarithmic potential. This yields flat rotation curves for test particles undergoing rotational motion within the spacetime described by the line elements, in contrast to Newtonian rotation curves. This analysis highlights how important the symmetry assumptions are for deriving general relativistic solutions.   One example of physical objects that are generally described in the static vacuum low-velocity limit (reducing to Newtonian gravity in the spherically symmetric case) and exhibit axial symmetry are disk galaxies. We show that symmetries and appropriate line elements that respect them are crucial to consider in such settings. In particular, the solutions presented here result in flat rotation curves without any need for dark matter.

The latter is determined as a solution of Poisson's equation modelling, e.g., non-relativistic gravity. For reasons of complexity, we treat a one-dimensional version of the problem whose numerical integration is still challenging because of the extreme long-range forces (being constant in the asymptotic limit). Both of our methods, a Strang splitting scheme and a basis function approach using B-splines, are compared in numerical convergence and effectivity. Overall, our Strang-splitting evolution compares favourably with the B-spline method. In particular, by using an adaptive time-stepper rather large one-dimensional boxes can be treated.

Such axi-Higgs fields charged under the anomalous symmetry act as mediators for the Dark Matter annihilation to Standard Model particles and can lead to an efficient freeze-out mechanism. Here, we show that the St{\\\"u}kelberg axion and the resultant axi-Higgs, with its appropriate shift symmetry cancels the quantum anomalies and also generate the observed relic density for the Dark Matter. Moreover, we show that the relevant parameter space in our model, where photon production dominates, is safe from FermiLAT, Cherenkov Telescope Array, and H.E.S.S. indirect detection experiments.\n\n", "2405.04635": "2024-05-07, **Mysterious anomalies in Earth's atmosphere and strongly interacting Dark Matter**, Ariel Zhitnitsky et.al., [2405.04635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04635v1)\n\n It has been recently argued [1-3] that there is a number of mysterious observations which are very hard to explain by conventional physics. The mysterious anomalies include (but not limited) to such unexpected correlations as temperature variation in stratosphere, the total electron content (TEC) of the Earths atmosphere, the earthquake activity from one hand, and positions of the planets from another hand. It has been hypothesized in [1-3] that the corresponding mysterious correlations is a result of the \"streaming invisible matter\" which suddenly become very strongly interacting material when enter the Earth's atmosphere. We propose that some of these (and many other) mysteries might be result of rare (but energetic) events when the so-called axion quark nuggets (AQN) hit the Earth. In different words, we identify \"streaming invisible matter\" conjectured by [1-3] with the AQNs. Therefore, we offer a specific microscopical mechanism which could shed some light on the mysterious correlations reported in [1-3]. One should emphasize that the AQN model was originally invented long ago to explain the observed similarity between the dark and the visible components in the Universe, i.e. $\\Omega\\_{\\rm DM}\\sim \\Omega\\_{\\rm visible}$; it was not invented to fit the observed anomalies which represent the topic of this work.

Heavy dark sector particles with masses above $10^4$ GeV can come to dominate the Universe and yield an early matter-dominated era before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Density perturbations in this epoch can grow and collapse into tiny dark matter halos, which cool via self interactions. The typical halo size is set by the Hubble length once perturbations begin growing, offering a straightforward prediction of the halo size and evolution depending on ones choice of dark matter model. Once these primordial halos have formed, a thermal phase transition can then shift the Universe back into radiation domination and standard cosmology. These halos can continue to collapse after BBN, resulting in the late-time formation of fragmented dark compact objects and sub-solar mass primordial black holes. We find that these compact objects can constitute a sizable fraction of all of dark matter. The resulting fragments can have masses between $10^{20}$ g to $10^{32}$ g, with radii ranging from $10^{-2}$ m to $10^5$ m, while the black holes can have masses between $10^{8}$ g to $10^{34}$ g. Furthermore, a unique feature of this model is the late-time formation of black holes which can evaporate away today.

In this paper, we derive constraints on millicharged fermion dark matter models with massless dark photon using gravitational positivity bounds. Combining them with upper bounds from cosmological and astrophysical observations, we can severely constrain the parameter space of the model.

However, significant uncertainties can arise from the choice of lens model, and in particular the parameterisation of the line of sight. In this work, we consider the consequences of ignoring the contribution of foreground perturbers in lens modelling. We derive the explicit form of the degeneracy between the foreground shear and the ellipticity of a power law lens, which renders both quantities effectively unmeasurable from strong lensing observables. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that this degeneracy does not affect measurements of the Einstein radius. Foreground tidal effects are also not expected to bias the slope of the potential, and further that any biases in this slope should not affect the recovery of the Hubble constant. The foreground convergence term adds an additional uncertainty to the measurement of $H\\_0$, and we show that this uncertainty will be on the order of $1\\%$ for lensing systems located along random lines of sight.

It has quite recently been noticed, that they can not only successfully explain the large-scale structure in the Universe, but can also solve problems of position and flux anomalies in galaxy strong lensing systems. In this paper we focus on the perturbation of time delays in strong lensing systems caused by fuzzy dark matter, thus making an important extension of previous works. We select a specific system HS 0810+2554 for the study of time delay anomalies. Then, based on the nature of the fuzzy dark matter fluctuations, we obtain theoretical relationship between the magnitude of the perturbation caused by fuzzy dark matter, its content in the galaxy, and its de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda \\_{\\mathrm{dB}}$.

In addition, we trace long-standing precursor emission at the position of SN 2023fyq using data from DLT40, ATLAS, ZTF, ASAS-SN, Swift, and amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki. Precursor activity is observed up to nearly three years before the supernova explosion, with a relatively rapid rise in the final 100 days. The double-peaked post-explosion light curve reaches a luminosity of $\\sim10^{43}~\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$. The strong intermediate-width He lines observed in the nebular spectrum of SN 2023fyq imply the interaction is still active at late phases. We found that the precursor activity in SN 2023fyq is best explained by the mass transfer in a binary system involving a low-mass He star and a compact companion. An equatorial disk is likely formed in this process ($\\sim$0.6$\\rm M\\_{\\odot}$), and the interaction of SN ejecta with this disk powers the main peak of the supernova.

We simulate Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the proposed Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Deep Drilling Field (DDF), and evaluate astrometric redshifts. We find that the redshift accuracy improves dramatically with the statistical quality of the astrometric measurements as well as with the accuracy of the astrometric solution. For a conservative choice of a 5-mas systematic uncertainty floor, we find that our redshift estimation is accurate at $z < 0.6$. We then combine our astrometric redshifts with both host galaxy photometric redshifts and supernovae photometric (light-curve) redshifts and show that this considerably improves the overall redshift estimates.

Surveys at high-cadence catch massive stars at shock breakout and inform us on the immediate mass loss history before core collapse. In contrast, long-term monitoring of these SNe cover the transition to the birth of a SN remnant and document the progenitor mass loss that took place centuries to millennia before explosion.
