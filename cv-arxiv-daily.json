In this work, we explore how this fog is modified when either neutrinos or DM interact with nuclei through a new scalar, vector, or axial-vector interaction, considering both heavy and light mediators. Using the latest nuclear-recoil data from XENONnT, which show indications of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from $^8$B solar neutrinos, we derive new strong bounds on light mediator couplings. We find that these limits are significantly more stringent when the mediator couples to DM, rather than when new physics affects only neutrino interactions. Building on these results, we recompute the expected neutrino fog and compare it with the corresponding constraints on spin-independent and spin-dependent DM-nucleon interactions. We show that the morphology of the neutrino fog can be markedly modified if either neutrinos or DM interact with nuclei through light mediators, even in light of these recent constraints.\n\n", "2512.08822": "2025-12-09, **A search for successful and choked jets in nearby broad-lined Type Ic supernovae**, Tanner O'Dwyer et.al., [2512.08822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08822v1)\n\n The observational link between long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and broad-lined stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) is well established. Significant progress has been made in constraining what fraction of SNe Ic-BL may power high- or low-luminosity GRBs when viewed at small off-axis angles. However, the GRB-SN connection still lacks a complete understanding in the broader context of massive-star evolution and explosion physics. Models predict a continuum of outcomes for the fastest ejecta, from choked to ultra-relativistic jets, and observations from radio to X-rays are key to probing these scenarios across a range of viewing angles and velocities. Here, we present results from a coordinated radio-to-X-ray campaign targeting nearby (z<=0.1) SNe Ic-BL designed to explore this diversity. With eight new radio-monitored events and updated data for one previously observed SN, we further tighten constraints on the fraction of SNe Ic-BL as relativistic as SN 1998bw/GRB 980425. We identify SN 2024rjw as a new radio-loud event likely powered by strong interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), and add evidence supporting a similar interpretation for SN 2020jqm. We also establish new limits on the properties of radio-emitting ejecta with velocities consistent with cocoons from choked jets, highlighting SN 2022xxf as a promising cocoon-dominated candidate. These results refine our understanding of the continuum linking ordinary SNe Ic-BL, engine-driven explosions, and GRBs, and contribute to building a sample that will inform future multi-messenger searches for electromagnetic counterparts to high-energy neutrinos.\n\n", "2512.08780": "2025-12-09, **Neutrino pair bremsstrahlung due to electromagnetic collisions in neutron star cores revisited**, P.

Two limiting cases are considered: (i) protons are in the normal state and (ii) protons are in the superconducting state. In both cases, the dominant contribution to the bremsstrahlung emissivity $Q^{\\mathrm{em}}\\_{\\mathrm{Br}}$ comes from the transverse part of in-medium electromagnetic interactions. For non-superconducting matter, we obtain an unusual $Q^{\\mathrm{em}}\\_{\\mathrm{Br}}\\propto T^{23/3}$ temperature dependence due to the dynamical character of plasma screening in the transverse channel, but considerably smaller values of $Q^{\\mathrm{em}}\\_{\\mathrm{Br}}$ than in previous studies, rendering the considered process unimportant in practice. In contrast, for superconducting and superfluid matter, the neutrino emission processes involving nucleons are suppressed and $Q^{\\mathrm{em}}\\_{\\mathrm{Br}}$ due to lepton collisions provides the residual contribution to the neutrino emissivity of neutron star core matter. In the superconducting case, the plasma screening becomes static and the standard $Q^{\\mathrm{em}}\\_{\\mathrm{Br}}\\propto T^{8}$ temperature scaling is restored.

In this work, we move beyond the two-parameter Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) form adopted in recent DESI analyses and re-examine neutrino mass constraints using a flexible four-parameter dark energy equation of state (4pDE). We implement the 4pDE model in a modified version of CLASS and perform a full MCMC analysis using Planck, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon+ data. Relative to our previous 4pDE study based on pre-DESI BAO datasets, the inclusion of DESI DR2 substantially tightens the constraints on the transition parameters while still yielding a relaxed neutrino-mass bound compared to $\u039b$CDM, $\\sum m\\_\u03bd< 0.101$ eV ($95\\%$ C.L.). This upper limit is more stringent than the DESI DR2 constraint obtained within the $w\\_0w\\_a$CDM framework.

To explain the observed lepton mass spectra and flavor mixing patterns, flavor symmetry plays a crucial and unique role. In this paper, we propose a useful symmetry-breaking scheme by applying $S\\_{3L} \\times S\\_{3R} \\rightarrow S\\_{2L} \\times S\\_{2R} \\rightarrow \\emptyset$ within both charged-lepton and neutrino sectors at the mass-matrix level.

It is shown that all the three scenarios are in good agreement with current neutrino oscillation data.

In superluminal scenarios, neutrinos can decay through vacuum $e^-e^+$ pair emission or neutrino splitting. Previous analyses of the KM3-230213A event relied on simplified survival-probability estimates and, in some cases, used inaccurate decay-width expressions or neglected redshift and threshold effects. In this work we present a unified and self-consistent framework that corrects these issues and applies to both the energy-independent ($n=0$) and quadratic ($n=2$) superluminal cases. We collect and recast the decay-width and threshold expressions, clarify their flavor dependence, and include a consistent treatment of cosmological propagation. We also assess the impact of cascade regeneration and show that cascade effects are negligible for the purpose of setting LIV bounds. The survival-probability approximation adopted in previous works is therefore justified, while our framework provides a coherent basis for future analyses of superluminal neutrino constraints, which should consistently include possible time-delay signatures.\n\n", "2512.08361": "2025-12-09, **Impact of antiparticle degrees of freedom on neutrino flavor oscillations in frames of quantum field theory**, Maxim Dvornikov et.al., [2512.08361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08361v1)\n\n We study neutrino flavor oscillations using the approach based on the quantum field theory (QFT), where neutrinos are taken to be virtual particles. One deals with the propagators of neutrino mass eigenstates in this formalism. Previously, while applying this approach to neutrino oscillations in external fields, we decomposed the propagators and used only the particle contribution in the calculation of the matrix element. In the present work, we carefully justify the validity of this kind of transformation by considering neutrino oscillations in vacuum.

In particular, GWs induced by primordial isocurvature perturbations encode information of novel dynamics beyond the standard $\u039b$CDM model. Existing studies of isocurvature induced GWs focus on a particular type: cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature. In this work, we present a more comprehensive study of four kinds of isocurvature involving CDM, baryons, neutrinos and free-streaming dark radiation (DR). We first reformulate initial conditions of isocurvature with coupled neutrinos because modes relevant for observations at Pulsar Timing Arrays enter the horizon before neutrino decoupling. With these new initial conditions, neutrino isocurvature is phenomenologically similar to CDM isocurvature up to an overall coefficient, which leads to an interesting conversion of isocurvature between radiation and matter sectors. We then find that the spectrum of isocurvature induced GWs from free-streaming DR is qualitatively different than that from CDM due to the presence of anisotropic stress. Unlike GWs induced by CDM isocurvature that are suppressed at high frequencies due to matter density being suppressed at early times, DR isocurvature induced GWs is proportional to the constant ratio between DR density and total radiation. Finally, we utilize two general parametrizations of the isocurvature power spectrum: a delta function and a broken power law, and derive novel constraints with recent NANOGrav data.

We set world-leading limits on spin-independent and spin-dependent-neutron DM-nucleon interactions for masses down to 5 GeV/$c^2$. In the no-dark-matter scenario, we observe a signal consistent with $^{8}$B CE$\u03bd$NS events, corresponding to a $4.5\u03c3$ statistical significance.

Although several sources show ~100 TeV gamma rays, their hadronic origin is uncertain; a matching neutrino signal would provide definitive evidence. Using insight from the theory of diffusive shock acceleration, we evaluate the spectra and environments of the sample of Galactic SNRs to identify those most likely to be hadronic, categorizing them into a tiered catalog depending on their likelihood to produce neutrinos detectable in the TeV-PeV range. We then calculate the estimated stacked sensitivity of IceCube for each tier using IceCube's ten-year public data. Our results suggest that this strategy of stacking SNRs and carefully excluding leptonic sources by using theoretical arguments may allow for a detection of this source class that would otherwise be impossible. A follow-up analysis of these catalogs using TeV-PeV sensitive neutrino data from IceCube (or similar telescopes like KM3NeT/ARCA) offers the most decisive, near-future test for the hadronic nature of these SNRs and the maximum energies of their CR spectra.\n\n", "2512.07938": "2025-12-08, **Neutrino Effects on Atomic Measurements of the Weinberg Angle**, Mitrajyoti Ghosh et.al., [2512.07938v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07938v1)\n\n We derive a complete expression for the neutrino-mediated quantum force beyond the four-Fermi approximation within the Standard Model.

We investigate the possible association between the Type IIn supernova SN2025cbj and the IceCube high-energy neutrino IceCube-250421A, and assess whether the observed properties of the SN permit an appreciable neutrino yield. Methods. We combined rapid optical follow-up with LAST and archival ZTF photometry with spectroscopy from LT/SPRAT and MMT/BINOSPEC to characterize the SN evolution and CSM interaction. We estimated the explosion and peak times from early light-curve fitting, and quantified the chance-coincidence probability with resampling simulations that scramble neutrino right ascensions while preserving declinations and error contours. Using a simple post-shock-breakout interaction model in a dense wind, we estimated the expected muon-neutrino yield for IceCube real-time Bronze stream. Results. Spectra of SN2025cbj obtained after the neutrino epoch show persistent narrow Balmer lines superposed on broad Lorentzian electron-scattering wings, consistent with sustained dense-CSM interaction.

Low-energy observables encompass parity-violating M\u00f8ller scattering, muon anomalous magnetic moment, and muonium-antimuonium oscillations. Our combined analysis indicates that for a doubly-charged scalar in the $1$-$3$ TeV range, the flavor-diagonal Yukawa couplings to electrons and muons as small as $10^{-2}$ are accessible.

Quantum-mechanical interference can allow a neutrino of one initial flavour to be detected some time later as a different flavour, a process called neutrino oscillation.

This includes anomalous observations from the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments, consistent with $\u03bd\\_\u03bc\\rightarrow\u03bd\\_{e}$ transitions at a distance inconsistent with the three-neutrino picture.

By mapping the 1024-sample waveforms directly into a 10-qubit Hilbert space, we demonstrate that a VQC with only 302 trainable parameters achieves a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 and a global accuracy of 97.1%. This result demonstrates that even in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, quantum models can match the performance of state-of-the-art classical baselines while reducing model complexity by over two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we envision a scenario where future quantum sensors transmit quantum states directly to such processing units, exploiting the exponentially large Hilbert space in a natively quantum pipeline.\n\n", "2512.08517": "2025-12-09, **On the existence of bound states in SIMP dark sectors**, Xiaoyong Chu et.al., [2512.08517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08517v1)\n\n In strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) scenarios, dark matter is comprised of stable dark pions whose $3\\to 2$ or $4\\to 2$ reactions set the dark matter relic abundance. Recent work has shown that shallow two-pion bound states significantly affect the freeze-out, but did not establish whether such states actually form.

We determine the range of $m\\_\u03c0/f\\_\u03c0$ for which a pole appears below the two-pion threshold, extract the corresponding residue, and, in the non-relativistic limit, obtain the bound-state wave function at the origin, $\\|\u03a8(0)\\|$, which controls bound-state-assisted annihilation and decay rates relevant for catalyzed freeze-out.

However, discovery of binary black holes (BBHs) in 2015 by LIGO has transformed the study of compact objects, with over 300 BBHs recorded, providing a new avenue for probing new physics. GWs remain a prominent and precise method of observing not only BBHs, but also dark matter and cosmic strings. Cosmic strings -- hypothetical one dimensional topological defects formed in the early universe, are yet to be observed, with multiple detection methods such as particle radiation, gravitational waves and lensing being proposed. Here we present a novel framework to search for cosmic strings by modeling them as perturbations within non-rotating black hole spacetime, focusing on their imprint on the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our numerical simulations identify a lower limit on perturbation strength, $\u03bb\\sim 10^{-10}$ for uncharged string and $\u03bb\\sim 10^{-7}$ for charged string, below which cosmic string effects become unobservable in QNM signals. By analyzing eigenvalue splitting and centers, we show that cosmic string properties impart distinct and detectable features to GW signals. Our results establish QNM analysis as a powerful, alternative observational strategy for constraining or detecting cosmic strings, and offer an inverse approach to estimate string energy or charge if a signal is detected.

One promising method to study DM is detecting DM subhalos through their gravitational interactions with stellar streams. In this study, we apply Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) to constrain subhalo interaction parameters, including mass, scale radius, velocity, and encounter geometry, from stellar stream kinematics. We generate particle spray simulations based on the Lagrange Cloud stripping technique, focusing on the ATLAS-Aliqa Uma stream as a test case. We train multiple NPE models across multiple observational scenarios, quantifying how kinematic completeness affects inference and forecasting constraints from upcoming surveys including LSST, 4MOST, and 10-year Gaia data. Our results demonstrate that NPE can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors. In the idealized case with full 6D coordinates, we achieve subhalo mass uncertainties of 15-20% for a $10^7 \\, \\mathrm{M\\_\\odot}$ subhalo, with 5D coordinates (excluding radial velocities) achieving similar performance. Under realistic observational conditions, mass uncertainties range from 50% (present-day) to 20-40% (future scenarios), with comparable performance between the photometric-only LSST sample and a smaller sample that includes Gaia proper motions and 4MOST radial velocities. Most notably, we find that velocity bimodality emerges when phase space is poorly sampled, whether due to missing kinematic information or limited stellar tracers. Combining large photometric samples with targeted spectroscopic follow-up can effectively resolves this degeneracy.

Such an interaction can be radiatively generated if dark matter couples to heavier charged particles. Previous studies have focused on the case where these charged states are much heavier than the reheat temperature, such that freeze-in production of dark matter is sensitive to the ultraviolet details of reheating. Here, we instead consider the possibility that these heavy states have masses comparable to the dark matter mass and are charged under a new kinetically-mixed $U(1)'$. As a result, dark matter production is dominated by the infrared freeze-in of the heavy charged states that subsequently thermalize the rest of the dark sector to a temperature much below that of the visible bath. We delineate regions of parameter space consistent with cosmological and astrophysical constraints and identify benchmark scenarios that can guide the next generation of direct detection experiments searching for spin-dependent scattering of sub-GeV dark matter.\n\n", "2512.07933": "2025-12-08, **Probing the Warm Dark Matter mass with [C II] intensity mapping**, Elena Marcuzzo et.al., [2512.07933v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07933v1)\n\n The nature of dark matter (DM) is still debated. While cold DM (CDM) is the standard paradigm, warm DM (WDM) may ease some small-scale tensions in the $\u039b$CDM framework. Line-intensity mapping (LIM) offers a novel probe of DM properties.

In a CDM universe, the DSS yields lower limits on $m\\_\\mathrm{WDM}$ at $95\\%$ credibility level (CL) of $1.10$ keV and $0.58$ keV when considering the optimistic and pessimistic LF ($\u03b1= -1.1$), respectively.

Poincare surfaces of section reveal transitions between regular and chaotic motions that depend sensitively on the vorton tension $G\u03bc$ and initial conditions. We further compute the Lense-Thirring and general spin-precession frequencies for gyroscopes along Killing trajectories. The resulting precession profiles exhibit several distinct features not present in Kerr black holes but reminiscent of Kerr naked singularities, such as: divergences near the ring core, and multi-minima structures.

Motivated by the fact that, even for QCD pi-pi scattering, LO ChPT near threshold underestimates the isoscalar s-wave amplitude by an O(1) factor relative to high-precision dispersive results, we reassess the phenomenology of dark-pion dark matter in SIMP and WIMP scenarios using the chiral unitary method, a nonperturbative resummation that implements the correct analytic structure with minimal input, and quantify how unitarization modifies the standard LO ChPT picture. We fix the subtraction constant to its natural estimate, interpreted as an effective cutoff at the chiral scale, so that the unitarized amplitudes depend only on the dark-pion mass and decay constant. We show that, depending on the coupling, the unitarized amplitudes develop resonance poles absent at LO, leading to sizable departures in 2-to-2 self-scattering, relevant for SIMP scenarios, and in annihilation including initial-state interaction effects, relevant for WIMP scenarios. These modifications, in turn, affect the viable parameter space.

The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves.

These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos.

Variation with respect to the metric, supplemented by small perturbations, produces the equations of motion and the terms that determine the propagation speed of tensor perturbations. The resulting Hubble parameter incorporates contributions from stiff matter and dark energy, the last originating from a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The viability of the model is assessed by using Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and type Ia supernovae data. Best model selection based on information criteria indicates a slight preference for this new framework over the $\u039b$ Cold Dark Matter model. Stability of the model follows from the positive speed of sound and absence of ``Ostrogradsky ghosts''.

This universality persists across the dark matter parameter space explored in this study and is largely insensitive to the choice of nuclear equation of state.

However, very few mid- and late-type B stars with rapid rotation have been demonstrated to be post-interaction products, despite a growing sample of SB1 binaries among stars within this range of spectral types. By considering the currently available information over the entire range of rapidly rotating B-type binaries, we argue that a significant fraction of the mid- and late-type rapid rotators found in binaries are also likely the result of past mass transfer episodes.

Prospects for directly detecting and characterizing the stripped cores of the previous mass donors in such systems are described, and the implications for the role of binary interaction in causing rapid rotation are discussed.

Motivated by these theoretical considerations, we present a comprehensive analysis of their thermal production in the early universe. Our calculation covers a broad range of dark photon masses from 0.1 keV to 100 MeV and include inverse decay, annihilation, and semi-Compton processes. Wherever possible, we present analytical estimates of the production rates and yields, and verify their accuracy numerically. For dark photons lighter than twice the electron masses (around 1 MeV), we find that our analytical estimate of the freeze-in yield based on resonant production is very accurate, implying that off-resonance contributions can be neglected in practice. For heavy dark photons, although this conclusion no longer holds, we derive an interesting ratio, $4\u03c0e/27\\approx0.14$, with $e$ the coupling constant of QED, that can be used to estimate the relative importance of on- and off-resonance contributions. Finally, using the calculated abundance of dark photons in the early universe, we derive cosmological constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing.

We have separately examined the dynamical processes for collisions between NSs and helium WDs (He-WDs), carbon-oxygen WDs (CO-WDs), and oxygen-neon WDs (ONe-WDs). We aim to investigate whether the collision can trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD, and if not, whether the NS can remain bound within the WD to form a Thorne-Zytkow-like object (TZlO). For a thermonuclear explosion to occur, at least two conditions must be satisfied: (i) the collision-induced temperature must reach the ignition threshold of the relevant nuclear reactions, and (ii) the burning material must remain in a degenerate state. For different types of WDs, there exist parameter ranges where both conditions are fulfilled, implying that NS-WD collisions can indeed induce thermonuclear explosions, leading to sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae or other exotic optical transients powered by thermonuclear explosion. On the other hand, the formation of a TZlO requires that the WD material exerts sufficient drag on the NS to prevent its escape, while the interaction must not trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD.

We examine global differences between the models, and investigate the impacts on star formation. We include a time-dependent, non-equilibrium chemical network coupled to a thermal evolution scheme and supernova feedback. Our magnetic field amplifies via dynamo action from a small initial seed field. We find a more compact magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disc (radius ~ 5.1kpc, compared to ~ 7.4kpc), with a diffuse atomic envelope above and below the plane that is not seen in the hydrodynamic (HD) case. The HD disc displays a smoother, more even radial distribution of gas and star formation, and more bubbly substructure. Our MHD simulation has a higher proportion of dense, gravitationally unbound gas than the HD case, but a lower star formation rate, an average between 125-150Myr of ~ 4.8 solar masses per year, compared to ~ 8.4 solar masses per year.

The additional magnetic support against gravitational collapse seems to raise the threshold gas surface density required for star formation.\n\n", "2512.07945": "2025-12-08, **On the missing dust of super-early galaxies: Supernova blowout and gas-dust venting in Blue Monsters**, Sergio Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez et.al., [2512.07945v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07945v1)\n\n A subset of very young, super-early galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$, often termed Blue Monsters, shows extremely blue UV continua and faint far-IR emission, which could imply much less dust than expected from standard enrichment scenarios. We seek to understand the possible reason behind the apparent absence of dust in the Blue Monsters. We show how clustered supernovae drive mechanical blowout in stratified, self-gravitating clouds by combining full 3-D hydrodynamical dust-survival yields with 3-D thin-shell scalings, and we predict the retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio at the cluster scale and the corresponding galaxy-integrated value. We take the net dust yield per unit stellar mass from existing 3-D hydrodynamical studies of young stellar clusters with sequential supernovae, and we set the blowout radius as a function of gas concentration using established 3-D thin-shell scalings. Assuming gas-dust coupling across the blowout boundary, the retained dust-to-stellar ratio accounts for the fraction of supernovae that remain confined versus those that vent mechanically. Across typical cluster masses, sizes, and cloud-scale star formation efficiencies, mechanical venting removes a large share of gas and dust. The retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio is lowered by about half to two orders of magnitude relative to the supernova net dust yield. The outcome depends mainly on gas concentration and only weakly on metallicity, so it remains effective at low $Z$. After weighting by a Schechter cluster mass function and a Weibull core-radius distribution, the galaxy-integrated value falls in the same range inferred for spectroscopically confirmed Blue Monsters. Thus, mechanical venting at the cluster scale can account for the very low dust fractions inferred for Blue Monsters without requiring extreme in situ destruction and without fine-tuning.\n\n", "2512.07931": "2025-12-08, **Evidence for evolving Dark Energy from a new cosmic probe**, Isaque Dutra et.al., [2512.07931v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07931v1)\n\n The $\u039b$CDM concordance cosmological model provides a remarkably successful description of the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe. However, a growing discrepancy between measurements of the expansion rate $H\\_0$ from the near and distant Universe now appears to be significant at the ~4-7 $\u03c3$ level. This inconsistency, known as the ``Hubble tension'', has arisen either due to unrecognized systematics in these measurements or new physics beyond the standard model, such as an evolving dark energy equation of state. Modeling ~20-year, multi-band optical light curves for 6992 active galactic nuclei (AGN), we find a tight relation linking the variability amplitude and characteristic timescale to their intrinsic luminosity. This empirical law enables us to construct an AGN-based Hubble diagram to z ~3.5. Joint inference with supernova distances reveals evidence for an evolving dark energy equation of state at the 3.8-3.9 $\u03c3$ level over constant w models and 4.4-4.8 $\u03c3$ over $\u039b$CDM. Our results establish AGN light curves as a powerful tool for cosmography that could offer a novel pathway to test deviations from the standard $\u039b$CDM expansion history.\n\n", "2512.07696": "2025-12-08, **ZTF-SEDm Type Ia supernova sample for Twins Embedding spectrophotometric standardisation**, C. Ganot et.al., [2512.07696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07696v1)\n\n This paper has two aims: the first one is to build a large homogeneous spectrophotometric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, using 3069 spectra from the second Zwicky Transient Facility data release (ZTF DR2). Using this sample we reproduce, as the second objective of the paper, the Twins Embedding (TE) spectrophotometric standardisation method, which led to an exceptionally low value of 0.073 mag for the intrinsic scatter. We improve the flux-calibration accuracy of the SEDm SN Ia spectral sample using the ZTF photometric data, which are calibrated at the percent level. We then apply the three steps of the TE parameterisation to a subset of 783 ZTF SN spectra near maximum light, and analyse the resulting standardisation methods. The precision of the phase correction model, which is the first step of the TE, is estimated at 0.01 mag in g band, using ZTF data. Despite the challenge posed by the ZTF spectrum extraction pipeline, we apply a first standardisation in color based on the second step of the TE, the Read Between The Lines (RBTL). When considering the scatter due to the redshift error and the flux calibration error, we estimate a 0.129 mag Hubble residual scatter for this ZTF sample as an upper limit. As expected from the low spectral quality, the final TE standardisation based on three non-linear parameters did not improve the overall dispersion. We release 1897 flux calibrated spectra of 1607 SNe Ia with an estimated photometric accuracy of 0.07 mag. We further demonstrate the ability to apply a spectrophotometric standardisation with limited quality spectra. The RBTL standardisation is more efficient than that of SALT with one less parameter, and the resulting host steps are consistent with zero, making it less prone to astrophysical bias. For future spectroscopic surveys, a better spectral quality would enable the full TE standardisation to be computed.

Cosentino et.al., [2512.07562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07562v1)\n\n Low-velocity shocks from Supernova Remnants (SNRs) may set the physical and chemical conditions of star formation in molecular clouds. Recent evidence suggests that the Sun might have formed through this process. However, the chemical conditions of shock-induced star forming region remain poorly constrained. We study the chemical complexity of a shock-impacted clump, with potential to yield star formation, named the Clump, and located at the interface between the SNR W44 and the infrared dark cloud G034.77-00.55. We test whether the Clump has chemical properties consistent with those observed in star forming regions unaffected by SNRs. We use high-sensitivity, broad spectral surveys at 3 and 7 mm obtained with the 30m antenna at IIRAM and the 40 m YEBES antenna, to identify D-bearing species and complex organic molecules (COMs) toward the Clump. For all species, we estimate molecular abundances and compare them with those observed across star forming regions at different evolutionary stages and masses, as well as comets. We detect multiple deuterated molecules (DCO+, DNC, DCN, CH2DOH) and COMs (CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3CCH, CH3CN, CH3SH) with excitation temperatures of 5-13 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of COMs toward a site of SNR-cloud interaction. The derived D/H ratios (0.01-0.04) and COM abundances are consistent with those reported toward typical low-mass starless cores and comparable to cometary values. The overall level of chemical complexity is relatively low, in line with an early evolutionary stage. We suggest that the Clump is a early stage shock-induced low-mass star forming region, not yet protostellar. We speculate that SNR shocks may set the physical and chemical conditions to form stars. The resulting chemical budget may be preserved along the formation process of a planetary system, being finally incorporated into planetesimals and cometesimals.\n\n", "2512.07281": "2025-12-08, **Dynamical Dark Energy and the Unresolved Hubble Tension: Multi-model Constraints from DESI 2025 and Other Probes**, Zhuoming Zhang et.al., [2512.07281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07281v1)\n\n We present a Bayesian comparative analysis of five cosmological models: $\u039b$CDM, $w$CDM, $w\\_0w\\_a$CDM, $\u03c6$CDM (with scalar-field dark energy), and an interacting dark energy scenario (the $\u03be$ model), to investigate dark energy evolution and the Hubble tension. Utilizing the latest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, BAO), Pantheon+ (Type Ia Supernovae, SNIa), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data (including lensing) from \\textit{Planck} and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), we report three key findings. First, the Hubble constant ($H\\_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w < -1$), while late-universe (BAO/SNIa) data prefer quintessence ($w > -1$). Third, the full dataset suggests a late-time interaction between dark energy and matter.

We show how the escaping CRs accelerate and heat the ISM fluid depending on the CR diffusion coefficient. The CR heating effects are potentially responsible for the recent observations of the unexpected H$\u03b1$ and [OIII]$\u03bb$5007 lines in old supernova remnants. The implied gas outflow by CRs can be comparable to the Galactic star formation rate, compatible with the Galactic wind required for the metal-polluted halo gas and the production of eROSITA bubbles.

Variation with respect to the metric, supplemented by small perturbations, produces the equations of motion and the terms that determine the propagation speed of tensor perturbations. The resulting Hubble parameter incorporates contributions from stiff matter and dark energy, the last originating from a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The viability of the model is assessed by using Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and type Ia supernovae data. Best model selection based on information criteria indicates a slight preference for this new framework over the $\u039b$ Cold Dark Matter model. Stability of the model follows from the positive speed of sound and absence of ``Ostrogradsky ghosts''. The total equation of state parameter hints towards the presence of a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion at $z\\approx 0.66$, corresponding to the transition from matter to dark energy dominance.

Y. Wang et.al., [2512.07140v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07140v1)\n\n Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intense pulses with unknown origins. A subclass of repeating FRBs show some common features, such as associated compact persistent radio sources (PRSs), high burst rates, and large host-galaxy dispersion measures (DMs). Meanwhile, they show diverse DM and rotation measure (RM) variations, which cannot be explained by current models. A unified model urgently needs to be established. Here we show the first evidence for a supernova remnant surrounding the FRB 20190520B source. We then demonstrate that the five active repeating FRB sources associated with PRSs can be understood within a single model in which central objects are young magnetars in massive binary systems embedded in supernova remnants. This model naturally predicts distinct variations of DM and RM for repeating FRBs. Crucially, young magnetar wind nebulae can generate bright PRSs. As a magnetar becomes older, the luminosity of a PRS will fade, which can naturally explain less-luminous PRSs for some active FRBs.

To study trends in frequencies and amplitudes, and possibly spectacular phenomena like resonant amplification, we perform a series of axisymmetric long-duration magnetohydrodynamic CCSN simulations of a 17 $M\\_\\odot$ progenitor using a finely spaced grid in initial rotation rate from 0.29 rad/s to 3.48 rad/s. We find that these rotating models produce GWs at frequencies of up to 3 kHz, higher than in typical non-rotating models in the literature. The high frequencies arise due to small polar radii of rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars and stabilization by angular momentum gradients at lower latitude. GW frequencies and amplitudes tend to decrease with faster rotation. Different from two complementary simulations without magnetic fields, the magnetohydrodynamic models are characterized by an absence of p-modes above the dominant high-frequency emission band. We find no indication of resonant mode amplification for any rotation rate, although a temporo-spatial and space-frequency analysis reveals some interesting couplings of quadrupolar motions across the proto-neutron star and the gain region. We find that linear mode analysis based on the spherically averaged structure becomes unsuitable in this regime of rapid rotation. More advanced perturbative techniques need to be developed to study the mode structure and mode interaction in the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars.\n\n"}}
