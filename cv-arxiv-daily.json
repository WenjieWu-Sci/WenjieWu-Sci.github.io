In this work, we present the first comprehensive analytical study of the marked power spectrum's sensitivity to primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) of the non-local type. We extend previous effective field theory frameworks to incorporate PNG, developing a complete theoretical model that we validate against the Quijote simulation suite. Through a systematic Fisher analysis, we compare the constraining power of the marked power spectrum against traditional approaches combining the power spectrum and bispectrum (P+B). We explore different choices of mark parameters to evaluate their impact on parameter constraints, particularly focusing on equilateral and orthogonal PNG as well as neutrino masses. Our analysis shows that while marking up underdense regions yields optimal constraints in the low shot-noise regime, the marked power spectrum's performance for discrete tracers with BOSS-like number densities does not surpass that of P+B analysis at mildly non-linear scales ($k \\lesssim 0.25 \\,h/\\text{Mpc}$). However, the marked approach offers several practical advantages, including simpler estimation procedures and potentially more manageable systematic effects. Our theoretical framework reveals how the marked power spectrum incorporates higher-order correlation information through terms resembling tree-level bispectra and power spectrum convolutions. This work establishes a robust foundation for applying marked statistics to future large-volume surveys.\n\n", "2411.14355": "2024-11-21, **Measurement of two-neutrino double electron capture half-life of $^{124}$Xe with PandaX-4T**, PandaX Collaboration et.al., [2411.14355v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14355v1)\n\n Detailed studies of two-neutrino double electron capture (2$\\nu$DEC) is a crucial step towards searching for the neutrino-less mode to explore the Majorana nature of neutrinos.

The difference in strength between weak interactions and mass-generating interactions is argued to allow for the production and detection of flavour neutrinos in weak interactions as massless particles. They experience the mass-generating interactions as coherent forward scattering in the Brout-Englert-Higgs vacuum, which induces macroscopically multi-refringent effects. The flavour neutrino wave is then found to have a universal effective refractive mass in vacuum and a unique group velocity for a given energy. The coherence of the wave is manifest throughout and, at every moment of the propagation, the energy of the waves is the same. The standard oscillation probability in vacuum is obtained and the effects of matter are incorporated in a natural way.\n\n", "2411.14234": "2024-11-21, **Steering in Neutrino Oscillations with Non-Standard Interaction**, Lekhashri Konwar et.al., [2411.14234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14234v1)\n\n In this study, we analyze the influence of Non-Standard Interaction (NSI) on steering in three-flavor neutrino oscillations, with a focus on the NO$\\nu$A and DUNE experimental setups.

The purpose of this comparison is to identify the sources of systematic errors (e.g., implementation method of proton-photon interactions) and to quantify the expected dispersion in numerical SED models computed with the five codes. The outputs from the codes are first tested in synchrotron self-Compton scenarios that are the simplest blazar emission models used in the literature. We then compare the injection rates and spectra of secondary particles produced in pure hadronic cases with monoenergetic and power-law protons interacting on black-body and power-law photon fields. We finally compare the photon SEDs and the neutrino spectra for realistic proton-synchrotron and leptohadronic blazar models. We find that the codes are in excellent agreement with respect to the spectral shape of the photons and neutrinos.

We find that the expected impact on $N\\_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{SM}}$ crucially depends on the temperature at which positronium equilibrates as well as the rate at which this equilibration happens. The dominant factor limiting the formation process is the melting of positronium at high temperatures driven by Debye screening of the electrostatic potential and scatterings with real photons.

It has been shown some time ago that this particle can be accessible for direct production in collider experiments. In this paper we point out that the $T$-particle represents a simultaneous low-energy probe of baryon number violation as well as of the origin of the neutrino mass, linking the mediation of proton decay with oscillations of the neutron into a sterile neutrino. We point out a triple correlation between its collider signatures, proton decay measurements and the searches for the magnetic resonance disappearance of free neutrons in cold neutron experiments.

This singlet Majorana fermion also serves as a viable thermal relic dark matter candidate due to its limited interactions with other fields. To construct the model, we adopt an $A\\_4$ flavour symmetry in a modular framework, where the odd modular weight of the fields ensures their stability, and the specific modular weights of the couplings yield distinctive modular forms, leading to various phenomenological consequences.

We use this approach to infer the $\\Omega\\_m$ and $\\sigma\\_8$ cosmological parameters from simulated dark matter and halo fields. Our experiments indicate that the constraints on $\\Omega\\_m$ and $\\sigma\\_8$ obtained using CvT are better than the traditional vision transformer (ViT) and CNN, using either dark matter or halo fields. For CvT, pretraining on dark matter fields proves advantageous for improving constraints using halo fields compared to training a model from the beginning. However, ViT and CNN do not show these benefits. The CvT is more efficient than ViT since, despite having more parameters, it requires a training time similar to that of ViT and has similar inference times.

Through dimensional reduction in KK gravity, the 5D spacetime framework can be reformulated in terms of a 4D spacetime metric, along with additional scalar and vector fields. From the 4D perspective, this suggests the existence of a tower of particle states, including KK gravitons with massive spin-0 and spin-1 states, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity (GR). By assuming a minimal coupling between the self-interacting scalar field and the gauge field, a \"mass\" term emerges for the spin-1 gravitons. This, in turn, leads to long-range gravitational effects that could modify Newton's law of gravity through Yukawa-type corrections. We draw an analogy with superconductivity theory, where the condensation of a scalar field results in the emergence of massive spin-1 particles producing repulsive forces, along with an increase of the gravitational force due the correction to Newton's constant. Assuming an environment-dependent mass for the spin-1 graviton, near the galactic center the repulsive force from this spin-1 graviton is suppressed by an additional attractive component from Newton's constant corrections, resulting in a Newtonian-like, attraction-dominated effect. In the galaxy's outer regions, the repulsive force fades due to its short range, making dark matter appear only as an effective outcome of the dominant attractive corrections. This approach also explains dark matter's emergence as an apparent effects on cosmological scales while our model is equivalent to the scalar-vector-tensor gravity theory. Finally, we examine the impact of dark matter on the primordial gravitational wave (PGW) spectrum and show that it is sensitive to dark matter effects, providing an opportunity to test this theory through future GW observatories.\n\n", "2411.14128": "2024-11-21, **Exploration of new experimental strategies for the detection of ultralight dark matter : laboratory searches on ground and in space**, Jordan Gu\u00e9 et.al., [2411.14128v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14128v1)\n\n Ultralight dark matter (ULDM), as a class of low mass (< 1 eV) dark matter (DM) candidates, is a compelling alternative to historically dominant models such as WIMPs and has recently gained significant attention in the scientific community. In this thesis, we study various experimental schemes for the direct detection of ULDM, both on ground and in space. More precisely, we propose a theoretical modeling of current and futuristic experiments, and we derive an estimation of their respective sensitivity. We mainly concentrate on three distinct phenomenologies. The first one is the coupling between a DM U(1) field, known as the dark photon (DP), and electromagnetism, which induces a small electric field oscillating at the DP Compton frequency. We study how to detect this electric field using atoms inside a cavity and through dish antennas. The second main phenomenology considered in this thesis is the oscillation of rest mass and transition frequencies of atoms and test masses. These oscillations could be produced by the non-universal coupling of standard matter with a scalar ULDM candidate (dilaton or axion-like particle). We study how to detect such couplings in classical tests of the universality of free fall (UFF), atom interferometry and using LISA.

The influence of dark matter on the orbital evolution of the compact binary is incorporated as a correction to the inspiral Newtonian gravitational waveform. We show that the observations from the proposed space-based detector GWSat, sensitive within the deci-Hz frequency band, when combined with that of the third-generation ground-based detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will produce significantly improved error estimates for all parameters.

However, as the third-body mass increases significantly, the ambient dark matter spike becomes much more dense, rendering the effect of dynamical friction non-negligible.

SABRE South uses seven ultra-high purity NaI(Tl) crystals (with a total target mass of either 35 kg or 50 kg), hermetically sealed in copper enclosures that are suspended within a liquid scintillator active veto. High quantum efficiency and low background Hamamatsu R11065 photomultiplier tubes are directly coupled to both ends of the crystal, and enclosed with the crystal in an oxygen free high thermal conductivity copper enclosure. The active veto system consists of 11.6 kL of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) doped with a mixture of fluorophores and contained in a steel vessel, which is instrumented with at least 18 Hamamatsu R5912 photomultipliers. The active veto tags key radiogenic backgrounds intrinsic to the crystals, such as ${^{40}}$K, and is expected to suppress the total background by 27% in the 1-6 keV region of interest.

This work introduces a new class of spherically symmetric, self-gravitational relativistic charged models for FDM haloes, using the Einasto density model. This study enables the dark matter (DM) to appear as the matter ingredient, which constructs the black hole and extends the non-commutative mini black hole stellar solutions. By considering the charged anisotropic energy-momentum tensor with an equation of state (EoS) $p\\_{r}=-\\rho$, we explore various black hole solutions for different values of the Einasto index and mass parameter. Our approach suggests that the central density of the resulting black hole model mimics the usual de Sitter core. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of constructing a charged self-gravitational droplet by replacing the above-mentioned EoS with a non-local one. However, under these circumstances, the radial pressure is observed to be negative. Ultimately, we consider various possibilities of constructing DM black holes, featuring intermediate masses that could evolve into galaxies. Consequently, some of these theoretical models have the potential to replace the usual black hole solutions of the galactic core. Simultaneously, these models are physically beneficial for being comprised of the fundamental matter component of the cosmos.

Since microlenses near the macro-critical curve influence the number of such high-magnification events, the observed occurrence of Icarus-like events is expected to provide a useful constraint on the properties of microlenses. We first study the mass and mass fraction of microlenses consistent with the observed number of events assuming a single microlens component with a monochromatic mass function, finding that stars that contribute to the intracluster light (ICL) are consistent at the 95% confidence level. We then consider the contribution of primordial black holes (PBHs), which are one of the alternatives to the standard cold dark matter, as microlenses in addition to ICL stars. The derived parameter space indicates that a large abundance of PBHs with a mass around $1\\ M\\_{\\odot}$ and a fraction of PBHs to the total dark matter of $f\\_{\\rm PBH} \\gtrsim 0.2$ cannot explain the observed number of Icarus-like events and therefore is excluded.
