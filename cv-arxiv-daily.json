Recent experimental measurements by COHERENT, CONUS+, and ton-scale xenon detectors--including PandaX-4T and XENONnT--underscore the need for a systematic theoretical framework to bridge high-energy physics scenarios with low-energy observational data. In this work, we develop a comprehensive end-to-end effective field theory (EFT) framework for CE$\u03bd$NS, encompassing the complete energy scale hierarchy spanning the ultraviolet (UV) regime down to the nuclear sector. We consider the low-energy EFT (LEFT) operators up to dimension 8, incorporating their QCD renormalization group running effects, and employ the systematic spurion method to achieve the matching between these operators and the chiral Lagrangian. A full power counting analysis is performed, extending to nuclear response functions, which evaluates contributions from LEFT operators up to dimension 8 while accounting for the nucleon number enhancement effect intrinsic to CE$\u03bd$NS. Moreover, we match the relevant LEFT operators for CE$\u03bd$NS onto operators up to dimension 8 within the Standard Model EFT. By also providing their complete tree-level ultraviolet completions, this procedure establishes a consistent top-down theoretical workflow. Leveraging a broad suite of CE$\u03bd$NS experimental data, this framework enables a combined analysis to extract constraints on the scales of EFT operators and neutrino non-standard interaction parameters.\n\n", "2601.19550": "2026-01-27, **Probing Solar Neutrino Deficit via Torsion-Induced Flavor Change in f(T) Gravity**, H.

This offers a probe of modified teleparallel gravity in astrophysical environments. By using the Dirac action in teleparallel geometry, we derive an effective coupling between the torsion vector and neutrino current. In the weak-field limit around a spherical mass, we obtain analytical expressions for torsion-induced phase shifts and effective mass-squared differences. Our results indicate that both vacuum oscillations and the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance in matter are affected by these torsion-based modifications.

We present a way to reconstruct a toponium state at the $t\\bar{t}$ threshold region formed at the Large Hadron Collider using the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction. We have considered the Non-Relativistic QCD based toponium model implemented in MadGraph5\\\\_aMC@NLO. The final states considered consist of two b-jets, two oppositely charged leptons, and missing energy that arises from two neutrinos. The goal of the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction is to make use of rules that can help resolve combinatorics ambiguity in preparing the decay tree for a given physics event. Additionally, missing energy coming from two neutrinos needs to be resolved in order to reconstruct the event. We apply four different methods within the RestFrames package and compare the reconstruction results resulting from each of the methods. Due to this method, one can also access kinematic variables in the rest frames belonging to intermediate particle states, providing additional means to discriminate the SM $\\ttbar$ background from the toponium signal. We propose using two angular variables to enhance sensitivity to the toponium signal. Our preliminary results indicate that the improvement in sensitivity can be as much as 16\\% over the current strategy in the LHC's Run 3 configuration.

Developing a precise optical model for the PMTs is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of detector simulations and refining the energy response model at JUNO. In this study, we established a comprehensive PMT optical model based on prior studies, taking into account the non-uniformity of photon detection efficiency (PDE) across the PMT surface and the variances in PDE as well as reflections among different PMTs. By collecting reflectance data from 669 PMTs and utilizing PDE data from mass testing systems, we estimated the thickness maps of the photocathode (PC) and the anti-reflective coating (ARC) for each PMT. We also determined the collection efficiency (CE) by decomposing PDE with consideration of the optical processes occurring within the PMTs. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of both the PC and ARC, along with the escape factor, were evaluated over a broad wavelength range of 300~nm to 700~nm, covering the entire spectrum of interest for JUNO. Compared to the prediction from a simplified PMT optical model, which assumes uniform PC and ARC across all PMTs of the same type, the further developed PMT optical model yields much more reflectance for HPK PMTs and less for NNVT PMTs, and the change in PDE is at the level of a few percent.

If gravity is a quantum interaction, its long range character leads to the formation of an atom like bound neutrino structure. We compute its mass distribution and find that, within a radius 292 kpc, the total mass is only ten to the minus 29 of the galaxy dark matter, ruling it out as a dark matter candidate. Nevertheless, experimental confirmation of this structure would constitute direct evidence for gravity as a quantum force mediated by gravitons. If gravity instead arises from spacetime curvature, neutrinos interact only via the short range weak force and are therefore effectively collisionless. In this regime, neutrinos behave as free classical particles orbiting the galaxy and experience no Fermi pressure. We show that such a population can be sufficiently compact to reproduce the Milky Way rotation curve, making neutrinos viable dark matter candidates. The extremely small neutrino antineutrino annihilation cross section further implies near equilibrium between neutrinos and antineutrinos, potentially addressing the matter antimatter asymmetry.\n\n", "2601.18888": "2026-01-26, **Constraining axial non-standard interactions of neutrinos with long baseline experiments**, Yasaman Farzan et.al., [2601.18888v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18888v1)\n\n Thanks to a number of neutrino oscillation and Coherent Elastic neutrino Nucleus Scattering (CE$\u03bd$NS) experiments, the vector Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) of neutrinos have been well studied and constrained.

We examine a simple proxy for this effect in the form of a single-wave solution of an axially symmetric fast flavor system. When the angular crossing is shallow and the growth rate of the instability correspondingly small, the flavor wave primarily affects resonant neutrinos that move in phase with it. The evolution of these resonant neutrinos becomes periodic, undergoing cycles of full flavor reversal. They feed power into the unstable wave, and subsequently return to their initial state, draining power back out. This new flavor pendulum captures the dynamics of weak, nearly monochromatic fast flavor instabilities. Since weakly unstable distributions always exhibit a narrow range of unstable wavenumbers, our model likely describes the earliest development of a flavor instability when it first appears. When the instability is not weak, the linear phase of a single-wave excitation does not connect to a regular nonlinear solution, unless the angle distribution consists of only two beams.\n\n", "2601.18781": "2026-01-26, **Another relation among the neutrino mass-squared differences?**, I.

This phase transition was predicted within the framework of QCD and has been studied in accelerator laboratories world-wide since about 40 years.

In chapter 2, the SuSAM* model is improved by redefining the single nucleon hadronic tensor, averaging it over a Fermi distribution instead of using the previous extrapolation from the relativistic Fermi gas. This formulation removes the inconsistency associated with negative contributions in kinematics far from the QE peak. The new definition allows extending the SuSAM* formalism to include MEC, which is the focus of chapter 3. In chapter 3, a scaling analysis of 12C data is performed incorporating MEC explicitly at the single nucleon level, leading to a new phenomenological scaling function. Using this model, the effect of MEC on EM responses is studied and compared with the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) and the relativistic mean field (RMF) models. Chapter 4 presents a detailed analysis of the interference between 1b2b in the RT. It is shown that this interference is always negative within the independent-particle approximation.

The BG equation is solved using the NN potential developed by the Granada group, allowing for the calculation of high-momentum components.

Two of those resolutions are also run with a weaker central magnetic field of $\\mathord{\\approx}10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{G}$ . The shock revival time for all models is largely independent of resolution and initial magnetic field strength, but we find higher explosion energies when the initial magnetism is stronger and at higher resolutions. We find that models with strong magnetic fields have lower neutrino luminosity and energies, due to a proto-neutron star (PNS) that is deformed by the strong magnetic fields. At higher resolutions, magnetic fields are amplified more efficiently in the gain region and in the PNS via the small-scale dynamo. Although the strong magnetic fields do not directly drive the explosion, they have a subsidiary impact on the explosion mechanism and compensate for the reduced neutrino heating. Stronger magnetic energies in the PNS also affect energy and angular momentum redistribution, leading to more extended and vigorous PNS convection zones at higher resolutions.\n\n", "2601.18237": "2026-01-26, **Revisiting $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion in $R$-parity violating SUSY**, Yu-Qi Xiao et.al., [2601.18237v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18237v1)\n\n The $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion process is one of the most powerful ways to test lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) interactions involving charged leptons. The standard model with massive neutrinos predicts an extremely low rate for $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion, making this process an excellent probe for testing LFV arising from new physics. Among many theoretical models that can induce LFV, the Supersymmetric model with R-parity violating interactions is one of the most studied for $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion.

The $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion, $\u03bc\\to e \u03b3$, and $\u03bc\\to eee$ experimental data are compared to give upper limits on the relevant 15 combinations of the trilinear $\u03bb^{\\prime}$ couplings and 6 combinations of the $\u03bb$ couplings, certain of which are underexplored in previous studies.

Conventional coincidence-based trigger logic implicitly assumes continuous sensor availability and therefore suffers systematic efficiency loss when channels become temporarily non-live. This work presents the design of a liveness-aware trigger architecture targeting low-latency FPGA deployment in distributed optical arrays. We introduce a recursive Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) update law implemented as a fully synthesizable pipeline that constructs a continuity-preserving effective observable at each sensor node. Rather than collapsing during non-liveness intervals, the observable decays smoothly while retaining phase and amplitude information relevant for network-level coherence estimation. By explicitly separating continuous measurement construction from discrete trigger decision logic, the proposed architecture enables graceful degradation under partial channel non-liveness. Performance is evaluated using a hybrid validation framework that combines representative event topologies derived from IceCube Open Data with a hardware-accurate signal and noise model spanning a wide dynamic range. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed trigger sustains high event recovery efficiency in regimes of elevated deadtime probability, where conventional coincidence logic degrades substantially. Furthermore, the continuity-preserving observable yields up to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in effective signal-to-noise ratio, enabling robust detection under strong saturation and non-ideal operating conditions.

In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \\textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B\\_{\\rm sh}\\sim\\mathrm{few}$.

This signal encodes pristine information about our Universe, since it is sensitive to the depth of the clusters' gravitational potential wells. In this work, we show how gravitational redshift can be used to test a fundamental physical principle: the weak equivalence principle. This principle stipulates that all matter falls in the same way in a gravitational potential, regardless of its nature. By comparing the amplitude of the gravitational redshift signal with the velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters, we build a novel test of this principle targeted to the unknown dark matter. Our test is sensitive to any additional interaction that would alter the way dark matter falls in gravitational potentials, hence leading to a violation of the equivalence principle.

This effect arises from effective operators that couple dark matter to Standard Model fields. We present different models that can induce these effective operators by integrating out a mediator field. For mediator masses within the reach of collider searches, an alternative way to discover ultralight dark matter is to search for a resonance. Due to being a mediator to dark matter, the mass of the mediator oscillates. The resonance therefore, should not appear as a single isolated peak, but is smeared out once data is averaged over an oscillation cycle or more. Remarkably, the oscillation period and amplitude are in the range of current and future collider searches, even though constraints from atomic clocks probing variations of the fine-structure constant and the electron mass are very strong. We recast existing searches and projections from Belle II, LHCb and SHiP for an `oscillating resonance', and discuss how the periodicity of the signal can be used to reconstruct the peak from mass-binned data. We further show that time-stamped data would allow to unfold the signal via a fast Fourier transform and determine the significance of the signal for different background levels.

By performing lattice simulations, we track the nonequilibrium dynamics throughout the transition, providing a precise description of the Q-ball formation mechanism and the resulting mass spectrum. Collapsing false-vacuum regions first form thermal balls, which subsequently cool via dissipative interactions and stabilize into long-lived Q-balls with nonzero spin. We observe a large population of low-mass Q-balls, as well as rare, massive Q-balls that are several times larger than the analytical prediction. The final Q-ball population exhibits a broad mass spectrum spanning over two orders of magnitude, characterized by an exponential tail of number density at large masses. The simulations suggest that the Q-ball abundance is approximately $50\\%$ higher than predicted by analytical estimates, adjusting the result in the context of Q-balls as dark matter candidates.\n\n", "2601.18873": "2026-01-26, **Thermoskyrmions**, Mikael Chala et.al., [2601.18873v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18873v1)\n\n Skyrmions are stable and topologically non-trivial field configurations that behave like localized particles.

In this paper, focusing on toy models that capture different limits of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (SM), we show that skyrmions not classically stable at zero temperature can be stabilized by thermal effects.

Using N-body simulations, we follow the tidal stripping and orbital evolution of satellite galaxies as they are accreted into a live cluster halo, systematically varying satellite-to-host mass ratio and orbital circularity. We measure the specific orbital energy and angular momentum of stripped stellar and DM material, finding that the stripped stars consistently occupy lower-energy and lower-angular momentum regions of phase-space than the stripped DM. The magnitude of this difference increases strongly towards more equal satellite--to--host mass ratios, while the dependence on orbital circularity is weak. We construct a predictive model for the phase-space properties of stripped stars and DM from a whole infalling satellite population and find that the resulting phase-space difference between the components are driven primarily by the characteristic mass of the infalling satellite stellar mass function. We find that the ICL is always more centrally concentrated than the DM. The magnitude of this offset depends on the characteristic mass and increases towards higher characteristic masses. Comparisons with four independent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that, once the infalling satellite stellar mass function is matched, the model reproduces the radial stellar-to-DM density profile offsets to better than the inter-simulation scatter. This demonstrates that the radial relationship between the ICL and the DM distribution is largely governed by satellite demographics. With adequate constraints on the infalling satellite population, ICL density profiles can therefore be used as informative tracers of the underlying radial DM distribution in clusters.\n\n", "2601.18652": "2026-01-26, **Impact of Rastall gravity on hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters**, M.

The hydrostatic mass and the mass obtained from gravitational lensing measurements generally differ, a discrepancy known as the hydrostatic mass bias. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within the framework of Rastall gravity and investigate its implications under two scenarios: (i) the absence of dark matter and (ii) the existence of dark matter. In the first scenario, Rastall gravity effectively reduces the hydrostatic mass, bringing it closer to the observed baryonic mass. The best linear fit yields a slope $\\mathbf{M}=1.07\\pm0.11$, indicating a near one-to-one correspondence between the two masses. In the second scenario, Rastall gravity helps to alleviate the hydrostatic mass bias. The linear fit between the Rastall hydrostatic mass and the observed lensing mass results in a best-fit slope $\\mathbf{M}=1.01\\pm0.16$, which is very close to unity. These results suggest that Rastall gravity provides a statistically favorable framework for addressing mass discrepancies in galaxy clusters.\n\n", "2601.18578": "2026-01-26, **The AIDA-TNG project: gas distributions inside and around haloes**, Chi Zhang et.al., [2601.18578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18578v1)\n\n The nature of Dark Matter (DM) is one of the most outstanding mysteries of modern astrophysics. While the standard Cold DM (CDM) model successfully explains observations on most astrophysical scales, DM particles have not yet been detected, leaving room for a plethora of different models. In order to identify their observable signatures, we use the AIDA-TNG cosmological simulation suite to predict the distributions of gas and neutral hydrogen (HI) in the CDM, Self-Interacting DM (SIDM), velocity-dependent SIDM (vSIDM), and Warm DM (WDM) models.   We find that the DM models investigated have very limited impact on the median gas and HI profile of haloes. In particular, for the most massive haloes ($M\\_{\\rm vir}\\sim10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{M}\\_\\odot$), we find that DM self-interactions can shallow the central potential and thereby enhance gas cooling. We find that, in all models, the halo-to-halo variation in the HI profiles is explained by AGN feedback, and that the specific characteristics of DM model is largely subdominant. Nevertheless, we detect some systematic difference in the case of SIDM, with more HI surviving close to the centre with respect to other models. We provide fitting functions for the gas and HI profiles.   We investigate the galaxy-Ly$\u03b1$ cross-correlation function (\\galacc) for different halo masses, redshift and observation strategies.

Finally, by comparison the results of the rotating Cardoso black hole with that of Kerr black hole in the absence of dark matter, we find that the presence of dark matter can not significantly affect the disk properties and thus for astrophysical black holes with large spin parameter, the distinction of rotating Cardoso black holes becomes more difficult than the Kerr black hole.\n\n", "2601.18079": "2026-01-26, **Vanishing Compactness Gap and Fermionic Compact Dark Matter in Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz Gravity**, Edwin J.

It is therefore crucial for unbiased cosmology inference that host galaxy properties be self-consistently determined across the full range of redshifts probed, which we undertake in this study for approximately 2000 SNe in the Union3 compilation (now Union3.1). We use aperture-matched, homogeneously-reduced, optical-infrared photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys to derive global galaxy properties using the stellar population synthesis and SED-fitting code Prospector. We find that the host masses of $z<0.10$ SNe in Union3 were, on average, overestimated relative to the rest of the sample, while the opposite was true for $z<0.15$ SNe in Pantheon+. After correction, the two studies' average distance modulus estimated for low-redshift SNe, previously $>0.03$ mag discrepant, come into 0.01 mag agreement.

Understanding how, in the absence of Coulomb collisions, energy is redistributed between the different plasma species remains a fundamental open question. We use 3D fully-kinetic simulations to investigate energy partition in weakly magnetized counter-propagating plasmas. Our results reveal a complex interplay between different processes, where at early times the Weibel instability drives a first stage of magnetic field amplification and at late times the kinking of current filaments drives a second amplification stage via a dynamo-type mechanism. Electrons are heated primarily during the latter phase through magnetic pumping. By the time the flows thermalize, we observe that the final temperature ratio $T\\_e/T\\_i$ and energy partition depend on the ion-to-electron mass ratio.

For such old stellar systems the initial mass function (IMF) at the high mass regime can never be observed directly, because stars more massive than about 1 Mo have evolved since longtime. However, the hydrostatic to explosive alpha-element ratio (HEx ratio) offers a way to bypass the lack of observable high mass stars through the yields that massive stars released when exploding as supernovae, incorporated in the stars we presently observe in GCs. The HEx ratio measures the percentage of high mass stars over the total number of stars exploding as supernovae and it is an efficient probe of the ephemeral first phases of the GC evolution. We exploited a recently completed survey to assemble a dataset of very homogeneous abundances of alpha-elements in 27 GCs from [Fe/H]~ -2.4 to ~ -0.3 dex. In agreement with previous results from APOGEE, we confirm that the HEx ratio is indistinguishable for GCs formed in situ and accreted in the Galaxy, and that this ratio decreases with increasing metallicity. However, we posit that this trend is better explained by a metallicity-dependent IMF deficient in the highest mass stars at high metallicity, as corroborated by the declining [O/Mg] ratio as a function of the [Mg/H] ratio. At odds with the previous analysis based on APOGEE data, we detect an anti-correlation of HEx ratio with both present day and initial GC masses. Finally, we hypothesise that in that analysis, the stars of the GC M 54 were probably confused with stars in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, where the cluster is presently immersed.\n\n", "2601.18542": "2026-01-26, **XFit: Global Optimization and Degeneracy Mapping in X-ray Spectral Modeling**, Austin MacMaster et.al., [2601.18542v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18542v1)\n\n The standard approach to modeling X-ray spectral data relies on local optimization methods, such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. While effective for simple models and speedy spectral fitting, these local optimizers are prone to becoming trapped in local minima, particularly in high-dimensional or degenerate parameter spaces, and typically require extensive user intervention. In this work, we introduce XFit, a global optimization method for fitting X-ray data, which makes extensive use of the Ferret evolutionary algorithm. XFit enables automated exploration of complex parameter spaces, efficient mapping of confidence intervals, and identification of degenerate solutions that may be overlooked by local methods. We demonstrate the performance of XFit using two representative X-ray sources: the Central Compact Object in Cassiopeia A and the supernova remnant G41.1-0.3. These examples span both low- and high-dimensional models, allowing us to illustrate the advantages of global optimization. In both cases, XFit produces solutions that are consistent with or improve upon those found with traditional methods, while also revealing alternative fits or degenerate solutions within statistically acceptable confidence levels. The automated mapping of parameter space offered by XFit makes it a powerful complement to existing spectral fitting tools, particularly as models and data quality become increasingly complex. Future work will expand the application of XFit to broader datasets and more physically motivated models.\n\n"}}
