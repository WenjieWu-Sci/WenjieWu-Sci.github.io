Some of the generalizations such as generalized CW and next-to-nearest neighbour interaction CW have already been explored by a few authors. In this study, we studied non-local CW for the fermionic case and found that non-local models relax the $\\left\\| q \\right\\| > 1$ constraint to produce localization of the zero mode. We also made a comparison among them and have shown that for some parameter ranges, non-local variants of CW are more efficient than ordinary CW in generating the hierarchy required for the $\\nu$ mass scale. Finally, phenomenological constraints from $BR(\\mu \\rightarrow e \\gamma )$ FCNC process and Higgs decay width have been imposed on the parameter space in non-local and both-sided clockwork models. We have listed benchmark points which are surviving current experimental bounds from MEG and are within the reach of the upcoming MEG-II experiment.\n\n", "2407.13727": "2024-07-18, **Cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis**, Beatriz Hern\u00e1ndez-Molinero et.al., [2407.13727v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13727v1)\n\n We use the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations to compute cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background C$\\_{\\nu}$B with other observables, namely: cold dark matter density, effective weak lensing convergence, neutrino velocity and neutrino deflection angle. We provide, for the first time, this high-fidelity cross-correlation maps in order to illustrate how much can be learned from them once the cosmic neutrino background is measured.

Working in a renormalisable extension of the Standard Model by three right-handed neutrinos, we address the question of how much information about the fundamental model parameters can be obtained by measuring the branching ratios in the decays of the heavy neutral leptons into individual SM generations. We find that, provided that these branching ratios could be measured with arbitrary precision, they would be sufficient to pin down all 18 parameters of the model when supplemented with light neutrino oscillation data. When considering a finite statistical uncertainty comparable to that which can be achieved by future lepton colliders in the mass range of tens of GeV, some parameter degeneracies remain, but measurements would still provide powerful consistency checks of the model. In the sub-GeV range similar sensitivities can be expected for SHiP and DUNE. This shows the potential of these experiments to not only discover heavy neutral leptons, but play an important role in understanding their role in particle physics and cosmology.\n\n", "2407.13595": "2024-07-18, **Small Neutrino Masses from a Decoupled Singlet Scalar Field**, Jongkuk Kim et.al., [2407.13595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13595v1)\n\n We propose a unified solution with $Z\\_4$ discrete symmetry for small neutrino masses and stability of dark matter.

Once the $Z\\_4$ symmetry is broken to $Z\\_2$ by the VEV of $\\varphi$, much below the mass scale of the singlet scalar $S$, a small quartic coupling between SM Higgs and inert doublets, which violates both $Z\\_4$ and lepton number, is generated at tree level, so small neutrino masses are obtained at one-loops.

S. Bhupal Dev et.al., [2407.12738v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12738v1)\n\n Neutrinophilic mediators are well-motivated messenger particles that can probe some of the least known sectors of fundamental physics involving nonstandard interactions of neutrinos with themselves and potentially with dark matter. In particular, light mediators coupling to the active neutrinos will induce new decay modes of the Standard Model mesons (e.g., $\\pi^\\pm, K^\\pm \\to \\ell^\\pm + \\nu + \\phi$), charged leptons (e.g., $\\tau^\\pm \\to \\pi^\\pm + \\nu + \\phi$), and gauge bosons (e.g., $Z \\to \\nu + \\bar{\\nu} + \\phi$). A common lore is that these decays suffer from infrared divergences in the limit of the vanishing mediator mass, i.e., $m\\_\\phi \\to 0$. Here, we show for the first time that including the 1-loop contributions of these mediators to the standard 2-body decays (e.g., $\\pi^\\pm,\\,K^\\pm \\to \\ell^\\pm + \\nu$, etc.), the infrared divergence from the 3-body decay cancels out exactly by virtue of the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem. Including these cancellation effects, we then update the existing laboratory constraints on neutrinophilic scalar mediators, thereby extending the limits far beyond the decaying parent particle mass and excluding a wider range of parameter space.

These new high-resolution simulations allowed us to revisit fitting formulas proposed in the literature and provided updated fitting parameters that extend to less massive haloes and lower neutrino masses than previously in the literature, in accordance with new cosmological limits. The trend we observe for low neutrino masses is that, for dark matter halo masses below $\\sim 4\\times10^{14}$$h^{-1}M\\_\\odot$, the presence of the core becomes weaker and the profile over the whole radius is closer to a simple power law. We also characterized the neutrino density profile dependence on the solid angle within clustered structures: a forward-backward asymmetry larger than 10% was found when comparing the density profiles from neutrinos along the direction of motion of cold dark matter particles within the same halo. In addition, we looked for neutrino wakes around halo centres produced by the peculiar motion of the halo itself. Our results suggest that the wakes effect is observable in haloes with masses greater than $3\\times10^{14}$ $h^{-1}M\\_\\odot$ where a mean displacement of $0.06$\\hmpc was found.\n\n", "2407.12573": "2024-07-17, **Neutrino beaming in ultraluminous X-ray pulsars as a result of gravitational lensing by neutron stars**, Alexander A. Mushtukov et.al., [2407.12573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12573v1)\n\n X-ray pulsars experiencing extreme mass accretion rates can produce neutrino emission in the MeV energy band. Neutrinos in these systems are emitted in close proximity to the stellar surface and subsequently undergo gravitational bending in the space curved by a neutron star. This process results in the formation of a distinct beam pattern of neutrino emission and gives rise to the phenomenon of neutrino pulsars. The energy flux of neutrinos, when averaged over the neutron star's pulsation period, can differ from the isotropic neutrino energy flux, which impacts the detectability of bright pulsars in neutrinos. We investigate the process of neutrino beam pattern formation, accounting for neutron star transparency to neutrinos and gravitational bending. Based on simulated neutrino beam patterns, we estimate the potential difference between the actual and apparent neutrino luminosity. We show that the apparent luminosity can greatly exceed the actual luminosity, albeit only in a small fraction of cases, depending on the specific equation of state and the mass of the star. For example, the amplification can exceed a factor of ten for $\\approx0.2\\%$ of typical neutron stars with mass of $1.4\\,M\\_\\odot$. Strong amplification is less probable for neutron stars of higher mass. In the case of strange stars, a fraction of high energy neutrinos can be absorbed and the beam pattern, as well as the amplification of apparent neutrino luminosity, depend on neutrino energy.\n\n", "2407.12544": "2024-07-17, **Two-field inflation from one complex scalar with symmetry breaking**, Yoshihiko Abe et.al., [2407.12544v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12544v1)\n\n We study two-field inflation derived from a single complex scalar with a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Inflation is characterized by two parameters, the vacuum expectation value and the mass parameter of the phase mode, which give rise to a variety of inflationary structures. We categorize the potential trajectories of the two inflaton fields and determine the parameter regions consistent with current observational data. Furthermore, we examine the reheating process through the inflaton decay to right-handed neutrinos and the subsequent lepton number generation within these parameter regions. Our finding suggests that the existence of multiple fields can significantly alter the possibilities for inflaton oscillations and reheating.\n\n", "2407.12493": "2024-07-17, **Bulk viscosity of 2SC quark matter in neutron star mergers**, Mark Alford et.al., [2407.12493v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12493v1)\n\n We study the bulk viscosity of moderately hot and dense, neutrino-transparent color superconducting quark matter arising from weak-interaction-driven direct Urca processes. The quark matter is modeled using Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model improved to account for vector and t'Hooft interactions as well as antisymmetric pairing among the red/green up and down quarks. The unpaired excitations are the strange quarks and the blue up or down quarks. We compute the relaxation rates associated with $d$ and $s$-quark decay and electron capture processes on $u$ quark for blue color. The resulting bulk viscosity for density oscillations in the 1 to 10\\,kHz range shows a resonant peak at $T\\sim 5\\,\\MeV$, and the damping time may drop below 10 ms.

These fields lead to non-metricity. In this article, we will discuss the significance of these fields in inflation and dark energy. We will construct a Lagrangian formalism to include these scalar fields in a theory of gravity coupled with ordinary matter and radiation. We will find that these fields need not to be included in the actions of interacting gauge theories coupled with conserved fermionic vector currents as a part of the connection. The same remains valid for ordinary scalar fields. We can couple the connection-scalars with ordinary matter by adding suitable interaction terms. In this context, we will find that Stokes' theorem leads us to include the right-handed neutrinos in the electroweak theory in curved spacetime even with the Levi-Civita connection. This is required to obtain consistent equations of motion and anomaly-free conserved vector current for the neutrinos. Axial vector currents for different Dirac fields may remain anomalous. The right-handed neutrinos can be useful to explain neutrino oscillation and dark matter. We will also discuss the possibility of introducing massless finite integer spin particles using second rank symmetric traceless tensors with reference to the corresponding little group in flat spacetime. We will show that we can use massless (A,A) type fields in Minkowski space to introduce massless finite integer spin particles.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2407.13754": "2024-07-18, **On the consistency of rotation curves and spatially integrated HI flux profiles**, Tariq Yasin et.al., [2407.13754v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13754v1)\n\n Resolved rotation curves (RCs) are the gold-standard measurements for inferring dark matter distributions in $\\Lambda$CDM and testing alternative theories of dynamics in galaxies. However they are expensive to obtain, making them prohibitive for large galaxy samples and at higher redshift. Spatially integrated HI flux profiles are more accessible and present the information in a different form, but -- except in a highly compressed form, as linewidths -- have not so far been compared in detail with RCs or employed for dynamical inferences. Here we study the consistency of RCs and HI surface density profiles from SPARC with spatially integrated HI flux profiles from ALFALFA, by combining the resolved properties in a forward model for the flux profile. We define a new metric for asymmetry in the flux profiles, enabling us to cleanly identify those unsuitable for our axisymmetric method. Among all SPARC galaxies the agreement between RCs and flux profiles is satisfactory within the limitations of the data -- with most galaxies having an uncertainty normalised mean squared error (MSE) below 10 -- while no galaxy deemed symmetric has a MSE above 1.2. Most cases of good agreement prefer a HI gas dispersion $\\sigma\\_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ of ~13 km/s, consistent with resolved studies of gas dispersion from the literature. These results open the door for spatially integrated HI flux profiles to be used as proxies for spatially resolved dynamics, including a robust appraisal of the degree of asymmetry.\n\n", "2407.13735": "2024-07-18, **Predicting dark matter halo masses from simulated galaxy images and environments**, Austin J.

However, it is not known whether other observable galaxy features, such as their morphologies or large-scale environments, can be used to tighten the correlation between galaxy properties and halo masses. In this work, we train a baseline random forest model to predict halo mass using galaxy features from the Illustris TNG50 hydrodynamical simulation, and compare with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) trained respectively using galaxy image cutouts and galaxy point clouds. The best baseline model has a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.310 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.220, compared to the CNN (RSME=0.359, MAE=0.238), GNN (RMSE=0.248, MAE=0.158), and a novel combined CNN+GNN (RMSE=0.248, MAE=0.144). The CNN is likely limited by our small data set, and we anticipate that the CNN and CNN+GNN would benefit from training on larger cosmological simulations.

Theoretically, axions can convert into photons in the presence of a strong external magnetic field, which means it is possible to search for them experimentally. One approach is to use radio telescopes with high-resolution spectrometers to look for axion-photon conversion in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. In this paper, we describe the results obtained using a novel approach where we used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients produced by collisions between neutron stars and dark matter clumps known as axion miniclusters.

Smith et.al., [2407.12985v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12985v1)\n\n Lacking the ability to follow individual galaxies on cosmological timescales, our understanding of individual galaxy evolution is broadly inferred from population trends and behaviours. In its most prohibitive form, this approach assumes that galactic star formation properties exhibit ergodicity, so that individual galaxy evolution can be statistically inferred via ensemble behaviours. The validity of this assumption is tested through the use of observationally motivated simulations of isolated galaxies. The suite of simulated galaxies is statistically constructed to match observed galaxy properties by using kernel density estimation to create structural parameter distributions, augmented by theoretical relationships where necessary. We also test the impact of different physical processes, such as stellar winds or the presence of halo substructure on the star formation behaviour. We consider the subtleties involved in constraining ergodic properties, such as the distinction between stationarity imposed by stellar wind feedback and truly ergodic behaviour. However, without sufficient variability in star formation properties, individual galaxies are unable to explore the full parameter space. While, as expected, full ergodicity appears to be ruled out, we find reasonable evidence for partial ergodicity, where averaging over mass-selected subsets of galaxies more broadly resembles time averages, where the average largest deviation across physical scenarios is 0.20 dex. As far as we are aware, this the first time partial ergodicity has been considered in an astronomical context, and provides a promising statistical concept.

These models capture the angular variation with spherical harmonics for the halo and azimuthal harmonics for the disk, and the radial or meridional plane variation with splines. We fit low-order expansions (4 angular/harmonic terms) to the galaxy's potential for each snapshot, spaced roughly 25 Myr apart, over the last 4 Gyr of its evolution, then extract the forces at discrete times and interpolate them between adjacent snapshots for forward orbit integration. Our method reconstructs the forces felt by simulation particles with high fidelity, with 95% of both stars and dark matter, outside of self-gravitating subhalos, exhibiting errors $\\leq4\\%$ in both the disk and the halo. Imposing symmetry on the model systematically increases these errors, particularly for disk particles, which show greater sensitivity to imposed symmetries. The majority of orbits recovered using the models exhibit positional errors $\\leq10\\%$ for 2-3 orbital periods, with higher errors for orbits that spend more time near the galactic center. Approximate integrals of motion are retrieved with high accuracy even with a larger potential sampling interval of 200 Myr. After 4 Gyr of integration, 43% and 70% of orbits have total energy and angular momentum errors within 10%, respectively. Consequently, there is higher reliability in orbital shape parameters such as pericenters and apocenters, with errors $\\sim10\\%$ even after multiple orbital periods.

The axion potential is flattened at the origin, corresponding to the only minimum, while it is unsuppressed at $\\pi$. These potential features arise by assuming a mirror sector with the strong CP phase $\\bar\\theta$ shifted by $\\pi$ compared to the SM sector, which allows the mirror axion potential to be tuned against the usual QCD axion potential. Before the QCD phase transition, assuming the mirror sector is decoupled and much colder than the SM thermal bath, the mirror sector potential dominates, causing the axion to initially roll to a temporary minimum at $\\pi$. However, after the QCD phase transition, the potential minimum changes, and the axion relaxes from the newly created \"hilltop\" near $\\pi$ to the CP-conserving minimum at the origin. As the axion adiabatically tracks this shift in the potential minimum through the QCD phase transition, with non-adiabatic evolution near $\\pi$ and 0, it alters the usual prediction of the dark matter abundance. Consequently, this \"hilltop\" misalignment mechanism opens new regions of axion parameter space, with the correct relic abundance while still solving the strong CP problem, that could be explored in future experiments.\n\n", "2407.12913": "2024-07-17, **Generalised hydrogen interactions with $\\texttt{CINCO}$: a window to new physics**, Martin Bauer et.al., [2407.12913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12913v1)\n\n We present semi-analytic solutions for atomic transition rates in hydrogenic atoms induced by scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor interactions.

We carry out an extended analysis of the density profiles and mass distributions of two detected subhaloes, intending to determine if their properties are consistent with the predictions of the cold dark matter (CDM) model. We analyse two gravitational lensing systems in which the presence of two low-mass subhaloes has been previously reported: SDSSJ0946+1006 and JVASB1938+66. We model these detections assuming four different models for their density profiles and compare our results with predictions from the IllustrisTNG50-1 simulation. We find that the detected subhaloes are well-modelled by steep inner density slopes, close to or steeper than isothermal. The NFW profile thus needs extremely high concentrations to reproduce the observed properties, which are outliers of the CDM predictions. We also find a characteristic radius within which the best-fitting density profiles predict the same enclosed mass. We conclude that the lens modelling can constrain this quantity more robustly than the inner slope. We find that the diversity of subhalo profiles in TNG50, consistent with tidally stripping and baryonic effects, is able to match the observed steep inner slopes, somewhat alleviating the tension reported by previous works even if the detections are not well fit by the typical subhalo. However, while we find simulated analogues of the detection in B1938+666, the stellar content required by simulations to explain the central density of the detection in J0946+1006 is in tension with the upper limit in luminosity estimated from the observations.

We model the galaxy as a two-component system consisting of stars and gas in equilibrium with an external dark matter halo. We derive the equations governing the growth of perturbations and obtain a stability criterion that connects the potential of the dark matter halo and the gas fraction with the stability levels of the galaxy. We find that a two-component disc is more susceptible to the growth of gravitational instabilities than individual components, particularly as gas fractions increase. However, the external field, due to the dark matter halo, acts as a stabilizing agent and increases the net stability levels even in the presence of a cold gas component. We apply the stability criterion to models of the Milky Way, low surface brightness galaxies, and baryon-dominated cold rotating disc galaxies observed in the early universe. Our results show that the potential due to the dark matter halo plays a significant role in stabilizing nearby galaxies, such as the Milky Way, and low surface brightness galaxies, which would otherwise be prone to local gravitational instabilities.

The combined magnitude of these kicks is still a topic of debate, and has implications for the eventual location of the transient resulting from the merger of the binary. For example, the offsets of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) resulting from BNS mergers depend on the BNS kicks. We investigated Galactic BNSs, and traced their motion through the Galaxy. This enabled us to estimate their kinematic ages and construct a BNS kick distribution, based on their Galactic trajectories. We used the pulsar periods and their derivatives to estimate the characteristic spin-down ages of the binaries. Moreover, we used a Monte Carlo estimation of their present-day velocity vector in order to trace back their trajectory and estimate their kinematic ages. These trajectories, in turn, were used to determine the eccentricity of their Galactic orbit. Based on simulations of kicked objects in the Galactic potential, we investigated the relationship between this eccentricity and kick velocity, in order to constrain the kicks imparted to the binaries at birth. We find that the Galactic BNSs are likely older than $\\sim40$ Myr, which means their current (scalar) galactocentric speeds are not representative of their initial kicks. However, we find a close relationship between the eccentricity of a Galactic trajectory and the experienced kick. Using this relation, we constrained the kicks of the Galactic BNSs, depending on the kind of isotropy assumed in estimating their velocity vectors. These kick velocities are well-described by a log-normal distribution peaking around $\\sim40-50$ km/s, and coincide with the peculiar velocities of the binaries at their last disc crossing.\n\n", "2407.13207": "2024-07-18, **SN 2021wvw: A core-collapse supernova at the sub-luminous, slower, and shorter end of Type IIPs**, Rishabh Singh Teja et.al., [2407.13207v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13207v1)\n\n We present detailed multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of a rare core-collapse supernova SN 2021wvw, that includes photometric evolution up to 250 d and spectroscopic coverage up to 100 d post-explosion. A unique event that does not fit well within the general trends observed for Type II-P supernovae, SN 2021wvw shows an intermediate luminosity with a short plateau phase of just about 75 d, followed by a very sharp (~10 d) transition to the tail phase. Even in the velocity space, it lies at a lower velocity compared to a larger Type II sample. The observed peak absolute magnitude is -16.1 mag in r-band, and the nickel mass is well constrained to 0.020(6) Msol. Detailed hydrodynamical modeling using MESA+STELLA suggests a radially compact, low-metallicity, high-mass Red Supergiant progenitor (ZAMS mass=18 Msol), which exploded with ~0.2e51 erg/s leaving an ejecta mass of Mej~5 Msol. Significant late-time fallback during the shock propagation phase is also seen in progenitor+explosion models consistent with the light curve properties. As the faintest short-plateau supernova characterized to date, this event adds to the growing diversity of transitional events between the canonical ~100 d plateau Type IIP and stripped-envelope events.\n\n", "2407.13087": "2024-07-18, **Forecasting Supernova Observations with the CSST: I. Photometric Samples**, Chengqi Liu et.al., [2407.13087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13087v1)\n\n The China Space Station Telescope (CSST, also known as Xuntian) is a serviceable two-meter-aperture wide-field telescope operating in the same orbit as the China Space Station. The CSST plans to survey a sky area of 17,500 deg$^2$ of the medium-to-high Galactic latitude to a depth of 25-26 AB mag in at least 6 photometric bands over 255-1000 nm. Within such a large sky area, slitless spectra will also be taken over the same wavelength range as the imaging survey. Even though the CSST survey is not dedicated to time-domain studies, it would still detect a large number of transients, such as supernovae (SNe). In this paper, we simulate photometric SN observations based on a strawman survey plan using the Sncosmo package. During its 10-year survey, the CSST is expected to observe about 5 million SNe of various types. With quality cuts, we obtain a \"gold\" sample that comprises roughly 7,400 SNe Ia, 2,200 SNe Ibc, and 6,500 SNe II candidates with correctly classified percentages reaching 91%, 63%, and 93% (formally defined as classification precision), respectively. The same survey can also trigger alerts for the detection of about 15,500 SNe Ia (precision 61%) and 2,100 SNe II (precision 49%) candidates at least two days before the light maxima. Moreover, the near-ultraviolet observations of the CSST will be able to catch hundreds of shock-cooling events serendipitously every year. These results demonstrate that the CSST can make a potentially significant contribution to SN studies.\n\n", "2407.12554": "2024-07-17, **Shock cooling emission from explosions of massive stars: III.

Here, we extend our work to provide similar analytic formulae for explosions of blue supergiants with radiative polytropic envelopes. The analytic formulae are calibrated against a large set of spherically symmetric multi-group (frequency-dependent) calculations for a wide range of progenitor parameters (mass, radius, core/envelope mass ratios) and explosion energies. In these calculations we use the opacity tables we constructed (and made publicly available), that include the contributions of bound-bound and bound-free transitions.

Although SLSNe were simply defined by their peak luminosity at first, it is currently recognized that they show rich spectroscopic diversities including hydrogen-poor (Type I) and hydrogen-rich (Type II) subtypes. The exact mechanisms making SLSNe luminous are still not fully understood, but there are mainly four major suggested luminosity sources (radioactive decay of 56Ni, circumstellar interaction, magnetar spin-down, and fallback accretion). We provide an overview of observational properties of SLSNe and major theoretical models for them. Future transient surveys are expected to discover SLSNe at high redshifts which will provide a critical information in revealing their nature.\n\n", "2407.12284": "2024-07-17, **Blue supergiants as a progenitor of intermediate-luminosity red transients**, Takashi J. Moriya et.al., [2407.12284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12284v1)\n\n The current perspective about the explosions of blue supergiants is that they resemble SN 1987A. These so-called peculiar Type II supernovae, however, are one of the rarest types of supernovae and may not hence be the fate of all blue supergiants. In this work, we explore other explosion scenarios for blue supergiants. We create synthetic light curves from the explosions of blue supergiant models born from binary mergers, over a range of explosion energies and 56Ni masses. We find that blue supergiant explosions may also lead to intermediate-luminosity red transients. We thus identify two categories of supernovae possible from blue supergiant explosions: those with high 56Ni masses (> ~ 0.01 Msun) result in slow-rising, dome-shaped light curves like SN 1987A. Lower 56Ni masses result in low-luminosity, short-plateau light curves resembling some intermediate-luminosity red transients and Type II supernovae like SN 2008bp, which are possible from the explosions of compact blue supergiants and not from the far more extended red supergiants. Our results indicate that blue supergiant explosions are more diverse than SN 1987A-like events and may be hidden among different kinds of transients, explaining the possible discrepancies between the expected fraction of blue supergiants born from binary mergers and the observed fraction of SN 1987A-like supernovae.\n\n", "2407.12250": "2024-07-17, **Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with Type Ia supernova and transverse BAO measurements**, Min Wang et.al., [2407.12250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12250v1)\n\n In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the angular diameter distance (ADD) derived from the transverse Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data with the luminosity distance (LD) from the Pantheon type Ia supernova (SNIa) sample. The binning method and Gaussian process are employed to match ADD data with LD data at the same redshift. First, we use nonparametric and parametric methods to investigate the impact of the specific prior values of the absolute magnitude $M\\_{\\rm B}$ from SNIa observations and the sound horizon scale $r\\_{\\rm s}$ from transverse BAO measurements on the CDDR tests. The results obtained from the parametric and non-parametric methods indicate that specific prior values of $M\\_{\\rm B}$ and $r\\_{\\rm s}$ lead to significant biases on the CDDR test. Then, to avoid these biases, we propose a method independent of $M\\_{\\rm B}$ and $r\\_{\\rm s}$ to test CDDR by considering the fiducial value of $\\kappa\\equiv10^{M\\_{\\rm B} \\over 5}r\\_{\\rm s}$ as a nuisance parameter and then marginalizing its influence with a flat prior in the analysis. No violation of the CDDR is found, and the transverse BAO measurement can be used as a powerful tool to verify the validity of CDDR in the cosmological-model-independent method.\n\n"}}
