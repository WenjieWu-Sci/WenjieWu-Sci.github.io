Novel results relating blazars to high-energy neutrinos, cosmic rays, and even possible manifestations of new particle physics, are often based on statistical analyses of blazar samples, and uniform sky coverage is important for many of these studies.   $\\it{Aims.}$ Here, we construct a uniform full-sky catalog of blazars selected by their optical emission.   $\\it{Methods.}$ We define criteria of isotropy, making a special effort to cover the Galactic plane region, and compile an isotropic sample of blazars with GAIA optical magnitudes $G<18^{\\rm m}$, corrected for the Galactic absorption. The sources are taken from full-sky samples selected by parsec-scale radio emission or by high-energy gamma-ray flux, both being known to efficiently select blazar-like objects.   $\\it{Results.}$ We present a catalog of 651 optically bright blazars, uniformly distributed in the sky, together with their radio, optical, X-ray and gamma-ray fluxes, and an isotropic sample of 336 confirmed BL Lac type objects.   $\\it{Conclusions.}$ This catalog may be used in future statistical studies of energetic neutrinos, cosmic rays and gamma rays.\n\n", "2312.07188": "2023-12-12, **Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Mass within Consistent Cosmological Models**, Ye-Huang Pang et.al., [2312.07188v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07188v1)\n\n Recently, the emergence of cosmological tension has raised doubts about the consistency of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. In order to constrain the neutrino mass within a consistent cosmological framework, we investigate three massive neutrinos with normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) in both the axion-like EDE (Axi-EDE) model and the AdS-EDE model.

We find that the three angles defining the generalized CP symmetries have narrow allowed ranges. We also obtain distinct correlations between the three mixing angles and the CP-violating phases that distinguish the various texture patterns from one another.

R. Arguelles et.al., [2312.07461v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07461v1)\n\n Non-linear structure formation for fermionic dark matter particles leads to dark matter density profiles with a degenerate compact core surrounded by a diluted halo. For a given fermion mass, the core has a critical mass that collapses into a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Galactic dynamics constraints suggest a $\\sim 100$ keV/$c^2$ fermion, which leads to $\\sim 10^7 M\\_\\odot$ critical core mass. Here, we show that baryonic (ordinary) matter accretion drives an initially stable dark matter core to SMBH formation and determine the accreted mass threshold that induces it. Baryonic gas density $\\rho\\_b$ and velocity $v\\_b$ inferred from cosmological hydro-simulations and observations produce sub-Eddington accretion rates triggering the baryon-induced collapse in less than a Gyr. This process produces active galactic nuclei in galaxy mergers and the high-redshift Universe.

This dynamical process makes computing the correct chemical evolution, e.g., metallicity gradients, of galaxies very difficult. This dynamical process makes inferring the chemical evolution of observed galaxies from their measured abundance gradients very difficult. One way to account for radial migration is to infer stellar birth radii for individual stars. Many attempts to do so have been performed over the last years, but are limited to the Milky Way as computing the birth position of stars requires precise measurements of stellar metallicity and age for individual stars that cover large Galactic radii. Fortunately, recent and future surveys will provide numerous opportunities for inferring birth radii for external galaxies such as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In this paper, we investigate the possibility of doing so using the NIHAO cosmological zoom-in simulations. We find that it is theoretically possible to infer birth radii with a ~ 25% median uncertainty for individual stars in galaxies with i) orderliness of the orbits, $\\langle v\\_\\phi \\rangle/\\sigma\\_{v} >$ 2, ii) a dark matter halo mass greater or equal to approximately the LMC mass (~ 2 x 10$^{11} M\\_\\odot$), and iii) after the average azimuthal velocity of the stellar disk reaches ~70% of its maximum.

In the framework of the wave Dark Matter model, we have carried out a Jeans Analysis on eight dwarf spheroidal galaxies that are orbiting around the Milky Way, and we have constrained the boson mass. Differently to a previous analysis, we adopted an anisotropy parameter that varies with the distance from the centre of the galaxy to assess whether this assumption would help to resolve, or at least alleviate, the well-known tension with the value of the boson mass favoured by the cosmological analysis. Our results indicate that, differently to what happens in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, such a tension cannot be lifted introducing a variable anisotropy parameter, leaving as a possible solution the existence of additional axion or axion-like particles with higher masses as naturally predicted in the Axiverse.\n\n", "2312.07173": "2023-12-12, **Dynamical analysis of coupled curvature-matter scenario in viable $f(R)$ dark energy models at de-sitter phase**, Anirban Chatterjee et.al., [2312.07173v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07173v1)\n\n We explore the interaction between dark matter and curvature-driven dark energy within viable $f(R)$ gravity models, employing the phase-space analysis approach of linear stability theory.

Then, we test this solution in the axial gravitational perturbation and calculated their gravitational ringings of this black hole, that is the quasinormal mode (QNM). Where, when the geometric parameter $a>2M$, a series of gravitational wave echoes appear after the QNM, and the distinctive feature of the gravitational wave echoes is the double barrier feature. Besides, we also study the impacts of the shape parameters of the Einasto profile both on the QNM and gravitational wave echoes of this black hole, and extract their frequencies using the WKB method and Prony method. In particular, from the perspective that the QNM frequencies between different black hole parameters are distinguishable, we give an upper limit for the shape parameters of the Einasto profile, which is approximately $\\alpha<0.20$.

The strongest constraint on the BD coupling constant is provided by the Shapiro time delay measurement in the solar system by Cassini. Constraints from gravitational wave (GW) events are subject to asymmetric binaries (binaries with different ``sensitivity'' such as neutron star-black hole (NSBH), white dwarf-neutron star, or white dwarf-black hole binary). The third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) reports an NSBH merger event, GW200115, making it possible to constrain BD by GW. With the aid of this source and Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses, we derive the 90\\% credible lower bound on the modified parameter of BD as $\\omega\\_{\\rm BD}>4.75$ by using dominant (2, 2) mode correction.

Various plausible scenarios such as acceleration at the wind termination shock (WTS), supernova shocks inside these young star clusters, etc. have been proposed,since it is difficult to accelerate particles up to the $10^7\\hbox{--}10^9$ GeV range in the standard paradigm of CR acceleration in supernova remnants.

Using the maximum energy estimate from the Hillas criterion, we argue that a young massive star cluster can accelerate protons up to a few tens of PeV.

PSR J1638-4713 was identified using Parkes radio telescope observations at frequencies above 3 GHz.

The PWN has a cometary morphology and one of the greatest projected lengths among all the observed pulsar radio tails, measuring over 21 pc for an assumed distance of 10 kpc. The remarkably long tail and atypically steep radio spectral index are attributed to the interplay of a supernova reverse shock and the PWN. The originating supernova remnant is not known so far.
