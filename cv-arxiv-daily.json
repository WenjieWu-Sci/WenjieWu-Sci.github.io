In this work, we perform the first global fit of elastic neutrino-nucleus and neutrino-electron scattering data to further test the SM within a consistent framework. Our results on the neutrino charge radius, the only non-zero electromagnetic property of neutrinos in the SM, show no significant deviation, indicating no large beyond the SM flavor-dependent effects for electron and muon neutrinos. By incorporating solar neutrino data from dark matter direct detection experiments, we also place the most stringent constraints on the tau neutrino charge radius obtained from neutrino scattering experiments. Additionally, we determine updated constraints on the vector and axial-vector neutrino-electron neutral current couplings, adjusting for flavor-dependent effects and for the different experimental momentum transfers. The global analysis reveals two allowed solutions: one close to the SM prediction, and a degenerate solution that is favored. We show that future dark matter detectors could achieve sufficient precision to resolve the degeneracy. As we move toward the precision era, this work demonstrates the crucial need to properly account for flavor- and momentum-dependent effects to avoid misinterpretations of the data.\n\n", "2504.05057": "2025-04-07, **Experimental Constraints on Seesaw Parameters in the Wigner-like Parametrization**, Jihong Huang et.al., [2504.05057v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05057v1)\n\n By introducing three right-handed neutrino singlets, the popular canonical seesaw mechanism is able to simultaneously explain the tiny masses of Majorana neutrinos and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this paper, we provide an explicit calculation in this model with the help of the Wigner-like parametrization, working in the flavor basis that both the Dirac and Majorana mass matrices are chosen to be diagonal. Physical observables can be exactly calculated without any approximation, where three light Majorana neutrino masses $m\\_i^{}$, leptonic mixing angles $\\theta\\_{ij}^{}$, CP-violating phases $\\{\\delta,\\rho,\\sigma\\}$, and three rotation angles $\\vartheta\\_i^{}$ describing the hierarchy between electroweak and seesaw scales are chosen as input parameters. For demonstration, we evaluate the branching fractions of the lepton-flavor-violating decays of charged leptons and the CP-violating asymmetries in the resonant thermal leptogenesis. The model parameters are constrained by the latest experimental limits.\n\n", "2504.04913": "2025-04-07, **The GRINTA hard X-ray mission: an Explorer of the Transient Sky**, James Rodi et.al., [2504.04913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04913v1)\n\n The era of time domain multi-messenger (MM) astrophysics requires sensitive, large field-of-view (FoV) observatories that are able to quickly react in order to respond to alerts from gravitational wave (GW) triggers, neutrino detections, and transient sources from all parts of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. This is particularly true at hard X-rays and soft gamma-rays where the EM counterparts to GW triggers, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), emit most of their flux. While the present decade has a number of instruments capable of accomplishing this task, there are no missions planned for the 2030's when improved MM facilities will detect many more events. It is in this context that we present the GRINTA mission concept. GRINTA has a large area, large FoV detector to search for short, impulsive events in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range and a coded mask telescope for localizing and performing follow-up observations of sources from 5-200 keV. While GRINTA's main scientific goal is studying MM events, the instruments will observe numerous other sources to explore the sky at hard X-rays/soft gamma-rays.\n\n", "2504.04741": "2025-04-07, **The First Search for Optical Transient as a Counterpart of a Month-timescale IceCube Neutrino Multiplet Event**, Seiji Toshikage et.al., [2504.04741v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04741v1)\n\n Optical transients with timescale of months, such as supernovae (SNe) and tidal disruption events (TDEs), are candidates of high-energy neutrino sources. Multiple neutrino detections from the same direction within a month timescale provide a unique opportunity to identify such optical counterparts in the nearby Universe. In this work, we conduct archival search for the optical counterpart of an IceCube triplet event using the data of Zwicky Transient Facility. We develop a dedicated alert filtering system and validate the performance by following a blind analysis method. Applying this filtering system to the data after the detections of the IceCube triplet event, we find no transient candidates within the localization area. Assuming that the IceCube triplet event originates from an astrophysical source, we constrain parameters of optical transient, a peak luminosity and a decay timescale, using a simple signal model that is motivated by TDEs and superluminous SNe (SLSNe). Assuming the case with no time lag between neutrino detections and optical peak, almost entire parameter space of the known TDEs and SLSNe would be constrained. To give constraints on transients with a rapidly evolving light curve, quick follow-up observations for future neutrino multiplet events are crucial.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2504.05236": "2025-04-07, **Gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo**, Mirzabek Alloqulov et.al., [2504.05236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05236v1)\n\n In this paper, we study the periodic orbits, characterized by zoom-whirl behavior, around a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) embedded within a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo. We demonstrate how the DM halo modifies the gravitational dynamics of the black hole, influencing the energy and angular momentum of timelike particle geodesics and enhancing their interaction with the BH. We determine the radii of the marginally bound orbits (MBOs) and innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs), showing that the DM halo increases both. This provides a deeper understanding of how the DM alters the behavior, energy, and angular momentum of timelike particle geodesics. Furthermore, we explore the gravitational waveforms emitted by a timelike particle in periodic orbits around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) within this BH-DM system. Using a semi-analytical approach, we calculate particle trajectories and derive the corresponding waveforms, demonstrating that the DM halo modifies the zoom-whirl orbital behavior, leading to distinct changes in the waveform structure. Our findings suggest that future gravitational wave (GW) observations could constrain the properties of DM halos surrounding BHs, providing new insights into the gravitational wave signatures arising from the interaction between BH gravity and DM.\n\n", "2504.05215": "2025-04-07, **Quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section of a Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter in four dimensions**, Angel Rincon et.al., [2504.05215v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05215v1)\n\n In this paper we study quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections for the $(1+3)$-dimensional Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. Studies of the massless scalar field is already done in \\cite{Sun:2023slzl}. Hence, in this paper we will focus on the massive scalar field perturbations and massless Dirac field perturbations. To compute the quasinormal modes we use the semi-analytical 3rd-order WKB method, which has been shown to be one of the best approaches when the effective potential is adequate and when $n < \\ell$ and $n < \\lambda$. We have also utilized the P\\\"oschl-Teller method to compare the valus obtained using the WKB approach. We have computed quasinormal frequencies by varying various parameters of the theory such as the mass of the scalar field $\\mu$, dark matter parameter $\\alpha$ and the magnetic charge $g$. We have summarized our solutions in tables and figures for clarity. As for the absorption cross section, we used third order WKB approach to compute reflection, transmission coefficients and partial absorption cross sections.

We show why it is unlikely these ``hostless'' supernovae stem from escaped hyper-velocity stars (HVS) in any appreciable numbers, especially for core-collapse supernovae. It is highly likely that hostless events arise from dwarf host galaxies too faint to be detected in their parent surveys. Several detections and numerous upper limits suggest a large number of field dwarfs, to $M\\_V>-14$, which themselves may be important to constraining the slope of the low-mass end of the UV luminosity function, understanding galaxy evolution, and putting $\\Lambda$CDM into context. Moreover, the detailed study of these mass and metallicity-constrained host environments, and the variety of supernovae that occur within them, could provide more stringent constraints on the nature of progenitor systems.\n\n", "2504.04917": "2025-04-07, **Modeling the circumstellar interaction around SN 2004gq**, A. P. Nagy et.al., [2504.04917v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04917v1)\n\n The relationship between the mass-loss history and final evolutionary stage of massive stars and the properties of the observable supernova (SN) is still under debate. This is especially true for stripped-envelope (Type Ib/c) SNe, where the progenitor ejects a considerably large amount of material during its evolution, which can lead to a circumstellar medium relatively close to the exploding star. Moreover, when the star explodes as a SN, this matter may contribute significantly to the generated luminosity because of the interaction. However, the trace of this circumstellar interaction can only be investigated for a couple of Type Ib/c SNe, and the nature of a close (within around $10^{15}$ cm) circumstellar matter (CSM) has also been largely unexplored for these objects.   Here, we present the results of our radio and bolometric light curve (LC) analysis related to SN 2004gq. We describe a combined model that explains the unusual LC properties of this event and supports the circumstellar interaction scenario. For that, we computed the quasi-bolometric LC of the SN and fit this with a multicomponent model to gain information on the progenitor and the surrounding circumstellar medium. We also analyzed the available radio LCs (taken at 1.4,\\ 4.9 and 8.5 GHz) of SN 2004gq to verify our estimated average mass-loss rate, which is one of the most crucial physical properties related to CSM models.   We infer reasonable parameters for SN 2004gq using radioactive decay and magnetar energy input. To power the entire LC, we must also add an extra energy source related to the CSM. We determine the most essential parameter of this medium: the average mass-loss rate from both LC and radio data fitting. We find that the suggested hidden circumstellar interaction is a viable mechanism that provides the required energy deficiency and that it can be estimated using a simple semi-analytic model.\n\n", "2504.04825": "2025-04-07, **Binary neutron star merger offsets from their host galaxies II. Short-duration gamma-ray bursts**, N. Gaspari et.al., [2504.04825v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04825v1)\n\n The mergers of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and neutron star-black holes (NSBHs) binaries have long been linked to short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). However, despite their stellar progenitors, SGRBs are often found outside the stellar light of the host galaxy. This is commonly attributed to supernova kicks, which displace the SGRB progenitors from the original stellar population. Our goal is to use stellar population synthesis models to reproduce and interpret the observed offsets of a statistical sample of SGRBs, using realistic galactic models based on the observed host properties. We derive the host galaxy potentials from the observed properties on a case-by-case basis, and simulate the galactic trajectories of synthetic BNSs and NSBHs from the BPASS code using three different kick prescriptions. We compare predicted and observed offsets to investigate the impact of velocity kicks, host galaxy types, and host association criteria. The results confirm that the locations of the SGRB population are consistent with the expectations of kicked BNS or BHNS progenitors, implying that such mergers are the dominant (if not only) progenitor system. Predictions for NSBHs provide a significantly worse fit compared to BNSs, while we find no significant difference when comparing different kick prescriptions. For late-type hosts, we find the best agreement when including hosts with a probability of chance alignment Pch up to 20%, while lower Pch thresholds lead us to overestimate SGRB offsets. We argue that Pch is biased against viable hosts at the largest offsets, and suggest the use of less conservative Pch thresholds for late-type hosts. For early-type hosts, the predictions underestimate SGRB offsets in a few cases regardless of the Pch threshold applied. We argue that this is likely due to the models missing galaxy evolution, or spurious host associations.\n\n"}}
