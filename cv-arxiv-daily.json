We present comprehensive analysis on implications and constraints of the primordial neutrino asymmetry $\\xi\\_\\nu$, based on a precise treatment of neutrino decoupling by solving the complete (anti)neutrino quantum kinetic equations in the Closed-Time-Path formalism. The effective number of neutrinos $ N\\_{\\rm eff}$ and (anti)neutrino spectral distortions are calculated, and we find that the non-instantaneous decoupling correction is given by $\\delta N\\_{\\rm eff} = 0.0440 + 0.0102 \\, \\xi\\_\\nu^2$. Then we perform the state-of-the-art calculation for the abundance of light elements including (anti)neutrino spectral distortions, which indicate a positive asymmetry $0.032 \\leq \\xi\\_\\nu \\leq 0.052$ from EMPRESS data. The implications of the neutrino asymmetry for the CMB and LSS are studied in detail, and we find that the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) are also significantly affected by $\\xi\\_\\nu$ in addition to the sum of neutrino masses. A combined analysis with EMPRESS BBN, Planck CMB and BOSS BAO data yields a tighter constraint $\\xi\\_\\nu = 0.024 \\pm 0.013$, which provides constraints on UV models capable of producing large asymmetries.\n\n", "2409.08178": "2024-09-12, **Insights from Binary Pulsars and Laboratories into Baryon Number Violation: Implications for GeV Dark Matter**, Rouzbeh Allahverdi et.al., [2409.08178v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08178v1)\n\n Rare processes in laboratory and within astrophysical environments can be highly sensitive probes of baryon-number violating interactions at the TeV scale. We demonstrate the power of neutron stars to constrain baryon number violation by considering a minimal extension of the standard model involving a TeV-mass scalar mediator and a GeV scale Majorana fermion $\\psi$. We find that a $\\Delta B = 2$ mass-loss process in binary pulsar systems via $n \\to \\gamma \\psi$ and the subsequent scattering $\\psi n \\to \\pi^- K^+$ places stringent constraints on the model parameter space. These limits will become much stronger, due to the possibility of $\\Lambda \\rightarrow \\gamma \\psi$ decays at the tree level, if the neutron star equation of state is hyperonic. We compare these constraints with ongoing and future collider experiments, $n-\\bar{n}$ oscillations, and dinucleon decay searches at future large-scale neutrino experiments, finding that the binary pulsars bounds on couplings are significantly tighter for specific flavor combinations.\n\n", "2409.07768": "2024-09-12, **Enhancing Direct Detection of Higgsino Dark Matter**, Peter W.

The Higgsino can naturally realize the ``inelastic dark matter\" scenario, where the scattering off a nucleus occurs between two nearly-degenerate states, making it invisible to WIMP direct detection experiments if the splitting is too large to be excited. It was realized that a ``luminous dark matter\" detection process, where the Higgsino upscatters in the Earth and subsequently decays into a photon in a large neutrino detector, offers the best sensitivity to such a scenario. We consider the possibility of adding a large volume of a heavy element, such as Pb or U, around the detector. We also consider the presence of U and Th in the Earth itself, and the effect of an enhanced high-velocity tail of the dark matter distribution due to the presence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. These effects can significantly improve the sensitivity of detectors such as JUNO, SNO+, and Borexino, potentially making it possible in the future to cover much of the remaining parameter space for this classic SUSY WIMP dark matter.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2409.08129": "2024-09-12, **Can millicharge be probed at future Super Tau Charm Facility via mono-$\u03c0^0$ searches?**, Yu Zhang et.al., [2409.08129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08129v1)\n\n We propose a new channel to search for millicharged particles at the future Super Tau Charm Facility (STCF) via mono-$\\pi^0$ signature. For the first time, we compute the mono-$\\pi^0$ signal events at the future STCF due to millicharged particle production, as well as due to standard model irreducible/reducible backgrounds. By utilizing the assumed 20 ab$^{-1}$ luminosity for each running energy with $\\sqrt{s}= 2$ GeV, 4 GeV and 7 GeV, we derive the corresponding upper limits on millicharge, respectively. Via mono-$\\pi^0$ searches at the future STCF with $\\sqrt{s}=2$ GeV, the upper limits on millicharge can be improved than ArgoNeuT when the mass of millicharged particle is less than about 500 MeV, but are not very competitive compared to a latest derivation from a past BEBC experiment and a new SENSEI experiment.

This scenario is challenged by the memory burden effect, which suggests that the evaporation of black holes may slow down significantly after they have emitted about half of their initial mass. We explore the astrophysical implications of the memory burden effect on the PBH abundance by today and the possibility for PBHs lighter than $\\sim10^{-18}M\\_{\\odot}$ to persist as dark matter. Our analysis utilizes current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data to constrain the primordial power spectrum and infers the PBH abundance. We find a null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves that accompanied the formation of the PBHs. Then we place an upper limit on the primordial power spectrum and the PBH abundance to be $f\\_{\\mathrm{pbh}}\\simeq0.3$ for PBHs with masses $\\sim10^{-24}M\\_{\\odot}$. Furthermore, we expect that next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer, will provide even more stringent constraints.

Lyskova et.al., [2409.07856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07856v1)\n\n Massive clusters of galaxies are very rare in the observable Universe. Even rarer are mergers of such clusters observed close to pericenter passage. Here, we report on one such case: a massive (~ $10^{15}\\,M\\_\\odot$) and hot (kT ~ 10 keV) cluster CL0238.3+2005 at $z\\approx 0.42$. For this cluster, we combine X-ray data from SRG/eROSITA and Chandra, optical images from DESI, and spectroscopy from BTA and RTT-150 telescopes. The X-ray and optical morphologies suggest an ongoing merger with the projected separation of subhalos of $\\sim 200$ kpc. The line-of-sight velocity of galaxies tentatively associated with the two merging halos differs by 2000-3000 km/s. We conclude that, most plausibly, the merger axis is neither close to the line of sight nor to the sky plane. We compare CL0238 with two well-known clusters MACS0416 and Bullet, and conclude that CL0238 corresponds to an intermediate phase between the pre-merging MACS0416 cluster and the post-merger Bullet cluster. Namely, this cluster has recently (only $\\lesssim 0.1$ Gyr ago) experienced an almost head-on merger. We argue that this \"just after\" system is a very rare case and an excellent target for lensing, Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and X-ray studies that can constrain properties ranging from dynamics of mergers to self-interacting dark matter, and plasma effects in intracluster medium that are associated with shock waves, e.g., electron-ion equilibration efficiency and relativistic particle acceleration.\n\n", "2409.07851": "2024-09-12, **Multi-component dark matter and Galactic 511 keV $\u03b3$-ray emission**, Sarif Khan et.al., [2409.07851v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07851v1)\n\n We study multi-component dark matter scenarios and the Galactic 511 keV $\\gamma$-ray emission line signal in the framework of a local, dark $U(1)\\_D$ extension of the Standard Model. A light vector dark matter particle associated with the dark $U(1)\\_D$ may decay and annihilate to electron-positron pairs. The produced positrons may in turn form positroniums that subsequently annihilate to two photons, accounting for the observed line signal of the Galactic 511 keV $\\gamma$-ray emission. Three scenarios are investigated. First, we consider the minimal $U(1)\\_D$ extension where a dark gauge boson and a dark Higgs boson are newly introduced to the particle content. As a second scenario, we consider WIMP-type dark matter with the introduction of an extra dark fermion which, in addition to the dark gauge boson, may contribute to the dark matter relic abundance. It is thus a multi-component dark matter scenario with a UV-complete dark $U(1)\\_D$ symmetry. In particular, the vector dark matter may account for a small fraction of the total dark matter relic abundance. Finally, we consider the scenario where the dark matter particles are of the FIMP-type. In this case, both the light vector and fermion dark matter particles may be produced via the freeze-in and super-WIMP mechanisms. Considering theoretical and observational constraints, we explore the allowed parameter space where the Galactic 511 keV $\\gamma$-ray line signal and the dark matter relic can both be explained.

The model and its approximations were developed using the hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs in environments of low-density bubbles and clumpy media with different densities and volume-filling factors. For calculation of SNR luminosities we developed the synchrotron emission model, implying the test-particle approximation. The goal of this work is to explain the flattened part of $\\Sigma-D$ relation for Galactic SNRs at $D\\approx14-50$ pc. Our model shows that the shock collision with the clumpy medium initially enhances the brightness of individual SNRs, which is followed by a steeper fall of their $\\Sigma-D$ curve. We used the analytical model to generate large SNR samples on $\\Sigma-D$ plane, within a span of different densities and distances to clumpy medium, keeping the observed distribution of diameters. After comparison with the Galactic sample, we conclude that the observed $\\Sigma-D$ flattening and scatter originates in sporadic emission jumps of individual SNRs while colliding with the dense clumps. Statistically, the significant impact of the clumps starts at diameters of $\\approx14$ pc, up to $\\sim70$ pc, with the average density jump at clumpy medium of $\\sim2-20$ times, roughly depending on the low density of circumstellar region.

The algorithm utilizes ``integral packets'', which are calculated by the path integral of the Monte-Carlo energy packets, to synthesize the observed spectropolarimetric signal at a given viewing direction in a 3-D time-dependent radiative transfer program. Compared to the event-based technique (EBT) proposed by (Bulla et al. 2015), our algorithm significantly reduces the computation time and increases the Monte-Carlo signal-to-noise ratio. Using a 1-D spherical symmetric type Ia supernova (SN Ia) ejecta model DDC10 and its derived 3-D model, the IBT algorithm has successfully passed the verification of: (1) spherical symmetry; (2) mirror symmetry; (3) cross comparison on a 3-D SN model with direct-counting technique (DCT) and EBT. Notably, with our algorithm implemented in the 3-D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code SEDONA, the computation time is faster than EBT by a factor of $10-30$, and the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is better by a factor of $5-10$, with the same number of Monte-Carlo quanta.\n\n"}}
