Grohs et.al., [2303.06576v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06576v1)\n\n The mechanism for generating neutrino masses remains a puzzle in particle physics. If neutrino masses follow from a Dirac mass term, then neutrino states exist with opposite chirality compared to their weakly-interacting counterparts. These inactive states do not interact with their active counterparts at measurable scales in the standard model. However, the existence of these states can have implications for cosmology as they contribute to the radiation energy density at early times, and the matter energy density at late times. How Dirac neutrinos may populate thermal states via an anomalous magnetic moment operator is the focus of this work. A class of models where all neutrinos have a magnetic moment independent of flavor or chirality is considered. Subsequently, the cross sections for neutrinos scattering on background plasma particles are calculated so that the relic inactive neutrino energy is derived as a function of plasma temperature. To do so, one needs cross sections for scattering on all electrically charged standard-model particles. Therefore, the scattering cross section between a neutrino and $W$-boson via the magnetic moment vertex is derived. Current measurements put a constraint on the size of the neutrino magnetic moment from the cosmological parameter $N\\_{\\rm eff}$ and light-element primordial abundances.

The strong absorption trough found in the 21-cm global spectrum measured by the EDGES experiment, which has a much greater depth than the standard model prediction, has drawn great interest to this scenario, but more generally it is still of great interest to consider such a cosmic radio background (CRB) in the early Universe. To be effective in affecting the 21-cm signal at early time, such a radio background must be produced by sources which can emit strong radio signals but modest amount of X-rays, so that the gas is not heated up too early. We investigate the scenario that such a radio background is produced by the primordial black holes (PBHs). For PBH with a single mass, we find that if the PBHs' abundance $\\log(f\\_{\\rm PBH})$ (ratio of total PBH mass density to total matter density) and mass satisfy the relation $\\log(f\\_{\\rm PBH}) \\sim -1.8\\log(M\\_\\bullet/{\\rm M}\\_{\\odot})-3.5$ for $1\\,{\\rm M}\\_\\odot \\lesssim M\\_\\bullet \\lesssim 300 {\\rm M}\\_\\odot$, and have jet emission, they can generate a CRB required for reproducing the 21-cm absorption signal seen by the EDGES. The accretion rate can be boosted if the PBHs are surrounded by dark matter halos, which permits lower $f\\_{\\rm PBH}$ value to satisfy the EDGES observation. In the latter scenario, since the accretion rate can evolve rapidly during the Cosmic Dawn, the frequency (redshift) and depth of the absorption trough can determine the mass and abundance of the PBHs simultaneously.

In this era of precision cosmology, the community strives to find new ways to reduce uncertainties on cosmological parameters. To this end, we start our investigation even from the likelihood assumption of Gaussianity, implicitly used in this domain. Indeed, the usual practise involves constraining parameters through a Gaussian distance moduli likelihood. This method relies on the implicit assumption that the difference between the distance moduli measured and the ones expected from the cosmological model is Gaussianly distributed. In this work, we test this hypothesis for both the \\textit{Pantheon} and \\textit{Pantheon +} releases.

We discuss three possible scenarios: a neutron star merger, a collapsing massive star, and an atypical explosion possibly hosted in a cluster of galaxies.
