Adopting this formalism in this work, we propose a Type-III seesaw model as a unified framework to explain lepton masses and mixing and baryogenesis via leptogenesis. $\\chi^2$ analysis is performed to fit the neutrino oscillation data from NuFIT~6.0 leading to a normal hierarchical pattern of neutrino masses and constrained $CP$ phases. Furthermore, we analyze the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via thermal leptogenesis where the decays of the lightest fermion triplet $\\Sigma\\_1$ into lepton-Higgs final states produce a $CP$ asymmetry $\\varepsilon\\_{CP}$. The complex modules $\\tau$ is responsible for the $CP$ asymmetry produced during leptogenesis.

Within the standard three-flavour framework, we show that the combination of the transition probabilities determined at the DUNE and T2HK experiments can establish the presence of an $L$-odd component, and therefore provide sensitivity to T violation, up to $4\\sigma$ significance. The optimal neutrino energy window is from 0.68 to 0.92 GeV, and therefore a crucial role is played by the low-energy part of the DUNE event spectrum covering the second oscillation maximum. We compare the sensitivity to T violation based on this energy range using neutrino data only with the more traditional search for charge-parity (CP) violation based on the comparison of neutrino versus anti-neutrino beam data. We show that for DUNE it is advantageous to run in neutrino mode only, i.e., searching for T violating effects, whereas T2HK is more sensitive to CP violation, comparing neutrino and anti-neutrino data. Hence, the two experiments offer complementary methods to determine the complex phase in the PMNS mixing matrix.\n\n", "2508.04274": "2025-08-06, **A neutrino data analysis of extra-dimensional theories with massive bulk fields**, Philipp Eller et.al., [2508.04274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04274v1)\n\n We present a global neutrino oscillation analysis of models with a single large extra dimension in which right-handed neutrinos possess bulk Dirac masses.

We perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with strong magnetic fields of approximately 10^17 Gauss. The stellar matter is modeled using equations of state (EoS) derived from relativistic mean-field theory, employing density-dependent couplings calibrated by the DDME2 parameterization. We analyze how the gravitational mass, equatorial radius, shape deformation, magnetic flux, and the magnetic-to-binding energy ratio evolve in response to changes in internal composition, thermodynamic conditions, and magnetic field configuration. Our results show that as PNSs evolve, increasing entropy per baryon and decreasing lepton fractions lead to higher core temperatures. These thermodynamic changes enhance the star's susceptibility to magnetic field-induced deformation, facilitate greater magnetic flux confinement, and increase the magnetic-to-binding energy ratio, especially during the deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases. The PNS's core temperature also determines the efficiency of magnetic field decay.

We consider a general class of models featuring a new dark gauge sector communicating with the Standard Model (SM) through a Higgs portal and a vector-like fermionic portal. We also study the scenario where the dark sector interacts with the SM only via gravity. In all cases, we scan the full parameter space and analyse GW production, highlighting that secluded dark sectors, with excessive dark radiation, fail to produce a LISA-observable GW background. Notably, the fermionic portal yields distinctive GW signals at LISA with peak frequencies of 1-10 mHz, reaching up to 1 Hz for future interferometers like BBO and DECIGO, while the Higgs portal scenario remains limited to around 1 mHz. Both frameworks account for the observed dark matter abundance and predict detectable LISA signals for dark vector bosons near 3-4 TeV (Higgs portal) and 10 TeV (fermionic portal), with a $\\sim$10 GeV dark Higgs.

In this work, we study the detectability of a multi-axion-like model, dubbed the $\\pi$-axiverse, that is distinguishable from the string axiverse. The dark matter candidates are $N^2-1$ pseudo-Nambu-Goto modes (pion- and kaon-like states) stemming from spontaneous breaking of a global $SU(N)$ flavor symmetry.

We explore the parametric resonance of photons interacting with such a dark sector. Axions are well known to form macroscopic solitonic-like objects (axion stars), which experience instabilities due to overdensities stemming from mergers or accretion processes. The instabilities produce high-intensity bursts of radiation via parametric resonance that may be detected at observatories such as MeerKAT, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), and the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). Using numerical methods, we systematically explore the multi-dimensional parameter space of the $\\pi$-axiverse to search for regions where such signals are detectable, which generically differ from single axion models. We identify regions of the parameter space where MeerKAT, SKA, and ngVLA can resolve such signals, assessing the potential of transient searches to constrain the model.

A key observable is the reflex motion of the MW disc with respect to the halo induced by the LMC's infall, which imprints a velocity dipole on kinematics of halo stars. Here we investigate how the dipole varies with Galactocentric radius, and study the sensitivity of the reflex motion signal to different DM outer-halo profiles. Using a suite of basis function expansion (BFE) simulations with truncated NFW profiles ($\\rho \\propto r^{-\\beta}$ beyond $r=50$ kpc), our $N$-body models show that (i) The reflex motion amplitude varies with Galactocentric radius but is largely insensitive to the outer DM slope, implying that the MW-LMC mass ratio alone does not set the dipole strength. (ii) In contrast, the direction of the disc motion is very sensitive to the density distribution of the outer DM halo. (iii) The contraction of the MW halo induced by the LMC's gravitational pull also depends strongly on the outer DM halo profile. (iv) We find a halo instability whose oscillation frequency increases with $\\beta$ producing a potentially observable signature - a sinusoidal pattern of the mean radial velocity of halo stars. Finally, using BFE coefficients we find that steeper truncations produce smaller dipole distortions, while amplifying the quadrupole distortion.

This guiding function and the kernel of the effective metric, as well, are considered to be functions of the expansion scalar of the aether flow.

To assess observational implications, we perform Bayesian analyses using data from the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31), which offer complementary characteristics: MW provides precise velocity profiles across multiple scales, while M31 includes broader morphological constraints. We examine four scenarios: Yukawa gravity without dark matter, dark matter with non-trivial coupling, fully modified gravity, and standard Newtonian gravity. Results show that MW models with $\\lambda < 1$ kpc yield high Bayes factors but risk overfitting, as dark matter mimics baryonic kinematics, while M31's photometric priors from conjugate observations mitigate this, yielding robust parameter estimates. However, in M31, Bayes factors favor Newtonian gravity, suggesting that current data lack the precision to resolve more complex models.

In rare cases the SN ejecta interact with circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected from the progenitor system prior to the SN. The unknown distance between the CSM and SN explosion site makes it impossible to predict when the interaction will start. If the time between the SN and start of CSM interaction is of the order of months to years the SN has generally faded and is not actively followed up anymore, making it even more difficult to detect the interaction while it happens. Here we report on a real-time monitoring program which ran between 13-11-2023 and 09-07-2024, monitoring 6914 SNe Ia for signs of late-time rebrightening using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).

Using data from both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Type Ia Supernova Progenitor Survey, we show that substantial biases (5-15 km/s) exist in radial velocity measurements made from observations at low spectral resolution relative to similar measurements from high-resolution spectra. Our results indicate that the physics of line formation in high-density plasmas, especially in the wings of the lines, are not fully accounted for in state-of-the-art white dwarf model atmospheres. We provide corrections to account for these resolution-induced redshifts in a way that is independent of an assumed mass-radius relation, and we demonstrate that statistical measurements of gravitational redshift with these corrections yield improved agreement with theoretical mass-radius relations. Our results provide a set of best practices for white dwarf radial velocity measurements from low-resolution spectroscopy, including those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope, and the Wide-Field Multiplexed Spectroscopic Facility.\n\n", "2508.04497": "2025-08-06, **Dance to Demise -- How Massive Stars May Form Dense Circumstellar Shells Before Explosion**, Sutirtha Sengupta et.al., [2508.04497v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04497v1)\n\n We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between 12-20 Msun focusing on effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss rates from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including prescriptions for both pulsation-driven superwinds and shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the radiation-driven acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss ~10^-4-10^-2 Msun/yr in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM (>~10^-15 g/cm^3 at distances <~10^15 cm) - consistent with multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN 2023ixf, SN 2020ywx, SN 2017hcc, SN 2005ip and SN 1998S. The formation of such dense CS shells, as predicted by our single star RSG models, provides a natural explanation for observed flash-ionization signatures, X-ray and radio emission, and has important implications for dust formation around Type II SNe.\n\n", "2508.04487": "2025-08-06, **Spectral Energy Correlations of Gamma-Ray Bursts from Structured Jets**, X. L. Zhang et.al., [2508.04487v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04487v1)\n\n Using 148 out-axis gamma-ray bursts, we build their spectrum-energy relations of peak energy versus isotropic energy, peak energy versus peak luminosity and peak energy versus jet-calibrated energy which are corrected for a structured jet model. These relations are found to depend on the observer's viewing angle as long as the observer is within the jet cone. After converting the out-axis energy relations to the in-axis situations, we find that the corresponding in-axis energy relations are universally steeper, of which all of them can be roughly interpreted by the Synchrotron radiation mechanism as shown in Xu et al.. Meanwhile, we notice that the in-axis means of isotropic energies are about one order of magnitude larger than the out-axis means for both short and long bursts except the Supernova-associated gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, we apply all the newly-found energy relations to construct the Hubble diagrams of out/in-axis bursts. It is found that the in-axis Hubble diagrams are better cosmological indicators.\n\n", "2508.04277": "2025-08-06, **Stringent constraint on the CCC+TL cosmology with $H(z)$ Measurements**, Lei Lei et.al., [2508.04277v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04277v1)\n\n Recently, the Covarying Coupling Constants and Tired Light (CCC+TL) hybrid model was proposed to explain the unexpectedly small angular diameters of high-redshift galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that are challenging to reconcile with the $\\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we test the CCC+TL model against model-independent Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements obtained from cosmic chronometers. It turns out that the parameter set optimized for the type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) dataset within the CCC+TL model fails to reproduce the $H(z)$ data, but the $\\Lambda$CDM model works well. Statistical comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) strongly favors $\\Lambda$CDM over CCC+TL for the $H(z)$ data, with $\\Delta \\mathrm{BIC} = 60.85$. Additionally, the fit of the CCC+TL model to the $H(z)$ data results in a best-fit value for the speed-of-light variation index parameter $\\alpha$ disagreeing with that for the SN Ia data at the $\\sim 6\\sigma$ level, demonstrating significant internal tension within the CCC+TL framework.\n\n", "2508.04053": "2025-08-06, **A second-generation star in a relic dwarf galaxy**, Anirudh Chiti et.al., [2508.04053v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04053v1)\n\n Stars that contain only trace amounts of elements heavier than helium, referred to as having low \"metallicity\", preserve the chemical fingerprints of the first generation of stars and supernovae. In the Milky Way, the lowest metallicity stars show an extreme over-abundance of carbon relative to other elements, which has been hypothesized to be a unique result of the first low-energy supernovae. However, the origin of this signature has remained a mystery, since no such stars have been discovered in the ancient dwarf galaxies where they are thought to have formed. Here, we present observations of a star in the >10 billion year old ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Pictor II, that shows the lowest iron and calcium abundances outside the Milky Way (<1/43,000th solar and ~1/160,000th solar), with a factor of >3000x relative carbon enhancement. As the first unambiguous second-generation star in a relic dwarf galaxy, this object demonstrates that carbon-enhanced second-generation stars can originate in primordial small-scale systems. This star supports the hypothesis that carbon-enhancement is produced by low-energy-supernovae, since the yields of energetic supernovae are harder to retain in small-scale environments. This key local signature of chemical enrichment by the first stars traces a regime inaccessible to current high-redshift observations, which cannot detect the early enrichment of the smallest galaxies.\n\n"}}
