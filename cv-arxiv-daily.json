We show that these data are in remarkably good agreement with a set of models that assume the emission to be produced by the Galactic population of cosmic rays if its spectral shape traces that measured by CALET and DAMPE as well as KASCADE at higher energies. No extra-components besides the CR sea is needed to explain LHAASO results. Accounting for unresolved sources, we consistently reproduce Tibet AS$\\gamma$ as well as a wide set of $\\gamma$-ray data at lower energy. To do this, we consider two different transport setups: a conventional one and a $\\gamma$-optimized spatial-dependent one (a development of the widely adopted KRA$\\_\\gamma$ model). We demonstrate that both setups are compatible with LHAASO results. However, the latter is preferred if one takes into account Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data and neutrino measurements. In fact, we also compute the associated Galactic neutrino diffuse emission finding that the contribution from sources cannot be dominant and showing that spatial-dependent propagation models closely match the ANTARES and IceCube best fits for the Galactic Center Ridge and the Galactic Plane emissions. We argue that our $\\gamma$-optimized model should be used as a template for future analyses of upcoming data from the Global Neutrino Network.\n\n", "2502.18256": "2025-02-25, **Constraints on Lorentz invariance violation in neutrino sector from the ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A**, Yu-Ming Yang et.al., [2502.18256v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18256v1)\n\n Lorentz invariance is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime and serves as the cornerstone of modern physics, supporting the constancy of the speed of light. A crucial implication of this principle is that no particle can propagate faster than this universal speed limit. In this study, we present a stringent neutrino-based test of Lorentz invariance, utilizing the highest-energy neutrino ever detected, known as event KM3-230213A.

Interestingly, the form of such interaction is inferred from the non-conservation of the stress energy tensor in $f(R, T)$ gravity rather than being introduced in a phenomenological manner. Furthermore, the parameters that distinguish RVE from $\\Lambda$CDM are fixed once the parameter of $f(R,T)$ gravity, $\\lambda$, is known. To illustrate our setup, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of three interaction scenarios using a combination of different data. we find that the parameters characterizing the RVE model are very small as expected. These results give an accuracy to this equivalence between $f(R,T)$ gravity under consideration and support the recent result obtained from a quantum field theory in curved space-time point of view which could open a new relationship between $f(R,T)$ gravity and quantum field theory. Finally, the interaction of the running vacuum increases the value of the current value of the Hubble rate by $3.5\\%$ compared to the $\\Lambda$CDM model, which may be a promising study for the Hubble tension.\n\n", "2502.18005": "2025-02-25, **WIMP Dark Matter Search using a 3.1 tonne $\\times$ year Exposure of the XENONnT Experiment**, E.

Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.\n\n", "2502.17792": "2025-02-25, **Cosmological constraints on two vacuum decay models**, Yupeng Yang et.al., [2502.17792v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17792v1)\n\n We constrain two vacuum decay models ($\\Lambda(t)$CDM, proposed by the authors of~\\cite{Brito:2024bhh}) utilizing the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance prior from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observed by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained via the cosmic chronometers (CC) method and type Ia supernova (SNIa) data.

Despite significant advancements in quantum sensing, prevailing efforts have focused predominantly on refining the underlying sensor materials and hardware. Given the growing demands of increasingly complex application domains and the continued evolution of quantum sensing technologies, the present moment is the right time to systematically explore distributed quantum sensing architectures and their corresponding design space.   We present STQS, a unified system architecture for spatiotemporal quantum sensing that interlaces four key quantum components: sensing, memory, communication, and computation. By employing a comprehensive gate-based framework, we systemically explore the design space of quantum sensing schemes and probe the influence of noise at each state in a sensing workflow through simulation. We introduce a novel distance-based metric that compares reference states to sensing states and assigns a confidence level. We anticipate that the distance measure will serve as an intermediate step towards more advanced quantum signal processing techniques like quantum machine learning. To our knowledge, STQS is the first system-level framework to integrate quantum sensing within a coherent, unified architectural paradigm. STQS provides seamless avenues for unique state preparation, multi-user sensing requests, and addressing practical implementations. We demonstrate the versatility of STQS through evaluations of quantum radar and qubit-based dark matter detection. To highlight the near-term feasibility of our approach, we present results obtained from IBM's Marrakesh and IonQ's Forte devices, validating key STQS components on present day quantum hardware.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2502.17902": "2025-02-25, **Dissecting the formation of gas-versus-star counter-rotating galaxies from the NewHorizon simulation**, S. Peirani et.al., [2502.17902v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17902v1)\n\n (Reduced) Using the NewHorizon simulation, we have studied ten gas-versus-star counter-rotating galaxies in field environments with a stellar mass of M*~[1-5]x10^10 Msun. For all of them, the retrograde accretion of gas either from gas stripping from a nearby companion or from the circumgalactic medium is the starting point of the formation process. Then follows the co-existence of two distinct disks of gas rotating in opposite directions, the pre-existing one in the inner parts and the accreted gas in the outer parts of the galaxy. The latter progressively replaces the former leading to the final gas-star kinetic misalignment configuration. During the process, the star formation is first enhanced and then progressively decreases. We roughly estimate that a higher fraction of the pre-existing gas is converted into stars rather than being expelled. We also found that the black hole activity (BH) tends to be enhanced during the removal of the pre-existing gas. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the formation of a counter-rotating gas component is always accompanied with the formation of counter-rotating stellar disks. These stellar disks can have diverse properties but host in general a younger and more metal rich population of stars with respect to the main disc, depending on the star formation history and BH activity. The central part of counter-rotating disks tend also to be characterized by a younger population, an enhanced star formation rate and a higher metallicity than their outer parts. The high metallicity comes the progressive metal enrichment of the accreted gas by mixing with the pre-existing gas and by supernovae activity as it sinks toward the center of the galaxy. In case of major mergers, a large amount of accreted stars from the companion would be distributed at large distances from the remnant center due to conservation of the initial orbital angular momentum.\n\n", "2502.17792": "2025-02-25, **Cosmological constraints on two vacuum decay models**, Yupeng Yang et.al., [2502.17792v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17792v1)\n\n We constrain two vacuum decay models ($\\Lambda(t)$CDM, proposed by the authors of~\\cite{Brito:2024bhh}) utilizing the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance prior from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observed by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained via the cosmic chronometers (CC) method and type Ia supernova (SNIa) data.
