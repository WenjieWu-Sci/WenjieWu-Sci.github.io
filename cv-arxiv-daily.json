We exemplify this approach using the T2K near detector as a working example, focusing on learning the posterior probability distribution of neutrino flux binned in neutrino energy. The predictions of the trained model are conditioned at inference time by the momentum and angle of the outgoing muons released after neutrino-nuclei interaction. This conditioning allows for the generation of personalized posterior distributions, tailored to the muon observables, all without necessitating a full retraining of the model for each new dataset. The performances of the model are studied for different shapes of the posterior distributions.\n\n", "2312.02022": "2023-12-04, **Neutrino emission of neutron-star superbursts**, A. D.

We note a universal relation for the temperature distribution in the burnt layer at its neutrino cooling stage, as well as the unification of bolometric light curves and neutrino heat loss rates for deep and powerful bursts.

We consider two light quark flavors and current-current interactions in the scalar-pseudoscalar, vector, and diquark pairing channels, where the nonlocality of the currents is taken into account by a Gaussian form factor that depends on the spatial components of the 4-momentum. Within this framework, we analyze order parameters, critical temperatures, phase diagrams, equation of state, and mass-radius relations for different temperatures and neutrino chemical potentials. For parameters of the model that are constrained by recent multi-messenger observations of neutron stars, we find that the mass-radius diagram for isothermal hybrid star sequences exhibits the thermal twin phenomenon for temperatures above 30 MeV.\n\n", "2312.01718": "2023-12-04, **Type-II Seesaw Leptogenesis along the Ridge**, Chengcheng Han et.al., [2312.01718v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01718v1)\n\n Type-II seesaw leptogenesis is a model that integrates inflation, baryon number asymmetry, and neutrino mass simultaneously. It employs the Affleck-Dine mechanism to generate lepton asymmetry, with the Higgs bosons serving as the inflaton. Previous studies assumed inflation to occur in a valley of the potential, employing the single-field approximation. In this work, we explore an alternative scenario for the type-II seesaw leptogenesis, where the inflation takes place along a ridge of the potential. Firstly, we conduct a comprehensive numerical calculation in the canonical scenario, where inflation occurs in a valley, confirming the effectiveness of the single-field approximation. Then, we introduce a novel scenario wherein inflation initiates along the potential's ridge and transitions to the valley in the late stages. In this case, the single-field inflation approximation is no longer valid, yet leptogenesis is still successfully achieved. We find that this scenario can generate a significant non-Gaussianity signature, offering testable predictions for future experiments.\n\n", "2312.01693": "2023-12-04, **Chiral perturbative evaluation for the (second) lightest mass $M_{1,2}$ of right-handed neutrino $\u03bd_{R 1,2}$ in unified theories with sequential dominance**, Masaki J.

Using an alternative formulation of the field equations in terms of a Codazzi tensor, we obtain various non-trivial CG exact solutions that generalize known GR solutions: FLRW cosmologies, Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) and Szekeres dust solutions, as well as static perfect fluid spheres and solutions with a shear-free 4 velocity. We show that CG modifies the spatial curvature of the nonstatic GR solutions. Demanding a well posed initial value formulation keeps the same dynamics of FLRW models of GR, but with the cosmological constant interpreted as constant spatial curvature. In other solutions the modification of spatial curvature allows for self-consistent significant changes in the dynamics, an time and spece dependent evolution from decelerated to accelerated expansion driven by negative spatial curvature and without necessarily assuming a dark energy source or imposing a cosmological constant. The $\\Lambda$CDM model naturally emerges as the unique FLRW dust model of CG with constant negative spatial curvature. Static fluid spheres in the weak field regime of CG allow for modeling the flattening of rotation velocities in galactic systems without assuming dark matter.

We investigate whether a consistent embedding into quantum gravity can decimate the number of solutions to the dark-matter problem. Concretely, we focus on a hidden sector composed of a gauge field and a charged scalar, with gauge group U(1)$\\_{\\textmd{D}}$ or SU(2)$\\_\\textmd{D}$. The gauge field is the dark-matter candidate, if the gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously. Phenomenological constraints on the couplings in this model arise from requiring that the correct dark matter relic density is produced via thermal freeze-out and that recent bounds from direct-detection experiments are respected. We find that the consistent embedding into asymptotically safe quantum gravity gives rise to additional constraints on the couplings at the Planck scale, from which we calculate corresponding constraints at low energy scales. We discover that phenomenological constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously with theoretical constraints from asymptotically safe quantum gravity, ruling out these dark-matter models.\n\n", "2312.02046": "2023-12-04, **Stellar mass is not the best predictor of galaxy metallicity.

Several scaling relations involving the galaxy metallicity have been discovered through the years, the foremost of which is the scaling with stellar mass. This so-called mass-metallicity relation is thought to be fundamental and has been subject to many studies in the literature. We study the dependence of the gas-phase metallicity on many different galaxy properties to assess which of them determines the metallicity of a galaxy. We applied a random forest regressor algorithm on a sample of more than 3000 nearby galaxies from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. Using this machine-learning technique, we explored the effect of 148 parameters on the global oxygen abundance as an indicator of the gas metallicity. $M\\_{\\rm \\star}$/$R\\_e$, as a proxy for the baryonic gravitational potential of the galaxy, is found to be the primary factor determining the average gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy ($Z\\_g$). It outweighs stellar mass. A subsequent analysis provides the strongest dependence of $Z\\_g$ on $M\\_\\star / R\\_e^{\\,0.6}$. We argue that this parameter traces the total gravitational potential, and the exponent $\\alpha\\simeq 0.6$ accounts for the inclusion of the dark matter component.

This relation is tighter and likely more primordial than the widely known mass-metallicity relation.\n\n", "2312.02005": "2023-12-04, **Remote sensing of backward reflection from stimulated axion decay**, Kensuke Homma et.al., [2312.02005v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02005v1)\n\n We propose a method for remotely detecting backward reflection via induced decay of cold dark matter such as axion in the background of a propagating coherent photon field.

In this paper, we provide a numerical timing model for PSR-SMBH systems based on the post-Newtonian (PN) equation of motion, and use it to explore the prospects of measuring the black hole (BH) properties with pulsar timing. We further consider the perturbation caused by the dark matter (DM) distribution around Sgr~A*, and the possibility of constraining DM models with PSR-SMBH systems. Assuming a 5-year observation of a normal pulsar in an eccentric ($e=0.8$) orbit with an orbital period $P\\_b = 0.5\\,$yr, we find that -- with weekly recorded times of arrival (TOAs) and a timing precision of 1 ms -- the power-law index of DM density distribution near the GC can be constrained to about 20%.

We perform cosmological parameter measurements based on full shape analysis of the power spectrum of all three tracers. We conduct this full shape analysis with the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFTofLSS). EDE is known to strongly suffer from volume projection effects, which makes the interpretation of cosmological constraints challenging. To quantify the volume projection effects within an EDE full shape analysis, we explore the impact of different prior choices on the nuisance parameters of EFTofLSS through an extensive mock study. We compare classical Gaussian priors to the non-informative Jeffreys prior, known to mitigate volume projection effects in $\\Lambda$CDM. Our full shape analysis combines eBOSS and BOSS data with Planck, external Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), PantheonPlus, and SH0ES supernova data.

One of the possible hypotheses is that when the protoplanetary disk of the solar system had already formed, a very close $(<1\\,\\mathrm{pc})$ supernova (SN) injected radioactive material directly into the disk. Such a $^{26}$Al injection hypothesis has been tested so far with very limited setups for disk structure and supernova distance, and then by comparing disruption and injection conditions separately. We extend this problem to analytically investigate whether there are conditions under which the surviving disk radius can confine enough $^{26}$Al for planet formation while allowing some disk disruption. We also consider a variety of i) disk mass and structure, ii) $^{26}$Al yields from SNs, and iii) large dust mass fraction $\\eta\\_\\mathrm{d}$.

Simulations are able to investigate the roles of gravity, feedback, turbulence, heating and cooling, and magnetic fields on the physics of the interstellar medium, and star formation. Compared to simulations of individual clouds, galactic and sub-galactic scale simulations can include larger galactic scale processes such as spiral arms, bars, and larger supernovae bubbles, which may influence star formation. Simulations show cloud properties and lifetimes in broad agreement with observations. Gravity and spiral arms are required to produce more massive GMCs, whilst stellar feedback, likely photoionisation, leads to relatively short cloud lifetimes. On larger scales, supernovae may be more dominant in driving the structure and dynamics, but photoionisation may still have a role. In terms of the dynamics, feedback is probably the main driver of velocity dispersions, but large scale processes such as gravity and spiral arms may also be significant. Magnetic fields are generally found to decrease star formation on galaxy or cloud scales, and simulations are ongoing to study whether clouds are sub or supercritical on different scales in galaxy scale simulations. Simulations on subgalactic scales, or zoom in simulations, allow better resolution of feedback processes, filamentary structure within clouds, and the study of stellar clusters.\n\n"}}
