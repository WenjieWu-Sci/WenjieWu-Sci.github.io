We study the impact of these improved estimates on the validity of texture-zeros in the light neutrino mass matrix by assuming neutrinos to be of Majorana nature. Considering a diagonal charged lepton basis, we revisit the previously allowed one-zero and two-zero textures and check their validity by using updated neutrino data from JUNO. While JUNO data rule out one previously allowed two-zero texture, they also make predictions for other neutrino parameters more precise. We finally study the prospects of probing the currently allowed texture-zeros and their predicted correlations among neutrino parameters at future long baseline neutrino experiments like the DUNE.

In this paper, we develop self-consistent leptonic, hadronic, and leptohadronic models that reproduce both the observed spectrum and morphology of the source. Purely leptonic models are energetically more favorable yet they require rather specific morphological assumptions. The gamma-ray morphology of the source can be better explained within a hadronic scenario based on the identification of cold gas structures spatially correlated with the observed gamma-ray emission. However, a purely hadronic model for the source emission requires a substantial energy reservoir in protons and fails to reproduce the extended X-ray emission recently detected by XRISM. We show that emission including a combination of leptonic and hadronic components can reproduce both the spectral and morphological properties of the source. We provide predictions for the X-ray and neutrino spectra of~the~nebula that can discriminate the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the overall source signal.\n\n", "2512.13158": "2025-12-15, **Testable Inverse Seesaw Motivated from a High Quality QCD Axion**, Yannis Georis et.al., [2512.13158v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13158v1)\n\n The QCD axion remains one of the most compelling solutions to the strong CP problem. Meanwhile, the type-I seesaw mechanism offers an elegant explanation for the lightness of the observed neutrino masses; however, its extremely heavy Majorana states place it far beyond experimental reach. Low-scale alternatives such as the inverse seesaw improve testability but typically lack a strong theoretical motivation. In this paper we bridge this gap by showing that gauging the discrete symmetry $\\mathbb Z\\_4 \\times \\mathbb Z\\_3$-motivated by the internal structure of the Standard Model-naturally yields a QCD axion with a high-quality Peccei-Quinn symmetry solving the strong CP problem, while simultaneously enforcing the field content and hierarchy required for a natural inverse seesaw. The resulting model is highly predictive and has the potential to be fully tested by future experiments.

The model integrates the Peccei-Quinn symmetry with the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses. This allows for spontaneous leptogenesis, which generates the required $B-L$ asymmetry around the seesaw scale. The necessary initial axion kinetic misalignment is naturally sourced by a PQ field driving pole inflation. Analysis within the KSVZ axion model demonstrates that achieving simultaneous correct DM abundance and baryon asymmetry limits the axion decay constant to be smaller than about $10^9$ GeV.

In this paper, we complete this general study of the cosmological history for a unit domain-wall number option of the DFSZ-type, dubbed VISH$\u03bd$, by performing a detailed lattice-informed analysis of the reheating era. In doing so, we make inflationary and leptogenesis predictions more precise through estimates of the reheating temperature and the expansion history. The viable reheating scenarios, which at the same time satisfy strict conditions for naturalness (radiative stability), are also shown to respect dark radiation bounds. We also characterise the high-frequency spectrum of gravitational waves, and mention other phenomenological implications that distinguish VISH$\u03bd$ from alternative proposals.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2512.13648": "2025-12-15, **The impact of non-Gaussianity when searching for Primordial Black Holes with LISA**, Antonio Junior Iovino et.al., [2512.13648v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13648v1)\n\n LISA can observe cosmological millihertz (mHz) gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds that may offer a decisive test for asteroid-mass primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM). In standard scenarios, failing to detect a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background would exclude the last viable window for PBH DM formed through critical collapse. We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity.

At large $\\|\u03a6\\|$, higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operators become relevant and impart a kick in the angular direction, generating a conserved $U(1)$ charge that sustains rotation as the symmetry is approximately restored. Because phases randomize across causally disconnected regions, multiple domains with distinct charges form. The subsequent axion potential converts the domain charges into an axion abundance, yielding dark matter even when the net global charge vanishes. We analyze the dynamics through a linear, domain-averaged treatment and identify two thermal histories: (i) Ricci reheating via saxion decays to Higgs bosons; (ii) external reheating with efficient damping of saxion energy by Higgs/fermion scatterings.

The hadronic matter equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field approach, constrained by chiral effective field theory ($\u03c7$EFT) calculations at low densities, finite nuclei and heavy-ion collision data at intermediate densities, and neutron star (NS) observations at high densities. For the dark sector, we consider fermionic dark matter (FDM) interacting via a dark vector meson, and two bosonic dark matter models (BDM1 and BDM2) characterized by self-interacting scalar fields. Bayesian inference is employed to constrain the model parameters, including the dark matter mass, coupling strength, and dark matter fraction within NSs. Our analysis finds that all models yield consistent nuclear matter parameters, allowing a small dark matter fraction under 10%. The presence of dark matter slightly softens the EoS, leading to a modest reduction in NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability, though all models remain compatible with NICER and GW170817 observations.

It plays a key role in forming close binaries such as hot subdwarfs, double white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and double neutron stars. However, its outcomes remain highly uncertain. Depending on the efficiency of envelope ejection, a system may either survive as a close binary or undergo a complete merger. In this work, we investigate the post merger evolution of systems where a CO WD mergers with the core of an AGB star. A grid of merger remnant models with various core and envelope masses is constructed. At the onset of evolution, the CO core contracts and undergoes off-center carbon ignition, producing an inwardly propagating carbon flame. For remnants with relatively low mass of CO core, the flame phase is followed by core contraction and subsequent H-shell burning. For more massive CO cores, the carbon flame reaches the center and is soon followed by off-center neon burning, which is expected to eventually lead to core-collapse supernovae. The merger remnants occupy nearly the same region on HR diagram as ordinary AGB or super-AGB stars, exhibiting similar surface properties. Although their surface abundance may differ slightly from those of normal AGB stars depending on the initial core and envelope masses, these differences are strongly reduced once mass-loss is taken into account.
