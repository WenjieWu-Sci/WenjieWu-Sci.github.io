We obtain seven daily consecutive spectral-energy distributions (SEDs) of the flare in the infra-red, optical, ultra-violet, X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray bands with publicly available data. We simulate the physical conditions in the blazar and show that the observed SEDs are well reproduced in the framework of a \"standing feature\" where the position of the emitting region is almost stationary, located beyond the outer radius of the broad-line region and into which fresh blobs of relativistically moving magnetized plasma are continuously injected. Meanwhile, a model with a single \"moving blob\" does not describe the data well. We obtain a robust upper limit to the amount of high-energy protons in the jet of 3C 454.3 from the electromagnetic SED. We construct a neutrino light curve of 3C 454.3 and estimate the expected neutrino yield at energies $\\geq 100$ TeV for 3C 454.3 to be up to $6 \\times 10^{-3}$ $\\nu\\_{\\mu}$ per year. Finally, we extrapolate our model findings to the light curves of all Fermi-LAT flat-spectrum radio quasars. We find that next-generation neutrino telescopes are expected to detect approximately one multimessenger ($\\gamma + \\nu\\_{\\mu}$) flare per year from bright blazars with neutrino peak energy in the hundreds TeV -- hundreds PeV energy range and show that the electromagnetic flare peak can precede the neutrino arrival by months to years.\n\n", "2502.12070": "2025-02-17, **KM3NeT Constraint on Lorentz-Violating Superluminal Neutrino Velocity**, KM3NeT Collaboration et.al., [2502.12070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12070v1)\n\n Lorentz invariance is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime and foundational to modern physics. One of its most important consequences is the constancy of the speed of light. This invariance, together with the geometry of spacetime, implies that no particle can move faster than the speed of light. In this article, we present the most stringent neutrino-based test of this prediction, using the highest energy neutrino ever detected to date, KM3-230213A.

A. Dzhatdoev et.al., [2502.11434v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11434v1)\n\n The KM3Net Collaboration has recently reported on the observation of a remarkable event KM3-230213A that could have been produced by an ultra high energy cosmic neutrino. The origin of this event is still unclear. In particular, the cosmogenic neutrino scenario is not favoured due to the non-observation of a similar event by the IceCube detector, and most galactic scenarios are disfavoured as well. We show that the blazar PKS 0605-085 is a viable source of the KM3-230213A event. In particular, even though this blazar is located at 2.4$^{\\circ}$ from the KM3-230213A event, the association between the blazar and the event is not unlikely due to a sizable direction systematic uncertainty of $\\approx 1.5^{\\circ}$ reported by the KM3Net Collaboration. Furthermore, we show that the observation of a $\\approx$72 PeV neutrino from PKS 0605-085 is entirely possible given that a $\\approx$7.5 PeV neutrino could have been observed from another blazar TXS 0506+056. Finally, we consider $\\gamma$-ray constraints on the number of observable neutrino events and show that for the case of the external photon field production mechanism these constraints could be relaxed due to the often-neglected effect of the isotropisation of the hadronically-produced electrons in the magnetic field of the blob.

We study how such networks of defects appear in the context of string theory, and discuss the conditions for their long-term stability. In a scenario with several axions, we show how a bias term in the potential arises naturally from the effects of multiple instantons, leading to the eventual decay of the domain walls. We find that the annihilation of the network leads to the generation of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) with a spectrum that has characteristic contributions from both walls and strings. The unique shape of the spectrum provides an opportunity to probe string theory axions at existing and upcoming observatories. The extinction of the network is also accompanied by the production of different axion mass eigenstates. In a region of the parameter space, the lightest eigenstate can be long lived and make up the dark matter in the universe.\n\n", "2502.12101": "2025-02-17, **Bondi-like Accretion Flow Dynamics: The Role of Gravitational Potential**, Razieh Ranjbar et.al., [2502.12101v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12101v1)\n\n The formation of massive black holes and their coevolution with host galaxies are pivotal areas of modern astrophysics. Spherical accretion onto a central point mass serves as a foundational frame- work in cosmological simulations, semianalytical models, and observational studies. This work extends the classical spherical accretion model by incorporating the gravitational potential of host galaxies, including contributions from stellar components and dark matter halos. Numerical solutions spanning parsec-scale to event-horizon-scale regimes reveal that the flow structure is highly sensitive to the mass and size of the dark matter halo. Adding low angular momentum to the accreting gas demonstrates that such flows resemble spherical Bondi accretion, with mass accretion rates converging towards the Bondi rate. We find that the low angular momentum flow resembles the spherical Bondi flow and its mass accretion rate approaches the Bondi accretion rate. Due to the presence of dark matter, the mass accretion rate is increased by a factor of more than ~ %100 in comparison to analogous hydrodynamic solutions. These findings underscore the critical role of stellar and dark matter gravitational poten- tials in shaping the dynamics and accretion rates of quasi-spherical flows, providing new insights into astrophysical accretion processes.\n\n", "2502.12100": "2025-02-17, **3D Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter**, Ph. Brax et.al., [2502.12100v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12100v1)\n\n We study the formation and the dynamics of vortex lines in rotating scalar dark matter halos, focusing on models with quartic repulsive self-interactions. In the nonrelativistic regime, vortex lines and their lattices arise from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of motion, as for superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates studied in laboratory experiments. Indeed, in such systems vorticity is supported by the singularities of the phase of the scalar field, which leads to a discrete set of quantized vortices amid a curl-free velocity background. In the continuum limit where the number of vortex lines becomes very large, we find that the equilibrium solution is a rotating soliton that obeys a solid-body rotation, with an oblate density profile aligned with the direction of the total spin. This configuration is dynamically stable provided the rotational energy is smaller than the self-interaction and gravitational energies. Using numerical simulations in the Thomas-Fermi regime, with stochastic initial conditions for a spherical halo with a specific averaged density profile and angular momentum, we find that a rotating soliton always emerges dynamically, within a few dynamical times, and that a network of vortex lines aligned with the total spin fills its oblate profile. These vertical vortex lines form a regular lattice in the equatorial plane, in agreement with the analytical predictions of uniform vortex density and solid-body rotation. These vortex lines might further extend between halos to form the backbone of spinning cosmic filaments.\n\n", "2502.12072": "2025-02-17, **General relativistic quasi-spherical accretion in a dark matter halo**, Razieh Ranjbar et.al., [2502.12072v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12072v1)\n\n Context. The Bondi spherical accretion solution has been used to model accretion onto compact objects in a variety of situations, from interpretation of observations to subgrid models in cosmological simulations. Aims. We aim to investigate how the presence of dark matter (DM) alters the dynamics and physical properties of accretion onto supermassive black holes on scales ranging from ~ 10 pc to the event horizon. Methods. In particular, we investigate Bondi-like accretion flows with zero and low specific angular momentum around supermassive black holes surrounded by dark-matter halos by performing 1D and 2.5D general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) simulations using the black hole accretion code (BHAC). Results. We find notable differences in the dynamics and structure of spherical accretion flows in the presence of DM. The most significant effects include increases in density, temperature, and pressure, as well as variations in radial velocity both inside and outside the regions containing DM or even the production of outflow. Conclusions. This investigation provides valuable insights into the role of cosmological effects, particularly DM, in shaping the behavior of accretion flows and black holes (BHs). Our simulations may be directly applicable to model systems with a large black hole-to-halo mass ratio, which are expected to be found at very high redshifts.\n\n", "2502.12030": "2025-02-17, **Fuzzy dark matter fails to explain the dark matter cores**, Mar\u00eda Benito et.al., [2502.12030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12030v1)\n\n Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are ideal for studying dark matter (DM) due to minimal baryonic effects.

First, we outline the key properties of PBHs and how they meet the requirements to be a dark matter candidate. We then overview how PBHs can form, in particular from the collapse of large density perturbations generated by inflation (a proposed period of accelerated expansion in the early Universe). Next, we describe how PBHs can be probed by observations.

The reactivation of dark matter annihilation during the structure formation epoch is possible if there is a small Majorana mass term that breaks the conservation of dark matter particle number, leading to oscillations between dark matter and its antiparticle. We analyzed the effects of the annihilation mechanism in the galaxy rotation curves of the SPARC and LITTLE THINGS catalogs. We searched for the characteristics of the OADM model which best describes the data. Our results show that the OADM model can successfully turn originally cusp-type halos into core-type ones according to our data sample.\n\n", "2502.11872": "2025-02-17, **Issues in the Investigations of the Dark Matter Phenomenon in Galaxies: Parcere Personis, Dicere de Vitiis**, Paolo Salucci et.al., [2502.11872v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11872v1)\n\n It is always more evident that the kinematics of galaxies provide us with unique information on the Nature of the dark particles and on the properties of the galaxy Dark Matter (DM) halos.

We demonstrate that our reconstruction is likely to be optimal for this setup and that it is highly effective at reducing redshift-space distortions.

By combining the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole, and bispectrum monopole up to $k\\_{\\rm{max}} = 0.52 \\text{ h}/\\text{Mpc}$, our joint analysis of pre- and post-reconstructed fields from the Quijote simulation suite finds improved marginalized errors on all cosmological parameters.

Maldonado et.al., [2502.11325v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11325v1)\n\n The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion scheme applied to binary systems has long struggled to produce reliable mass accretion efficiencies when the stellar wind velocity of the donor star is smaller than the orbital velocity of the accretor. This limitation is significant in symbiotic systems where such conditions exist. Recently, our group introduced a geometric correction to the standard implementation of the BHL model that demonstrates improved agreement with numerical simulations. The present work investigates the impact of this new implementation on the evolution of symbiotic systems. We model systems where 0.7 and 1 M$\\_\\odot$ white dwarfs accrete material from Solar-like stars with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 M$\\_\\odot$. The primary star is evolved using the MESA stellar evolution code, while the orbital dynamics of the system are calculated using REBOUND. The analysis focuses on the red giant branch and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phases. We compare three scenarios: no accretion, standard BHL accretion, and the improved wind accretion. Our results show that the choice of accretion prescription critically influences the evolution of symbiotic systems. Simulations using the modified model did not reach the Chandrasekhar limit, suggesting that type Ia supernova progenitors require accretors originating from ultra-massive WDs. In contrast, the standard BHL model predicts WD growth to this limit in compact systems. This discrepancy suggests that population synthesis studies adopting the traditional BHL approach may yield inaccurate results. The revised model successfully reproduces the accretion properties of observed symbiotic systems and predicts transitions between different accretion regimes driven by donor mass-loss variability. These results emphasize the need for updated wind accretion models to accurately describe the evolution of symbiotic binaries.\n\n"}}
