In this work, we re-examine the limits set by existing detectors such as CHARM and NuCal, and by future experiments such as FASER2, MATHUSLA, and SHiP. We extend previous works by i) considering several mass regimes of the Dark Sector (DS) particles, leading to an extended lifetime regime of the unstable species, ii) including LLPs production occurring in previously neglected vector meson decays that actually dominate the LLP yield, and iii) by implementing secondary LLP production. It takes place by Primakoff-like upscattering of lighter DS species into LLP on tungsten layers of neutrino emulsion detector FASER$\\nu$2. This process will allow FASER2 to cover a significant portion of the $\\gamma c\\tau \\sim 1\\,m$ region of the parameter space that is otherwise difficult to cover due to the large ($\\sim O(100)\\,m$) distance between the primary LLP production point and the decay vessel, where LLP decays take place, which is required in typical beam-dumb experiments for SM background suppression.\n\n", "2305.10305": "2023-05-17, **Effects of Kaluza-Klein Neutrinos on $R_{D}$ and $R_{D^{*}}$**, Janus Capellan Aban et.al., [2305.10305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10305v1)\n\n Recent measurements of $R\\_{D}$ and $R\\_{D^{*}}$ by the LHCb collaboration show deviations from their respective Standard Model values. These semileptonic $B$ meson decays, associated with $b\\rightarrow c \\tau \\bar{\\nu}$ transition, are pointing toward new physics beyond the Standard Model via leptonic flavor universality violation.

We found that the number of extra dimension should be 2 to explain $R\\_{D}$ and $R\\_{D^{*}}$. We show that both $R\\_{D}$ and $R\\_{D^{*}}$ constraint the energy scale $M\\_{F}$ of this extra dimension which are compatible with the limits from lepton flavor violating tau decays.

The hidden sector interacts with the Standard Model through the neutrino portal, allowing the relic abundance of dark matter to be set by annihilation into final states containing neutrinos. The coupling to the hidden sector also leads to the generation of neutrino masses through the inverse seesaw mechanism, with composite hidden sector states playing the role of the singlet neutrinos. We focus on the scenario in which the hidden sector is conformal in the ultraviolet, and the compositeness scale lies at or below the weak scale. We construct a holographic realization of this framework based on the Randall-Sundrum setup and explore the implications for experiments. We determine the current constraints on this scenario from direct and indirect detection, lepton flavor violation and collider experiments and explore the reach of future searches. We show that in the near future, direct detection experiments and searches for $\\mu \\rightarrow e$ conversion will be able to probe new parameter space. At colliders, dark matter can be produced in association with composite singlet neutrinos via Drell Yan processes or in weak decays of hadrons.

The neutrino emission is also the dominating cooling mechanism for a proto-neutron star, whose interior is mainly composed of extremely dense and hot nuclear matter. Neutrino transport is an essential part of the simulation of these phenomena, and modern codes are able to implement inelastic neutrino scattering and also to some extent its angle distribution. We therefore study the energy and angle dependence of neutrino scattering rates in proto-neutron star and supernova matter with the full Skyrme RPA response functions. We confirm earlier findings obtained in the Landau approximation that the RPA reduces neutrino scattering, but the detailed differential scattering rates in hot and dense matter depend sensitively on the adopted interaction. The scattering angle distribution is different for different interactions because it depends strongly on the neutron Fermi velocity. We also find that many Skyrme interactions present an unphysical feature that the Fermi velocity of neutrons exceeds the speed of light already at relatively low densities.\n\n", "2305.09383": "2023-05-16, **Observation of collider muon neutrinos with the SND@LHC experiment**, The SND@LHC Collaboration et.al., [2305.09383v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09383v1)\n\n We report the direct observation of muon neutrino interactions with the SND@LHC detector at the Large Hadron Collider.

In particular, we introduce the dependence on the cosmic web environment (knots, filaments, sheets, voids) in the model, thereby effectively accounting for non-local bias. Furthermore, we include a detailed treatment of velocity bias in the redshift space distortions modelling, allowing the velocity bias to be cosmic-web dependent. We find evidence for a significant difference of the same model parameters in different environments, suggesting that for the investigated setup the simple standard FGPA is not able to adequately predict the Lyman-alpha forest in the different cosmic web regimes. We reproduce the summary statistics of the reference cosmological hydrodynamic simulation we use for comparison, yielding accurate mean transmitted flux, probability distribution function, 3D power spectrum, and bispectrum.

Due to the extremely low mass of the constituent particle ($\\sim 10^{-22}$ eV), ULDM can exhibit quantum effects up to kiloparsec scales. In particular, runaway collapse in the centres of ULDM halos is prevented by quantum pressure, providing a possible resolution to the 'core-cusp problem' of CDM. However, the the detailed relationship between the ULDM core mass and that of the overall halo is poorly understood. We simulate the collapse of both spherical and aspherical isolated ULDM overdensities using AxioNyx, finding that the central cores of collapsed halos undergo sustained oscillatory behaviour which affects both their peak density and overall morphology. The variability in core morphology increases with the asphericity of the initial overdensity and remnants of initial asphericity persist long after collapse. Furthermore, the peak central densities are higher in spherical configurations. Consequently, astrophysically realistic halos may exhibit substantial departures from theoretical core-halo profiles and we would expect a significant variance of the properties of halos with the same mass.\n\n", "2305.10315": "2023-05-17, **WIMP decay as a possible Warm Dark Matter model**, Abineet Parichha et.al., [2305.10315v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10315v1)\n\n The Weakly Interacting Massive Particles(WIMPs) have long been the favored CDM candidate in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. However, owing to great improvement in the experimental sensitivity in the past decade, some parameter space of the SUSY-based WIMP model is ruled out. In addition, WIMP as the CDM particle is also at variance with other astrophysical observables at small scales. We consider a model that addresses both these issues. In the model, the WIMP decays into a massive particle and radiation. We study the background evolution and the first order perturbation theory (coupled Einstein-Boltzmann equations) for this model and show that the dynamics can be captured by a single parameter $r=m\\_L/q$, which is the ratio of the lighter mass and the comoving momentum of the decay particle. We incorporate the relevant equations in the existing Boltzmann code CLASS to compute the matter power spectra and CMB angular power spectra. The decaying WIMP model is akin to a non-thermal Warm Dark Matter(WDM) model and suppresses matter power at small scales, which could alleviate several issues that plague the CDM model. We compare the predictions of the model with CMB, galaxy clustering, and high-z HI data. Both these data sets yield $r\\gtrsim 10^6$, which can be translated into the bounds on other parameters.

This method is found to be orders of magnitude more efficient than direct numerical solvers while still producing highly accurate and reliable results. A code implementation of the Chebyshev spectral method is then presented and characterised. The code has been made publicly available alongside this paper. We expect our method to be of use for interpretation of upcoming galaxy clustering measurements.\n\n", "2305.09188": "2023-05-16, **Axion-like particle (ALP) portal freeze-in dark matter confronting ALP search experiments**, Dilip Kumar Ghosh et.al., [2305.09188v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09188v1)\n\n The relic density of Dark Matter (DM) in the freeze-in scenario is highly dependent on the evolution history of the universe and changes significantly in a non-standard (NS) cosmological framework prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). In this scenario, an additional species dominates the energy budget of the universe at early times (before BBN), resulting in a larger cosmological expansion rate at a given temperature compared to the standard radiation-dominated (RD) universe. To investigate the production of DM in the freeze-in scenario, we consider both standard RD and NS cosmological picture before BBN and perform a comparative analysis. We extend the Standard Model (SM) particle content with a SM singlet DM particle $\\chi $ and an axion-like particle (ALP) $a$. The interactions between ALP, SM particles, and DM are generated by higher dimensional effective operators. This setup allows the production of DM $\\chi$ from SM bath through the mediation of ALP, via ALP-portal processes. These interactions involve non-renormalizable operators, leading to ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in, which depends on the reheating temperature ($T\\_{RH}$) of the early universe. In the NS cosmological scenario, the faster expansion rate suppresses the DM production processes, allowing for enhanced effective couplings between the visible and dark sectors to satisfy the observed DM abundance compared to RD scenario. This improved coupling increases the detection prospects for freeze-in DM via the ALP-portal, which is otherwise challenging to detect in RD universe due to small couplings involved. Using an effective field theory set-up, we show that various ALP searches such as in FASER, DUNE, and SHiP, etc. will be able to probe significant parameter space depending on the different model parameters.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2305.10144": "2023-05-17, **White dwarf cooling in $f(R,T)$ gravity**, Snehasish Bhattacharjee et.al., [2305.10144v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10144v1)\n\n In recent times, astounding observations of both over- and under-luminous type Ia supernovae have emerged. These peculiar observations hint not only at surpassing the Chandrasekhar limit but may also suggest potential modifications in the physical attributes of their progenitors, such as their cooling rate. This, in turn, can influence their temporal assessments and provide a compelling explanation for these intriguing observations. In this spirit, we investigate here the cooling process of white dwarfs in $f(R,T)$ gravity with the simplest model $f(R,T) = R + \\lambda T$, where $\\lambda$ is the model parameter. Our modelling suggests that the cooling timescale of white dwarfs exhibits an inverse relationship with the model parameter $\\lambda$, which implies that for identical initial conditions, white dwarfs in $f(R,T)$ gravity cool faster. This further unveils that in the realm of $f(R,T)$ gravity, the energy release rate for white dwarfs increases as $\\lambda$ increases. Furthermore, we also report that the luminosity of the white dwarfs also depends on $\\lambda$ and an upswing in $\\lambda$ leads to an amplification in the luminosity, and consequently a larger white dwarf in general relativity can exhibit comparable luminosity to a smaller white dwarf in $f(R,T)$ gravity.\n\n", "2305.10030": "2023-05-17, **Reducing the uncertainty on the Hubble constant up to 35\\% with an improved statistical analysis: different best-fit likelihoods for Supernovae Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Quasars, and Gamma-Ray Bursts**, Maria Giovanna Dainotti et.al., [2305.10030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10030v1)\n\n Cosmological models and their parameters are widely debated, especially about whether the current discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant, $H\\_{0}$, obtained by type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and the Planck data from the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation could be alleviated when alternative cosmological models are considered. Thus, combining high-redshift probes, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and Quasars (QSOs), together with Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and SNe Ia is important to assess the viability of these alternative models and if they can cast further light on the Hubble tension. In this work, for GRBs, we use a 3-dimensional relation between the peak prompt luminosity, the rest-frame time at the end of the X-ray plateau, and its corresponding luminosity in X-rays: the 3D Dainotti fundamental plane relation. Regarding QSOs, we use the Risaliti-Lusso relation among the UV and X-ray luminosities for a sample of 2421 sources. We correct both the QSO and GRB relations by accounting for selection and evolutionary effects with a reliable statistical method. We here use both the traditional Gaussian likelihoods ($\\cal L\\_G$) and the new best-fit likelihoods ($\\cal L\\_N$) to infer cosmological parameters of a non-flat $\\Lambda$CDM and flat $w$CDM models.

W. Lewis et.al., [2305.09721v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09721v1)\n\n Observations of the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen are poised to revolutionize our knowledge of cosmic reionization and the high-redshift population of galaxies. However, harnessing such information requires robust and comprehensive theoretical modeling. We study the non-linear effects of hydrodynamics and astrophysical feedback processes, including stellar and AGN feedback, on the 21cm signal by post-processing three existing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation: Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and Eagle. Overall and despite their different underlying galaxy-formation models, the three simulations return similar predictions for the global 21cm rightness temperature and its power spectrum. At fixed redshift, most differences are attributable to differences in the history of reionization, in turn driven by differences in the build-up of stellar sources of radiation. However, the impact of astrophysics is imprinted in the 21cm power spectrum through several unique signatures. First, we find significant small scale ($k \\geq 10\\, \\rm {Mpc}^{-1}$) differences between Illustris and IllustrisTNG, where higher velocity winds generated by supernova feedback soften density peaks and lead to lower 21cm power in TNG. Second, we find more 21cm power at intermediate scales ($k \\approx 0.8\\, \\rm {Mpc}^{-1}$) in Eagle, due to differences in ionization driven by highly effective stellar feedback, leading to lower star formation, older and redder stellar populations, and thus lower ionizing luminosities. Though subtle, these features could allow future observations of the 21cm signal, in conjunction with other reionization observables, to constrain theoretical models for galactic feedback at high redshift.\n\n", "2305.09714": "2023-05-16, **An empirical study of dust properties at the earliest epochs**, Joris Witstok et.al., [2305.09714v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09714v1)\n\n We present an empirical analysis of the properties of dust-continuum emission in a sample of 17 galaxies in the early Universe ($4 < z < 8$) with well-sampled far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) compiled from the literature. We place our results into context by self-consistently comparing to samples of nearby star-forming galaxies, luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), and quasars. With the exception of two sources, we find no significant evolution in the dust emissivity index across cosmic time, measuring a consistent value of $\\beta\\_\\text{IR} = 1.8 \\pm 0.3$ at $z > 4$, suggesting the effective dust properties do not change dramatically for most galaxies. Despite having comparable stellar masses, we find the high-redshift galaxies to be similar to, or even more extreme than, LIRGs in the HERUS sample in terms of dust temperature ($T\\_\\text{dust} > 40 \\, \\mathrm{K}$) and IR luminosity ($L\\_\\text{IR} > 10^{11} \\, \\mathrm{L\\_\\odot}$).

This peculiar object exploded in the outskirts of a metal-poor, low-surface brightness galaxy (i.e., $M\\_{g}$ = $-$14.5 mag). Our photometric analysis reveals that SN 2016ije is subluminous ($M\\_{B,\\rm{max}}$ = $-$17.65$\\pm$0.06 mag) but exhibits relatively broad light curves (${\\Delta}m\\_{15}(B)$ = 1.35$\\pm$0.14 mag), similar to the behavior of SN 2002es. Our analysis of the bolometric light curve indicates that only 0.14$\\pm$0.04 $M\\_{\\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion of SN 2016ije, which suggests a less energetic thermonuclear explosion when compared to normal SNe Ia, and this left a considerable amount of unburned materials in the ejecta. Spectroscopically, SN 2016ije resembles other SN 2002es-like SNe Ia, except that the ejecta velocity inferred from its carbon absorption line ($\\sim$ 4500 km s$^{-1}$) is much lower than that from silicon lines ($\\sim$ 8300 km s$^{-1}$) at around the maximum light. Additionally, most of the absorption lines are broader than other 02es-like SNe Ia. These peculiarities suggest the presence of significant unburned carbon in the inner region and a wide line-forming region along the line of sight. These characteristics suggest that SN 2016ije might originate from the violent merger of a white dwarf binary system, when viewed near an orientation along the iron-group-element cavity caused by the companion star.\n\n", "2305.09388": "2023-05-16, **Physics of Binary Star Evolution -- from Stars to X-ray Binaries and Gravitational Wave Sources**, Thomas M. Tauris et.al., [2305.09388v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09388v1)\n\n The majority of all stars are members of a binary system. The evolution of such binary stars and their subsequent production of pairs of compact objects in tight orbits, such as double neutron stars and double black holes, play a central role in modern astrophysics, Binary evolution leads to the formation of different types of violent cosmic events such as novae, supernova explosions, gamma-ray bursts, mass transfer and accretion processes in X-ray binaries, and the formation of exotic radio millisecond pulsars. In some cases, the binary systems terminate as spectacular collisions between neutron stars and/or black holes. These collisions lead to powerful emission of gravitational waves, as detected by LIGO since 2015. The coming decade is expected to reveal a large number of discoveries of binary compact systems, as well as their progenitors and merger remnants, from major instruments such as the radio Square-Kilometre Array; the gravitational wave observatories LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA-IndIGO and LISA; the astrometric space observatory Gaia; the James Webb Space Telescope; and the X-ray space observatories eXTP, STROBE-X, and Athena. In this light, it is important to have a modern textbook on the physics of binary stars evolution, from ordinary stars to X-ray binaries and gravitational wave sources. The scope of this book is that the reader (student or educated expert) will learn the physics of binary interactions, from stellar birth to compact objects, and relate this knowledge to the latest observations. The reader will learn about stellar structure and evolution, and detailed binary interactions covering a broad range of phenomena, including mass transfer and orbital evolution, formation and accretion onto compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes), and their observational properties.
