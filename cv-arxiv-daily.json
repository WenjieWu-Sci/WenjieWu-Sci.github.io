The measurement of the Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum along the line of sight from high-redshift quasar spectra provides information on the shape of the linear matter power spectrum, neutrino masses, and the properties of dark matter. In this work, we use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based estimator, which is validated on synthetic data in a companion paper. Compared to the FFT measurement performed on the DESI early data release, we improve the noise characterization with a cross-exposure estimator and test the robustness of our measurement using various data splits. We also refine the estimation of the uncertainties and now present an estimator for the covariance matrix of the measurement. Furthermore, we compare our results to previous high-resolution and eBOSS measurements. In another companion paper, we present the same DR1 measurement using the Quadratic Maximum Likelihood Estimator (QMLE). These two measurements are consistent with each other and constitute the most precise one-dimensional power spectrum measurement to date, while being in good agreement with results from the DESI early data release.\n\n", "2505.09176": "2025-05-14, **Late-time suppression of structure growth as a solution for the $S_8$ tension**, Ryo Terasawa et.al., [2505.09176v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09176v1)\n\n The $S\\_8$ value inferred from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Year 3 cosmic shear data, under the assumption of the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, is 2-3$\\sigma$ lower than that inferred from observations of the early-time universe, such as cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data. Resolving the $S\\_8$ tension requires a scenario in which structure formation on small scales is suppressed in the late universe. As potential solutions, we consider extended models both within and beyond the $\\Lambda$CDM model -- models that incorporate parameterized baryonic feedback effects, the effect of varying neutrino mass, and modified structure growth, each of which can lead to a suppression of structure growth at lower redshifts, with its own distinct scale- and redshift-dependencies. In particular, we consider phenomenological modified gravity models in which the suppression of structure growth is triggered at lower redshifts, as dark energy ($\\Lambda$) begins to dominate the background expansion. We show that the modified growth factor models -- especially those featuring more rapid growth suppression at lower redshifts -- provide an improved fit to the combined datasets of the HSC-Y3 cosmic shear correlation functions, the Planck CMB, and the ACT DR6 CMB lensing, compared to the fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM model and the models including the baryonic effects or the massive neutrino effect within the the $\\Lambda$CDM framework.\n\n", "2505.09153": "2025-05-14, **Neutrino Fluence influenced by Memory Burdened Primordial Black Holes**, Arnab Chaudhuri et.al., [2505.09153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09153v1)\n\n Primordial black holes (PBHs), formed in the early Universe, are capable of emitting both Standard Model (SM) and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) particles via Hawking radiation. We investigate the impact of the recently proposed memory burden effect which is a quantum gravitational backreaction that suppresses black hole evaporation once approximately half the PBH mass is lost on the production of high energy neutrinos. In particular, we examine how this suppression modifies the time-integrated muon neutrino flux, with and without the inclusion of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) as BSM states. We compute the resulting neutrino fluence for different suppression strengths and analyze the prospects for detection in neutrino telescopes such as IceCube. Our results show that the memory burden significantly alters the neutrino energy spectrum, particularly at high energies, and that the presence of HNLs can counterbalance this suppression by introducing additional neutrino production channels. These findings have important implications for the detectability of PBH evaporation signatures and the parameter space of HNLs in cosmological settings.\n\n", "2505.09111": "2025-05-14, **Measuring the Cosmic Ray Spectrum with Next Generation Neutrino Detectors**, Stephan A.

These detectors provide full-sky coverage and long-term monitoring, unlike traditional satellite and balloon experiments that measure cosmic ray flux at specific altitudes and locations. By analyzing the atmospheric neutrino flux generated by cosmic ray interactions, we demonstrate that future detectors can differentiate between various cosmic ray models with high statistical significance, even when accounting for uncertainties in neutrino cross sections and hadronic interactions.

It is realized in two-stage inflation where a non-inflationary stage is sandwiched by the two inflationary stages. In this case, smaller PBHs form when the comoving scale of interest re-enters the horizon during the break period, and larger PBHs form when the scale re-enters the horizon after inflation. This mechanism may realize both reheating of the universe through the evaporation of ultralight PBHs formed during the break stage and the dark matter by those formed after inflation. We show that this scenario may give rise to a distinctive signature in the stochastic gravitational wave background that can be tested by the near-future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA and DECIGO.

While it is known that such tails are universal to a certain extent, a precise characterization of their key ingredients is missing. Here we provide an analytical proof that the tail fall-off is universal for any effective potential asymptotically decaying as $1/r^2$, while the power law decay is different if the potential decays as $1/r^\\alpha$ with $1<\\alpha<2$. This result extends and revises some previous work and is in agreement with numerical analyses. Our proof is based on an analytical evaluation of the branch cut contribution to the Green function, and includes charged black holes, different kinds of perturbations, Teukolsky equation for the Kerr metric, exotic compact objects, extensions of General Relativity, and environmental effects.

To meet these requirements, we are investigating a tungsten Transition Edge Sensor (TES) provided by NIST, which operates in its superconducting transition region at millikelvin temperatures. This sensor exploits the drastic change in resistance caused by the absorption of a single photon. We find that the background observed in the setup with a fiber-coupled TES is consistent with Black Body Radiation (BBR) as the primary background contributor. A framework was developed to simulate BBR propagation to the TES under realistic conditions. The framework not only allows the exploration of background reduction strategies, such as improving the TES energy resolution, but also reproduces, within uncertainties, the spectral distribution of the observed background.

We analyse the embedding diagram of the WH obtained here with the study of the proper radial distance, volume integral quantifier, and anisotropy measurement in this model. The vanishing sound speed in the model is analyzed, and found that the WH is stable at the throat for $\\alpha = -0.0512471$ for a set of model parameters.

Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak Chern-Simons couplings to electromagnetism, gravity, and fermions. We propose a novel symmetry-breaking detection mechanism in magnetoelectric materials, allowing for a linear axionic coupling between magnetism and ferroelectric polarization. We focus on strain gradient Sr2IrO4, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P\\|\\|M enables direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field within the material. This mechanism amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. These signals can be detected by monitoring changes in macroscopic physical quantities, such as the magnetoelectric and magnetic responses. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism significantly enhances the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.\n\n", "2505.08409": "2025-05-13, **Observational constraints on the Kerr and its several single-parameter modified spacetimes using quasi-periodic oscillation data**, Shining Yang et.al., [2505.08409v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08409v1)\n\n This paper investigates the dynamical effects of particles moving in the Kerr spacetime and its nine single-parameter modified spacetimes, including Bardeen, Ayon-Beato and Garcia (ABG), Hayward, Kerr-Newman (KN), Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN), Braneworld Kerr (BK), Kerr-MOG, Kerr-Sen, and Perfect Fluid Dark Matter (PFDM) black holes.

We constrain the modification parameters for the nine single-parameter modified spacetimes and provide the spin and mass ranges of three microquasars within the ten spacetime models (including Kerr) at the $68\\%$ confidence level (CL). The results demonstrate that, at the $68 \\%$ CL, the QPO data impose stringent constraints on the free parameters, as evidenced by the narrow confidence intervals. Among them, only the KN spacetime yields a modification parameter constraint spanning both negative and positive values (encompassing the Kerr case at zero). In contrast, all other tested geometries mandate positive-definite parameters at $68 \\%$ CL, demonstrating statistical deviation of the Kerr solution. This highlights the significance of exploring modifications to the Kerr spacetime. Finally, we evaluate the spacetime models using the Bayes factor and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Based on the current QPO observational data, the Bayesian factor analysis indicates that the ABG, Hayward, KN, BK, and Kerr-MOG spacetime have a slight advantage over the Kerr solution, while the Bardeen, KTN, Kerr-Sen, and PFDM spacetime are somewhat inferior to the Kerr model.

Kaplan et.al., [2505.08358v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08358v1)\n\n Three possible strategies have been advocated to solve the strong CP problem. The first is the axion, a dynamical mechanism that relaxes any initial value of the CP violating angle $\\bar{\\theta}$ to zero. The second is the imposition of new symmetries that are believed to set $\\bar{\\theta}$ to zero in the UV. The third is the acceptance of the fine tuning of parameters. We argue that the latter two solutions do not solve the strong CP problem. The $\\theta$ term of QCD is not a parameter - it does not exist in the Hamiltonian. Rather, it is a property of the quantum state that our universe finds itself in, arising from the fact that there are CP violating states of a CP preserving Hamiltonian. It is not eliminated by imposing parity as a symmetry since the underlying theory is already parity symmetric and that does not preclude the existence of CP violating states. Moreover, since the value of $\\theta$ realized in our universe is a consequence of measurement, it is inherently random and cannot be fine tuned by choice of parameters. Rather any fine tuning would require a tuning between parameters in the theory and the random outcome of measurement. Our results considerably strengthen the case for the existence of the axion and axion dark matter. The confusion around $\\theta$ arises from the fact that unlike classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian are not equivalent in quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian defines the differential time evolution, whereas the Lagrangian is a solution to this evolution. Consequently, initial conditions could in principle appear in the Lagrangian but not in the Hamiltonian. This results in aspects of the initial condition such as $\\theta$ misleadingly appearing in the Lagrangian as parameters.

However, most, if not all, multidimensional simulations struggle to reproduce the scatter of observed SNe around this relation, exceeding it substantially. In this study, we investigate whether the excessive scatter around the Phillips relation can be caused by an off-center ignition of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core in the double detonation scenario and if this can help constrain possible SN Ia explosion channels. We simulated the detonation of three different initial CO white dwarfs of $0.9$, $1.0$, and $1.1\\,M\\_\\odot$, artificially ignited at systematically offset locations using the Arepo code. After nucleosynthetic postprocessing, we generated synthetic observables using the Artis code and compared these results against observational data and models of other works.

The majority of the viewing angle variability seems to be caused by line blanketing in the blue wavelengths of intermediate-mass elements and lighter iron-group elements, which are asymmetrically distributed in the outer layers of the ashes. Our results suggest that although the off-center ignition of the CO introduces substantial line of sight effects, it is not responsible for the excessive viewing angle scatter observed in other models. Instead, this effect seems to be caused by the detonation ashes from the rather massive helium (He) shells in current state-of-the-art models. Further reducing the He-shell masses of double detonation progenitors may be able to alleviate this issue and yield observables that reproduce the Phillips relation.\n\n", "2505.09284": "2025-05-14, **Generating Full-field Evolution of Physical Dynamics from Irregular Sparse Observations**, Panqi Chen et.al., [2505.09284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09284v1)\n\n Modeling and reconstructing multidimensional physical dynamics from sparse and off-grid observations presents a fundamental challenge in scientific research. Recently, diffusion-based generative modeling shows promising potential for physical simulation. However, current approaches typically operate on on-grid data with preset spatiotemporal resolution, but struggle with the sparsely observed and continuous nature of real-world physical dynamics. To fill the gaps, we present SDIFT, Sequential DIffusion in Functional Tucker space, a novel framework that generates full-field evolution of physical dynamics from irregular sparse observations. SDIFT leverages the functional Tucker model as the latent space representer with proven universal approximation property, and represents observations as latent functions and Tucker core sequences. We then construct a sequential diffusion model with temporally augmented UNet in the functional Tucker space, denoising noise drawn from a Gaussian process to generate the sequence of core tensors.   At the posterior sampling stage, we propose a Message-Passing Posterior Sampling mechanism, enabling conditional generation of the entire sequence guided by observations at limited time steps. We validate SDIFT on three physical systems spanning astronomical (supernova explosions, light-year scale), environmental (ocean sound speed fields, kilometer scale), and molecular (organic liquid, millimeter scale) domains, demonstrating significant improvements in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n", "2505.08946": "2025-05-13, **On the X-ray Emission From Supernovae, and Implications for the Mass-Loss Rates of their Progenitor Stars**, Vikram V. Dwarkadas et.al., [2505.08946v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08946v1)\n\n We summarize the X-ray emission from young SNe. Having accumulated data on most observed X-ray SNe, we display the X-ray lightcurves of young SNe. We also explore the X-ray spectra of various SN types. The X-ray emission from Type Ib/c SNe is non-thermal. It is also likely that the emission from Type IIP SNe with low mass-loss rates (around 10$^{-7} \\, Msun \\,$ yr$^{-1}$) is non-thermal. As the mass-loss rate increases, thermal emission begins to dominate. Type IIn SNe have the highest X-ray luminosities, and are clearly thermal. We do not find evidence of non-thermal emission from Type IIb SNe. The aggregated data are used to obtain approximate mass-loss rates of the progenitor stars of these SNe. Type IIP's have progenitors with mass-loss rates $< 10^{-5}\\, Msun \\,$ yr$^{-1}$, while Type IIn progenitors generally have mass-loss rates $> 10^{-3}\\, Msun $ yr$^{-1}$. However, we emphasize that the density of the ambient medium is the important parameter, and if it is due to a non-steady outflow solution, it can not be translated into a mass-loss rate.\n\n", "2505.08907": "2025-05-13, **Suppression of Shock X-ray Emission in Novae from Turbulent Mixing with Cool Gas**, Brian D. Metzger et.al., [2505.08907v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08907v1)\n\n Shock interaction in classical novae occurs when a fast outflow from the white dwarf > 1000 km s/s collides with a slower, cooler shell of gas released earlier in the outburst. The shocks radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio synchrotron to GeV gamma-rays. The hot shocked gas also emits >~ keV thermal X-rays, typically peaking weeks after the eruption, once the ejecta becomes transparent to photoelectric absorption. However, the observed hard X-ray luminosities are typically >4 orders of magnitude smaller than would be naively expected given the powerful shocks implied by the gamma-rays. We argue that a key missing piece to this puzzle is turbulence behind the shock, driven, e.g., by thin-shell and/or thermal instabilities. Turbulence efficiently mixes the hot X-ray emitting gas with cooler gas, sapping the hot gas of energy faster than it can directly radiate. Using analytic arguments motivated by numerical simulations, we show that energy losses due to turbulent mixing can easily balance shock heating, greatly reducing the volume of the hot gas and suppressing the X-ray luminosity. Equating the characteristic thickness of the X-ray emitting region to the minimum outer length scale of the turbulence capable of cooling the hot gas through mixing, we obtain X-ray luminosities consistent with nova observations if only ~1% of the shock's kinetic power goes into turbulent motions. A similar process may act to suppress thermal X-rays from other shock powered transients, such as interacting supernovae.\n\n", "2505.08856": "2025-05-13, **Expanding Ejecta Method: II. Framework for Cosmological Distance Measurements via Intensity Interferometry**, David Dunsky et.al., [2505.08856v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08856v1)\n\n We explore the potential of the expanding ejecta method (EEM) as a cosmological probe, leveraging its ability to measure angular diameter distances to supernovae (SNe) with intensity interferometry. We propose three distinct applications of the EEM: (1) using Type IIP SNe as moderate-distance geometric anchors to calibrate Cepheids, replacing other local distance indicators; (2) directly calibrating Type Ia SNe, bypassing conventional calibration methods; (3) constructing a fully independent Hubble diagram with Type IIP (Type Ia) SNe, entirely decoupled from the traditional distance ladder. Incorporating realistic SN populations, we forecast a Hubble constant precision with next-generation intensity interferometers of $1.6\\%$, $1.1\\%$, and $9.3\\% \\,(3.6\\%)$, respectively, for the three different proposed applications. Future intensity interferometry could yield improvements to $1.2\\%$, $0.6\\%$, and $1.5\\%\\,(0.4\\%)$.

These compact objects often receive a velocity at formation, a \"kick\" whose physical origin remains debated. We investigate kicks in Be X-ray binaries, containing a neutron star and a rapidly spinning companion. We identify two distinct populations: one with kicks below $10\\,\\rm{km}\\,\\rm{s}^{-1}$, much lower than theoretical predictions, and another with kicks around $100\\,\\rm{km}\\,\\rm{s}^{-1}$, that shows evidence for being aligned within 5 degrees of the progenitor's rotation axis.

This energy, delivered over ~ 40 days via a quark-nova (QN) shock or the spin-down power of the HS, can reproduce the photometric and spectral features observed in SN 2023aew. In this model, the first light curve peak corresponds to the 56Ni-powered SN resulting from a stripped-envelope progenitor with a zero-age main sequence mass of at least ~ (15-16)M\\_sun. The plateau between the two peaks may result from interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM). Alternatively, it could be explained by the spin-down power of the NS prior to its conversion into a highly magnetized HS, which is responsible for powering the second bump. A scenario involving two phases of spin-down power - first from the NS and later from the HS - is compelling and supports the hypothesis that some magnetars are, in fact, HSs. These HSs acquire their ultra-strong magnetic fields through a quark matter phase capable of sustaining core fields on the order of ~ 1e18 G. In our model, the spin-down energy of the HS powers the QN ejecta - the outermost layers of the NS - before this energy is transferred to the expanded SN ejecta. This process produces luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The model establishes a potential connection between superluminous SNe (SLSNe) and LFBOTs, with significant implications for high-energy astrophysics and the r-process nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Potential consequences for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are also discussed.\n\n", "2505.08332": "2025-05-13, **Improving the detection significance of gravitational wave transient searches with CNN models**, Johann Fernandes et.al., [2505.08332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08332v1)\n\n Gravitational wave (GW) transient searches rely on signal-noise discriminators to distinguish astrophysical signals from noise artefacts. These discriminators are typically tuned towards expected signal morphologies, which may limit their effectiveness as detector sensitivity improves and more complex signals, such as from core collapse supernovae or compact binary mergers featuring precession, higher-order harmonics, or eccentricity, become detectable. In this work, we use a Convolutional Neural Network-based approach to classify noise transients from astrophysical transients, aiming to enhance the sensitivity of existing searches. We evaluate our method on two matched filter based searches, PyCBC-IMBH and PyCBC-HM tuned for Intermediate Mass Black Hole (IMBH) binary systems. Our approach improves the sensitive volume-time reach of these searches by approximately 30% at a false alarm rate of once per 100 years. Finally, we apply our method to the first four chunks of the first half of the third observation run and demonstrate a marked improvement in significance. In particular, we significantly improve the first IMBH binary GW event GW190521 with an IFAR exceeding 42000 years.\n\n", "2505.08184": "2025-05-13, **Insights into the 3D layered structure of nearby open clusters through N-body simulations**, Lang Kaixiang et.al., [2505.08184v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08184v1)\n\n Context. Open clusters (OCs) are important for understanding star formation, dynamics, and evolution. Previous studies have indicated a relationship between cluster structure and member star properties, but the formation mechanism of the layered structure of OCs remains unclear. Aims. We study the three-dimensional spatial distribution of 279 nearby OCs to understand the formation mechanism of the layered structure. Methods. We analyzed the spatial distribution of member stars within each OC and correlated the presence of a layered structure with the number of member stars. Additionally, we performd N-body simulations to model the evolution of OCSN 125. We assessd the correlation between the binary fraction, the most massive star, and the radius of the layered structure in each simulated OC. Results. Our analysis reveals that OCs with fewer member stars tend to lack a layered structure. The results from N-body simulations indicate that the presence of a layered structure is strongly influenced by dynamical factors, particularly the most massive star and the binary fraction. Massive stars drive mass loss through supernova explosions and stellar winds, which weaken the spatial layering. Furthermore, clusters with higher binary fractions exhibit a weaker layered structure, likely due to energy equipartition, dynamical friction, and perturbations caused by binary systems. These factors contribute to delaying core collapse and slowing the emergence of a layered structure. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that dynamical interactions, including the effects of the most massive stars and binary fraction, play a critical role in the formation and disruption of the layered structure in OCs.\n\n"}}
