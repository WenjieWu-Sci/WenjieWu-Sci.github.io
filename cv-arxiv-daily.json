However, neutrino masses from the Planck-suppressed Weinberg operator are typically too small to account for oscillation data. We propose a new model-building approach to low-scale neutrino mass generation, in which an intermediate spontaneous symmetry-breaking scale generates masses and mixings in the heavy neutral lepton (HNL) sector, while leaving an unbroken residual symmetry $G\\_{\\mathrm{res}}$ that forbids light-neutrino masses. The observed light-neutrino masses then arise because gravity breaks $G\\_{\\mathrm{res}}$ via Planck-suppressed operators, inducing the small lepton-number violation required in low-scale seesaw constructions. The HNLs form pseudo-Dirac pairs, with masses potentially within reach of future colliders and complementary tests in precision searches such as charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV). As an illustration, we present a representative realisation of this class of models and show that, for $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operator coefficients, it predicts a region in the ($M\\_R$, $\u0398^2$)-plane that can be testable via displaced-vertex searches at the High-Luminosity (HL) LHC and the FCC-ee.\n\n", "2512.16781": "2025-12-18, **Dark energy and neutrinos along the cosmic expansion history**, Pietro Ghedini et.al., [2512.16781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16781v1)\n\n Recent cosmological measurements are hinting that dark energy may evolve, with its equation of state, $w\\_\\mathrm{DE}$, even showing oscillatory patterns. In this work, we employ a model-independent approach to jointly reconstruct $w\\_\\mathrm{DE}$ and the sum of neutrino masses, $\\sum m\\_\u03bd$, adopting the PCHIP method with seven fixed nodes in which we allow the two parameters to vary. We employ CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Supernovae Ia data to constrain the values of $w\\_\\mathrm{DE}$ and $\\sum m\\_\u03bd$ at each node. We conduct three different analyses in which we reconstruct $w\\_\\mathrm{DE}$: one with fixed $\\sum m\\_\u03bd=0.06~\\mathrm{eV}$; one in which we allow $\\sum m\\_\u03bd$ to vary, and one in which we also reconstruct $\\sum m\\_\u03bd$ using the PCHIP method.

Multi-messenger observations have so far provided the first evidence for a neutrino source, illustrated by the joint detection of the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 in highenergy (HE, E > 1 GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) gamma rays in coincidence with the high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A, identified by IceCube. Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), namely FACT, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, continue to conduct extensive neutrino target-of-opportunity follow-up programs. These programs have two components: followup observations of single astrophysical neutrino candidate events (such as IceCube-170922A), and observation of known gamma-ray sources after the identification of a cluster of neutrino events by IceCube. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of follow-up observations of high-energy neutrino events observed by the four IACTs between September 2017 (after the IceCube-170922A event) and January 2021. Our study found no associations between gamma-ray sources and the observed neutrino events. We provide a detailed overview of each neutrino event and its potential counterparts. Furthermore, a joint analysis of all IACT data is included, yielding combined upper limits on the VHE gamma-ray flux.\n\n", "2512.16554": "2025-12-18, **Double shell structure in supernova 2024ggi**, Kobi Shiran et.al., [2512.16554v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16554v1)\n\n We built a simple toy model of a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta composed of two shells, an outer low-mass spherical shell and an inner elongated massive shell, and show that it can reproduce the evolution of the photospheric radius of SN 2024ggi, Rph(t). During the first week, the larger spherical shell, the S-shell, forms the photosphere. As the shell expands and becomes increasingly transparent, the photosphere moves inward along the mass coordinate, although it grows in size. When the photosphere reaches the long axis of the elongated inner shell, the E-shell begins to contribute to the photosphere, ultimately comprising the entire photosphere. The simple toy model explains the transition of Rph(t) from being concave (decreasing slope) to convex (increasing slope). A single-shell model predicts only concave behavior. The structure of a spherical shell with an inner elongated shell is motivated by the morphologies of several CCSN remnants whose structures have been attributed to multiple pairs of jets in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The deduced multiple-shell ejecta of SN 2024ggi in this study, and of SN 2023ixf in an earlier study, as well as studies of the polarization of SN 2024ggi, are better compatible with the JJEM than with the neutrino-driven mechanism.

Sim\u00f5es et.al., [2512.16517v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16517v1)\n\n We explore the effects of massive neutrinos on the cosmic web using the FLAMINGO simulations. We classify the cosmic web into voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters, and find that massive neutrinos affect the environment by decreasing the volume occupied by clusters and voids. We find that increasing the neutrino mass shifts the volume-weighted density distribution towards higher densities and leads to a more narrow density distribution, which we interpret as neutrinos delaying structure formation. We construct the minimum spanning tree (MST) graph from the subhaloes, adopting a number density chosen to match that expected for DESI-like observations. We show that most MST edges lie in filaments, approximately 70% throughout different simulations, which we link to its sensitivity to neutrino mass. We also link the MST's edge length signal at different scales to different cosmic web environments, with clusters dominating the signal at small scales, voids at longer scales, and filaments at intermediate scales. The strong correlation between MST edges and cosmic web environments reinforces the MST's potential to be used as a classifier for large-scale structure in galaxy surveys. We compare the effects of baryonic physics and massive neutrinos and find that each produces distinct signatures in MST edge lengths. This analysis is performed in 3D space, using the true positions of subhaloes and not accounting for redshift space distortions. Nevertheless, these results emphasise the MST's capability to go beyond two-point statistics, motivating future applications to real observational data.\n\n", "2512.16427": "2025-12-18, **CHIC: Caley-Hamilton, Invariants and Constants for Neutrino Oscillation Probabilities and Gradients**, Pablo Fern\u00e1ndez-Men\u00e9ndez et.al., [2512.16427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16427v1)\n\n We use the Caley-Hamilton theorem to derive analytical solutions for the three-flavor neutrino propagation amplitude in a constant-density medium and their derivatives with respect to the mixing parameters. This approach avoids the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and exploits precomputed matrix invariants to separate the dependence of oscillation probabilities on neutrino energy and propagation baseline. The results are implemented in the CHIC software, which provides simple, fast and efficient computation of oscillation probabilities and their derivatives. Finally, we demonstrate the value of probability gradients for neutrino data analyses and introduce a complementary visualization, the oscillograds, to probe underlying features of neutrino mixing.\n\n", "2512.16281": "2025-12-18, **Neutrino Propagation in Quantum Field Theory at Short and Long Baselines**, Vadim A. Naumov et.al., [2512.16281v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16281v1)\n\n In a quantum field approach to neutrino oscillations, the neutrino is treated as a propagator, while the external initial and final particle states are described by covariant wave packets. For the asymptotic behavior on short and long macroscopic baselines, the wave packet modified neutrino propagator is expressed through asymptotic series in powers of dimensionless Lorentz and rotation invariant variables. In both regimes, leading-order corrections violate the classical inverse-square law and lead to a decrease in the neutrino-induced event rate.

Yet, many theoretical models involving such particles predict very similar phenomenology and nearly identical final-state signatures. In view of this, we study the capabilities of upcoming experiments -- specifically the DUNE near detectors -- to distinguish between different classes of long-lived particles and the mechanisms by which they are produces.

The quintuplet fermions decay into standard model gauge bosons via the scalars, producing unique collider signatures at the LHC characterized by multilepton and multijet final states. The study focuses on the pair production of quintuplet fermions in the 700-1200 GeV mass range, where their decays produce highly boosted W and Z bosons identifiable as fatjets. Emphasis is placed on the production and decay of doubly charged fermions due to their higher cross section. Advanced jet substructure and kinematic techniques are applied to enhance sensitivity by reducing standard model backgrounds. A detailed analysis of signal significance is performed in the two lepton, two fatjet and three lepton, one fatjet channels for different masses of the fermion and the scalars, optimizing selection cuts to maximize signal efficiency over standard model backgrounds. The study found that both channels exhibit excellent performance, with significance exceeding $5\u03c3$ under realistic conditions including a 50\\% background uncertainty at integrated luminosity up to 3000 fb$^{-1}$.\n\n", "2512.16100": "2025-12-18, **Visible and Invisible Pseudoscalar Meson Decays from Anomaly Sum Rules**, Xurong Chen et.al., [2512.16100v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16100v1)\n\n The decays of pseudoscalar mesons to real and virtual photons as well as neutrino-antineutrino pairs are considered in the framework of the dispersive method based on Anomaly Sum Rules. The contribution of singlet channel involving the new non-perturbative gluon form factor of virtual photon $B(q^2)$ is systematically taken into account. The detailed analysis of its dependence on photon virtuality $q^2$ relying on the available data for meson transition fomfactors is performed. It is shown that B has quite a nontrivial structure at $q^2 \\sim 1 GeV^2$ which may be a signal of the existence of pseudoscalar glueball with a mass about 1.5-2 GeV. The calculation of the decay to $\u03bd\\bar \u03bd$ pairs leads to the compatibility with the result of Arnellos, Marciano and Parsa of 1982, when pion decay is considered neglecting the mixing effects. The account for these effects results, however, in the enhancement of pion branching ratio by a factor of 3, while that for eta decay is larger by several orders of magnitude. It is stressed, that dependence on the pair invariant mass is entirely defined by QCD and coincides with that of the meson transition form factor.

It is fruitful to devise parameterizations of these distortions with only a few parameters which depend on the physical system considered. A method proposed by Stebbins consists in describing a distorted spectrum as a sum of thermalized spectra with a distribution of temperatures, the moments of which are the parameters of interest. After revisiting and extending this approach by working at the level of the number density distribution instead of the standard spectrum, we build another method which consists in describing the distorted spectrum by a polynomial modulating a reference thermalized spectrum. The distortion parameters are then the coefficients of a decomposition on a suitable orthonormal polynomial basis. We advocate that the latter is computationally easier and allows to describe a wide range of distortions. With this formalism, we efficiently describe the standard distortions of the cosmological backgrounds of neutrinos and photons, and we obtain model-independent constraints on nonstandard distortions of these cosmological relics.\n\n", "2512.15860": "2025-12-17, **Particle Production by Time-Varying Dark Energy and the End of Cosmic Expansion**, Nicolas Patino et.al., [2512.15860v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15860v1)\n\n We consider various possible consequences of time-varying dark energy due to a quintessence scalar field whose energy density is partially converted to particles as the field evolves down its potential. This particle production acts as a source of thermal friction on the field that can make it difficult to distinguish whether dark energy is due to a radiating field rolling down a steep potential, a purely self-interacting field moving down a flatter potential, or a cosmological constant. By reducing the acceleration of the scalar field, thermal friction increases the amount of accelerated expansion and can cause a sizable bump in the quintessence equation of state. We take special interest in the case where a steep potential rapidly changes from positive to negative as the field evolves, resulting in the end of cosmic expansion and the beginning of contraction. Even in this case, we find that thermal friction lengthens the period of accelerated expansion and consequently delays the end of cosmic expansion, making it challenging to detect the impending transition to contraction using conventional cosmological tests. However, particle production can also provide alternative avenues for detection by generating a background of thermal dark radiation, partly comprised of neutrinos or other particles, whose energy density exceeds the remnant photon energy density.\n\n", "2512.15846": "2025-12-17, **GRHayL: a modern, infrastructure-agnostic, extensible library for GRMHD simulations**, Samuel Cupp et.al., [2512.15846v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15846v1)\n\n Interpreting multi-messenger signals from neutron stars and black holes requires reliable general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations across rapidly evolving high-performance-computing platforms, yet key algorithms are routinely rewritten within infrastructure-specific numerical-relativity codes, hindering verification and reuse.

We present a science case for next-generation wide-field spectroscopic surveys targeting $1 < z < 6$ with simultaneous observations of thousands of galaxies, quasars, and emission-line galaxies. Such surveys would deliver transformative advances: (i) cosmological constraints on absolute neutrino masses ($\u03a3m\\_\u03bd\\lesssim 0.015\\,\\mathrm{eV}$), three times more stringent than Stage IV, enabling resolution of the neutrino mass hierarchy; (ii) detection of primordial non-Gaussianity at the level of $f\\_{\\mathrm{NL}} \\sim 1$, probing multi-field inflation; (iii) measurements of structure growth $f\u03c3\\_8(z)$ spanning cosmic time to constrain dark energy and test gravitational modifications.

Guided by analytic scalings and 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar \"Fundamental Plane\" (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radiation-reaction-limited branch and a potential-drop-limited branch. Their intersection defines a transition in $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$ that maps to a gamma-ray visibility threshold on the $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram, above which detectability is set by distance and beaming, and below which both cutoff energy and efficiency decline rapidly. Placing ATNF pulsars and McGill magnetars onto these planes reproduces the observed Fermi occupancy, with millisecond pulsars (MSPs) on the observable side, young pulsars (YPs) straddling the threshold, and magnetars clustering at or just below it. At higher $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$, both MSPs and YPs depart from the maximal radiation-reaction-limited envelope at similar cutoff energies, suggesting that enhanced pair creation screens the accelerating electric field in the ECS.

Their long wavelengths make them susceptible to diffraction by cosmic structures, providing an unprecedented opportunity to map dark matter substructures. Identifying lensed events requires the analysis of thousands to millions of simulated events to reach high statistical significances. This is computationally prohibitive with standard GW parameter estimation methods. We build on top of state-of-the-art neural posterior algorithms to accelerate the lensed inference from CPU days to minutes with DINGO-lensing. We showcase its capabilities by reanalyzing GW231123, the most promising lensed candidate so far, and find that its statistical significance cannot exceed 4$\u03c3$. We observe that 8% of GW231123-like nonlensed simulations favor lensing, which could be explained by the self-similarity of short-duration signals. Still, 58% of GW231123-like lensed simulations have larger support for lensing, showing that higher detection statistics are possible.

The modified expansion history and the entropy injection at reheating, can affect the final energy fraction of dark matter. In this paper, we revisit the calculation of the freeze-out and freeze-in dynamics, showing additional effects on top of the standard dilution factor if the dark matter production is completed during the supercooling stage. We show for the first time how these effects can be particularly interesting for direct detection, as the parameter space for WIMP-like candidates shifts from excluded to allowed regions, and freeze-in candidates get closer to experimental reach. A phenomenological motivation to consider supercooling is the associated gravitational wave background. The implications of a finite-duration reheating stage, when the equation of state is close to matter-domination, are a peculiar low-frequency spectrum, and its shift to lower frequencies. These effects are a complementary test of the dynamics that we study for dark matter production, and remarkably can link direct detection of dark matter and gravitational wave astronomy.\n\n", "2512.16783": "2025-12-18, **Consistent Excesses in the LHC Electroweak SUSY Searches: GUT-based Singlino/Higgsino Interpretation in the NMSSM**, Emanuele Bagnaschi et.al., [2512.16783v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16783v1)\n\n The search for supersymmetric models remains one of the main items on the BSM search program at the LHC, with EW SUSY partners still allowed with masses as low as a few hundred GeV.

We find that this scenario is in agreement with all relevant experimental constraints, comprising the LHC searches for SUSY particles and additional Higgs bosons, the LHC Higgs-boson rate measurements, the DM direct detection limits and the upper limit on the DM relic density.

Three experimental series were conducted, each consisting of 4 runs lasting approximately 60 days per run. One can expect an excess in the single electron count rate above the average level if the polarization vector of dark photons in the region traversed by the Sun forms an angle between 20 and 50 degrees with the Earth's rotational axis. Such an effect was observed in the first series (significance 6 sigma) and the second series (significance 4 sigma). However, in the third series, which employed two identical detectors simultaneously, the effect was not observed on either detector. This result practically excludes the possibility that the effect observed earlier was purely instrumental.

Two decades ago, the concept of halo quenching was introduced as a dominant mechanism, positing that massive central galaxy quenching is governed by the thermodynamics of gas predominantly influenced by dark matter halos. However, a vastly increasing body of observational evidence consistently indicates that quenching correlates predominantly with central properties like velocity dispersion, bulge mass, and black hole mass. When these properties are controlled, halo mass appears to show weak influence, supporting AGN feedback as the primary mechanism. A recurring key issue, however, is that these studies rely on halo masses derived via abundance matching (AM). Direct observational measurements from weak lensing, satellite kinematics, and galactic dynamics reveal that AM systematically overestimates halo masses of star-forming centrals while underestimating those of passive ones. To accurately assess the true role of halo mass. we re-estimated halo masses for SDSS groups; the resulting halo mass function and stellar-to-halo mass relations (SHMRs) for both populations match theoretical predictions and weak lensing measurements. Using these improved masses, we find direct observational evidence that halo mass is the dominant factor in quenching central galaxies, with a clear threshold at $M\\_{h}\\sim 10^{12.1}M\\_\\odot; $. By applying a simple correction to AM data using weak lensing-derived SHMRs, we demonstrate that previous claims regarding the dominance of central properties stem primarily from systematic biases in AM halo masses. Our results suggest that the significance of AGN feedback is primarily manifested in halos above this mass threshold, in galaxies already primed for quenching. In other words, AGN feedback appears to become effective in halos above this mass threshold.\n\n", "2512.16162": "2025-12-18, **Probing neutron star interiors and the properties of cold ultra-dense matter with the SKAO**, Avishek Basu et.al., [2512.16162v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16162v1)\n\n Matter inside neutron stars is compressed to densities several times greater than nuclear saturation density, while maintaining low temperatures and large asymmetries between neutrons and protons. Neutron stars, therefore, provide a unique laboratory for testing physics in environments that cannot be recreated on Earth. To uncover the highly uncertain nature of cold, ultra-dense matter, discovering and monitoring pulsars is essential, and the SKA will play a crucial role in this endeavour.

This occurs for loosely bound composite dark matter, where the binding energy per constituent is small, such that scattering with Standard Model nuclei typically imparts enough energy to dissociate a constituent from its composite. Trajectories and cascade profiles are found for dissociated constituents that are further diverted by scattering through the Earth. Such scattering cascades are a common feature of TeV-scale weakly-interacting dark matter loosely bound in composites. We identify underground detector signatures of constituent cascades that depend on composite characteristics; these signatures include non-collinear multiple scatters in detectors, parameter-dependent timing separation of multiscatter events, and regions of parameter space where a dark matter cascade would leave a coincident signature in different underground laboratories.\n\n", "2512.15886": "2025-12-17, **Cored galaxies in cuspy dark matter halos**, Fernando Valenciano et.al., [2512.15886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15886v1)\n\n We investigate constraints on the inner stellar density profile from photometric data of dwarf spheroidal and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Our aim is to clarify under what conditions cored stellar profiles require dark matter halos that are also cored, deviating from the cuspy profiles expected for cold dark matter halos. We consider a variety of spherically symmetric stellar profiles, which we classify as \"strong\" or \"weak\" cores and cusps according to the behavior of the slope ($b\\_0$) and logarithmic slope ($\u03b3\\_0$) at their centers. We explore which profiles lead to unphysical negative distribution functions when embedded in a cuspy halo, treating isotropic and anisotropic kinematics separately. We find that weakly-cored stellar profiles in 3D (i.e., $b\\_0 \\neq 0$, $\u03b3\\_0=0$) can be consistent with cuspy dark matter profiles, but strong 3D cores ($b\\_0=\u03b3\\_0=0$) are not. However, both weak and strong 3D cores yield nearly indistinguishable inner profiles in projection, which implies that ruling out a dark matter cusp from photometric data alone is highly challenging. As an example, we study the profiles of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and find that they are consistent with both weak and strong 3D cores. This is not just a result of the limited numbers of stars in these systems, since we reach the same conclusion even for Fornax, one of the most luminous and best-studied dwarf spheroidal companions of the Milky Way.

We adopt the halo occupation distribution formalism to characterize the evolution of its parameters $M\\_1$ and $\u03b1$ with the mass and redshift selection of our sample. By dividing the halo population into central and satellites, we are able to study their spatial density profile, finding that a Navarro-Frenk-White model is not accurate enough to describe the radial distribution of subhalos, and that a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White model is required instead. Warm dark matter models, in particular, present a cuspier distribution of satellites, whereas self-interacting dark matter exhibits a shallower density profile. Moreover, we find that the small-scale clustering of dark matter halos provides a powerful tool to discriminate between alternative dark matter scenarios, in preparation for a more detailed study that fully incorporates baryonic effects, and for a comparison with observational data from galaxy clustering.\n\n", "2512.15870": "2025-12-17, **Dark Acoustic Oscillations as an Early-Universe Explanation of the DESI Anomaly**, Mathias Garny et.al., [2512.15870v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15870v1)\n\n DESI DR2 data have been widely interpreted as evidence for late-time evolving dark energy (DE) with an apparent phantom crossing. Here we investigate an alternative explanation, based on early-Universe physics. If dark acoustic oscillations (DAO) are close in scale to baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), they can bias the extraction of the BAO scale from the peak in the galaxy correlation function. This leads to an apparent shift in the inferred distance if the superposition of BAO and DAO features is misinterpreted as being due to BAO only. Taking this shift into account, we find that a DAO with percent-level amplitude can reconcile DESI DR2 with Planck 2018 as well as Pantheon+ supernovae data, with fit improvement at a similar level as compared to evolving DE. Notably, a DAO feature with the required properties has been predicted in a previously proposed scenario that resolves the Hubble tension via a pre-recombination decoupling of dark matter and dark radiation (DRMD).

Alternative scenarios, such as warm dark matter (WDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), modify the inner structure of haloes and predict different profile shapes and central slopes. We employ the AIDA-TNG simulations to investigate how alternative dark matter physics and baryonic processes jointly shape the internal structure of haloes. Using dark-matter-only and full-physics runs, we measure the dark matter density profiles of haloes spanning six orders of magnitude in mass, from 10^9.5 Msun to 10^14.5 Msub, and characterise them with multiple analytical models. We provide the distribution of the best-fitting parameters, as well as the concentration-mass relation in WDM and SIDM. The Einasto profile well reproduces the inner flattening produced in WDM models, both in the collisionless and in the full-physics runs. In SIDM dark-matter-only runs, haloes are better described by explicitly cored profiles, with core sizes that depend on mass and on the self-interaction model. When baryons are included, the differences between CDM and SIDM decrease, and such large dark-matter cores no longer form because adiabatic contraction in the baryon-dominated region counteracts self-interactions. Nevertheless, the coupling between baryons and self-interactions induces a broader range of inner slopes, including cases that are steeper than CDM at Milky Way masses. Alternative dark matter physics thus leaves clear signatures in the inner halo structure, even if baryons significantly reshape these differences.

In standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmologies, halos are typically triaxial, with a preference for prolate configurations, particularly at low masses and high redshift. Aims. We focus on the characterization of total matter 3D shape in alternative dark matter models, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM). These scenarios predict different structural properties due to collisional effects or the suppression of small-scale power. Methods. We measure the different halo component shapes - dark matter, stars and gas - at various radii from the center in the AIDA-TNG (Alternative Interacting Dark Matter and Astrophysics - TNG), which is a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations built upon the IllustrisTNG framework. The intent is to systematically study how different dark matter models - specifically, SIDM and WDM - affect galaxy formation and the structure of dark matter halos, when realistic baryonic physics is also included. Results. SIDM models tend to produce rounder and more isotropic halos, especially in the inner regions, as a result of momentum exchange between dark matter particles. WDM halos are also slightly more spherical than their CDM counterparts, and are typically less concentrated. In all cases, the inclusion of self-consistent baryonic physics makes the central regions of all halos rounder, while still revealing clear distinctions among the various dark matter models.

We develop semi-analytic models for the decay of SMBH binaries in ULDM halos and use current pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements to constrain the ULDM particle mass and its fractional contribution to the dark matter content of the universe. We find a median ULDM particle mass of $7. \\times 10^{-22}$ eV and show that scaling relations suggest that the drag remains effective at relatively low ULDM fractions, which are consistent with all other constraints on the model.

It is generally argued that this excess could be due to the presence of warm amorphous carbon dust in the equatorial ring (ER) around the supernova, but the proposed models all have problems.

We argue that the origin of that excess could be attributed instead to a free-free emission. We show that under very specific conditions (the free-free is self-absorbed at a cut-off frequency imposed by the mass of the emitting region), it could be produced by collisional heating of the gas. We then discuss the time evolution of the various components of the SED.

In this work, by using the microscopic EP+IPM (exact pairing plus the independent-particle model) for the nuclear level density (NLD) and extended EP+PDM (exact pairing plus phonon damping model) for the $\u03b3$-ray strength function (gSF), we re-evaluate the substantial enhancement of $^{60}$Fe production recently reported in {\\it A. Spyrou et al., Nat. Comm. {\\bf 15}, 9608 (2024)}, which was attributed to an unexpectedly large Maxwellian-averaged cross section (MACS). Our analysis demonstrates that this enhancement indeed originates from the choice of NLD, which, despite being constrained to reproduce the total NLD and gSF data, lacks a reliable spin dependence, a critical input for Hauser-Feshbach calculations of nuclear reaction rate. In contrast, our predictions yield a significantly lower MACS, calling the claimed enhancement into question. In particular, our approach highlights the microscopic nature of the low-energy enhancement of the gSF, the so-called upbend resonance, which arises from strong particle-particle ($pp$) and hole-hole ($hh$) excitations that emerge only at finite temperature, thereby further reinsisting on the invalidity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis in this low-energy region. Overall, our study reopens the question on the long-standing problem of $^{60}$Fe production in massive stars.\n\n", "2512.15902": "2025-12-17, **Dust evolution across cosmic times as seen through DUSTY-GAEA**, Omima Osman et.al., [2512.15902v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15902v1)\n\n For many decades, dust has been recognised as an important ingredient in galaxy formation and evolution. This paper presents a novel self-consistent implementation of dust formation by stars, destruction by supernova shocks and hot gas, and growth within the dense interstellar medium (ISM) in the GAEA state-of-the-art galaxy formation model. Our new model, DUSTY-GAEA, reproduces well the dust buildup as a function of stellar mass out to z $\\sim$ 6, the scaling relations between the dust-to-gas/dust-to-metal ratios and stellar mass/metallicty in the local Universe, and the dust mass function in the local Universe and out to z $\\sim$ 1. In the framework of our model, dust growth dominates the cosmic dust budget out to z $\\sim$ 8, and we find that observational constraints beyond the local Universe can be reproduced only assuming such efficient dust growth in the dense ISM. Yet, reproducing the estimated number densities of dust-rich galaxies at higher redshifts remains challenging, as found also in independent theoretical work. We discuss our model predictions in comparison with both observational data and independent theoretical efforts, and highlight how further observational constraints at high redshifts would help constrain dust models.\n\n", "2512.15870": "2025-12-17, **Dark Acoustic Oscillations as an Early-Universe Explanation of the DESI Anomaly**, Mathias Garny et.al., [2512.15870v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15870v1)\n\n DESI DR2 data have been widely interpreted as evidence for late-time evolving dark energy (DE) with an apparent phantom crossing. Here we investigate an alternative explanation, based on early-Universe physics. If dark acoustic oscillations (DAO) are close in scale to baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), they can bias the extraction of the BAO scale from the peak in the galaxy correlation function. This leads to an apparent shift in the inferred distance if the superposition of BAO and DAO features is misinterpreted as being due to BAO only. Taking this shift into account, we find that a DAO with percent-level amplitude can reconcile DESI DR2 with Planck 2018 as well as Pantheon+ supernovae data, with fit improvement at a similar level as compared to evolving DE. Notably, a DAO feature with the required properties has been predicted in a previously proposed scenario that resolves the Hubble tension via a pre-recombination decoupling of dark matter and dark radiation (DRMD). The presence of a DAO feature close to the BAO peak can be scrutinized with future full-shape galaxy clustering data from DESI and Euclid.\n\n", "2512.15672": "2025-12-17, **Observational constraints on the spin/anisotropy of the CCOs of Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 and a single surviving continuous gravitational wave candidate**, Jing Ming et.al., [2512.15672v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15672v1)\n\n We carry out the deepest and broadest search for continuous gravitational-wave signals with frequencies between 20-1500 Hz, from three neutron stars at the center of the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr., and G347.3-0.5. This search was made possible by the computing power shared by thousands of Einstein@Home volunteers. After the initial Einstein@Home search, we perform a multi-stage follow-up of the most promising $\\approx$ 45 million signal candidates. In the last stages, we use independent data to further investigate the remaining candidates from the previous stages. We set the most stringent constraints to date on the gravitational-wave amplitude, equatorial ellipticity, r-mode saturation amplitude, and -- for the first time -- the neutron-star crustal anisotropy. For spin periods lower than 2 ms we constrain the ellipticity to be smaller than $4\\times 10^{-7}$ for all targets. We exclude the crustal anisotropy to be smaller than $5\\times 10^{-3}$ for spin periods between 1.3-100 ms. Only one candidate -- from the low frequency G347.3 search -- survives all follow-ups. We illustrate properties of this candidate. Investigations on new data will aid in clarifying its nature.

The standard cosmological model attributes the acceleration to a cosmological constant, but it faces issues like the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy and discrepancies with certain observations. Modified gravity including $f(Q)$ gravity, offers a potential solution by incorporating dynamic dark energy or changes to gravitational interactions, avoiding the need for a constant cosmological term. Also, thesis evaluates the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity by analyzing observational data from Type Ia Supernovae, Hubble parameter measurements and other cosmological datasets.

Effelsberg's continuum view and data release**, Y. Gong et.al., [2512.15054v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15054v1)\n\n Extended radio continuum emission and its linear polarization play a key role in probing large-scale structures of synchrotron and free-free emission in the Milky Way. Despite the existence of many radio continuum surveys, sensitive and high-angular-resolution single-dish surveys of extended radio continuum emission remain scarce. As part of the GLObal view of STAR formation (GLOSTAR) survey, we will also crucially complement the existing data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) by addressing the missing zero-spacing gap. Within the framework of the GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey, we performed large-scale radio continuum imaging observations toward the Galactic plane in the range $-2^{\\circ}< \\ell <60^{\\circ}$ and $\\|b\\|<1.1^{\\circ}$, as well as the Cygnus X region with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. We present the Effelsberg continuum survey at 4.89GHz and 6.82GHz including linear polarization with angular resolutions of 145$^{\\prime\\prime}$ and 106$^{\\prime\\prime}$, respectively. The survey has been corrected for missing large-scale emission using available low-angular-resolution surveys. Comparison with previous single-dish surveys indicates that our continuum survey represents the highest-quality single-dish data collected to date at this frequency. More than 90\\% of the flux density missed by the VLA D-array data is effectively recovered by the Effelsberg continuum survey. The improved sensitivity and angular resolution of our survey enable reliable mapping of Galactic magnetic field structures, with polarization data that are less affected by depolarization than in previous surveys. The GLOSTAR single-dish continuum data will be released publicly, offering a valuable resource for studying extended objects including HII regions, supernova remnants, diffuse interstellar medium, and Galactic structure.
