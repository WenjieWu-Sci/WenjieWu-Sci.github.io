Ritchie-Yates et.al., [2305.08822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08822v1)\n\n New neutrino-nucleus interaction cross-section measurements are required to improve nuclear models sufficiently for future long-baseline neutrino experiments to meet their sensitivity goals. A time projection chamber (TPC) filled with a high-pressure gas is a promising detector to characterise the neutrino sources planned for such experiments. A gas-filled TPC is ideal for measuring low-energy particles as they travel much further in gas than solid or liquid neutrino detectors. Using a high-pressure gas increases the target density, resulting in more neutrino interactions. This paper will examine the suitability of multiwire proportional chambers (MWPCs) taken from the ALICE TPC to be used as the readout chambers of a high-pressure gas TPC. These chambers were previously operated at atmospheric pressure. We tested one such MWPC at up to almost 5 bar absolute (barA) with the UK high-pressure test stand at Royal Holloway, University of London. This paper reports the successful operation of an ALICE TPC outer readout chamber (OROC) at pressures up to 4.8 bar absolute with Ar-CH$\\_{4}$ mixtures with a CH$\\_{4}$ content between 2.8% and 5.0%, and so far up to 4 bar absolute with Ar-CO$\\_{2}$ (90-10). We measured the charge gain of this OROC using signals induced by an $^{55}$Fe source. The largest gain achieved at 4.8 bar was $64\\pm2)\\cdot10^{3}$ at stable conditions with an anode wire voltage of 2990 V in Ar-CH$\\_{4}$ (95.9-4.1). In Ar-CO$\\_{2}$ a gain of $(4.2\\pm0.1)\\cdot10^{3}$ was observed at an anode voltage of 2975 V at 4 barA gas pressure. Based on all our gain measurements, we extrapolate that, at the 10 barA pressure necessary to fit 1 tonne of gas into the ALICE TPC volume, a gain of 5000 in Ar-CO$\\_{2}$ (90-10) (10000 in Ar-CH$\\_{4}$ with $\\sim\\!$ 4% CH$\\_{4}$ content) may be achieved with an OROC anode voltage of 4.2 V ($\\sim\\!$ 3.1 kV).\n\n", "2305.08695": "2023-05-15, **Exploring the Focusing Mechanism of the NuMI Horn Magnets**, Katsuya Yonehara et.al., [2305.08695v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08695v1)\n\n Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) is a project at Fermilab that provides an intense beam of neutrinos used by a number of experiments. NuMI creates a beam of pions that decay into neutrinos, muons, and other particles. Muons are registered by the muon monitors. Magnetic horns are the key elements of the NuMI beam line. This paper uses the muon beam profile observed at the muon monitors to study the NuMI horn focusing mechanism. It is found that the horn magnet generates dipole and quadrupole fields to focus pions. This suggests that the optics of the horn magnet are predominantly linear. Our study shows that the muon beam profile accurately detects the horn current within 0.05%.\n\n", "2305.08665": "2023-05-15, **First Physics Results from the FASER Experiment**, Brian Petersen et.al., [2305.08665v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08665v1)\n\n FASER is a new LHC experiment designed to search for light, weakly-interacting particles that are produced in proton-proton collisions at the ATLAS interaction point and travel in the far-forward direction.

Modular symmetry reduces the usage of flavon fields compared to the conventional discrete flavor symmetry models. Theories based on modular symmetries predict the values of leptonic mixing parameters, and therefore, these models can be tested in future neutrino experiments. In this study, we consider three models based on the $A\\_4$ modular symmetry, i.e., Model-A, B, and C such a way that they predict different values of the oscillation parameters but still allowed with respect to the current data. In the future, it is expected that T2HK, DUNE, and JUNO will measure the neutrino oscillation parameters very precisely, and therefore, some of these models can be excluded in the future by these experiments. We have estimated the prediction of these models numerically and then used them as input to scrutinize these models in the neutrino experiments. Assuming the future best-fit values of $\\theta\\_{23}$ and $\\delta\\_{\\rm CP}$ remain the same as the current one, our results show that at $5 \\sigma$ C.L, Model-A can be excluded by T2HK whereas Model-B can be excluded by both T2HK and DUNE.

For this purpose, we consider the large amount of data available to the community via the web-page ``Quasielastic Electron Nucleus scattering archive'', and use a residual, fully connected feedforward neural network. We illustrate the training performances of the neural network by comparing its results with experimental data for the electron double-differential cross section on carbon. The agreement between predictions and data is remarkable from quasielastic to deep-inelastic scattering. To test the predicting power of the neural network we consider the numerous kinematical conditions for which experimental cross sections on calcium are available. Furthermore, we show the predictions of the electron scattering cross sections on oxygen, argon, and titanium: nuclei of particular interest in the context of present and future accelerator-based neutrino oscillation program. The agreement between these predictions and the data is comparable to the one of other theoretical models commonly used to calculate electron and neutrino cross sections, such as SuSAv2 and GiBUU. Results obtained with GENIE, a Monte Carlo event generator, are also discussed for comparison.

The model effectively suppresses the production of sterile neutrinos at low temperatures due to the heavy scalar mass, resulting in a colder matter power spectrum that avoids constraints from small-scale structure observations. In this model, the dominant dark matter relic is from sterile neutrinos, with only a small fraction originating from the ultralight scalar. Furthermore, the model predicts a detectable X/Gamma-ray flux proportional to the cubic density of local sterile neutrinos for a light scalar mass due to the light scalar coupling tosterile neutrinos. This distinguishes our model from normal decaying dark matter, which has a linear dependence on the density. In addition, the model predicts a potential low-energy monochromatic neutrino signal that can be detectable by future neutrino telescopes.\n\n", "2305.08083": "2023-05-14, **Unraveling the puzzle of slow components in two-phase argon detectors for dark matter searches using Thick Gas Electron Multiplier**, A. Buzulutskov et.al., [2305.08083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08083v1)\n\n The effect of proportional electroluminescence (EL) is used to record the primary ionization signal (S2) in the gas phase of two-phase argon detectors for dark matter particle (WIMP) searches and low-energy neutrino experiments. Our previous studies of EL time properties revealed the presence of two unusual slow components in S2 signal of two-phase argon detector, with time constants of about 4-5 $\\mu$s and 50 $\\mu$s. The puzzle of slow components is that their time constants and contributions to the overall signal increase with electric field (starting from a certain threshold), which cannot be explained by any of the known mechanisms of photon and electron emission in two-phase media. There are indications that these slow components result from delayed electrons, temporarily trapped during their drift in the EL gap on metastable negative argon ions of yet unknown nature. In this work, this hypothesis is convincingly confirmed by studying the time properties of electroluminescence in a Thick Gas Electron Multiplier (THGEM) coupled to the EL gap of two-phase argon detector. In particular, an unusual slow component in EL signal, similar to that observed in the EL gap, was observed in THGEM itself. In addition, with the help of THGEM operated in electron multiplication mode, the slow component was observed directly in the charge signal, unambiguously confirming the effect of trapped electrons in S2 signal. These results will help to unravel the puzzle of slow components in two-phase argon detectors and thus to understand the background in low-mass WIMP searches.\n\n", "2305.08032": "2023-05-14, **Neutrino forces and experimental probes**, Xun-Jie Xu et.al., [2305.08032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08032v1)\n\n Neutrinos as almost massless particles could mediate long-range forces, known as neutrino forces.

In this model, leakage either occurs through a fully ionized gas distribution (ionization bounded) or additionally through channels cleared of gas by supernova explosions (ionization bounded + holes).

Since XRBs are powered by accretion onto a neutron star or a black hole from a companion/donor star these systems are promising progenitors of merging double compact objects (DCOs): black hole - black hole (BH-BH), black hole - neutron star (BH-NS), or neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) systems. The connection (i.e. XRBs evolving into DCOs) may provide some hints to the yet unanswered question: what is the origin of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA mergers? Available observations do not allow to determine what will be the final fate of the XRBs observed in M83. Yet, we can use evolutionary model of isolated binaries to reproduce the population of XRBs in M83 by matching model XRBs numbers/types/luminosities to observations. Knowing the detailed properties of M83 model XRBs (donor/accretor masses, their evolutionary ages and orbits) we follow their evolution to the death of donor stars to check whether any merging DCOs are formed. Although all merging DCOs in our isolated binary evolution model go through the XRB phase (defined as reaching X-ray luminosity from RLOF/wind accretion onto NS/BH above $10^{35}$ erg/s), only very few XRBs evolve to form merging (in Hubble time) DCOs. For M83 with its solar-like metallicity stars and continiuous star-formation we find that only $\\sim 1-2\\%$ of model XRBs evolve into merging DCOs depending on the adopted evolutionary physics.

We find a significant velocity separation between ions having different charge-to-mass ratios in the immediate shock downstream and demonstrate that in fast enough shocks ion-ion collisions can trigger fusion and fission events at a relatively large rate. Our analysis does not take into account potential kinetic effects, specifically, anomalous coupling through plasma microturbulence, that can significantly reduce the velocity spread downstream, below the activation energy for nuclear reactions. A rough estimate of the scale separation in RMS suggests that for shocks propagating in BNS merger ejecta, the anomalous coupling length may exceed the radiation length, allowing a considerable composition change behind the shock via inelastic collisions of $\\alpha$ particles with heavy elements at shock velocities $\\beta\\_u\\gtrsim0.2$.
