We propose a \"natural\" particle model, in which the dark matter serves as the inflaton in natural inflation, while decaying to high-energy particles at energies of $10^{9}-10^{13} \\, \\text{GeV}$ from the prediction of the inflation. A scalar field responsible to dilute the dark matter abundance revives the natural inflation. Since the dark matter must be a spin zero scalar, we study carefully the galactic dark matter 3-body decay into fermions and two body decays into a gluon pair, and point out relevant multi-messenger bounds that constrain these decay modes. Interestingly, the predicted energy scale may coincide with the AMATERASU event and/or the KM3NeT neutrino event, KM3-230213A. We also point out particle models with dark baryon to further alleviate $\\gamma$-ray bounds. This scenario yields several testable predictions for the UHECR observations, including the highest-energy neutrons that are unaffected by magnetic fields, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of spectral indices, $\\alpha\\_s\\gtrsim\\mathcal{O}(0.001)$, and the existence of light new colored particles that could be accessible at future collider experiments.

To be precise, we demonstrate in this work, that this method does not provide solutions of the associated Weyl (Dirac) equation, nor does it fulfill the boundary conditions imposed on the spinor eigenfunctions to ensure confinement of the particle to the domain of the billiard. We review in detail the wave equation, boundary conditions and quantization of NBs and derivation of relevant equations, to make the proof comprehensible for the general reader.

We consider both relativistic and non-relativistic monopoles and focus on two primary detection signatures: high-energy antiproton production and proton decay catalysis.

In our work, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to reconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion typically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of the dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of interest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses significant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on multiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single viewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy emitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second challenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and can only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces an overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal completely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions about the structures in the volume. We instead propose a methodology using a gravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous matter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the weights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward model to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements. We showcase our method on simulations, including realistic simulated measurements of dark matter distributions that mimic data from upcoming telescope surveys. Our results show that our method can not only outperform previous methods, but importantly is also able to recover potentially surprising dark matter structures.\n\n", "2504.15116": "2025-04-21, **Wigner multiplets in QFT: from Wigner degeneracy to Elko fields**, Cheng-Yang Lee et.al., [2504.15116v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15116v1)\n\n We establish the theoretical foundation of the Wigner superposition field, a quantum field framework for spin-1/2 fermions that exhibit a Wigner doublet -- a discrete quantum number arising from nontrivial representations of the extended Poincar\\'{e} group. In contrast to the previously developed doublet formalism, which treats the Wigner degeneracy as a superficial label, the superposition formalism encodes it directly into the structure of a unified field via a coherent superposition of degenerate spinor fields. By imposing the Lorentz covariance, causality, and canonical quantization, we derive nontrivial constraints on the field configuration, which uniquely identify the Elko field as the consistent realization of the Wigner superposition field. Our analysis further clarifies that although the Elko field is a spinor field, it possesses mass dimension one and obeys the Klein-Gordon rather than the Dirac kinematics. Moreover, we explore the general Elko representation through basis redefinitions, showing that certain traditional properties, such as being eigenspinors of charge conjugation, are artifacts of specific basis choices rather than intrinsic features. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of Elko as a dark matter (DM) candidate. This work lays the foundation for a systematic reformulation of Elko interactions and its phenomenology as a viable component of DM.\n\n", "2504.14980": "2025-04-21, **Bayesian model selection of Primordial Black Holes and Dressed Primordial Black Holes with lensed Gravitational Waves**, Xin-yi Lin et.al., [2504.14980v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14980v1)\n\n If particle dark matter (DM) and primordial black holes (PBHs) coexist, PBHs will be surrounded by particle DM, forming celestial objects known as dressed PBHs (dPBHs). These structures suggest a scenario in which PBHs and DM can exist simultaneously. However, in the high-frequency regime, the gravitational lensing effect of bare PBHs is similar to that of dPBHs. Ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are particularly sensitive to high-frequency GW signals. In this regime, the lensing effect of a point-mass lens with a mass in the range of $10^{-1} \\sim 10^2 M\\_{\\odot}$ becomes significant. In this work, we incorporate dPBH models with GW observations and employ Bayesian inference techniques to distinguish PBHs from dPBHs. Using the third-generation ground-based GW detectors, Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), as examples, we demonstrate that these detectors can effectively differentiate the lensing effects of dPBHs from those of PBHs across a broad frequency range. Furthermore, we find that with a larger black hole (BH) mass inside the surrounding particle DM, ET and CE can distinguish these two lensed models with even greater precision.\n\n", "2504.14944": "2025-04-21, **Haloscope Searching for Dark Photons at Q-band with a Novel Coupling Tuning Structure**, Yue Yin et.al., [2504.14944v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14944v1)\n\n Laboratory searching for dark matter is crucial for understanding several fundamental conundrums in physics and cosmology. Most cavity-based haloscope searches focus on the frequency range below 10 GHz, while the parameter space with higher frequency remains rarely explored, due to the challenges lying in the fabrication of microwave cavities. Here we report the first Q-band haloscope searching for dark photons with a 33.141 GHz cavity. A novel coupling tuning structure separated from the cavity was designed so as not to degrade the quality factor of the cavity. We have established the most stringent constraints $\\chi<2.5\\times10^{-12}$ at a confidence level of 90$\\%$ in the frequency range from 33.139 GHz to 33.143 GHz, corresponding to the mass of dark photons ranging from 137.05 $\\mu$eV to 137.07 $\\mu$eV. The results surpass the previous astronomical constraints by nearly three orders of magnitude. This work has demonstrated the feasibility of dark matter haloscopes at Q band. In the future, the constraints can be further improved by more than one order of magnitude through low-temperature experiments, and the setup can be extended to search for axions, axion-like particles, and high-frequency gravitational waves.\n\n", "2504.14836": "2025-04-21, **Systematic search for blue hyper-velocity stars from LAMOST survey**, Yongkang Sun et.al., [2504.14836v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14836v1)\n\n Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) represent a unique class of objects capable of escaping the gravitational pull of the Milky Way due to extreme acceleration events, such as close encounters with the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center (GC), supernova explosions in binary systems, or multi-body dynamical interactions.

Gradual accumulation of heavy, non-annihilating dark matter in neutron stars can lead to the formation of comparable-mass black holes, and non-detection of gravitational waves from mergers of such low-mass black holes can constrain such dark matter interactions with nucleons. These constraints, though dependent on the currently uncertain binary neutron star merger rate density, are significantly more stringent than those from direct detection experiments and provide some of the strongest limits on heavy, non-annihilating dark matter interactions. Additionally, dark matter with baryon number-violating interactions can induce excess heating in cold neutron stars and is thus significantly constrained by thermal observations of cold neutron stars.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2504.15274": "2025-04-21, **Is Dynamical Dark Energy Necessary? DESI BAO and Modified Recombination**, Seyed Hamidreza Mirpoorian et.al., [2504.15274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15274v1)\n\n Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) exhibit a mild-to-moderate tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) observations when interpreted within a flat $\\Lambda$CDM framework. This discrepancy has been cited as evidence for dynamical dark energy (DDE). Given the profound implications of DDE for fundamental physics, we explore whether the tension can instead be resolved by modifying the physics of recombination. We find that a phenomenological model of modified recombination can effectively reconcile the BAO and CMB datasets and, unlike DDE, also predicts a higher Hubble constant $H\\_0$, thereby partially alleviating the Hubble tension. A global fit to BAO, CMB, and calibrated SN data clearly favors modified recombination over DDE, suggesting that current claims of a DDE detection may be premature.\n\n", "2504.15222": "2025-04-21, **Did DESI DR2 truly reveal dynamical dark energy?**, Deng Wang et.al., [2504.15222v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15222v1)\n\n A fundamental question in cosmology is whether dark energy evolves over time, a topic that has gained prominence since the discovery of cosmic acceleration. Recently, the DESI collaboration has reported increasing evidence for evolving dark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN), and their new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic due to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's claim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust. A more reliable approach involves constraining the evolution of dark energy using each dataset independently. Through a statistical comparison for each dataset, on average, we find that DDE is strongly preferred over the $\\Lambda$CDM model. This suggests that DDE likely exists, although its real parameter space remains elusive due to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state and inconsistencies among the datasets. Interestingly, when considering DDE, none of the individual datasets -- including CMB, DESI DR2, Pantheon+, Union3, and DESY5 -- can independently detect cosmic acceleration at a significant level. Our findings not only clarify the current understanding of the nature of dark energy but also challenge the established discovery of cosmic acceleration and the long-held notion that dark energy exerts negative pressure. Both individual and combined datasets suggest that the ultimate fate of the universe is likely to be dominated by matter rather than dark energy.\n\n", "2504.15127": "2025-04-21, **Reconstructing the redshift evolution of Type Ia supernovae absolute magnitude**, Rodrigo von Marttens et.al., [2504.15127v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15127v1)\n\n This work investigates a potential time dependence of the absolute magnitude of Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia). Employing the Gaussian Process approach, we obtain the SN Ia absolute magnitude and its derivative as a function of redshift. The data set considered in the analysis comprises measurements of apparent magnitude from SN Ia, Hubble rate from cosmic chronometers, and the ratio between angular and radial distances from Large-Scale Structure data (BAO and voids). Our findings reveal good compatibility between the reconstructed SN Ia absolute magnitudes and a constant value. However, the mean value obtained from the Gaussian Process reconstruction is $M=-19.456\\pm 0.059$, which is $3.2\\sigma$ apart from local measurements by Pantheon+SH0ES. This incompatibility may be directly associated to the $\\Lambda$CDM model and local data, as it does not appear in either model-dependent or model-independent estimates of the absolute magnitude based on early universe data. Furthermore, we assess the implications of a variable $M$ within the context of modified gravity theories.
