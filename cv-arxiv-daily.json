Chebat et.al., [2507.12401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12401v1)\n\n We derive constraints on the neutrino mass using a variety of recent cosmological datasets, including DESI BAO, the full-shape analysis of the DESI matter power spectrum and the one-dimensional power spectrum of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest (P1D) from eBOSS quasars as well as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The constraints are obtained in the frequentist formalism by constructing profile likelihoods and applying the Feldman-Cousins prescription to compute confidence intervals. This method avoids potential prior and volume effects that may arise in a comparable Bayesian analysis. Parabolic fits to the profiles allow one to distinguish changes in the upper limits from variations in the constraining power $\\sigma$ of the different data combinations. We find that all profiles in the $\\Lambda$CDM model are cut off by the $\\sum m\\_\\nu \\geq 0$ bound, meaning that the corresponding parabolas reach their minimum in the unphysical sector. The most stringent 95% C.L. upper limit is obtained by the combination of DESI DR2 BAO, Planck PR4 and CMB lensing at 53 meV, below the minimum of 59 meV set by the normal ordering. Extending $\\Lambda$CDM to non-zero curvature and $w\\_0w\\_\\mathrm{a}$CDM relaxes the constraints past 59 meV again, but only $w\\_0w\\_\\mathrm{a}$CDM exhibits profiles with a minimum at a positive value. Using a combination of DESI DR1 full-shape, BBN and eBOSS Lyman-$\\alpha$ P1D, we successfully constrain the neutrino mass independently of the CMB. This combination yields $\\sum m\\_\\nu \\leq 285$ meV (95% C.L.). The addition of DESI full-shape or Lyman-$\\alpha$ P1D to CMB and DESI BAO results in small but noticeable improvement of the constraining power of the data. Lyman-$\\alpha$ free-streaming measurements especially improve the constraint. Since they are based on eBOSS data, this sets a promising precedent for upcoming DESI data.\n\n", "2507.12335": "2025-07-16, **The impact of the transport of chemicals and electronic screening on helioseismic and neutrino observations in solar models**, Morgan Deal et.al., [2507.12335v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12335v1)\n\n The transport of chemical elements in stellar interiors is one of the greatest sources of uncertainties of solar and stellar modelling. The Sun, with its exquisite spectroscopic, helioseismic and neutrino observations, offers a prime environment to test the prescriptions used for both microscopic and macroscopic transport processes. We study in detail the impact of various formalisms for atomic diffusion on helioseismic constraints in both CLES (Scuflaire et al., 2008a) and Cesam2k2 (Morel and Lebreton 2008; Marques et al. 2013; Deal et al. 2018) models and compare both codes in detail. Moreover, due to the inability of standard models using microscopic diffusion to reproduce light element depletion in the Sun (Li, Be), another efficient process must be included to reproduce these constraints (rotation-induced: Eggenberger et al. 2022, overshooting -- or penetrative convection -- below the convective envelope: Th\\'evenin et al. 2017, or ad hoc turbulence: Lebreton and Maeder 1987; Richer, Michaud, and Turcotte 2000). However, introducing such an extra mixing leads to issues with the CNO neutrino fluxes (see Buldgen et al. 2023), which seem to be systematically lower than the Borexino observations (Appel et al., 2022. Another key aspect to consider when reconciling models with neutrino fluxes is the impact of electronic screening (Mussack and D\\\"appen, 2011).\n\n", "2507.12316": "2025-07-16, **Search for Quantum Decoherence with 10.7 years of atmospheric $\u03bd_\u03bc$ events in IceCube**, Tanvi Krishnan et.al., [2507.12316v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12316v1)\n\n In order to develop a consistent quantum theory of gravity, we must understand the nature of spacetime at the Planck scale. In particular if it exhibits quantum fluctuations, they may cause propagating particles to evolve in an apparently non-unitary manner. Neutrinos, which interact only via the weak force and gravity, maintain quantum coherence while propagating over large distances. Thus, neutrino oscillations serve as a precise interferometer to search for Planck-scale fluctuations of spacetime. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the world's largest neutrino telescope, located in the Antarctic icecap. We search the data on atmospheric neutrinos detected by IceCube in the energy range 0.5-100 TeV to test for neutrino decoherence.

We recently proposed that both could be explained by deep inelastic scatterings between sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around blazars and protons within their jets. Here, we compute the proton-recoil signals at the neutrino detectors Super-Kamiokande, KamLAND, Borexino, JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE induced by DM that is itself boosted by the scatterings with protons in blazar jets. We do it for the four cases of vector, axial, scalar and pseudoscalar mediators of DM-quark interactions. We perform the analysis for the single blazar TXS 0506+056 and for a sample of more than 300 stacked blazars. We find that searches for such blazar-boosted DM leave room for a variety of DM models to explain observations of high-energy neutrinos. We check that the depletion of the DM spike induced by DM-proton and DM-DM interactions does not compromise the DM interpretation for high-energy neutrinos, but challenges other blazar-DM signals.\n\n", "2507.12270": "2025-07-16, **No Hiding in the Dark: Cosmological Bounds on Heavy Neutral Leptons with Dark Decay Channels**, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., [2507.12270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12270v1)\n\n Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are well-motivated new physics candidates. The mixing of sub-GeV HNLs with active neutrinos is severely constrained by cosmology. In particular, the success of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) requires the HNL lifetime to be shorter than about 0.02 sec if they were in thermal equilibrium, thus excluding a wide range of mixing angles accessible to terrestrial experiments. In order to justify the laboratory searches in this cosmologically-forbidden region, it is often argued that adding new dark sector decay modes of HNLs can evade the stringent BBN constraint. Here we rule out this possibility and show that, contrary to the naive expectation, HNLs with significant dark decay modes actually lead to stronger cosmological bounds. This is mainly because of the increase in the extra radiation energy density in the Universe around the BBN epoch, which causes observable effects in the primordial helium fraction and $\\Delta N\\_{\\rm eff}$. Our result has major implications for laboratory searches of HNLs.\n\n", "2507.12074": "2025-07-16, **Testing the influence of anisotropic CR transport and the Galactic magnetic field structure on the all-sky gamma-ray emission**, Julien D\u00f6rner et.al., [2507.12074v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12074v1)\n\n The spatial diffusion of energetic particles in a magnetic field composed of a large-scale background and a small-scale turbulent component should be expected to be anisotropic. While such anisotropic diffusion has been known for quite a while in first-principle plasma physics and while it is required for an understanding of the transport of cosmic rays in the heliosphere or close to supernova remnants, only in recent years it has also become of particular interest for the modeling of Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) transport in the Milky Way in the context of their residence time and their (local) energy spectra. Also, the large-scale spatial distribution of GCRs is shaped by an anisotropic diffusion in the Galactic magnetic field, which should directly affect both the diffuse gamma-ray and the neutrino emission.   We solve the anisotropic diffusive transport of GCRs in the Milky Way using the publicly available transport code CRPropa. The anisotropy of the diffusion is characterized by the ratio between the diffusion coefficient perpendicular and parallel to the local magnetic field $\\epsilon = D\\_\\perp / D\\_\\parallel$, where we test different values reaching from nearly parallel transport ($\\epsilon = 10^{-3}$) to more isotropic diffusion ($\\epsilon = 10^{-1}$).

Its secure confirmation would mark a major advance in high-energy astrophysics. We perform a self-consistent multimessenger transport calculation of protons and their secondary $\\gamma$-rays and neutrinos from cosmologically evolving sources, confronting predictions with data from the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube, KM3NeT, and the Fermi-LAT isotropic $\\gamma$-ray background. A steep sub-ankle proton component saturates the diffuse $\\gamma$-ray background and is disfavoured, whereas a hard proton spectrum extending beyond $10^{20}$~eV with evolution $\\propto (1+z)^3$ reproduces KM3-230213A without violating any limits.

In the neutrino sector, while the neutrino mass is generated at one-loop level, the Ising fusion rule plays a role in stabilizing the particles inside the loop. As a result, the symmetry works like a $Z\\_2$ symmetry that is not broken at any loop order. Subsequently, we discuss the lepton flavor violating processes, muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment, and relic density of dark matter, where we specify our dark matter candidate to be a singlet boson and briefly analyze the relic density by estimating the DM annihilation cross section.

To improve diffuse measurements above 10 PeV, we apply machine learning techniques to enhance atmospheric muon background rejection and directional reconstruction. We utilize a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to perform a classification task that distinguishes neutrinos from high-energy atmospheric muons. The method allows for the rejection of early hits from laterally spread, lower-energy muons in cosmic ray showers without relying on directional reconstruction as a prior. Additionally, a Transformer-based Neural Network is implemented for directional reconstruction. Unlike previous likelihood-based rapid reconstruction algorithms that assume a single muon track, this method makes no prior assumptions about event topology of the particle inside the detector. We demonstrate improved background rejection and reconstruction performance using machine learning techniques.

Barbuy et.al., [2507.11667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11667v1)\n\n We have previously studied several elements in 58 selected bulge spheroid stars, based on spectral lines in the H-band. We now derive the abundances of the less-studied elements phosphorus (P; Z=15), sulphur (S; Z=16), and potassium (K; Z=19). The abundances of P, S, and K in 58 bulge spheroid stars are compared both with the results of a previous analysis of the data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and with a few available studies of these elements. We derive the individual abundances through spectral synthesis, using the stellar physical parameters available for our sample from the DR17 release of the APOGEE project. We provide recommendations for the best lines to be used for the studied elements among those in the H-band. We also compare the present results, together with literature data, with chemical-evolution models. Finally, the neutrino-process was taken into account for the suitable fit to the odd-Z elements P and K. We confirm that the H-band has useful lines for the derivation of the elements P, S, and K in moderately metal-poor stars. The abundances, plotted together with literature results from high-resolution spectroscopy, indicate that: moderately enhanced phosphorus stars are found, reminiscent results obtained for thick disk and halo stars of metallicity [Fe/H]~-1.0. Therefore, for the first time, we identify this effect to occur in the old stars from the bulge spheroid. Sulphur is an alpha-element and behaves as such. Potassium and sulphur both exhibit some star-to-star scatter, but fit within the expectations from chemical evolution models.\n\n", "2507.11607": "2025-07-15, **Electromagnetic Dirac Cogenesis**, Debasish Borah et.al., [2507.11607v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11607v1)\n\n We propose a novel cogenesis mechanism by utilising the two-body decay of heavy vector-like fermions to dark matter (DM) $\\chi$ and right chiral part of light Dirac neutrino $\\nu\\_R$ via the electromagnetic dipole operator. This leads to generation of asymmetry in dark fermion $\\chi$ as well as $\\nu\\_R$ with the latter getting transferred to left-handed lepton doublets via Yukawa interactions with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. While lepton asymmetry is converted into baryon asymmetry of the Universe via electroweak sphalerons, the dark fermion asymmetry results in asymmetric dark matter.

The electron magnetic moment is the most precisely measured property of an elementary particle and the most precise SM prediction, setting up the most precise confrontation ever between experiment and theory. It enables the most precise test of quantum field theory, and of the fundamental CPT symmetry invariance of the SM with leptons. The stable electron is studied with quantum methods while the electron remains for months in its quantum ground and first excited states. The muon magnetic moment is one of the most precisely measured property of an unstable elementary particle. Although less precise measured than the electron, it provides greater sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model -- a powerful tool for testing the existence of new particles and forces. Because muons decay quickly, they must be studied as they orbit at nearly the speed of light in a large storage ring.

However, in weak interaction processes, only flavor states participate, and the propagation can be described by an off-diagonal mass matrix. In this work, we operate directly with the non-diagonal mass matrix and employ a quantum field theory approach to describe neutrino oscillations within the plane-wave approximation, circumventing the use of wave packets. Within this framework, numerical estimates for the amplitude of a local process involving lepton interactions via virtual neutrino exchange yield values of order $10^{-53}$.

If nearby transient sources of ultra-high-energy particles exist, we might expect correlated emission of neutrinos and photons, arriving in close temporal and spatial coincidence. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the South Pole, is sensitive to neutrinos from TeV to EeV energies, while the Pierre Auger Observatory, in Argentina, detects cosmic rays and has the capability of observing ultra-high-energy photons using surface and fluorescence detectors. The ultra-high-energy photon candidates reported by the Auger Collaboration, though consistent with cosmic ray backgrounds, provide a compelling opportunity to search for correlated neutrino-photon events. In this contribution, we present the framework to search for ultra-high-energy transients by combining multi-flavour neutrino data from IceCube with photon candidates from the Auger Detector from 2011 to 2017.

By coherently scattering with molecular energy levels, a massive neutrino can spontaneously ``decay\" into a lighter neutrino and an infrared signal photon, i.e., $\\nu^{}\\_{i} + M \\to \\nu^{}\\_{j} + \\gamma^{}\\_{\\rm S} + M$, where the molecular state $M$ remains unchanged after the scattering. Because the amplitudes of different radiants are matched in phase, the rate is coherently enhanced and proportional to the squared density of ambient dipoles. When the energy transfer from neutrinos coincides with the molecular energy-level difference, the fluorescence will be on resonance. We find that the event rate for $\\nu^{}\\_{i} \\to \\nu^{}\\_{j} + \\gamma^{}\\_{\\rm S}$ at the resonance peak through the magnetic dipole transition can reach $R \\sim 5~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ (or $10~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$) for Dirac (or Majorana) neutrinos for a nominal target with a spatial dimension of $l=3~{\\rm m}$.

The scalar field possesses a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation, so that its interaction with the axion effectively serves as an explicit Peccei-Quinn (PQ) violating term. At a temperature below the PQ phase transition, the effective PQ violating interaction generates the axion potential which generally contains multiple degenerate vacua leading to the formation of the axion string-domain wall networks. The following QCD phase transition provides another contribution to the axion potential making domain walls decay before they dominate the Universe. Later, the scalar field starts to relax to the minimum of its potential with a vanishing VEV, turning off the effective PQ violating interaction so that the axion potential is aligned with the QCD vacuum. We keep track of the evolution of the axion-scalar system and discuss the production of the axion DM through the domain wall decay and the (trapped) misalignment. We find that the string-wall network in some cases can decay due to its structural instability, rather than the volume pressure, and the correct axion DM abundance is realized with the decay constant larger than that of the conventional post-inflationary QCD axion without fine tuning.\n\n", "2507.12227": "2025-07-16, **Dark Matter Clumps as Sources of Gravitational-Wave Glitches in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA data**, Ezequiel Alvarez et.al., [2507.12227v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12227v1)\n\n We consider the hypothetical possibility that non-stationary glitch features in the noise of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors could be produced by small dark matter clumps that pass through the earth in the vicinity of gravitational-wave detectors. We first derive the gravitational-wave strain that would be generated by the passage of such a dark matter clump. We find that the strain is primarily sourced by the Newtonian gravitational acceleration of the mirrors toward the clump and by the Shapiro time delay of the photons in the laser beams as they pass through the gravitational potential created by the dark matter clump. We also find that the Newtonian acceleration effect dominates the gravitational-wave strain for both ground and space-based interferometers. We then compare our dark matter clump, gravitational-wave strain model to 84 Koi-Fish glitches detected during the second observing run of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian analysis. We find that all glitches but 9 can be confidently rejected as having originated from dark matter clumps.

While related questions have been raised previously in specific contexts, here we focus on the Bianchi IX cosmological model, motivated by its relevance to early-universe dynamics through the BKL conjecture and its potential role in generating angular momentum via global rotation. We study the Dirac spinor field in this background and derive the corresponding Dirac equation.

We validated the two sets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point correlation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is consistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although we noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k>0.2 h/Mpc.

In the years that followed, the dark matter hypothesis as an explanation for dark matter phenomenology attracted far more attention compared to the hypothesis of modified gravity, and the latter is largely regarded today as a non-viable alternative. The present article takes an integrated history and philosophy of science approach in order to identify the reasons why the scientific community mainly pursued the dark matter hypothesis in the years that followed, as opposed to modified gravity. A plausible answer is given in terms of three epistemic criteria for the pursuitworthiness of a hypothesis: (a) its problem-solving potential, (b) its compatibility with established theories and the feasibility of incorporation, and (c) its independent testability. A further comparison between the problem of dark matter and the problem of dark energy is also presented, explaining why in the latter case the situation is different, and modified gravity is still considered a viable possibility.\n\n", "2507.11524": "2025-07-15, **Quantum modified inertia: an application to galaxy rotation curves**, Jonathan Gillot et.al., [2507.11524v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11524v1)\n\n This study explores the field of modified inertia through a novel model involving maximal and minimal acceleration bounds. A principle of dynamics is developed within special relativity and has direct implications in astrophysics, especially for galaxy rotation curves. The presence of a minimal acceleration significantly reduces the amount of dark matter required to account for these curves. The model presented here is however conceptually different from fiduciary Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). The modified inertia with the minimal acceleration bound closely matches with many observed galaxy rotation curves and the radial acceleration relation, showing a better agreement than MOND in the $10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ regime.

However, using redshifts as distance proxies introduces distortions in the 3D galaxy distribution. If uncorrected, these distortions lead to systematic errors in LSS analyses and cosmological parameter estimation. We present a new method that combines linear theory (LT) and a neural network (NN) to mitigate redshift space distortions (RSDs). The hybrid LT+NN approach is trained and validated on dark matter halo fields from z = 1 snapshots of the Quijote N-body simulations. LT corrects large-scale distortions in the linear regime, while the NN learns quasi-linear and small-scale features. The LT correction is applied first, then the NN is trained on the resulting fields to improve accuracy across scales. The method uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and yields significant performance gains: approximately 50% improvement over LT alone and 12% over NN alone. The reconstructed fields from the LT+NN method show stronger correlations with the true real-space fields than either LT or NN separately. The hybrid method also improves clustering statistics such as halo-halo and halo-void correlations, with benefits extending to BAO scales. Compared to NN-only, it provides better suppression of spurious anisotropies on large and quasi-linear scales, as measured by the quadrupole moments of correlation functions. This work shows that combining a physically motivated dynamical model with a machine learning algorithm leverages the strengths of both approaches. The LT+NN method achieves high accuracy with modest training data and computational cost, making it a promising tool for future applications to more realistic galaxy surveys.\n\n", "2507.11376": "2025-07-15, **GeV-scale thermal dark matter from dark photons: tightly constrained, yet allowed**, D. Alonso-Gonz\u00e1lez et.al., [2507.11376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11376v1)\n\n GeV-scale thermal dark matter (DM) is highly constrained by the null results of both direct and indirect detection experiments, especially in the context of simplified models. In this work, we study the interplay of collider, direct and indirect detection constraints on an extension of the dark Abelian Higgs model that includes a Dirac fermionic DM candidate, $\\chi$. We take into account in a consistent fashion the dilution of the indirect and direct detection signals when the relic abundance of $\\chi$ is smaller than the total observed DM density (assuming that it is a subdominant component in those cases). As a consequence, we show that indirect detection constraints cannot probe regions with large kinetic mixing, and direct detection experiments provide the leading constraints in most of the parameter space. Collider searches for the (invisibly decaying) vector mediator provide complementary bounds in areas with large kinetic mixing. We find that the only way to avoid both indirect and direct detection limits is in narrow windows of parameter space close to $m\\_\\chi\\lesssim m\\_{Z\\_D}/2$, when $\\chi$ is produced resonantly in the early universe, and it can constitute all of the DM.

Bandiera et.al., [2507.11332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11332v1)\n\n Progress in high-energy physics has been closely tied to the development of highperformance electromagnetic calorimeters. Recent experiments have demonstrated the possibility to significantly accelerate the development of electromagnetic showers inside scintillating crystals typically used in homogeneous calorimeters based on scintillating crystals when the incident beam is aligned with a crystallographic axis to within a few mrad. In particular, a reduction of the radiation length has been measured when ultrarelativistic electron and photon beams were incident on a high-Z scintillator crystal along one of its main axes. Here, we propose the possibility to exploit this physical effect for the design of a new type of compact e.m. calorimeter, based on oriented ultrafast lead tungstate (PWO-UF) crystals, with a significant reduction in the depth needed to contain electromagnetic showers produced by high-energy particles with respect to the state-of-the-art. We report results from tests of the crystallographic quality of PWO-UF samples via high-resolution X-ray diffraction and photoelastic analysis. We then describe a proof-of-concept calorimeter geometry defined with a Geant4 model including the shower development in oriented crystals. Finally, we discuss the experimental techniques needed for the realization of a matrix of scintillator crystals oriented along a specific crystallographic direction. Since the angular acceptance for e.m. shower acceleration depends little on the particle energy, while the decrease of the shower length remains pronounced at very high energy, an oriented crystal calorimeter will open the way for applications at the maximum energies achievable in current and future experiments.

The main conclusion of this work is that the performance of the infrared detectors Euclid meets the requirements. Pixels classified as non-functioning accounted for less than 0.2% of all science pixels. IPC coupling is minimal and crosstalk between adjacent pixels is less than 1% between adjacent pixels. 95% of the pixels show a QE greater than 80% across the entire spectral range of the Euclid mission.

We first present a modified metric, which incorporates the effects of a CDM ...   We compute the fundamental oscillation frequencies-radial, latitudinal, Keplerian, and Larmor-and demonstrate how their variation depends on the combined influence of CDM and magnetic field strength.

The suppression of the amplifier's technical fluctuations significantly improves the contrast of the thermal noise peaks exhibited by the resonators. Thus, for the room-temperature-stabilized 9 GHz sapphire-loaded cavity resonator, we observed more than 16 dB improvement in the thermal noise peak contrast relative to the single-channel measurements.

One of the crucial factors for discovering signatures from the Q-ball dark matter, is the interactions of the Q-ball dark matter with ordinary matter. In particular, the scattering of ordinary matter off the Q-ball dark matter is important for the direct detection searches, such as paleo-detectors. It was conjectured that quarks incident on the Q-ball were reflected as anti-quarks with a probability of order unity, but it costs the energy of the squark in the Q-ball, which cannot be paid in the scattering of ordinary matter off the Q-ball dark matter. In addition, once a proton is reflected as an anti-proton, the Q-ball obtains the electromagnetic charge.

Detailed study of more such systems is vital to understand common processes involved in the formation of this rare class of binaries and give insights towards the broader picture of WD spectral evolution.\n\n", "2507.11609": "2025-07-15, **Stephenson 2 DFK 52: Discovery of an exotic red supergiant in the massive stellar cluster RSGC2**, Mark A. Siebert et.al., [2507.11609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11609v1)\n\n Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations at 1.3mm have recently revealed surprising complexity in the circumstellar environment of DFK 52, a red supergiant (RSG) located in the Stephenson 2 massive open cluster. We provide an initial characterisation of the star's mass-loss properties by studying its circumstellar emission in continuum, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and SiO rotational lines. We find that DFK 52 is surrounded by an extremely large outflow (up to 50,000 au in radius) that shows complex morphologies in both its molecular and dust emission. The size of the circumstellar medium is unprecedented, even when compared with other known extreme RSGs, and its lower luminosity indicates that its mass ejection mechanism may be unique among this population. The molecular emission can be partially reproduced by a two-component model consisting of a fast (27 km/s) detached equatorial component with $M{\\sim}0.05$ $M\\_{\\odot}$ and a slow (10 km/s) spherical envelope with $\\dot{M}\\sim3\\times10^{-6}$ $M\\_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This suggests that DFK 52 underwent a dramatic mass-loss event $\\sim$4000 years ago, but has since transitioned into having a slower more symmetric mass loss. We conservatively estimate a total mass of $0.1-1$ $M\\_{\\odot}$ in the complex extended regions of the outflow. The uncertain nature of the dramatic mass loss warrants extensive follow-up of this likely supernova progenitor.\n\n", "2507.11602": "2025-07-15, **Unmixed metals: Variations in the enrichment of z~4 sub-damped Lyman alpha systems**, Trystyn A. M. Berg et.al., [2507.11602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11602v1)\n\n The chemical abundance patterns of near-pristine objects provide important constraints on the properties of the first generations of stars in the Universe. We present the chemical abundances of five very metal-poor ([M/H]<-2.5) sub damped Lyman alpha systems (subDLAs) covering the redshift range $3.6<z<4.3$, identified with the XQ-100 survey. We find that the subDLAs in our sample show consistent chemical abundance patterns (in particular [C/O], [Al/O], and [Fe/O]) with those of very metal-poor DLAs. Based on Voigt profile fitting, the chemical abundance ratios [C/O], [Al/O], and [Si/O] of individual velocity components in at least three of the subDLAs shows some intrinsic scatter. In order to verify these chemical inhomogeneities in absorption components, we present a novel method for computing ionization corrections (ICs) on a component-by-component basis and show that ICs alone cannot explain the variations in [C/O], [Al/O], and [Si/O] between components of the same absorber at ~2 sigma significance. Comparing the observed abundance ratios to the simulated core-collapse supernovae yields of early stellar populations, we find that all individual components of the subDLAs appears to be enriched by progenitor masses of <30 M\\_sol. The observed inhomogeneities between components can be reproduced by differences in the progenitor mass or supernova explosion energy. As such, the observed chemical inhomogeneities between components can be explained by poorly mixed gas from different nucleosynthetic events.\n\n", "2507.11518": "2025-07-15, **Revisiting Cosmic Distance Duality with Megamasers and DESI DR2: Model Independent Constraints on Early-Late Calibration**, Brijesh Kanodia et.al., [2507.11518v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11518v1)\n\n The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) connects the angular diameter distance ($d\\_A$) and the luminosity distance ($d\\_L$) at a given redshift. This fundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that photon number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A deviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low redshifts ($z < 0.04$) by combining $d\\_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project with $d\\_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). We find the relation to be statistically consistent with the current data. We further incorporate high-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)-based $d\\_A$ measurements from DESI DR2 in combination with SNIa data, highlighting the critical role of the $r\\_d-M\\_b$ (early-late) calibration in testing the CDDR using these two probes. Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to derive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only BAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r\\_d$ and $M\\_b$. However, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this degeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific cosmological model or distance-ladder techniques. Additionally, we present a forecast incorporating the expected precision from future Megamaser and SNIa observations, demonstrating their potential to significantly tighten constraints on early-late calibration parameters, under the assumption of validity of CDDR.\n\n", "2507.11432": "2025-07-15, **The Shape of Dark Energy: Constraining Its Evolution with a General Parametrization**, Dong Ha Lee et.al., [2507.11432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11432v1)\n\n We consider a general dark energy (DE) model parametrized by its equation-of-state (EoS), featuring three free parameters: $w\\_0$ (the present-day value of the DE EoS), $w\\_{\\beta}$ (quantifying the dynamical nature of the DE EoS), and $\\beta$ (governing various dynamical forms of the DE EoS). The key controlling parameter $\\beta$ can recover several existing DE models in the literature, such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization ($\\beta = 1$), the logarithmic parametrization (in the limit $\\beta \\rightarrow 0$), and the linear parametrization ($\\beta = -1$), alongside generate a class of new DE parametrizations for other values of $\\beta$. The resulting DE scenario is constrained using a suite of the latest cosmological probes, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies from three different experiments (Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope combined with WMAP), CMB lensing, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI Year 2, and PantheonPlus from Type Ia supernovae. Our analyses reveal that stringent constraints on the DE parameters are obtained only when all cosmological probes are combined; otherwise, some parameters remain unconstrained. The present-day value of the DE EoS remains in the quintessence regime according to our results, and no significant evidence for a dynamical DE EoS is found. However, based on the $\\Delta\\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence analyses, we observe a mild preference for the present three-parameter DE parametrization over the CPL parametrization when all cosmological probes are taken into account. Nonetheless, the Bayesian evidence difference remains below the threshold for statistical significance according to the revised Jeffreys scale, indicating that both models are effectively equally preferred by the data.\n\n", "2507.11286": "2025-07-15, **Transition radiation in dusty novae with non-thermal radio emission**, A.

The electrons that produce synchrotron radiation may interact with the dust in circumstellar environments, leading to the emission of transition radiation. We explore the production of transition radiation in dusty novae that also display synchrotron radiation emission. Transition radiation is emitted in the hard ultra-violet/X-ray range. We suggest that, even when the transition radiation is not itself directly observable, it may have a role in determining the ionisation balance of, and grain heating in, nova ejecta. Furthermore, it may be important in other dusty environments (such as supernova remnants) with non-thermal radio emission.\n\n", "2507.11237": "2025-07-15, **Testing Planck 2020 and DESI data on wCDM Models**, Kathleen Sammut et.al., [2507.11237v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11237v1)\n\n This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the tensions of {H\\_0} and {\\sigma\\_8} by using the latest observational data.

We analyze 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations of the supernova remnant Puppis A to investigate its asymmetric $\\gamma$-ray morphology and spectral properties. This middle-aged remnant ($\\sim$4 kyr) is evolving in an inhomogeneous environment, interacting with a dense molecular cloud in the northeast and a lower-density medium in the southwest. We find clear differences in both $\\gamma$-ray luminosity and spectral energy distribution between these two regions. The emission from both sides is consistent with a hadronic origin. However, while the southwestern emission can be explained by standard Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), the northeastern side may involve re-acceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays or acceleration via reflected shocks in the dense cloud environment. Additionally, we identify two significant $\\gamma$-ray excesses outside the remnant, including a previously unreported source to the south. These features are likely produced by cosmic rays that have escaped Puppis A and are interacting with nearby dense molecular material. From this extended emission, we estimate the total energy in escaping cosmic rays to be $W\\_{CR} \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{49}$ erg, providing important constraints on cosmic-ray propagation around the remnant.\n\n", "2507.11131": "2025-07-15, **A low mass, binary-stripped envelope for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo**, S. de Wet et.al., [2507.11131v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11131v1)\n\n Type IIb supernovae (SNe) are a transitional subclass of stripped-envelope SNe showing hydrogen lines in their spectra that gradually weaken and give way to helium lines reminiscent of SNe Ib, which is indicative of stripping through stellar winds or binary interaction. SN 2024abfo is the seventh SN IIb with a direct progenitor detection. We find that the position of the supernova in our ERIS adaptive optics imaging agrees with the progenitor position in archival HST imaging to within 19 mas. The progenitor SED is consistent with an A5 giant. Single star models predict an initial mass in the range 11 to 15 solar masses, while the most probable binary model is a 12+1.2 solar mass system with an initial period of 1.73 years. We also find significant evidence for variability of the progenitor candidate in the years prior to core-collapse. SN 2024abfo is the least luminous SN IIb with a direct progenitor detections. At late times the r-band light curve decays more slowly than the comparison SNe, which may be due to increased gamma-ray trapping. Similar to SN 2008ax, SN 2024abfo does not show a prominent double-peaked light curve. Our semi-analytic light curve modelling shows that this may be due to a very low mass of hydrogen in the outer envelope. Spectrally, SN 2024abfo is most similar to SN 2008ax at early times while at later times (80 days) it appears to show persistent Halpha absorption compared to the comparison sample. We prefer a binary system to explain the supernova and its progenitor, although we are unable to rule out single-star models. We recommend late-time observations to search for a binary companion and signatures of CSM-interaction. The absence of these features would support the hypothesis that SN 2024abfo resulted from a system which underwent a period of binary mass transfer well before (1000 yr) the explosion, resulting in a low-mass hydrogen-rich envelope.\n\n", "2507.10888": "2025-07-15, **Counter-Streaming Beams in Collisionless Pair Plasma Instability Systems I: Evolution and Parameterization of the Weibel Instability**, Michael C.
