Two promising source candidates have been identified by IceCube: NGC 1068 in the 1 TeV-10 TeV range and TXS 0506+056 in the 0.1-1 PeV range. Both sources have gamma-ray counterparts, but additional time information of both neutrinos and gamma rays were essential for the identification of TXS 0506+056. The Planetary Neutrino Monitoring (PLEnuM) concept is an approach for combining the exposures of all current and future neutrino observatories - such as KM3NeT, Baikal-GVD, P-ONE in the Northern Hemisphere, and IceCube-Gen2 in the Southern Hemisphere. Using this PLEnuM approach, we estimate how the detection capability for transient sources candidates like blazars and GRBs improves once the future neutrino observatories come online. In addition, we present how the combined, instantaneous field of view of PLEnuM improves the real-time detection rate of rare, very-high-energy neutrinos across the entire sky.\n\n", "2308.12742": "2023-08-24, **Extending the IceCube search for neutrino point sources in the Northern sky with additional years of data**, Chiara Bellenghi et.al., [2308.12742v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12742v1)\n\n The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a one-cubic-kilometer-sized neutrino telescope deployed deep in the Antarctic ice at the South Pole. One of IceCube's major goals is finding the origins of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos. In 2022, IceCube identified the strongest point-like neutrino source so far, the active galaxy NGC 1068. Analyzing 9 years of muon-neutrino data from the Northern Sky recorded between 2011 and 2020, the emission from NGC 1068 is significant at 4.2$\\,\\sigma$. We present a planned extension to this search with additional years of data. One of these years includes data from 2010 when IceCube was only partially constructed. We discuss the improvement in sensitivity and discovery potential for neutrino point sources across the Northern sky.

SkyLLH is an open-source, Python-based software tool to build these LLH functions and perform likelihood-ratio tests. We present a new easy-to-use and modular extension of SkyLLH that allows the user to perform neutrino point source searches in the entire sky using ten years of IceCube public data. To guide the user, SkyLLH provides tutorials showing how to analyze the experimental data and calculate useful statistical quantities. Here we describe the details of the analysis workflow and illustrate some of the possible methods to work with the IceCube public dataset. Additionally, we show that SkyLLH can reproduce the results from a previous IceCube publication that used the public data release. We obtain a similar local significance for the neutrino emission from a list of candidate sources within a maximum shift of 0.5$\\sigma$.

In fact, GRBs are known for their variable behaviour, and BATSE was already able to discover two categories of GRB from the T90 distribution; the short and long GRBs. These two categories match up with the expected two types of GRB progenitors. Nowadays, more features have been found to be able to further distinguish them, such as the hardness ratio or the presence of supernovae. However, that does not mean that it is by any means simple to categorise individual GRBs. Furthermore, more GRB categories have been theorised as well, such as low-luminosity or X-ray-rich GRBs. These different types of GRBs also could indicate a different neutrino spectrum, with different types of GRBs more likely to emit higher amounts of neutrinos. We present an ongoing effort to use machine learning to categorise and classify GRBs, searching for subpopulations that could yield a larger neutrino flux. We specifically use unsupervised learning, as it allows hidden patterns and correlations to come to light. With the help of features such as the T90, hardness, fluence, SNR, spectral index and even the full light curve and spectra, different structures and categories of Gamma-Ray bursts can be found.\n\n", "2308.12602": "2023-08-24, **The gamma-ray burst arising from neutrino pair annihilation in the static and spherically symmetric black-hole-like wormholes**, Yuxuan Shi et.al., [2308.12602v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12602v1)\n\n We look into the neutrino-antineutrino pair ($\\nu+\\bar{\\nu}\\longrightarrow e^{-}+e^{+}$) annihilation in the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole spacetime whose metric component involves a shift in contrast to the similar black hole. The deep analysis of the surface temperature of the accretion disk of static, spherically symmetric black-hole-like wormholes from R. Kh. Karimov et.al. reveals that the accretion disks of the wormholes are hotter than that of comparable black holes, indicating that the wormholes accretion disk can release neutrinos. Further we investigate the energy deposition rate from the neutrino pair annihilation around the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole thought as a mimicker of Schwarzschild black hole. By comparison made between the black-hole-like wormhole and the similar black hole, we demonstrate that the wormhole's accretion disk drawing the annihilation can become a source of gamma-ray burst although the more significant deviation from the similar black hole reduces the emitted power slightly. The ratio of energy deposition per unit time from the annihilation surrounding the accretion disk of the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole over the emitting power of black hole might alter noticeably depending on how slightly the metrics of the wormhole differ from the black hole spacetime.\n\n", "2308.12588": "2023-08-24, **Sterile Neutrino Portal Dark Matter from Semi-Production**, Ang Liu et.al., [2308.12588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12588v1)\n\n In this paper, we study the feeble sterile neutrino portal dark matter under the $Z\\_3$ symmetry.

Another appealing scenario is when the dark sector is initially produced through the scattering process as $NN\\to\\chi\\chi, NN\\to\\phi\\phi,h\\nu\\to\\chi\\phi$, then the semi-production processes $N \\chi\\to\\phi\\phi, N\\phi\\to\\phi\\chi, N\\chi\\to\\chi\\chi$ could lead to the exponential growth of dark sector abundances.

Dark matter (DM) interacting with electrons can get captured inside the Sun. These captured DM may annihilate to produce different Standard Model (SM) particles. Neutrinos produced from these SM states can be observed in IceCube and DeepCore. Although there is no excess of neutrinos from the Solar direction, we find that the current data-sets of IceCube and DeepCore set the strongest constraint on DM-electron scattering cross section in the DM mass range $10\\,$GeV to $10^5\\,$GeV.

In this proceeding, we will present a neutrino search with the data of this \"hybrid\" station, emphasizing its capabilities for improved analysis efficiencies, background rejection, and neutrino vertex reconstruction. This is enabled by combining the closely packed trigger antennas with the long-baselines of the outrigger antennas. We will also place the A5 analysis into the context of the broader five station analysis program, including efforts to characterize and calibrate the detector, model and constrain backgrounds, and reject noise across the entire array.

While these particles are expected to interact homogeneously in the entire detector volume, specific classes of external background radiation preferably deposit their energy close to the semi-active detector surface, in which diffusion processes dominate that subsequently lead to slower rising pulses compared to the ones from the fully active bulk volume. Dedicated studies of their shape are therefore highly beneficial for the understanding and the rejection of these unwanted events. This article reports about the development of a data-driven pulse shape discrimination (PSD) method for the four 1 kg size PPC HPGe detectors of the CONUS experiment in the keV and sub-keV regime down to 210 eV$\\_{\\text{ee}}$. The impact of the electronic noise at such low energies is carefully examined. It is shown that for an acceptance of 90% of the faster signal-like pulses from the bulk volume, approx. 50% of the surface events can be rejected at the energy threshold and that their contribution is fully suppressed above 800 eV$\\_{\\text{ee}}$. Applied to the CONUS background data, such a PSD rejection cut allows to achieve an overall (15-25)% reduction of the total background budget.

In this study, we analyze the influence of the intensity parameter of perfect fluid DM on the destruction of the event horizon of a Kerr-like black hole with spinning after injecting test particles and scalar fields. We find that, when test particles are incident on the black hole, the event horizon is destroyed by perfect fluid dark matter for extreme black holes. For nearly extreme black holes, when the dark matter parameter satisfies $\\alpha \\in \\left (-r\\_{h} , 0\\right ) \\cup \\left ( r\\_{h} ,+ \\infty \\right )$ i.e.$(A<0)$, the event horizon of the black hole will not be destroyed; when the dark matter parameter satisfies $\\alpha \\in\\left ( -\\infty ,-r\\_{h} \\right ]\\cup \\left[0,r\\_{h}\\right ]$ i.e.$(A\\ge 0)$, the event horizon of the black hole will be destroyed.

In the nearly extremal black hole case, through our analysis, we have found when $\\alpha\\neq0 $ and $\\alpha\\neq\\pm\\ r\\_h$ i.e.$A\\neq0$, the event horizon of the black hole can be disrupted.

With such a simple extension, it can be found several regions with interesting implications which cannot be realized in the usual restricted models. It is observed that the Yukawa unification solutions can be compatible with relatively light mass spectrum and acceptable low fine-tuning measurements. In the restricted models such effects can directly be addressed to the non-holomorphic terms. They can provide a slight improvement in the SM-like Higgs boson mass without altering the mass spectrum too much, and they can accommodate relatively lighter sbottom and stau masses, while they do not change the stop sector much. The dark matter can be Higgsino-like or Bino-like, but the experimental relic density measurements favor the Higgsino-like dark matter, while the Bino-like dark matter is predicted with a quite large relic density. Also several coannihilation scenarios are identified in the Higgsino-like dark matter regions, while the Bino-like dark matter do not allow any of such coannihilation processes. The presence of the non-holomorphic terms can weaken the impact from the phenomenological or indirect constraints such as low fine-tuning, Yukawa unification and rare decays of $B-$meson, the direct and model independent constraints still yield a strong strike on the solutions.

For ensuring gauge-invariant Yukawa interactions and the cancellation of gauge anomalies, the standard model fermions are assigned $Y$-sequential $\\mathrm{U}(1)\\_\\mathrm{X}$ charges proportional to the Higgs charge. Although the Higgs charge should be small due to collider constraints, it is useful to decrease the effective cross section of dark matter scattering off nucleons by two orders of magnitude and easier evade from direct detection bounds. After some numerical scans performed in the parameter space, we find that the introduction of the Higgs charge can also enhance the dark matter relic density by at least two orders of magnitude. When the observed relic density and the direct detection constraints are tangled, at the case where the resonance effect is important for dark matter freeze-out, the Higgs charge can expand physical windows to some extent by relieving the tension between the relic density and the direct detection.\n\n", "2308.12556": "2023-08-24, **Relic abundance of dark matter with coannihilation in non-standard cosmological scenarios**, Fangyu Liu et.al., [2308.12556v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12556v1)\n\n We investigate the relic abundance of dark matter from coannihilation in non-standard cosmological scenarios. We explore the effect of coannihilation on the relic density of dark matter and freeze out temperature in quintessence model with kination phase and brane world cosmological scenarios. Since the Hubble expansion rate is enhanced in quintessence and brane world cosmological models, it causes the larger relic density comparing to the standard one. On the other hand, the relic density of dark matter is decreased due to the coannihilation in the standard cosmological scenario. In quintessence or brane world cosmological scenarios, we find the decrease of the relic density of dark matter is slightly slower than that in the standard cosmological scenario.\n\n", "2308.12473": "2023-08-23, **High scale validity of two Higgs doublet scenarios with a real scalar singlet dark matter**, Subhaditya Bhattacharya et.al., [2308.12473v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12473v1)\n\n We study the high-scale validity of two kinds of two Higgs doublet models (2HDM), namely, Type-II and Type-X, but with a scalar SU(2) singlet dark matter (DM) candidate in addition in each case. The additional quartic couplings involving the DM particle in the scalar potential in both the scenarios bring in additional constraints from the requirement of perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability. DM relic density and direct search constraints play a crucial role in this analysis as the perturbative unitarity of the DM-Higgs portal couplings primarily decide the high scale validity of the model. We find that, within the parameter regions thus restricted, the Type-II scenario must have a cut-off at around $10^6$ GeV, while the Type-X scenario admits of validity upto the Planck scale. However, only those regions which are valid upto about $10^8$ GeV in Type-X 2HDM is amenable to detection at the High-luminosity LHC (upto 3000 $fb^{-1}$), while most of the parameter space of the Type-II scenario mentioned above is likely to be detectable.\n\n", "2308.12330": "2023-08-23, **Astrometric Weak Lensing with Gaia DR3 and Future Catalogs: Searches for Dark Matter Substructure**, Cristina Mondino et.al., [2308.12330v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12330v1)\n\n Small-scale dark matter structures lighter than a billion solar masses are an important probe of primordial density fluctuations and dark matter microphysics.

We study what effect bosonic dark matter, modelled as a massive and self-interacting scalar or vector field, has on neutron stars. We derive equations to compute the tidal deformability of the full Einstein-Hilbert-Klein-Gordon system self-consistently, and probe the influence of the scalar field mass and self-interaction strength on the total mass and tidal properties of the combined system, called fermion boson stars (FBS). We are the first to combine Proca stars with neutron stars to mixed systems of fermions and a vector field in Einstein-Proca theory, which we name fermion Proca stars (FPS). We construct equilibrium solutions of FPS, compute their masses, radii and analyse them regarding their stability and higher modes. We find that FPS tend to be more massive and geometrically larger than FBS for equal boson masses and self-interaction strengths. Both FBS and FPS admit DM core and DM cloud solutions and we find that they can produce degenerate results. Core solutions compactify the neutron star component and lower their tidal deformability, cloud solutions have the inverse effect. Electromagnetic observations of certain cloud-like configurations would appear to violate the Buchdahl limit.

In particular, if the energy scale of inflation is lower than the QCD scale, a hybrid inflation is realized where the QCD axion plays the role of the inflaton in early stages. We perform detailed numerical calculations to take account of the mixing effects. Interestingly, the initial misalignment angle of the QCD axion, which is usually a free parameter, is determined by the inflaton dynamics. It is found to be close to $\\pi$ in simple models.

Compared to normal SN Ia 2021aefx, SN 2022pul exhibits a lower mean ionization state, asymmetric emission-line profiles, stronger emission from the intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) argon and calcium, weaker emission from iron-group elements (IGEs), and the first unambiguous detection of neon in a SN Ia. Strong, broad, centrally peaked [Ne II] at 12.81 $\\mu$m was previously predicted as a hallmark of \"violent merger'' SN Ia models, where dynamical interaction between two sub-$M\\_{\\text{Ch}}$ white dwarfs (WDs) causes disruption of the lower mass WD and detonation of the other. The violent merger scenario was already a leading hypothesis for 03fg-like SNe Ia; in SN 2022pul it can explain the large-scale ejecta asymmetries seen between the IMEs and IGEs and the central location of narrow oxygen and broad neon. We modify extant models to add clumping of the central ejecta to better reproduce the optical iron emission, and add mass in the innermost region ($< 2000$ km s$^{-1}$) to account for the observed narrow [O I] $\\lambda\\lambda6300$, 6364 emission. A violent WD-WD merger explains many of the observations of SN 2022pul, and our results favor this model interpretation for the subclass of 03fg-like SN Ia.\n\n", "2308.12449": "2023-08-23, **Ground-based and JWST Observations of SN 2022pul: I. Unusual Signatures of Carbon, Oxygen, and Circumstellar Interaction in a Peculiar Type Ia Supernova**, Matthew R. Siebert et.al., [2308.12449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12449v1)\n\n Nebular-phase observations of peculiar Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide important constraints on progenitor scenarios and explosion dynamics for both these rare SNe and the more common, cosmologically useful SNe Ia. We present observations from an extensive ground-based and space-based follow-up campaign to characterize SN 2022pul, a \"super-Chandrasekhar\" mass SN Ia (alternatively \"03fg-like\" SN), from before peak brightness to well into the nebular phase across optical to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths. The early rise of the light curve is atypical, exhibiting two distinct components, consistent with SN Ia ejecta interacting with dense carbon-oxygen rich circumstellar material (CSM). In the optical, SN 2022pul is most similar to SN 2012dn, having a low estimated peak luminosity ($M\\_{B}=-18.9$ mag) and high photospheric velocity relative to other 03fg-like SNe. In the nebular phase, SN 2022pul adds to the increasing diversity of the 03fg-like subclass. From 168 to 336 days after peak $B$-band brightness, SN 2022pul exhibits asymmetric and narrow emission from [O I] $\\lambda\\lambda 6300,\\ 6364$ (${\\rm FWHM} \\approx 2{,}000$ km s$^{-1}$), strong, broad emission from [Ca II] $\\lambda\\lambda 7291,\\ 7323$ (${\\rm FWHM} \\approx 7{,}300$ km s$^{-1}$), and a rapid Fe III to Fe II ionization change. Finally, we present the first-ever optical-to-mid-infrared (MIR) nebular spectrum of an 03fg-like SN Ia using data from JWST. In the MIR, strong lines of neon and argon, weak emission from stable nickel, and strong thermal dust emission (with $T \\approx 500$ K), combined with prominent [O I] in the optical, suggest that SN 2022pul was produced by a white dwarf merger within carbon/oxygen-rich CSM.\n\n", "2308.12363": "2023-08-23, **Pre-supernova feedback sets the star cluster mass function to a power law and reduces the cluster formation efficiency**, Eric P. Andersson et.al., [2308.12363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12363v1)\n\n The star cluster initial mass function is observed to have an inverse power law exponent around 2, yet there is no consensus on what determines this distribution, and why some variation is observed in different galaxies. Furthermore, the cluster formation efficiency covers a range of values, particularly when considering different environments. These clusters are often used to empirically constrain star formation and as fundamental units for stellar feedback models. Detailed galaxy models must therefore accurately capture the basic properties of observed clusters to be considered predictive. We use hydrodynamical simulations of a dwarf galaxy as a laboratory to study star cluster formation. We test different combinations of stellar feedback mechanisms, including stellar winds, ionizing radiation, and supernovae. Each feedback mechanism affects the cluster formation efficiency and cluster mass function. Increasing the feedback budget by combining the different types of feedback decreases the cluster formation efficiency by reducing the number of massive clusters. Ionizing radiation is found to be especially influential. This effect depends on the timing of feedback initiation, as shown by comparing early and late feedback. Early feedback occurs from ionizing radiation and stellar winds with onset immediately after a massive star is formed. Late feedback occurs when energy injection only starts after the main-sequence lifetime of the most massive SN progenitor, a timing that is further influenced by the choice of the most massive SN progenitor. Late feedback alone results in a broad, flat mass function, approaching a log-normal shape in the complete absence of feedback. Early feedback, on the other hand, produces a power-law cluster mass function with lower formation efficiency, albeit with a steeper slope than that usually observed.\n\n", "2308.12345": "2023-08-23, **Probing Early Modification of Gravity with Planck, ACT and SPT**, Guillermo Franco Abell\u00e1n et.al., [2308.12345v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12345v1)\n\n We consider a model of early modified gravity (EMG) that was recently proposed as a candidate to resolve the Hubble tension. The model consists in a scalar field $\\sigma$ with a non-minimal coupling (NMC) to the Ricci curvature of the form $F(\\sigma) = M\\_{\\mathrm{pl}}^2+\\xi\\sigma^2$ and an effective mass induced by a quartic potential $V(\\sigma) = \\lambda \\sigma^4/4$. We present the first analyses of the EMG model in light of the latest ACT DR4 and SPT-3G data in combination with full Planck data, and find a $\\gtrsim 2\\sigma$ preference for a non-zero EMG contribution from a combination of primary CMB data alone, mostly driven by ACT DR4 data. This is different from popular 'Early Dark Energy' models, which are detected only when the high-$\\ell$ information from Planck temperature is removed. We find that the NMC plays a key role in controlling the evolution of density perturbations that is favored by the data over the minimally coupled case. Including measurements of supernovae luminosity distance from Pantheon+, baryonic acoustic oscillations and growth factor from BOSS, and CMB lensing of Planck leaves the preference unaffected. In the EMG model, the tension with S$H\\_0$ES is alleviated from $\\sim 6\\sigma$ to $\\sim 3\\sigma$. Further adding S$H\\_0$ES data rise the detection of the EMG model above $5\\sigma$.\n\n", "2308.11913": "2023-08-23, **Polarization Signature of Companion-Fed Supernovae Arising from BH-NS/BH Progenitor Systems**, Xudong Wen et.al., [2308.11913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11913v1)\n\n The formation of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) or BH-BH systems may be accompanied with special supernova (SN) signals, due to the accretion feedback from the companion BH. The additional heating, which is mainly attributed to the Blandford-Payne mechanism, would disrupt the isotropic nature of the luminosity distribution on the surface of the SN ejecta, leading to the appearance of polarization. Here we develop a three dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo polarization simulation code (MCPSC) to conduct simulations for these special SNe. We find that the maximum polarization level of approximately \\sim 2 occurs at the peak time of SN emission in the \"close-binary\" scenario, while in the \"faraway-binary\" case, maximum polarization (i.e. \\sim 0.7) is observed at a considerably later time than the peak of the SN. The magnitude of polarization is dependent on the degree of unevenness in the luminosity distribution and the angle between the line of sight and the equatorial direction. When considering the geometric distortion of supernova ejecta at the same time, the magnitude of polarization may either increase (for a oblate ellipsoidal shape) or decrease (for a prolate ellipsoidal shape). The polarization signatures represent a promising auxiliary instrument to facilitate the identification of the companion-fed SNe. Moreover, by comparing the event rate of these special SNe with the event rate density of LIGO-Virgo detected BH-NS/BH systems could further help to distinguish the BH-NS/BH formation channel.\n\n"}}
