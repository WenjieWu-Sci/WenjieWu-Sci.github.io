Recent advances in X-ray time-domain astronomy, together with the development of next-generation neutrino telescopes, open new opportunities for joint X-ray and neutrino observations of these transients. We calculate the jet dynamical evolution and the associated neutrino production for both non-magnetized and magnetized outflows. For individual events, joint X-ray and neutrino detection is generally limited to nearby LLGRBs or sources with high luminosities. Thus, we consider a next-generation neutrino telescope with an effective area enhanced by a factor of $\\sim30$ relative to IceCube. In the non-magnetized scenario, joint detection of individual events is enabled for sources with typical isotropic luminosities of $L\\_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\sim10^{47}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$ out to luminosity distances of $D\\_L\\sim1.6\\times10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $1$ per year. In contrast, for the magnetized scenario at the same luminosity, the accessible distance is significantly reduced, with joint observations confined to sources within $D\\_L\\sim6.5\\times10^{1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and an expected detection rate of order $0.5$ per year. For stacked samples of $\\sim100$ magnetized LLGRBs, stacking substantially enlarges the accessible distance range, enabling joint observations for sources with representative luminosities of $L\\_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\sim1\\times10^{47}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$ out to $D\\_L\\lesssim7.0\\times10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $2$ per year.

While upcoming oscillation experiments aim to resolve this problem at low energies, complementary approaches are highly desirable. In this Letter, we show that the neutrino mass ordering can be probed at high-energy colliders through the lepton-flavor structure of heavy neutral lepton (HNL) interactions. In the minimal Type-I seesaw scenario with two nearly degenerate HNLs, the heavy--light neutrino mixings are strongly correlated with the light-neutrino mass spectrum, leading to distinct flavor patterns for the normal and inverted hierarchies. We demonstrate that future $Z$ factories, such as CEPC and FCC-ee, can probe the neutrino mass ordering for total HNL mixings as small as $U\\_{\\rm tot}^2 \\gtrsim 4 \\times 10^{-9}$, and discriminate between the two hierarchies for $U\\_{\\rm tot}^2 \\gtrsim 10^{-6}$. Our results establish collider searches for HNLs as a powerful and complementary probe of the neutrino mass ordering.\n\n", "2601.10271": "2026-01-15, **Physics with next generation neutrino experiments: ESSnuSB**, ESSnuSB et.al., [2601.10271v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10271v1)\n\n In this proceedings we explore the physics potential of the ESSnuSBplus setup to study beam and non-beam based physics scenarios in both standard and new physics cases.

These quantities help maximize sensitivity to potential signals, distinguish between different decay modes and interpret the data. In this work we provide updated results for these kinematic factors for two-neutrino ($2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2$) and neutrinoless ($0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2$) decay modes, including electron-emission, positron-emission and electron capture transitions.

We provide tables with updated PSFs calculated both in the closure approximation and using the Taylor expansion method, for a large number of DBD isotopes. We discuss the impact of individual atomic corrections and find that our results are in line with predictions reported in recent literature.

However, the mass scale of the undiscovered right-handed neutrinos required by this mechanism remains undetermined. Assuming vanilla leptogenesis in the two-flavor regime, we work backwards to find the required general textures of the Dirac mass matrix from which we determine the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino to be around $10^9 {\\rm GeV}$ to $10^{12} {\\rm GeV}$.\n\n", "2601.09791": "2026-01-14, **Lessons from the first JUNO results**, Ivan Esteban et.al., [2601.09791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09791v1)\n\n First results from the JUNO reactor neutrino experiment already determine with world-leading precision the small neutrino squared-mass splitting $\u0394m^2\\_{21}$ and the mixing angle $\u03b8\\_{12}$. In this article we perform an exploratory study beyond these, taking advantage of the first JUNO data release to discuss its sensitivity to the large squared-mass splitting, $\u0394m^2\\_{3\\ell}$. When combined with constraints from global oscillation data, this may already contain some information on the neutrino mass ordering. Indeed, we find that the combination of the complementary $\u0394m^2\\_{3\\ell}$-determinations gives a slight preference for Normal Ordering, with a p-value for Inverted Ordering of 2%-2.6% ($2.2\u03c3$-$2.3\u03c3$). We study the robustness of this result with respect to potential systematic uncertainties and statistical fluctuations. Taken at face value, a full global analysis of oscillation data including the publicly available JUNO information and data leads to a preference for Normal Ordering with $\u0394\u03c7^2 = 4.6$ and 9.4 without and with Super-K and IceCube-24 atmospheric neutrino data, respectively.\n\n", "2601.09790": "2026-01-14, **The Cosmic Neutrino Background is within Reach of Future Neutrino Telescopes**, Gonzalo Herrera et.al., [2601.09790v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09790v1)\n\n The cosmic neutrino background (C$\u03bd$B) can be boosted to high energies due to scatterings with energetic cosmic rays (CRs) across cosmological scales. Previous calculations focused on neutral current incoherent and coherent elastic scatterings of cosmic-ray protons off relic neutrinos. However, charged current interactions and deep inelastic scatterings are also expected to occur, which enhances the boosted relic neutrino fluxes on Earth. Here, we compute the \\textit{total} diffuse boosted cosmic neutrino background (DBC$\u03bd$B) arising from CRs at all redshifts in the Universe, accounting for neutral current and charged current elastic and deep inelastic scatterings.

This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth $\u03c4$ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of $\u03c4$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x\\_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$\u03b1$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining $x\\_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$ with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain $\u03c4=0.0552^{+0.0019}\\_{-0.0026}$, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining $\u03c4=0.0552^{+0.0075}\\_{-0.0049}$. Using this constraint on $\u03c4$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $\u03c4$-$\u03a9\\_m$ plane and find a $2.4\u03c3$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $\u039b$CDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\u03a3m\\_\u03bd<0.0550\\,(0.0717)$ eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, $\u03a3m\\_\u03bd=0.0594\\_{-0.0007}^{+0.0113}$ eV.

Such models are highly predictive, with neutrino masses and the lepton mixing mixing matrix being fixed by three real parameters, as in the Littlest Seesaw Models. We perform an exhaustive scan over all possible models in this class and find many viable fixed points and modular form alignments, after confronting them with the latest neutrino oscillation global fits. The resulting models have the new feature that the two Dirac columns take more general forms than traditional Littlest Seesaw models, resulting in new sum rule relations between the solar and reactor angles, beyond those associated with TM1 (where the first column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix is preserved), which are compared to present and future projected JUNO results.

Realizing this picture is nonetheless challenging, since CMB observations tightly constrain energy injection from dark-matter annihilation at recombination and therefore strongly disfavor simple $s$-wave annihilation into visible Standard-Model final states. In this work, we propose a concrete neutrinophilic framework for sub-GeV thermal dark matter (''light WIMPs'') based on an additional gauge symmetry $\\mathrm{U}(1)\\_{\\mathrm{B}-\\mathrm{L}+x\\mathrm{Y}}$; for an appropriate choice of $x$, the new gauge boson couples predominantly to dark matter and neutrinos while its couplings to charged leptons are suppressed, so that sub-GeV dark matter annihilates almost exclusively into neutrinos, with hadronic modes kinematically closed. We map the parameter space in which the observed relic abundance is reproduced via standard thermal freeze-out in a conventional cosmological history, and show that sizable regions remain viable after imposing current cosmological, indirect-detection, and terrestrial constraints; in part of the allowed parameter space, the dark matter also exhibits sufficiently large self-interactions to potentially alleviate small-scale structure tensions.\n\n", "2601.09224": "2026-01-14, **Spontaneous Cogensis by QCD axion in Type I Seesaw**, Eung Jin Chun et.al., [2601.09224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09224v1)\n\n We propose a generic axion--driven cogenesis scenario in which both the baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance originate from the kinetic misalignment. The framework unifies the Peccei--Quinn (PQ) mechanism with a Type--I seesaw sector, where Hubble--induced masses and higher-dimensional PQ--violating operators drive early--time axion rotation. Working within the DFSZ axion model augmented by heavy neutrinos, we identify the parametric window of right-handed neutrino masses, determined by its decay rate, and the range of Hubble scales compatible with successful cogenesis, while maintaining the axion solution to the strong CP problem and satisfying current limits on axion isocurvature perturbations.

For heavy neutrino masses below $\\mathcal{O}(1~\\mathrm{TeV})$, production is dominated by the $s$ channel process. At higher masses, vector boson fusion becomes the dominant production mechanism, with cross sections that decrease slowly as the heavy neutrino mass increases. We simulate both signal and Standard Model background events and employ gradient-boosted decision trees to optimize event classification. Assuming an integrated luminosity of $3000~\\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$, expected for the high-luminosity, and considering realistic statistical and systematic uncertainties, we find that heavy neutrinos in the mass range $50~\\mathrm{GeV}$--$10~\\mathrm{TeV}$ can be probed with sensitivity to the mixing parameter $\\|V\\_{\\ell N}\\|^2$ spanning from $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ to 1.

Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2601.10121": "2026-01-15, **Direct Detection of Type II-P Supernova Progenitors with the Euclid and CSST Surveys**, Junjie Wu et.al., [2601.10121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10121v1)\n\n A central goal in supernova (SN) research is to identify and characterize their progenitors. However, this is very difficult due to the limited archival images with sufficient depth and spatial resolution required for direct progenitor detection and due to the circumstellar dust which often biases the estimate of their intrinsic parameters. This field will be revolutionized by Euclid and the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), which conduct deep, wide-field, high-resolution and multi-band imaging surveys. We analyze their detection capability by comparing the model magnitudes of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors with the detection limits under different conditions, and we estimate the annual detection rates with Monte-Carlo simulations. We explore how to recover the intrinsic properties of SN progenitors with the help of radiation transfer calculations in circumstellar dust. We find the optical and near-infrared filters of the Euclid and CSST are highly effective for detecting RSG progenitors. We predict that archival images from the completed 2 surveys will enable $\\lesssim13$ (or 24) progenitor detections per year within the mass range of 8--16 (or 8--25)M\\_\\odot, an order of magnitude higher than the current detection rate of $\\sim1$ detection per year.

Our mock tests demonstrate that one can derive the progenitor mass and dust optical depth simultaneously by fitting the observed SED over the 11 filters of the 2 surveys while fixing the dust temperature to a typical value.

We combined the new X-ray data with the multiwavelength observations in radio, GeV, and TeV gamma rays and modeled the SED, applying a one-zone and a multi-zone leptonic model.

If the NS injects an amount of energy comparable to the explosion energy of the accompanying supernova (SN) before the SN ejecta becomes transparent, the nascent NS wind bubble can overtake the outer ejecta and undergo a blowout driven by hydrodynamic instabilities.

This \"quasi-snapshot\" of the star's nature almost immediately prior to explosion is unprecedented. The RSG varied in brightness, and we posit that it could have been a pulsating variable, possibly with a long period of ~660 days. The largest uncertainty is the host-galaxy distance, which we establish to be 10.73+/-1.76 Mpc. The star was also heavily extinguished by interstellar dust internal to the host, with visual extinction A\\_V(host)~1.7 mag (total A\\_V(tot)~1.8 mag). Dust radiative-transfer modeling reveals the star's circumstellar medium to be quite dusty and silicate-rich, yielding a bolometric luminosity log(L\\_bol/L\\_Sun)=5.08+/-0.16 and a cool effective temperature T\\_eff=2100--2500 K. The available HST optical data had no bearing on the shape of the candidate's observed spectral energy distribution -- for the first time, without the archival JWST observations we would not have been able to detect and characterize the candidate at all. The SN 2025pht progenitor candidate, although quite similar to that of SN 2023ixf, may be the most luminous candidate identified to date.\n\n", "2601.09063": "2026-01-14, **Pre-Supernova Eruptions Triggered by Sudden Energy Deposition in Low-Mass Core-Collapse Supernova Progenitors**, Shuai Zha et.al., [2601.09063v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09063v1)\n\n In low-mass core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors, nuclear burning beyond oxygen can become explosive under degenerate conditions, triggering eruptive mass loss before the final explosion. We investigate such pre-SN eruptions using \\texttt{SNEC} hydrodynamic simulations and realistic stellar models, parameterizing the nuclear energy deposition as a fraction of the binding energy of the combined He layer and H-rich envelope. For the lowest-mass model (9 $M\\_\\odot$), the ejecta mass ($M\\_{\\rm ej}$) scales with the energy gained by the H-rich envelope via a power law (index$\\sim$3.5). Across 9-10 $M\\_\\odot$, this relation shows limited scatter within a factor of $\\sim$2.6, enabling an estimation of the gained energy from $M\\_{\\rm ej}$. The shock passage also flattens the bound envelope, which can affect the SN light curve morphology and provide another diagnostic for the eruption. Then, we compute the associated precursor light curves for the 9 $M\\_\\odot$ model with the multi-group radiative-transfer code \\texttt{STELLA}. These signals are typically faint, with bolometric luminosities of $\\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ lasting hundreds of days. Their cool black-body spectra make them brighter in the infrared, yet several magnitudes fainter than observed pre-SN precursors at the threshold for full envelope ejection. To aid future studies, we make our post-eruption stellar profiles and precursor light curves publicly available.\n\n"}}
