Neutrinos interact electroweakly with background matter and with the magnetic field in the disk since neutrinos are supposed to possess nonzero magnetic moments. The interaction with external fields results in neutrino spin oscillations. We find that the toroidal magnetic field, inherent in the magnetized Polish doughnut, does not cause a significant spin-flip for any reasonable strengths of the toroidal component. The reduction of the observed neutrino flux, owing to neutrino spin oscillations, is predicted. A poloidal component of the magnetic field gives the main contribution to the modification of the observed flux. The neutrino interaction with matter, rotating with relativistic velocities, also changes the flux of neutrinos.

The combined NNLO QCD+NLO EW predictions are achieved based on the fully-differential calculations of cross sections of both the invisible and leptonic processes in proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy.

In this work, we analyze the implications of SIdr on the CMB power spectrum and explore its potential in resolving the Hubble tension. SIdr exhibits two distinct behaviors based on the interacting strength: strongly self-coupled and medium self-coupled. These behaviors are evident in the analysis of CMB data. According to Planck data, the dark radiation component consists of both free-streaming neutrinos and possible SIdr. The total contribution from these components yields relativistic species with $N\\_{\\rm eff}=3.046$. In the framework of universal coupling between dark radiations, a consistent value of $N\\_{\\rm eff}=3.27\\_{-0.31}^{+0.23}$ is obtained. Additionally, this coupling results in an increase in the Hubble constant ($H\\_0$) to $70.1\\_{-1.6}^{+1.3}, \\text{km/s/Mpc}$. However, when considering the number of free-streaming neutrinos as a parameter, the existence of SIdr is not supported. This makes its fraction in radiation to be $R\\_x=0.047^{+0.025}\\_{-0.053}$. Although the Hubble constant is still enhanced, it comes at the expense of a higher $N\\_{\\rm eff}=3.52\\pm0.25$. Our findings reveal that the ACT and SPT data provide support for the presence of SIdr, particularly when considering a variable number of free-streaming species. In this case, SIdr accounts for approximately 12.7\\% of the total radiation content. However, it is important to note that relying solely on SIdr is insufficient to completely resolve the Hubble tension. Finally, we investigate the constraints on SIdr imposed by future experiments, which improve the limits on scaled interacting strength $\\log\\_{10}\\tilde G\\_{\\rm eff}$ by a factor of 4.5 compared to the current constraints.\n\n", "2307.09737": "2023-07-19, **Probing for chiral $Z^\\prime$ gauge boson through scattering measurement experiments**, Kento Asai et.al., [2307.09737v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09737v1)\n\n Observation of tiny neutrino mass can not be explained within the framework of Standard Model (SM) and it allows us to construct beyond the SM (BSM) scenarios.

The dark matter density may be significantly enhanced near the central black hole, and CRs could lose energies predominantly due to scatterings with the ambient dark matter particles. We propose CR cooling in AGN as a new probe of dark matter-proton and dark matter-electron scatterings. Under plausible astrophysical assumptions, our constraints on sub-GeV dark matter can be the strongest derived to date.

For neutrino energies below 100 GeV, the inelastic cross section evaluations have contributions from weak structure functions at low momentum transfers and low hadronic final state invariant mass. To evaluate the size of these contributions to the neutrino cross section, we use a parametrization of the electron-proton structure function, adapted for neutrino scattering, augmented with a correction to account for the partial conservation of the axial vector current, and normalized to structure functions evaluated at next-to-leading order in QCD, with target mass corrections and heavy quark corrections.

How halos are influenced by neutrinos is vital and interesting, and angular momentum (AM) as a significant feature provides a statistical perspective for this issue. Exploring halos from TianNu N-body cosmological simulation with the co-evolving neutrino particles, we obtain some concrete conclusions.

From the two-level divisions, we discover that in denser cubes, the variation of PMR moduli with massive neutrinos decreases more significantly.

The model comprises a three-component gravitational potential (stellar bulge, stellar disk, and a dark matter halo), and a double-power law distribution function (DF), $f(\\mathbf{J})$, which is a function of actions. A Bayesian model-fitting algorithm was implemented that enabled both parameters of the potential and DF to be explored.

Furthermore, we tested the equilibrium assumption and the ability of a double-power law distribution function to represent the stellar halo stars. The model incurs an error in the total enclosed mass of around 10 percent out to 100 kpc, thus justifying the equilibrium assumption. Furthermore, the double-power law DF used proves to be an appropriate description of the investigated M31-like halos.

These properties can be strongly affected by axion dynamics in the early Universe, such as the axion string network and the non-linear dynamics around the QCD phase transition. Recently, improvements in numerical simulation techniques have allowed us to calculate the dark matter axion field from axion strings and QCD effects using different methods: directly with low-tension strings but high resolution, directly with effective high-tension strings, or indirectly by extrapolating an attractor solution.

Also offers the opportunity to study the substructure in the lens plane with implications for dark matter models, as more lensed stars are detected and analysed statistically. Due to the computational demands of simulating microlensing at large magnification factors, it is important to develop fast and accurate analytical approximations for the probability of magnification in such extreme scenarios. In this study, we consider different macro-model magnification and microlensing surface mass density scenarios and study how the probability of extreme magnification factors depends on these factors. To achieve this, we create state of the art large simulations of the microlensing effect in these scenarios. Through the analysis of these simulations, we derive analytical scaling relationships that can bypass the need for expensive numerical simulations.

The shape and tightness of the RAR for rotationally-supported galaxies have characteristics in line with MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and can also arise within the Cosmological Constant + Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) paradigm.

These hooks are challenging to explain in MOND, but we see them in all of our simulated galaxies that are dark-matter dominated and have feedback-induced cores in their dark matter haloes. We show analytically that downward hooks are expected in such cored haloes because they have non-monotonic acceleration profiles. We also make RAR predictions for the outer reaches of our simulated galactic haloes, extending the relation to accelerations below those traced by disc galaxy rotation curves.

Rappaz et.al., [2307.09451v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09451v1)\n\n The intracluster medium (ICM) is the low-density diffuse magnetized plasma in galaxy clusters, which reaches virial temperatures of up to 10^8 K. Under these conditions, the plasma is weakly collisional and therefore has an anisotropic pressure tensor with respect to the local direction of the magnetic field. This triggers very fast, Larmor-scale, pressure-anisotropy-driven kinetic instabilities that alter magnetic field amplification. We study magnetic field amplification through a turbulent small-scale dynamo, including the effects of the kinetic instabilities, during the evolution of a typical massive galaxy cluster. A specific aim of this work is to establish a redshift limit from which a dynamo has to start to amplify the magnetic field up to equipartition with the turbulent velocity field at redshift z=0. We implemented 1D radial profiles for various plasma quantities for merger trees generated with the Modified GALFORM algorithm. We assume that turbulence is driven by successive mergers of dark matter halos and construct effective models for the Reynolds number Re\\_eff dependence on the magnetic field in three different magnetization regimes, including the effects of kinetic instabilities. The magnetic field growth rate is calculated for the different Re\\_eff models. The model results in a higher magnetic field growth rate at higher redshift. For all scenarios considered, to reach equipartition at z=0, the amplification of the magnetic field has to start at redshift z\\_start=1.5 and above. The time to reach equipartition can be significantly shorter, in cases with systematically smaller turbulent forcing scales, and for the highest Re\\_eff models.

The dynamics of the axions and their cosmological evolutions when the level crossing occurs in this scenario are studied in detail. Then we focus our attention on the axion dark matter (DM) abundance.

We obtain the sensitivity curves for LISA, Taiji and TianQin, and explore their projected constraints on the couplings between ULBFs and standard model particles, illustrating with the ULBFs as dark matter.\n\n", "2307.09130": "2023-07-18, **Fundamental sensitivity limit of lossy cavity-enhanced interferometers with external and internal squeezing**, Mikhail Korobko et.al., [2307.09130v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09130v1)\n\n Quantum optical sensors are ubiquitous in various fields of research, from biological or medical sensors to large-scale experiments searching for dark matter or gravitational waves. Gravitational-wave detectors have been very successful in implementing cavities and quantum squeezed light for enhancing sensitivity to signals from black hole or neutron star mergers. However, the sensitivity to weak forces is limited by available energy and optical decoherence in the system. Here, we derive the fundamental sensitivity limit of cavity and squeezed-light enhanced interferometers with optical loss.This limit is attained by the optimal use of an additional internal squeeze operation, which allows to mitigate readout loss. We demonstrate the application of internal squeezing to various scenarios and confirm that it indeed allows to reach the best sensitivity in cavity and squeezed-light enhanced linear force sensors. Our work establishes the groundwork for the future development of optimal sensors in real-world scenarios where, up until now, the application of squeezed light was curtailed by various sources of decoherence.\n\n", "2307.09015": "2023-07-18, **Is the correlation between the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio and the number of dwarf galaxies in tension with $\u039b$CDM?**, Oliver M\u00fcller et.al., [2307.09015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09015v1)\n\n Previous results suggest that there exists a correlation between the size of the bulge of a galaxy and the number of its dwarf galaxy satellites. This was found to be inconsistent with the standard model of cosmology based on comparisons to semi-analytical dark matter-only simulations, where no such correlation was found. In this work, we extend these studies using the volume-complete ELVES dwarf galaxy catalog, which increases the number of systems compared to previous work by a factor of four. For each giant galaxy we compile the bulge-to-total baryonic mass (B/T) ratio and put it as a function of the number of dwarf galaxies surrounding them within 250 kpc (N$\\_{250}$). For the 29 galaxy systems in the ELVES catalog, we find a linear relation between B/T and N$\\_{250}$ which is consistent with previous data. However, for a given stellar mass of the host galaxy this relation is mainly driven by their morphology, where early-type galaxies have a larger B/T ratio and a larger N$\\_{250}$ than late type galaxies. By investigating spiral galaxies in Illustris-TNG100, we tested whether the inclusion of baryons in the simulations will change the results based on Millennium-II. Contrary to dark matter-only simulations, we do find a correlation between B/T and N$\\_{250}$, indicating that the standard model of cosmology does predict a correlation. The empirical relation between the number of satellites and the bulge to total stellar mass is therefore not necessarily in tension with $\\Lambda$CDM.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2307.09917": "2023-07-19, **Photospheric velocity evolution of SN 2020bvc: signature of $r$-process nucleosynthesis from a collapsar**, Long Li et.al., [2307.09917v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09917v1)\n\n Whether binary neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical site of rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) nucleosynthesis remains unknown. Collapsars associated with long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and hypernovae are promising candidates. Simulations have shown that outflows from collapsar accretion disks can produce enough $r$-process materials to explain the abundances in the universe. However, there is no observational evidence to confirm this result at present. SN 2020bvc is a broad-lined type Ic (Ic-BL) supernova (SN) possibly associated with a low-luminosity GRB. Based on semi-analytic SN emission models with and without $r$-process materials, we perform a fitting to the multi-band light curves and photospheric velocities of SN 2020bvc. We find that in a $r$-process-enriched model the mixing of $r$-process materials slows down the photospheric recession and therefore matches the velocity evolution better. The fitting results show that $r$-process materials with mass of $\\approx0.36~M\\_\\odot$ and opacity of $\\approx4~\\rm cm^2~g^{-1}$ is needed to mix with about half of the SN ejecta. Our fitting results are weakly dependent on the nebular emission.

M. Becerra et.al., [2307.09646v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09646v1)\n\n The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model explains long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated with supernovae (SNe) Ic through physical episodes that occur in a binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion in close orbit. The CO core collapse triggers the cataclysmic event, originating the SN and a newborn NS (hereafter $\\nu$NS) at its center. The $\\nu$NS and the NS accrete SN matter. BdHNe are classified based on the NS companion fate and the GRB energetics, mainly determined by the orbital period. In BdHNe I, the orbital period is of a few minutes, so the accretion causes the NS to collapse into a Kerr black hole (BH), explaining GRBs of energies $>10^{52}$ erg. BdHN II, with longer periods of tens of minutes, yields a more massive but stable NS, accounting for GRBs of $10^{50}$--$10^{52}$ erg. BdHNe III have still longer orbital periods (e.g., hours), so the NS companion has a negligible role, which explains GRBs with a lower energy release of $<10^{50}$ erg. BdHN I and II might remain bound after the SN, so they could form NS-BH and binary NS (BNS), respectively. In BdHN III, the SN likely disrupts the system. We perform numerical simulations of BdHN II to compute the characteristic parameters of the BNS left by them, their mergers, and the associated short GRBs. We obtain the mass of the central remnant, whether it is likely to be a massive NS or a BH, the conditions for disk formation and its mass, and the event's energy release.

Exposing this model to CMB, BAO, and supernova data, we demonstrate that the use of marginalized posterior distributions can easily lead to misleading conclusions on the viability of a high-dimensional model such as this one. We discuss such pitfalls and corresponding mitigation strategies, which can be used to search for an observationally favored region of the parameter space. We further show that the HDGDM model in particular does show promise in terms of its ability to ease the Hubble tension once such techniques are employed, and we find interesting features in the best-fitting equation of state that can serve as an inspiration for future model building.\n\n", "2307.09501": "2023-07-18, **Addressing the Hubble tension with cosmic chronometers**, Michele Moresco et.al., [2307.09501v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09501v1)\n\n Twenty years after the discovery that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, a new finding is now challenging our understanding of the cosmos. Recent studies have shown that the Hubble constant, the speed of expansion measured today, provides values in significant tension when measured from the Cosmic Microwave Background in the primordial Universe or from Cepheids and Supernovae Type Ia in the local Universe. Whether this tension is hinting towards new physics or some issue in the measurements, is still under debate; but it is clearly calling for new independent cosmological probes to provide additional pieces of evidence to solve this puzzle. This chapter introduces the method of cosmic chronometers, a new emerging cosmological probe that can provide cosmology-independent estimates of the Universe's expansion history. This method is based on the fact that the expansion rate of the Universe can be directly derived from measuring how much the Universe has changed in age between two different redshifts, i.e. by estimating the slope of the age--redshift relation. First, the main ingredients of the method will be discussed, presenting the main equations involved and how to estimate from the observables the needed quantities. After, it will be presented how to reliably select a sample of tracers to map the age evolution of the Universe coherently. Next, different methods to robustly measure the differential age of a population, the fundamental quantity involved in the method, will be reviewed. Finally, the main measurements obtained will be presented, providing forecasts for future surveys and discussing how these data can provide useful feedback to address the Hubble tension.\n\n", "2307.09418": "2023-07-18, **Influence of the tetraneutron on the EoS under core-collapse supernovae and heavy-ion collisions conditions**, Helena Pais et.al., [2307.09418v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09418v1)\n\n Recently, a resonant state of four neutrons (tetraneutron) with an energy of $E\\_{4n}=2.37\\pm 0.38 \\rm{(stat)} \\pm 0.44 \\rm{(sys)}$ MeV and a width of $\\Gamma=1.75\\pm 0.22 \\rm{(stat)} \\pm 0.30 \\rm{(sys)}$ MeV was reported. In this work, we analyse the effect of including such an exotic state on the yields of other light clusters, that not only form in astrophysical sites, such as core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, but also in heavy-ion collisions. To this aim, we use a relativistic mean-field formalism, where we consider in-medium effects in a two-fold way, via the couplings of the clusters to the mesons, and via a binding energy shift, to compute the low-density equation of state for nuclear matter at finite temperature and fixed proton fraction. We consider five light clusters, deuterons, tritons, heliums, $\\alpha$-particles, and $^6$He, immersed in a gas of protons and neutrons, and we calculate their abundances and chemical equilibrium constants with and without the tetraneutron. We also analyse how the associated energy of the tetraneutron would influence such results. We find that the low-temperature, neutron-rich systems, are the ones most affected by the presence of the tetraneutron, making neutron stars excellent environments for their formation. Moreover, its presence in strongly asymmetric matter may increase considerably the proton and the $\\alpha$-particle fractions. This may have an influence on the dissolution of the accretion disk of the merger of two neutron stars.\n\n", "2307.08967": "2023-07-18, **New estimation of the nuclear de-excitation line emission from the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A**, Bing Liu et.al., [2307.08967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08967v1)\n\n MeV nuclear de-excitation lines serve as a unique tool to study low-energy cosmic rays (CRs), containing both spectral and elemental information of the interacting material.
