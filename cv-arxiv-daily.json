Since the dark energy equation of state is correlated with neutrino masses, we reassess constraints on the neutrino mass sum focusing on the model-agnostic equation of state.

In principle, this shift could be observable in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We investigate the effect of fermionic, non-interacting DM when observing a large number of GW events from DM-admixed BNSs with the precision of the proposed Einstein telescope (ET).

For this purpose, we create event catalogues of BNS mock events with DM fraction up to 1%, from which we reconstruct the posterior uncertainties with the Fisher matrix approach. Using this data, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the baryonic EOS, DM particle mass, and DM particle fraction in each event. Our results reveal that when falsely ignoring DM effects, the EOS posterior is biased towards softer EOSs, though the offset is rather small. Further, we find that within our assumptions of our DM model and population, ET will likely not be able to test the presence of DM in BNSs, even when combining many events and adding Cosmic Explorer (CE) to the next-generation detector network.

The new force carrier has a relatively stronger coupling with the beyond standard model (BSM) sector, while its interaction with the SM fields is much weaker. This weaker coupling is induced through mixing mechanisms, specifically via gauge kinetic mixing and the $Z-Z'$ mixing. We consider a scenario where the new gauge boson decays mostly to charge-neutral long-lived particles and/or dark matter (DM). We show how producing and detecting this heavier invisible $Z'$, that will be beyond the reach of even the very high luminosity LHC, becomes possible if it is produced in association with an energetic photon at the future muon collider.

We argue that such a composite ALP emerges as a bound state -- the dark glueball -- due to confinement in a pure Yang-Mills dark sector. In a minimal ultraviolet complete QCD-like model, cosmological production of dark gluons as well as photons occurs via heavy fermion annihilation which effectively reheats both the dark and visible sectors setting up their temperature scales. Furthermore, effective interactions between glueballs and photons, resembling those of standard ALPs, are radiatively generated by heavy fermion loops. Consequently, DM glueballs interacting with photons are dubbed `Glueball ALPs' (GALPs).

The UAr cryogenics system must maintain stable thermodynamic conditions throughout the experiment's lifetime of >10 years. Continuous removal of impurities and radon from the UAr is essential for maximising signal yield and mitigating background. We are developing an efficient and powerful cryogenics system with a gas purification loop with a target circulation rate of 1000 slpm. Central to its design is a condenser operated with liquid nitrogen which is paired with a gas heat exchanger cascade, delivering a combined cooling power of >8 kW. Here we present the design choices in view of the DS-20k requirements, in particular the condenser's working principle and the cooling control, and we show test results obtained with a dedicated benchmarking platform at CERN and LNGS.

It is commonly assumed that the pressure inside an NS is isotropic, but in reality, pressure is locally anisotropic. This study explores the properties of anisotropic NS with a subfraction of DM (isotropic) trapped inside. Implementing a two-fluid formalism with three Equations of State (EOS): AP3 (a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction model), BSk22 (modeling atomic nuclei and neutron-matter), and MPA1 (considering relativistic effects in nuclear interactions). The properties of NS, such as mass ($M$), radius ($R$), and dimensionless tidal deformability ($\\Lambda$), for various DM-anisotropic configurations, have been rigorously tested against observational constraints. These constraints include data from the binary NS merger GW170817, NICER x-ray measurements, and pulsar mass-radius observations. We observe that with increasing DM subfraction, higher anisotropies could also satisfy the observational constraints. Furthermore, increasing the coupling ($g$) between DM and its mediator leads to the formation of a core-halo structure, with a DM halo surrounding the baryonic matter (BM). Specifically, for coupling values of $g = 10^{-4}$, $10^{-3.7}$, and $10^{-3.5}$, we observe that the maximum radius ($R\\_{max}$) decreases with increasing anisotropy, which contrasts with the behavior at $g = 10^{-5}$ and in scenarios with no DM.

We analyze the gri light curves of SLSNe II obtained through ZTF. We study peak absolute magnitudes and characteristic timescales. When possible we compute g-r colors, pseudo-bolometric light curves, and estimate lower limits for their total radiated energy. We also study the luminosity distribution of our sample and estimate the percentage of them that would be observable by the LSST. Finally, we compare our sample to other H-rich SNe and to H-poor SLSNe I. SLSNe II are heterogeneous. Their median peak absolute magnitude is -20.3 mag in optical bands. Their rise can take from two weeks to over three months, and their decline from twenty days to over a year. We found no significant correlations between peak magnitude and timescales. SLSNe II tend to show fainter peaks, longer declines and redder colors than SLSNe I. We present the largest sample of SLSNe II light curves to date, comprising of 107 events. Their diversity could be explained by considering different CSM morphologies. Although, theoretical analysis is needed to explore alternative scenarios. Other luminous transients, such as Active Galactic Nuclei, Tidal Disruption Events or SNe Ia-CSM, can easily become contaminants. Thus, good multi-wavelength light curve coverage becomes paramount. LSST could miss 30 percent of the ZTF events in the its footprint in gri bands. Redder bands become important to construct complete samples.\n\n", "2408.15017": "2024-08-27, **Unveiling the central engine of core-collapse supernovae in the Local Universe: NS or BH?**, Maurice H. P. M. van Putten et.al., [2408.15017v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15017v1)\n\n The physical trigger powering supernovae following the core collapse of massive stars is believed to involve a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH), depending largely on progenitor mass. A potentially distinct signature is a long-duration gravitational wave (GW) burst from BH central engines by their ample energy reservoir $E\\_J$ in angular momentum, far more so than an NS can provide. A natural catalyst for this radiation is surrounding high-density matter in the form of a non-axisymmetric disk or torus. Here, we derive a detailed outlook on LVK probes of core-collapse supernovae CC-SNe during the present observational run O4 based on their event rate, an association with normal long GRBs and mass-scaling of GW170817B/GRB170817A.

We have analysed five different models of $f(Q,T)$ gravity and tested them against Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometer data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations data and Pantheon data. We put stringent constraints on the $f(Q,T)$ gravity models, $f(Q,T) = Q^{n} +\\beta T$ $(n=1,2,3)$, $f(Q,T)=-\\alpha Q-\\beta T^{2}$ and $f(Q,T)=Q^{-2}T^{2}$ along with other cosmological parameters such as deceleration parameter, equation of state parameter and demonstrate their alignment with the $\\Lambda CDM$ model and the observational data.

High-resolution, wide-area radio surveys at low frequencies are ideal tools with which to find missing SNRs, given the prominence of these sources at low radio frequencies.

We used LoTSS total intensity maps of two Galactic regions, one with $39^\\mathrm{o} < l < 66^\\mathrm{o}$ and $\\|b\\|< 2.5^\\mathrm{o}$, and the other with $145^\\mathrm{o} < l < 150^\\mathrm{o}$ and $\\|b\\| < 3^\\mathrm{o}$, in addition to mid-infrared (MIR) data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) all-sky survey to search for SNR candidates.

We also follow up on 24 previously reported SNR candidates, inferring their spectral index between the LoTSS frequency (144 MHz) and the frequency at which they were reported. The high resolution and sensitivity of LoTSS observations has resulted in the detection of 14 new SNR candidates.

Early mass segregation during cluster assembly**, Brooke Polak et.al., [2408.14592v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14592v1)\n\n Mass segregation is seen in many star clusters, but whether massive stars form in the center of a cluster or migrate there dynamically is still debated. N-body simulations have shown that early dynamical mass segregation is possible when sub-clusters merge to form a dense core with a small crossing time. However, the effect of gas dynamics on both the formation and dynamics of the stars could inhibit the formation of the dense core. We aim to study the dynamical mass segregation of star cluster models that include gas dynamics and self-consistently form stars from the dense substructure in the gas. Our models use the Torch framework, which is based on AMUSE and includes stellar and magnetized gas dynamics, as well as stellar evolution and feedback from radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae. Our models consist of three star clusters forming from initial turbulent spherical clouds of mass $10^{4,5,6}\\rm~M\\_\\odot$ and radius $11.7\\rm~pc$ that have final stellar masses of $3.6\\times10^3\\rm~M\\_\\odot$, $6.5\\times10^4\\rm~M\\_\\odot$, and $8.9\\times10^5\\rm~M\\_\\odot$, respectively. There is no primordial mass segregation in the model by construction. All three clusters become dynamically mass segregated at early times via collapse confirming that this mechanism occurs within sub-clusters forming directly out of the dense substructure in the gas. The dynamics of the embedded gas and stellar feedback do not inhibit the collapse of the cluster. We find that each model cluster becomes mass segregated within $2~$Myr of the onset of star formation, reaching the levels observed in young clusters in the Milky Way. However, we note that the exact values are highly time-variable during these early phases of evolution. Massive stars that segregate to the center during core collapse are likely to be dynamically ejected, a process that can decrease the overall level of mass segregation again.\n\n", "2408.14586": "2024-08-26, **Optical and Radio Analysis of Systemically Classified Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility**, Gokul P.

We present the light curves (LCs) for each of the SNe, and analyze the shape of the LCs to derive empirical parameters, along with the explosion epochs for every event. The sample has an average absolute peak magnitude in the r band of $M\\_r^{max}$ = -18.51 $\\pm$ 0.15 mag. Using spectra obtained around peak light, we compute expansion velocities from the Fe II 5169 Angstrom line for each event with high enough signal-to-noise ratio spectra, and find an average value of $v\\_{ph}$ = 16,100 $\\pm$ 1,100 km $s^{-1}$.

We find that the populations that have radio detections and radio non-detections are indistinct from one another with respect to their optically-inferred explosion properties, and there are no statistically significant correlations present between the events' radio luminosities and optically-inferred explosion properties. This provides evidence that the explosion properties derived from optical data alone cannot give inferences about the radio properties of SNe Ic-BL, and likely their relativistic jet formation mechanisms.\n\n", "2408.14573": "2024-08-26, **Deep Einstein@Home search for Continuous Gravitational Waves from the Central Compact Objects in the Supernova Remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 using LIGO public data**, Jing Ming et.al., [2408.14573v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14573v1)\n\n We perform a search for continuous nearly monochromatic gravitational waves from the central compact objects associated with the supernova remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3 using LIGO O2 and O3 public data. Over $10^{18}$ different waveforms are considered, covering signal frequencies between 20-1300 Hz (20-400 Hz) for G347.3-0.5 (Vela Jr) and a very broad range of frequency derivatives. Thousands of volunteers donating compute cycles through the computing project Einstein@Home have made this endeavour possible. Following the Einstein@Home search, we perform multi-stage follow-ups of over 5 million waveforms. The selection threshold is set so that a signal could be confirmed using the first half of the LIGO O3 data. We find no significant signal candidate for either targets. Based on this null result, for G347.3-0.5, we set the most constraining upper limits to date on the amplitude of gravitational wave signals, corresponding to deformations below $10^{-6}$ in a large part of the search band.

Peterson et.al., [2408.14560v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14560v1)\n\n At the low-redshift end ($z<0.05$) of the Hubble diagram with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), the contribution to Hubble residual scatter from peculiar velocities is of similar size to that due to the standardization of the SN Ia light curve. A way to improve the redshift measurement of the SN host galaxy is to utilize the average redshift of the galaxy group, effectively averaging over small-scale/intracluster peculiar velocities. One limiting factor is the fraction of SN host galaxies in galaxy groups, previously found to be 30% using (relatively incomplete) magnitude-limited galaxy catalogs. Here, we do the first analysis of N-body simulations to predict this fraction, finding $\\sim$66% should have associated groups and group averaging should improve redshift precision by $\\sim$120 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, using spectroscopic data from the Anglo-Australian Telescope, we present results from the first pilot program to evaluate whether or not 23 previously unassociated SN Ia hosts belong in groups. We find that 91% of these candidates can be associated with groups, consistent with predictions from simulations given the sample size. Combining with previously assigned SN host galaxies in Pantheon+, we demonstrate improvement in Hubble residual scatter equivalent to 145 km s$^{-1}$, also consistent with simulations.

The inferred temperature from these absorption lines far exceeds the virial temperature of the MW, and the column densities are also too large to be easily explained. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to explain these observations and claim that they may not have originated from the CGM, but from a totally different type of source, namely, stellar ejecta from supernovae (SNe) above the Galactic disk that happen to lie in the line of sight to the background quasars. About $\\sim 20\\%$ of massive OB stars (progenitors of core-collapse supernovae) are known to be runaway stars that have high ejection velocities near the Galactic plane and can end up exploding as SNe above the Galactic disk. We show that the associated reverse shock in the supernova remnant in the early non-radiative phase can heat the ejecta to temperatures of $\\gtrsim 10^7\\,{\\rm K}$ and can naturally explain the observed high column density of ions in the observed `super-virial' phase along with $\\alpha$-enriched super-solar abundance that is typical of core-collapse supernovae.

The Fe He$\\alpha$ lines are, on the other hand, substantially broadened with $\\sigma\\_v \\sim 1670$ km s$^{-1}$. This broadening can be explained by a combination of the thermal Doppler effect due to the high ion temperature and the kinematic Doppler effect due to the SNR expansion.
