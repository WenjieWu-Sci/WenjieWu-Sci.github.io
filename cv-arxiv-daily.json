Such outflows, which can reach mildly relativistic velocities, are often observed forming bubble structures. Wind bubbles are expected to develop strong wind termination shocks, sites of great interest for diffusive shock acceleration. We develop a model of diffusive shock acceleration in the wind bubbles powered by ULXs. We find that the maximum energy in these objects can easily reach the PeV range, promoting ULX winds as a new class of PeVatrons. We specialize our model in the context of the Galactic source SS 433 and show that high-energy protons in the bubble might explain the highest energy photons (>100 TeV) and their morphology recently observed by LHAASO. We discuss the detectability of such a source in neutrinos and we analyze the possible radio counterpart of ULXs focusing on the case of W50, the nebula surrounding SS 433. We finally discuss the possible contribution of Galactic ULXs to the cosmic-ray flux at the knee concluding that their role might be substantial.\n\n", "2411.08604": "2024-11-13, **Production of GEM-like structures using laser-cutting techniques**, L. M. Ramos et.al., [2411.08604v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08604v1)\n\n To enhance the ionization yield of liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPC) used in dark matter and neutrino experiments it was proposed the use of dopants in LAr, with ionization energies below the scintillation threshold of Ar. While dual-phase LArTPCs have excellent sensitivity to single ionization electrons, their compatibility with photosensitive dopants is hindered by gas-phase electroluminescence photons ionizing the dopants, leading to a positive feedback loop. This can be addressed by optically decoupling the gaseous and liquid phases with a barrier that transmits electrons. A possible solution relies on the use of a pair of structures based on Gaseous Electron Multipliers(GEMs) with misaligned holes. Rather than amplifying electron signals in gas pockets within their holes, their holes will be filled with LAr and a low biasing voltage, so that incident drifting electrons are drawn into the holes but not amplified. Instead, amplification will occur in the gas phase above the structures. Its core element is a GEM-like structure machined from polyethylene naphthalate(PEN). Since PEN scintillates in the visible spectrum, the risk of increased radioactivity due to the larger mass compared to traditional wire grids is negated by the potential to veto its own radioactivity. As such, these structures may also be a useful alternative to wire grids. In this work, we report the newest developments on the production of GEM-like structures using laser-based techniques, namely the manufacture of the first batch PEN and PMMA-based GEM-like structures. This process allows low-cost, reproducible fabrication of a high volume of such structures. In addition to being a low radioactive technique, we expect that it will allow the scaling up of the production of these structures at a reduced cost. First tests indicate good electrical stability, while the performance assessment is still ongoing.\n\n", "2411.08555": "2024-11-13, **The two alternative explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae: 2024 status report**, Noam Soker et.al., [2411.08555v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08555v1)\n\n In comparing the two alternative explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), I examine recent three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of CCSNe in the frame of the delayed-neutrino explosion mechanism (neutrino mechanism) and argue that these valuable simulations show that neutrino heating can supply a non-negligible fraction of the explosion energy but not the observed energies, hence cannot be the primary explosion mechanism. In addition to the energy crisis, the neutrino mechanism predicts many failed supernovae that are not observed. The most challenging issue of the neutrino mechanism is that it cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies of CCSN remnants, many of which were identified in 2024. These contradictions with observations imply that the neutrino mechanism cannot be the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe. The alternative jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) seems to be the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe; neutrino heating boosts the energy of the jittering jets. Even if some simulations show explosions of stellar models (but usually with energies below observed), it does not mean that the neutrino mechanism is the explosion mechanism. Jittering jets, which simulations do not include, can explode the core before the neutrino heating process does. Morphological signatures of jets in many CCSN remnants suggest that jittering jets are the primary driving mechanism, as expected by the JJEM.\n\n", "2411.08542": "2024-11-13, **Neutrino mass experiments: current and future**, Larisa A.

Due to its unique characteristics, determining this neutrino property requires new measurement techniques to be developed.

Determining the survival probability of neutrinos in asymptotic states is paramount to incorporating flavor conversions' effects in the theoretical modeling of CCSN and BNSM. Some phenomenological schemes have shown good performance in approximating asymptotic states of fast neutrino-flavor conversions (FFCs), known as one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes induced by neutrino self-interactions. However, a recent study showed that they would yield qualitatively different asymptotic states of FFC if the neutrino number is forced to evolve. It is not yet fully understood why the canonical phenomenological models fail to predict asymptotic states. In this paper, we perform detailed investigations through numerical simulations and then provide an intuitive explanation with a quasi-homogeneous analysis. Based on the analysis, we propose a new phenomenological model, in which the quasi-steady evolution of FFCs is analytically determined. The model also allows us to express the convolution term of spatial wave number as a concise form, which corresponds to useful information on analyses for the non-linear feedback from small-scale flavor conversions to large-scale ones. Our model yields excellent agreement with numerical simulations, which lends support to our interpretation.\n\n", "2411.08330": "2024-11-13, **Collisional Approach for Open Neutrino Systems**, W. L.

A Born-Markov equation is derived, linking decoherence, dissipation, decay rates, and scattering cross sections.

The initial scattering and final bound states are described by Coulomb potentials with different strengths, as relevant for non-abelian gauge interactions or theories featuring charged scalars. For bound states with generic quantum numbers $n$ and $\\ell$, we provide closed-form expressions for the bound-state formation (BSF) cross sections of monopole, dipole and quadrupole transitions, and of arbitrary multipole order when $\\ell=n-1$. This allows us to investigate in detail a strong enhancement of BSF that occurs for initial states in a repulsive potential. For $\\ell=n-1\\gg 1$, we show that the BSF cross section for each single bound state violates the perturbative unitarity bound in the vicinity of a certain critical initial velocity, and provide an interpretation in terms of a smooth matching of classical trajectories. When summing the BSF cross section over all possible bound states in the final state, this leads to a unitarity violation below a certain velocity, but within the validity range of the weakly coupled non-relativistic description. We identify an effectively strong interaction as the origin of this unitarity violation, which is caused by an \"anomalously\" large overlap of scattering and bound-state wave functions in Coulomb potentials of different strength.\n\n", "2411.08565": "2024-11-13, **The overconcentrated dark halo in the strong lens SDSS J0946+1006 is a subhalo: evidence for self interacting dark matter?**, Wolfgang J. R. Enzi et.al., [2411.08565v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08565v1)\n\n The nature of dark matter is poorly constrained on subgalactic scales. Alternative models to cold dark matter, such as warm dark matter or self-interacting dark matter, could produce very different dark haloes on these scales. One of the few known dark haloes smaller than a galaxy was discovered in the triple source plane strong lens system J0946+1006. Previous studies have found that this structure is much more concentrated than expected in $\\Lambda$CDM, but have assumed the dark halo is at the same redshift as the main deflector ($z\\_{\\rm main}=0.222$). In this paper, we fit for the redshift of this dark halo. We reconstruct the first two sources in the system using a forward modelling approach, allowing for additional complexity from multipole perturbations. We find that the perturber redshift is $z\\_{\\rm halo} = {0.207}^{+0.019}\\_{-0.019}$, and lower bounds on the evidence strongly prefer a subhalo over a line-of-sight structure. Whilst modelling both background sources does not improve constraints on the redshift of the subhalo, it breaks important degeneracies affecting the reconstruction of multipole perturbations. We find that the subhalo is a more than $5\\sigma$ outlier from the $\\Lambda$CDM $v\\_{\\rm max}$-$r\\_{\\rm max}$ relation and has a steep profile with an average slope of $\\gamma\\_{\\rm 2D} = {-1.81}^{+0.15}\\_{-0.11}$ for radii between $0.75-1.25$ kpc.

In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) models, utilizing CMB, DESI BAO, and SN data. By considering the combined DESI BAO and SN data, we determine that in the IHDE model, the parameter $c > 1$ and the dark-energy equation of state $w$ does not cross $-1$ at the $1\\sigma$ confidence level, whereas in the HDE model, it marginally falls below this threshold. Upon incorporating CMB data, we observe that in the HDE model, the parameter $c < 1$ and $w$ crosses $-1$ at a level beyond $10\\sigma$. Conversely, for the IHDE model, the likelihood of $w$ crossing $-1$ is considerably diminished, implying that the introduction of interaction within the HDE model could potentially resolve or mitigate the cosmic big rip conundrum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the HDE and IHDE models are statistically as viable as the $\\Lambda$CDM model when assessing Bayesian evidence with DESI BAO data combined with SN data.

In practice, this effort is often entangled with assumptions of dark energy. A combination of distance ($D\\_{\\rm M}$, $D\\_{\\rm L}$) and expansion rate ($H(z)$) measurements can break this degeneracy. However, fitting against discrete data points requires parameterizations of distance and expansion rate as functions of redshifts, which often induces cosmological model dependence.

Fitting data combining distance ($D\\_{\\rm M}$, $D\\_{\\rm L}$) and Hubble parameter (or equivalently $D\\_H$) measurements, we are then able to obtain $\\Omega\\_K$ in a dark energy model-independent manner. We test this parameterization and the associated fitting scheme with mock data generated with a wide range of fiducial dark energy equations of state ($-1.3<w<1.3$), finding that the best-fit $\\Omega\\_K$ is always unbiased.
