Model predictions for those are influenced by the properties of cosmic-ray sources, and understanding the impact of cosmic-ray sources on Galactic diffuse emissions is key for interpreting measurements by LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube, and the upcoming SWGO. We consider supernova remnants as prototypical cosmic-ray sources and study the impact of their discreteness on the Galactic diffuse emissions in different source injection and near-source transport models in a stochastic Monte Carlo study. Three lessons exemplify the results of our simulations: First, the distributions of Galactic diffuse emission intensities can be described by a mixture model of stable laws and Gaussian distributions. Second, the maximal deviations caused by discrete sources across the sky depend on energy, reaching typically tens of percent in burst-like and energy-dependent escape scenarios but order unity or larger in a time-dependent diffusion scenario. Third, the additional model uncertainty from source stochasticity is subdominant in burst-like and energy-dependent escape scenarios, but becomes sizeable above some tens of TeV in the time-dependent diffusion scenario, where it can help reconcile model predictions with LHAASO measurements. With increased spatial resolution, especially at energies beyond tens of TeV, measurements of Galactic diffuse emissions can be expected to constrain source models and locate cosmic ray sources.\n\n", "2509.06699": "2025-09-08, **Magnetic, thermal and rotational evolution of isolated neutron stars**, Jos\u00e9 A. Pons et.al., [2509.06699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06699v1)\n\n The strong magnetic fields of neutron stars are closely linked to their observed thermal, spectral, and timing properties, such as the distribution of spin periods and their derivatives. To understand the evolution of astrophysical observables over time, it is essential to develop robust theoretical frameworks and numerical models that solve the coupled thermal and magnetic field evolution equations, incorporating detailed microphysical inputs like thermal and electrical conductivities and neutrino emission rates. These efforts are key to uncovering how the strength and geometry of magnetic fields change with age, ultimately shedding light on the diverse phenomenology of neutron stars. In this review, we outline the fundamental theory underlying magneto-thermal evolution models, with an emphasis on numerical methods and a comprehensive set of benchmark tests intended to guide current and future code development.

The Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1), the first telescope of the LST array, part of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) North site, is particularly well-suited for real-time, rapid follow-up of transients. In this contribution, we present the latest achievements of the transient observational program with LST-1, which is now in advanced commissioning on La Palma, Canary Islands. We outline the observational strategies in place and describe the dynamic handling of events by the transient handler of LST-1 (e.g., its ability to handle poorly localised events, including gravitational waves, GRBs and neutrinos).

In its planned 2027 launch, PBR will study Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays, Neutrinos, and High-Altitude Horizontal Airshowers from 33 km above the Earth. By operating at balloon altitudes, PBR will provide a novel vantage point to study air-shower physics while offering competitive instantaneous exposure to neutrinos from transient astrophysical phenomena. The payload's optical instrument is a 0.95 m$^2$ aperture hybrid Schmidt telescope with a 3.81 m$^2$ segmented mirror focusing light onto a Fluorescence Camera and a bi-focalized Cherenkov Camera. The payload will also feature a Radio Instrument consisting of two sinuous antennas based on the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) low-frequency instrument. A combined gamma ray/x-ray detector and IR cloud camera round out the instrumentation package, meaning PBR will be the first multi-hybrid balloon-borne multi-messenger observatory flown. This extensive instrumentation must be combined into a radio quiet payload that satisfies the scientific needs and can operate in near vacuum at extreme temperatures, all while meeting NASA safety requirements and weighing no more than 3000 lbs (1361 kg). Accomplishing these tasks together will mark a significant step toward establishing technological readiness for the POEMMA satellite mission.

The accumulated dark matter thermalizes and concentrates in the stellar interior, forming a dark matter core. In this work, we propose a novel framework in which a $\\mathbb{Z}\\_3$ symmetry allows for number-changing self-interactions of the form $3 \\rightarrow 2$ within the dark sector. These cannibalistic reactions become increasingly efficient at high dark matter densities, leading to a significant depletion of the dark matter population in the stellar core. This number depletion heats up the neutron star above the standard cooling expectations, yielding observable thermal signatures in relatively old, isolated neutron stars, potentially detectable via James Webb Space Telescope. We show that even in the presence of other heating mechanisms, e.g. dark matter annihilation and kinetic heating, the cannibal heating dominates for certain parameter space. We demonstrate that the cannibal heating can predict detectable heating signatures in old neutron stars, thereby allowing a broader range of viable dark matter masses and couplings to the Standard Model.\n\n", "2509.06805": "2025-09-08, **Euclid preparation.

Euclid is expected to detect a large number of optically-selected galaxy clusters over the approximately 14000 square degrees of its extragalactic sky survey. Extending out well beyond redshift unity, the catalogue will contain many new high-redshift clusters, while at lower redshifts a fraction of the clusters will have been observed in other surveys. Identifying these known clusters as counterparts to the Euclid-detected clusters is an important step in the validation and construction of the ECGC to augment information with external observables. We present a set of catalogues and meta-catalogues of known clusters that we have assembled for this step, and we illustrate their application and our methodology using the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 RedMaPPer cluster catalogue in lieu of the future ECGC.

However, their large parameter counts and ''black-box'' nature make it difficult to assess whether their decisions adhere to physical principles. To address this issue, we have built a Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN) that reduces parameter count and enhances interpretability, and propose a novel analytical framework to understand the network's decision-making process. With this framework, we leverage our network to qualitatively assess the offset between the dark matter distribution center and the galaxy cluster center, as well as the size of heating regions in different models. These findings are consistent with current theoretical predictions and show the reliability and interpretability of our network. By combining network interpretability with unseen test results, we also estimate that for SIDM in galaxy clusters, the minimum cross-section $(\\sigma/m)\\_{\\mathrm{th}}$ required to reliably identify its collisional nature falls between $0.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{g}$ and $0.3\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{g}$.

In this model, both the DM components are stable due to the remaining $Z\\_4$ gauge symmetry, which is the remnant of the $U(1)^\\prime$ local symmetry. When the resonance condition for DM masses is fulfilled, we show that the elastic co-scattering processes between two components of dark matter ($u$-channel processes) are enhanced due to the Yukawa potential with a small effective mass for the lighter DM mediator, so we can use such co-scattering processes for dark matter to explain the small-scale problems at galaxies. Moreover, there are also semi-annihilation processes that two components of dark matter annihilate into one dark matter particle and a dark photon/Higgs, which are enhanced by the $u$-channel Sommerfeld factor. Focusing on some benchmark models for two-component dark matter satisfying the observed relic density, we obtain the bounds for the dark photon portal couplings from the direct detection for boosted dark matter, which is produced from the semi-annihilation processes at the galactic center.\n\n", "2509.06684": "2025-09-08, **Core or Halo?

Our analysis begins with the mass-radius (M-R) relation, showing that the inclusion of DM enables stellar configurations to reach the mass range compatible with the GW190814 event. We identify both DM core and DM halo morphologies among the viable EOSs, with core dominated and halo dominated cases exhibiting distinct signatures. By fixing the stellar mass within the GW190814 range, we constrain the possible dark matter fractions and explore the role of different interaction channels. Using the EOSs consistent with these constraints, we further investigate the tidal deformability ($\\Lambda$), moment of inertia (MOI), and stellar radius, finding broad agreement with constraints from GW170817, GW190814, and NICER. Finally, we compile the characteristic properties of DAQSs, including EOS type, DM fractions, morphology (core vs halo), and macroscopic observables in a comparative summary.

The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the SN environment metallicities show Type Ib and Type Ic SNe tending towards higher metallicity than Type IIP. We test the null hypothesis that Type Ib/Ic/IIP progenitors are drawn from the same parent population. There is no statistically significant difference between progenitors of Type Ib and Type Ic SNe. However, when comparing Ib/Ic with IIP SNe, the tests indicate strong statistical significance (significance level better than 1\\%) to reject our null hypothesis suggesting that the samples are not drawn from the same parent population. The significance is even higher (level better 0.1\\%) when testing Type IIP vs. the combined Type Ib+Ic sample. These results support a different physical nature of Type IIP and Types Ib/Ic progenitors. It challenges stellar evolution and SNe explosion models to reproduce the distinct CDFs found.\n\n"}}
