This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth $\u03c4$ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of $\u03c4$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x\\_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$\u03b1$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining $x\\_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$ with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain $\u03c4=0.0552^{+0.0019}\\_{-0.0026}$, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining $\u03c4=0.0552^{+0.0075}\\_{-0.0049}$. Using this constraint on $\u03c4$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $\u03c4$-$\u03a9\\_m$ plane and find a $2.4\u03c3$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $\u039b$CDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\u03a3m\\_\u03bd<0.0550\\,(0.0717)$ eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, $\u03a3m\\_\u03bd=0.0594\\_{-0.0007}^{+0.0113}$ eV.

Such models are highly predictive, with neutrino masses and the lepton mixing mixing matrix being fixed by three real parameters, as in the Littlest Seesaw Models. We perform an exhaustive scan over all possible models in this class and find many viable fixed points and modular form alignments, after confronting them with the latest neutrino oscillation global fits. The resulting models have the new feature that the two Dirac columns take more general forms than traditional Littlest Seesaw models, resulting in new sum rule relations between the solar and reactor angles, beyond those associated with TM1 (where the first column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix is preserved), which are compared to present and future projected JUNO results.

Realizing this picture is nonetheless challenging, since CMB observations tightly constrain energy injection from dark-matter annihilation at recombination and therefore strongly disfavor simple $s$-wave annihilation into visible Standard-Model final states. In this work, we propose a concrete neutrinophilic framework for sub-GeV thermal dark matter (''light WIMPs'') based on an additional gauge symmetry $\\mathrm{U}(1)\\_{\\mathrm{B}-\\mathrm{L}+x\\mathrm{Y}}$; for an appropriate choice of $x$, the new gauge boson couples predominantly to dark matter and neutrinos while its couplings to charged leptons are suppressed, so that sub-GeV dark matter annihilates almost exclusively into neutrinos, with hadronic modes kinematically closed. We map the parameter space in which the observed relic abundance is reproduced via standard thermal freeze-out in a conventional cosmological history, and show that sizable regions remain viable after imposing current cosmological, indirect-detection, and terrestrial constraints; in part of the allowed parameter space, the dark matter also exhibits sufficiently large self-interactions to potentially alleviate small-scale structure tensions.\n\n", "2601.09224": "2026-01-14, **Spontaneous Cogensis by QCD axion in Type I Seesaw**, Eung Jin Chun et.al., [2601.09224v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09224v1)\n\n We propose a generic axion--driven cogenesis scenario in which both the baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance originate from the kinetic misalignment. The framework unifies the Peccei--Quinn (PQ) mechanism with a Type--I seesaw sector, where Hubble--induced masses and higher-dimensional PQ--violating operators drive early--time axion rotation. Working within the DFSZ axion model augmented by heavy neutrinos, we identify the parametric window of right-handed neutrino masses, determined by its decay rate, and the range of Hubble scales compatible with successful cogenesis, while maintaining the axion solution to the strong CP problem and satisfying current limits on axion isocurvature perturbations.

For heavy neutrino masses below $\\mathcal{O}(1~\\mathrm{TeV})$, production is dominated by the $s$ channel process. At higher masses, vector boson fusion becomes the dominant production mechanism, with cross sections that decrease slowly as the heavy neutrino mass increases. We simulate both signal and Standard Model background events and employ gradient-boosted decision trees to optimize event classification. Assuming an integrated luminosity of $3000~\\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$, expected for the high-luminosity, and considering realistic statistical and systematic uncertainties, we find that heavy neutrinos in the mass range $50~\\mathrm{GeV}$--$10~\\mathrm{TeV}$ can be probed with sensitivity to the mixing parameter $\\|V\\_{\\ell N}\\|^2$ spanning from $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ to 1.

Ring-contact (ring-and-groove) designs address scalability by shaping the electric field to preserve low-capacitance readout, but their nonplanar topology motivates a lithium-contact process that is compatible with conformal deposition and robust high-voltage operation. As a process demonstration toward future ring-contact prototypes, we fabricate and characterize a hybrid-contact planar HPGe device, KL01. Here, ``hybrid'' denotes an $n^{+}$ contact formed by an in-house lithium-suspension paint followed by controlled thermal diffusion, combined with an AJA-developed a-Ge/Al $p^{+}$ contact and a-Ge sidewall passivation.

The phonon mediated sensing of silicon particle absorbers has already been proved with Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), acting both as sensors and athermal phonon absorbers at the same time. In this work we present the design and the performance of an improved detector, where the KID acts only as sensor and is coupled to dedicated phonon collectors. The separation between the detector and the collectors increases the variation of the quasi-particle density within the device, thereby enhancing its responsivity. The meander of the KID is composed of a 77nm trilayer wire of Aluminum-Titanium-Aluminum, while the phonon collectors are made of a 100nm Aluminum layer and act as quasi-particles funnels. Inside the collectors, the absorbed athermal phonons generate quasi-particles which, after diffusion, are trapped in the lower-gap superconducting trilayer. The performance of this setup is compared to that of a standard phonon-mediated KID, showing an increase in responsivity by around a factor of five.\n\n", "2601.08269": "2026-01-13, **Bifurcated Impact of Neutrino Fast Flavor Conversion on Core-collapse Supernovae Informed by Multi-angle Neutrino Radiation Hydrodynamics**, Ryuichiro Akaho et.al., [2601.08269v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08269v1)\n\n In this {\\it Letter}, we present a compelling and robust argument for the roles of neutrino fast flavor conversion (FFC) in the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), combining the {\\it multi-angle} FFC subgrid model rooted in quantum kinetic theory with the multi-dimensional four-species Boltzmann neutrino radiation hydrodynamics. Employing various progenitor masses and the nuclear equations of states, we find that the effect of FFC on CCSN explosion is bifurcated depending on the progenitors. For the lowest-mass progenitor, FFC facilitates the shock revival and enhances the explosion energy, whereas for higher-mass progenitors its impact is inhibitory. We identify the mass accretion rate as the key determinant governing this bifurcation. When the mass accretion rate is low (high), the contribution of FFC to neutrino heating becomes positive (negative), because the heating efficiency enhancement via FFC-driven spectral hardening of electron-type neutrinos dominates over (is outweighed by) the concurrent reduction in neutrino luminosity. Our results further highlight the limitations of approximate neutrino transport, and demonstrate that a multi-angle treatment is essential for accurately capturing FFC effects; otherwise, FFCs are missed and even generated spuriously.\n\n", "2601.08221": "2026-01-13, **Energy and momentum dependence of the soft-axion interaction rate**, Killian Bouzoud et.al., [2601.08221v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08221v1)\n\n Axions coupled to thermal non-Abelian gauge fields may have cosmological significance.

On the theoretical side, ab initio lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations of hadronic vacuum polarization have made remarkable progress. They are now the new standard for studying the leading non-perturbative contributions, which have previously hindered matching with the precision required for full exploitation of the experimental results. The lattice results affected both leading hadronic contributions the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contributions by increasing the previously generally accepted $e^+e^-$ to hadrons based dispersion relation results. The shifts reduced the discrepancy between theory and experiment, leaving nothing missing. One of the most prominent signs of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics has disappeared: the SM appears validated more than ever, in agreement with what other searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN tell us! A triumph of the SM, even though the SM cannot explain known cosmological puzzles like dark matter or baryogenesis, and why neutrino masses are so tiny, the absence of strong CP violation, for example. I also argue that the discrepancy between the data-driven dispersive result and the lattice QCD results for the hadronic vacuum polarization can be largely explained by correcting the $e^+e^-$ data for 'rho-gamma' mixing effects.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2601.09638": "2026-01-14, **Constraining axion-like dark matter with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer**, A.

Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints.\n\n", "2601.08943": "2026-01-13, **Bound Dark Energy: Particle Physics model in alignment with recent DESI cosmological measurements**, Axel de la Macorra et.al., [2601.08943v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08943v1)\n\n We present observational constraints on the Bound Dark Energy Cold Dark Matter (BDE-CDM) model using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements combined with Planck CMB data and Type Ia supernovae compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, DESY5).

We evaluate the accurate expression for the small-scale power responsible for the collapse of the first halos in the presence of the PBH population. The extra power in the matter density field, produced by the granulation term, will cause an earlier collapse of DM halos, populated by PBHs of different masses. In these collapsed and virialized systems the PBHs will undergo 2-body relaxation, driving the more massive PBHs to the halo center under dynamical friction. We quantify this evolution for a distribution of PBH orbital parameters and halo properties. The analysis shows that PBHs can have appropriate mass functions capable of producing systems with parameters similar to what is observed for UHZ1.

Relatively weak-field cases with $B\\_\\mathrm{dip} \\lesssim 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ produce luminous double-peaked UV/optical light curves, as observed in the superluminous SN LSQ14bdq, while stronger-field cases with $B\\_\\mathrm{dip} \\gtrsim 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ result in hypernovae preceded by X-ray blowout precursors. We also examine weaker and lower-mass SN explosions representing ultra-stripped SNe and accretion- or merger-induced collapse events, in which blowout is more readily achieved over a broader range of NS parameters, producing fast X-ray transients with durations of $ 10^{2\\mbox{--}4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and peak luminosities of $10^{42\\mbox{--}48}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$. Our results encourage coordinated UV, optical, and X-ray observations which constrain the formation of the most energetic NSs in the universe.\n\n", "2601.09429": "2026-01-14, **Probing dynamical embeddings in a five-dimensional spacetime in light of DESI BAO**, Abra\u00e3o J. S. Capistrano et.al., [2601.09429v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09429v1)\n\n We here investigate the observational viability of Nash gravity as an alternative to the standard $\u039b$CDM cosmology. Based on Nash's embedding theorem, the model introduces orthogonal perturbations via variations in the extrinsic curvature, generating scalar-type metric perturbations directly from geometry, without the need to introduce additional fields. We confront the model with current observational data, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2, and recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) compilations. Our analysis shows that Nash gravity provides a good fit to the data, yielding a slightly higher value for the Hubble constant, $H\\_0 = 69.32 \\pm 0.72$ km/s/Mpc, compared to the $\u039b$CDM model, thus offering a potential alleviation of the $H\\_0$ tension. Furthermore, the model naturally predicts a suppressed growth of structure, with $S\\_8 \\approx 0.76$ across various joint analyses, potentially alleviating the so-called $S\\_8$ tension, assuming that this discrepancy is not solely due to systematic effects in other independent measurements.

For an extended Higgs-like scalar self-interaction, we find that the resulting field equations belong to the damped Ermakov-Painlev\u00e9 II class and construct novel analytical solutions within the framework of the Chiellini integrability condition. We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities.

Van Dyk et.al., [2601.09087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09087v1)\n\n We provide a characterization of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby Type II-plateau supernova (SN) 2025pht in NGC 1637. The star was first detectable in 2001 by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and then again in a dozen bands by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2024. This \"quasi-snapshot\" of the star's nature almost immediately prior to explosion is unprecedented. The RSG varied in brightness, and we posit that it could have been a pulsating variable, possibly with a long period of ~660 days. The largest uncertainty is the host-galaxy distance, which we establish to be 10.73+/-1.76 Mpc. The star was also heavily extinguished by interstellar dust internal to the host, with visual extinction A\\_V(host)~1.7 mag (total A\\_V(tot)~1.8 mag). Dust radiative-transfer modeling reveals the star's circumstellar medium to be quite dusty and silicate-rich, yielding a bolometric luminosity log(L\\_bol/L\\_Sun)=5.08+/-0.16 and a cool effective temperature T\\_eff=2100--2500 K. The available HST optical data had no bearing on the shape of the candidate's observed spectral energy distribution -- for the first time, without the archival JWST observations we would not have been able to detect and characterize the candidate at all.

For the lowest-mass model (9 $M\\_\\odot$), the ejecta mass ($M\\_{\\rm ej}$) scales with the energy gained by the H-rich envelope via a power law (index$\\sim$3.5). Across 9-10 $M\\_\\odot$, this relation shows limited scatter within a factor of $\\sim$2.6, enabling an estimation of the gained energy from $M\\_{\\rm ej}$. The shock passage also flattens the bound envelope, which can affect the SN light curve morphology and provide another diagnostic for the eruption. Then, we compute the associated precursor light curves for the 9 $M\\_\\odot$ model with the multi-group radiative-transfer code \\texttt{STELLA}.

In BDE-CDM, dark energy originates from the lightest meson field within a supersymmetric SU(3) dark gauge group with $N\\_f = 6$ flavors, governed by an inverse power-law potential $V(\u03c6) = \u039b\\_{c}^{4+2/3} \u03c6^{-2/3}$. Unlike $\u039b$CDM and $w\\_0w\\_a$CDM, the dark energy sector contains no free parameters -- the condensation scale $\u039b\\_c$ and transition epoch $a\\_c$ are determined by gauge coupling unification constraints. The equation of state evolves from relativistic behavior ($w = 1/3$) before condensation through a kinetic-dominated stiff phase ($w \\simeq 1$), approaching $w\\_0 = -0.9298 \\pm 0.0003$ at present, with $w > -1$ maintained throughout cosmic history, avoiding phantom-regime instabilities.

Fox et.al., [2601.08931v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08931v1)\n\n Transient astronomy in the early Universe (z > 2) remains largely unexplored, lying beyond the rest-frame optical spectroscopic reach of most current observatories. Yet this regime promises transformative insights, with high-redshift transients providing direct access to the early Universe and enabling studies of how stellar populations and cosmology evolve over cosmic time. JWST is uniquely equipped to probe these redshifts efficiently in the rest-frame optical and near-IR. We present results from an initial pathfinder search, covering an area of ~133 arcmin^2 (~0.037 deg^2) independently imaged by the PRIMER and COSMOS-Web (hereafter COSMOS) extragalactic surveys. Although neither program was designed for time-domain astronomy, combining their data results in difference images separated by roughly one year, leading to the discovery of 68 supernovae (SNe) with host photometric redshifts reaching z < 5. For most SNe, only a single epoch is available, but the combination of host redshift, classification, color, and magnitude enables us to prioritize candidates for detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. Among the most notable sources are a relatively bright, blue CCSN at z > 3 (SN 2023aeab) and a young, normal SN Ia at z > 2 (SN 2023aeax). The sample distribution highlights the increasing likelihood that a wide-area JWST program can uncover younger, bluer, and potentially more extreme explosions. While this pathfinder effort is limited in cadence and number of filters, it demonstrates the strong potential of a dedicated, well-planned time-domain survey with JWST to obtain the sample sizes and rate measurements needed to chart SN populations deep into the early Universe.\n\n", "2601.08903": "2026-01-13, **IK Pegasi and the Double Merger Path to Type Ia Supernovae**, Na'ama Hallakoun et.al., [2601.08903v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08903v1)\n\n Recent Gaia astrometry has revealed thousands of main-sequence + white-dwarf binaries (MS+WD) at separations of ~0.1-10 au, including a subset hosting unusually massive (>~0.8 Msun) WDs. We argue that s-process enrichment in the non-degenerate companion provides a powerful diagnostic for identifying WDs that formed via mergers in hierarchical triple systems. For a massive WD, standard single-star evolution requires a massive (>~4 Msun) progenitor, yet such progenitors produce negligible s-process yields. We define IK Peg-type systems as those exhibiting this mass-yield tension: barium-enhanced companions orbiting WDs too massive to have descended from efficient s-process producers. The well-known system IK Peg exemplifies this class. Applying this framework to published spectroscopic data reveals several additional candidates, and we estimate that a few dozen such systems should exist in the current Gaia sample. If these systems trace inner-binary mergers in primordial triples, they represent observable intermediate stages towards eventual Type Ia supernovae via the double-merger pathway, as predicted by recent population-synthesis models.\n\n", "2601.08550": "2026-01-13, **Reconstructing Gamma Ray Burst Energy Relations with Observational H(z) data in Neural Network Framework**, Nilanjana Bagchi Aurpa et.al., [2601.08550v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08550v1)\n\n Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful probe of the cosmic expansion history far beyond the redshift range accessible to Type Ia supernovae. However, the calibration of GRB luminosity correlations is hindered by the circularity problem, which arises from assuming a fiducial cosmological model during calibration. In this work, we perform a model independent calibration of GRB luminosity relations using observational Hubble parameter H(z) data from the A220 and J220 compilations, thereby avoiding explicit cosmological assumptions. We employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct the calibration relation directly from the data. In addition, we implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) framework as an alternative approach, enabling a data driven treatment of both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The calibrated GRB sample is used to constrain the Amati relation, and we systematically compare the outcomes obtained from different calibration techniques and datasets. While the Amati Parameters obtained from GRBs caibrated from the ANN and BNN results are consistent with previous low redshifts calibrations using model-independent methods, the BNN approach provides a more robust framework.\n\n", "2601.08505": "2026-01-13, **A new magnitude--redshift relation based on SNe Ia**, \u00d3smar Rodr\u00edguez et.al., [2601.08505v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08505v1)\n\n We present a new empirical relation between the standardized magnitude ($m$) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and redshift ($z$).

This relation corresponds to the luminosity distance $d\\_L(z)=c\\,H\\_0^{-1}z(1+z)10^{bz/5}$ and is valid up to at least $z\\simeq1.1$.

Furthermore, the relation is stable in the absence of low-$z$ SNe, making it suitable for fitting Hubble diagrams of SNe Ia without the need to add a low-$z$ sample. In deep fields in particular, assuming that the large-scale density is independent of the comoving radial coordinate, $b\\propto q\\_0+1$.

Using a multi-component analytical model that incorporates the diffuse warm ionized medium together with localized H II regions, supernova remnants (SNR), and stellar-wind bubbles (SWB), we derive location-dependent coefficients governing KA dispersion and nonlinearity. The reductive perturbation method is applied to obtain Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, enabling the characterization of solitons under realistic astrophysical conditions. Numerical analysis demonstrates how superthermality, plasma $\u03b2$, temperature, and density gradients modulate soliton amplitude, width, and stability. Our results reveal distinct exclusion zones (EZs) for KA solitons in high-$\u03b2$ HII regions and SWB/SNR interiors, as well as ultra low-$\u03b2$ regions near central pulsar wind nebulae. While H II regions exhibit simple Gaussian-driven depletions, the complex ``hole-and-shell\" morphologies of SWBs and SNRs imprint sharp spatial variations and discontinuities on soliton properties. This study establishes a direct link between macroscopic ISM morphology, ion-kinetic scale dissipation, and the emergence of coherent Alfv\u00e9nic activity, with implications for radio scattering, pulsar scintillation, and fine-scale signatures in astrophysical observations.\n\n"}}
