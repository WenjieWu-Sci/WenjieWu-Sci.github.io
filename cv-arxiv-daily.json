We derive, for the first time, analytical expressions for the asymptotic state resulting from a homogeneous and isotropic instability, and apply these predictions to two representative conditions from a neutron star merger simulation. We emphasize the importance of using a collision term that allows for both damping of flavor coherence and relaxation back to thermal equilibrium, which leads to a \"quantum\" equilibrium with nonzero coherence.

The DeepCore sub-detector lowers the detection energy threshold to a few GeV, enabling the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters with atmospheric neutrinos. The reconstruction of neutrino interactions inside the detector is essential in studying neutrino oscillations. It is particularly challenging to reconstruct sub-100 GeV events with the IceCube detectors due to the relatively sparse detection units and detection medium. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are broadly used in physics experiments for both classification and regression purposes.

We adopt a phenomenological approach that allows us to parametrize the energy dependence of the decoherence effects resulting from the modification of the neutrino dispersion relation. Using the open quantum system framework we derive decoherence parameters, which are usually connected to quantum gravitational effects. Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of decoherence on high-energy astrophysical neutrinos among all possible initial source compositions. We find that variation in the flux composition at neutrino telescopes can be a good probe to test such effects. Additionally, we show that a simple extension with heavy sterile neutrino decoherence produces verifiable signatures.\n\n", "2505.16153": "2025-05-22, **Model-Independent Measurement of the Matter-Radiation Equality Scale in DESI 2024**, B.

This scale can serve as a standard ruler, independent of other features in the matter power spectrum, such as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Here, we present the first detection of the turnover in the galaxy auto-power spectrum, utilising the distribution of quasars (QSO) and luminous red galaxies (LRG) measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) during its first year of survey operations in a model-independent manner. To avoid confirmation bias, we first analyse the data using data blinding methods designed for the DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, redshift space distortion and scale-dependent bias signals. We measure the angle-averaged dilation distance $D\\_V(z = 1.651) = (38.1\\pm 2.5)r\\_H$ from the quasars and $D\\_{V}(z = 0.733) = (21.8\\pm 1.0)r\\_H$ from the LRG sample in units of the horizon $r\\_H$ at the matter-radiation-equality epoch.

Unfortunately, an unknown source of phonon bursts (the low energy excess, or ``LEE'') both dominates all other above threshold background sources and produces shot noise from sub-threshold bursts which greatly exceeds all fundamental noise sources. In this paper, we measure these phonon bursts for 12 days after cool down in two nearly identical multi-phonon sensor channel 1cm$^2$ silicon detectors which differ only in the thickness of their substrate (1 mm vs 4 mm thick). We find that both the correlated shot noise and near threshold shared LEE relax with time since cooldown. Additionally, we show that both shot noise and LEE rates scale linearly with substrate thickness. When combined with previous measurements of other silicon phonon detectors with different substrate geometries and mechanical support strategies, these measurements strongly suggest that the dominant source of both above and below threshold LEE is the bulk substrate. By monitoring the relation between bias power and excess phonon shot noise we estimate that $\\varepsilon = \\frac{<E^2>}{<E>}$ for sub-threshold noise events is $0.68 \\pm 0.38$ meV.

The usual ITM with an extended scalar sector offers a DM candidate along with novel signatures at different experiments, e.g., colliders, gravitational wave detectors, etc. Nevertheless, hitherto unseen experimental detections have placed stringent constraints on the ITM parameter space. Moreover, triplet masses lighter than $1.9$ TeV, consistent with the existing or upcoming collider sensitivity reach, are already excluded from the DM observable, as they yield an underabundant relic density due to a strong $SU(2)\\_L$ gauge annihilation. Inclusion of a pNGB DM, via a complex $SU(2)\\_L$ scalar singlet and through the soft-breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry, helps to revive the sub-TeV regime of the triplet DM. This resurgence relies on a proficient conversion between the two DM species.

The number of stars having a dark matter halo outside the hadronic matter surface increases with an increase in dark matter fraction and the stiffness of the dark matter equation of state.

We establish a dictionary of correspondence between the WKB wave functions in General Relativity and Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory in the large-scale factor (or IR) limit.

Here, we present a fast deep-learning framework, leveraging Transformer and normalizing flows, that maps GW-event posterior samples to joint posterior distributions over the hyperparameters of the PBH population. Our approach yields accurate credible intervals while reducing end-to-end inference time to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ s on a single GPU. These results underscore the potential of deep learning for fast, high-accurately PBH population studies in the era of next-generation GW detectors.\n\n", "2505.15448": "2025-05-21, **Constraining scalar-tensor theories from higher harmonics with GW230529**, Baoxiang Wang et.al., [2505.15448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15448v1)\n\n The Advanced LIGO and Virgo collaborations recently detected a gravitational wave event, GW230529\\\\_181500, during the fourth observing run, which is most plausibly attributed to the merger of a neutron star and a black hole. This observation provides an opportunity to test a class of gravitational theories that deviate from general relativity. In such theories, additional terms contribute to the gravitational wave signal only in cases of asymmetric binaries. This study focuses on two scalar-tensor models within this class of theories: the Screened Modified Gravity and Brans-Dicke theory. These models have potential applications in areas such as dark matter, dark energy, cosmic inflation, and primordial nucleosynthesis. With the GW230529\\\\_181500 and Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo analyses, we derive a 90\\% credible lower bound as $ \\frac{\\varphi\\_{\\rm\\_{VEV}}}{M\\_{\\rm Pl}}<1.7\\times10^{-2}$ and $\\omega\\_{\\rm BD}>25.12$ by using dominant-mode correction.

Contrary to previous Newtonian treatments, our analysis reveals that PBH masses can increase by an order of magnitude before evaporation, leading to substantial modifications of their lifetime and cosmological imprints. We quantify the resulting shifts in the minimum PBH mass constrained by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the revised lower bound for PBHs surviving today, and the dark matter parameter space allowed by PBH evaporation. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced accretion alters the high-frequency gravitational wave spectrum from PBH evaporation, potentially within the reach of future detectors.

The abundance of Milky Way subhalos depends on the mass of WDM particles, allowing constraints to be obtained by comparing observations and theoretical models. However, high-resolution simulations of heavier WDM particle masses are computationally demanding, making semi-analytical approaches valuable. In this study, we evaluate the ability of the Semi-Analytical Sub-Halo Inference Modeling for WDM (SASHIMI-W) to reproduce subhalo mass functions for heavier WDM particle masses. We perform high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations for CDM and WDM with particle masses of 1 keV, 3 keV, and 10 keV, and compare the ratio of the subhalo mass function between WDM and CDM cases. Our results show that SASHIMI-W successfully reproduces the simulation results over redshifts z = 0 to z = 2. Furthermore, both simulations and the semi-analytical model show a slight redshift dependence in the subhalo suppression ratio. However, a direct comparison of the differential subhalo mass functions shows discrepancies in the mid- and low-mass regions, suggesting that the tidal stripping effects implemented in SASHIMI-W may be too strong for WDM subhalos, or that the removal of spurious subhalos in the simulations is insufficient. These results validate the use of SASHIMI-W in constraining WDM properties, and highlight the need for refinements in both tidal effect modeling and spurious subhalo filtering to improve subhalo abundance predictions.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2505.15975": "2025-05-21, **Geometric formulation of $k$-essence and late-time acceleration**, Lehel Csillag et.al., [2505.15975v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15975v1)\n\n We study a class of geometries in which nonmetricity is fully determined by a vectorial degree of freedom and three independent coefficients. Formulating the simplest linear action in this geometry, implemented through Lagrange multipliers, naturally leads to an equivalence with the purely kinetic $k$-essence models with quadratic kinetic terms. A detailed dynamical systems analysis reveals that the $\\Lambda$CDM phenomenology is embedded within the model. Crucially, we find that if stability conditions such as a positive sound speed squared and non-negative energy density are not enforced, the model generically exhibits instabilities and divergent behaviour in the phase space. These physical viability criteria allow us to isolate stable regions of the parameter space and derive well-motivated priors for parameter inference. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and late-time observational data, including cosmic chronometers, Pantheon$^{+}$ Type Ia supernovae, and DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, we constrain the degrees of freedom associated with nonmetricity and demonstrate the viability of the model. Remarkably, the model is found to be statistically indistinguishable from $\\Lambda$CDM at late times. We discuss the implications of these results in light of the recent cosmic tensions, and give a possible explanation as to why the equivalent $k$-essence models have been missed as serious competitors to $\\Lambda$CDM in the past.

In frameworks such as the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the relationship between the luminosity distance ($D\\_{\\text{L}}$) and the angular diameter distance ($D\\_{\\text{A}}$), namely the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), is expected to deviate from $\\eta(z) \\equiv D\\_{\\text{L}}(z)/D\\_{\\text{A}}(z) = (1+z)^{2}$, making it a powerful probe of a potential variation of such a fundamental constant. Hence, we test the viability of the meVSL model through the CDDR by comparing $D\\_{\\text{A}}$ measurements, provided by the transverse (2D) and anisotropic (3D) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations from different surveys, like SDSS, DES and DESI, in combination with $D\\_{\\text{L}}$ measurements from Pantheon+ type Ia Supernova (SNe) compilation. The Gaussian Process reconstruction is employed on the SN data to match $D\\_{\\text{A}}$ with $D\\_{\\text{L}}$ at the same redshift. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2$\\sigma$ confidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined together, as well as when considering SNe with 3D BAO only. However, when SNe and 2D BAO only are considered, the standard CDDR is only recovered at $\\sim 4\\sigma$ confidence level. However, such a result might be due to some recently discussed tensions between SN and BAO datasets, especially at low redshifts, in addition to possible inconsistencies between the BAO datasets individually. Therefore, our results show no significant evidence in favour of the meVSL model, once these potential systematics are taken into account.\n\n", "2505.15691": "2025-05-21, **Stellar population modelling of neutron stars and black holes: spatially-resolved graveyards in MaNGA/SDSS-IV galaxies**, Claudia Maraston et.al., [2505.15691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15691v1)\n\n We update our stellar population models for the time evolution of the number and mass of massive remnants - neutron stars and black holes - with a new initial mass-remnant mass relation for core collapse supernovae. The calculations are based on hydrodynamical simulations and induced explosions of a subset of previously published pre-supernovae models spanning a wide range of stellar mass, metallicity and different values for rotation velocity. The resulting stellar population models predict lower numbers of neutron stars (by up to 0.3 dex) and higher numbers of black holes (by up to 0.8 dex), especially when stellar rotation is considered. The mass fraction locked in neutron stars and black holes is lowest in high-metallicity populations, with the largest number of remnants found at about half-solar metallicity. This mirrors the amount of available gas, ranging from 35 per cent to 45 per cent. We then apply our new models to IFU spectra for ~10,000 galaxies from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey for which we previously published spatially-resolved star formation histories. This allows us to probe spatially-resolved graveyards in galaxies of different types. The number and radial distribution of remnants depend on a galaxy's mass, star formation history and metal content. More massive and hence more metal-rich galaxies are found to host fewer remnants. Radial gradients in the number of remnants depend on galaxy mass mostly because of the mass-dependent profiles in mass density: the gradients are flat in low-mass galaxies, and negative in high-mass galaxies, particularly in Milky Way analogues.\n\n", "2505.15614": "2025-05-21, **Implementation of CR Energy SPectrum (CRESP) algorithm in PIERNIK MHD code.

We extend the algorithm to several CR nuclei and demonstrate our code's capability to model primary and secondary CR species simultaneously. Primary C, N, and O are accelerated in supernova (SN) remnants. In contrast, the spallation collisions of the primary nuclei against the thermal ISM protons lead to secondary Li, Be, and B products. All the CR species evolve according to the momentum-dependent Fokker-Planck equations that are dynamically coupled to the MHD system of equations governing the evolution of the ISM. We demonstrate the operation of this system in the gravity-stratified box, reproducing the Milky Way conditions in the Sun's local environment. We perform a parameter study by investigating the impact of the SN rate, CR parallel diffusion coefficient $D\\_\\parallel$, and the rigidity-dependent diffusion coefficient power index $\\delta$. A novel result of our investigation is that the Secondary to Primary flux ratio \\BtoC grows when the diffusion coefficient grows, due to the weaker vertical magnetic field resulting from CR buoyancy effects. Moreover, a higher SN rate leads to lower values of \\BtoC because of stronger winds and the shorter residence of primary CR particles in dense disk regions.\n\n"}}
