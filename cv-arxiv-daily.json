However, these analyses approximate the neutrino mass hierarchy by three degenerate-mass (DM) neutrinos, instead of the normal (NH) and inverted hierarchies (IH) informed by terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. Given the stringency of the upper limits from DESI data, we test explicitly whether the inferred neutrino constraints are robust to the choice of neutrino mass ordering using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. For Planck data alone, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies while showing a strong dependence on the assumed lower bound of the prior, confirming previous studies. For the combined Planck and DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find that assuming NH ($M\\_\\mathrm{tot} < 0.13\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) or IH ($M\\_\\mathrm{tot} < 0.16\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) loosens the Bayesian upper limits compared to the DM approximation ($M\\_\\mathrm{tot} < 0.086\\,\\mathrm{eV}$). The frequentist analysis shows that the different neutrino models fit the data equally well and the loosening of the constraints can thus be attributed to the lower bounds induced by NH and IH. Overall, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies also for Planck+DESI data as long as the corresponding lower neutrino mass bounds are imposed.\n\n", "2412.03311": "2024-12-04, **Scalar sector of Type 2 Seesaw model explorations with multi-lepton final states**, C\u0103lin Alexa et.al., [2412.03311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03311v1)\n\n Originally motivated for the generation of (Majorana) neutrino masses, the Type 2 Seesaw Model has also a rich extended Higgs sector with, if accessible at the LHC, a distinctive phenomenology of neutral, charged and doubly-charged states. The goal of the work is to present an exhaustive phenomenological study of the most promising production and decay channels of pair or associated scalars, decaying directly or in cascades to Standard Model particles at the LHC. The study is complementary to the literature in that it highlights a previously unnoticed important sensitivity to a mixing angle. The ensuing uncertainty calls for a comprehensive experimental search strategy for the various processes. These processes can be studied within LHC energies reach, by comparing cutflow results for different final states. We carried out prospective search analyses with multi-lepton, jets and missing energy configurations, assuming an ATLAS-like detector at LHC and HL-LHC, for charged, doubly-charged, and for the first time neutral scalar productions. The work is a collaboration between ATLAS experimentalists and theoreticians in continuation of an endeavor that lead to previous published ATLAS analyses for the search of (doubly)charged Higgs bosons, aiming at proposals for future experimental searches.\n\n", "2412.03260": "2024-12-04, **Quantum Correlations in Neutrino and Neutral Meson Oscillations**, Subhashish Banerjee et.al., [2412.03260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03260v1)\n\n We discuss the impact of ideas of open quantum systems and quantum information to various facets of neutrino and neutral meson oscillations.

We study the active-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moment through this upscattering in the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process induced by solar neutrinos. We place new limits on the transition magnetic moment-sterile neutrino mass plane using the latest data from the CDEX-10 experiment. We also provide projected sensitivities for future measurements.

This represents an essential test of the thermal freezeout paradigm. This raises the question: what viable UV-complete models are there in which dark matter annihilates dominantly to neutrinos? We discuss models that fulfill this criteria, and are invariant under the Standard Model gauge group, for both scalar and fermionic dark matter. Specifically, we construct new models in which annihilation via the $s$-channel exchange of a scalar or pseudoscalar mediator achieves the correct relic density. In these models, dark matter is stabilised by an exact or a softly-broken lepton-number symmetry.

Recent observations of the radio pulsar GLEAM-X J1627 suggest it may have a surface field as strong as $10^{16} \\,\\rm G$. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, the energy levels of electrons and protons are quantized and the Direct Urca process allows neutron stars to cool rapidly, even at low density. For the case of magnetic fields $B \\geq 10^{16}\\,\\rm G$, we find features in the emissivity due to energy quantization that are not captured by the frequently employed quasiclassical approximation where energy levels are treated as nearly continuous. Resonances can result in amplification of the neutrino emissivity at specific densities compared to a calculation that neglects quantization, particularly at low temperature. These effects are not important for the thermal evolution of an entire neutron star, but may be relevant for phenomena that depend on behavior at specific densities. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the Direct Urca rate in a strong magnetic field using the standard V-A weak Lagrangian incorporating mean field nuclear effects and discuss approaches to the numerical challenge the modified wavefunctions present and a new semi-analytic approximation. These tools are also applicable to calculating neutrino opacities in strong magnetic fields in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. We calculate the opacities for neutrinos capturing on free nucleons at sub-saturation densities and temperatures exceeding an MeV. We find an enhancement to capture processes of the lowest energy neutrinos by an order of magnitude or more due to suppression of electron Pauli blocking in the case of capture on neutrons, and from the effect of the nucleon magnetic moments in the case of capture on protons.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2412.03547": "2024-12-04, **Learning from galactic rotation curves: a neural network approach**, Bihag Dave et.al., [2412.03547v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03547v1)\n\n For a galaxy, given its observed rotation curve, can one directly infer parameters of the dark matter density profile (such as dark matter particle mass $m$, scaling parameter $s$, core-to-envelope transition radius $r\\_t$ and NFW scale radius $r\\_s$), along with Baryonic parameters (such as the stellar mass-to-light ratio $\\Upsilon\\_*$)?

We employ two different methods to quantify uncertainties in the estimated parameters, and compare the results with those obtained using Bayesian methods.

A key component of semi-numerical models of reionization is the collapse fraction field $f\\_{\\text{coll}}(\\mathbf{x})$, which represents the fraction of mass within dark matter halos at each location. Using high-dynamic range N-body simulations to obtain this is computationally prohibitive and semi-analytical approaches, while being fast, end up compromising on accuracy. In this work, we bridge the gap by developing a machine learning model that can generate $f\\_{\\text{coll}}$ maps by sampling from the full distribution of $f\\_{\\text{coll}}$ conditioned on the dark matter density contrast $\\delta$. The conditional distribution functions and the input density field to the model are taken from low-dynamic range N-body simulations that are more efficient to run. We evaluate the performance of our ML model by comparing its predictions to a high-dynamic range N-body simulation. Using these $f\\_{\\text{coll}}$ maps, we compute the HI and HII maps through a semi-numerical code for reionization.

We define the web as the unique, fully connected, percolating object with (unsmoothed) matter density everywhere exceeding 5.25 times the cosmic mean.

As a result, web galaxies have systematically lower specific star-formation rates (sSFR's) than non-web galaxies. For the latter, the distributions of stellar mass and sSFR are almost independent of web distance. Furthermore, for both central and satellite galaxies, the sSFR distributions at given stellar mass are identical in and outside the web, once differences in backsplash fraction are accounted for. For the galaxy formation model considered here, differences between web and non-web galaxy populations are almost entirely due to the difference in halo mass distribution between the two environments.\n\n", "2412.03432": "2024-12-04, **Self-interactions of ultralight spinless dark matter to the rescue?**, Gaurav Goswami et.al., [2412.03432v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03432v1)\n\n Numerous observations on astrophysical and cosmological scales can be interpreted to mean that, in addition to the familiar kind of matter well described by the standard model of elementary particle physics, there exists Dark Matter (DM). The fundamental properties of the elementary particles which make up the DM e.g. particle mass, spin, couplings etc are currently being observationally constrained. In particular, if DM particles have spin zero, there exist recent constraints which suggest a lower limit on its mass which is often a couple of orders of magnitude larger than $10^{-22}$ eV. In this talk, we will (a) argue that these limits are based on the assumption that the self coupling of the spinless DM particles is negligible, and, (b) show how some of these lower limits will get modified in the presence of incredibly feeble self interactions.\n\n", "2412.03406": "2024-12-04, **The Outskirt Stellar Mass of Low-Redshift Massive Galaxies is an Excellent Halo Mass Proxy in Illustris/IllustrisTNG Simulations**, Shuo Xu et.al., [2412.03406v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03406v1)\n\n Recent observations suggest that the extended stellar halos of low-redshift massive galaxies are tightly connected to the assembly of their dark matter halos.

Two different kinds of sources of $e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to massive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple low-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double power-law model $S\\_{nth} =S\\_{DM}(\\frac {\\nu}{\\nu\\_{\\star}})^{-\\alpha\\_{DM}}+S\\_{CR}( \\frac {\\nu}{\\nu\\_{\\star}})^{-\\alpha\\_{CR}} $. $\\nu\\_{\\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and $S\\_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\\mu m$ luminosity based on the global radio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\\alpha\\_{CR}$ changing from $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\\alpha\\_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given a fixed value of $\\alpha\\_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron emission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies. Larger value of $\\alpha\\_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from cosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\\alpha\\_{DM}$ and allow less synchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency. Under the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the frequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as the peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of $e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more severe in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey should be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.\n\n", "2412.03100": "2024-12-04, **Formation of Transitional cE/UCD Galaxies through Massive/Dwarf Disc Galaxy Mergers**, Alexander V.

The remnant of such interaction after numerous crossings of the satellite through the disc of the main galaxy is a compact stellar core, the characteristics of which are close to small compact elliptical galaxies (cEs) or large ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs). Such transitional cE/UCD objects with an effective radius of 100-200 pc arise as a result of stripping the outer layers of the stellar core during the destruction of a disc dwarf galaxy. Numerical models of the satellite before interaction include baryonic matter (stars and gas) and dark mass. We use N-body to describe the dynamics of stars and dark matter and Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics to model the gas components of both galaxies. The direct method of calculating the gravitational force between all particles provides a qualitative resolution of spatial structures up to 10 pc. The simulated cE/UCD galaxies contain very little gas and dark matter at the end of their evolution.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2412.03509": "2024-12-04, **Signatures of the Shock Interaction as an Additional Power Source in the Nebular Spectra of SN 2023ixf**, Amit Kumar et.al., [2412.03509v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03509v1)\n\n Red supergiants may lose significant mass through steady winds and episodic eruptions in the final 100-1000 years before the core collapses, shaping their circumstellar environment. Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and distant circumstellar material (CSM) can generate shocks, which can energize the ejecta and serve as a key power source during the nebular phase of the SN. In the present work, we investigate the nebular spectrum of SN 2023ixf, observed one year post-explosion (at +363 d) with the recently commissioned WEAVE instrument on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. This marks the first supernova spectrum captured with WEAVE. In this spectrum, H$\\alpha$ exhibits a peculiar evolution, flanked by blueward and redward broad components centred at $\\sim\\pm 5650\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ from the rest velocity of H$\\alpha$, which are seen for only a few SNe to date.

The essence of the dynamical code is in including the fact that the ejecta does not leave the system instantaneously. We find that the final separation velocity between the centers of masses of the two WDs' ejecta is ~80% of the pre-explosion WDs' orbital velocity, i.e., we find separation velocities of 4200-5400 km/s for two WDs of masses M1=M2=0.94 Mo. The lower separation velocities we find challenge scenarios with two exploding WDs to explain bimodal emission line profiles with observed velocity separations of up to ~7000 km/s. Only the mass in the ejecta of one WD with an explosion velocity lower than the separation velocity contributes to one peak of the bimodal profile; this is the inner ejecta. We find the inner ejecta to be only <15% of the ejecta mass in energetic explosions. Less energetic explosions yield higher inner mass but lower separation velocities. We encourage searching for alternative explanations of bimodal line profiles.\n\n"}}
