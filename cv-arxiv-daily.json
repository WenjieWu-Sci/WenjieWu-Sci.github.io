Cosentino et.al., [2503.03699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03699v1)\n\n In hydrogen-rich (H-rich) Supernova (SN) events, the collision between the H-rich ejecta and the Circum-Stellar Medium (CSM) can accelerate particles and produce high-energy neutrinos (HE-$\\nu$, TeV-PeV) through proton-proton inelastic scattering. Despite understanding the production mechanism of these neutrinos, the lack of direct observations raises questions about particle acceleration efficiency and the involved astrophysical conditions. This study focuses on neutrino emission from H-rich SNe with low-mass CSM, such as SN 2023ixf. We developed a semi-analytical model to characterize the progenitor and CSM at the explosion time, allowing us to infer the expected neutrino flux at Earth during the SN's interaction phase. Our model shows that neutrino emission depends not only on shock velocity and CSM mass but also on the spatial matter distribution of the CSM. By analysing the bolometric light curve of SN 2023ixf beyond 100 days post-explosion, we find that its ejecta, consisting of $9\\,\\text{M}\\_{\\rm \\odot}$ (including $0.07\\,\\text{M}\\_{\\rm \\odot}$ of radioactive $^{56}$Ni) and having a kinetic energy of $1.8\\,\\text{foe}$, collides with a low-mass CSM of $0.06\\,\\text{M}\\_{\\rm \\odot}$ distributed according to a power-law density profile with an exponent of $s=2.9$. Through these parameters, we estimate that up to $4\\pm1\\times 10^{-2}$ muon (anti-)neutrino events could be detected by IceCube within 50 days post-explosion. Although the predicted flux ($\\lesssim 3\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{GeV} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$) is below current IceCube sensitivity, future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT could detect HE-$\\nu$ from similar SN events.\n\n", "2503.03610": "2025-03-05, **Identifying multiplets of IceCube alert events**, Martina Karl et.al., [2503.03610v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03610v1)\n\n The IceCube Neutrino Observatory publishes \"alert events\", i.e. detections of high-energy neutrinos with a moderate-to-high probability of being of astrophysical origin. While some events are produced in the atmosphere, a fraction of alert events should point back to their astrophysical sources. We aim to identify multiple alert events possibly related to a single astrophysical counterpart by searching for spatial and temporal clusterings in 13 years of alert data. We identify spatial clusters (\"multiplets\") by checking for events overlapping within their uncertainty regions. In order to reduce chance coincidences and to improve the signal purity of our sample, we apply different thresholds. We investigate the weighted mean position of these multiplets for an over-fluctuation of gamma-ray counterparts. As a final step, we apply expectation maximization to search for temporal clusters around the identified weighted mean positions. We find no statistically significant clustering of alert events around a specific origin direction or in time. This could be because the selections are still dominated by atmospheric background. Another possibility is that we are not yet sensitive enough and only detect single events from sources. In this case, we need more data in order to observe a clustering of events around their origin.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2503.03683": "2025-03-05, **First Limits on Light Dark Matter Interactions in a Low Threshold Two Channel Athermal Phonon Detector from the TESSERACT Collaboration**, C.

Fahrion et.al., [2503.03404v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03404v1)\n\n The ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) NGC1052-DF2 has captured the interest of astronomers ever since the low velocity dispersion measured from ten globular clusters (GCs) suggested a low dark matter fraction. Also, its GC system was found to be unusually bright, with a peak of the GC luminosity function at least one magnitude brighter than expected for a galaxy at a distance of 20 Mpc. In this work, we present an updated view of the GC system of NGC1052-DF2. We analysed archival MUSE data of NGC1052-DF2 to confirm the membership of four additional GCs based on their radial velocities, thereby raising the number of spectroscopically confirmed GCs to 16. We measured the ages and metallicities of eleven individual GCs, finding them to be old ($> 9$ Gyr) with a range of metallicities from [M/H] = $-0.7$ to $-1.8$ dex. The majority of GCs are found to be more metal-poor than the host galaxy, with some metal-rich GCs sharing the metallicity of the host ([M/H] = $-$1.09$^{+0.09}\\_{-0.07}$ dex). The host galaxy shows a flat age and metallicity gradient out to 1 $R\\_\\text{e}$. Using a distance measurement based on the internal GC velocity dispersions ($D = 16.2$ Mpc; Beasley et al. 2025), we derived photometric GC masses and found that the peak of the GC mass function compares well with that of the Milky Way. From updated GC velocities, we estimated the GC system velocity dispersion of NGC1052-DF2 with a simple kinematic model and found $\\sigma\\_\\text{GCS} = 14.86^{+3.89}\\_{-2.83}$ km s$^{-1}$. However, this value is reduced to $\\sigma\\_\\text{GCS} = 8.63^{+2.88}\\_{-2.14}$ km s$^{-1}$, when the one GC that has the highest relative velocity based on a low S/N spectrum is considered as an interloper.

If such PBHs exist, they could be captured by stars in DM-dominated environments with low velocity dispersion such as ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). The capture probability increases with the stellar mass, and captured PBHs would rapidly destroy their host stars. As a result, the presence of PBHs in UFDs would alter their stellar mass functions. Using photometric observations of three ultra-faint dwarf galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope, we show that it is unlikely that their mass functions have been significantly modified by PBHs, and we place constraints on the PBH abundance. In the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Triangulum II, PBHs around $10^{19}$g are excluded at the $2\\sigma$ ($3\\sigma$) level from constituting more than $\\sim55\\%$ ($\\sim78\\%$) of the dark matter, while the possibility that PBHs represent the entirety of the DM is excluded at the $3.7\\sigma$ level.\n\n", "2503.03293": "2025-03-05, **Fast and Precise Spectral Analysis for Dark Matter Searches with LIGO**, Alexandre G\u00f6ttel et.al., [2503.03293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03293v1)\n\n We introduce a novel logarithmic spectral estimation method for dark matter searches using gravitational-wave detectors, integrating established dark matter search techniques with insights from computer music analysis. By leveraging symmetries between the time and frequency domains, this method matches the computational efficiency of FFT based algorithms without, unlike such algorithms, compromising precision. We apply this approach to data from LIGO's third observing run, directly comparing its performance with that of a previous search. Our results show a consistent 15 percent improvement across nearly the entire frequency range, without additional computational costs.

The dynamical system $(x(z),p(z))$ can be integrated for a known set of equation of state parameters for different matter/energy components. However, to avoid any preference for specific dark energy models, we adopt a cosmographic approach. We consider two scenarios where the Luminosity distance is expanded as Pad\\'e rational approximants using expansion in terms of $z$ and $(1+z)^{1/2}$ respectively. However, instead of directly using the Pad\\'e ratios to fit kinematic quantities with data, we adopt an alternative approach where the evolution of the cold dark matter sector is incorporated in our analysis through a semi-cosmographic equation of state, which is then, used to solve the dynamical problem in the phase space. The semi-cosmographic $(D\\_A(z), H(z))$, thus obtained, is fitted with BAO and SNIa data from DESI DR1, eBOSS and Pantheon+ respectively. We also consider a futuristic 21-cm intensity mapping experiment. We further use the semi-cosmographic fitting to reconstruct some diagnostics of background cosmology and compare our results for the two scenarios of Pad\\'e expansions.\n\n", "2503.03260": "2025-03-05, **Quasinormal Modes and Topological Characteristics of a Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by the Dehnen Type Dark Matter Halo**, Farokhnaz Hosseinifar et.al., [2503.03260v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03260v1)\n\n This study explores some properties of a black hole surrounded by a dark matter halo with a Dehnen type density distribution.

However, there are a few dwarf galaxies with purely gaseous bars: NGC3741, NGC2915 and DDO168. This is a puzzle as gas is a collisional medium, and a gaseous bar is expected to be ripped off by shock waves. We study the formation of gaseous bars in these galaxies by constructing dynamical models constrained by stellar photometry and HI observations already available. We first analytically study the dynamical stability of the galactic disks against global $m=2$ perturbations. Our results indicate that the stellar and the gas disks are moderately unstable against these bar modes. Using N-body + hydrodynamical simulations employing $RAMSES$, we next find that a purely gaseous bar is formed in an oblate dark matter halo of vertical-to-planar axes ratio $c/a = 0.6 - 0.8$, with a relatively high-spin parameter $\\Lambda = 0.04 - 0.07$, which survives for more than ten dynamical times. Further, the low values of our calculated Mach numbers $M=2-6$ of the gaseous medium comply with the survival of the gaseous bars, unaffected by shock waves. Interestingly, our simulations show the formation of a tiny stellar bar in each case. However, the temporal evolution of the change in angular momentum $L\\_z$ of the different disk components indicates the exchange of $L\\_z$ between the gas disk and the dark matter halo only; the $L\\_z$ of the stellar disk remained unchanged, indicating a weak stellar bar.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2503.03735": "2025-03-05, **Peaky Finders: Characterizing Double-Peaked Type IIb Supernovae in Large-Scale Live-Stream Photometric Surveys**, Adrian Crawford et.al., [2503.03735v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03735v1)\n\n We present the first photometric population study of double-peaked Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb). SNe IIb are produced from the core-collapse of massive stars whose outermost Hydrogen layer has been partially stripped prior to explosion. These double-peaked light curves, consisting of a shock-cooling emission peak (SCE) followed by the main nickel-powered peak, contain more crucial information about the progenitor system than the typical single-peaked light curves. We compiled and analyzed a sample of 14 spectroscopically confirmed SNe IIb -- including previously unpublished and re-classified -- with publicly available photometric observations, discovered between 2018--2022, from the ZTF and ATLAS surveys. We developed and fit a piecewise linear model, referred to as the ``lightning bolt model,'' to describe the early-time behavior of these objects to measure population statistics. Notably, we find the SCE peak lasts, on average, fewer than five days above half-maximum light with a mean rise time of $2.07\\pm1.0$ and $1.1\\pm0.8$ mags/day in the g- and r-band respectively. These SCE rise rates are over 10x faster than -- and last only a third the duration of -- the rise to the nickel-powered peak. These rise times are comparable to those of fast blue optical transient (FBOT) events and we discuss the implications in the text. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept alert filter, using the ANTARES broker, to demonstrate how to translate these population statistics into simple and effective filters to find potential double-peaked SNe IIb in large-scale survey alert streams, like the imminent Vera C.
