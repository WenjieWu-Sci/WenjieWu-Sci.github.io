Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites.

Ha et.al., [2510.11030v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11030v1)\n\n Blazars, particularly Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), are well-known for their ability to accelerate a substantial population of electrons and positrons, as inferred from multiwavelength radiation observations. Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs.We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \\sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production could account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and emphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating that even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2510.11700": "2025-10-13, **Revisiting the limits on dark matter annihilation cross-section and decay lifetime in light of electron and positron fluxes**, Nagisa Hiroshima et.al., [2510.11700v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11700v1)\n\n We revisit the upper bound on the annihilation cross-section, $\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle$ of a stable dark matter (DM) of mass $5\\times10^2-10^{14}$ GeV by considering five different channels: $W^+W^-$, $b\\bar{b}$, $\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, and $e^+e^-$.

Recently, it has been claimed that the anomalous period decays in two of these systems may be explained by dynamical friction due to very high dark matter (DM) densities around the black holes. We critically assess these claims by performing $N$-body simulations of binaries embedded in dense DM ``spikes\". We simulate the previously-studied systems XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00, as well as studying the third binary Nova Muscae 1991 for the first time in this context. These simulations show that feedback on the DM distribution plays a crucial role and we rule out previously-claimed shallow DM spikes. We set lower limits on the steepness $\\gamma$ of DM density profiles required to explain the period decay in these LMXBs, requiring $\\gamma \\gtrsim 2.15-2.20$ in XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00 and $\\gamma \\gtrsim 2.3$ in Nova Muscae 1991.

Our extended model is calibrated using two complementary cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Aeos, which resolves individual Population III and II stars to $z\\sim14.6$, and Renaissance, which is lower resolution but follows large-scale metal-enriched star formation to $z \\sim 11$. With a combined calibration, we capture small-scale physics of primordial star formation over a large range in halo mass.

Achieving this agreement requires increasing the normalization of, flattening the redshift dependence of, and adding scatter to the commonly used critical mass threshold $M\\_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. Our treatment of the delay between Pop III stellar death and subsequent Pop II star formation emphasizes the need to account for halos that have yet to transition to Pop II, since incomplete sampling of this delay in simulations limits physically motivated calibrations.

Their formation is usually attributed to large positive curvature perturbations, which collapse upon Hubble re-entry during radiation domination. In this work we investigate instead the role of negative curvature perturbations, corresponding to the growth of primordial void (PV) like regions. Using numerical relativity simulations, we show that sufficiently deep PV can undergo a nonlinear rebounce at the center, generating an effective overdensity that eventually collapses into a PBH. We determine the critical threshold for this process for a variety of equations of state, and demonstrate that the resulting black holes obey a scaling relation analogous to the standard overdensity case.

We choose the Hubble radius, $L=H^{-1}$, as system's IR cutoff and determine the cosmological implications of this model. We first consider a dark energy (DE) dominated universe and reveal that this model mimics the cosmological constant with $w\\_{DE}=-1$. This implies that the theoretical origin of the cosmological constant, $\\Lambda$, may be understood through KHDE in the context of Kaniadakis cosmology. Remarkably, we observe that in the absence of interaction between DE and dark matter (DM), and in contrast to HDE in standard cosmology, our model can explain the current acceleration of the cosmic expansion for the Hubble radius as IR cutoff. When the interaction between DE and DM is taken into account, we see that the total equation of state parameter (EoS), $w\\_{tot}=p\\_{tot}/\\rho\\_{tot}$ can cross the phantom line at the present time.

Here we present four new `surrogate' models, all built with the Nexus framework. The simulations contain stars, dark matter and gas. Our most sophisticated model allows gas to evolve thermodynamically, and includes star formation, metal production, and stellar feedback. The other three models in this work have an isothermal gas disc. We examine these new simulations in the context of cold gas observations of the Galaxy. Our focus is the so-called `HI terminal velocity curve' - a heliocentric measurement of the maximum Vlos as a function of Galactic longitude, which dates back to the early days of radio astronomy. It is a powerful approach to indirectly estimating the gas dynamics because it does not require knowledge about the distance to individual gas clouds, which is difficult to estimate. A comparison of the terminal velocities and recovered rotation curve values in the simulations against observations suggests that our models are in need of further refinement. The gravitational torques associated with our synthetic bars are too strong, driving excessive streaming motion in the inner gas disc. This causes the simulated terminal velocity curves in the Galactic Quadrant I and IV to deviate substantially from each other, unlike what is seen in observed HI terminal velocities of the MW.

Our numerical analysis on the string collision shows that a sizable number of axions can be produced at the reconnection, and further emissions occur from moving kinks afterward. Furthermore, the simulation on the string network shows multimodal axion emissions in the sense that axions are produced in both the low-energy and high-energy regimes.

We identified a measurable line of B I at 2089.6 A.   In our sample of metal-poor warm stars, this line is practically free from blending lines,   and for this reason the precision of the presently derived boron abundances is unprecedented.   We find that in the interval -2.6<[Fe/H]<-1.0, the slope of the relation A(B) versus [Fe/H] is significantly larger than 1, and thus steeper than that obtained with Be abundances. As a consequence, we find in this interval of metallicity a B/Be ratio that slightly increases with [Fe/H].
