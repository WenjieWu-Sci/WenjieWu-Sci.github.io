Nikolakopoulos et.al., [2406.09244v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09244v1)\n\n Neutrino event generators make use of intranuclear cascade models (INCs), to predict the kinematics of hadrons produced in neutrino-nucleus interactions. We perform a consistent comparison of different INCs, by using the same set of events as input to the NEUT, NuWro, Achilles and INCL INCs. The inputs correspond to calculations of the fully differential single-proton knockout cross section, either in the distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA) or plane-wave impulse approximation (PWIA), both including realistic nuclear hole spectral functions. We compare the INC results to DWIA calculations with an optical potential, used extensively in the analysis of (e,e'p) experiments. We point out a systematic discrepancy between both approaches. We apply the INC results to recent MicroBooNE data. We assess the influence of the choice of spectral function, finding that large variations in realistic spectral functions are indistinguishable with present data. The data is underpredicted, with strength missing in the region where two-nucleon knockout and resonance production contribute. However, the data is underpredicted also in regions of low transverse missing momentum, where one-nucleon knockout dominates. The inclusion of the interference with two-body currents could lead to additional strength in this region.\n\n", "2406.08978": "2024-06-13, **MURCA driven Bulk viscosity in neutrino trapped baryonic matter**, Sreemoyee Sarkar et.al., [2406.08978v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08978v1)\n\n We examine bulk viscosity, taking into account trapped neutrinos in baryonic matter, in the context of binary neutron star mergers. Following the merging event, the binary star can yield a remnant compact object with densities up to $5$ nuclear saturation density and temperature upto $50$ MeV resulting in the retention of neutrinos. We employ two relativistic mean field models, NL3 and DDME2, to describe the neutrino-trapped baryonic matter. The dissipation coefficient is determined by evaluating the Modified URCA interaction rate in the dense baryonic medium, and accounting for perturbations caused by density oscillations. We observe the resonant behavior of bulk viscosity as it varies with the temperature of the medium. The bulk viscosity peak remains within the temperature range of $\\sim 13-50$ MeV, depending upon the underlying equation of states and lepton fractions. This temperature range corresponds to the relevant domain of binary neutron star mergers. We also note that in presence of neutrinos in the medium the bulk viscosity peak shifts towards higher temperature and the peak value of bulk viscosity also changes. The time scale of viscous dissipation is dictated by the beta-off-equilibrium susceptibilities derived from the nuclear equation of state. The resulting viscous decay time scale ranges from $32-100$ milliseconds, which aligns with the order of magnitude of the post-merger object's survival time in some specific scenarios.\n\n", "2406.08752": "2024-06-13, **Scotogenic gauge mechanism for neutrino mass and dark matter**, Phung Van Dong et.al., [2406.08752v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08752v1)\n\n Scotogenic is a scheme for neutrino mass generation through the one-loop contribution of an inert scalar doublet and three sterile neutrinos. This work argues that such inert scalar doublet is a Goldstone boson mode associated with a gauge symmetry breaking. Hence, the resultant scotogenic gauge mechanism is very predictive, generating neutrino mass as contributed by a new gauge boson doublet that eats such Goldstone bosons. The dark matter stability is manifestly ensured by a matter parity as residual gauge symmetry for which a vector dark matter candidate is hinted.\n\n", "2406.08663": "2024-06-12, **Dark Neutrino Moments From Light Loops**, Gonzalo Herrera et.al., [2406.08663v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08663v1)\n\n Active and sterile neutrinos may acquire \"dark moments\" via one-loop diagrams with a massless dark photon and new light particles in the loop. Due to the kinetic mixing between the dark photon and the Standard Model photon, neutrinos would obtain effective electromagnetic moments. This mechanism allows for enhanced electromagnetic moments that can evade constraints on particles directly charged under electromagnetism.

If those dark-sector particles are stable, they would survive to the present day as \"Hawking relics\" and modify the subsequent growth of cosmological structure. We show that such relics are produced with much larger momenta, but in smaller quantities than the familiar thermal relics considered in standard cosmology. Consequently, Hawking relics with keV-MeV masses affect the growth of large-scale structure in a similar way to eV-scale thermal relics like massive neutrinos. We model their production and evolution, and show that their momentum distributions are broader than comparable relics with thermal distributions. Warm Hawking relics affect the growth of cosmological perturbations and we constrain their abundance to be less than $2\\%$ of the dark matter over a broad range of their viable parameter space. Finally, we examine how future measurements of the matter power spectrum can distinguish Hawking relics from thermal particles.\n\n", "2406.08540": "2024-06-12, **Ray-tracing vs. Born approximation in full-sky weak lensing simulations of the MillenniumTNG project**, Fulvio Ferlito et.al., [2406.08540v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08540v1)\n\n Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for precision tests of cosmology. As the expected deflection angles are small, predictions based on non-linear N-body simulations are commonly computed with the Born approximation. Here we examine this assumption using ${\\small DORIAN}$, a newly developed full-sky ray-tracing scheme applied to high-resolution mass-shell outputs of the two largest simulations in the MillenniumTNG suite, each with a 3000 Mpc box containing almost 1.1 trillion cold dark matter particles in addition to 16.7 billion particles representing massive neutrinos. We examine simple two-point statistics like the angular power spectrum of the convergence field, as well as statistics sensitive to higher order correlations such as peak and minimum statistics, void statistics, and Minkowski functionals of the convergence maps. Overall, we find only small differences between the Born approximation and a full ray-tracing treatment. While these are negligibly small at power-spectrum level, some higher order statistics show more sizable effects; ray-tracing is necessary to achieve percent level precision. At the resolution reached here, full-sky maps with 0.8 billion pixels and an angular resolution of 0.43 arcmin, we find that interpolation accuracy can introduce appreciable errors in ray-tracing results. We therefore implemented an interpolation method based on nonuniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFT) along with more traditional methods. Bilinear interpolation introduces significant smoothing, while nearest grid point sampling agrees well with NUFFT, at least for our fiducial source redshift, $z\\_s=1.0$, and for the 1 arcmin smoothing we use for higher-order statistics.\n\n", "2406.08359": "2024-06-12, **Reactor Antineutrino Directionality Measurement with the PROSPECT-I Detector**, M.

We extend previous calculations of the axial transition form factors from the vacuum (free space) to the nuclear medium (symmetric nuclear matter). The extension of the model to the nuclear medium takes into account the modifications of the properties of hadrons in the medium (masses and coupling constants), as determined by the quark-meson coupling model. The axial-vector ($G\\_A$) and the induced pseudoscalar ($G\\_P$) form factors are evaluated for different values of the nuclear density $\\rho$ in terms of the square transfer momentum $q^2= -Q^2$. We conclude that in general the $G\\_A$ and $G\\_P$ form factors are reduced in the nuclear medium. The reduction is stronger for light baryons and high densities. The medium modifications are milder for the heavier octet baryons, particularly at large $Q^2$.

We have revisited these constraints, taking into account the local heating and ionisation of the gas around the black holes.

We present mock catalogues that reproduce the selection criteria of MWS and the format of the final MWS data set. These catalogues can be used to test methods for quantifying the properties of stellar halo substructure and reconstructing the Milky Way's accretion history with the MWS data, including the effects of halo-to-halo variance. The mock catalogues are based on a phase-space kernel expansion technique applied to star particles in the Auriga suite of six high-resolution $\\Lambda$CDM magneto-hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations. They include photometric properties (and associated errors) used in DESI target selection and the outputs of the MWS spectral analysis pipeline (radial velocity, metallicity, surface gravity, and temperature). They also include information from the underlying simulation, such as the total gravitational potential and information on the progenitors of accreted halo stars. We discuss how the subset of halo stars observable by MWS in these simulations corresponds to their true content and properties.

Stars from such merger events define substructures in phase-space, for example in the form of streams, which are groups of stars moving on similar trajectories. The nearby Helmi streams discovered more than two decades ago are a well-known example. Using 6D phase-space information from the Gaia space mission, Dodd et al. (2022) have recently reported that the Helmi streams are split into two clumps in angular momentum space. Such substructure can be explained and sustained in time if the dark matter halo of the Milky Way takes a prolate shape in the region probed by the orbits of the stars in the streams. Here, we explore the behaviour of the two clumps identified in the Helmi streams in a Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) framework to test this alternative model of gravity. We perform orbit integrations of Helmi streams member stars in a simplified MOND model of the Milky Way and using the more sophisticated Phantom of RAMSES simulation framework. We find with both approaches that the two Helmi streams clumps do not retain their identity and dissolve after merely 100 Myr. This extremely short timescale would render the detection of two separate clumps as very unlikely in MONDian gravity. The observational constraints provided by the streams, which MOND fails to reproduce in its current formulation, could potentially also be used to test other alternative gravity models.\n\n", "2406.08831": "2024-06-13, **Exponential gravity with logarithmic corrections in the presence of axion dark matter**, Sergei D.

As the possible axion mass spans multiple orders of magnitude, microwave cavities must be tunable and it is desirable for the cavity to have a tunable frequency range that is as wide as possible. Since the tunable frequency range generally increases as the dimension of the conductor tuning rod increases for a given cylindrical conductor cavity system, we developed a cavity system with a large dimensional tuning rod in order to increase this. We, for the first time, employed not only a piezoelectric motor, but also gears to drive a large and accordingly heavy tuning rod, where such a combination to increase driving power can be adopted for extreme environments as is the case for axion dark matter experiments: cryogenic, high-magnetic-field, and high vacuum.

Furthermore, we predict the number of strong gravitational lenses and conduct statefinder and $Om$ diagnostic analyses to validate and characterize the model.\n\n", "2406.08919": "2024-06-13, **Strong gravitational lenses from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory**, Anowar J. Shajib et.al., [2406.08919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08919v1)\n\n Like many areas of astrophysics and cosmology, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be transformational for almost all the applications of strong lensing, thanks to the dramatic increase in the number of known strong lenses by two orders of magnitude or more and the readily available time-domain data for the lenses with transient sources. In this article, we provide an overview of the forecasted number of discovered lenses of different types and describe the primary science cases these large lens samples will enable. We provide an updated forecast on the joint constraint for the dark energy equation-of-state parameters, $w\\_0$ and $w\\_a$, from combining all strong lensing probes of dark energy. We update the previous forecast from the Rubin Observatory Dark Energy Science Collaboration's Science Review Document by adding two new crucial strong lensing samples: lensed Type Ia supernovae and single-deflector lenses with measured stellar kinematics. Finally, we describe the current and near-future activities and collaborative efforts within the strong lensing community in preparation for the arrival of the first real dataset from Rubin in early 2026.\n\n", "2406.08561": "2024-06-12, **Theory and Observation of Winds from Star-Forming Galaxies**, Todd A. Thompson et.al., [2406.08561v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08561v1)\n\n Galactic winds shape the stellar, gas, and metal content of galaxies. To quantify their impact, we must understand their physics. We review potential wind-driving mechanisms and observed wind properties, with a focus on the warm ionized and hot X-ray-emitting gas. Energy and momentum injection by supernovae (SNe), cosmic rays, radiation pressure, and magnetic fields are considered in the light of observations: (1) Emission and absorption line measurements of cool/warm gas provide our best physical diagnostics of galactic outflows. (2) The critical unsolved problem is how to accelerate cool gas to the high velocities observed. Although conclusive evidence for no one mechanism exists, the momentum, energy, and mass-loading budgets observed compare well with theory. (3) A model where star formation provides a force $\\sim L/c$, where $L$ is the bolometric luminosity, and cool gas is pushed out of the galaxy's gravitational potential, compares well with available data. The wind power is $\\sim0.1$ that provided by SNe. (4) The very hot X-ray emitting phase, may be a (or the) prime mover. Momentum and energy exchange between the hot and cooler phases is critical to the gas dynamics. (5) Gaps in our observational knowledge include the hot gas kinematics and the size and structure of the outflows probed with UV absorption lines. Simulations are needed to more fully understand mixing, cloud-radiation, cloud-cosmic ray, and cloud-hot wind interactions, the collective effects of star clusters, and both distributed and clustered SNe. Observational works should seek secondary correlations in the wind data that provide evidence for specific mechanisms and compare spectroscopy with the column density-velocity results from theory.\n\n", "2406.08459": "2024-06-12, **Consistent Theories for the DESI dark energy fit**, Alessio Notari et.al., [2406.08459v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08459v1)\n\n We search for physically consistent realizations of evolving dark energy suggested by the cosmological fit of DESI, Planck and Supernovae data. First we note that any lagrangian description of the standard Chevallier-Linder-Polarski (CLP) parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w\\_{\\rm eff}$, allows for the addition of a cosmological constant. We perform the cosmological fit finding new regions of parameter space that however continue to favour dark energy with $w\\_{\\rm eff}<-1$ at early times that are challenging to realize in theoretically consistent theories. Next, in the spirit of effective field theories, we consider the effect of higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the equation of state around the present epoch. We find that non-linear corrections of the equation of state are weakly constrained, thus opening the way to scenarios that differ from CLP at early times, possibly with $w\\_{\\rm eff}>-1$ at all times. We present indeed scenarios where evolving dark energy can be realized through quintessence models. We introduce in particular the ramp model where dark energy coincides with CLP at late times and approximates to a cosmological constant at early times. The latter model provides a much better fit than $\\Lambda$CDM, and only slightly worse than $w\\_0w\\_a$CDM, but with the big advantage of being described by a simple and theoretically consistent lagrangian of a canonical quintessence model.\n\n", "2406.08371": "2024-06-12, **An Untargeted Search for Radio-Emitting Tidal Disruption Events in the VAST Pilot Survey**, Hannah Dykaar et.al., [2406.08371v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08371v1)\n\n We present a systematic search for tidal disruption events (TDEs) using radio data from the Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Pilot Survey conducted using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Historically, TDEs have been identified using observations at X-ray, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths. After discovery, a few dozen TDEs have been shown to have radio counterparts through follow-up observations. With systematic time-domain radio surveys becoming available, we can now identify new TDEs in the radio regime. A population of radio-discovered TDEs has the potential to provide several key insights including an independent constraint on their volumetric rate. We conducted a search to select variable radio sources with a single prominent radio flare and a position consistent within 2$\\sigma$ of the nucleus of a known galaxy. While TDEs were the primary target of our search, sources identified in this search may also be consistent with active galactic nuclei exhibiting unusual flux density changes at the timescales probed, uncharacteristically bright supernovae, or a population of gamma-ray bursts. We identify a sample of 12 radio-bright candidate TDEs. The timescales and luminosities range from ~6 to 230 days and ~10$^{38}$ to 10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with models of radio emission from TDEs that launch relativistic jets. After calculating the detection efficiency of our search using a Monte Carlo simulation of TDEs, and assuming all 12 sources are jetted TDEs, we derive a volumetric rate for jetted TDEs of 0.80$^{+0.31}\\_{-0.23}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with previous empirically estimated rates.\n\n", "2406.07806": "2024-06-12, **Probing the Shock Breakout Signal of SN 2024ggi from the Transformation of Early Flash Spectroscopy**, Jujia Zhang et.al., [2406.07806v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07806v1)\n\n We present early-time, hour-to-day cadence spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova (SN II) 2024ggi, which was discovered at a phase when the SN shock just emerged from the red-supergiant (RSG) progenitor star.

In the first 63 hours, spectral lines of He, C, N, and O revealed a rapid rise in ionization, as a result of the progressive sweeping-up of the CSM by the shock. The duration of the IIn-like spectra indicates a dense and relatively confined CSM distribution extending up to $\\sim\\,4\\,\\times\\,10^{14}$\\,cm.
