Atzori Corona et.al., [2307.12911v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12911v1)\n\n The search for coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CE$\\nu$NS) using reactor antineutrinos represents a formidable experimental challenge, recently boosted by the observation of such a process at the Dresden-II reactor site using a germanium detector. This observation relies on an unexpected enhancement at low energies of the measured quenching factor with respect to the theoretical Lindhard model prediction, which implies an extra observable ionization signal produced after the nuclear recoil. A possible explanation for this additional contribution could be provided by the so-called Migdal effect, which however has never been observed. Here, we study in detail the impact of the Migdal contribution to the standard CE$\\nu$NS signal calculated with the Lindhard quenching factor, finding that the former is completely negligible for observed energies below $\\sim 0.3\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ where the signal is detectable, and thus unable to provide any contribution to CE$\\nu$NS searches in this energy regime. To this purpose, we compare different formalisms used to describe the Migdal effect that intriguingly show a perfect agreement, making our findings robust.\n\n", "2307.12885": "2023-07-24, **Probing mass orderings in presence of a very light sterile neutrino in a liquid argon detector**, Animesh Chatterjee et.al., [2307.12885v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12885v1)\n\n Results from experiments like LSND and MiniBooNE hint towards the possible presence of an extra eV scale sterile neutrino. The addition of such a neutrino will significantly impact the standard three flavour neutrino oscillations. In particular, it can give rise to additional degeneracies due to additional sterile parameters. For an eV scale sterile neutrino, the cosmological constraints dictate that the sterile state is heavier than the three active states. However, for lower masses of sterile neutrinos, it can be lighter than one and/or more of the three states. In such cases, the mass ordering of the sterile neutrinos also becomes unknown along with the mass ordering of the active states. In this paper, we explore the mass ordering sensitivity in the presence of a sterile neutrino assuming the mass squared difference $\\|\\Delta\\_{41}\\|$ to be in the range $10^{-4} - 1$ eV$^2$. We study (i) how the ordering of the active states, i.e. the determination of the sign of $\\Delta\\_{31}$ gets affected by the presence of a sterile neutrino in the above mass range, (ii) the possible determination of the sign of $\\Delta\\_{41}$ for $\\Delta\\_{41}$ in the range $10^{-4} - 0.1$ eV$^2$. This analysis is done in the context of a liquid argon detector using both beam neutrinos traveling a distance of 1300 km and atmospheric neutrinos which propagates through a distance ranging from 10 - 10000 km allowing resonant matter effects. Apart from presenting separate results from these sources, we also do a combined study and probe the synergy between these two in giving an enhanced sensitivity.\n\n", "2307.12769": "2023-07-24, **First look at data from the 13-antenna setup of GRANDProto300 in northwest China**, Peng-Xiong Ma et.al., [2307.12769v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12769v1)\n\n The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, cosmic rays, and gamma rays, with energies above 100 PeV.

This study has been made using a theoretical model in which the weak hadronic current receives contribution from the nonresonant Born terms as well as from the resonance excitations. The Born terms are obtained using the SU(3) symmetric chiral model, used earlier in the study of $K-$meson production. The contribution from the resonance terms is considered from the excitation of five nucleon resonances viz. $S\\_{11}(1535)$, $S\\_{11}(1650)$, $P\\_{11}(1710)$, $P\\_{11}(1880)$, and $S\\_{11}(1895)$.

The probability of chiral oscillation is suppressed by a factor of $m^2/E^2$ making the effect small for relativistic neutrinos. However, for non-relativistic neutrinos, this effects can be significant. In matter, the equation of motion is modified. When neutrinos produced in weak interaction pass through the matter, the effective energies are split into two different ones depending on the helicity of the neutrino. This results in different oscillation behavior for neutrinos with different helicity, in particular there is a new resonant effect related to the helicity state of neutrino different than the usual MSW effect. For Majorana neutrinos, chiral oscillation also depends on Majorana phases.\n\n", "2307.12363": "2023-07-23, **On the Origin of Galactic Diffuse TeV-PeV Emission: Insight from LHAASO and IceCube**, Kai Yan et.al., [2307.12363v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12363v1)\n\n The high-energy diffuse gamma-ray emission and neutrino emission are expected from the Galactic plane, generated by hadronuclear interactions between cosmic rays (CR) and interstellar medium (ISM). Therefore, measurements of these diffuse emissions will provide important clues on the origin and nature of Galactic CRs. Comparing the latest observations of LHAASO and IceCube on the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray and neutrino emissions respectively, we suggest that the diffuse gamma-ray emission at multi-TeV energies contains a considerable contribution of a leptonic component. By modelling the gamma-ray halos powered by middle-aged pulsars in our Galaxy with taking into account the magnetic field configuration and the interstellar radiation field in the Galaxy, we demonstrate that the collective contribution of pulsar halos can account for the excess in the measured diffuse gamma-ray emission with respect to the predicted flux from CR-ISM interactions.

As a contribution to this endeavor, we extend the existing formulation based on a single 1D Gaussian wave function to an amplitude between two distinct 3D Gaussian wave packets, corresponding to the neutrinos being produced and detected, with different central momenta and spacetime positions and with different widths. We find that the spatial widths-squared for the production and detection appear additively in the (de)coherence length and in the localization factor for governing the propagation of the wave packet, whereas they appear as the reduced one (inverse of the sum of inverse) in the momentum conservation factor. The overall probability is governed by the ratio of the reduced to the sum.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2307.12952": "2023-07-24, **Search for the Migdal effect in liquid xenon with keV-level nuclear recoils**, Jingke Xu et.al., [2307.12952v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12952v1)\n\n The Migdal effect predicts that a nuclear recoil interaction can be accompanied by atomic ionization, allowing many dark matter direct detection experiments to gain sensitivity to sub-GeV masses.

Despite an observed background rate lower than that of expected signals in the region of interest, we do not observe a signal consistent with predictions.

Moreover, the inferred merger rate constraints the fraction of PBH with masses $m \\sim 10 \\, M\\_{\\odot}$ in the dark matter (DM) to $f\\_{PBH} \\lesssim 10^{-3}$. This constraint assumes that after the formation of PBH binaries, they do not get destroyed or their parameters are not perturbed until the merger. However, PBHs themselves contribute to the formation of early DM structures in which the interactions between PBHs take place actively. This leads to the fact that the binaries can be perturbed in such a way that their lifetime becomes longer than the Hubble time $t\\_H$. In this work, we consider the effect of the initial spatial Poisson distribution of PBHs on the structure formation at the high redshifts $z \\gtrsim 10$. Next, we explore the evolution of such halos due to the interaction of PBHs with each other and with DM particles. We show that the early halos evolve on timescales much shorter than the age of the Universe. Furthermore, for fractions of PBHs $f\\_{PBH} < 1$, the internal dynamics of a halo is significantly accelerated due to the dynamical friction of PBHs against DM particles. As a result, a significant fraction of binaries will be perturbed in such structures, and the gravitational waves constraints on PBHs with masses $m \\sim 10 \\, M\\_{\\odot}$ can be weakened to $f\\_{PBH} \\sim 0.1$.\n\n", "2307.12891": "2023-07-24, **Design and sensitivity of a 6-axis seismometer for gravitational wave observatories**, Leonid Prokhorov et.al., [2307.12891v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12891v1)\n\n We present the design, control system, and noise analysis of a 6-axis seismometer comprising a mass suspended by a single fused silica fibre.

We develop the sensor for gravitational-wave observatories, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, to help them observe intermediate-mass black holes, increase their duty cycle, and improve localisation of sources.

This Earth shielding effect can result in diurnal modulation of the DM-induced recoil event rates observed underground due to the self-rotation of the Earth. For electron recoil signals from DM-electron scatterings, the current experimental constraints are very stringent such that the diurnal modulation cannot be observed for halo DM. We propose a novel type of diurnal modulation effect: diurnal modulation in electron recoil signals induced by DM-nucleon scattering via the Migdal effect. We set so far the most stringent constraints on DM-nucleon scattering cross section via the Migdal effect for sub-GeV DM using the S2-only data of PandaX-II and PandaX-4T with improved simulations of the Earth shielding effect. Based on the updated constraints, we show that the Migdal effect induced diurnal modulation of electron events can still be significant in the low energy region, and can be probed by experiments such as PandaX-4T in the near future.\n\n", "2307.12748": "2023-07-24, **Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Star in the light of HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607**, Pinku Routaray et.al., [2307.12748v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12748v1)\n\n This study explores the implications of Dark Matter in Neutron Stars (DMANS) by focusing on two specific astronomical objects: HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607.

As a key sub-detector of DAMPE, the Bismuth Germanium Oxide (BGO) imaging calorimeter is utilized to measure the particle energy with a high resolution. The nonlinear fluorescence response of BGO for large ionization energy deposition, known as the quenching effect, results in an under-estimate of the energy measurement for cosmic-ray nuclei. In this paper, various models are employed to characterize the BGO quenching factors obtained from the experimental data of DAMPE. Applying the proper quenching model in the detector simulation process, we investigate the tuned energy responses for various nuclei and compare the results based on two different simulation softwares, i.e. GEANT4 and FLUKA. The BGO quenching effect results in a decrease of the measured energy by approximately $2.5\\%$ ($5.7 \\%$) for carbon (iron) at $\\sim$10 GeV/n and $<1\\%$ above 1 TeV/n, respectively.

To ensure the detection of GWs, observational data must exhibit the Hellings-Downs angular correlation. It is also known that PTAs can probe ultralight dark matter. In this paper, we consider possible contamination of the Hellings-Downs angular correlation by the ultralight dark matter.

Our decomposition technique isolates galactic discs whose mass fractions, $f\\_{\\rm disc}$, correlate strongly with common alternative morphology indicators; for example, $f\\_{\\rm disc}$ is approximately equal to $\\kappa\\_{{\\rm co}}$, the fraction of stellar kinetic energy in co-rotation. The primary aim of our study, however, is to characterise the IHL of galaxies in a consistent manner and over a broad mass range, and to analyse its properties from the scale of galactic stellar haloes up to the intra-cluster light. Our results imply that the IHL fraction, $f\\_{\\rm IHL}$, has appreciable scatter and is strongly correlated with galaxy morphology: at fixed stellar mass, the IHL of disc galaxies is typically older and less massive than that of spheroids.

To date, only two glSNe with multiple images strongly lensed by galaxies have been found, but their short time delays make them unsuitable for cosmography. We simulate a realistic catalogue of lensed supernovae and study the characteristics of the population of detectable systems for different surveys. Our simulations show that the properties of glSNe in shallow surveys (such as the Zwicky Transient Facility; ZTF) are determined by the need for large magnifications, which favours systems of four images with short time delays and low image separations. This picture is consistent with the properties of iPTF16geu and SN~Zwicky, but is not representative of the population found in deeper surveys, which are limited by the volume of the Universe that is strongly lensed.

The effective scatter and the observational uncertainties of elements within a few hundred parsecs from the Sun, even for the most abundant metals like carbon, oxygen and silicon, are still controversial. Here we analyse the stellar production and the chemical evolution of key elements that underpin the formation of rocky (C, O, Mg, Si) and gas/ice giant planets (C, N, O, S). We calculate 198 galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models of the solar neighbourhood to analyse the impact of different sets of stellar yields, of the upper mass limit for massive stars contributing to GCE ($M\\_{\\rm up}$) and of supernovae from massive-star progenitors which do not eject the bulk of the iron-peak elements (faint supernovae). Even considering the GCE variation produced via different sets of stellar yields, the observed dispersion of elements reported for stars in the Milky Way disk is not reproduced. Among others, the observed range of super-solar [Mg/Si] ratios, sub-solar [S/N], and the dispersion of up to 0.5 dex for [S/Si] challenge our models.
