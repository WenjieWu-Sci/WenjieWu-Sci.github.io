To capitalize on the upcoming opportunity provided by new UHE neutrino telescopes, we provide state-of-the-art forecasts of the discovery of a diffuse flux of UHE neutrinos over the next 10-20 years, focusing on neutrino radio-detection in the planned IceCube-Gen2 detector. We use state-of-the-art flux predictions and detector modeling. We find that, even under conservative analysis choices, most benchmark UHE neutrino flux models from the literature may be discovered within 10 years of detector exposure, with many discoverable sooner, and may be distinguished from each other.

Valera et.al., [2307.11050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11050v1)\n\n The investigation of neutrino interactions with matter serves as a valuable tool for understanding the fundamental structure of nucleons and potentially uncovering novel physics phenomena. To date, the neutrino-nucleon cross section has been examined across a range of energies spanning from a few hundred MeV to PeV. However, the pursuit of ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic neutrinos, surpassing 100 PeV in energy, holds the promise of further advancements. In the next 10-20 years, UHE neutrino telescopes, currently in the planning stage, may ultimately succeed in their detection. This article presents pioneering and comprehensive estimation forecasts for the ultra-high-energy neutrino-nucleon cross section, with a specific focus on the employment of neutrino radio-detection within the IceCube-Gen2 experiment. The study incorporates cutting-edge methodologies in UHE neutrino flux prediction, neutrino propagation within the Earth, radio detection techniques, and the treatment of background data to facilitate accurate cross section measurement projections. Assuming the successful detection of at least a few tens of UHE neutrino-induced events over a 10-year period, IceCube-Gen2 could achieve, for the first time, the measurement of the cross section at center-of-mass energies of approximately $\\sqrt{s} \\approx 10$--100 TeV. Furthermore, if the number of events exceeds one hundred, the precision of the cross section measurement could be comparable to its corresponding theoretical prediction.\n\n", "2307.10898": "2023-07-20, **Correlating neutrino magnetic moment and scalar triplet dark matter to enlighten XENONnT bounds in a Type-II model**, Shivaramakrishna Singirala et.al., [2307.10898v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10898v1)\n\n We investigate neutrino magnetic moment, triplet scalar dark matter in a Type-II radiative seesaw scenario. With three vector-like fermion doublets and two scalar triplets, we provide a loop level setup for the electromagnetic vertex of neutrinos. All the scalar multiplet components constitute the total dark matter abundance of the Universe and also their scattering cross section with detector lie below the experimental upper limit. Using the consistent parameter space in dark matter domain, we obtain light neutrino mass in sub-eV scale and also magnetic moment in the desired range.

Recently, there have been proposed interpretations of the Bardeen spacetime as quantum corrections to the Schwarzschild solution. Our study focuses on investigating the quasinormal modes and Hawking radiation of the Bardeen black hole. We have observed that previous studies on the quasinormal modes for the Bardeen black hole suffer from inaccuracies that cannot be neglected. Therefore, we propose accurate calculations of the quasinormal modes for scalar, electromagnetic, and neutrino fields in the Bardeen spacetime. Additionally, we have computed the grey-body factors and analyzed the emission rates of Hawking radiation. Even when the quantum correction is small and the fundamental mode only slightly differs from its Schwarzschild value, the first several overtones deviate at an increasingly stronger rate. This deviation leads to the appearance of overtones with very small real oscillation frequencies. This outburst of overtones is closely linked to the fact that the quantum-corrected black hole differs from its classical limit primarily near the event horizon. Moreover, the intensity of the Hawking radiation is significantly suppressed (up to three orders of magnitude) by the quantum correction.\n\n", "2307.10382": "2023-07-19, **Neutrinos from GRB 221009A: producing ALPs and explaining LHAASO anomalous $\u03b3$ event**, Nicol\u00e1s Bernal et.al., [2307.10382v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10382v1)\n\n We propose a novel explanation for the 18 TeV gamma ray from GRB 221009A observed by LHAASO. High-energy neutrinos are converted into axion-like particles (ALPs) via their interaction with the cosmic neutrino background. Subsequently, ALPs are converted into high-energy photons in the magnetic field of our galaxy. We compute the fluxes of neutrinos, ALPs, and photons reaching Earth. IceCube's constraints on the neutrino flux from GRB 221009A translate into a severe upper bound on the photon flux. We find a range of parameters where all existing bounds are satisfied and the 18 TeV LHAASO photon can be explained. In the future, the specific correlation between the photon and neutrino flux reaching Earth from powerful neutrino sources with energies larger than 10 TeV such as GRBs or AGNs, can be used as a tool to differentiate our explanation from the alternatives suggested in the literature. We discuss how the interactions of our scenario can be embedded within electroweak gauge-invariant models, avoiding various cosmological and terrestrial bounds.

Recently, it has been advanced the conjecture that neutrino collisions with the medium could be another mean to kickstart flavor change (collisional instability). We rely on a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with mass $18.6\\ M\\_\\odot$, compute the neutrino angular distributions solving the kinetic equations and investigate the occurrence of flavor instabilities at different post-bounce times, ranging from the accretion phase to the early cooling phase. We find that fast and slow flavor instabilities largely dominate over the collisional ones in the decoupling region for all post-bounce times. While more work is needed to assess the relevance of collisional instabilities in neutrino-dense environments, our findings suggest that neutrino collisions with matter affect the flavor evolution in the decoupling region, but are not responsible for triggering flavor conversion.\n\n", "2307.10126": "2023-07-19, **Neutrino spin oscillations in a magnetized Polish doughnut**, Maxim Dvornikov et.al., [2307.10126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10126v1)\n\n We study the gravitational scattering of ultrarelativistic neutrinos off a rotating supermassive black hole (BH) surrounded by a thick magnetized accretion disk. Neutrinos interact electroweakly with background matter and with the magnetic field in the disk since neutrinos are supposed to possess nonzero magnetic moments. The interaction with external fields results in neutrino spin oscillations. We find that the toroidal magnetic field, inherent in the magnetized Polish doughnut, does not cause a significant spin-flip for any reasonable strengths of the toroidal component. The reduction of the observed neutrino flux, owing to neutrino spin oscillations, is predicted. A poloidal component of the magnetic field gives the main contribution to the modification of the observed flux. The neutrino interaction with matter, rotating with relativistic velocities, also changes the flux of neutrinos.

In this work we focus on the collision of red giants and in particular on the formation of non-thermal processes through collisions and their properties. We analytically address these points by evaluating head-on collisions but also take into account scenarios with a deviation from the radial orbit, which we treat in a perturbative fashion. The collisions produce internal shocks with supersonic Mach numbers. Almost immediately, jet-like structures with important Lorentz factors form. The debris from the collision produces another shock wave which, when interacting with the interstellar medium of a galactic nucleus, leads to particle acceleration. We estimate the background flux in X- and gamma rays created by the background of these collisions by deriving the spectral index within a radius of 100 Mpc and find that they are high. Additionally, we make an estimate of the neutrino production and find about $10^{11}$ neutrinos per square meter per second for a collision at 100 Mpc from Earth. Also, we derive that there is a non-negligible chance to ignite fusion during the collision, due to the squeezing of the material. We investigate the possibility that the degenerate cores collide with each other, leading to a high afterglow luminosity, and find that it is non-negligible, although this should be addressed with dedicated numerical simulations. Colliding red giants in galactic nuclei trigger a plethora of high-energy phenomena, and have a particular gravitational wave emission associated, as shown by us, so that their detection will allow us to rule out alternatives.\n\n", "2307.09948": "2023-07-19, **FCNCs, Proton Stability, $ g_\u03bc-2$ Discrepancy, Neutralino cold Dark Matter in Flipped $SU(5) \\times U(1)_\u03c7$ from $F$ Theory based on $ A_{4} $ Symmetry**, Gayatri Ghosh et.al., [2307.09948v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09948v1)\n\n We predict the low energy signatures of a Flipped $SU(5) \\times U(1)\\_{\\chi}$ effective local model , constructed within the framework of F$-$theory based on $ A\\_{4} $ symmetry.

The combined NNLO QCD+NLO EW predictions are achieved based on the fully-differential calculations of cross sections of both the invisible and leptonic processes in proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy.

Various tests with threshold requirements of transverse momenta of neutrino pair and leptons are performed to assess the impact on the combined predictions.

In this work, we analyze the implications of SIdr on the CMB power spectrum and explore its potential in resolving the Hubble tension. SIdr exhibits two distinct behaviors based on the interacting strength: strongly self-coupled and medium self-coupled. These behaviors are evident in the analysis of CMB data. According to Planck data, the dark radiation component consists of both free-streaming neutrinos and possible SIdr. The total contribution from these components yields relativistic species with $N\\_{\\rm eff}=3.046$. In the framework of universal coupling between dark radiations, a consistent value of $N\\_{\\rm eff}=3.27\\_{-0.31}^{+0.23}$ is obtained. Additionally, this coupling results in an increase in the Hubble constant ($H\\_0$) to $70.1\\_{-1.6}^{+1.3}, \\text{km/s/Mpc}$. However, when considering the number of free-streaming neutrinos as a parameter, the existence of SIdr is not supported. This makes its fraction in radiation to be $R\\_x=0.047^{+0.025}\\_{-0.053}$. Although the Hubble constant is still enhanced, it comes at the expense of a higher $N\\_{\\rm eff}=3.52\\pm0.25$. Our findings reveal that the ACT and SPT data provide support for the presence of SIdr, particularly when considering a variable number of free-streaming species. In this case, SIdr accounts for approximately 12.7\\% of the total radiation content. However, it is important to note that relying solely on SIdr is insufficient to completely resolve the Hubble tension. Finally, we investigate the constraints on SIdr imposed by future experiments, which improve the limits on scaled interacting strength $\\log\\_{10}\\tilde G\\_{\\rm eff}$ by a factor of 4.5 compared to the current constraints.\n\n", "2307.09737": "2023-07-19, **Probing for chiral $Z^\\prime$ gauge boson through scattering measurement experiments**, Kento Asai et.al., [2307.09737v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09737v1)\n\n Observation of tiny neutrino mass can not be explained within the framework of Standard Model (SM) and it allows us to construct beyond the SM (BSM) scenarios.

We here present a new cluster-finding algorithm, CluMPR (Clusters from Masses and Photometric Redshifts), that exploits photometric redshifts (photo-z's) as well as photometric stellar mass measurements. CluMPR uses a 2-dimensional binary search tree to search for overdensities of massive galaxies with similar redshifts on the sky and then probabilistically assigns cluster membership by accounting for photo-z uncertainties. We leverage the deep DESI Legacy Surveys grzW1W2 imaging over one-third of the sky to create a catalogue of ~ 300,000 galaxy cluster candidates out to z = 1, including tabulations of member galaxies and estimates of each cluster's total stellar mass. Compared to other methods, CluMPR is particularly effective at identifying clusters at the high end of the redshift range considered (z = 0.75-1), with minimal contamination from low-mass groups. These characteristics make it ideal for identifying strongly lensed high-redshift supernovae and quasars that are powerful probes of cosmology, dark matter, and stellar astrophysics.

Additionally, knowledge of the binary fraction in dwarf galaxies is important with respect to avoiding overestimations of their dark matter content, inferred from stellar kinematics.   Methods: We refined an existing method from the literature, placing an emphasis on providing robust uncertainties on the value of the binary fraction. We applied this modified method to a VLT/FLAMES dataset for Sculptor, specifically acquired for the purpose of velocity monitoring of individual stars, as well as to literature datasets for other six MW \"classical\" dSphs. In all cases, the targeted stars were mainly red giant branch stars (RGBs), with expected masses of around 0.8 M$\\_{\\odot}$.

We investigate how the parameter spaces of the six models can be constrained by current and future cosmological, astrophysical and collider searches, and we highlight the strong complementary between those probes. Our results demonstrate that scenarios featuring a complex (non self-conjugate) dark matter field are excluded by cosmology and astrophysics alone, the only possibility to avoid these bounds being to invoke very weak couplings and mechanisms such as conversion-driven freeze-out. For models with self-conjugate dark matter, mediator and dark matter masses are pushed deep into the TeV regime, with the lower limits on the mediator mass reaching 3 to 4 TeV and those on the dark matter mass 1 to 2 TeV.

The X-ray morphology shows two surface-brightness peaks between the BCGs. We construct weak lensing mass maps that reveal a mass peak associated with each subcluster. Fitting NFW profiles to the lensing data, we find masses of $M\\_{\\rm 200c}=36\\pm11\\times10^{13}$ and $38\\pm11\\times10^{13}$ M$\\_\\odot/h$ for the southern and northern subclusters respectively. From the mass maps, we infer that the two mass peaks are separated by $520^{+162}\\_{-125}$ kpc along the merger axis, whereas the two BCGs are separated by 697 kpc. We also present deep GMRT 650 MHz data to search for a radio relic or halo, and find none. Using the observed merger parameters, we find analog systems in cosmological n-body simulations and infer that this system is observed between 96-236 Myr after pericenter, with the merger axis within $28^{\\circ}$ of the plane of the sky.\n\n", "2307.09963": "2023-07-19, **Action-based dynamical models of M31-like galaxies**, Paula Gherghinescu et.al., [2307.09963v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09963v1)\n\n In this work, we present an action-based dynamical equilibrium model to constrain the phase-space distribution of stars in the stellar halo, present-day dark matter distribution, and the total mass distribution in M31-like galaxies. The model comprises a three-component gravitational potential (stellar bulge, stellar disk, and a dark matter halo), and a double-power law distribution function (DF), $f(\\mathbf{J})$, which is a function of actions. A Bayesian model-fitting algorithm was implemented that enabled both parameters of the potential and DF to be explored.   After testing the model-fitting algorithm on mock data drawn from the model itself, it was applied to a set of three M31-like haloes from the Auriga simulations (Auriga 21, Auriga 23, Auriga 24). Furthermore, we tested the equilibrium assumption and the ability of a double-power law distribution function to represent the stellar halo stars. The model incurs an error in the total enclosed mass of around 10 percent out to 100 kpc, thus justifying the equilibrium assumption. Furthermore, the double-power law DF used proves to be an appropriate description of the investigated M31-like halos. The anisotropy profiles of the halos were also investigated and discussed from a merger history point of view.\n\n", "2307.09952": "2023-07-19, **Dark Matter Halo Spin of the Dwarf Galaxy UGC 5288: Insights from Observations, N-body and Cosmological Simulations**, Sioree Ansar et.al., [2307.09952v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09952v1)\n\n Dark matter (DM) halo angular momentum is very challenging to determine from observations of galaxies. In this study, we present a new hybrid method of estimating the dimensionless halo angular momentum, halo spin of a gas-rich dwarf barred galaxy UGC5288 using N-Body/SPH simulations. We forward model the galaxy disk properties: stellar and gas mass, surface densities, disk scalelengths, bar length and bar ellipticity from observations. We use the HI rotation curve to constrain the DM halo density profile and further use the bar properties to determine the models that best represent the observed baryonic disk. We compare the halo spin profile from our models to the halo spin profiles of similar mass dwarf galaxy analogues of UGC5288 in the TNG50 simulations. The halo spin profile from our simulated models matches within ballpark values of the median spin profile of UGC5288 analogues in the TNG50 simulations, although there are some uncertainties due to the DM halo evolutionary history.\n\n", "2307.09941": "2023-07-19, **Miniclusters from axion string simulations**, Giovanni Pierobon et.al., [2307.09941v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09941v1)\n\n The properties of axion miniclusters and of the voids between them can have very strong implications for the discovery of axions and the dark matter of the Universe. These properties can be strongly affected by axion dynamics in the early Universe, such as the axion string network and the non-linear dynamics around the QCD phase transition. Recently, improvements in numerical simulation techniques have allowed us to calculate the dark matter axion field from axion strings and QCD effects using different methods: directly with low-tension strings but high resolution, directly with effective high-tension strings, or indirectly by extrapolating an attractor solution. In this work, we study the properties of miniclusters in the different approaches used in the literature. We find that, while there are substantial differences in the mass distribution and internal density profiles, globally there is a similar energy distribution between minicluster halos and voids.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2307.10904": "2023-07-20, **A Parametric Study of the SASI Comparing General Relativistic and Non-Relativistic Treatments**, Samuel J.

Using GR hydrodynamics and gravity, and non-relativistic (NR) hydrodynamics and gravity, in an idealized model setting, we vary the initial radius of the shock and, by varying its mass and radius in concert, the proto-neutron star (PNS) compactness. We investigate two regimes expected in a post-bounce core-collapse supernova (CCSN): one meant to resemble a relatively low-compactness configuration and one meant to resemble a relatively high-compactness configuration. We find that GR leads to a longer SASI oscillation period, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as large as 1.29 for the high-compactness suite. We also find that GR leads to a slower SASI growth rate, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as low as 0.47 for the high-compactness suite.

We report on the detection of multiperiod brightness variability caused by pulsations. A beating of close periods, the main one of 73 days and additional ones of 68 and 70 days, leads to amplitude variations. We have also detected a long-term sine trend in brightness with a period of nearly 1800 days. We suppose it to be orbital and IRAS 07253-2001 to be binary. Based on new low-resolution spectroscopic data obtained with the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasian mountain observatory in 2020 and 2023 in the $\\lambda$3500-7500 wavelength range we have identified spectral lines and compiled a spectral atlas. We have found the [N II], [Ni II] and [S II] forbidden emission lines in the spectrum and discuss their origin. The H$\\alpha$ line has a variable double-peaked emission component.

Moriya et.al., [2307.10553v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10553v1)\n\n Some interaction-powered supernovae have long rise times of more than 100 days. We show that such long rise times are naturally expected if circumstellar matters (CSM) have a flat density structure (s <~ 1.5, where rho\\_CSM ~ r^{-s}). In such cases, bolometric luminosities from the CSM interaction keep increasing as long as the CSM interacts with the outer layers of the SN ejecta. Thus, the rise time is determined by the dynamical timescale in which the reverse shock propagates the outer layers of the SN ejecta, not by the timescales in which photons diffuse in the CSM as often considered. Interaction-powered supernovae with very long rise times can be an important probe of extensive non-steady mass loss in massive stars.\n\n", "2307.10426": "2023-07-19, **The CluMPR Galaxy Cluster-Finding Algorithm and DESI Legacy Survey Galaxy Cluster Catalogue**, M. J.

We here present a new cluster-finding algorithm, CluMPR (Clusters from Masses and Photometric Redshifts), that exploits photometric redshifts (photo-z's) as well as photometric stellar mass measurements. CluMPR uses a 2-dimensional binary search tree to search for overdensities of massive galaxies with similar redshifts on the sky and then probabilistically assigns cluster membership by accounting for photo-z uncertainties. We leverage the deep DESI Legacy Surveys grzW1W2 imaging over one-third of the sky to create a catalogue of ~ 300,000 galaxy cluster candidates out to z = 1, including tabulations of member galaxies and estimates of each cluster's total stellar mass. Compared to other methods, CluMPR is particularly effective at identifying clusters at the high end of the redshift range considered (z = 0.75-1), with minimal contamination from low-mass groups. These characteristics make it ideal for identifying strongly lensed high-redshift supernovae and quasars that are powerful probes of cosmology, dark matter, and stellar astrophysics. As an example application of this cluster catalogue, we present a catalogue of candidate wide-angle strongly-lensed quasars in Appendix C. The five best candidates identified from this sample include two known lensed quasar systems and a possible changing-look lensed QSO with SDSS spectroscopy.

In this paper we have studied the science capabilities of a network of LIGO detectors when they reach their best possible sensitivity, called A#, and a new generation of observatories that are factor of 10 to 100 times more sensitive (depending on the frequency), in particular a pair of L-shaped Cosmic Explorer observatories (one 40 km and one 20 km arm length) in the US and the triangular Einstein Telescope with 10 km arms in Europe. We use a set of science metrics derived from the top priorities of several funding agencies to characterize the science capabilities of different networks. The presence of one or two A# observatories in a network containing two or one next generation observatories, respectively, will provide good localization capabilities for facilitating multimessenger astronomy and precision measurement of the Hubble parameter. A network of two Cosmic Explorer observatories and the Einstein Telescope is critical for accomplishing all the identified science metrics including the nuclear equation of state, cosmological parameters, growth of black holes through cosmic history, and make new discoveries such as the presence of dark matter within or around neutron stars and black holes, continuous gravitational waves from rotating neutron stars, transient signals from supernovae, and the production of stellar-mass black holes in the early universe. For most metrics the triple network of next generation terrestrial observatories are a factor 100 better than what can be accomplished by a network of three A# observatories.\n\n", "2307.10354": "2023-07-19, **Neutron Star Mergers and their Impact on Second Generation Star Formation in the Early Universe**, Danielle Skinner et.al., [2307.10354v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10354v1)\n\n The exact evolution of elements in the universe, from primordial hydrogen and helium to heavier elements like gold and platinum produced via the r-process, is still under scrutiny. The supernova deaths of the very first stars to form in the universe led to the enrichment of their local environments with new metals, and can leave behind neutron stars as remnants. These remnants can end up in binary systems with other neutron stars, and eventually merge, allowing for the r-process to occur. In this work, we study the scenario where a single neutron star merger (NSM) enriches a halo early in its evolution to understand the impact on the second generation of stars and their metal abundances. We perform a suite of high resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations using Enzo where we have implemented a new NSM model varying the explosion energy and the delay time. In general, a NSM leads to a significant r-process enhancement in the second generation of stars. A high explosion energy leads to almost all enhanced r-process stars being highly enhanced, while a lower explosion energy leads to a higher mass fraction of stars being r-process enhanced, but not as many being highly enhanced. When a NSM has a short delay time, there is a higher mass fraction of stars being r-process enhanced, but a smaller mass fraction being highly enhanced compared to longer delay times. This work represents a stepping stone towards understanding how NSMs impact their environments and metal abundances of descendant generations of stars.\n\n", "2307.09917": "2023-07-19, **Photospheric velocity evolution of SN 2020bvc: signature of $r$-process nucleosynthesis from a collapsar**, Long Li et.al., [2307.09917v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09917v1)\n\n Whether binary neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical site of rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) nucleosynthesis remains unknown. Collapsars associated with long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and hypernovae are promising candidates. Simulations have shown that outflows from collapsar accretion disks can produce enough $r$-process materials to explain the abundances in the universe. However, there is no observational evidence to confirm this result at present. SN 2020bvc is a broad-lined type Ic (Ic-BL) supernova (SN) possibly associated with a low-luminosity GRB. Based on semi-analytic SN emission models with and without $r$-process materials, we perform a fitting to the multi-band light curves and photospheric velocities of SN 2020bvc. We find that in a $r$-process-enriched model the mixing of $r$-process materials slows down the photospheric recession and therefore matches the velocity evolution better. The fitting results show that $r$-process materials with mass of $\\approx0.36~M\\_\\odot$ and opacity of $\\approx4~\\rm cm^2~g^{-1}$ is needed to mix with about half of the SN ejecta. Our fitting results are weakly dependent on the nebular emission.
