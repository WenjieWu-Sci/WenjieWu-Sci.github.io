In this work, we study models with a sector of dark radiation with a step in its abundance, which thermalizes after big bang nucleosynthesis by mixing with the standard model neutrinos. For this, we extend an earlier work which has focused on the background evolution only until the dark sector thermalizes by deriving the full background and perturbation equations of the model and implementing them in an Einstein-Boltzmann solving code. We expound on the behavior of this model, discussing the wide range of parameters that result in interesting and viable cosmologies that dynamically generate dark radiation during a range of epochs. We find that for the strongly self-coupled regime, there is no large cosmological impact for a tight prior on the mass, whereas larger mass ranges allow a smooth interpolation between a behavior close to the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological standard model and close to an additional component of strongly self-interacting dark radiation. In the weakly self-coupled regime we find that we can accommodate a parameter space relevant for the neutrino anomalies as well as one relevant to easing the Hubble tension.\n\n", "2404.16805": "2024-04-25, **Accelerated inference on accelerated cosmic expansion: New constraints on axion-like early dark energy with DESI BAO and ACT DR6 CMB lensing**, Frank J.

Such quantum effect significantly enhances the lifetime, rendering the possibility of PBH mass $\\lesssim 10^{9}$ g being the sole dark matter (DM) candidate. However, Nature can not rule out the existence of fundamental particles such as DM. We, therefore, include the possibility of populating the dark sector by the decay of PBHs to those fundamental particles, adding the contribution to stable PBH whose lifetime is extended due to the quantum corrections.

Our treatment incorporates all relevant physical effects including the dark matter trajectories, nuclear form factors, and radial profiles for the white dwarf escape velocity and target number densities. Our capture rates differ by orders of magnitude from previous estimates, which have typically used approximations developed for dark matter scattering in the Earth. We also compute the time for the dark matter to thermalize in the center of the white dwarf, including in-medium effects such as phonon emission and absorption from the ionic lattice in the case where the star has a crystallized core. We find much shorter thermalization timescales than previously estimated, especially if the white dwarf core has crystallized.

Given the expectation of a universal profile in dark matter-only simulations, the diversity of observed rotation curves has become an often-discussed issue in Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology on galactic scales. We analyze a suite of Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations of $10^{10}-10^{12}$ $M\\_\\odot$ halos with standard cold dark matter, and compare the true circular velocity to rotation curve reconstructions. We find that, for galaxies with well-ordered gaseous disks, the measured rotation curve may deviate from true circular velocity by at most 10% within the radius of the disk. However, non-equilibrium behavior, non-circular motions, and non-thermal and non-kinetic stresses may cause much larger discrepancies of 50% or more. Most rotation curve reconstructions underestimate the true circular velocity, while some reconstructions transiently over-estimate it in the central few kiloparsecs due to dynamical phenomena. We further demonstrate that the features that contribute to these failures are not always visibly obvious in HI observations.

Within $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) simulations, Milky Way-like galaxies accrete some of their satellite galaxies in groups of 3-5 members rather than individually. It was also suggested that this might be the reason behind the origin of satellite planes. Objects accreted in groups are expected to share similar specific total energy and angular momentum, and also identical orbital planes and directions. Aims. Looking at observations of Milky Way satellites, the dwarf galaxies Leo II, IV, V, Crater II, and the star cluster Crater 1 were proposed to be a vestige of group infall. The suggested \"Crater-Leo group\" shows a coherent distance gradient and all these objects align along a great circle on the sky. We use proper motion data to investigate whether the phase-space distribution of the members of the proposed group are indeed consistent with group infall. Methods. To further investigate this possibility, we use Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) proper motions, $(\\mu\\_{\\alpha*}, \\mu\\_\\delta) = (-0.1921 \\pm 0.0514, -0.0686 \\pm 0.0523)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Leo IV and $(\\mu\\_{\\alpha*}, \\mu\\_\\delta) = (0.1186 \\pm 0.1943, -0.1183 \\pm 0.1704)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Leo V, to derive accurate orbital properties for the proposed group objects.

However, our results suggest that Crater II was not accreted with the rest of the objects.

If the inflaton $\\phi$ oscillates around the minimum of a monomial potential $\\propto \\phi^{n}$, we reveal the emergence of resonance phenomena originating from the dynamic evolution of the inflaton mass for $n>2$. Consequently, a resonance appears in both the radiation and the temperature evolution during the reheating process. By solving the coupled Boltzmann equations, we present solutions for radiation and temperature. We find non-trivial temperature characteristics during reheating, depending on the value of $n$ and the masses of the inflaton and mediator. Some phenomenological aspects of the model are explored. As a concrete example, we show that the same mediator participates in the genesis of dark matter, modifying the standard freeze-in dynamics.

Interestingly, the scenario predicts long-lived particles decaying into dark matter with lifetimes favorably coinciding with the range that can be resolved at the LHC. However, the small mass splitting between the long-lived particle and dark matter renders the decay products soft, challenging current search strategies. We consider four different classes of searches covering the entire range of lifetimes: heavy stable charge particles, disappearing tracks, displaced vertices, and missing energy searches. We discuss the applicability of these searches to conversion-driven freeze-out and derive current constraints highlighting their complementarity. For the displaced vertices search, we demonstrate how a slight modification of the current analysis significantly improves its sensitivity to the scenario.\n\n", "2404.15998": "2024-04-24, **Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter: testing the viability of weak gravity conjecture and weak cosmic censorship conjecture simultaneously**, Jafar Sadeghi et.al., [2404.15998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15998v1)\n\n A possible violation of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) by cosmic censorship is one of the major challenges in the field of general relativity. However, in this paper, we explore the possibility of reconciling the WGC and the WCCC by considering Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om (R-N) black holes embedded in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) in asymptotically flat spacetimes. These two conjectures are seemingly unrelated, but a recent proposal suggested that they are connected surprisingly. In particular, We argue a promising class of valid counterexamples to the WCCC in the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory, considering a charged black hole when WGC is present. We demonstrate that by imposing certain constraints on the parameters of the metric, the WGC and the WCCC can be compatible. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the charged black hole in the presence of PFDM for $Q > M$ and present some intriguing figures to test the validity of the WGC and the WCCC simultaneously. When PFDM is absent ($\\gamma=0$), the RN black hole either has two event horizons if $Q^2/M^2\\leq 1$ or none if $Q^2/M^2> 1$. The second scenario results in a naked singularity, which contradicts the WCCC. But when PFDM is present ($\\gamma\\neq 0$), the RN black hole has event horizons with regard to Q and M. This implies that the singularity is always covered, and the WGC and the WCCC are fulfilled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is a critical value of $\\gamma$, called $\\gamma\\_{ext}$, that makes the RN black hole extremal when $\\gamma=\\gamma\\_{ext}$. In this situation, the black hole has an event horizon, and the WGC and the WCCC are still fulfilled.

Our independent calculation verifies earlier results where the leading contribution at order ${\\cal{O}}(T^2)$ was shown to be proportional to the square of the fermion mass in the non-relativistic limit, just as at leading order.

The WGC ensures that gravity remains the weakest force in the system. Meanwhile, the WCCC addresses the cosmic censorship problem by preventing the violation of fundamental physical laws near the black hole singularity. First, we analyze the RN black hole's free energy in both spaces, revealing a distinctive swallowtail pattern indicative of a first-order phase transition when certain free parameter conditions are met. We explore the WGC across different phase spaces, emphasizing the need for certain conditions in EPST, RPST, and CFT. We demonstrate that PFDM $( \\gamma )$ and the radius of AdS ($l$) have a vital role in proving the satisfaction of the WGC. Also, these values have a linear relation with the range compatibility of WGC. The range of compatibility for WGC in RPST and EPST is the same while for CFT, this range is larger than EPST, and RPST. It means somehow the WGC and CFT are more consistent. The WCCC was examined at the critical juncture, confirming its validity with $( f(M\\_c, Q\\_c, r\\_c) = 0 )$.

When these presumably primordial global interactions switch off, the local action recovers full invariance and so the usual two gravitons, but a legacy matter component is left over, bearing the extra degree of freedom. Under the assumption that the preferred foliation is geodesic, this component behaves like dark matter, except that 3 of its 4 local degrees of freedom are frozen, forcing its rest frame to coincide with the preferred foliation. The non-frozen degree of freedom (the number density of the effective fluid) is the survivor of the extra \"graviton\" present in the initial theory, and keeps memory of all the past global interactions that took place in a given location in the preferred foliation. Such \"painted-on\" dark matter is best distinguished from the conventional one in situations where the preferred frame would be preposterous if all 4 degrees of freedom of dark matter were available. We provide one example: an outflowing halo of legacy matter with exact escape speed at each point and a very specific profile, surrounding a condensed structure made of normal matter.\n\n", "2404.15741": "2024-04-24, **First measurement of Gallium Arsenide as a low-temperature calorimeter**, D. L. Helis et.al., [2404.15741v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15741v1)\n\n In this paper, we present the first measurement of a Gallium Arsenide crystal working as low-temperature calorimeter for direct Dark Matter (DM) searches within the DAREDEVIL (DARk-mattEr DEVIces for Low energy detection) project. In the quest for direct dark matter detection, innovative approaches to lower the detection thershold and explore the sub-GeV mass DM range, have gained high relevance in the last decade. This study presents the pioneering use of Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) as a low-temperature calorimeter for probing the dark matter-electron interaction channel. Our experimental setup features a GaAs crystal at ultralow temperature of 15 mK, coupled with a Neutron Transmutation Doped (NTD) thermal sensor for precise energy estimation. This configuration is the first step towards the detection of single electrons scattered by dark matter particles within the GaAs crystal, to significantly improve the sensitivity to low-mass dark matter candidates.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2404.16570": "2024-04-25, **STELLA lightcurves of energetic pair instability supernovae in the context of SN2018ibb**, Chris Nagele et.al., [2404.16570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16570v1)\n\n SN2018ibb is a recently observed hydrogen poor super-luminous supernova which appears to be powered by the decay of $30\\;\\rm{M\\_\\odot}$ of radioactive nickel. This supernova has been suggested to show hybrid signatures of a pair instability supernova and an interacting supernova. In a previous paper, we found that rotating, metal enriched pair instability supernova progenitors appeared to check both of these boxes. In this paper, we model the lightcurves of the pair instability supernovae using STELLA. We find that the STELLA models can explain the overall shape of the bolometric lightcurve of SN2018ibb, though not specific morphological features such as the luminosity peak or the bump at roughly three hundred days after the peak. We also estimate the contribution from interaction, and find that with relatively low wind velocities, the circum-stellar medium originating from the stellar winds is consistent with the evidence for interaction in the spectra. The observed values of the photosphere velocity in the hundred days after peak luminosity are similar to the STELLA models, but the deceleration is lower. This leads to the biggest inconsistency which is the black body temperature of SN2018ibb being much hotter than any of the STELLA models. We note that this high temperature (and the flat velocity) may be difficult to reconcile with the long rise time of SN2018ibb, but nevertheless conclude that if it is accurate, this discrepancy represents a challenge for SN2018ibb being a robust PISN candidate. This result is noteworthy given the lack of other scenarios for this supernova.\n\n", "2404.16261": "2024-04-25, **Reconstructing Cosmic History: JWST-Extended Mapping of the Hubble Flow from z$ \\sim $0 to z$ \\sim$7.5 with HII Galaxies**, Ricardo Ch\u00e1vez et.al., [2404.16261v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16261v1)\n\n Over twenty years ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) [arXiv:astro-ph/9805201, arXiv:astro-ph/9812133] observations revealed an accelerating Universe expansion, suggesting a significant dark energy presence, often modelled as a cosmological constant, $\\Lambda$. Despite its pivotal role in cosmology, the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model remains largely underexplored in the redshift range between distant SNIa and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This study harnesses the James Webb Space Telescope's advanced capabilities to extend the Hubble flow mapping across an unprecedented redshift range, from $z \\approx 0$ to $z \\approx 7.5$. Utilising a dataset of 231 HII galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, we employ the $\\text{L}-\\sigma$ relation, correlating the luminosity of Balmer lines with their velocity dispersion, to define a competitive technique for measuring cosmic distances. This approach maps the Universe's expansion over more than 12 billion years, covering 95\\% of its age.

To minimize statistical uncertainty and mitigate sensitivity to systematic errors in any single anchor distance determination, SH0ES combines Cepheids from various observations, including those from Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) host galaxies, NGC 4258, and closer galaxies (MW, LMC, SMC, and M31), although this mixed sample may introduce unknown or subtle systematic errors due to comparing distant and closer Cepheids. To address this, we propose a subset excluding Cepheids from the closer galaxies, retaining only the NGC 4258 water megamasers as a single anchor, circumventing potential systematic errors associated with observational methods and reduction techniques. Focusing solely on these Cepheids yields competitive statistical errors, approximately $2.5\\%$, sufficient to identify a $\\approx3\\sigma$ tension with the \\textit{Planck} $H\\_0$ value. Our approach offers an opportunity to utilize optical photometry with systematic uncertainty smaller than the statistical uncertainty, potentially achieving higher precision than NIR photometry, given the lower optical background. However, currently the optical photometry sample's fidelity does not match that of NIR photometry. The significant Hubble tension obtained is unrelated to Cepheids and we discuss other options.\n\n", "2404.15977": "2024-04-24, **Kinetic Model for Dark Energy -- Dark Matter Interaction: Scenario for the Hubble Tension**, Giovanni Montani et.al., [2404.15977v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15977v1)\n\n We analyze a model for Dark Energy - Dark Matter interaction, based on a decaying process of the former constituents into the latter ones. The dynamical equations are constructed following a kinetic formulation, which separates the interacting fluctuations from equilibrium distribution of the both the species. The emerging dynamical picture consists of coupled equations, which are specialized in the case of a Dark Energy equation of state parameter: we deal with a modified Lambda Cold Dark Matter model, which is investigated versus a possible interpretation of the Hubble tension. We compare our model with data corresponding to 6 points of the expansion rate from Type Ia Supernovae. We show that, the proposed model suitably fits data according to a value of the Hubble constant compatible with the SHOES Collaboration measurement. The tension is solved because, essentially for redshift greater than one, the correction to the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model vanishes and its presence does not affect the Planck measurements.\n\n", "2404.15953": "2024-04-24, **Population synthesis of Galactic pulsars with machine learning**, Michele Ronchi et.al., [2404.15953v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15953v1)\n\n This thesis work represents the first efforts to combine population synthesis studies of the Galactic isolated neutron stars with deep-learning techniques with the aim of better understanding neutron-star birth properties and evolution. In particular, we develop a flexible population-synthesis framework to model the dynamical and magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars, their emission in radio and their detection with radio telescopes. We first study the feasibility of using deep neural networks to infer the dynamical properties at birth and then explore a simulation-based inference approach to predict the birth magnetic-field and spin-period distributions and the late-time magnetic-field decay for the observed radio pulsar population. Our results for the birth magneto-rotational properties agree with the findings of previous works while we constrain the late-time evolution of the magnetic field in neutron stars for the first time. Moreover, this thesis also studies possible scenarios to explain the puzzling nature of recently discovered periodic radio sources with very long periods of the order of thousands of seconds. In particular, by assuming a neutron-star origin, we study the spin-period evolution of a newborn neutron star interacting with a supernova fallback disk and find that the combination of strong, magnetar-like magnetic fields and moderate accretion rates can lead to very large spin periods on timescales of ten thousands of years. Moreover, we perform population synthesis studies to assess the possibility for these sources to be either neutron stars or magnetic white dwarfs emitting coherently through magnetic dipolar losses. These discoveries have opened up a new perspective on the neutron-star population and have started to question our current understanding of how coherent radio emission is produced in pulsar magnetospheres.\n\n", "2404.15913": "2024-04-24, **Constraints on Cosmological Models from Quasars Calibrated with Type Ia Supernova by a Gaussian Process**, Haixiang Zhang et.al., [2404.15913v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15913v1)\n\n In this paper, we use quasars calibrated from type Ia supernova (SN Ia) to constrain cosmological models. We consider three different X-ray luminosity ($L\\_{X}$) - ultraviolet luminosity ($L\\_{UV}$) relations of quasars, i.e., the standard $L\\_{X}$-$L\\_{UV}$ relation and two redshift-evolutionary relations (Type I and Type II) respectively constructed from copula and considering a redshift correction to the luminosity of quasars.

Furthermore, we show that, when the observational Hubble data (OHD) are added, the constraints on the absolute magnitude $M$ of SN Ia and the Hubble constant $H\\_0$ can be obtained. In the $\\Lambda$CDM model, the OHD measurements plus quasars with the Type I relation yields $M$ =$-19.321^{+0.085}\\_{-0.076}$, which is in good agreement with the measurement from SH0ES ($M=-19.253\\pm{0.027}$), and $H\\_0$ = $70.80\\pm3.6~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$, falling between the measurements from SH0ES and the Planck cosmic microwave background radiation data.\n\n"}}
