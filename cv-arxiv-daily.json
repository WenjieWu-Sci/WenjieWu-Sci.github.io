Typically, these effects are studied independently; however, it may be necessary to combine both to perform a consistent analysis. In this work, we study the interplay between time-of-flight anomalies and neutrino instability in the context of a flavor-independent high-energy Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) in the neutrino sector. Ensuring compatibility between both types of effects imposes strong constraints on the existence of early neutrinos with energies exceeding a maximum value determined by the scale of new physics. Such constraints depend on the specific LIV scenario and should be integrated into searches for high-energy neutrinos from gamma-ray bursts exhibiting LIV time shifts.\n\n", "2310.12642": "2023-10-19, **Semi-inclusive two-nucleon emission in (anti) neutrino CC scattering within the relativistic mean field framework**, V.

The outcomes are presented in terms of one-fold and two-fold integrated semi-inclusive cross sections. To highlight disparities among the various emission channels, including proton-proton, neutron-proton, and neutron-neutron, we compare them against a purely phase-space isotropic distribution within the center of mass of the two nucleons.

The target neutrino-mass sensitivity of 0.2 eV / c^2 at 90% C.L. can only be achieved in the case of high statistics and a good control of the systematic uncertainties. One key systematic effect originates from the calculation of the molecular final states of T\\_2 beta decay. In the first neutrino-mass analyses of KATRIN the contribution of the uncertainty of the molecular final-states distribution (FSD) was estimated via a conservative phenomenological approach to be 0.02 eV^2 / c^4. In this paper a new procedure is presented for estimating the FSD-related uncertainties by considering the details of the final-states calculation, i.e. the uncertainties of constants, parameters, and functions used in the calculation as well as its convergence itself as a function of the basis-set size used in expanding the molecular wave functions. The calculated uncertainties are directly propagated into the experimental observable, the squared neutrino mass m\\_nu^2.

Examples of such long-lived fermions are heavy neutral leptons which can mix with the standard-model active neutrinos, and the bino-like lightest neutralino in R-parity-violating supersymmetry. We show that the Standard Model Effective Field Theory extended with right-handed singlet neutrinos can simultaneously describe heavy neutral leptons and bino-like neutralinos in a unified manner.

Measuring their flavor composition would reveal information about their production and propagation, but it is unclear if planned UHE neutrino telescopes will have the capabilities to do it. We circumvent this by proposing a new way to measure the UHE neutrino flavor composition that does not rely on individual telescopes having flavor-identification capabilities. We manufacture flavor sensitivity from the joint detection by one telescope sensitive to all flavors -- the radio array of IceCube-Gen2 -- and one mostly sensitive to $\\nu\\_\\tau$ -- GRAND. From this limited flavor sensitivity, predominantly to $\\nu\\_\\tau$, and even under conservative choices of neutrino flux and detector size, we extract important insight.

Using the Mandelstam-Tamm method, TEUR has been recently derived for neutrino oscillations by connecting the uncertainty on neutrino energy with the characteristic time-scale of oscillations. Interestingly enough, the suggestive interpretation of neutrinos as unstable-like particles has proved to naturally emerge in this context. Further aspects have been later discussed in semiclassical gravity by computing corrections to the neutrino energy uncertainty in a generic stationary curved spacetime, and in quantum field theory, where the clock observable turns out to be identified with the non-conserved flavor charge operator. In the present work, we give an overview on the above achievements. In particular, we analyze the implications of TEUR and explore the impact of gravitational and non-relativistic effects on the standard condition for neutrino oscillations.

The same can, however, be explained by incorporating two additional scalar doublets whose only role is to contribute radiatively to diphoton decay modes of the light, neutral scalars.

This alpha/beta discrimination, first demonstrated at the tonne scale in the Counting Test Facility prototype, was used throughout the lifetime of the experiment between 2007 and 2021. With this method, alpha events are identified and subtracted from the beta-like solar neutrino events. This is particularly important in liquid scintillator as alpha scintillation is quenched many-fold. In Borexino, the prominent Po-210 decay peak was a background in the energy range of electrons scattered from Be-7 solar neutrinos. Optimal alpha-beta discrimination was achieved with a \"multi-layer perceptron neural network\", which its higher ability to leverage the timing information of the scintillation photons detected by the photomultiplier tubes. An event-by-event, high efficiency, stable, and uniform pulse shape discrimination was essential in characterising the spatial distribution of background in the detector. This benefited most Borexino measurements, including solar neutrinos in the \\pp chain and the first direct observation of the CNO cycle in the Sun.

However, so far there has been no direct observational evidence of hadronic emission from GRBs. The B.O.A.T.

Here we perform a comprehensive spectral analysis of the GRB from keV to TeV energy range and perform detailed spectral and light curve modelings considering both the traditional synchrotron self-Compton process and the electromagnetic (EM) cascade process initiated by hadronic interactions by accelerated cosmic rays in the external shock. We find that the leptonic scenario alone is not adequate to account for the observations, whereas the proposed scenario with the combination of hadronic and leptonic components can well reproduce the multi-wavelength spectra and the light curve. This result reveals the existence of the accelerated hadronic component in the early afterglow of this extreme burst.

We study the lepto-hadronic scenario for the observed multiband spectra of these LHAASO sources considering the possible counterpart source of the LHAASO sources. The very-high-energy gamma rays are entirely attributed to the hadronic contribution, therefore the most optimistic neutrino flux can be derived. Then, we evaluate the statistical significance (p-value) as the observational time of the IceCube and next-generation IceCube-Gen2 neutrino observatory respectively.

Accordingly, in the paper, we introduce a novel calibration method in which the beam of the target material (instead of neutrons) will be implemented to impinge the detector. For instance, calibrating a liquid helium detector with a helium beam. Since the helium beam can (i) be tuned precisely to have $\\sim < $1\\% energy jitter (so as the recoil energy's uncertainty), (ii) have an energy interval from $\\sim$ 100 eV to tens of keV (depending on the configuration), and (iii) have a tunable flux down to 10$^{10}$/s.

Despite the similarity in velocity space between the gas and dark matter accretion patterns onto filaments and their central clusters, we confirm some differences, especially concerning the more ordered radial velocity dispersion of dark matter around the cluster and the larger accretion velocity of gas relative to dark matter in filaments. We also study the distribution of shocked gas around filaments and galaxy clusters, showing that the surrounding shocks allow an efficient internal transport of material, suggesting a laminar infall. The stacked temperature profile of filaments is typically colder towards the spine, in line with the cosmological rarefaction of matter. Therefore, filaments are able to isolate their inner regions, maintaining lower gas temperatures and entropy.

The low surface brightness of these galaxies ($\\mu\\_r$(0)$>26$ mag/arcsec^2), and hence their low surface stellar mass density (a few solar masses per pc^2 or less), suggests that the energy density released by baryonic feedback mechanisms is inefficient in modifying the distribution of the dark matter halos they inhabit.

We perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis to constrain the cosmological parameters $\\Omega\\_{\\mathrm{m}}$, $\\sigma\\_8$ and the structure growth parameter $S\\_8\\equiv\\sigma\\_8 \\sqrt{\\Omega\\_{\\mathrm{m}}/0.3}$. We adopt Gaussian priors on the parameters of the mass-richness relation, based on the posterior distributions derived from a previous joint analysis of cluster counts and weak lensing mass measurements carried out with the same catalogue. From the angular correlation function, we obtain $\\Omega\\_{\\mathrm{m}}=0.32^{+0.05}\\_{-0.04}$, $\\sigma\\_8=0.77^{+0.13}\\_{-0.09}$ and $S\\_8=0.80^{+0.08}\\_{-0.06}$, in agreement, within $1\\sigma$, with 3D clustering result based on the same cluster sample and with existing complementary studies on other datasets. For the angular power spectrum, we derive statistically consistent results, in particular $\\Omega\\_{\\mathrm{m}}=0.24^{+0.05}\\_{-0.04}$ and $S\\_8=0.93^{+0.11}\\_{-0.12}$, while the constraint on $\\sigma\\_8$ alone is weaker with respect to the one provided by the angular correlation function, $\\sigma\\_8=1.01^{+0.25}\\_{-0.17}$. Our results show that the 2D clustering from photometric cluster surveys can provide competitive cosmological constraints with respect to the full 3D clustering statistics, and can be successfully applied to ongoing and forthcoming spectro/photometric surveys.\n\n", "2310.12217": "2023-10-18, **Galaxy formation with Wave/Fuzzy Dark Matter: The core-halo structure**, Alvaro Pozo et.al., [2310.12217v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12217v1)\n\n Dark matter-dominated cores have long been claimed for the well-studied local group dwarf galaxies. More recently, extended stellar halos have been uncovered around several of these dwarfs through deeper imaging and spectroscopy. Such core-halo structures are not a feature of conventional cold dark matter (CDM), based on collisionless particles where smooth, scale-free profiles are predicted. In contrast, smooth and prominent dark matter cores are predicted for Warm and Fuzzy/Wave Dark Matter (WDM/$\\psi$DM) respectively. The question arises to what extent the visible stellar profiles should reflect this dark matter core structure. Here we compare cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of CDM, WDM $\\&$ $\\psi$DM, aiming to predict the stellar profiles for these three DM scenarios. We show that cores surrounded by extended halos are distinguishable for WDM and $\\psi$DM, with the most prominent cores in the case of $\\psi$DM, where the stellar density is enhanced in the core due to the presence of the relatively dense soliton. Our analysis demonstrates that such behavior does not appear in CDM, implying that the small-scale cut-off in the power spectrum present for WDM and $\\psi$DM provides a core-halo transition. Consequently, we estimate the mass of the $\\psi$DM particle at this core-halo transition point. Furthermore, we observe the anticipated asymmetry for $\\psi$DM due to the soliton's random walk, a distinctive characteristic not found in the symmetric distributions of stars in Warm and CDM models.\n\n", "2310.12114": "2023-10-18, **Dissipationless collapse and the dynamical mass-ellipticity relation of elliptical galaxies in Newtonian gravity and MOND**, Pierfrancesco Di Cintio et.al., [2310.12114v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12114v1)\n\n Context. Deur (2014) and Winters et al. (2023) proposed an empirical relation between the dark to total mass ratio and ellipticity in elliptical galaxies from their observed total dynamical mass-to-light ratio data M/L = (14.1 +/- 5.4){\\epsilon}. In other words, the larger is the content of dark matter in the galaxy, the more the stellar component would be flattened. Such observational claim, if true, appears to be in stark contrast with the common intuition of the formation of galaxies inside dark halos with reasonably spherical symmetry. Aims. Comparing the processes of dissipationless galaxy formation in different theories of gravity, and emergence of the galaxy scaling relations therein is an important frame where, in principle one could discriminate them. Methods. By means of collisionless N-body simulations in modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity with and without active dark matter halos, with both spherical and clumpy initial structure, I study the trends of intrinsic and projected ellipticities, S\\'ersic index and anisotropy with the total dynamical to stellar mass ratio. Results. It is shown that, the end products of both cold spherical collapses and mergers of smaller clumps depart more and more from the spherical symmetry for increasing values of the total dynamical mass to stellar mass, at least in a range of halo masses. The equivalent Newtonian systems of the end products of MOND collapses show a similar behaviour. The M/L relation obtained from the numerical experiments in both gravities is however rather different from that reported by Deur and coauthors.\n\n", "2310.11955": "2023-10-18, **Exploring the Potential of Residual Impurities in Germanium Detectors for Low-Mass Dark Matter Detection**, Dongming Mei et.al., [2310.11955v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11955v1)\n\n The pursuit of low-mass dark matter detection hinges on achieving an unprecedentedly low energy detection threshold. Germanium (Ge) detectors, when meticulously tailored with precise impurity compositions, hold the promise of expanding their sensitivity to energy levels below the sub-electronvolt (sub-eV) range. In this study, we embark on an exploration of residual impurities inherent to Ge detectors, focusing on their behavior at helium temperatures. These impurity atoms undergo a captivating freeze-out phenomenon, transitioning into localized states known as excited dipole states. Through compelling evidence derived from the measurement of relative capacitance, we elucidate the transition of impurity atoms from free charge states to these localized dipole states, as the temperature plummets from 11 K to 6.5 K. Our investigation encompasses the intricate formation of these dipole states in both n-type and p-type impurities. Furthermore, we shed light on the electric field generated by these dipole states, unveiling their capacity to ensnare charges and foster the creation of cluster dipole states. Drawing from prior measurements, we affirm that these excited dipole states exhibit a binding energy of less than 10 meV, thus forging a path toward an exceptionally low detection threshold for low-mass dark matter. Capitalizing on this concept, we propose the development of a 1-kg Ge detector equipped with internal charge amplification, an innovative approach poised to surpass electrical noise and, in turn, empower the detection of low-mass dark matter with unprecedented sensitivity.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2310.12463": "2023-10-19, **Piecewise frequency model for searches for long-transient gravitational waves from young neutron stars**, Benjamin Grace et.al., [2310.12463v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12463v1)\n\n Previous searches for a gravitational-wave signal from a possible neutron star remnant of the binary neutron star merger event GW170817 have focused on short ($<500$ s) and long duration (2.5 hr -- 8 day) signals. To date, no such post-merger signal has been detected. We introduce a new piecewise model which has the flexibility to accurately follow gravitational-wave signals which are rapidly evolving in frequency, such as those which may be emitted from young neutron stars born from binary neutron star mergers or supernovae. We investigate the sensitivity and computational cost of this piecewise model when used in a fully coherent 1800-second $\\mathcal{F}$-statistic search on simulated data containing possible signals from the GW170817 remnant. The sensitivity of the search using the piecewise model is determined using simulated data, with noise consistent with the LIGO second observing run.

We find a strong correlation between stellar mass and stellar metallicity, with stellar metallicity monotonically increasing with stellar mass at low masses and flattening at high masses ($M\\_* \\gtrsim 10^{10.3} M\\_\\odot$). Additionally, we compare our stellar metallicity measurements with the gas-phase oxygen abundance of galaxies at similar redshift and estimate the average $\\rm [\\alpha/Fe] \\sim 0.6$. Such high $\\alpha$-enhancement indicates that high-redshift galaxies have not yet undergone significant iron enrichment through Type Ia supernovae.

We model their sparse available observations using the stellar population inference code Prospector-$\\beta$ and develop a novel implementation to incorporate the galaxy mass-radius relation. Assuming these hosts are randomly drawn from the galaxy population and conditioning this draw on their observed flux and size in few photometric bands, we determine that these hosts have dwarf galaxy stellar masses of $7.0\\lesssim\\log(M\\_*/M\\_\\odot)\\lesssim9.1$. This is striking as only $14\\%$ of short GRB hosts with previous inferred stellar masses had $M\\_* \\lesssim 10^{9}\\,M\\_{\\odot}$. We further show these short GRBs have smaller physical and host-normalized offsets than the rest of the population, suggesting that the majority of their neutron star (NS) merger progenitors were retained within their hosts. The presumably shallow potentials of these hosts translate to small escape velocities of $\\sim5.5-80$ km/s, indicative of either low post-supernova systemic velocities or short inspiral times. While short GRBs with identified dwarf host galaxies now comprise $\\approx 14\\%$ of the total Swift-detected population, a number are likely missing in the current population, as larger systemic velocities (observed from Galactic NS population) would result in highly offset short GRBs and less secure host associations. However, the revelation of a population of short GRBs retained in low-mass host galaxies offers a natural explanation for observed $r$-process enrichment via NS mergers in Local Group dwarf galaxies, and has implications for gravitational wave follow-up strategies.\n\n", "2310.12090": "2023-10-18, **Chemical Analysis of the Brightest Star of the Cetus II Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxy Candidate**, K.

For this star, DES J011740.53-173053, abundances or upper limits of 18 elements from Carbon to Europium are derived. Its chemical abundances generally follow those of other UFD galaxy stars, with a slight enhancement of the alpha-elements (Mg, Si, and Ca) and low neutron-capture element (Sr, Ba, Eu) abundances supporting the classification of Cetus II as a likely UFD. The star exhibits lower Sc, Ti, and V abundances than Milky Way (MW) halo stars with similar metallicity. This signature is consistent with yields from a supernova (SN) originating from a star with a mass of ~11.2 solar masses. In addition, the star has a Potassium abundance of [K/Fe] = 0.81 which is somewhat higher than the K abundances of MW halo stars with similar metallicity, a signature which is also present in a number of UFD galaxies. A comparison including globular clusters (GC) and stellar stream stars suggests that high K is a specific characteristic for some UFD galaxy stars and can thus be used to help classify objects as UFD galaxies.\n\n", "2310.11977": "2023-10-18, **A measurement of the dark energy equation of state with 40 strong lenses**, Natalie B.

As the nearest environment in which it is possible to simultaneously observe many of the extreme processes shaping the Universe, it is one of the most well-studied regions in astrophysics. Due to its proximity, we can study the center of our Galaxy on scales down to a few hundred AU, a hundred times better than in similar Local Group galaxies and thousands of times better than in the nearest active galaxies. The Galactic Center (GC) is therefore of outstanding astrophysical interest. However, in spite of intense observational work over the past decades, there are still fundamental things unknown about the GC. JWST has the unique capability to provide us with the necessary, game-changing data. In this White Paper, we advocate for a JWST NIRCam survey that aims at solving central questions, that we have identified as a community: i) the 3D structure and kinematics of gas and stars; ii) ancient star formation and its relation with the overall history of the Milky Way, as well as recent star formation and its implications for the overall energetics of our galaxy's nucleus; and iii) the (non-)universality of star formation and the stellar initial mass function.
