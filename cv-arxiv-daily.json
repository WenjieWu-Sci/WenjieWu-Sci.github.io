If their masses are in the MeV to several GeV range, HNLs are light enough to be copiously produced at collider and accelerator facilities, but also heavy enough to decay to visible particles on length scales that can be observed in particle detectors. Previous studies evaluating the sensitivities of experiments have often focused on simple, but not particularly well-motivated, models in which the HNL mixes with only one active neutrino flavor. In this work, we accurately simulate models for HNL masses between 100 MeV and 10 GeV and arbitrary couplings to $e$, $\\mu$, and $\\tau$ leptons. We include over 150 HNL production channels and over 100 HNL decay modes, including all of the processes that can be dominant in some region of the general parameter space. The result is HNLCalc, a user-friendly, fast, and flexible library to compute the properties of HNL models. As examples, we implement HNLCalc to extend the FORESEE package to evaluate the prospects for HNL discovery at forward LHC experiments.

This newly introduced Higgs interacts directly with the quark sector, motivated by the aim to explain the flavor numbers of the fermion sector. Additionally, it undergoes mixing with the SM-like Higgs boson. The study suggests that designating this singlet Higgs state in this model as the lightest Higgs boson holds great potential for explaining the excesses around 95 GeV.

Rather than using hydrophones as receivers that are exposed to the ambient pressure, the sound signals can be coupled to piezo ceramics glued to the inside of existing containers for electronics or measuring instruments of a deep sea infrastructure. The ANTARES neutrino telescope operated from 2006 until 2022 in the Mediterranean Sea at a depth exceeding 2000m. It comprised nearly 900 glass spheres with 432mm diameter and 15mm thickness, equipped with photomultiplier tubes to detect Cherenkov light from tracks of charged elementary particles. In an experimental setup within ANTARES, piezo sensors have been glued to the inside of such - otherwise empty - glass spheres. These sensors recorded signals from acoustic emitters with frequencies from 46545 to 60235Hz. Two waves propagating through the glass sphere are found as a result of the excitation by the waves in the water. These can be qualitatively associated with symmetric and asymmetric Lamb-like waves of zeroth order: a fast (early) one with $v\\_e \\approx 5$mm/$\\mu$s and a slow (late) one with $v\\_\\ell \\approx 2$mm/$\\mu$s. Taking these findings into account improves the accuracy of the position calibration.

Here, the modular symmetry plays a crucial role as the Yukawa couplings acquire modular forms, which are expressed in terms of Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$. Therefore, the Yukawa couplings follow transformations akin to other matter fields, thereby obviating the necessity of additional flavon fields. The acquisition of $vev$ by complex modulus $\\tau$ leads to the breaking of $A\\_{4}$ modular symmetry. We have obtained predictions on neutrino oscillation parameters, for example, the model favours ( \\theta\\_{23} ) to be in the lower octant and normal hierarchy for neutrino mass spectrum.

For example, anisotropic electronic and thermal transport are thought to be beneficial for thermoelectric applications, while anisotropic mechanical properties are of interest for emerging metamaterials, and anisotropic dielectric materials have been suggested as a novel platform for dark matter detection. Understanding and tailoring anisotropy in crystals is therefore essential for the design of next-generation functional materials. To date, however, most data-driven approaches have focused on the prediction of scalar crystal properties, such as the spherically averaged dielectric tensor or the bulk and shear elastic moduli. Here, we adopt the latest approaches in equivariant graph neural networks to develop a model that can predict the full dielectric tensor of crystals. Our model, trained on the Materials Project dataset of c.a. 6,700 dielectric tensors, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in scalar dielectric prediction in addition to capturing the directional response.

These constraints allow one to deduce the effective mass $M$, which causes uncertainties in the measurement. On the other hand, if the effective mass is known, one can also deduce the constants associated with $\\xi$, and $\\eta$. The former framework also introduces an Appell function, a hypergeometric function of two variables that separately allows the analysis of macroscopic and (hypothetical) microscopic black holes. This first framework was found to decrease the radii of the null regions respective to the Schwarzschild counterpart. The shadow radius, however, behaves reversibly. The result of the numerical analysis for the latter framework revealed increased values for the photonsphere and shadow radii.

In addition, to examine the robustness of our MCMC analysis, we perform a statistical assessment using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

Using the spherically symmetric solution of Cotton gravity, we obtain the deflection angle via Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the weak lensing shear. We use five galaxy catalogs divided in 5 stellar mass bins from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7), each of which is further divided into blue star forming galaxy and red passive galaxy sub-catalogs. We find that Cotton gravity on its own has significant deviation from the measured galaxy-galaxy lensing signals, thus it cannot replace the role of dark matter.

We label these objects as Small Accreted Stellar System (SASS) stars, and we find an additional 61 similar ones in the literature. A kinematic analysis of our sample and literature stars reveals them to be fast-moving halo objects, all with retrograde motion, indicating an accretion origin. Because SASS stars are much brighter than typical UFD stars, identifying them offers promising ways towards detailed studies of early star formation environments. From the chemical abundances of SASS stars, it appears that the earliest accreted systems were likely enriched by a few supernovae whose light element yields varied from system to system. Neutron-capture elements were sparsely produced and/or diluted, with $r$-process nucleosynthesis playing a role. These insights offer a glimpse into the early formation of the Galaxy.

We find that the total p-nuclei yields are only marginally affected by the CCSN explosion prescriptions if the $\\gamma$-process production is already efficient in the stellar progenitors due to a C-O shell merger. In most of CCSN explosions from progenitors without C-O shell merger, the $\\gamma$-process yields increase with the explosion energy up to an order of magnitude, depending on the progenitor structure and the CCSN prescriptions. The trend of the p-nuclei production with the explosion energy is more complicated if we look at the production of single p-nuclei. The light p-nuclei tend to be the most enhanced with increasing the explosion energy. In particular, for the CCSN models where the $\\alpha$-rich freeze-out component is ejected, the yields of the lightest p-nuclei increase by up to three orders of magnitude. We provide the first extensive study using different sets of massive stars of the impact of varying CCSN explosion prescriptions on the production of the p-nuclei.

We also confirm that the pre-explosive production of p-nuclei in C-O shell mergers is a robust result, independently from the subsequent explosive nucleosynthesis.

We find that the temperature of SN 2017dio began to increase linearly about 20 days after the explosion. We use the $^{56}$Ni plus the ejecta-CSM interaction (CSI) model to fit the LCs of SN 2017dio, finding that the masses of the ejecta, the $^{56}$Ni, and the CSM are $\\sim$ 12.41 M$\\_\\odot$, $\\sim$ 0.17 M$\\_\\odot$, and $\\sim$ 5.82 M$\\_\\odot$, respectively. The early-time photosphere velocity and the kinetic energy of the SN are respectively {$\\sim$ 1.89 $\\times 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$} and $\\sim$ 2.66 $\\times 10^{52}$ erg, which are respectively comparable to those of SNe Ic-BL and hypernovae (HNe). We suggest that the CSM of SN 2017dio might be {from an luminous-blue-variable-like outburst or} pulsational pair instability $\\sim$ 1.2$-$11.4 yr prior to the SN explosion{, or binary mass transfer}. {Moreover,} we find that its ejecta mass is larger than those of many SNe Ic-BL, and that its $^{56}$Ni mass ($M\\_{\\rm Ni}$) is approximately equal to the mean (or median) value of $M\\_{\\rm Ni}$ of SNe Ic-BL in the literature, but lower than $M\\_{\\rm Ni}$ of prototype HNe (e.g., SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh).\n\n", "2405.07446": "2024-05-13, **A Generic Model for Persistent Radio Source around Fast Radio Bursts**, Yushan Chen et.al., [2405.07446v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07446v1)\n\n The repeated fast radio burst FRB 121102A and FRB 190520B has been reported, along with a spatially coincident, compact, persistent radio emission. In this paper, we present a parameterized one-zone model, with a basic scenario that a relativistic magnetized wind from the pulsar sweeps up the surroundings, e.g. freely expanding supernova ejecta, giving rise to a power-law distribution of electron filled between the forward shock and the termination shock. We show that via appropriate adjustment of the model parameters, we can obtain the synchrotron radio emission properties from the one-zone model bright enough to account for observation, simply and analytically fitting the observed spectra well. Through dynamical evolution of the model, we can also obtain time-varying of relevant properties. This parameterized model does not depend on concrete physical models such as central engine, instead we can constraint physical model via comparison between parameters and observation, indicating the information about the central engine and surroundings. We also discuss the synchrotron self-Compton emission in our scenario in the end, but find no clue on the counterparts at other waveband.\n\n"}}
