Motivated by open questions in neutrino physics and the absence of conclusive evidence for conventional weakly interacting massive particles, DAMSA targets MeV-to-sub-GeV dark-sector messengers with feeble couplings that can be produced in abundance at the PIP-II LINAC. By employing an ultra-short baseline of order one meter, DAMSA is uniquely positioned to overcome the beam-dump \"ceiling\" that limits sensitivity to promptly decaying particles in longer-baseline experiments. The conceptual design emphasizes a beam-dump production scheme combined with a compact detector optimized for rare decays while mitigating intense neutron-induced backgrounds inherent to high-power proton beams. To validate the experimental strategy and detector technologies, the Little DAMSA Path-Finder (LDPF) proof-of-concept experiment is proposed, focusing on axion-like particles decaying to two photons and operating with 300 MeV electron beams at FAST. Successful realization of LDPF will establish the feasibility of the DAMSA approach, enabling a broad and powerful program to explore short-lived new physics and precision Standard Model processes in a previously inaccessible regime. This conceptual design document outlines the technical details of DAMSA's physics goals, the beam facility proposals, key experimental challenges and how to overcome them, and the proposed experimental staging campaigns.\n\n", "2601.14851": "2026-01-21, **Testing the three massive neutrino paradigm: Constraints on Neutrino Properties and Interactions from Recent Experimental Data**, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Pinheiro et.al., [2601.14851v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14851v1)\n\n Neutrino physics offers unique insights into phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This thesis presents phenomenological investigations organized around three pillars: consolidation of the three-flavor oscillation paradigm, exploration of new physics viability, and precise determination of solar neutrino fluxes.   The theoretical framework introduces massive neutrinos, leptonic mixing, and flavor transitions, followed by experimental results emphasizing Borexino and NOvA data analyses.   The first pillar establishes the three-flavor framework through global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator data, providing updated determinations of mixing angles ($\u03b8\\_{12}$, $\u03b8\\_{13}$, $\u03b8\\_{23}$) and mass-squared differences ($\u0394m^2\\_{21}$, $\u0394m^2\\_{31}$), while quantifying ambiguities in mass ordering and $\u03b8\\_{23}$ octant.   The second pillar investigates Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with electrons and quarks, combining Borexino data with COHERENT's CE$\u03bd$NS measurements to establish bounds on propagation and detection couplings, excluding viable NSI parameter regions including potential LMA-D solutions.   The third pillar advances solar neutrino physics through precision flux determinations, integrating pp-chain and CNO-cycle measurements. Results show preference for high-metallicity Standard Solar Models and incompatibility between $3+1$ mixing parameters favored by Gallium experiments and solar observations.

The nature of the measurement allows a detailed investigation of nuclear ground-state modeling using a neutrino source, and gives access to a direct measurement of the neutron spectral function in a $^{12}$C nucleus. The NEUT intranuclear cascade and nuclear deexcitation \\textsc{NucDeEx} are used to simulate inelastic final-state interactions and nuclear deexcitations respectively. We find that the spectral function (SF) models perform better than relativistic mean field models in modeling both the ground state and the tail of the missing energy distribution when the NEUT cascade and nuclear excitation channels are turned on. We also find that taking into account the missing energy threshold for single nucleon knockout interactions results in all nuclear models being accepted based on the obtained $p$-values.\n\n", "2601.14497": "2026-01-20, **The failed failed-supernova scenario of M31-2014-DS1**, Noam Soker et.al., [2601.14497v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14497v1)\n\n I examine a recently proposed failed-supernova scenario for the fading of the yellow supergiant event M31-2014-DS1, and find that it requires unlikely fine-tuned parameters to work, if at all. In the failed-supernova scenario, most of the yellow supergiant collapsed to form a black hole. Due to the energy carried by neutrinos from the cooling, collapsing core, gravity decreases, leading to the ejection of a small fraction of the outer envelope, some of which remains bound. The fallback accreted gas possesses large angular-momentum fluctuations due to the pre-collapse envelope convection. The fallback material forms intermittent accretion disks around the black hole that launch jets (or disk wind), which unbind most of the bound material. The failed-supernova scenario for M31-2014-DS1 requires that only <1% of the bound material be accreted by the black hole, but the jets do not shut down the backflow for over 10 years. I find this fine-tuned requirement unlikely. I also find that, due to the rapid radiative cooling of the outflow interaction zone with the outer gas, the expected radiation is about an order of magnitude or more above the observed value. These, as well as earlier challenges raised against the failed-supernova scenario, make the alternative type II intermediate-luminosity optical transient scenario, in which fading is due to dust ejection in a violent binary interaction, more likely. The fading event M31-2014-DS1 does not support the failed-supernova scenario predicted by the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.\n\n", "2601.14450": "2026-01-20, **Neutrino production mechanisms in strongly magnetized quark matter: Current status and open questions**, Igor A. Shovkovy et.al., [2601.14450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14450v1)\n\n We review the main neutrino emission mechanisms operating in dense quark matter under strong magnetic fields, with particular emphasis on conditions expected in the interiors of compact stars. We discuss the direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes in unpaired quark matter, incorporating the effects of Landau-level quantization. For the direct Urca process, the quantization of the electron energy spectrum plays a critical role, whereas quark quantization can often be neglected at sufficiently high baryon densities. The resulting field-dependent neutrino emissivity is anisotropic and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of magnetic-field strength. We explore the implications of these effects for magnetar cooling and for possible anisotropic neutrino emission that could contribute to pulsar kicks. In addition, we review the $\u03bd\\bar\u03bd$ synchrotron emission process, which, although subdominant, provides valuable insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and weak interactions in dense quark matter. Overall, our analysis highlights the nontrivial influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino production in magnetized quark cores, with potential consequences for the thermal and dynamical evolution of compact stars.\n\n", "2601.14394": "2026-01-20, **Gravitational Waves in an A4 Neutrino Mass Model**, Mu-Chun Chen et.al., [2601.14394v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14394v1)\n\n The A4 flavor symmetry has provided tremendous insight into the flavor structure of the lepton sector of the Standard Model, predicting a very good approximation to neutrino mixing angles, Tri-Bimaximal Mixing. A4 is spontaneously broken by a scalar called the flavon, and when this happens a number of degenerate vacua can form, resulting in so-called domain walls. These objects are not observed and hence need to be annihilated. This is usually done by explicitly breaking A4 by adding a bias term to the scalar potential. In this paper, we construct a new model invariant under A4 and Z4, which creates cosmologically viable domain walls, lifts the degeneracy of the vacuum giving a natural mechanism for domain walls to annihilate, as well as predicts realistic neutrino mixing angles; all utilizing cross couplings between flavons. The annihilation of the domain walls, with proper choice of wall tension and the consequent bias term, leads to a gravitational wave signal that is potentially detectable in near future gravitational wave experiments, and interestingly intersects with the observed Pulsar Timing Array signal.\n\n", "2601.14388": "2026-01-20, **Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra**, Wynn C.

Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.\n\n", "2601.14386": "2026-01-20, **Emergent Large Lepton Mixing from Neutrino Refraction in Dark Matter**, Susobhan Chattopadhyay et.al., [2601.14386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14386v1)\n\n We propose a novel origin for the disparity between quark and lepton flavor mixing based on the refractive nature of neutrino masses. We postulate that the fundamental mixing in both the quark and lepton sectors is CKM-like, together with tiny vacuum neutrino masses, while the observed PMNS mixing matrix emerges dynamically from coherent forward scattering of neutrinos on an ultralight dark matter background. The resulting in-medium Hamiltonian rotates CKM mixing angles into large effective lepton mixings, naturally realizing quark--lepton complementarity without invoking new flavor symmetries.

We show that, if the condition of charge quantization is relaxed, the anomaly-free $B-L$ charges of two out of three right-handed neutrinos can be enhanced by arbitrarily large factors, while all other fermions retain their canonical charges. We call this setup as `enhanced $B-L$ symmetry' and promote it to be local. As long as this enhanced $B-L$ gauge symmetry remains unbroken, neutrinos stay chiral and massless at low energies. Nonzero neutrino masses then require sub-eV-scale symmetry breaking order parameters, which we associate with gravity-induced neutrino condensate. If the enhancement is large and the $B-L$ gauge boson $A'$ is lighter than the heaviest neutrino, then the neutrino decay into $A'$ directly constrains the gauge coupling, which can be significantly stronger than the baryon-based fifth-force tests. Through kinetic mixing with the photon, $A'$ can also mediate neutrino-electron and coherent neutrino-nucleus scatterings, leading to possible signatures in neutrino observatories and dark matter detectors.\n\n", "2601.14102": "2026-01-20, **Measurement of the Z$\u03b3$ production cross section and search for anomalous neutral triple gauge couplings in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV**, CMS Collaboration et.al., [2601.14102v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14102v1)\n\n A measurement of the fiducial cross section of the associated production of a Z boson and a high-$p\\_\\mathrm{T}$ photon, where the Z decays to two neutrinos, and a search for anomalous triple gauge couplings are reported.

Kinetic mixing $\\varepsilon$ induces an effective coupling to the electromagnetic current, while $U$ interacts with stable dark matter (DM) $\u03c7$ via a dark gauge coupling $g\\_\u03c7$. Our analysis is based on the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, extended to include dark photon production and decay into dileptons ($U\\!\\to e^+e^-$).

Cosmological as well as idealised simulations reveal that the dark matter (DM) haloes interact with baryonic matter, primarily the stellar bars, dynamically by means of the exchange of angular momentum. In these simulations, the spherical DM halo dynamically responds to interaction with the stellar bar by reshaping its orbital structure in the proximity of the stellar bar, forming a bar-like configuration, called as the Dark Matter (DM) bar. Using N-body simulations of Milky Way analogs we discuss the role of inner halo angular momentum, measured as halo spin parameter \u03bb of the dark matter halo, on formation and evolutionary characteristics of the DM bars. Our systematic study involves haloes with initial spin configurations ranging from \u03bb = 0 to 0.1. The result conveys that DM bar formation and its characteristics are extensively dependent on the initial spin parameter \u03bb of the DM halo. We demonstrate that the strength of the dark matter bar gradually increases with an increase in halo spin in long-term evolution, with a significant impact of stellar bar buckling on dark matter bar strength.

One promising formation pathway is the direct collapse black hole (DCBH) scenario, in which gas in pristine, low-metallicity halos forms supermassive (or quasi-) stars leading to massive black holes seeds under specific environmental conditions. In this work, we investigate the potential host environments of DCBHs by coupling a semi-analytic model tracing BH formation and galaxy co-evolution with high-resolution N-body dark matter merger trees.

This approach provides a physically viable interpretation of these analytic solutions, which (in general) admit no isometries, thus allowing, in principle, for modeling time and space varying 3-dimensional fields of peculiar velocities that can be contrasted with observational data on our local cosmography.

This work develops a mass inversion method tailored for upcoming space missions such as CSST and Euclid, aiming to recover both the mass distribution and the convergence power spectrum with high fidelity. We introduce MIU2Net, a versatile deep-learning framework for kappa-map reconstruction based on the U2-Net architecture. A new loss function is constructed to jointly estimate the convergence field and its frequency-domain energy distribution, effectively balancing optimal mean squared error and optimal power-spectrum recovery. The method incorporates realistic observational effects into shear fields, including shape noise, reduced shear, and complex masks. Under noise levels anticipated for future space-based lensing surveys, MIU2Net recovers the convergence power spectrum with 4% uncertainties up to l approximately 500, significantly outperforming Wiener filtering and MCALens. Beyond two-point statistics, the method accurately reconstructs the convergence distribution, peak centroid, and peak amplitude. Compared to other learning-based approaches such as DeepMass, MIU2Net reduces the root-mean-square error by 5% without smoothing and by 38% with a 1-arcmin smoothing scale.

In a dense and pair-loaded wind environment, the emerging spectra exhibit a broad attenuation structure, whose morphology is sensitive to the low-energy spectral index $\u03b1$. In particular, spectra with $\u03b1> -1$ develop a pronounced, saddle-shaped absorption between 1 and 100 MeV (rest frame).

Quite puzzlingly, it is also the most energetic GRB known. Among the riddles posed by this mysterious source, however, the sheer energetics are hardly the most intriguing: an unprecedented, narrow, luminous emission line at around 10 MeV has been uncovered by a detailed spectral analysis of \\textit{Fermi}/GBM data immediately following the brightest peak in the GRB prompt emission and the peak of the TeV afterglow. As noted in the discovery article, the temporal evolution of the line properties can be explained as being due to high-latitude emission from a geometrically thin, relativistically expanding shell where annihilation of a large number of electron-positron pairs took place. We show that this interpretation yields stringent constraints on the properties of such shell, that point to a process that happens at radii typical of external shocks. We then demonstrate that the shell could have been the blastwave associated with the GRB precursor, with the line arising after pair loading of such blastwave as it was illuminated by the bright and hard radiation of the GRB main event. The scenario, which also explains the abrupt initial rise of the LHAASO afterglow, requires the progenitor of the GRB to have been surrounded by a circum-stellar medium (CSM) extending out to a few $10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, with a density $n\\_\\mathrm{ext}\\sim 10^{8}-10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ reminiscent of those found from studies of Type IIn supernovae.

We show that the underpinning evidence required for this conclusion -- the supernova progenitor-age dependence, the redshift-dependent age difference, and their combined impact -- is either negligible or relies on effects already corrected for in modern supernova analyses. First, the S25 analysis omits the standard host-galaxy stellar mass correction that captures known environmental dependencies that also correlate with stellar age. Applying this correction to the S25 sample, we find no dependence of standardized supernova brightness on host age. Independent data also show no significant difference at low-redshift in standardized brightness between star-forming galaxies and several Gyr older quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass.
