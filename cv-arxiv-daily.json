The Higgsino can naturally realize the ``inelastic dark matter\" scenario, where the scattering off a nucleus occurs between two nearly-degenerate states, making it invisible to WIMP direct detection experiments if the splitting is too large to be excited. It was realized that a ``luminous dark matter\" detection process, where the Higgsino upscatters in the Earth and subsequently decays into a photon in a large neutrino detector, offers the best sensitivity to such a scenario. We consider the possibility of adding a large volume of a heavy element, such as Pb or U, around the detector. We also consider the presence of U and Th in the Earth itself, and the effect of an enhanced high-velocity tail of the dark matter distribution due to the presence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. These effects can significantly improve the sensitivity of detectors such as JUNO, SNO+, and Borexino, potentially making it possible in the future to cover much of the remaining parameter space for this classic SUSY WIMP dark matter.\n\n", "2409.07634": "2024-09-11, **ARA-Next: a new DAQ and trigger architecture for the Askaryan Radio Array**, Pawan Giri et.al., [2409.07634v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07634v1)\n\n The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment aims to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos (>10 PeV) using radio detection techniques.

Upcoming CMB spectrum measurements, such as those underway at the Simons Observatory, will achieve unprecedented precision, allowing for more accurate extraction of information about the properties of the primordial plasma and, in particular, primordial neutrinos. This provides an opportunity to test whether these properties align with the predictions of the standard cosmological model or indicate the presence of new physics that influenced the evolution of the MeV-temperature plasma. A key component in understanding how new physics may have affected primordial neutrinos is solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving this equation that offers model independence, transparency, and computational efficiency - features that current state-of-the-art methods lack.

In particular, neither the uncertainty in the energy resolution nor a systematic error in the energy response of a detector will lead to a correlation between bins. This is in contrast with a result that recently appeared in the literature, where it was claimed that the finite energy resolution could induce correlation between bins, changing the distribution of $\\Delta\\chi^2$ when attempting to determine the neutrino mass ordering using reactor neutrinos. We will compute the expression for the variance of $\\Delta\\chi^2$ in the case of non-nested hypotheses if correlations between bins are present, showing that they could indeed affect the distribution. We will also show, however, that the detector response cannot introduce statistical correlations between bins unless these are already present in the original spectrum.

For this cluster, we combine X-ray data from SRG/eROSITA and Chandra, optical images from DESI, and spectroscopy from BTA and RTT-150 telescopes.

The line-of-sight velocity of galaxies tentatively associated with the two merging halos differs by 2000-3000 km/s. We conclude that, most plausibly, the merger axis is neither close to the line of sight nor to the sky plane.

We find that the selection based on stellar dynamics is able to reproduce the expected stellar population trends of different morphologies, with higher star-formation rates and younger stars in disc-dominated galaxies. Halo spin seems to play no role in the morphology of the galaxies. At fixed $M\\_*$, our mostly-disc and intermediate samples form in dark matter haloes that are $2$-$10$ times less massive than the spheroidal sample, highlighting a higher efficiency in disc galaxies to retain and condensate their baryons. On average, mergers are less prevalent in the build up of discs than in spheroidal galaxies, but there is a large scatter, including the existence of mostly-disc galaxies with $15\\%$-$30\\%$ of their stars from accreted origin.

While this approximation may be sufficient for previous data sets, the stringent cosmic shear calibration requirements and the high quality of the data in the upcoming Euclid survey demand a consideration of the effects that realistic galaxy substructures have on shear measurement biases. Here we present a novel deep learning-based method to create such simulated galaxies directly from HST data. We first build and validate a convolutional neural network based on the wavelet scattering transform to learn noise-free representations independent of the point-spread function of HST galaxy images that can be injected into simulations of images from Euclid's optical instrument VIS without introducing noise correlations during PSF convolution or shearing. Then, we demonstrate the generation of new galaxy images by sampling from the model randomly and conditionally. Next, we quantify the cosmic shear bias from complex galaxy shapes in Euclid-like simulations by comparing the shear measurement biases between a sample of model objects and their best-fit double-S\\'ersic counterparts. Using the KSB shape measurement algorithm, we find a multiplicative bias difference between these branches with realistic morphologies and parametric profiles on the order of $6.9\\times 10^{-3}$ for a realistic magnitude-S\\'ersic index distribution.

The dark matter equations of state are based on observational data from the rotational curves of galaxies and the fermionic self-interacting dark matter. Our results verify that the spontaneous scalarization is affected by the dark matter pressure in neutron stars. Depending on the central density of scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars, the dark matter pressure alters the central scalar field. The increase of dark matter pressure in low-density scalarized stars amplifies the central scalar field. However, the pressure of dark matter in high-density scalarized stars suppresses the central scalar field.

The cluster structure is quite complex with an elongated core region containing the two brightest cluster galaxies and one dense group to the south-east. Since there is no velocity difference between the core and the south-east group, we suggest the presence of a merger along the plane of the sky.

However, contemporaneous observations in radio and X-ray are critical for reducing the afterglow parameter space and for more efficient parameter estimation. We compare different methods for fitting joint kilonova and afterglow observations under different scenarios. We find that ignoring the contribution of one source (even in scenarios where the source is sub-dominant) can lead to significantly biased estimated parameters but could still produce great light curve fits that do not raise suspicion. This bias is also present for analyses that fit data where one source is \"subtracted\". In most scenarios, the bias is smaller than the systematic uncertainty inherent to kilonova models but significant for afterglow parameters, particularly in the absence of high-quality radio and X-ray observations. Instead, we show that the most reliable method for inference in any scenario where contamination can not be confidently dismissed is to jointly fit for both an afterglow and kilonova/supernova, and showcase a Bayesian framework to make this joint analysis computationally feasible.\n\n", "2409.07124": "2024-09-11, **Galactic Distribution of Supernovae and OB Associations**, M. Kachelriess et.al., [2409.07124v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07124v1)\n\n We update and extend a previous model by Higdon and Lingenfelter for the longitudinal profile of the N\\,II intensity in the Galactic plane. The model is based on four logarithmic spiral arms, to which features like the Local Arm and local sources are added. Connecting then the N\\,II to the H\\,II emission, we use this model to determine the average spatial distribution of OBassociations in the Milky Way. Combined with a stellar mass and cluster distribution function, the model predicts the average spatial and temporal distribution of core-collapse supernovae in the Milky Way. In addition to this average population, we account for supernovae from observed OB associations, providing thereby a more accurate description of the nearby Galaxy. The complete model is made publicly available in the python code SNOB.\n\n", "2409.07038": "2024-09-11, **Investigations on the equation of state of neutron star matter with density-dependent relativistic mean-field model**, Kaixuan Huang et.al., [2409.07038v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07038v1)\n\n The compact object with a mass of $2.50-2.67~M\\_\\odot$ observed by LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations in GW190814, as well as the recent report of a light compact object with a mass and radius of $M=0.77^{+0.20}\\_{-0.17}M\\_{\\odot}$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}\\_{-0.78}$ km within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, have posed a great challenge to the investigations into the supranuclear matter. In the inner core region of the neutron star, the strangeness degrees of freedom, such as the hyperons, can be present, which is also named as a hyperonic star. In this work, the neutron star consisting of nucleons and leptons, and the hyperonic star including the hyperons will be studied in the framework of the density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) model. Some popular DDRMF parameterizations will be adopted to investigate the properties of nuclear matter and the mass, radius, tidal deformability, and other properties of neutron star and hyperonic stars. We find that the maximum masses of neutron star calculated by DD-MEX, DD-MEX1, DD-MEX2, DD-MEXY and DD-LZ1 sets can be around $2.5-2.6~M\\_\\odot$ with quite stiff equations of state (EOSs) generated by their strong repulsive contributions from vector potentials at high densities. Moreover, by investigating the influence of the crust EOS and core EOS on the neutron stars, we find that the observational data from HESS J1731-347 suggest the requirement of a crust EOS with a higher $L$ parameter and a core EOS with a lower $L$ parameter, and the $M-R$ relations from the constructed EOSs can also be consistent with the observables of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451 from NICER and the GW170817 event. With the inclusion of hyperons, the hyperonic star matter becomes softer compared to the neutron star matter. But the massive hyperonic star can also be obtained with DDRMF parameter sets if the vector coupling constants are strong.\n\n"}}
