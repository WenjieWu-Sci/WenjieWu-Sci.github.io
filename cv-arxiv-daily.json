The most common alternative approach applied in particle physics is a highly computationally expensive procedure put forward by Feldman and Cousins. When many experiments are combined for a global fit to data, deviations from Wilks' theorem are exacerbated, and Feldman-Cousins becomes computationally intractable. We present a novel, machine learning-based procedure that can approximate a full-fledged Bayesian analysis 200 times faster than the Feldman-Cousins method. We demonstrate the utility of this novel method by performing a joint analysis of electron neutrino/antineutrino disappearance data within a single sterile neutrino oscillation framework. Although we present a prototypical simulation-based inference method for a sterile neutrino global fit, we anticipate that similar procedures will be useful for global fits of all kinds, especially those in which Feldman-Cousins is too computationally expensive to use.\n\n", "2501.08984": "2025-01-15, **Centre-of-momentum Variables in $\u03bd_\u03bc$CC1p1$\u03c0$**, Weijun Li et.al., [2501.08984v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08984v1)\n\n This study introduces a novel set of variables designed to isolate final-state interactions from the effects of nuclear initial states.

It is usually believed that the spin-down energy injected from the pulsars is converted into magnetic field and relativistic electrons, but the possible presence of proton acceleration inside PWNe cannot be ruled out. Previous works have estimated the neutrino emission from PWNe using various source catalogs measured in gamma-rays. However, such results rely on the sensitivity of TeV gamma-ray observations and may omit the contribution by unresolved sources. Here we estimate the potential neutrino emission from a synthetic population of PWNe in the Galaxy with a focus on the ones that are still in the free expansion phase. In the calculation, we model the temporal evolution of the free-expanding PWNe and consider the transport of protons inside the PWNe. The Crab nebula is treated as a standard template for young PWNe to evaluate some model parameters, such as the energy conversion fraction of relativistic protons and the target gas density for the hadronic process, which are relevant to neutrino production. In the optimistic case, the neutrino flux from the simulated young PWNe may constitute to 5% of the measured flux by IceCube around 100 TeV. At higher energy around 1 PeV, the neutrino emission from the population highly depends on the injection spectral shape, and also on the emission of the nearby prominent sources.\n\n", "2501.08876": "2025-01-15, **Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background**, Andrew D.

It is sensitive to the universe's stellar formation history, the fraction of CCSNe forming black holes, and cosmological expansion. To this date, it has yet to be detected. The most sensitive experimental search is from the Super-Kamiokande experiment, and the next few years will see other sensitive experiments like Hyper-Kamiokande and the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory come online.

With this in mind, we have undertaken a refined analysis of the observations, taking into account the knowledge gained over the past decades.

The largest uncertainties in estimating neutrino-nucleus interaction cross sections arise from the incomplete understanding of nuclear effects. In the study of neutrino oscillations and nuclear scattering processes, obtaining an interaction model with associated uncertainties is of substantial interest for the neutrino physics community. This report presents studies of simulated CC 2p-2h interactions, in which a neutrino interacts with a bound pair of nucleons. This interaction mode is very poorly constrained by current data.

Three right-handed neutrinos $N\\_{1,2,3R}$ transform under $Z\\_3$ as $1,w,w^2$, where $w=e^{i2\\pi/3}$ is the cube root of unity, and they couple to usual lepton doublets via the usual Higgs doublet $H$ and two new scalar doublets $\\eta,\\chi$, which transform under $Z\\_3$ as $1,w^2,w$, respectively. This leads to a scotoseesaw mechanism in which the seesaw and scotogenic neutrino mass generations are induced by the Majorana $N\\_{1R}$ mass and the Dirac $N\\_{2,3R}$ mass, respectively. Although the lightest of the $Z\\_3$ fields is stabilized, responsible for dark matter, the model lacks an explanation for relic density and/or direct detection.

When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $\\|0\\rangle$ and $\\|1\\rangle$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.\n\n", "2501.08622": "2025-01-15, **Prospects of $Z'$ Portal Dark Matter in $U(1)_{L_\u03bc-L_\u03c4}$**, Zhen-Wei Wang et.al., [2501.08622v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08622v1)\n\n The gauged $U(1)\\_{L\\_\\mu-L\\_\\tau}$ model is well-motivated to explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly and dark matter in previous studies.

We show that deep learning and simulation-based inference (SBI) methods produce informative and reliable estimates of parameter posteriors for strong lensing systems in ground-based surveys. We present the examination and comparison of two approaches to lens parameter estimation for strong galaxy-galaxy lenses -- Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). We perform inference on 1-, 5-, and 12-parameter lens models for ground-based imaging data that mimics the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We find that NPE outperforms BNNs, producing posterior distributions that are more accurate, precise, and well-calibrated for most parameters. For the 12-parameter NPE model, the calibration is consistently within $<$10\\% of optimal calibration for all parameters, while the BNN is rarely within 20\\% of optimal calibration for any of the parameters. Similarly, residuals for most of the parameters are smaller (by up to an order of magnitude) with the NPE model than the BNN model.

This high-redshift Type II SN sample allows us to compare low-redshift Type II SNe to their high-redshift counterparts. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts.
