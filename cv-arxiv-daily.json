In the last decades, Galactic black holes in X-ray binaries (BHXBs) have been proposed as candidate sources of CRs revising the CR paradigm. BHXBs launch two relativistic jets during outbursts, but recent observations suggest that such jets may be launched even during quiescence. A0620-00 is such a well-studied object that shows hints of jet emission. In this work, we study the simultaneous radio-to-X-ray spectrum detected from this source while in quiescence to better constrain the jet dynamics. Given that the majority of BHXBs spend their lifetime in quiescence (qBHXBs), we use the jet dynamics of A0620-00 to study a population of 100000 such sources distributed throughout the Galactic disc, and a further 10000 located in the Boxy Bulge around the Galactic centre. While the contribution to the CR spectrum is suppressed, we find that the cumulative intrinsic emission of qBHXBs from both the Boxy Bulge and the Galactic disc adds to the diffuse emission that various facilities detect from radio to TeV gamma rays. We examine the contribution of qBHXBs to the Galactic diffuse emission and investigate the possibility of SKA, INTEGRAL and CTAO to detect individual sources in the future. Finally, we compare the predicted neutrino flux to the recently presented Galactic diffuse neutrino emission by IceCube.\n\n", "2406.11956": "2024-06-17, **Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity: unifying the strong CP and hierarchy puzzles**, Georgios K.

The smallness of this particle's mass as well as of the cosmological constant is ensured by tiny values of the gauge coupling constants of the local Lorentz group. The tree value of the Higgs boson mass and that of Majorana leptons (if added to the Standard Model to solve the neutrino mass, baryogenesis and dark matter problems) are very small or vanishing, opening the possibility of their computability in terms of the fundamental parameters of the theory due to nonperturbative effects.\n\n", "2406.11438": "2024-06-17, **Search for Majorana Neutrinos with the Complete KamLAND-Zen Dataset**, S.

However, in most studies, radiation is often disregarded as a minor factor in dynamical system analyses, overlooking whether radiation domination is achievable. In this paper, we rigorously examine this critical aspect for common parameterizations of bulk viscosity, denoted as $\\xi$, within two general classes of viscous unified models. Our findings reveal significant inconsistencies in models where $\\xi \\propto H^{1-2s} \\rho\\_{m}^{s}$ with $s\\leq 0$, and surprisingly, in models where $\\xi \\propto \\rho\\_{m}^{s}$ with exponents $s<0$, as they both fail to produce a radiation-dominated era. Moreover, the exponent $s$ must lye within the interval $0 \\leq s < 1/2$ for the latter model to correctly describes the cosmological evolution.

We find that such DM is generally heavy and has a large initial velocity, leading to the possibility of DM being warm today. We differentiate between the cases of weakly and strongly coupled dark sectors, where, in the latter case, we focus on glueball DM, which turns out to have very distinct phenomenological properties.

The orientations of the disks are also varied. In particular, we investigate how magnetic field amplification depends on the these parameters. We use magnetohydrodynamics for gas disks in combination with live dark matter halos in adaptive mesh refinement simulations. The disks are initialized using a setup for isolated disks in hydrostatic equilibrium. Small-scale filtering of the velocity and magnetic field allows us to estimate the turbulent electromotive force (EMF) and kinetic helicity. Time series of the average magnetic field in central and outer disk regions show pronounced peaks during close encounters and mergers. This agrees with observed magnetic fields at different interaction stages. The central field strength exceeds 10 microgauss (corresponding to an amplification factor of 2 to 3) for small impact parameters. As the disks are increasingly disrupted and turbulence is produced by tidal forces, the small-scale EMF reaches a significant fraction of the total EMF. The small-scale kinetic helicity is initially antisymmetric across the disk plane. Albeit its evolution is sensitive to both the impact parameter and inclinations of the rotation axes with respect to the relative motion of the disks, antisymmetry is generally broken through interactions and the merger remnant has lost most of the initial helicity. The EMF and the magnetic field also decay rapidly after coalescence. The strong amplification during close encounters of the interacting galaxies are mostly driven by helical flows and a mean-field dynamo. The small-scale dynamo contributes significantly in post-interaction phases. However, the amplification of the magnetic field cannot be sustained.\n\n", "2406.12518": "2024-06-18, **Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ Extended Inert Doublet Model: A First-Order Phase Transition Perspective**, Indra Kumar Banerjee et.al., [2406.12518v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12518v1)\n\n We conduct an analysis of a $U(1)\\_{B-L}$ extended inert doublet model and obtained the parameter space allowing strong first order phase transitions.

Originating from the axion field, they offer a possible resolution of the similarity between visible and dark components of the Universe. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and resulting in pervasive electromagnetic radiation throughout the Universe. This work aims to predict the electromagnetic signature in large-scale structures from the AQN-baryon interaction, accounting for thermal and non-thermal radiations. We use Magneticum hydrodynamical simulations to describe the distribution and dynamics of gas and dark matter at cosmological scales. We calculate the electromagnetic signature from radio, starting at $\\nu \\sim$ 1 GHz, up to a few keV X-ray energies. We find that the AQNs signature is characterized by monopole and fluctuation signals. The amplitude of both signals strongly depends on the average AQN mass and the ionization level of the baryonic environment. We identify a most optimistic scenario with a signal often near the sensitivity limit of existing instruments, such as FIRAS and the South Pole Telescope for high-resolution. Fluctuations in the Extra-galactic Background Light caused by the AQN can be tested with space-based imagers Euclid and James Webb Space Telescope. We also identify a minimal configuration, still out of reach of existing instruments, but future experiments might be able to pose constraints on the AQN model. We conclude that this is a viable dark matter model, which does not violate the canons of cosmology, nor existing observations. The best chances for testing this model reside in 1) ultra-deep IR and optical surveys, 2) spectral distorsions of the CMB and 3) low-frequency (1 GHz < $\\nu $ < 100 GHz) and high-resolution ($\\ell > 10^4$) observations.\n\n", "2406.12106": "2024-06-17, **Challenges to the Lambda CDM Cosmology**, George Efstathiou et.al., [2406.12106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12106v1)\n\n Observations of the cosmic microwave backgroundradiation are described to remarkable accuracy by the six-parameterLambda CDM cosmology.

Gravitational interactions between dark matter substructures and streams lead to the formation of low density \"gaps\" in streams, with any given stream typically containing no more than a few such gaps. Prior models for the statistics of such gaps have relied on several simplifying assumptions for the properties of the subhalo population in the cold dark matter scenario. With the expected forthcoming increase in the number of streams, and gaps, observed, in this work we develop a more detailed model for the statistics of subhalos interacting with streams, and test some of the assumptions made in prior works. Instead of using simple fits to N-body estimates of subhalo population statistics at z = 0 as in previous work, we make use of realizations of time-dependent subhalo populations generated from a fully physical model, incorporating structure formation, and subhalo orbital evolution, including tidal heating and stripping physics, which has been carefully calibrated to match results of cosmological N-body simulations.

Common URC formulations fail to achieve an adequate level of accuracy to qualify as truly universal over fully sampled RCs. We develop neural network (NN) equivalents for the proposed URCs which predict RCs with higher accuracy, showing that URC inaccuracies are not due to insufficient data but rather non-optimal formulations or sampling effects. This conclusion remains even if the total RC sample is pruned for symmetry. The latest URC prescriptions and their NN equivalents trained on our sub-sample of 579 disk galaxies with symmetric RCs perform similarly to the URC/NN trained on the complete data sample.

For\u00e9s-Toribio et.al., [2406.11609v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11609v1)\n\n We propose and discuss a new experimental approach to measure the centroid shift induced by gravitational microlensing in the images of lensed quasars (astrometric microlensing). Our strategy is based on taking the photocenter of a region in the quasar large enough as to be insensitive to microlensing as reference to measure the centroid displacement of the continuum. In this way, single-epoch measurements of astrometric microlensing can be performed. Using numerical simulations, we show that, indeed, the centroid shift monotonically decreases as the size of the emitting region increases, and only for relatively large regions, like the broad line region (BLR), does the centroid shift become negligible. This opens interesting possibilities to study the stratification of the different emitters in the accretion disk and the BLR. We estimate the amplitude of the centroid shifts for 79 gravitationally lensed images and study more thoroughly the special cases Q2237+030 A, RXJ1131-1231 A, PG1115+080 A2 and SDSS J1004+4112 A. We propose to use spectro-astrometry to simultaneously obtain the photocenters of the continuum and of different emission line regions since, with the precision of forthcoming instruments, astrometric microlensing by $\\sim 1 M\\_\\odot$ mass microlenses may be detected in many quasar lensed images. When we consider more massive micro/millilenses, $M\\gtrsim 10 M\\_\\odot$, often proposed as the constituents of dark matter, the BLR becomes sensitive to microlensing and can no longer be used as a positional reference to measure centroid shifts.

However, the formation mechanism of massive and compact gas clumps that precede YMCs remains unknown. In this paper, we study the formation of such massive clumps via fast HI gas collisions (~100 km/s) as suggested by recent observations and their subsequent evolution into YMCs by using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations involving self-gravity and detailed thermal/chemical processes. In particular, the impact of ionization feedback from stellar radiation is included in an approximate fashion where the temperature within the HII regions is elevated to 10,000 K, while supernova feedback is not included. We examine whether the resulting massive clumps can survive this ionization feedback and evolve into YMCs. Our simulations reveal the emergence of gas clumps that do not only possess substantial mass (~10^5 M\\_sun) but also sufficient compactness (~5 pc). Notably, these clumps exhibit significantly higher escape velocities compared to the sound speed of the HII region, indicating effective gravitational retention of gas against feedback-induced evaporation. Consequently, these conditions foster efficient star formation within the massive gas clumps, ultimately leading to their evolution into YMCs.

However, these effects are limited in dense regions with hydrogen columns $N\\_\\mathrm{H} > 3 \\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, where the H$\\alpha$- and YSO-based SFR maps show better agreement. Based on this finding we propose a calibration model that can precisely measure the SFR of large molecular clouds (mean radius > 100 pc) with a combination of H$\\alpha$ and CO observations, which provides a foundation for future study of star formation processes in extragalactic molecular clouds.\n\n", "2406.11111": "2024-06-17, **No evidence for a dip in the binary black hole mass spectrum**, Christian Adamcewicz et.al., [2406.11111v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11111v1)\n\n Stellar models indicate that the core compactness of a star, which is a common proxy for its explodability in a supernova, does not increase monotonically with the star's mass. Rather, the core compactness dips sharply over a range of carbon-oxygen core masses; this range may be somewhat sensitive to the star's metallicity and evolutionary history. Stars in this compactness dip are expected to experience supernovae leaving behind neutron stars, whereas stars on either side of this range are expected to form black holes. This results in a hypothetical mass range in which black holes should seldom form. Quantitatively, when applied to binary stripped stars, these models predict a dearth of binary black holes with component masses $\\approx 10 M\\_\\odot - 15 M\\_\\odot$. The population of gravitational-wave signals indicates weak evidence for a dip in the distribution of chirp masses of merging binary black holes near $\\approx 10 M\\_\\odot - 12 M\\_\\odot$. This feature could be linked to the hypothetical component mass gap described above, but this interpretation depends on what assumptions are made of the binaries' mass ratios. Here, we directly probe the distribution of binary black hole component masses to look for evidence of a gap. We find no evidence for this feature using data from the third gravitational-wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3). If this gap does exist in nature, we find that it is unlikely to be resolvable by the end of the current (fourth) LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing run.\n\n"}}
