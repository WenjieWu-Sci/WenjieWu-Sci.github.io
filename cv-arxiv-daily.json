We identify a new regime of \\emph{hybrid resonant leptogenesis} in renormalizable SO(10) grand unified theories, where a quasi-degeneracy between the scalar triplet and the heaviest right-handed neutrino, \\( M\\_T \\simeq M\\_{N\\_3}, \\) induces an unavoidable interference between type-I and type-II decay amplitudes. This interference gives rise to a physical CP-violating phase, \\( \u03c6\\_{\\rm HR} = \\arg(\u03bcf Y\\_\u03bd^\\dagger), \\) which cannot be removed by field redefinitions and leads to a resonant enhancement of the baryon asymmetry without extreme Yukawa hierarchies or tuning.

In contrast to purely leptonic models, this work investigates whether hadronic mechanisms can explain the observed gamma-ray spectra by analyzing the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a chosen sample of FSRQs (Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars). By incorporating both hadronic and leptonic components into their multi-wavelength modeling, we evaluate the model's feasibility to simultaneously describe the data collected by Fermi-LAT and neutrinos detected by IceCube.

In this study, we propose a plastic scintillator detector which demonstrates the ability to clearly distinguish fast neutrons, thermal neutrons, and gamma rays within mixed radiation fields, offering a practical approach for multi-radiation detection. Two plastic scintillator assemblies: EJ200+EJ426 and EJ276+EJ426 were setup, and the system energy response was calibrated using three gamma sources(137Cs, 22Na and 60Co). An Am-Be neutron source was employed, and pulse shape discrimination(PSD) was used to separate fast neutrons, thermal neutrons and gamma rays. Using a three-sigma discrimination criterion, the EJ200+EJ426 configuration was found to reliably distinguish thermal neutrons from gamma rays, while the EJ276+EJ426 configuration can effectively discriminate fast neutrons, thermal neutrons and gamma rays at gamma-equivalent energies above 1 MeV.\n\n", "2512.15294": "2025-12-17, **Beyond Stage IV: Quasar and Galaxy Clustering and the Fundamental Physics of the 2040s**, M.

We present a science case for next-generation wide-field spectroscopic surveys targeting $1 < z < 6$ with simultaneous observations of thousands of galaxies, quasars, and emission-line galaxies. Such surveys would deliver transformative advances: (i) cosmological constraints on absolute neutrino masses ($\u03a3m\\_\u03bd\\lesssim 0.015\\,\\mathrm{eV}$), three times more stringent than Stage IV, enabling resolution of the neutrino mass hierarchy; (ii) detection of primordial non-Gaussianity at the level of $f\\_{\\mathrm{NL}} \\sim 1$, probing multi-field inflation; (iii) measurements of structure growth $f\u03c3\\_8(z)$ spanning cosmic time to constrain dark energy and test gravitational modifications.

TAO can measure the reactor antineutrino energy spectrum with excellent energy resolution (better than 2\\% at 1 MeV) using state-of-the-art Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) operated at low temperature. To achieve this goal, the SiPMs (together with their readout electronics) must be well calibrated. This paper presents the channel-level calibration methods for the dark count rate (DCR), relative photon detection efficiency (PDE), time offset, gain, and internal optical crosstalk (IOCT) of the SiPMs based on charge and time information of the collected events. For the calibration of the external optical crosstalk (EOCT), in terms of its rate and emission angle distribution, a novel method is proposed by switching on and off different groups of SiPMs with an LED placed in the detector. Using one million simulated events, the expected calibration biases are evaluated for all the aforementioned parameters: relative PDE (2.1\\%), IOCT (1.4\\%), DCR (0.4\\%), EOCT Rate ($<0.1\\%$), gain ($<0.1\\%$), time offset (0.027 ns).

Guided by analytic scalings and 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar \"Fundamental Plane\" (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radiation-reaction-limited branch and a potential-drop-limited branch. Their intersection defines a transition in $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$ that maps to a gamma-ray visibility threshold on the $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram, above which detectability is set by distance and beaming, and below which both cutoff energy and efficiency decline rapidly. Placing ATNF pulsars and McGill magnetars onto these planes reproduces the observed Fermi occupancy, with millisecond pulsars (MSPs) on the observable side, young pulsars (YPs) straddling the threshold, and magnetars clustering at or just below it. At higher $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$, both MSPs and YPs depart from the maximal radiation-reaction-limited envelope at similar cutoff energies, suggesting that enhanced pair creation screens the accelerating electric field in the ECS. We interpret this behavior with a compactness-based criterion for optically thin $\u03b3\u03b3$ pair feedback in or near the ECS and briefly note an extension to $\u03b3\u03b3\\rightarrow\u03bc^\\pm$ that could yield pulsed multi-TeV neutrinos in the most energetic systems. The framework predicts an MeV-bright, GeV-faint corridor below current Fermi sensitivity, a target for next-generation MeV missions.

Accurate calibration of the receiver response, sampling the full range of possible neutrino geometries, is necessary to estimate the energy and incoming direction of the incident neutrino. Herein, we detail the design and performance of a custom radio-frequency calibration transmitter, consisting of a battery-powered, kiloVolt-scale signal generator (`IDL' pulser) driving an antenna (South Pole UNiversity of Kansas antenna, or `SPUNK') capable of operating at pressures of 200 atmospheres.

Nevertheless, many constructions leave certain global $U(1)$ redundancies ungauged. In this work, we take the gauge principle to its logical extreme by promoting all $SU(N)$ symmetries to $U(N)$. We focus on a model based on local $U(3)\\times U(2)$ invariance. This framework accounts for several otherwise ad hoc features of the Standard Model, including charge quantization and the observed hypercharge assignments, which emerge here as unique predictions. Furthermore, the internal consistency of the model requires the introduction of right-handed neutrinos and implies the presence of an additional $U(1)$ factor that can be identified with $B-L$, thereby naturally yielding non-zero neutrino masses. In light of these findings, we hypothesize that $U(3)\\times U(2)$ constitutes the underlying symmetry of the strong and electroweak interactions. More importantly, our approach opens up novel avenues for model building, driven by this extended interpretation of the gauge principle.\n\n", "2512.14824": "2025-12-16, **Towards First Detection of the Solar MSW Transition With JUNO**, Obada Nairat et.al., [2512.14824v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14824v1)\n\n Matter-induced neutrino flavor mixing (the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein, or MSW, effect) is a central prediction of the neutrino mixing framework, but it has not been conclusively observed. Direct observation of the energy-dependent MSW transition in the solar electron-neutrino survival probability would solve this, but backgrounds have been prohibitive.

At the same time, the peculiar structure of flavor can serve as a guiding principle for exploring possible new-physics effects. In this work, we present a systematic classification of dimension-six baryon-number-violating (BNV) SMEFT operators across several flavor-symmetry assumptions and analyze the resulting phenomenology. Interestingly, in certain flavor scenarios the non-trivial interplay with tiny neutrino masses leads to proton-decay constraints compatible with BNV scales in the multi-TeV range.

The evolution and decay of these strings source a stochastic gravitational-wave background that may be probed by current and future gravitational-wave experiments, while the decays of the resulting massive right-handed neutrinos can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis.

This work examines constraints on the nucleon axial form factor that can be achieved from datasets of neutrino scattering on deuterium targets, Lattice QCD predictions, and from the recent hydrogen target data from the MINERvA Collaboration.

We find a median ULDM particle mass of $7. \\times 10^{-22}$ eV and show that scaling relations suggest that the drag remains effective at relatively low ULDM fractions, which are consistent with all other constraints on the model.

In this work we show that non-thermal mechanisms can naturally overcome this obstacle. Using late-decaying reheatons as a representative case (while noting the broader applicability), we demonstrate that the final abundance is determined by two quantities: the branching fraction into strange-quark-rich matter and the coalescence probability into sexaquarks during the matter-dominated or early radiation-dominated epoch. We provide compact expressions and benchmark calculations for reheating temperatures $T\\_R \\in [10, 100]~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and reheaton masses above the QCD confinement scale.

As the number of extra dimensions increases, the effective equation of state for non-relativistic matter softens, making even modest DM accumulation inside neutron stars susceptible to gravitational collapse into extra-dimensional black holes. These black holes are longer lived than their $3$ dimensional counterparts and can accrete enough material to consume an entire neutron star, ultimately producing solar-mass black holes. For geometric cross sections, DM with masses above $\\mathcal{O}(10\\,{\\rm TeV})$ may already be excluded for more than two extra dimensions of size ${\\mathcal{O}(\\rm fm})$ -- sharply contrasting with the standard $3$ dimensional case, where comparable limits only appear for masses $\\gtrsim 10^{5}$ TeV at typical halo densities of $0.3\\, \\rm{GeV/cm^3}$.\n\n", "2512.14828": "2025-12-16, **Opening the Parameter Space of sub-GeV Inelastic Dark Matter through Parity Violation**, Giovani Dalla Valle Garcia et.al., [2512.14828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14828v1)\n\n Sub-GeV dark matter (DM) has emerged as a particularly compelling target in light of the persistent null results from conventional DM searches. While s-wave annihilating DM candidates with masses below the GeV are strongly constrained by indirect-detection bounds, inelastic scenarios can naturally evade these limits. In this work, we show that parity violation can play an important role in inelastic DM models featuring long-lived excited states by inducing small diagonal couplings that significantly relax experimental constraints. A precise determination of the excited-state abundance is essential for assessing the phenomenology of such models. To this end, we solve the integrated Boltzmann equation, fully accounting for up- and down-scattering with electrons and positrons as well as dark-sector conversion processes. Using the resulting abundance, we update the viable parameter space in light of the most recent experimental constraints and demonstrate that parity-violating interactions can reopen broad regions of parameter space that would otherwise be excluded. Moreover, the forthcoming LDMX experiment will probe a significant portion of the parameter space.

Connecting the distribution of baryonic matter and energy across these scales will remain one of the key challenges for both theoretical and observational astrophysics in the coming decade.

To combine the two regimes, we need a paradigm shift in the way we do spectroscopy on galaxies, especially considering the ongoing and future photometric surveys. The next decade will also bring a revolution in extensive photometric surveys of large areas of the sky, uncovering low surface brightness features around nearby galaxies.

In many such theories the force is screened; suppressed in dense environments but potentially active in galaxies used for distance calibration. We model this environmental dependence using three quantities that characterize each galaxy's large-scale gravitational environment: the external gravitational potential $\u03a6$, acceleration $a$, and curvature $K$. Our baseline analysis recalibrates the SH0ES-team's Cepheid-supernova distance ladder, incorporating the fifth force via its impact on the Cepheid period-luminosity relation. Across models, a fifth force is strongly constrained, with posteriors concentrated around a null result. The inferred Hubble constant is $H\\_0 = 73.1 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, retaining the Hubble tension at $>5 \\, \u03c3$.

This focuses classifier attention on the relevant pixels, and enables arbitrary rotations for class upsampling. We also fit observed multi-band light curves with a two-dimensional Gaussian Process and generate data-driven synthetic samples by resampling and redshifting these models, cross-matching with galaxy images in the same class to produce unique but realistic new examples for training.

Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological distance scales and led to the discovery of dark energy and the award of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries. Nonetheless, the intrinsic faintness of the majority of these systems will prevent their spectroscopic characterisation with the instruments available in the 2030s. Hence ESO's Expanding Horizons call is timely for planning a future transformative facility, capable of delivering phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of faint white dwarf binaries, which are key to advancing our understanding of stellar and Galactic evolution and cosmology.\n\n", "2512.14143": "2025-12-16, **The role of supernova remnants for the emergence of pre-biotic chemistry in molecular clouds**, Giuliana Cosentino et.al., [2512.14143v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14143v1)\n\n There is growing evidence that the Sun might have formed within a nebula impacted by at least one SNR. In this scenario, ejecta and shocks from SNRs may have provided the elements on which life as we know it is based. Investigating the chemical complexity of molecular clouds impacted by SNRs is therefore essential to unveil the star formation process and how life appeared on Earth. In this paper, we exploit this scientific questions and describe which technical specifications will drive in future generation telescopes.\n\n"}}
