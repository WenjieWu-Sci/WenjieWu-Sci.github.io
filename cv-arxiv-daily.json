The model is based on an extended $U(1)\\_X$ Froggatt-Nielsen--like mechanism, which naturally generates suppressed Yukawa couplings and realizes a Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses. An additional $\\mathbb{Z}\\_4$ symmetry stabilizes the dark sector, where chiral fermions charged under $\\mathbb{Z}\\_4$ serve as ADM candidates. Leptogenesis occurs through the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Dirac neutrinos, where the generated asymmetry is shared between the visible and dark sectors due to exact lepton-number conservation. The same suppression mechanism that explains the smallness of neutrino masses also determines the GeV-scale ADM mass. Numerical studies demonstrate that a fully asymmetric DM scenario is realized, consistent with relic abundance, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and direct detection constraints. This framework provides an experimentally testable connection between neutrino physics, dark matter, and baryogenesis within an anomaly-free setup.\n\n", "2510.13574": "2025-10-15, **Hyperons and $\u0394$'s in rotating protoneutron stars: Local properties**, Franciele M. da Silva et.al., [2510.13574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13574v1)\n\n The structural evolution of rotating protoneutron stars encodes essential information about their observable signatures, while microscopic properties provide complementary knowledge to advance observational investigations. Using a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings that account for temperature and particle composition, we investigate rotation, neutrino-emission-driven changes in angular momentum, particle distributions, temperature profiles, and sound speed to probe the internal dynamics of protoneutron star matter. Additionally, we track the evolution of macroscopic quantities such as energy distribution and gravitational mass and establish direct links between microphysics and global evolution. Extending the framework of Phys. Rev. D 112, 023007 (2025), which focuses on the global properties of rotating protoneutron star evolution, our results reveal that protoneutron star deformation and thermal evolution are governed by angular momentum, mass, and composition. Exotic matter (hyperons and $\\Delta$-resonances) and rapid rotation enhance deformation leading to a reduction in core temperature, whereas slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740$+$6620 remain nearly spherical. Our predicted equatorial radii for PSR J0740$+$6620, $13.0\\ \\mathrm{km} < R\\_e < 13.5\\ \\mathrm{km}$, are consistent with NICER measurements.

Using 13.1 years of IceCube data, we present a follow-up search for neutrino sources in the northern sky. NGC 1068 remains the most significant neutrino source among 110 preselected gamma-ray emitters while also being spatially compatible with the most significant location in the northern sky. Its energy spectrum is characterized by an unbroken power-law with spectral index $\\gamma = 3.4 \\pm 0.2$. Consistent with previous results, the observed neutrino flux exceeds its gamma-ray counterpart by at least two orders of magnitude. Motivated by this disparity and the high X-ray luminosity of the source, we selected 47 X-ray bright Seyfert galaxies from the Swift/BAT spectroscopic survey that were not included in the list of gamma-ray emitters. When testing this collection for neutrino emission, we observe a 3.3$\\sigma$ excess from an ensemble of 11 sources, with NGC 1068 excluded from the sample.

However, the conventional scotogenic dark matter usually suffers stringent constraints from the non-observation of lepton flavor violation and direct detection. To generate the non-zero neutrino masses, at least two generations of dark particles are required. For example, two real scalar singlets $\\phi\\_1$ and $\\phi\\_2$ are involved in the scotogenic inverse model, which are odd under the $Z\\_2$ symmetry. In this paper, we consider the masses of dark scalars are nearly degenerate $m\\_{\\phi\\_1}\\lesssim m\\_{\\phi\\_2}$, which opens new viable pathway for the generation of dark matter $\\phi\\_1$, such as the coscattering process $\\phi\\_1\\text{SM}\\to \\phi\\_2 \\text{SM}$ and coannihilation processes $\\phi\\_1 \\phi\\_2 \\to \\text{SM SM}$ via the Higgs portal or Yukawa portal interactions. We explore the parameter space to produce the correct relic density through coscattering, as well as the contrastive coannihilation channel.

The extended code self-consistently evolves nuclear species coupled to hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, and neutrino radiation transport under the conformal flatness approximation to Einstein's equations. Four approximate nuclear networks are included, with stiff source terms integrated using implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Validation is performed through benchmarks including conserved-to-primitive recovery with a tabulated stellar equation of state, one-zone silicon burning, and hydrodynamic tests of shock tubes, acoustic pulses, and detonation fronts of Type Ia supernovae. These tests confirm accurate coupling between nuclear reactions and fluid dynamics, conserving electron and nuclear mass fractions to machine precision.   As an application, we conduct spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova simulations. The models reproduce the expected non-exploding behavior of standard progenitors, while enhanced neutrino heating revives the shock. Including nuclear burning modifies the post-shock composition and dynamics, converting silicon and oxygen layers into iron-group nuclei and strengthening the explosion. This demonstrates the impact of explosive burning on ejecta composition and shock evolution, and establishes the stability of the coupled GR radiation-MHD-nuclear framework. The implementation is fully compatible with multidimensional GRMHD simulations and represents the first GRRMHD code combining M1 neutrino transport with fully coupled nuclear burning.\n\n", "2510.12900": "2025-10-14, **Updated Constraints on Large Extra Dimensions from Reactor Antineutrino Experiments**, T.

Specifically, we analyze the full data sets from Daya Bay, RENO, KamLAND, NEOS, and STEREO to derive updated bounds.

Furthermore, we present new limits on $4+d$ LED scenarios, with $d = 2, 3, 4$ denoting the number of extra dimensions, based on the same reactor data and assuming equal radii for all extra dimensions. We find that the constraints become increasingly stringent with a larger number of extra dimensions. In particular, $d = 4$ with a massless lightest active neutrino, we obtain limits of $a \\lesssim 0.28~{\\rm \\mu m}$ for normal and $a \\lesssim 0.05~{\\rm \\mu m}$ for inverted orderings at the $99\\%$ confidence level.\n\n", "2510.12873": "2025-10-14, **New Spallation Background Rejection Techniques to Greatly Improve the Solar Neutrino Sensitivity of JUNO**, Obada Nairat et.al., [2510.12873v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12873v1)\n\n While the potential of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure solar neutrinos is known, realizing this potential requires new techniques to reduce detector backgrounds. One of the most serious backgrounds is due to the beta decays of unstable nuclei produced through muon breakup (spallation) of nuclei. This background is much more significant in JUNO compared to Super-Kamiokande due to JUNO's shallower depth and its lack of directional information. We present the first detailed theoretical calculations of spallation backgrounds in JUNO, showing the underlying physical processes and new ways to cut backgrounds while preserving signals. A key point is showing the importance of neutron tagging to identify hadronic showers, which are rare but produce almost all of the dangerous isotopes. With our new techniques, JUNO will be able to reduce deadtime (signal loss) by a factor of five and to reduce the running time needed to meet sensitivity goals by a factor of two. This will give JUNO greatly improved sensitivity to $^8$B and $hep$ solar neutrinos, as we will explore in a separate paper.\n\n", "2510.12661": "2025-10-14, **Measurement of the tau anomalous magnetic moment using Ultra-peripheral collisions with the ALICE detector in Run 3 Pb-Pb data**, Roman Lavi\u010dka et.al., [2510.12661v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12661v1)\n\n The anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton ($a\\_{\\tau}$) is a sensitive probe for the search for deviations from the Standard Model predictions and thus for new physics. This study investigates the feasibility of measuring $a\\_{\\tau}$ using ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) at the LHC, where photon-photon interactions ($\\gamma\\gamma \\to \\tau^+ \\tau^-$) produce tau lepton pairs. We focus on events recorded by the ALICE detector during Run 3 Pb-Pb data-taking.

These samples are enhanced with decays into muons, which are inseparable in the ALICE detector. The clean environment of UPCs minimizes hadronic background, while the advanced particle identification capabilities of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and Time-of-Flight (TOF) systems allow for efficient separation of electrons, pions, and background particles. In this talk, prospects for measuring this process by ALICE in Run 3, which benefits from high statistics and improved systematics uncertainties, will be discussed.

By analyzing the latest Run 0 and Run 1 datasets from the PandaX-4T experiment, together with recent results from XENONnT, we derive new constraints on each electromagnetic property of neutrino. We present both flavor-independent results, obtained using a common parameter for all three neutrino flavors, and flavor-dependent results, derived by marginalizing over the three neutrino flavor components.

Among the best-motivated candidates are heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) - heavier counterparts of Standard Model neutrinos - which can account for the origin of neutrino masses and potentially produce di-leptonic DV signatures.   In this study, we demonstrate how existing DV searches at the LHC can be extended to probe HNLs that couple predominantly to the tau-neutrino flavor. While current search strategies rely on identifying a prompt lepton alongside a displaced vertex, we show that analyzing events without a prompt lepton enables sensitivity to the process $pp \\to W \\to \\tau N$, where the tau decays hadronically and the HNL subsequently decays to a lepton pair and a neutrino.   We perform detailed Monte Carlo simulations of this process with HNLs decaying to $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ or $e^+e^-$ final states, apply ATLAS-inspired selection criteria, and optimize signal sensitivity. In particular, we demonstrate that appropriate cuts in the plane of di-lepton invariant mass and DV radial position significantly enhance signal visibility. We propose several such optimized strategies and show that even with Run 2 data $139~\\text{fb}^{-1}$ , existing bounds can be improved by more than an order of magnitude.

We demonstrate that with CP violation induced by Yukawa couplings, equal and opposite lepton asymmetries are generated in the visible and hidden sectors. Subsequent evolution preserves lepton number separately in each sector, and sphaleron interactions partially convert the lepton asymmetry into baryon asymmetry near the temperature of the first-order phase transition.

We study how the companion's spin controls this process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of the companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane. Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \\simeq 2.8$, much larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from dynamical friction.\n\n", "2510.13477": "2025-10-15, **Probing Primordial black holes with the distortion of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background**, Mingqi Sun et.al., [2510.13477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13477v1)\n\n The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), arising from the incoherent superposition of numerous compact binary coalescences, serves as a powerful probe of both astrophysical populations and fundamental physics.

Assuming PBHs as dark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their lensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced effects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying the PBH mass (M\\_PBH) and abundance (f\\_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass predominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the spectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced deviation.

These portals give rise to several possible new particles beyond the SM, such as light Higgs bosons, dark photons, and axion-like particles.

While the widely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for their formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in isolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the so-called \"Fujii relation\") and linearly on disk hotness and thickness. However, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body models of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random motions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo, we explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing bar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both prograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short timescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for moderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to accelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo spin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might arise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the dark matter halo.\n\n", "2510.13129": "2025-10-15, **Numerical Cosmology**, Romain Teyssier et.al., [2510.13129v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13129v1)\n\n In these lecture notes, we describe the current state-of-the-art for numerical simulations of large-scale structure and galaxy formation.

We show that bound systems composed of these halos are capable of generating gravitational wave (GW) signals detectable today, even when the individual halos are very light. The Yukawa force dominates the dynamics of these halo binaries, rather than gravity. As a result, large GW signals can be produced at initially extremely high frequencies, which are then redshifted to frequency bands accessible to current or future GW observatories. In addition, the resulting GW signals carry distinctive features that enable future observations to distinguish them from conventional ones.

In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is not sufficiently strong as to disrupt virialised structures.\n\n", "2510.12396": "2025-10-14, **Search for dark matter production in association with bottom quarks and a lepton pair in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV**, CMS Collaboration et.al., [2510.12396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12396v1)\n\n A search is performed for dark matter produced in association with bottom quarks and a pair of electrons or muons in data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to 138 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.

The latter acts as a dark matter mediator in the context of the two Higgs doublet model plus a pseudoscalar (2HDM+a). Multivariate techniques that target a wide range of mass configurations for the H and a particles are used. The observations are consistent with the expectations from standard model processes.

Further, the barred MWAs consistently show lower $Q\\_{T}^{\\min}$ than unbarred ones.

Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored.

While deep learning models have been explored, they are often resource-intensive and lack interpretability. We present a computationally efficient and interpretable classification framework that maintains high performance on imbalanced datasets.

We use two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source, varying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We post-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport code to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the centre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently powerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and accelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of the engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing high-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical impact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon escape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of low-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially hot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic supernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity material near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow emission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae.

However, direct and extensive age measurements of SN host galaxies reveal a significant (5.5{\\sigma}) correlation between standardized SN magnitude and progenitor age, which is expected to introduce a serious systematic bias with redshift in SN cosmology.

After correcting for this age-bias as a function of redshift, the SN dataset aligns more closely with the w0waCDM model recently suggested by the DESI BAO project from a combined analysis using only BAO and CMB data. This result is further supported by an evolution-free test that uses only SNe from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range.

Recent attempts at explaining them have combined 3-dimensional hydrodynamical supernova explosion simulations with 1-dimensional stellar modelling to explain the impact of supernova shocks on runaway white dwarfs. However, only the hottest and most compact of those runaway stars can so far marginally be reproduced by detailed models of runaways from supernova explosions.

We map this object into MESA, and show that this runaway star can explain the observations of two hypervelocity stars that were dubbed D6-1 and D6-3 based on their original discovery motivated by the D6 scenario, though the violent merger scenario presented here is somewhat distinct from the D6 scenario.\n\n", "2510.12079": "2025-10-14, **Short-Lived Radioisotopic enrichment from AGB interlopers in low-mass star-forming regions**, Joseph W. Eatson et.al., [2510.12079v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12079v1)\n\n The decay of Short-Lived Radioisotopes (SLRs) can be a significant source of heating early in protoplanetary systems, though how a protoplanetary disk becomes enriched with these SLRs far above the galactic background level remains an open question. Observational evidence suggests that this enrichment occurs during the period from when the disk forms to when it progresses into a protoplanetary system, and is homogenous throughout the resultant planetary system. Whilst SLRs such as 26Al and 60Fe can be injected into disks through interaction with Wolf-Rayet winds and supernovae, these outflows can disrupt disks, and in the case of low-mass star-forming regions high-mass stars may not form at all. Recent research has determined the existence of AGB ``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through star-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to WR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers on star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the enrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous N-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment is widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time at which the interloper intersects the star-forming region. Velocity is a factor, though interlopers travelling at 30 km/s are capable of enriching many disks in a star-forming region assuming they encounter a disk when the interloper is more evolved.\n\n"}}
