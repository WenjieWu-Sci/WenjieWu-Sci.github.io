We demonstrate that this setup can simultaneously produce an inflaton and baryon asymmetry in the early universe, provide a dark matter candidate and explain the smallness of neutrino masses. The two triplets are particularly important as they become mediators for the production of dark matter and the generation of lepton asymmetry, as well as contribute an inflaton. The inert doublet results in a dark matter candidate. The required CP-violation for lepton asymmetry is obtained by interference between the triplet mediators that communicate the dark sector to the SM sector. More precisely, the complex Breit-Wigner propagators of the triplets and their mixing, result in an asymmetric production of leptons and antileptons that is boosted before dark matter freeze-out. In this case, simultaneously achieving enough dark matter relic abundance and proper matter-antimatter asymmetry limits the available parameter space of the model. Moreover, the scalar triplets are coupled non-minimally to gravity and give rise to the inflaton. We calculate the inflationary parameters and check that we can obtain predictions consistent with Planck constraints from 2018.

We examine two spin problems, one with random all-to-all couplings inspired by neutrino flavor evolution in supernovae, and the standard Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian on a $4 \\times 3$ lattice. The neutrino Hamiltonian has the total spin $J$ and third component $J\\_{\\rm{z}}$ as its only symmetries. The Heisenberg model has these symmetries plus translational invariance and reflection symmetry.   We demonstrate that the convergence of variational methods is dramatically improved by keeping all symmetries. In both cases a nearly exact solution can be obtained in cases where standard unconstrained variational algorithms fail. Since variational algorithms can use standard Trotter steps as part of the optimization, allowing additional correlations that obey all the symmetries of the Hamiltonian will speed convergence of variational algorithms. This will lead to faster convergence than standard projection algorithms.\n\n", "2510.06665": "2025-10-08, **Doping of a Borexino-like Liquid Scintillator with Tellurium-Diols**, Hans Th. J.

Therefore,a novel and completely water-free synthesis in a non-acidic organic environment at room temperature was used.

Both the emission spectrum and transmission remained nearly unchanged,even at high doping levels. The reduction in light yield was moderate, with approximately 8,400 photons emitted for a 1 MeV energy deposition by an electron at 1$\\%$ tellurium loading.

The hypothesis offers a phenomenological resolution to the $\\theta\\_{23}$ octant ambiguity, reproduces the known mass hierarchy patterns, and suggests a normalized geometric structure underlying the PMNS mixing.

J\u00falio et.al., [2510.06905v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06905v1)\n\n A tight correlation between the baryonic and observed acceleration of galaxies has been reported over a wide range of mass ($10^8 < M\\_{\\rm bar}/{\\rm M}\\_\\odot < 10^{11}$) - the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR). This has been interpreted as evidence that dark matter is actually a manifestation of some modified weak-field gravity theory.

We use stellar line-of-sight velocities and the Jeans modelling code GravSphere to infer the mass distributions of these galaxies, allowing us to compute the RAR. We compare the results with the EDGE simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies with similar stellar masses in a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that most of the observed dwarf galaxies lie systematically above the low-mass extrapolation of the RAR. Each galaxy traces a locus in the RAR space that can have a multi-valued observed acceleration for a given baryonic acceleration, while there is significant scatter from galaxy to galaxy. Our results indicate that the RAR does not apply to low-mass dwarf galaxies and that the inferred baryonic acceleration of these dwarfs does not contain enough information, on its own, to derive the observed acceleration. The simulated EDGE dwarfs behave similarly to the real data, lying systematically above the extrapolated RAR. We show that, in the context of modified weak-field gravity theories, these results cannot be explained by differential tidal forces from the Milky Way, nor by the galaxies being far from dynamical equilibrium, since none of the galaxies in our sample seems to experience strong tides. As such, our results provide further evidence for the need for invisible dark matter in the smallest dwarf galaxies.\n\n", "2510.06500": "2025-10-07, **Study of few-electron backgrounds in the LUX-ZEPLIN detector**, D.

The major challenge in exploiting this sensitivity is to understand and suppress the ionization background in the few-electron regime.

In addition to these effects, the impact of a galactic major merger on a population of stellar streams remains to be explored. Here, we focus on the emergence and longevity of asymmetries between the leading and trailing tails of streams caused by such interactions. We run collisionless N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy hosting 36 globular cluster streams and merging with a perturber galaxy. We propose a new asymmetry metric to quantify the structural differences between both tails from their respective cumulative density profiles. We find that the over- and under-densities along streams induced by the merger depend on the orbital characteristics of their progenitors. The non-simultaneity of this effect from stream to stream implies that global asymmetry signatures are less prominent than in individual cases. These population-averaged imprints remain detectable over only 2.5 Gyr but asymmetric signatures can persist over much longer periods for individual streams with wide orbits that have been perturbed prior to coalescence. We thus caution that the interpretation of streams' morphology in the context of dark matter mapping is strongly subject to degeneracies and should be performed considering the merger history of the host.\n\n", "2510.06312": "2025-10-07, **New ultralight scalar particles and the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs -- the important role of Sirius B**, Kai Bartnick et.al., [2510.06312v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06312v1)\n\n We present the equation of state for two classes of new ultralight particles, a scalar field coupling to electrons and a light $\\mathbb{Z}\\_\\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion field coupling to nucleons.

Assuming this claim is correct, we investigate the constraints that arise if such cores are produced by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We derive the range of SIDM cross-sections (sigma/m) required to reproduce the observed core sizes. These can result from halos in either the core-formation phase (low sigma/m) or the core-collapse phase (high sigma/m), yielding a wide allowed range (sim 0.3 -- 200 cm2/g) consistent with values reported in the literature for more massive galaxies. We also construct a simple model relating stellar mass to core radius - two observables likely connected in SIDM. This model reproduces the stellar core sizes and masses in UFDs with sigma/m consistent with those derived above. It also predicts a trend of increasing core radius with stellar mass, in agreement with observations of more massive dwarf galaxies. The model central DM densities match observations when assuming the SIDM profile to originate from an initial CDM halo that follows the mass-concentration relation. Since stellar feedback is insufficient to form cores in these galaxies, UFDs unbiasedly anchor sigma/m at low velocities. If the core-collapse scenario holds (i.e., high sigma/m), UFD halos are thermalized on kpc scales, approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the stellar cores. These large thermalization scales could potentially influence substructure formation in more massive systems.\n\n", "2510.05630": "2025-10-07, **Self-Interacting Sub-GeV Dark Matter with Strong MeV Gamma-ray**, Yu Watanabe et.al., [2510.05630v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05630v1)\n\n Sub-GeV dark matter (DM) with $s$-channel resonant self-scattering provides a promising framework for addressing small-scale structure problems. However, models that also account for the observed relic abundance through the same resonance are strongly constrained by current $\\gamma$-ray observations, since the associated signals are significantly enhanced. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework in which the relic abundance and self-scattering are governed independently by two distinct mediators. As a concrete realization, we present a singlet scalar DM model in which self-scattering is mediated by a vector boson associated with a gauged baryon number, while the relic density is determined by forbidden annihilation into dark Higgs bosons that generate the gauge boson mass. By imposing cosmological, experimental, and theoretical constraints, We identify viable parameter regions that reproduce the observed relic density, alleviate small-scale problems, and remain consistent with current bounds.

Improvement on the $H_{0}$ Inference from Pixelized Cluster Strong Lens Modeling**, Yushan Xie et.al., [2510.07131v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07131v1)\n\n Strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) provide a powerful, independent method to measure the Hubble constant, $H\\_{0}$, through time delays between their multiple images. The accuracy of this measurement depends critically on both the precision of time delay estimation and the robustness of lens modeling. In many current cluster-scale modeling algorithms, all multiple images used for modeling are simplified as point sources to reduce computational costs. In the first paper of the CURLING program, we demonstrated that such a point-like approximation can introduce significant uncertainties and biases in both magnification reconstruction and cosmological inference. In this study, we explore how such simplifications affect $H\\_0$ measurements from glSNe. We simulate a lensed supernova at $z=1.95$, lensed by a galaxy cluster at $z=0.336$, assuming time delays are measured from LSST-like light curves. The lens model is constructed using JWST-like imaging data, utilizing both Lenstool and a pixelated method developed in CURLING. Under a fiducial cosmology with $H\\_0=70\\rm \\ km \\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}$, the Lenstool model yields $H\\_0=69.91^{+6.27}\\_{-5.50}\\rm \\ km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}$, whereas the pixelated framework improves the precision by over an order of magnitude, $H\\_0=70.39^{+0.82}\\_{-0.60}\\rm \\ km \\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}$. Our results indicate that in the next-generation observations (e.g., JWST), uncertainties from lens modeling dominate the error budget for $H\\_0$ inference, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the extended surface brightness of multiple images to fully leverage the potential of glSNe for cosmology.\n\n", "2510.06667": "2025-10-08, **Ionized gas components in low surface brightness galaxy AGC 111629**, Tian-Wen Cao et.al., [2510.06667v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06667v1)\n\n We present integral field spectroscopy of ionized gas components in AGC 111629, an edge-on low surface brightness galaxy (LSBG) with a stellar mass of 5.7$\\times$10$^{8}$ M$\\_{\\odot}$.

Johnson et.al., [2510.06310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06310v1)\n\n In dwarf galaxy models, outflows expel metal-enriched interstellar medium (ISM) into the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to reproduce their observed low metallicities, but measurements of dwarf CGM properties are scarce. We present a study of the CGM of an isolated dwarf at $z=0.5723$ with a stellar mass of $\\approx5\\times10^7\\rm\\,M\\_{\\odot}$ and star-formation rate ($\\approx0.05\\,\\rm M\\_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}$) and ISM metallicity ($\\rm [O/H]\\approx-0.9$) consistent with the star-forming main sequence and mass-metallicity relation. A background quasar sightline with archival UV spectra probes the dwarf's CGM at a projected distance of 28 kpc, corresponding to approximately half of the estimated virial radius. The dwarf's CGM is detected in H I, intermediate metal ions of C III, O III, and O IV, and kinematically broader, highly-ionized O VI, but is undetected in N IV and Ne VIII. Photoionization modeling of the intermediate ions indicates a modest volume-filling factor ($\\sim 6\\%$ along the sightline or $\\sim 2\\%$ globally), and a mass of $\\sim2\\times10^8 {\\rm\\,M\\_\\odot}$, $\\sim4\\times$ higher than the dwarf's stellar mass, but $\\sim10\\times$ less than the highly ionized CGM. The O VI kinematics are comparable to the dwarf's estimated virial velocity, suggesting it is likely associated with cool, photoionized, and volume-filling CGM, with bulk motion or turbulence dominating over thermal pressure. The metallicity inferred for the intermediate ions is $\\rm [O/H]=-0.6$, but with low relative abundances of $\\rm [C/O]=-0.6$ and $\\rm [N/O]<-0.9$. The [N/O] is below levels expected of the dwarf's ISM, but consistent with core-collapse supernova ejecta, suggesting that supernova-enriched gas escaped the dwarf without mixing significantly with ISM enriched in nitrogen from evolved, low-mass stars.\n\n", "2510.06134": "2025-10-07, **Resolving Star Cluster Formation in Galaxy Simulations with Cosmic Ray Feedback**, Brandon Sike et.al., [2510.06134v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06134v1)\n\n Star clusters host the massive stars responsible for feedback in star-forming galaxies. Stellar feedback shapes the interstellar medium (ISM), affecting the formation of future star clusters. To self-consistently capture the interplay between feedback and star formation, a model must resolve the parsec-scale star formation sites and the multiphase ISM. Additionally, the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on star formation rates (SFRs) must also be considered. We present the first simulations of the formation of an ensemble of star clusters with dynamically-coupled CRs, near-individual star particles, and a feedback-regulated ISM. We analyze tallbox simulations performed using the CRISP model in the moving-mesh code AREPO. We apply varied implementations of CR transport under the theory of self-confinement. We find that CRs simultaneously reduce the SFR, the power law slope of the cluster mass function, and the cluster formation efficiency. Each simulation is compatible with observations, and CR feedback tends to move results along observed star cluster relations. We see only modest changes in cluster radius and velocity dispersions, but significant differences in the virial parameters. Ultimately, the primary impact of CRs is to reduce SFRs. Lower SFRs imply fewer supernovae, and consequently a lower turbulent energy budget for gas. Star clusters formed in a CR-regulated ISM have lower velocity dispersions, and are therefore more bound under self-gravity. The effective clustering of SNe is unchanged by CRs. Through this work, we demonstrate the predictive power of the CRISP feedback model, despite this idealized setup.\n\n", "2510.06043": "2025-10-07, **The influence of rotation and metallicity on the explodability of massive stars**, Renyu Luo et.al., [2510.06043v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06043v1)\n\n During the late stages of massive stellar evolution, failed supernovae (FSN) may form through core-collapse processes. The traditional evaluation criterion $\\xi\\_{2.5}$ $=$ 0.45, primarily established using non-rotating progenitor models, suffers from significant inaccuracies when applied to rotating pre-supernova systems. The effects of metallicity and rotation on the explodability landscapes of massive stars lack robust quantification. We aim to investigate how rotation and metallicity influence the explodability of massive stars. We investigate how rotation and metallicity affect stellar explodability using MESA simulations with initial rotational velocities of $0$, $300$, and $600~\\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at three metallicities ($Z\\_{\\odot}$, $1/10,Z\\_{\\odot}$, $1/50,Z\\_{\\odot}$). Core-collapse phases are simulated with GR1D to determine critical heating efficiencies. Our results yield revised $\\xi\\_{2.5}$ criteria: 0.45 for non-rotating models; 0.48 for $300~\\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$; 0.47 for $600~\\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at solar metallicity; and 0.59 for low-metallicity models. Chemically homogeneous evolution in rapidly rotating low-metallicity stars significantly raises the compactness limit for successful explosions and narrows the zero-age main sequence mass range for failed supernovae. Rotation substantially affects the explodability of low-metallicity massive stars, underscoring the importance of incorporating rotational effects in models of core-collapse supernova progenitors.\n\n", "2510.05712": "2025-10-07, **Abundance Pattern Fitting with Bayesian Inference: Constraining First Stars' Properties and Their Explosion Mechanism with Extremely Metal-poor Stars**, Ruizheng Jiang et.al., [2510.05712v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05712v1)\n\n The abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars preserve a fossil record of the Universe's earliest chemical enrichment by the supernova explosions from the evolution of first generation of stars, also referred to as Population III (or Pop III). By applying Bayesian inference to the analysis of abundance patterns of these ancient stars, this study presents a systematic investigation into the properties and explosion mechanism of Pop III stars. We apply NLTE corrections to enhance the reliability of abundance measurements, which significantly reduces the discrepancies in abundances between observations and theoretical yields for odd-Z elements, such as Na and Al. Our Bayesian framework also enables the incorporation of explodability and effectively mitigates biases introduced by varying resolutions across different supernova model grids. In addition to confirming a top-heavy ($\\alpha=0.54$) initial mass function for massive Pop III stars, we derive a robust mass--energy relation ($E\\propto M^2$) of the first supernovae. These findings demonstrate that stellar abundance analysis provides a powerful and independent approach for probing early supernova physics and the fundamental nature of the first stars.\n\n", "2510.05579": "2025-10-07, **Luminosity distance dispersion in Swiss-cheese cosmology as a function of the hole size distribution**, Thippayawis Cheunchitra et.al., [2510.05579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05579v1)\n\n The luminosity distance-redshift ($D\\_{\\rm L}$--$z$) relation derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) yields evidence for a nonzero cosmological constant. SNe Ia analyses typically fit to the functional form $D\\_{\\rm L}(z)$ derived theoretically from the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Yet, the metric in the epoch relevant to SNe Ia measurements deviates slightly from FLRW due to gravitational clumping of mass into large-scale structures like filaments and voids, whose sizes span many orders of magnitude. The small deviation is modeled typically by scalar perturbations to the FLRW metric. Each line of sight to a SNe Ia passes through a random sequence of structures, so $D\\_{\\rm L}$ differs stochastically from one line of sight to the next. Here, we calculate the $D\\_{\\rm L}$ dispersion in an exact Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese universe with a power-law hole size distribution, as a function of the lower cut-off $R\\_{\\rm min}$ and logarithmic slope $\\gamma$.
