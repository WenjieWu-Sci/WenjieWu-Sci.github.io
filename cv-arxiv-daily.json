Ivanchik et.al., [2404.07081v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07081v1)\n\n Nowadays, at least two relics of the Big Bang have survived - the cosmological microwave background (CMB) and the cosmological neutrino background (C$\\nu$B). Being the second most abundant particle in the Universe, the neutrino has a significant impact on its evolution from the Big Bang to the present day. Neutrinos affect the following cosmological processes: the expansion rate of the Universe, its chemical and isotopic composition, the CMB anisotropy and the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Another relic neutrino background is theoretically predicted, it consists of non-equilibrium antineutrinos of Primordial Nucleosynthesis arising as a result of the decays of neutrons and tritium nuclei. Such antineutrinos are an indicator of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In addition to experimentally detectable active neutrinos, the existence of sterile neutrinos is theoretically predicted to generate neutrino masses and explain their oscillations. Sterile neutrinos can also solve such cosmological problems as the baryonic asymmetry of the Universe and the nature of dark matter. The recent results of several independent experiments point to the possibility of the existence of a light sterile neutrino. However, the existence of such a neutrino is inconsistent with the predictions of the Standard Cosmological Model. The inclusion of a non-zero lepton asymmetry of the Universe and/or increasing the energy density of active neutrinos can eliminate these contradictions and reconcile the possible existence of sterile neutrinos with Primordial Nucleosynthesis, the CMB anisotropy, and also reduce the H$\\_0$-tension. In this brief review, we discuss the influence of the physical properties of active and sterile neutrinos on the evolution of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present day.\n\n", "2404.06867": "2024-04-10, **A correlation between hard X-rays and neutrinos in radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN**, Emma Kun et.al., [2404.06867v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06867v1)\n\n The production mechanism of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos is not yet understood. A common assumption is that beamed relativistic outflows (jets) driven by accreting black holes are needed to accelerate particles to such high energies to produce high-energy neutrinos. Indeed, the first astrophysical high-energy neutrino source candidate identified by IceCube at a significance level of $>3\\sigma$ was a blazar -- an AGN with an accreting supermassive black hole that drives a relativistic jet directed towards Earth. Recently, IceCube discovered strong evidence that Seyfert galaxies also emit neutrinos, which appears unrelated to jet activity. Here, we show that the neutrino--hard X-ray flux ratio of the blazar TXS 0506+056 is consistent with neutrino production in a $\\gamma$-obscured region near the central supermassive black hole, with the X-ray flux corresponding to reprocessed $\\gamma$-ray emission with flux comparable to that of neutrinos. Similar neutrino--hard X-ray flux ratios were found for three of IceCube's Seyfert galaxies, raising the possibility of a common neutrino production mechanism that may not involve a strong jet.

Beyond the Standard Model particle content, our model introduces additional scalars and fermions. Notably, the light active neutrinos and the first two generations of charged fermions acquire masses at the one-loop level. The model accommodates successful low-scale leptogenesis, permitting the mass of the decaying heavy right-handed neutrino to be as low as 10 TeV.

For the first time, this work explores the hypothesis that galaxy mergers may serve as sources for these high-energy neutrinos. Galaxy mergers can host very high-energy hadronic and photohadronic processes, which may produce very high-energy neutrinos. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis utilizing the galaxy merger data from six catalogs and 10 years of public IceCube muon-track data to quantify any correlation between these mergers and neutrino events. First, we perform the single source search analysis, which reveals that none of the considered galaxy mergers exhibit a statistically significant correlation with high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube. Furthermore, we conduct a stacking analysis with three different weighting schemes to understand if these galaxy mergers can contribute significantly to the diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. We find that upper limits (at $95\\%$ c.l.) of the all flavour high-energy neutrino flux, associated with galaxy mergers considered in this study, at $100$ TeV with spectral index $\\Gamma=-2$ are $2.57\\times 10^{-18}$, $8.51 \\times 10^{-19}$ and $2.36 \\times 10^{-18}$ $\\rm GeV^{-1}\\,cm^2\\,s^{-1}\\,sr^{-1}$ for the three weighting schemes.

Here, we apply an inference framework - specifically: statistical data assimilation (SDA) - to neutrino flavor evolution in the Sun. We take a model for solar neutrino flavor evolution, together with Earth-based neutrino measurements, to infer solar properties. Specifically, we ask what signature of the radially-varying solar electron number density $n\\_e(r)$ is contained within these Earth-based measurements.

Matute et.al., [2404.06223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06223v1)\n\n Sterile neutrinos as source of the mass and flavor mixing of active neutrinos as well as genesis of the dark matter (DM) and matter-antimatter asymmetry have gained special interest. Here we study the case of the Standard Model (SM) extended with three right-handed (RH) neutrinos and a dark sector with two extra sterile neutrinos, odd under a discrete $Z\\_2$ symmetry. The RH neutrinos are responsible for producing the baryon asymmetry via the high-scale unflavored leptogenesis. They are superheavy and their abundance at the electroweak broken stage is vanishingly small, so that they have no impact on the phenomenology at low energies. The two dark neutrinos generate the tiny mass of two active neutrinos through a mechanism similar to the minimal linear seesaw, and saturate the relic abundance as freeze-in DM via decay of the heavy SM bosons. The absence of the dark Majorana mass terms in the dark linear seesaw is explained by invoking a hidden symmetry, the so-called presymmetry, and the DM candidate appears in the form of a quasi-Dirac neutrino. The $Z\\_2$ symmetry is broken in the dark neutrino sector, but exact in the realm of RH neutrinos. The required coupling weakness for the freeze-in DM neutrino is related to a very small breach of unitarity in the active neutrino mixing matrix. We show how phenomenological constraints on the production and decay of the DM neutrino imply an upper bound around 1 MeV for its mass and unitarity up to $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ for the mixing matrix.\n\n", "2404.05927": "2024-04-09, **Remnant masses from 1D+ core-collapse supernovae simulations: bimodal neutron star mass distribution and black holes in the low-mass gap**, Luca Boccioli et.al., [2404.05927v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05927v1)\n\n The explosion of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is an extremely challenging problem, and there are still large uncertainties regarding which stars lead to successful explosions that leave behind a neutron star, and which ones will form a black hole instead. In this paper, we simulate 341 progenitors at three different metallicities using spherically symmetric simulations that include neutrino-driven convection via a mixing-length theory. We use these simulations to improve previously derived explosion criteria based on the density and entropy profiles of the pre-supernova progenitor. We also provide numerical fits to calculate the final mass of neutron stars based on either compactness, the location of the Si/Si-O interface, or the Chandrasekhar mass. The neutron star birth mass distribution derived from our 1D+ simulations is bimodal, contrary to what the most popular 1D CCSN simulations have shown so far. We compare the theoretically derived neutron star mass distributions with the observed ones and discuss potential implications for population synthesis studies. We also analyze the black hole mass distribution predicted by our simulations. To be consistent with current models of matter ejection in failed SNe, a large fraction of the envelope must be expelled, leading to small black holes in the low-mass gap. One black hole in this mass region has recently been observed in the GW230529 event by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Our results naturally agree with this detection, which the most popular prescriptions for explodability and remnant masses are not able to reproduce. In general, we find that the explosion outcome and mass of the remnant strongly depend on the pre-collapse structure of the progenitor. However, their dependence on the initial mass of the star and the mass of the CO core is highly uncertain and non-linear.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2404.07196": "2024-04-10, **One-loop power spectrum in ultra slow-roll inflation and implications for primordial black hole dark matter**, Guillermo Ballesteros et.al., [2404.07196v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07196v1)\n\n We apply the in-in formalism to address the question of whether the size of the one-loop spectrum of curvature fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation models designed for producing a large population of primordial black holes implies a breakdown of perturbation theory. We consider a simplified piece-wise description of inflation, in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is preceded and followed by slow-roll phases linked by transitional periods. We work in the $\\delta\\phi$-gauge, including all relevant cubic and quartic interactions and the necessary counterterms to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences, regularized by a cutoff. The ratio of the one-loop to the tree-level contributions to the spectrum of curvature perturbations is controlled by the duration of the ultra-slow-roll phase and of the transitions.

We observe that the enhancement of such capturing is particularly significant when the DM velocity and/or momentum transfer depend on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section. This could potentially lead to the formation of a black hole within the typical lifetime of the NS. As the black hole expands through the accretion of matter from the NS, it ultimately results in the collapse of the host. Utilizing the existing pulsar data J0437-4715 and J2124-3858, we derive the stringent constraints on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section across a broad range of DM masses.\n\n", "2404.06982": "2024-04-10, **Search for a light muon-philic $Z'$ with the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN**, Yu.

This study is motivated by observations from the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, which does not exclude the possibility of the existence of such black holes.

This geometry consists of closely packed, overlapping coaxial cavities operating as a single resonator. While the resonant frequency is still determined by the dimensions of the individual \"cells,\" the strong interactions between the cells encourage the entire \"beehive\" to oscillate in phase, a phenomenon expected of tightly coupled harmonic oscillators. This synchronization behavior allows the construction of a singly connected large-volume resonator at high frequency by simply increasing the number of the cells. Using direct numerical simulations, we verify the existence of a global eigenmode that has a high (40%) form factor in a 169-element beehive resonator. The resonant frequency of the eigenmode is tunable by moving the center rods laterally in unison. The form factor is very tolerant to dimensional deviations and misalignment, as a result of mode hybridization due to strong coupling. The beehive haloscope inherits many appealing properties from the conventional coaxial cavity: a high quality factor, compatibility with a solenoid magnet, ease of fabrication, tuning, and coupling. We argue that this geometry is an excellent candidate for high-mass axion searches covering the post-inflationary parameter space (>5 GHz).\n\n", "2404.06584": "2024-04-09, **Relativistic Khronon Theory in agreement with Modified Newtonian Dynamics and Large-Scale Cosmology**, Luc Blanchet et.al., [2404.06584v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06584v1)\n\n We propose an extension of General Relativity (GR) based on a space-time foliation by three-dimensional space-like hypersurfaces labeled by the Khronon scalar field $\\tau$.

Specifically, the galaxy appears to have an extremely low-density halo and a high baryon fraction, while CDM predicts dwarfs to have very dense and dominant dark haloes. The alleged tension relies on the galaxy's rotation curve decomposition, which depends heavily on its inclination. This inclination, estimated from the gas morphology, remains somewhat uncertain.

This leads to a tension between high scale inflation and QCD axions with Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale decay constants, which reduces the potential for a detection of tensor modes at next generation CMB experiments. We propose a mechanism that excplicitly breaks PQ symmetry via non-minimal coupling to gravity, that lifts the axion mass above the Hubble scale during inflation and has negligible impact on today's axion potential. The initially heavy axion gets trapped at an intermediate minimum during inflation given by the phase of the non-minimal coupling, before it moves to its true CP-conserving minimum after inflation. During this stage it undergoes coherent oscillations around an adiabatically decreasing minimum, which slightly dilutes the axion energy density, while still being able to explain the observed dark matter relic abundance.

In this work we present a new, `zero-coupling infrared fixed point' approach, which allows a larger proportion of models in this framework to generically relate the masses of the visible and dark matter particles. Due to the heavy mass scale required for the new field content, we introduce supersymmetry to the theory. We consider how these models may be incorporated in a full theory of asymmetric dark matter, presenting some example leptogenesis-like models. We also discuss the phenomenology of these models; in particular, there are gravitational wave signals which, while weak, may be measurable at future mHz and $\\mu$Hz detectors.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2404.07182": "2024-04-10, **Studying the Supernova Absolute Magnitude Constancy with Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations**, Denitsa Staicova et.al., [2404.07182v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07182v1)\n\n In this proceeding we review and expand on our recent work investigating the constancy of the absolute magnitude $M\\_B$ of Type Ia supernovae. In it, we used baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) to calibrate the supernova data and to check whether the resulting $M\\_B$ is constant. We used non-parametric methods like Gaussian processes and artificial neural networks to reconstruct $M\\_B(z)$. Here we elaborate on the results by putting them in the context of other studies investigating possible non-constant $M\\_B$ and the impact of the distance-duality relation. We also present some numerical details on the calculations in the original paper and new non-parametric reconstructions, including a conservative model-independent fit, confirming its main results. Notably, we see that $M\\_B$ remains constant within $1\\sigma$, with a possible jump around $z = 0.01 - 0.15$. Furthermore, the observed distribution of $M\\_B(z)$ cannot be described by a single Gaussian, displaying multiple peaks and tails. The choice of the only remaining parameter -- the sound horizon $r\\_d$ leads to a tension in the $M\\_B-r\\_d$ plane. Fitting different non-constant $M\\_B(z)$ models does not significantly improve the fit and there is no preference for any of the models by the statistical measures we employ.\n\n", "2404.07149": "2024-04-10, **Tianyu: search for the second solar system and explore the dynamic universe**, Fabo Feng et.al., [2404.07149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07149v1)\n\n Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, play important roles in the formation and habitability of Earth-like planets. The detection of solar system analogs that have multiple cold giant planets is essential for our understanding of planet habitability and planet formation. Although transit surveys such as Kepler and TESS have discovered thousands of exoplanets, these missions are not sensitive to long period planets due to their limited observation baseline. The Tianyu project, comprising two 1-meter telescopes (Tianyu-I and II), is designed to detect transiting cold giant planets in order to find solar system analogs. Featuring a large field of view and equipped with a high-speed CMOS camera, Tianyu-I will perform a high-precision photometric survey of about 100 million stars, measuring light curves at hour-long cadence. The candidates found by Tianyu-I will be confirmed by Tianyu-II and other surveys and follow-up facilities through multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and high resolution imaging. Tianyu telescopes will be situated at an elevation about 4000 meters in Lenghu, China. With a photometric precision of 1% for stars with V < 18 mag, Tianyu is expected to find more than 300 transiting exoplanets, including about 12 cold giant planets, over five years. A five-year survey of Tianyu would discover 1-2 solar system analogs. Moreover, Tianyu is also designed for non-exoplanetary exploration, incorporating multiple survey modes covering timescales from sub-seconds to months, with a particular emphasis on events occurring within the sub-second to hour range. It excels in observing areas such as infant supernovae, rare variable stars and binaries, tidal disruption events, Be stars, cometary activities, and interstellar objects. These discoveries not only enhance our comprehension of the universe but also offer compelling opportunities for public engagement in scientific exploration.\n\n", "2404.07070": "2024-04-10, **Model independent cosmographic constraints from DESI 2024**, Orlando Luongo et.al., [2404.07070v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07070v1)\n\n In this study, we explore model independent constraints on the universe kinematics up to the snap and jerk hierarchical terms. To do so, we consider the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) release provided by the DESI collaboration, tackling the $r\\_d$ parameter to span within the range $[144,152]$ Mpc, with fixed step, $\\delta r\\_d=2$ Mpc, aligning with Planck and DESI results. Thus, employing Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, we place stringent constraints on the cosmographic series, incorporating three combinations of data catalogs: the first BAO with observational Hubble data, the second BAO with type Ia supernovae, and the last including all three data sets. Our results conclusively constrain the cosmographic series, say the deceleration $q\\_0$, the jerk $j\\_0$, and the snap $s\\_0$ parameters, at the $2$--$\\sigma$ level, showcasing a significant departure on $j\\_0$ even at $1$--$\\sigma$ confidence level, albeit being compatible with the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm on $q\\_0$ and $s\\_0$, at $2$--$\\sigma$ level. Analogously, the $h\\_0$ tension appears alleviated in the second hierarchy, say including snap. Finally, a direct comparison with the $\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM models and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization is reported, definitively favoring the wCDM scenario.\n\n", "2404.06540": "2024-04-09, **Searching for Triple Systems Unbound by Supernovae**, Karina Barboza et.al., [2404.06540v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06540v1)\n\n A large fraction of massive stars are found in higher order systems where the presence of a tertiary may significantly modify the system's evolution. In particular, it can lead to increased numbers of compact object binaries and accelerate their mergers with important implications for gravitational wave observations. Using Gaia, we constrain the number of Galactic supernovae that produce unbound triples. We do this by searching 8 supernova remnants for stars with consistent Gaia parallaxes and paths intersecting near the center of the supernova remnant at a time consistent with the age of the remnant. We find no candidates for unbound triple systems. Combined with prior work, less than 11.4\\% of supernovae leave behind unbound triples at a 90\\% confidence limit. The absence of such systems limits their role in the evolution of massive stars and the formation of merging compact objects.\n\n", "2404.06303": "2024-04-09, **Dynamical dark energy in light of cosmic distance measurements I: a demonstration using simulated datasets**, Gan Gu et.al., [2404.06303v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06303v2)\n\n We develop methods to extract key dark energy information from cosmic distance measurements including the BAO scales and supernovae luminosity distances. Demonstrated using simulated datasets of the complete DESI, LSST and Roman surveys designed for BAO and SNe distance measurements, we show that using our method, the dynamical behaviour of the energy, pressure, equation of state (with its time derivative) of dark energy and the cosmic deceleration function can all be accurately recovered from high-quality data, which allows for robust diagnostic tests for dark energy models.\n\n"}}
