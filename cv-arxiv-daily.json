The NUTRIG project lays the foundations for the development of a pure, efficient, and scalable trigger in the context of GRAND. For this purpose, a GRAND prototype setup of four detection units has been deployed at Nan\\c{c}ay, France, which currently serves as the main testing facility for the deployment of this autonomous trigger. This work provides a detailed description of the GRAND@Nan\\c{c}ay setup, and a first analysis of background data gathered on site. Initial tests of signal recovery in laboratory conditions are also presented. Finally, near-future plans are outlined to scale NUTRIG to larger pathfinder arrays such as GRANDProto300.\n\n", "2307.09460": "2023-07-18, **Probing Light Dark Matter through Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei**, Gonzalo Herrera et.al., [2307.09460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09460v1)\n\n Recent observations of high-energy neutrinos from active galactic nuclei (AGN), NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, suggest that cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole and high-energy protons and electrons can cool efficiently via interactions with ambient photons and gas. The dark matter density may be significantly enhanced near the central black hole, and CRs could lose energies predominantly due to scatterings with the ambient dark matter particles. We propose CR cooling in AGN as a new probe of dark matter-proton and dark matter-electron scatterings. Under plausible astrophysical assumptions, our constraints on sub-GeV dark matter can be the strongest derived to date. Some of the parameter space favored by thermal light dark matter models might already be probed with current multimessenger observations of AGN.\n\n", "2307.09241": "2023-07-18, **Neutrino Cross Sections: Interface of shallow- and deep-inelastic scattering for collider neutrinos**, Yu Seon Jeong et.al., [2307.09241v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09241v1)\n\n Neutrino experiments in a Forward Physics Facility at the Large Hadron Collider can measure neutrino and antineutrino cross sections for energies up to a few TeV. For neutrino energies below 100 GeV, the inelastic cross section evaluations have contributions from weak structure functions at low momentum transfers and low hadronic final state invariant mass. To evaluate the size of these contributions to the neutrino cross section, we use a parametrization of the electron-proton structure function, adapted for neutrino scattering, augmented with a correction to account for the partial conservation of the axial vector current, and normalized to structure functions evaluated at next-to-leading order in QCD, with target mass corrections and heavy quark corrections. We compare our results with other approaches to account for this kinematic region in neutrino cross section for energies between 10--1000 GeV on isoscalar nucleon and iron targets.\n\n", "2307.09170": "2023-07-18, **Hunting for bumps in the diffuse high-energy neutrino flux**, Damiano F.

If they are made in proton-photon interactions in astrophysical sources, their spectrum may show bump-like features. We search for such features in the 7.5-years High-Energy Starting Events (HESE), and forecast the power of such searches using larger data samples expected from upcoming telescopes. Present-day data reveals no evidence of bump-like features, which allows us to constrain candidate populations of photohadronic neutrino sources.

How halos are influenced by neutrinos is vital and interesting, and angular momentum (AM) as a significant feature provides a statistical perspective for this issue. Exploring halos from TianNu N-body cosmological simulation with the co-evolving neutrino particles, we obtain some concrete conclusions. First, by comparing the same halos with and without neutrinos, in contrast to the neutrino-free case, over 89.71\\% of halos have smaller halo moduli, over 71.06\\% have smaller particle-mass-reduced (PMR) AM moduli, and over 95.44\\% change their orientations of less than $0.65^\\circ$. Moreover, the relative variation of PMR modulus is more visible for low-mass halos. Second, to explore the PMR moduli of halos in dense or sparse areas, we divide the whole box into big cubes, and search for halos within a small spherical cell in a single cube. From the two-level divisions, we discover that in denser cubes, the variation of PMR moduli with massive neutrinos decreases more significantly. This distinction suggests that neutrinos exert heavier influence on halos' moduli in compact regions. With massive neutrinos, most halos (86.60\\%) have lower masses than without neutrinos.\n\n", "2307.08842": "2023-07-17, **A view of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering**, M.

We add details for common or interesting characteristics of RSG, such as multi-star system membership, variability, and classification as a runaway. As potential future core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitors, we studied the ability of the catalog to inform the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) coincidence network made to automate pointing, and show that for 3D position estimates made possible by neutrinos, the number of progenitor candidates can be significantly reduced, improving our ability to observe the progenitor pre-explosion and the early phases of the core-collapse supernova.\n\n", "2307.08744": "2023-07-17, **New constraints on the gamma-ray and high energy neutrino fluxes from the circumstellar interaction of SN 2023ixf**, Prantik Sarmah et.al., [2307.08744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08744v1)\n\n The recent supernova, SN 2023ixf, one of the closest observed type II SNe has revealed the presence of a dense circumstellar material (CSM). Interaction of the SN ejecta with this dense CSM may create high energy protons of PeV energies through shock acceleration. These accelerated protons then colliding with the CSM (inelastic $pp$ collision) can produce secondaries such as high energy gamma-rays and neutrinos. However, no gamma-rays and neutrinos have been detected by Fermi-LAT and IceCube from this event. Indeed, Fermi-LAT has placed an upper limits on the gamma-ray flux above $100$~MeV to be $2.6 \\times 10^{-11}~\\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$. On the other hand IceCube's upper limit on muon neutrino flux is $7.3\\times 10^{-2} ~\\rm GeV~cm^{-2}$.

The minimal extension of the SM that can avoid this instability while leaving the SM Higgs as the sole scalar particle of the theory is obtained by adding suitable fermions to the SM. These fermions are good dark matter candidates and the model is known as the minimal dark matter model. We revisit the inflationary scenario based on the minimal dark matter model, taking into account updated parameter constraints and recent understanding of reheating dynamics.

Rappaz et.al., [2307.09451v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09451v1)\n\n The intracluster medium (ICM) is the low-density diffuse magnetized plasma in galaxy clusters, which reaches virial temperatures of up to 10^8 K. Under these conditions, the plasma is weakly collisional and therefore has an anisotropic pressure tensor with respect to the local direction of the magnetic field. This triggers very fast, Larmor-scale, pressure-anisotropy-driven kinetic instabilities that alter magnetic field amplification. We study magnetic field amplification through a turbulent small-scale dynamo, including the effects of the kinetic instabilities, during the evolution of a typical massive galaxy cluster. A specific aim of this work is to establish a redshift limit from which a dynamo has to start to amplify the magnetic field up to equipartition with the turbulent velocity field at redshift z=0. We implemented 1D radial profiles for various plasma quantities for merger trees generated with the Modified GALFORM algorithm. We assume that turbulence is driven by successive mergers of dark matter halos and construct effective models for the Reynolds number Re\\_eff dependence on the magnetic field in three different magnetization regimes, including the effects of kinetic instabilities. The magnetic field growth rate is calculated for the different Re\\_eff models. The model results in a higher magnetic field growth rate at higher redshift. For all scenarios considered, to reach equipartition at z=0, the amplification of the magnetic field has to start at redshift z\\_start=1.5 and above. The time to reach equipartition can be significantly shorter, in cases with systematically smaller turbulent forcing scales, and for the highest Re\\_eff models.

In the axiverse, a hypothetical mass mixing between the QCD axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) can occur, which leads to an interesting phenomenon called the level crossing. In this paper, we investigate this mass mixing between one QCD axion and one ALP with the explicit PQ symmetry breaking in the early Universe. The dynamics of the axions and their cosmological evolutions when the level crossing occurs in this scenario are studied in detail. Then we focus our attention on the axion dark matter (DM) abundance. With several typical parameter sets for level crossing, we find that in the presence of the explicit PQ symmetry breaking term in the mixing, the total axion DM abundance is dominated by ALP and significantly suppressed.\n\n", "2307.09197": "2023-07-18, **Sensitivity of Space-based Gravitational-Wave Interferometers to Ultralight Bosonic Fields and Dark Matter**, Jiang-Chuan Yu et.al., [2307.09197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09197v1)\n\n Ultralight bosonic fields (ULBFs) are predicted by various theories beyond the standard model of particle physics and are viable candidates of cold dark matter.

Gravitational-wave detectors have been very successful in implementing cavities and quantum squeezed light for enhancing sensitivity to signals from black hole or neutron star mergers. However, the sensitivity to weak forces is limited by available energy and optical decoherence in the system. Here, we derive the fundamental sensitivity limit of cavity and squeezed-light enhanced interferometers with optical loss.This limit is attained by the optimal use of an additional internal squeeze operation, which allows to mitigate readout loss. We demonstrate the application of internal squeezing to various scenarios and confirm that it indeed allows to reach the best sensitivity in cavity and squeezed-light enhanced linear force sensors.

This was found to be inconsistent with the standard model of cosmology based on comparisons to semi-analytical dark matter-only simulations, where no such correlation was found. In this work, we extend these studies using the volume-complete ELVES dwarf galaxy catalog, which increases the number of systems compared to previous work by a factor of four. For each giant galaxy we compile the bulge-to-total baryonic mass (B/T) ratio and put it as a function of the number of dwarf galaxies surrounding them within 250 kpc (N$\\_{250}$). For the 29 galaxy systems in the ELVES catalog, we find a linear relation between B/T and N$\\_{250}$ which is consistent with previous data. However, for a given stellar mass of the host galaxy this relation is mainly driven by their morphology, where early-type galaxies have a larger B/T ratio and a larger N$\\_{250}$ than late type galaxies. By investigating spiral galaxies in Illustris-TNG100, we tested whether the inclusion of baryons in the simulations will change the results based on Millennium-II.

We find that the dark matter density of ENSs of most spherical cold collapses ha a markedly cored structure, in particular for the lowest values of the initial virial ratios. End states of some simulations with clumpy initial conditions have more complex profiles and some of their ENSs exhibit a moderate cusp, with logarithmic density slope always shallower than 1.

These neutral particles are often assumed to have vanishing electric and magnetic dipole moments so that they do not interact with single real photons, but the anapole moment can still be nonzero, permitting interactions with single virtual photons. This anapole moment allows for p-wave annihilation of DM into standard model particles, and the DM interacts with external electric currents via the anapole moment. Moving beyond their static electromagnetic properties, these particles generically have non-zero polarizabilities which mediate interactions with two real photons; in particular, spin-dependent polarizibilities admit s-wave annihilation of the DM into two photons. When the Universe cools from a temperature on the order of the DM mass to freeze out, the DM is in thermal equilibrium with the background plasma of particles, but the comoving DM density decreases due to annihilation. If a collection of initially unpolarized DM particles were subjected to an electric current, then the DM medium would become partially polarized, according to the Boltzmann distribution, with a slight excess of anapole moments aligned with the current, relative to those anti-aligned. For this region of partially polarized DM particles, the s-wave annihilation mode becomes partially suppressed because it requires a state of vanishing angular momentum. As a consequence, the decreased DM annihilation rate in this region will result in an excess of DM density, relative to an unpolarized region, as DM drops out of thermal equilibrium.

Moreover, its presence in strongly asymmetric matter may increase considerably the proton and the $\\alpha$-particle fractions. This may have an influence on the dissolution of the accretion disk of the merger of two neutron stars.\n\n", "2307.08967": "2023-07-18, **New estimation of the nuclear de-excitation line emission from the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A**, Bing Liu et.al., [2307.08967v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08967v1)\n\n MeV nuclear de-excitation lines serve as a unique tool to study low-energy cosmic rays (CRs), containing both spectral and elemental information of the interacting material. In this paper, we estimated the possible nuclear de-excitation lines from the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. Given different CR spectral shapes and interacting materials, we found the predicted fluxes of strong narrow line emissions from the remnant are highly model-dependent, ranging from about $1\\times10^{-10}\\,{\\rm \\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$ to $1\\times10^{-6}\\, {\\rm \\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$ for the 4.44 MeV narrow line and from about $4\\times10^{-11}\\,{\\rm \\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$ to $2\\times10^{-7}{\\rm \\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$ for the 6.13 MeV narrow line, respectively. Based on the new estimation, we also discussed the detection probability of these line emissions against the MeV diffuse Galactic background under different assumptions of instrument response functions.\n\n", "2307.08746": "2023-07-17, **Unravelling the structure of magnetised molecular clouds with SILCC-Zoom: sheets, filaments and fragmentation**, S. Ganguly et.al., [2307.08746v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08746v1)\n\n To what extent magnetic fields affect how molecular clouds (MCs) fragment and create dense structures is an open question. We present a numerical study of cloud fragmentation using the SILCC-Zoom simulations. These simulations follow the self-consistent formation of MCs in a few hundred parsec sized region of a stratified galactic disc; and include magnetic fields, self-gravity, supernova-driven turbulence, as well as a non-equilibrium chemical network. To discern the role of magnetic fields in the evolution of MCs, we study seven simulated clouds, five with magnetic fields, and two without, with a maximum resolution of 0.1 parsec. Using a dendrogram we identify hierarchical structures which form within the clouds. Overall, the magnetised clouds have more mass in a diffuse envelope with a number density between 1-100 cm$^{-3}$. We find that six out of seven clouds are sheet-like on the largest scales, as also found in recent observations, and with filamentary structures embedded within, consistent with the bubble-driven MC formation mechanism. Hydrodynamic simulations tend to produce more sheet-like structures also on smaller scales, while the presence of magnetic fields promotes filament formation. Analysing cloud energetics, we find that magnetic fields are dynamically important for less dense, mostly but not exclusively atomic structures (typically up to $\\sim 100 - 1000$~cm$^{-3}$), while the denser, potentially star-forming structures are energetically dominated by self-gravity and turbulence. In addition, we compute the magnetic surface term and demonstrate that it is generally confining, and some atomic structures are even magnetically held together. In general, magnetic fields delay the cloud evolution and fragmentation by $\\sim$ 1 Myr.\n\n", "2307.08660": "2023-07-17, **Helium as a signature of the double detonation in Type Ia supernovae**, Christine E. Collins et.al., [2307.08660v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08660v1)\n\n The double detonation is a widely discussed mechanism to explain Type Ia supernovae from explosions of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. In this scenario, a helium detonation is ignited in a surface helium shell on a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, which leads to a secondary carbon detonation. Explosion simulations predict high abundances of unburnt helium in the ejecta, however, radiative transfer simulations have not been able to fully address whether helium spectral features would form. This is because helium can not be sufficiently excited to form spectral features by thermal processes, but can be excited by collisions with non-thermal electrons, which most studies have neglected. We carry out a full non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer simulation for an instance of a double detonation explosion model, and include a non-thermal treatment of fast electrons. We find a clear He I {\\lambda} 10830 feature which is strongest in the first few days after explosion and becomes weaker with time. Initially this feature is blended with the Mg II {\\lambda} 10927 feature but over time separates to form a secondary feature to the blue wing of the Mg II {\\lambda} 10927 feature. We compare our simulation to observations of iPTF13ebh, which showed a similar feature to the blue wing of the Mg II {\\lambda} 10927 feature, previously identified as C I. Our simulation shows a good match to the evolution of this feature and we identify it as high velocity He I {\\lambda} 10830. This suggests that He I {\\lambda} 10830 could be a signature of the double detonation scenario.\n\n", "2307.08656": "2023-07-17, **XMM-Newton observations of the TeV-discovered supernova remnant HESS J1534-571**, N. T. Nguyen-Dang et.al., [2307.08656v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08656v1)\n\n We report the results obtained from XMM-Newton observations of the TeV-detected supernova remnant (SNR) HESS J1534-571. We focus on the nature of the cosmic-ray particle content in the SNR, which is revealed by its $\\gamma$-ray emission. No signatures of X-ray synchrotron emission were detected from the SNR. This is consistent with earlier results obtained with Suzaku from other regions of the object. A joint modeling of the XMM-Newton and Suzaku spectra yields an upper limit for the total X-ray flux from the SNR area of $\\sim$ 5.62$ \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{erg\\ cm^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$ (95% c.l.) in the energy band of 2-10 keV, for an assumed photon index of 2.0. On the other hand, we do find evidence in the XMM-Newton data for a line-like emission feature at 6.4 keV from localized regions, again confirming earlier Suzaku measurements. We discuss the findings in the context of the origin of the observed $\\gamma$-ray emission. Although neither hadronic nor leptonic scenarios can be fully ruled out, the observed line emission can be interpreted as the result of interactions between lower energy ($\\sim$ MeV) cosmic-ray protons with high gas density regions in and around HESS J1534-571, and thus potentially be associated with particles accelerated in the SNR.\n\n", "2307.08584": "2023-07-17, **Using spectral modeling to break light-curve degeneracies of type II supernovae interacting with circumstellar material**, Luc Dessart et.al., [2307.08584v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08584v1)\n\n A large fraction of red-supergiant stars seem to be enshrouded by circumstellar material (CSM) at the time of explosion. Relative to explosions in a vacuum, this CSM causes both a luminosity boost at early times as well as the presence of symmetric emission lines with a narrow core and electron-scattering wings typical of type IIn supernovae (SNe). For this study, we performed radiation-hydrodynamics and radiative transfer calculations for a variety of CSM configurations (i.e., compact, extended, and detached) and documented the resulting ejecta and radiation properties. We find that models with a dense, compact, and massive CSM of ~0.5Msun can match the early luminosity boost of type II-P SNe but fail to produce type IIn-like spectral signatures (aka ``flash features''). These only arise if the photon mean free path in the CSM is large enough (i.e, if the density is low enough) to allow for a radiative precursor through a long-lived (i.e., a day to a week), radially extended unshocked optically thick CSM. The greater radiative losses and kinetic-energy extraction in this case boost the luminosity even for modest CSM masses -- this boost is delayed for a detached CSM. The inadequate assumption of high CSM density, in which the shock travels quasi adiabatically, overestimates the CSM mass and associated mass-loss rate. Our simulations also indicate that type IIn-like spectral signatures last as long as there is optically-thick unshocked CSM. Constraining the CSM structure therefore requires a combination of light curves and spectra, rather than photometry alone. We emphasize that for a given total energy, the radiation excess fostered by the presence of CSM comes at the expense of kinetic energy, as evidenced by the disappearance of the fastest ejecta material and the accumulation of mass in a dense shell. Both effects can be constrained from spectra well after the interaction phase.\n\n", "2307.08285": "2023-07-17, **A Measurement of Hubble Constant Using Cosmographic Approach from Fast Radio Bursts and SNe Ia**, Jiaze Gao et.al., [2307.08285v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08285v1)\n\n The Hubble constant ${H}\\_0$ is a crucial parameter in cosmology. However, different cosmic observations have resulted in varying posterior results for ${H}\\_0$, leading to what is known as the ${H}\\_0$ tension. In order to address this issue, it is beneficial to use other dataset to constrain ${H}\\_0$.

Then we find that the uncertainty in $H\\_0$ is not significantly affected by the prior range of $f\\_{\\rm{IGM}}(z)$ and $\\Omega\\_{\\rm{b,0}}$, but the mean value is influenced by the priors for $f\\_{\\rm{IGM}}(z)$ and $\\Omega\\_{\\rm{b,0}}$ due to parameter degeneracies with $H\\_0$. Employing $f\\_{\\rm{IGM}}(z)$ that evolves with redshift, we obtain the constraints for $H\\_0=69.0^{+6.7}\\_{-5.7}$ ${\\rm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$. Furthermore, the mock analyses give a posterior estimation of $H\\_0$ with an accuracy of 4.6\\% and higher precision for $q\\_0$ and $j\\_0$ in the near future.\n\n"}}
