Mumpower et.al., [2411.11831v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11831v1)\n\n We propose that neutrons may be generated in high-energy, high-flux photon environments via photo-induced reactions on pre-existing baryons. These photo-hadronic interactions are expected to occur in astrophysical jets and surrounding material. Historically, these reactions have been attributed to the production of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We estimate the photoproduction off of protons in the context of gamma-ray bursts, where it is expected there will be sufficient baryonic material that may be encompassing or entrained in the jet. We show that typical stellar baryonic material, even material completely devoid of neutrons, can become inundated with neutrons in situ via hadronic photoproduction. Consequently, this mechanism provides a means for collapsars and other astrophysical sites containing substantial flux of high-energy photons to be favorable for neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.\n\n", "2411.11804": "2024-11-18, **Novel Application of Neutrinos to Evaluate U.S. Nuclear Weapons Performance**, J.

Robust estimates demonstrate that an Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) neutrino scintillation detector built at the Nevada Test Site of 1000-ton active target mass at a standoff distance of 500 m would detect thousands of neutrino events per kTe of nuclear yield. This would provide less than 4% statistical error on measured neutrino rate and 5% error on neutrino energy. Extrapolating this to an error on the test device explosive yield requires knowledge from evaluated nuclear databases, non-equilibrium fission rates, and assumptions on internal neutron fluxes. Initial calculations demonstrate that prompt neutrino rates from a short pulse of Pu-239 fission is about a factor of two less than that from a steady state assumption. As well, there are significant energy spectral differences as a function of time after the pulse that needs to be considered. In the absence of nuclear weapons testing, many of the technical and theoretical challenges of a full nuclear test could be mitigated with a low cost smaller scale 20 ton fiducial mass IBD demonstration detector placed near a TRIGA pulsed reactor. The short duty cycle and repeatability of pulses would provide critical real environment testing and the measured neutrino rate as a function of time data would provide unique constraints on fission databases and equilibrium assumptions.\n\n", "2411.11749": "2024-11-18, **Bounds on new neutrino interactions from the first CE$\u03bd$NS data at direct detection experiments**, Valentina De Romeri et.al., [2411.11749v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11749v1)\n\n Recently, two dark matter direct detection experiments have announced the first indications of nuclear recoils from solar $^8$B neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\\nu$NS) with xenon nuclei. These results constitute a turning point, not only for dark matter searches that are now entering the \\textit{neutrino fog}, but they also bring out new opportunities to exploit dark matter facilities as neutrino detectors. We investigate the implications of recent data from the PandaX-4T and XENONnT experiments on both Standard Model physics and new neutrino interactions. We first extract information on the weak mixing angle at low momentum transfer. Then, following a phenomenological approach, we consider Lorentz-invariant interactions (scalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor) between neutrinos, quarks and charged leptons. Furthermore, we study the $U(1)\\_\\mathrm{B-L}$ scenario as a concrete example of a new anomaly-free vector interaction. We find that despite the low statistics of these first experimental results, the inferred bounds are in some cases already competitive. For the scope of this work we also compute new bounds on some of the interactions using CE$\\nu$NS data from COHERENT and electron recoil data from XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, PandaX-4T, and TEXONO. It seems clear that while direct detection experiments continue to take data, more precise measurements will be available, thus allowing to test new neutrino interactions at the same level or even improving over dedicated neutrino facilities.\n\n", "2411.11523": "2024-11-18, **New multinucleon knockout model in NuWro Monte Carlo generator**, Hemant Prasad et.al., [2411.11523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11523v1)\n\n We present the implementation and results of a new model for the n-particle n-hole ($\\it{np-nh}$) contribution in the NuWro event generator, grounded in the theoretical framework established by the Valencia group in 2020.

The light neutrino masses and mixings are generated radiatively while maintaining consistency with bounds on lepton flavor violation.

However, compared to Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), very little is known about the connection of ELGs with the underlying matter field. In this paper, we employ a novel theoretical model, SHAMe-SF, to infer the connection between ELGs and their host dark matter subhaloes. SHAMe-SF is a version of subhalo abundance matching that incorporates prescriptions for multiple processes, including star formation, tidal stripping, environmental correlations, and quenching. We analyse the public measurements of the projected and redshift-space ELGs correlation functions at $z=1.0$ and $z=1.3$ from DESI One Percent data release, which we fit over a broad range of scales $r \\in [0.1, 30]/h^{-1}$Mpc to within the statistical uncertainties of the data.

Earlier studies have established viability of the lightest scalar glueball as a possible DM candidate. In this work, we explore a whole class of effective composite sectors in the confined Yang-Mills regime featuring an additional pseudoscalar glueball state. We also investigate the role of effective interactions of the dark glueball sector with the visible sectors via higher-dimensional operators primarily focusing on dimension-8 couplings of glueballs to photons and gluons. We stress the remarkable similarities between the phenomenology of such glueball effective theories and Standard Model extensions featuring Axion-Like Particles (ALPs). Hence, one deals with a new class of composite Glueball ALPs (or GALPs) coupled to photons and/or nucleons in a wide mass range, from sub-eV to the Planck scale, yielding viable DM candidates that can be probed by astrophysical and cosmological observations.\n\n", "2411.11680": "2024-11-18, **Observational features of the rotating Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter**, Ke-Jian He et.al., [2411.11680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11680v1)\n\n By employing ray-tracing techniques, we investigate the shadow images of rotating Bardeen black holes surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. In this work, two models are considered for the background light source, namely the celestial light source model and the thin accretion disk model. Regarding the celestial light source, the investigation focuses on the impact of variations in relevant parameters and observed inclination on the contour and size of the shadow. For the thin accretion disk model, the optical appearance of a black hole is evidently contingent upon the radiative properties exhibited by the accretion disk, as well as factors such as observed inclination and relevant parameters governing spacetime. With an increasing observation inclination, the observed flux of direct and lensed images of the accretion disk gradually converge towards the lower region of the image, while an increase in the dark matter parameter $a$ significantly expands the region encompassing both direct and lensed images. Furthermore, the predominant effect is redshift at lower observation angles, whereas the blueshift effect only becomes apparent at higher observation angles. Simultaneously, the increase in the observation inclination will amplify the redshift effect, whereas an increase in the magnetic charge $\\mathcal{G}$, rotation parameter $a$ and the absolute value of dark matter parameter $\\alpha$ will attenuate the redshift effect observed in the image.

Interpreted as dust attenuated AGN, their inferred intrinsic luminosities and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses rival those of UV-luminous quasars, although they are $>100$ times more abundant. If LRDs and quasars are members of the same underlying population, they should inhabit comparable mass dark matter halos, traced by similar overdensities of galaxies. Otherwise, they represent distinct populations with different physical properties and formation histories. Characterizing LRD environments thus provides a critical test of their nature. Here, we report the discovery of a LRD at $z=7.3$, attenuated by moderate amounts of dust, $A\\_V = {3.26}\\,\\rm{mag}$, with an intrinsic bolometric luminosity of $10^{46.7}\\,\\rm{erg}\\,\\rm{s}^{-1}$ and a SMBH mass of $7\\times10^8\\,\\rm{M}\\_\\odot$.

Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between halo spin and the HI-to-stellar mass ratio in both low-mass and massive galaxy samples.

By comparing and testing various properties, we demonstrate that the reconstructed velocity field is in good agreement with the actual situation.

The $\\alpha$-elements are primarily produced via core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) which should result in $\\alpha$-element abundance ratios that do not vary significantly across cosmic time. However, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) models predict an excess production of Ar relative to O and Ne. The Ar/O abundance ratio can therefore be used as a tracer of the relative enrichment of CCSNe and SNe Ia in galaxies. Our sample approximately doubles the number of sources with measurements of ${\\rm Ar/O}$ at $z > 2$, and we find that our sample exhibits sub-solar Ar/O ratios on average, with $\\rm{Ar/O} = 0.62 \\pm 0.10 \\, (\\rm{Ar/O})\\_{\\odot}$.

First, we show that such evidence is present at the 3$\\sigma$ level, even without the new BAO data from the dark energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), by instead using BAO data from the dark energy Survey (DES), combined with the DES5Y supernovae and Planck CMB data. Next, we examine the role of the DES5Y supernova dataset, showing that the preference for time-varying dark energy is driven by the low redshift supernovae common to both the DES5Y and Pantheon+ compilations. We find that combining Pantheon+ and DES5Y supernovae by removing the common supernovae leads to two different results, depending on whether they are removed from the DES5Y or the Pantheon+ catalog, leading to stronger or weaker exclusion of $\\Lambda$CDM, at the (3.8$\\sigma$) and (2.5$\\sigma$) level, respectively. These common supernovae have smaller error bars in DES5Y compared to Pantheon+, and, as recently pointed out, there is an offset in magnitude in DES5Y between supernovae at ($z > 0.1$), where almost all the measurements taken during the full five years of DES are, and the low-redshift ones ($z < 0.1$), where all the historical set of nearby supernovae lies.

Even for modern models that invoke relatively small He shell masses, many previous studies have found that the products of the helium shell detonation lead to discrepancies with normal Type Ia supernovae, such as strong Ti II absorption features, extremely red light curves and too large a variation with viewing direction. It has been suggested that non local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects may help to reduce these discrepancies with observations. Here we carry out full non-LTE radiative transfer simulations for a recent double detonation model with a relatively small helium shell mass of 0.05 M$\\_\\odot$. We construct 1D models representative of directions in a 3D explosion model to give an indication of viewing angle dependence. The full non-LTE treatment leads to improved agreement between the models and observations. The light curves become less red, due to reduced absorption by the helium shell detonation products, since these species are more highly ionised. Additionally, the expected variation with observer direction is reduced.

Using advanced radiative transfer simulations with the new, open-source SuperLite code to generate synthetic spectra, we identify key spectroscopic indicators of CSM characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that spectral lines of hydrogen and helium exhibit significant variations due to differences in CSM mass and composition. In hydrogen-rich SLSN- II, we observe pronounced hydrogen emission lines that correlate strongly with dense, extended CSM, suggesting massive, eruptive mass-loss histories. Conversely, in hydrogen-poor SLSNe, we recover mostly featureless spectra at early times, with weak hydrogen lines appearing only in the very early phases of the explosion, highlighting the quick ionization of traces of hydrogen present in the CSM.

A large population of `ordinary' Ic-BLs for which no GRB component is detected also exists. On average, the expansion velocities of GRB-associated Ic-BLs exceed those of ordinary Ic-BLs. This work presents the largest spectroscopic sample of Ic-BL SNe with and without GRBs to date. The goal of this work is to investigate how the expansion velocities evolve in cases where an ultra-relativistic jet has been launched (GRB-SN cases) and compare these to Ic-BL SNe without a GRB detection. We measured the expansion velocities of the Fe II, Si II and Ca II lines observed in the spectra of Ic-BL SNe using a spline fitting method. We fit the expansion velocity evolution with single and broken power-laws. The expansion velocities of the Fe II and Si II features reveal considerable overlap between the two populations. It is not clear that GRB-associated supernovae expand more rapidly. Broken power-law evolution appears to be more common for the Si II feature, which always follows a shallow-steep decay, while the broken power-law Fe II decays are predominantly steep-shallow. The power-law indices for both samples were compared for both Fe II and Si II, and suggest that GRB-SNe decline at a similar rate to non-GRB Ic-BL supernovae. Neither the velocities nor their evolution can be used to distinguish between Ic-BLs with and without GRBs. Expansion velocities consistent with broken power-law evolution may indicate the presence of two velocity components, which may be evidence for a jet in some of these explosions. However, it is not possible to rule in or out the presence of a jet in any Ic-BL supernova purely based on the velocities.

I compare $\\omega$Cen/GSE with other central BH hosts and place it within the broader context of BH-galaxy (co)evolution. The IMBH of $\\omega$Cen/GSE follows the scaling relation between central BH mass and host stellar mass (${\\rm M}\\_{\\rm BH}{-}{\\rm M}\\_\\star$) extrapolated from local massive galaxies (${\\rm M}\\_\\star \\gtrsim 10^{10}\\,{\\rm M}\\_\\odot$).
