We present a detailed numerical study of PBH formation during the QCD epoch in order to derive an accurate PBH mass function. We also briefly consider PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch. Our investigation confirms that, for nearly scale-invariant spectra, PBH abundances on the QCD scale are enhanced by a factor $\\sim 10^3$ compared to a purely radiation dominated Universe. For a power spectrum producing an (almost) scale-invariant PBH mass function outside of the transition, we find a peak mass of $M\\_{\\rm pbh}\\approx 1.9 M\\_{\\odot}$ of which a fraction $f\\approx 1.5\\times 10^{-2}$ of the PBHs have a mass of $M\\_{\\rm pbh} > 10 M\\_{\\odot}$, possibly contributing to the LIGO-Virgo black hole merger detections.

The axions form coherent clouds which delay and amplify gravitational waves (GWs) at a resonant frequency. That is, the coherent axion clouds produce secondary GWs following a primary wave. All GWs from compact binary mergers detected so far propagate in the Milky Way halo composed of dark matter so that such GWs are followed by the secondary GWs. Since the properties of the secondary GWs depend on the axion mass and coupling with the parity violating sector of gravity, we can search for a characteristic signal produced by axions. In our previous study, we have developed a search method optimized for the axion signals, and obtained about ten times stronger constraint on the coupling than the previous best one for the axion mass range, $[1.7 \\times 10^{-13},\\,8.5 \\times 10^{-12}]\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.

We assess the performance of the models using various summary statistics, such as the probability distribution function (PDF) of the pixel values and 2D power spectrum ($P(k)$). Results suggest that in all setups, the model is capable of predicting the target field from the source field and vice versa, and the predicted maps exhibit statistical properties which are consistent with those of the target maps. This is indicated by the fact that the mean and standard deviation of the PDF of maps from the test set is in good agreement with those of the generated maps. The mean and variance of $P(k)$ of the real maps agree well with those of generated ones. The consistency tests on the model suggest that the source field can be recovered reasonably well by a forward mapping (source to target) followed by a backward mapping (target to source).

From the light curve (LC) modeling applied to SNe 2021ckj, 2019hgp, and 2021csp, we find that the ejecta and CSM properties of Type Icn SNe are diverse. SNe 2021ckj and 2021csp likely have two ejecta components (an aspherical high-energy component and a spherical standard-energy component) with a roughly spherical CSM, while SN 2019hgp can be explained by a spherical ejecta-CSM interaction alone. The ejecta of SNe 2021ckj and 2021csp have larger energy per ejecta mass than the ejecta of SN 2019hgp. The density distribution of the CSM is similar in these three SNe, and is comparable to those of Type Ibn SNe. This may imply that the mass-loss mechanism is common between Type Icn (and also Type Ibn) SNe. The CSM masses of SN 2021ckj and SN 2021csp are higher than that of SN 2019hgp, although all these values are within the diversity seen in Type Ibn SNe. The early spectrum of SN 2021ckj shows narrow emission lines from C II and C III, without a clear absorption component, in contrast with that observed in SN 2021csp. The similarity of the emission components of these lines implies that the emitting regions of SNe 2021ckj and 2021csp have similar ionization states, and thus suggests that they have similar properties of the ejecta and CSM, which is inferred also from the LC modeling.

Its properties, and in particular those of the excess, do not easily fit into the well established classification scheme of GRBs as being long or short, leaving the nature of its progenitor uncertain. We present multi-wavelength observations of the GRB and its counterpart, observed up to 160 days after the burst. In order to decipher the nature of the progenitor system, we present a detailed analysis of the GRB high-energy properties (duration, spectral lag, and Amati correlation), its environment, and late-time optical excess. We discuss three possible scenarios: a neutron star merger, a collapsing massive star, and an atypical explosion possibly hosted in a cluster of galaxies. We find that traditional kilonova and supernova models do not match well the properties of the optical excess, leaving us with the intriguing suggestion that this event was an exotic high-energy merger.\n\n", "2303.06866": "2023-03-13, **Using the Star Forming Main Sequence To Explore Quiescent Galaxies Across Cosmic Time**, Tyler Houston et.al., [2303.06866v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06866v1)\n\n In this letter, we explore the quiescent lives of central galaxies using the SAGE galaxy model and Uchuu dark matter simulation. We ask three questions: (1) How much of a galaxy's life is spent in quiescence? (2) How often do galaxies transition off the main sequence? (3) What is the typical duration of a quiescent phase? We find low and high-mass galaxies spend the highest fraction of their lives in quiescence: 45 \\pm 19% for log10(Mstar) < 9.0 (3.68 \\pm 1.80 Gyr) and 26 \\pm 25% for log10(Mstar) > 11.5 (3.46 \\pm 3.30 Gyr), falling to 7 \\pm 13% for galaxies in-between (0.82 \\pm 1.57 Gyr). Low mass galaxies move in and out of quiescence frequently, 2.8 \\pm 1.3 times on average, though only for short periods, 1.49 \\pm 1.04 Gyr. This can be traced to the influence of supernova feedback on their quite stochastic evolution. Galaxies of higher mass have fewer quiescent periods, ~0.7 \\pm 0.9, and their length increases with mass, peaking at 1.97 \\pm 2.27 Gyr. However, our high-mass population comprises star-forming and quiescent galaxies with diverging evolutionary paths, so the actual time may be even longer. These high-mass trends are driven by radio mode feedback from supermassive black holes, which, once active, tend to remain active for extended periods.\n\n"}}
