We focus on the discovery limit, a statistical concept to identify the neutrino floor, and analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the profile binned likelihood ratio test statistic where the likelihood is constructed by variate from events in each bin and pull terms from neutrino fluxes. To achieve the asymptotic result, we propose two novel methods: i) Asymptotic-Analytic method, which furnishes the analytic result for large statistics, is applicable for more extra nuisance parameters, and enables the identification of the most relevant parameters in the statistical analysis; ii) Quasi-Asimov dataset, which is analogous to Asimov dataset but with improved speed. Applying our methods to the neutrino floor, we significantly accelerate the computation procedure compared to the previous literature, and successfully address cases where Asimov dataset fails. Our derivation on the asymptotic behavior of the test statistic not only facilitates research into the impact of neutrinos on the search for dark matter, but may also prove relevant in similar application scenarios.\n\n", "2304.13546": "2023-04-26, **Linking Resonant leptogenesis with dynamics of the inverse seesaw theory with $ A_{4} $ flavor symmetry**, Maibam Ricky Devi et.al., [2304.13546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13546v1)\n\n In this paper, we analyse resonant leptogenesis in a low scale inverse seesaw model with $A\\_4$ flavor symmetry, in a model we explored earlier to explain light neutrino masses and mixings, and also charged lepton flavor violating decay $\\mu\\rightarrow e\\gamma$.

The mechanism is operative in a quantum field theoretical framework, justifying nevertheless a formal analogy with quantum mechanical two- (or more) level systems and their oscillatory behaviour. Both the flavour states and the massive states are eigenstates of certain Hamiltonians which, in special conditions, can be argued to share the same Hilbert space. In this scheme, flavour neutrinos are massless and play the role of asymptotic states for any interactions, including the weak interactions, while massive neutrinos are effective propagation states. The vacuum is interpreted as a medium, where the flavour neutrinos undergo coherent forward scatterings which modify their energy and mix their flavour. The treatment of matter conversion and MSW effect fits in naturally; the extension to other neutral particle oscillations, like $K\\_0-\\bar K\\_0$, is straightforward.

Our results also show that the sensitivity of T2HK gets affected by the systematic uncertainties for the smaller supernova distances. Further, we show that in both DUNE and T2HK, the sensitivity gets deteriorated to some extent due to presence of energy smearing of the neutrino events.

It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N\\_{\\rm RS})$ of ''reionization snapshot'', each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N\\_{\\rm RS}$.

The coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive dark photon, a promising dark matter candidate. The dark photon is predicted to generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process. This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive dark matter particle. This study builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the dark photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact object is determined with approximations on the backreaction effect of the cloud on the compact object. The end result is the projection that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the dark photon mass using extreme mass ratio inspirals in the range $[1.8 \\times 10^{-17}, 4.47 \\times 10^{-16}]$ eV.\n\n", "2304.14052": "2023-04-27, **The resonant probing spin-0 and spin-2 dark matter mediators with fixed target experiments**, I.

The presence of these galaxies appears at odds with the current $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $\\rho\\_*(>M\\_*)$ at the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $\\epsilon\\_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to $2\\sigma$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring the observed stellar mass density at $z \\sim 7 - 10$ to the $2\\sigma$ range of the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M\\_{\\rm halo} > 10^{13} h^{-1}M\\_\\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M\\_{\\rm halo} \\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M\\_\\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\\sim 8$.

These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host halo properties -- concentration ($c\\_{\\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($\\lambda\\_{\\rm Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c\\_{\\rm{NFW}}$ is enhanced by $\\approx 38 \\pm 12\\%$ and $\\approx 88 \\pm 7.7\\%$ for Milky Way mass ($10^{12.1}\\,\\text{M}\\_\\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\\,\\text{M}\\_\\odot$) haloes respectively, (2) $\\lambda\\_{\\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass by $\\approx 16 \\pm 6.8\\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\\approx 32 \\pm 8.9\\%$. Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by $\\approx 12 \\pm 4\\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\\approx 1.2 \\pm 5.6\\%$. The fractional change of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of dark matter haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including subhaloes.\n\n", "2304.13745": "2023-04-26, **Large-scale clustering of buried X-ray AGN: Trends in AGN obscuration and redshift evolution**, Akke Viitanen et.al., [2304.13745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13745v1)\n\n In order to test active galactic nucleus (AGN) unification and evolutionary models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N\\_{\\rm H}$. In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N\\_{\\rm H} < 10^{22}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \\leq N\\_{\\rm H} < 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N\\_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w\\_{\\rm p}(r\\_{\\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N\\_{\\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host dark matter halo, $M\\_{\\rm halo}(z, N\\_{\\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N\\_{\\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass $\\log M\\_{\\rm halo} = 12.98\\_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M\\_\\odot]$ ($12.28\\_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \\sim 0.7$ (high $z \\sim 1.8$) redshifts. We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.\n\n", "2304.14258": "2023-04-26, **Rotating Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter as a particle accelerator**, Qi-Quan Li et.al., [2304.14258v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14258v1)\n\n We study the event horizon of a rotating Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter and the black hole as a particle accelerator. The black hole is represented by four parameters: mass $M$, rotation parameter $a$, dark matter parameter $\\alpha$ and magnetic charge $g$. It is interesting that when we determine the values of magnetic charge $g$ and dark matter parameters $\\alpha$ we can get a critical rotation parameter $a\\_E$ and then we get a contour plane with $\\Delta$= 0 taking three parameters as coordinates. We also derive the effective potential of the particle and the centre-of-mass (CM) energy of the two particles outside the black hole by using the motion equation of the particle in the equatorial plane of the black hole. We find that the CM energy depends not only on the rotation parameter $a$, but also on the parameters $g$ and $\\alpha$. We discuss the CM energy for two particles colliding at the black hole horizon in the extreme and non-extreme cases, respectively. It is found that the CM energy can be arbitrarily high when the angular momentum of one of the two particles is the critical angular momentum under the background of extreme black holes and there is no such result for non-extreme black holes, because the particles do not reach the black hole horizon when the angular momentum of the particles is critical angular momentum. Therefore, we prove that the rotating Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter can be used as a particle accelerator.\n\n", "2304.13585": "2023-04-26, **Merging galaxy clusters in IllustrisTNG**, Ewa L.

Some of the mergers show a spectacular bow shock that formed as a result of recent passage of a smaller cluster through a bigger one, the classic example of this being the so-called bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4 \\times 10^{14}$ M$\\_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses most of its dark matter and gas in the process. The displacement between the collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such as A520 and Coma.\n\n", "2304.13576": "2023-04-26, **Stochastic gravitational-wave background at 3G detectors as a smoking gun for microscopic dark matter relics**, G.

We consider the Higgs triplet to be odd under the $Z\\_2$ symmetry, and hence the lightest stable particle from the inert triplet becomes the dark matter candidate, whereas the real singlet is considered to be even under the $Z\\_2$ symmetry. A dimension-5 effective term is introduced with the help of a real singlet, which breaks the CP symmetry and gives an additional source of CP-violation in the fermion sector. The phase transition proceeds in two-steps, with the symmetry breaking in the singlet direction occurring first and later leading to the usual electroweak symmetry breaking minima, while electroweak baryogenesis is associated with the second step.

We find that comparing with the available experimental exclusion limits dominated by the mediator effect for XENON10, XENON100 and XENON1T, the constraints on the puffy DM-electron scattering cross-section become much weaker for large radius DM particles.

We find the expression to differ significantly from the one commonly used in redshift space. Furthermore, we present a comparison of the number count angular power spectra between luminosity distance and redshift spaces. We see a wide divergence between the two at large scales, and we note that lensing is the main contribution to such differences. On such scales and at higher redshifts the difference between the angular power spectra in luminosity distance and redshift spaces can be roughly 50$\\%$. We also investigate cross-correlating different redshift bins using different tracers, i.e. one in luminosity distance space and one in redshift, simulating the cross-correlation angular power spectrum between background gravitational waves/supernovae and foreground galaxies.

Meanwhile, we divide the 1048 type Ia supernovae (SNIa) of Pantheon into corresponding subsets according to their distribution in the galactic coordinate system.

The derived binary parameters are useful in constraining the evolutionary scenario for the progenitors and the physics of binary interactions. We apply our model to the observed photometry of some known stripped-envelope supernova companions (SN1993J, SN2001ig, SN2006jc, SN2011dh, SN2013ge). Combined with other observational constraints such as the pre-supernova progenitor photometry, we find that SN1993J and SN2011dh likely had relatively massive companions on wide orbits, while SN2006jc may have had a relatively low-mass companion on a tight orbit. This trend suggests that type IIb supernova progenitors evolved from stable mass transfer channels and type Ibc progenitors may have formed from common-envelope channels.

There is also evidence for the presence of much cooler ($\\lesssim2.5\\times10^4$ K) gas. Remarkable changes are seen in the HeI $1.083\\mu$m line, the strength of which declines, then recovers, in anti-correlation with the X-ray behaviour. We conclude that shock ionisation is the dominant excitation mechanism for the coronal line emission. There is evidence in the infrared spectra for the presence of black body emission at $\\sim20000$ K, which we tentatively identify with the irradiated secondary, and for free-free/free-bound emission. For the previously determined binary inclination of $82.7$ degrees, the implied ejection velocities are as high as 22000 km s$^{-1}$. These velocities appear unprecedented in nova outflows, and are comparable to those seen in supernovae, thereby marking U Sco as a truly remarkable object.\n\n"}}
