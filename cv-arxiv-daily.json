We study the consequences in the measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameters namely $\\theta\\_{23}$ and $\\delta\\_{\\rm CP}$ in light of both Large Mixing Angle (LMA) and DLMA solutions of $\\theta\\_{12}$. We find that it will be impossible for IceCube to determine the $\\delta\\_{\\rm CP}$ and the true nature of $\\theta\\_{12}$ i.e., LMA or DLMA at the same time. This is because of the existence of an intrinsic degeneracy at the Hamiltonian level between these parameters. Apart from that, we also identify a new degeneracy between $\\theta\\_{23}$ and two solutions of $\\theta\\_{12}$ for a fixed value of $\\delta\\_{\\rm CP}$. We perform a chi-square fit using three different astrophysical sources, i.e., $\\mu$ source, $\\pi$ source, and $n$ source to find that both $\\mu$ source and $\\pi$ source are allowed within $1 \\sigma$ whereas the $n$ source is excluded at $2 \\sigma$. It is difficult to make any conclusion regarding the measurement of $\\theta\\_{23}$, $\\delta\\_{\\rm CP}$ for $\\mu$ source. However, The $\\pi$ ($n$) source prefers higher (lower) octant of $\\theta\\_{23}$ for both LMA and DLMA solution of $\\theta\\_{12}$. The best-fit value of $\\delta\\_{\\rm CP}$ is around $180^\\circ$ ($0^\\circ/360^\\circ$) for LMA (DLMA) solution of $\\theta\\_{12}$ whereas for DLMA (LMA) solution of $\\theta\\_{12}$, the best-fit value is around $0^\\circ/360^\\circ$ ($180^\\circ$) for $\\pi$ ($n$) source.

One promising direction is via the detection of low-energy atmospheric neutrinos (below a few hundred MeV), to which a variety of near-term experiments will have much-improved sensitivity. Here we focus on probing these neutrinos through distinctive nuclear signatures of exclusive neutrino-carbon interactions -- those that lead to detectable nuclear-decay signals with low backgrounds -- in both neutral-current and charged-current channels. Here the neutral-current signature is a line at 15.11 MeV and the charged-current signatures are two- or three-fold coincidences with delayed decays. We calculate the prospects for identifying such events in the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a large-scale liquid-scintillator detector.

The model does not predict, however, the right amount of EDE density because of smallness of neutrino masses. One may hope to adjust the parameters in such a way as to ensure that the two-loop contributions are kept small while at the same time the effective mass for scalar field that enters the expression of zero-point-energy (for the field trapped in the minimum of effective potential) is sufficient for explaining the needed amount of EDE.

These theories are also interesting on theoretical grounds, for example in reference to the approach to the large-N limit. A particularly compelling research aim is the determination of the extent of the conformal window in gauge theories with symplectic groups coupled to matter, for different groups and for field content consisting of fermions transforming in different representations. Such determination would have far-reaching implications, but requires overcoming huge technical challenges.   Numerical studies based on lattice field theory can provide the quantitative information necessary to this endeavour. We developed new software to implement symplectic groups in the Monte Carlo algorithms within the Grid framework. In this paper, we focus most of our attention on the Sp(4) lattice gauge theory coupled to four (Wilson-Dirac) fermions transforming in the 2-index antisymmetric representation, as a case study. We discuss an extensive catalogue of technical tests of the algorithms and present preliminary measurements to set the stage for future large-scale numerical investigations.

In this study, we investigate the detectability of Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDS) by the Roman Space Telescope. RST will be able to detect SMDSs at redshifts as high as $z\\simeq 14$. In cases with gravitational lensing factors of $\\mu\\sim 100$, RST will be able to find SMDS as small as $\\sim10^4 M\\_{\\odot}$ at $z\\sim 12$ with $\\sim 10^6$ s of exposure. To differentiate SMDS from early galaxies containing zero metallicity stars at similar redshifts, we compare their spectra, photometry in RST bands, color indexes and image morphology. With RST alone, the differentiation is possible only for limited cases: SMDS formed via \"adiabatic contraction\" (DM pulled into the star via gravity alone) with $M\\gtrsim 10^5M\\_{\\odot}$ and lensed by $\\mu\\gtrsim 30$ have distinct photometric signatures from those of the first galaxies. For SMDSs formed via \"dark matter capture,\" their spectra are degenerate to those of many galaxies with little to no nebular emission. Thus with RST alone, the only way to tell them apart from first galaxies would be via image morphology: i.e. point object (SMDSs) vs. extended object (sufficiently magnified galaxies). However, if the same objects are further examined by JWST spectroscopy, a \"smoking gun\" for detection of SMDS is the HeII $\\lambda$1640 absorption line. While RST does not cover the wavelength band required to find this line (for $z\\_{\\rm emi}\\gtrsim 10$), JWST does. Hence the two detectors can be used together in identifying SMDS. The confirmed detection of any SMDSs will provide evidence for a new type of star, powered by dark matter.

These interactions affect the internal dynamics of the galaxies. In this thesis, we have studied the effect of flyby interactions and dark matter distributions on the evolution of bulges and disks of spiral galaxies. To understand the effect of flyby interactions on the bulges, disks, and spiral arms of Milky Way mass galaxies, we simulated disk galaxies with classical bulges and boxy/peanut pseudo-bulges, then performed their flyby interactions with 1/10 and 1/5 mass galaxies. Using photometric and kinematic bulge-disk decompositions of the major galaxy, we showed that the disks get shorter and thicker during flyby interactions. Classical bulges remain intact. However, pseudo-bulges become dynamically hotter. Tidally induced spiral arms are transient density waves. They form soon after pericenter passage and decay in two phases; the initial rapid winding and the subsequent slow winding. We showed that the spirals are the main drivers of wave-like vertical breathing motion seen in the Milky Way. Tidal interactions do not directly induce breathing motion. In another work, we showed that the oblate dark matter halos delay bar formation, so bar buckling is also delayed, but probate halos promote multiple bucklings. Due to multiple bucklings, boxy/peanut bulges in prolate halos show the maximum thickness. Using SDSS galaxies, we found that pseudo-bulges are diffuse compared to classical bulges and are commonly found in low mass galaxies. In the local volume, pseudo-bulges overcome the classical bulges even in bulge dominated galaxies, so more than $75\\%$ of local volume is rotation dominated. Finally, we showed that bulgeless galaxies in Illustris TNG50 are metal-poor, have high specific angular momentum as compared to the galaxies with bulges and fall at the lower end of baryonic to dark matter mass ratio.\n\n", "2306.10896": "2023-06-19, **Dilaton-induced open quantum dynamics**, Christian K\u00e4ding et.al., [2306.10896v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10896v1)\n\n In modern cosmology, scalar fields with screening mechanisms are often used as explanations for phenomena like dark energy or dark matter.

Using recently developed path integral tools for directly computing reduced density matrices, we study the open quantum dynamics of a probe, modelled by another real scalar field, induced by interactions with an environment comprising fluctuations of a dilaton. As the leading effect, we extract a correction to the probe's unitary evolution, which can be observed as a frequency shift. Assuming the scalar probe to roughly approximate a cold atom in matter wave interferometry, we show that comparing the predicted frequency shifts in two experimentally distinct setups has the potential to exclude large parts of the dilaton parameter space.\n\n", "2306.10828": "2023-06-19, **Gravitational Wave Probes on Self-Interacting Dark Matter Surrounding an Intermediate Mass Black Hole**, Kenji Kadota et.al., [2306.10828v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10828v1)\n\n The presence of dark matter overdensities surrounding a black hole can influence the evolution of a binary system.

A distinctive characteristic of SIDM surrounding a black hole, as opposed to collisionless dark matter, is the formation of a soliton core.

So far, this model has been difficult to constrain by indirect means. Here we will explore the potential of Omega Centauri, a nearby globular cluster to constrain this interesting DM model. Although such structures are generally considered to be lacking in DM, arguments have been made that this cluster is in fact the relic of a tidally stripped dwarf galaxy. In such a scenario, the DM content would be significant. Combined with its nearness, this would suggest a potential for powerful indirect dark matter signals.

Using Gaia astrometric distance and proper motions, and a radial velocity derived from Gaia spectroscopy, it has been predicted that this star will pass within 1pc of the Solar System in about 30kyr. However, WD0810-353 has been also shown to host a magnetic field with strength of the order of 30MG. Its spectrum is therefore not like those of normal DA stars of similar effective temperature. We have obtained and analysed new polarised spectra of the star around Halpha. Our analysis suggests that the visible surface of the star shows two regions of different field strength (~30 and ~45MG, respectively), and opposite polarity. The spectra do not change over a 4 year time span, meaning that either the stellar rotation period is no shorter than several decades, or that the field is symmetric about the rotation axis. Taking into account magnetic shift and splitting, we obtain an estimate of the radial velocity of the star (+83+/- 140km/s); we reject both the value an the claimed precision deduced from the Gaia DR3 spectroscopy (-373.7+/- 8.2km/s), and we conclude that there will probably be no close encounter between the Solar System and WD0810-353.

The sets are created for three classifications: classic \\hii{} regions, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants. We train a neural network to classify a region as one of the three classes defined above given three key line ratios that are present both in the SITELLE and MUSE instruments' band-passes: [{\\sc O\\,iii}]$\\lambda5007$/H$\\beta$, [{\\sc N\\,ii}]$\\lambda6583$/H$\\alpha$, ([{\\sc S\\,ii}]$\\lambda6717$+[{\\sc S\\,ii}]$\\lambda6731$)/H$\\alpha$.

We compared the $\\gamma$-process overproduction factors from the different models.

The $\\gamma$-process within C-O shell mergers mostly influence the isotopic ratios that involve intermediate and heavy proton-rich isotopes with $\\rm A>100$.\n\n", "2306.11102": "2023-06-19, **CoLFI: Cosmological Likelihood-free Inference with Neural Density Estimators**, Guo-Jian Wang et.al., [2306.11102v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11102v1)\n\n In previous works (Wang et al. 2020, 2022), we proposed to estimate cosmological parameters with the artificial neural network (ANN) and the mixture density network (MDN). In this work, we propose an improved method called the mixture neural network (MNN) to achieve parameter estimation by combining ANN and MDN, which can overcome shortcomings of the ANN and MDN methods. Besides, we propose sampling parameters in a hyper-ellipsoid for the generation of the training set, which makes the parameter estimation more efficient. A high-fidelity posterior distribution can be obtained using $\\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ forward simulation samples. In addition, we develop a code-named ``CoLFI'' for parameter estimation, which incorporates the advantages of MNN, ANN, and MDN, and is suitable for any parameter estimation of complicated models in a wide range of scientific fields. CoLFI provides a more efficient way for parameter estimation, especially for cases where the likelihood function is intractable or cosmological models are complex and resource-consuming. It can learn the conditional probability density $p(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\|\\boldsymbol{d})$ using samples generated by models, and the posterior distribution $p(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\|\\boldsymbol{d}\\_0)$ can be obtained for a given observational data $\\boldsymbol{d}\\_0$. We tested the MNN using power spectra of the cosmic microwave background and Type-Ia supernovae and obtained almost the same result as the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The numerical difference only exists at the level of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}\\sigma)$. The method can be extended to higher dimensional data.\n\n", "2306.11100": "2023-06-19, **Supernova Rates and Luminosity Functions from ASAS-SN I: 2014--2017 Type Ia SNe and Their Sub-Types**, D. D. Desai et.al., [2306.11100v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11100v1)\n\n We present the volumetric rates and luminosity functions (LFs) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the $V$-band All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) catalogues spanning discovery dates from UTC 2014-01-26 to UTC 2017-12-29. Our standard sample consists of 404 SNe Ia with $m\\_{V,\\mathrm{peak}}<17$ mag and Galactic latitude $\\|b\\|>15^{\\circ}$. Our results are both statistically more precise and systematically more robust than previous studies due to the large sample size and high spectroscopic completeness. We make completeness corrections based on both the apparent and absolute magnitudes by simulating the detection of SNe Ia in ASAS-SN light curves. We find a total volumetric rate for all sub-types of $R\\_{\\mathrm{tot}}=2.28^{+0.20}\\_{-0.20}\\,\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\,h^{3}\\_{70}$ for $M\\_{V,\\mathrm{peak}}<-16.5$ mag ($R\\_{\\mathrm{tot}}=1.91^{+0.12}\\_{-0.12}\\,\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\,h^{3}\\_{70}$ for $M\\_{V,\\mathrm{peak}}<-17.5$ mag) at the median redshift of our sample, $z\\_{\\mathrm{med}}=0.024$. This is in agreement ($1\\sigma$) with the local volumetric rates found by previous studies. We also compile luminosity functions (LFs) for the entire sample as well as for sub-types of SNe Ia for the first time.

F. Mayer et.al., [2306.10975v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10975v1)\n\n Aims. Our goal is the characterization of the hot ejecta and shocked interstellar medium (ISM) associated to the Vela supernova remnant (SNR), as well as the relativistic electrons injected into the ambient medium by its central pulsar. To achieve this, we analyze the X-ray data set of Vela acquired by SRG/eROSITA during its first four all-sky surveys. Methods. Apart from multi-band imaging, a quantitative view of the physical parameters affecting the observed thermal and non-thermal emission is obtained by performing spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of over 500 independent regions using multi-component spectral models. Results. Imaging demonstrates that the X-ray emission of the Vela SNR consists of at least three morphologically distinct components, with shell-like structures dominating below 0.6 keV, radial outward-directed features becoming apparent at medium energies, and the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) dominating the hard emission above 1.4 keV. Our spectroscopy reveals a highly structured distribution of X-ray absorption column densities, which intriguingly appears anticorrelated with optical extinction measurements. We find evidence for multiple ejecta clumps inside and outside the shell, within which we find a strongly supersolar concentration of neon and magnesium relative to oxygen. This includes the bright shrapnel D, in which we separate shocked ISM in the soft bow-shock from a hot, ejecta-rich clump at its apex, based on the new data. Finally, we find an extremely extended, smoothly decreasing distribution of synchrotron emission from the PWN, which extends up to 14 pc from the pulsar, with a total X-ray luminosity of $1.5\\times10^{-3}$ of the pulsar's spin-down power. The extended emission likely traces a relativistic electron population in an ISM-level magnetic field, which requires the existence of a TeV counterpart powered by inverse Compton radiation.\n\n"}}
