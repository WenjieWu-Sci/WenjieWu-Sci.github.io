Its detection would simultaneously confirm the hypothesis that neutrinos are Majorana fermions, thus violating lepton-number conservation, and provide the first measurement of the absolute neutrino mass scale. This work aims to improve the estimation within chiral effective field theory of the so-called ``contact term'' for $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$-decay, a short-range two-nucleon effect which is unaccounted for in traditional nuclear approaches to the process. We conduct a thorough review of the justifications for this contact term and the most precise computation of its size to date $g\\_\\nu^{NN}$ = 1.3(6) at renormalisation point $\\mu=m\\_\\pi$), whose precision is limited by a truncation to elastic intermediate hadronic states. We then perform an extension of this analysis to a subleading class of inelastic intermediate states which we characterise, delivering an updated figure for the contact coefficient ($g\\_\\nu^{NN}$ = 1.4(3) at $\\mu=m\\_\\pi$) with uncertainty reduced by half. Such ab initio nuclear results, especially with enhanced precision, show promise for the resolution of disagreements between estimates of $0\\nu\\nu\\beta\\beta$ from different many-body methods.\n\n", "2412.08537": "2024-12-11, **Phenomenology of Neutrino-Dark Matter Interaction in DSNB and AGN**, Po-Yan Tseng et.al., [2412.08537v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08537v1)\n\n We introduce a neutrino-scalar dark matter (DM) $\\nu{\\text{-}}\\phi$ interaction and consider Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) representing distinctive neutrino sources.

Key explanations for pulsar kicks include hydrodynamic instabilities in supernovae, anisotropic neutrino emission, asymmetries in the magnetic field, binary system disruption, and physics beyond the Standard Model.

In this paper, we perform a Fisher forecast to assess the benefit of IA in improving cosmological parameter constraints, for the first time, leveraging the full-shape (FS) information of IA statistics. Our forecast is based on PFS-like and Euclid-like surveys as examples of deep and wide galaxy surveys, respectively. We explore various cosmological models, with the most comprehensive one simultaneously including dynamical dark energy, curvature, massive neutrinos, and modified gravity (MG). We find that adding FS IA information significantly tightens cosmological constraints relative to the FS clustering-only cases, particularly for dynamical dark energy and nonflat-MG models. For a deep galaxy survey, the Figure-of-Merit for the dark energy equation of state parameters is improved by at least more than $40\\%$ in all dynamical dark energy models investigated. For nonflat-MG models, parameter constraints are tightened by $6-28\\%$, except for the dark matter density and spectral index parameters. For a wide galaxy survey, improvements with IA become milder, although its joint constraints are tighter than those from the deep survey.

Kimura et.al., [2412.08136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08136v1)\n\n The origin of PeV cosmic rays is a long-standing mystery, and ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray observations would play a crucial role in identifying it. Recently, LHAASO reported the discovery of ``dark'' gamma-ray sources that were detected above 100 TeV without any GeV--TeV gamma-ray counterparts. The origins of these dark gamma-ray sources are unknown. We propose isolated black holes (IBHs) wandering in molecular clouds as the origins of PeV cosmic rays and LHAASO dark sources. An IBH accretes surrounding dense gas, which forms a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) around the IBH. Magnetic reconnection in the MAD can accelerate cosmic-ray protons up to PeV energies. Cosmic-ray protons of GeV-TeV energies fall to the IBH, whereas cosmic-ray protons at sub-PeV energies can escape from the MAD, providing PeV CRs into the interstellar medium. The sub-PeV cosmic-ray protons interact with the surrounding molecular clouds, producing TeV-PeV gamma rays without emitting GeV-TeV gamma rays. This scenario can explain the dark sources detected by LHAASO. Taking into account the IBH and molecular cloud distributions in our Galaxy, we demonstrate that IBHs can provide a significant contribution to the PeV cosmic rays observed on Earth. Future gamma-ray detectors in the southern sky and neutrino detectors would provide a concrete test to our scenario.\n\n", "2412.08015": "2024-12-11, **On radiative corrections to lepton number violating processes**, Takehiko Asaka et.al., [2412.08015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08015v1)\n\n We consider the minimal model of the seesaw mechanism by introducing two right-handed neutrinos, whose masses are comparable to the electroweak scale. This framework is attractive, since it is testable at terrestrial experiments. A critical consequence of this mechanism is the violation of lepton number conservation due to the Majorana masses of both active neutrinos and heavy neutral leptons. In particular, we investigate the impact of the radiative corrections to Majorana masses of left-handed neutrinos on the lepton number violating processes, such as the neutrinoless double beta decay: $(Z, A) \\to (Z+2,A) + 2 e^-$ and the inverse neutrinoless double beta decay: $e^- e^- \\to W^- W^-$. It is shown that the cross section of the inverse neutrinoless double beta decay can increase by ${\\cal O}(10)$~% when the masses of heavy neutral leptons are ${\\cal O}(1)$~TeV, which has significant implications on future experiments.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2412.08623": "2024-12-11, **A 1% accurate method to include baryonic effects in galaxy-galaxy lensing models**, Matteo Zennaro et.al., [2412.08623v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08623v1)\n\n Galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing are two of the main observational probes in Stage-IV large-scale structure surveys. Unfortunately, the complicated relationship between galaxies and matter limits the exploitation of this data. Galaxy bias models -- such as the hybrid Lagrangian bias expansion -- allow describing galaxy clustering down to scales as small as $k = 0.7h$/Mpc. However, the galaxy-matter cross-power spectra are already affected by baryons on these scales, directly impacting the modelling of galaxy-galaxy lensing. We propose to extend models of the galaxy-matter cross-power spectrum $P\\_{\\rm gm}(k)$ (currently only accounting for dark matter) by including a baryonic correction inferred from the matter component ($S\\_{\\rm mm}(k)$), so that $P\\_{\\rm gm, full \\, physics} (k) = \\sqrt{S\\_{\\rm mm}} P\\_{\\rm gm, gravity \\, only}$. We use the FLAMINGO simulations to measure the effect of baryons on the galaxy-matter cross-power spectrum and to assess the performance of our model. We perform a Bayesian analysis of synthetic data, implementing a model based on BACCO's hybrid Lagrangian bias expansion (for the nonlinear galaxy bias) and Baryon Correction Model. Ignoring baryons in the galaxy-matter cross-power spectrum leads to a biased inference of the galaxy bias, while ignoring baryons in both the galaxy-matter and matter-matter power spectra leads to a biased inference of both the galaxy bias and cosmological parameters. In contrast, our method is 1% accurate compared to all physics variations in FLAMINGO and on all scales described by hybrid perturbative models ($k < 0.7h$/Mpc). Moreover, our model leads to inferred bias and cosmological parameters compatible within 1$\\sigma$ with their reference values.

Previous studies have introduced a method for constructing FDM halos with predefined density profiles. In this study, we investigate the initial global velocity of these constructed halos and find that it is non-zero. We provide the theoretical formula for this velocity and illustrate that it arises from the interference between states of odd and even parity. Our calculated results closely match simulation outcomes. Additionally, we showcase how to counteract this velocity and create a halo with a customizable initial global velocity. Our study presents a practical method for adjusting the initial global velocity of halos in controlled FDM simulations, facilitating investigations into tidal effects, galaxy collisions, and other scenarios.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2412.08601": "2024-12-11, **CCSNscore: A multi-input deep learning tool for classification of core-collapse supernovae using SED-Machine spectra**, Yashvi Sharma et.al., [2412.08601v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08601v1)\n\n Supernovae (SNe) come in various flavors and are classified into different types based on emission and absorption lines in their spectra. SN candidates are now abundant with the advent of large systematic dynamic sky surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), however, the identification bottleneck lies in their spectroscopic confirmation and classification. Fully robotic telescopes with dedicated spectrographs optimized for SN follow-up have eased the burden of data acquisition. However, the task of classifying the spectra still largely rests with the astronomers. Automating this classification step reduces human effort, and can make the SN type available sooner to the public. For this purpose, we have developed a deep-learning based program for classifying core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with ultra-low resolution spectra obtained with the SED-Machine IFU spectrograph on the Palomar 60-inch telescope. The program consists of hierarchical classification task layers, with each layer composed of multiple binary classifiers which are run in parallel to produce a reliable classification. The binary classifiers utilize RNN and CNN architecture and are designed to take multiple inputs, to supplement spectra with g- and r-band photometry from ZTF. On non-host-contaminated and good quality SEDM spectra (\"gold\" test set), CCSNscore is ~94% accurate (correct classifications) in distinguishing between hydrogen-rich (Type II) and hydrogen-poor (Type Ibc) CCSNe. With the help of light curve input, CCSNscore classifies ~83% of the gold set with high confidence (score >= 0.8 and score-error < 0.05), with ~98% accuracy.\n\n", "2412.08449": "2024-12-11, **Calibrating the Tully-Fisher Relation to Measure the Hubble Constant**, Daniel Scolnic et.al., [2412.08449v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08449v1)\n\n Boubel et al. 2024 (B24) recently used the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation to measure calibrated distances in the Hubble flow and found $H\\_0= 73.3 \\pm 2.1 (stat) \\pm 3.5 (sys)$ km/s/Mpc. The large systematic uncertainty was the result of propagating the conflict between two sources of empirical distance calibration: a difference in zeropoint when calibrating the TF relation with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) versus Cepheids and Tip-of-the-Red-Giant-Branch (TRGB) and an apparent difference in zeropoint between two distinct TRGB datasets. We trace the SN Ia-based calibration used in the TF analysis to a study where $H\\_0$ was fixed to 70 km/s/Mpc rather than measured, (with host distances derived from redshifts and the Hubble law), thus introducing a discrepancy with the other empirically calibrated indicators. In addition, we trace the difference in TRGB zeropoints to a miscalibration of $0.14$ mag that should be $\\sim0.01-0.04$ mag. Using the consistent Cepheid and TRGB calibration from B24 while removing the problematic data reduces the systematic error by a factor of two and results in $H\\_0 = 76.3 \\pm 2.1 \\textrm{(stat)} \\pm 1.5 \\textrm{(sys)}$ km/s/Mpc.

Their models are based on a capturing mass Black Hole, with a nearby spiraling binary companion star. The companion star mass feeds the accretion disk around the Black Hole. This energy also fuels an orthogonal precessing X gamma jets. The spiral precessing tail of such microquasars, as the SS433 system, is due to an ultra-relativistic jet, spraying nucleons and electrons at relativistic speeds. The up-down jet is observable in radio, X, gamma spectra. Its long spirals are spread and diluted within a light-year distance. The source is inside the W50 supernova remnant nebula , whose asymmetry reflects the past and present role of the SS433 jet. Very recently HESS, HAWC discovered, surprisingly at a much far disconnected distance from the SS433, the resurgence of a twin gamma beam tail. Nearly 75 years light distance far away from the same inner jet source. The recent standard model is based on an accelerating shock wave which reaccelerates, the resurgence of a PeV nucleon beam and its TeV secondaries. The surprising recollimation of this TeV beam jet is difficult to be accepted, in the assumption of a planarlike Fermi shock wave model. Here we discuss an alternative framework based on known high energy nuclear physics, capable to simultaneously explaining both the disconnected and the aligned hard TeV jet appearance. Several consequences, that might also be able to validate the model, are considered.\n\n"}}
