These GW events can be possible sites of neutrino emission. In this paper, we present a search for neutrino counterparts of 90 GW candidates using IceCube DeepCore, the low-energy infill array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The search is conducted using an unbinned maximum likelihood method, within a time window of 1000 s and uses the spatial and timing information from the GW events. The neutrinos used for the search have energies ranging from a few GeV to several tens of TeV. We do not find any significant emission of neutrinos, and place upper limits on the flux and the isotropic-equivalent energy emitted in low-energy neutrinos. We also conduct a binomial test to search for source populations potentially contributing to neutrino emission.

This method allows to take into account decoherence effects in the transition amplitude induced by the quantum mechanical uncertainties of all particles involved in the process. We extend the method to include coherence loss due to interactions with the environment, similar to collisional line broadening. In addition to generic decoherence induced at the amplitude level, the formalism allows to include, in a straightforward way, additional damping effects related to phase-space integrals over momenta of unobserved particles as well as other classical averaging effects. We apply this method to neutrino oscillation searches at reactor and Gallium experiments and confirm that quantum decoherence is many orders of magnitudes smaller than classical averaging effects and therefore unobservable.

We consider an extension of the Standard Model, which includes three singlet neutrinos which have mass splittings comparable to their decay widths. We show that this tri-resonant structure leads to an appreciable increase in the observed CP asymmetry over that found previously in typical bi-resonant models. To analyse such tri-resonant scenarios, we solve a set of coupled Boltzmann equations, crucially preserving the variations in the relativistic degrees of freedom. We highlight the fact that small variations at high temperatures can have major implications for the evolution of the baryon asymmetry when the singlet neutrino mass scale is below $100$ GeV. We then illustrate how this variation can significantly affect the ability to find successful leptogenesis at these low masses.

In particular, we complement previous studies by exploring the MAHs of haloes with mass from $10^8\\ h^{-1}\\mathrm{M\\_{\\odot}}$ down to Earth mass, $10^{-6}\\ h^{-1}\\mathrm{M\\_{\\odot}}$. The formation redshift of low-mass haloes anti-correlates weakly with mass, peaking at $z=3$ for haloes of mass $10^{-4}\\ h^{-1}\\mathrm{M\\_{\\odot}}$. Even lower masses are affected by the free-streaming cutoff in the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations and form at lower redshift. We compare MAHs in our simulations with predictions from two analytical models based on the extended Press-Schechter theory (EPS), and three empirical models derived by fitting and extrapolating either results from cosmological $N$-body simulations or Monte Carlo realizations of halo growth. All models fit our simulations reasonably well over the mass range for which they were calibrated. While the empirical models match better for more massive haloes, $M>10^{10}\\ h^{-1}\\mathrm{M\\_{\\odot}}$, the analytical models do better when extrapolated down to Earth mass. At the higher masses, we explore the correlation between local environment density and MAH, finding that biases are relatively weak, with typical MAHs for haloes in extremely low-density and in typical regions differing by less than $20$ percent at high redshift.

In such a framework, the standard law of inertia continues to hold, but the gravitational potential associated to a given DM density distribution is determined by a modified Poisson equation including fractional derivatives (i.e., derivatives of non-integer type), that are meant to describe non-local effects. We derive analytically the expression of the potential that in fractional gravity corresponds to various spherically symmetric density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) distribution that is usually exploited to describe virialized halos of collisionless DM as extracted from $N-$body cosmological simulations. We show that in fractional gravity the dynamics of a test particle moving in a cuspy NFW density distribution is substantially altered with respect to the Newtonian case (i.e., basing on the standard Poisson equation), mirroring what in Newtonian gravity would instead be sourced by a density profile with an inner core. We test the fractional gravity framework on galactic scales, showing that: (i) it can provide accurate fits to the stacked rotation curves of galaxies with different properties; (ii) it can reproduce to reasonable accuracy the observed shape and scatter of the radial acceleration relation (RAR); (iii) it can properly account for the universal surface density and the core radius vs. disk scale-length scaling relations.

This model is based on the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFT of LSS) and thus a theoretically well-motivated extension of the familiar non-linear alignment (NLA) model and the tidal-alignment-tidal-torquing (TATT) model. It contains a total of $8$ free bias parameters.

A series of recent studies suggested that there is a significant correlation between the standardized luminosity and the progenitor age of SNe Ia. The correlation found in the most recent work by Lee et al. is strong enough to explain the extra dimming of distant SNe Ia, and therefore casts doubts on the direct evidence of cosmic acceleration. The present work improves the previous work by incorporating the uncertainties of progenitor ages, which were ignored in Lee et al., into a fully Bayesian inference framework. We find a weaker dependence of supernova standardized luminosity on the progenitor age, but the detection of correlation remains significant (3.3$\\sigma$). Assuming that such correlation can be extended to high redshift and applying it to the Pantheon SN Ia data set, we find that the correlation cannot be the primary cause of the observed extra dimming of distant SNe Ia. Further more, we use the PAge formalism, which is a good approximation to many dark energy and modified gravity models, to do a model comparison.

We find that the host filament can shield the young solar system from the stellar feedback, both during the formation and evolution of stars (stellar outflow, wind, and radiation) and at the end of their life (supernovae). We show that the young solar system formed along a dense filament can be enriched with supernova ejecta (e.g., $^{26}$Al) during the formation timescale of CAIs.

Recent findings show that the majority of classical Cepheids should be in binary or multiple systems, which might undermine their accuracy, as the extra -- and unaccounted for -- light from the companions of Cepheids causes a shift in the PLR. We quantify this shift using synthetic populations of binary Cepheids that we developed for this purpose, as described in Paper I of this series. We find that while all PLRs are shifted toward brighter values due to the excess light from the companions, the bias in the relative distance modulus between two galaxies hosting binary Cepheids can be either positive or negative, depending on the percentage of binary Cepheids in them. If the binarity percentage in the two galaxies is similar, the effect of binarity is canceled. Otherwise, it introduces a shift in the distance modulus of the order of millimags in the near-infrared passbands and Wesenheit indices, and tens of millimags in the visual domain; its exact value depends on the variant of the synthetic population (a unique combination of metallicity, star formation history, shape and location of the instability strip, and initial parameter distributions).

We present an extensive search for gravitationally lensed supernovae within the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public survey, covering 12,524 transients with good light curves discovered during four years of observations. We crossmatch a catalogue of known and candidate lens galaxies with our transient sample and find only one coincident source, which was due to chance alignment. To search for supernovae magnified by unknown lens galaxies, we test multiple methods that have been suggested in the literature, for the first time on real data. This includes selecting objects with extremely red colours and those that appear inconsistent with the host galaxy redshift. In both cases, we find a few hundred candidates, most of which are due to contamination from activate galactic nuclei, bogus detections, or unlensed supernovae. The false positive rate from these methods presents significant challenges for future surveys. In total, 65 unique transients were identified across all of our selection methods that required detailed manual rejection, which would be infeasible for larger samples.

The present work improves the previous work by incorporating the uncertainties of progenitor ages, which were ignored in Lee et al., into a fully Bayesian inference framework. We find a weaker dependence of supernova standardized luminosity on the progenitor age, but the detection of correlation remains significant (3.3$\\sigma$). Assuming that such correlation can be extended to high redshift and applying it to the Pantheon SN Ia data set, we find that the correlation cannot be the primary cause of the observed extra dimming of distant SNe Ia. Further more, we use the PAge formalism, which is a good approximation to many dark energy and modified gravity models, to do a model comparison. The concordance Lambda cold dark matter model remains a good fit when the progenitor-age dependence of SN Ia luminosity is corrected. The best-fit parameters, however, are in $\\sim 2\\sigma$ tension with the standard values inferred from cosmic microwave background observations.\n\n", "2303.15066": "2023-03-27, **Low-redshift estimates of the absolute scale of baryon acoustic oscillations**, Thais Lemos et.al., [2303.15066v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15066v1)\n\n Measurements of the characteristic length scale $r\\_s$ of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide a robust determination of the distance-redshift relation. Currently, the best (sub-per cent) estimate of $r\\_s$ at the drag epoch is provided by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations assuming the validity of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model at $z \\sim 1000$. Therefore, inferring $r\\_s$ from low-$z$ observations in a model-independent way and comparing its value with CMB estimates provides a consistency test of the standard cosmology and its assumptions at high-$z$. In this paper, we address this question and estimate the absolute BAO scale combining angular BAO measurements and type Ia Supernovae data. Our analysis uses two different methods to connect these data sets and finds a good agreement between the low-$z$ estimates of $r\\_{s}$ with the CMB sound horizon at drag epoch, regardless of the value of the Hubble constant $H\\_0$ considered. These results highlight the robustness of the standard cosmology at the same time that they also reinforce the need for more precise cosmological observations at low-$z$.\n\n", "2303.15040": "2023-03-27, **Strengthening extended Gravity constraints with combined systems:\\\\ \\texorpdfstring{$f(R)$}{} bounds from Cosmology and the Galactic Center**, D. Benisty et.al., [2303.15040v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15040v1)\n\n MOdified Gravity (MoG)) is widely constrained in different astrophysical and astronomical systems. Since these different systems are based on different scales it is not trivial to get a combined constraint that is based on different phenomenology. Here, for the first time (to the best of our knowledge), we combine constraints for MoG from late time Cosmology and the orbital motion of the stars around the galactic center. MoG give different potentials that are tested directly in the galactic center. The cosmological data set includes the type Ia supernova and baryon acoustic oscillations. For the galactic star center data set we use the published orbital measurements of the S2 star. The constraints on the universal parameter $\\beta$ from the combined system give: $\\beta\\_{HS}=0.154 \\pm 0.109$ for the Hu-Sawicki model, while $\\beta\\_{St}= 0.309 \\pm 0.19 $ for the Starobinsky model. These results improve on the cosmological results we obtain. The results show that {{\\it combined constraint}} from different systems yields a stronger constraint for different theories under consideration. Future measurements from the galactic center and from cosmology will give better constraints on MoG.\n\n", "2303.15007": "2023-03-27, **Sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array to spectral signatures of hadronic PeVatrons with application to Galactic Supernova Remnants**, The Cherenkov Telescope Array Consortium et.al., [2303.15007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15007v1)\n\n The local Cosmic Ray (CR) energy spectrum exhibits a spectral softening at energies around 3~PeV. Sources which are capable of accelerating hadrons to such energies are called hadronic PeVatrons. However, hadronic PeVatrons have not yet been firmly identified within the Galaxy. Several source classes, including Galactic Supernova Remnants (SNRs), have been proposed as PeVatron candidates. The potential to search for hadronic PeVatrons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is assessed. The focus is on the usage of very high energy $\\gamma$-ray spectral signatures for the identification of PeVatrons. Assuming that SNRs can accelerate CRs up to knee energies, the number of Galactic SNRs which can be identified as PeVatrons with CTA is estimated within a model for the evolution of SNRs. Additionally, the potential of a follow-up observation strategy under moonlight conditions for PeVatron searches is investigated. Statistical methods for the identification of PeVatrons are introduced, and realistic Monte--Carlo simulations of the response of the CTA observatory to the emission spectra from hadronic PeVatrons are performed. Based on simulations of a simplified model for the evolution for SNRs, the detection of a $\\gamma$-ray signal from in average 9 Galactic PeVatron SNRs is expected to result from the scan of the Galactic plane with CTA after 10 hours of exposure. CTA is also shown to have excellent potential to confirm these sources as PeVatrons in deep observations with $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ hours of exposure per source.\n\n"}}
