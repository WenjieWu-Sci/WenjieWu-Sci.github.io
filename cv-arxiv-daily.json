Dark matter searches utilizing this process set the most stringent bounds on the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section over a large region of the sub-GeV dark matter parameter space, underscoring its significance in dark matter detection. In this paper, we quantify the regions of dark matter parameter space that are challenging to probe via the Migdal effect due to the presence of dominant solar neutrino backgrounds for both liquid noble and semiconductor targets. Our findings reveal that there is no hard floor in the dark matter parameter space. Instead, we map the so called neutrino fog. In mapping the neutrino fog, we identify the importance of incorporating the Migdal effect induced by neutrinos, as well as neutrino-electron scattering and dominant coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, particularly for semiconductor targets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a large portion of the relic density allowed parameter space lies within the neutrino fog. Finally, we estimate the exposure required to detect neutrino induced Migdal events in direct detection experiments.\n\n", "2412.17584": "2024-12-23, **Search for charged Higgs bosons produced in top-quark decays or in association with top quarks and decaying via $H^{\\pm} \\to \u03c4^{\\pm}\u03bd_\u03c4$ in 13 TeV $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector**, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., [2412.17584v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17584v1)\n\n Charged Higgs bosons produced either in top-quark decays or in association with a top-quark, subsequently decaying via $H^{\\pm} \\to \\tau^{\\pm}\\nu\\_{\\tau}$, are searched for in 140 $\\text{fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector.

After some historical considerations, which provide an initial illustration of the significant role of these concepts, I review some well-known cases of neutrino science, involving both astrophysics and particle physics, which allow us to deepen the analysis. The importance of a harmonious relationship between theoretical elaborations and experiments emerges: effective collaboration between theoretical and experimental physicists played a key role in many of the successful cases and proved marginal or defective in the doubtful ones. The discussion highlights also the need to proceed armed with a patience, a virtue that Feynman himself indicated as essential to science, all the more necessary when investigating interesting but elusive particles such as neutrinos.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2412.17802": "2024-12-23, **Feebly-Interacting Peccei-Quinn Model**, Wen Yin et.al., [2412.17802v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17802v1)\n\n The QCD axion is widely studied as a dark matter (DM) candidate and as a solution to the strong CP problem of the Standard Model. In conventional field-theoretic models, a much larger mass scale than the electroweak (EW) scale is typically introduced to spontaneously break Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry with a large enough axion decay constant, $f\\_a$, thereby avoiding constraints from star cooling. In this paper, I propose an alternative approach to achieving the large decay constant: a PQ scalar field with a large wave function renormalization constant, analogous to a feebly coupled gauge theory. Other dimensionless parameters are ${O}(1)$ in the unit of the EW scale for the naturalness. This framework predicts a light PQ Higgs boson with a mass $\\sim (\\mathrm{EW~scale})^2 / f\\_a$. Exotic particles associated with the PQ anomaly are expected to have masses around the EW scale. The proposed model alleviates both the PQ quality and EW scale fine-tuning problems and introduces interesting axion-PQ Higgs cosmologies, encompassing: slim axion DM from a fat string network, heavy axion DM from PQ Higgs condensate fragmentation, PQ Higgs DM, and axion-PQ Higgs co-DM scenarios. Potential experimental signatures are explored, including fifth-force tests, DM detections, accelerator searches, and gravitational wave observations by employing lattice simulation. Possible extensions of the scenario are also discussed.\n\n", "2412.17719": "2024-12-23, **Revisiting the Inert Scalar Dark Matter with Vector-like Quarks**, Prasanta Kumar Das et.al., [2412.17719v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17719v1)\n\n The inert doublet model (IDM), a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM), provides a scalar dark matter (DM) candidate that belongs to the additional Higgs doublet. The model faces challenges in achieving the correct relic abundance for compressed spectra and DM masses in the high-mass range. In this work we introduce a $Z\\_2$-odd singlet vector-like quark (VLQ) into the IDM framework that helps us alleviate these issues and provide new channels of contributions to the relic abundance. The VLQ not only enhances the DM relic abundance for masses above $~550$ GeV but also eases constraints from direct detection experiments by enabling smaller couplings between the inert scalars and the SM Higgs. We analyze the impact of the VLQ on DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection constraints. The results demonstrate that the extended IDM framework not only resolves existing limitations in the compressed spectrum but also offers exciting prospects for detection in current and future collider experiments.\n\n", "2412.17687": "2024-12-23, **Probing new physics in the era of precision cosmology**, Matteo Forconi et.al., [2412.17687v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17687v1)\n\n Over the past decades, advancements in observational cosmology have introduced us in an era of precision cosmology, dramatically enhancing our understanding of the Universe's history as well as bringing new tensions to light.

Schaefer et.al., [2412.17286v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17286v1)\n\n V445 Puppis is the only known example of a helium nova, where a layer of helium-rich gas accretes onto the surface of a white dwarf in a cataclysmic variable, with runaway helium burning making for the nova event. Speculatively, helium nova can provide one path to produce a Type Ia supernova (SNIa), within the larger framework of single-degenerate models. Relatively little has been known about V445 Pup, with this work reporting the discovery of the orbital period near 1.87 days. The companion star is 2.65$\\pm$0.35 R$\\_{\\odot}$ in radius as an evolved giant star stripped of its outer hydrogen envelope. The orbital period immediately before the 2000 eruption was $P\\_{\\rm pre}$=1.871843$\\pm$0.000014 days, with a steady period change of (-0.17$\\pm$0.06)$\\times$10$^{-8}$ from 1896--1995. The period immediately after the nova eruption was $P\\_{\\rm post}$=1.873593$\\pm$0.000034 days, with a $\\dot{P}$ of ($-$4.7$\\pm$0.5)$\\times$10$^{-8}$. The fractional orbital period change ($\\Delta P/P$) is $+$935$\\pm$27 ppm. This restricts the mass of the gases ejected in the nova eruption to be $\\gg$0.001M$\\_{\\odot}$, and much greater than the mass accreted to trigger the nova. So the white dwarf is losing mass over each eruption cycle, and will not become a SNIa. Further, for V445 Pup and helium novae in general, I collect observations from 136 normal SNIa, for which any giant or sub-giant companion star would have been detected, yet zero companions are found. This is an independent proof that V445 Pup and helium novae are not SNIa progenitors.\n\n"}}
