The link between the properties of structures and the cosmic environments may help to unravel the nature of the dark sector of the Universe. In this paper, we study the cosmic web environments from the spatial pattern perspective in the context of $ \\Lambda $CDM and $ \\nu \\Lambda $CDM as an example of an extension to the vanilla model. To do this, we use the T-web classification method and classify the cosmic environments for the catalogues from the gevolution N-body simulations for $ \\Lambda $CDM and $ \\nu \\Lambda $CDM cosmology. Then, we compute the first nearest neighbour cumulative distribution function, spherical contact cumulative distribution function, and $ J$-function for every cosmic environment. In the context of the standard model, the results indicate that these functions can differentiate the various cosmic environments. In association with distinguishing between extensions of the standard model of cosmologies, these functions within the cosmic environment seem beneficial as a complementary probe.\n\n", "2407.18211": "2024-07-25, **Confronting a Standard Model extension with a dark $U(1)$ gauge sector with the prediction for the W-boson mass**, Stefan Dittmaier et.al., [2407.18211v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18211v1)\n\n The Dark Abelian Sector Model (DASM) is an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics with an additional spontaneously broken $U\\_\\text{d}(1)$ gauge symmetry connected to a dark sector, i.e. the SM particles do not carry the corresponding charge.

The usual approach for simulating these effects is by numerically integrating the Schrodinger equation over the neutrino trajectory, arriving at the conversion and survival probabilities for each flavor. From these, the neutrino mixing matrix and its parameters are recovered. This work makes the case for a different numerical approach, which starts by recognizing how Jacobi's diagonalization algorithm is the most suitable for neutrino oscillations in general. By switching from physical space to a parameter space of choice, Jacobi's algorithm results in both eigenvalues and eigenvectors simultaneously, with only local round-off errors. This approach is trivially parallelizable, making it a suitable choice for concurrent computation. Moreover, the freedom to build a parameter space allows for quasi-model-independent solutions, which in turn eliminates the necessity of repeating the simulation for every change in the model's parameters.

Slow roll inflation results in a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum that maintains its scale invariance as it transitions into the radiation-dominated era. However, introducing an intermediate reheating phase can modify the spectral tilt, depending on the equation of state governing that particular epoch. These GWs, especially on smaller scales, are anticipated to be observable by forthcoming GW detectors. In this study, we initially delineate the parameter space encompassing the inflationary energy scale, reheating temperature, and equation of state in a model-independent manner, focusing on the spectra detectable by GW detectors such as LISA, ET, DECIGO, and BBO. We also examine the implications for the $\\alpha$-attractor model of inflation and explore the observational constraints on $n\\_s-r$ prediction in the light of GW detection. Then, we point out the probable ranges for various non-gravitational and gravitational coupling between the inflaton and Standard Model particles considering the perturbative reheating. If one assumes PBHs were formed during the early reheating era, such detection of GW signal also sheds light on the probing PBH parameters. Note that for the case of PBH domination, we also consider the contribution of the induced GW due to the density function in PBH distribution, which helps to decode the phase of early PBH domination. Finally, to test the production of other cosmological relics through future GW missions, we consider dark matter produced via gravitational interaction in the early universe.\n\n", "2407.18084": "2024-07-25, **Testing non-local gravity through Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies kinematics**, Filippo Bouch\u00e8 et.al., [2407.18084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18084v1)\n\n The emergence of the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in recent years has posed a severe challenge to the galaxy formation models as well as the Extended Theories of Gravity. The existence of both dark matter lacking and dark matter dominated systems within the same family of astrophysical objects indeed requires the gravity models to be versatile enough to describe very different gravitational regimes. In this work, we study a non-local extension of the theory of General Relativity that has drawn increasing attention in recent years due to its capability to account for the late time cosmic acceleration without introducing any dark energy fluid. We leverage the kinematic data of three Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies: NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4, which are dark matter lacking, and Dragonfly 44, which exhibits a highly dominant dark matter component. Our analysis shows that the non-local corrections to the Newtonian potential do not affect the kinematic predictions, hence no spoiling effects emerge when the Non-local Gravity model serves as a dark energy model.

In this paper, we argue that a significant fraction of the observed warm-ion columns may arise in the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding galactic halos. We use a simple spherical collapse model of the dark matter (DM) halos and their baryonic content to compute the evolving ion fractions within and outside virial halos. We show that the photoionized IGM may produce a thick blanket of warm ions around the CGM, thereby contaminating CGM observations. We find that the IGM contributes $> 75\\%$ of the total \\ion{O}{6} column densities in halos with virial masses exceeding a few times $10^{11}~M\\_\\odot$, and that it may dominate the \\ion{O}{6} absorption even for lower mass-halos, depending on the impact parameter. We compare our results with observations and find that our simplified model reproduces the overall \\ion{O}{6} columns as well as their trend with the impact parameter and halo mass. We show that observed warm ion columns may be completely dominated by the IGM envelopes, consistent with CGM$^2$ data. We, therefore, suggest that theoretical interpretations of CGM-survey observations must consider the possible contribution of the surrounding IGM. Although our simplified model suggests that it may be possible to kinematically distinguish between CGM and IGM origins through the absorption line profiles, this distinction is likely unfeasible in realistic astrophysical halos, due to the complex velocity structure in the multi-phased CGM.\n\n", "2407.17872": "2024-07-25, **The DAMIC-M Low Background Chamber**, I.

Wu et.al., [2407.17809v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17809v1)\n\n We present a measurement of the mean absorption of cool gas traced by Mg II (${\\lambda\\lambda 2796, 2803}$) around emission line galaxies (ELGs), spanning spatial scales from 20 kpc to 10 Mpc. The measurement is based on cross-matching the positions of about 2.5 million ELGs at $z = 0.75-1.65$ and the metal absorption in the spectra of 1.4 million background quasars with data provided by the Year 1 sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The ELGs are divided into two redshift intervals: $0.75 < z < 1.0$ and $1.0 < z < 1.65$. We find that the composite spectra constructed by stacking the ELG-QSO pairs show evolution with redshift, with $z>1$ having a systematically higher signal of Mg II absorption. Within 1 Mpc, the covering fraction of the cool gas at $z > 1$ is higher than that of $z < 1$. The enhancement becomes less apparent especially if the projected distance $r\\_{p}>$1 Mpc. Also, ELGs with higher stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) yield higher clustering of Mg II absorbers at $z<1$. For $z>1$, the covering fractions with different SFRs show little difference. The higher Mg II absorption at higher redshift also supports the observations of higher star formation at cosmic noon. Besides, the profile of Mg II absorption reveals a change of slope on scales of about 1 Mpc, consistent with the expected transition from a dark matter halo-dominated environment to a regime where clustering is dominated by halo-halo correlations. We estimate the cool gas density profile and derive the metal abundance at different redshifts.

We investigate this detection by analyzing its frequency dependence and sensitivity to component separation methods, suggesting that Galactic foregrounds are unlikely to be the cause. Contrary to previous studies, we find that the decrement is independent of galaxy type, indicating a possible correlation between the CMB and the overall matter density field. To test this hypothesis, we employ three analytical approaches: cross-correlation analysis, template fitting, and Bayes Factor calculation. Our cross-correlation analysis shows a significant correlation (p < 0.7%) between the CMB and the 2MASS Redshift Survey projected matter density at distances below 50 Mpc/h. Template fitting and Bayes Factor analyses support this finding, albeit with lower significance levels (1% - 5%). Importantly, we do not detect this signal beyond 50 Mpc/h, which constrains potential physical interpretations. We discuss that the physical origin of this correlation could potentially be linked to the dark matter distribution in the halos of galaxies.

The simulations solve the Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson equations, examining the spin density distribution and its evolution during gravitational collapse and halo formation. Our results reveal that VDM forms halos and central Proca stars from homogeneous and isotropic conditions, with the polarization density fluctuation amplitude mirroring VDM matter density. In scenarios with no initial polarization, spin density remains stable in the halo core but fluctuates in outer regions.

Notably, recent estimates of the faint-end UVLF at $z\\sim5-9$ in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, probe up to five magnitudes fainter than typical (\"blank-field\") regions. These measurements thus far disfavor prominent turnovers in the UVLF at low luminosity, implying bounds on FDM.

This fit excludes cases where the dark matter is entirely a boson of mass $m<1.5\\times10^{-21}$ eV (with $2\\sigma$ confidence).

This indicates that the CSST SN Ia and BAO surveys can effectively constrain and test the $f(R)$ theory.\n\n", "2407.17143": "2024-07-24, **Astrophysical and cosmological scenarios for gravitational wave heating**, Nigel T. Bishop et.al., [2407.17143v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17143v1)\n\n Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through a viscous shell of matter are expected to be damped resulting in an increase in the temperature of the fluid as energy is transferred to it from the GWs. In previous work we constructed a model for this process, obtaining an expression for the temperature distribution inside the shell, and it was shown that the temperature increase can be astrophysically significant. In this paper we extend the analysis to GW heating and damping following a binary neutron star merger, GW heating during a core-collapse supernova, and primordial gravitational waves.\n\n"}}
