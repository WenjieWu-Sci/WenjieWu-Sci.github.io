These limits mainly rely on Cosmic Microwave Background temperature anisotropies. Nonetheless, one of the largest cosmological signatures of thermal relics is that on gravitational lensing, due to their free streaming behavior before their non-relativistic period. We investigate late time only hot relic mass constraints, primarily based on recently released lensing data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, both alone and in combination with lensing data from the Planck Satellite. Additionally, we consider other local probes, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations measurements, shear-shear, galaxy-galaxy, and galaxy-shear correlation functions from the Dark Energy Survey, and distance moduli measurements from Type Ia Supernovae. The tightest bounds we find are $\\sum m\\_\\nu<0.43$ eV and $m\\_a<1.1$ eV, both at $95\\%$ CL. Interestingly, these limits are still much stronger than those found on e.g. laboratory neutrino mass searches, reassessing the robustness of the extraction of thermal relic properties via cosmological observations. In addition, when considering lensing-only data, the significance of the Hubble constant tension is considerably reduced, while the clustering parameter $\\sigma\\_8$ controversy is completely absent.\n\n", "2307.14121": "2023-07-26, **Diraxiogenesis**, Maximilian Berbig et.al., [2307.14121v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14121v1)\n\n The family of Dirac Seesaw models offers an intriguing alternative explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses without necessarily requiring microscopic lepton number violation, when compared to the more familiar class of Majorana Seesaws. A global $\\text{U}(1)\\_\\text{D}$ symmetry, that is explicitly broken by a higher dimensional scalar operator, ensures that the right handed neutrino does not couple directly to the Standard Model like Higgs and an exact gauged or residual lepton number symmetry prohibits all Majorana masses. We demonstrate that all three Dirac Seesaws possess a Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the $\\text{U}(1)\\_\\text{D}$ symmetry, that we call the Diraxion, whose cosmological dynamics have so far been left unexplored. Furthermore we illustrate that a Dirac-Leptogenesis version of the recently proposed Lepto-Axiogenesis scenario can be realized in this class of models, leading to a unified origin of the observed baryon asymmetry and dark matter relic abundance. Explaining only the baryon asymmetry can lead to potentially observable amounts of right handed neutrino dark radiation with $\\Delta N\\_\\text{eff.}\\lesssim 0.028$. On the other hand, if we only fix the dark matter abundance via the kinetic misalignment mechanism, this set-up could lead to detectable signatures in proposed cosmic neutrino background experiments via decays of eV-scale Diraxions to neutrinos. Here there is no domain wall problem, since topological defects immediately decay to a subleading fraction of relic Diraxions. A key ingredient of all Axiogenesis scenarios is the dynamics of relatively light scalar called the Saxion, that in our case has a mass at the GeV-scale and which might reveal itself in heavy meson decays or collider searches. Our setup predicts isocurvature perturbations in baryons, dark matter and dark radiation sourced by fluctuations of the Saxion.\n\n", "2307.14102": "2023-07-26, **Automatic test system for the data acquisition board of GRANDProto300**, Yiren Chen et.al., [2307.14102v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14102v1)\n\n The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect the radio emission from air showers triggered by ultra-high-energy particles in the atmosphere.

With an energy threshold of about 10 TeV and a wide field-of-view, the IceAct telescopes show promising capabilities of improving current cosmic-ray composition studies: measuring the Cherenkov light emissions in the atmosphere adds new information about the shower development not accessible with the current detectors. First simulations indicate that the added information of a single telescope leads, e.g., to an improved discrimination between flux contributions from different primary particle species in the sensitive energy range.

Since 2019 additionally two Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes, called IceAct, measure the electromagnetic component of air showers in the atmosphere above the IceCube detector. This opens the possibility to measure air shower parameters in three independent detectors and allows to improve mass composition studies with the IceCube data. One IceAct camera consists of 61 SiPM pixels in a hexagonal grid. Each pixel has a field of view of 1.5 degree resulting in an approximately 12-degree field of view per camera. A single telescope tube has a diameter of 50 cm, is built robust enough to withstand the harsh Antarctic conditions, and is able to detect cosmic ray particles with energies above approximately 10 TeV. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is trained to determine the air shower properties from IceAct data. The composition analysis is then performed using Random Forest Regression (RF). Since all three detectors have a different energy threshold, we train several RFs with different inputs, combining the different detectors and taking advantage of the lower energy threshold of the IceAct telescopes.

These include a microscopic description of ice anisotropy arising from ice crystal birefringence and a more complete mapping of the ice layer undulations across the detector. The improvements feed into more accurate descriptions of individual events, and can especially affect the directional reconstruction of particle showers. Here, we apply the latest ice model in an exact manner to reconstruct IceCube's high-energy events using DirectFit.

Due to its ability to measure lower neutrino energies than other locations, we find that the best prospects for the atmospheric neutrino flux are at the SURF location, while the prospects are weakest at CJPL because it is restricted to higher neutrino energies. On the contrary, the prospects for the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) are best at CJPL, due largely to the reduced atmospheric neutrino background at this location. Including full detector resolution and efficiency models, the CNO component of the solar flux is detectable via the electron recoil channel with exposures of $\\sim 10^3$ ton-yr for all locations.

Hence, we propose a simplest extension of the standard model -- a flavor-dependent $U(1)$ gauge symmetry -- and find the new physics insight. For this aim, the $U(1)$ charge, called $X$, is expressed as $X=x B+y L$ in which $x$ and $y$ are free parameters as functions of flavor index, e.g. for a flavor $i$ they take $x\\_i$ and $y\\_i$ respectively, where $B$ and $L$ denote normal baryon and lepton numbers.

The most promising mechanism of GRHs is the re-acceleration of non-thermal electrons and positrons by merger-induced turbulence. However, the origin of these seed leptons has been under debate, and either protons or electrons can be primarily-accelerated particles. In this work, we demonstrate that neutrinos can be used as a probe of physical processes in galaxy clusters, and discuss possible constraints on the amount of relativistic protons in the intra-cluster medium with the existing upper limits by IceCube. We calculate radio and neutrino emission from massive ($>10^{14}M\\_\\odot$) galaxy clusters, using the cluster population model of Nishiwaki & Asano (2022). This model is compatible with the observed statistics of GRHs, and we find that the contribution of GRHs to the isotropic radio background observed with the ARCADE-2 experiment should be subdominant. Our fiducial model predicts the all-sky neutrino flux that is consistent with IceCube's upper limit from the stacking analysis.

We investigate the breathing and anisotropic collective modes by numerically solving the GPP equation and using the variational method. The breathing mode shows that the period decreases with the total mass due to the density dependence of the self-gravitating BEC, which is quantitatively consistent with our analytical results. We also obtain an anisotropic collective mode, in which the quadrupole mode is coupled with the breathing mode. The period of the quadrupole mode has the same total mass dependence as that of the breathing mode. The characteristics of these periods are different from those of ordinary BECs trapped by an external potential.

At $z=0$ the halo mass functions are hardly distinguishable from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM, therefore the models with the bumpy spectra can be identified in observations by their excess in number of bright sources at high redshift only\n\n", "2307.13738": "2023-07-25, **The GMRT archive atomic gas survey -- II. Mass modelling and dark matter halo properties across late-type spirals**, Prerana Biswas et.al., [2307.13738v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13738v1)\n\n Studying the kinematics and mass modelling of galaxies from HI 21 cm data provides valuable insights into the properties of both the baryonic components and the dark matter halo in nearby galaxies. Despite many observational studies, mass modelling of galaxies remains challenging due to different limitations. For example, most of the previous studies involving mass modelling are based on rotation curves derived from two-dimensional velocity fields from HI or H$\\alpha$ spectroscopic observation which are often affected by beam smearing and projection effect. However, kinematic modelling done by fitting the \"Tilted ring model\" to three-dimensional data cube is not affected by these issues. In this study, we present and compare 3D kinematic modelling of a pilot sample of eleven galaxies from the GMRT archive atomic gas survey (GARCIA) using two different publicly available pipelines. We model the observed HI rotation curve using 3.6 $\\mu$m infrared data and SDSS r-band data for stellar contribution, HI surface density profile for gas, and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile for dark matter halo; and employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) optimization method for parameter estimation. Further, to validate our analysis, we revisit important scaling relations, e.g., the M$\\_{gas}$-M$\\_{star}$ relation, M$\\_{star}$-M$\\_{halo}$ relation, M$\\_{gas}$-M$\\_{halo}$ relation and Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). The scaling relations from our analysis are broadly consistent with that reported in the literature. A larger sample of galaxies from GARCIA in the near future will allow studying these scaling relations in greater details.\n\n", "2307.13727": "2023-07-25, **Limiting Light Dark Matter with Luminous Hadronic Loops**, Joe Bramante et.al., [2307.13727v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13727v1)\n\n Dark matter is typically assumed not to couple to the photon at tree level. While annihilation to photons through quark loops is often considered in indirect detection searches, such loop-level effects are usually neglected in direct detection, as they are typically subdominant to tree-level dark matter-nucleus scattering. However, when dark matter is lighter than around 100 MeV, it carries so little momentum that it is difficult to detect with nuclear recoils at all. We show that loops of low-energy hadronic states can generate an effective dark matter-photon coupling, and thus lead to scattering with electrons even in the absence of tree-level dark matter-electron scattering. For light mediators, this leads to an effective fractional electric charge which may be very strongly constrained by astrophysical observations. Current and upcoming searches for dark matter-electron scattering can thus set limits on dark matter-proton interactions down to 1 MeV and below.\n\n", "2307.13723": "2023-07-25, **Dual-sided Charge-Coupled Devices**, Javier Tiffenberg et.al., [2307.13723v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13723v1)\n\n Existing Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs) operate by detecting either the electrons or holes created in an ionization event.

We show that this dual detection strategy provides exceptional dark-count rejection and enhanced timing capabilities.

We prove that this solution of the Kerr-like black hole is indeed a solution to the Einstein field equations. Finally, taking M87 as an example, we study and analyze some physical properties of this Kerr-like black hole, and then compare them with the Kerr black hole.

Armstrong et.al., [2307.13862v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13862v1)\n\n As the scale of cosmological surveys increases, so does the complexity in the analyses. This complexity can often make it difficult to derive the underlying principles, necessitating statistically rigorous testing to ensure the results of an analysis are consistent and reasonable. This is particularly important in multi-probe cosmological analyses like those used in the Dark Energy Survey and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time, where accurate uncertainties are vital. In this paper, we present a statistically rigorous method to test the consistency of contours produced in these analyses, and apply this method to the Pippin cosmological pipeline used for Type Ia supernova cosmology with the Dark Energy Survey. We make use of the Neyman construction, a frequentist methodology that leverages extensive simulations to calculate confidence intervals, to perform this consistency check. A true Neyman construction is too computationally expensive for supernova cosmology, so we develop a method for approximating a Neyman construction with far fewer simulations. We find that for a simulated data-set, the 68% contour reported by the Pippin pipeline and the 68% confidence region produced by our approximate Neyman construction differ by less than a percent near the input cosmology, however show more significant differences far from the input cosmology, with a maximal difference of 0.05 in $\\Omega\\_{M}$, and 0.07 in $w$.

Sprout solves the equations of ideal hydrodynamics on an expanding Cartesian mesh. The expanding mesh can follow fluid outflows for several orders of magnitude with very little numerical diffusion, thereby capturing shocks and fine structures accurately. Following the bulk flow accurately also allows for longer timesteps in general. This makes Sprout particularly suitable for studying expanding outflows such as supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei. Relative to other moving mesh codes, the simple mesh structure in Sprout is also convenient for implementing additional physics or algorithms. Many code tests are performed to test the accuracy and performance of the numerical scheme.\n\n", "2307.13743": "2023-07-25, **Aspects of Everpresent $\u039b$ (II): Cosmological Tests of Current Models**, Santanu Das et.al., [2307.13743v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13743v1)\n\n This paper investigates Everpresent $\\Lambda$, a stochastic dark energy model motivated by causal set theory and unimodular gravity, and confronts it with two key observational data sets, Supernova Ia (SN Ia) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. A key feature of this model is that $\\Lambda$ fluctuates over time and on average the magnitude of its fluctuations is of the order of the dominant energy density (be it radiation or matter) for the given epoch. In particular, we focus on a phenomenological implementation of Everpresent $\\Lambda$ known as Model 1. The random fluctuations in Everpresent $\\Lambda$ realizations are generated using seed numbers, and we find that for a small fraction of seeds Model 1 is capable of producing realizations that fit SN Ia data better than $\\Lambda$CDM. We further investigate what features distinguish these realizations from the more general behaviour, and find that the \"good'' realizations have relatively small fluctuations at low redshifts ($z<1.5$), which do not closely track the matter density. We find that Model 1 struggles to improve on $\\Lambda$CDM at describing the CMB data. However, by suppressing the values of $\\Lambda$ near the last scattering surface, as suggested in arXiv:1703.06265, we find a large improvement in the best fit of the model, though still with a $\\chi^2$ value much larger than that of $\\Lambda$CDM. We also study the allowed variation of the dark energy density by the CMB constraints in a more model-independent manner, and find that some variation (especially prior to recombination) is possible and in fact can lead to improvement over $\\Lambda$CDM and reduce the Hubble tension, in line with some early dark energy proposals. However, for the kinds of variations considered, the favoured fluctuations are smaller in magnitude than is typical in current Everpresent $\\Lambda$ models.\n\n", "2307.13728": "2023-07-25, **Robust constraints on feebly interacting particles using XMM-Newton**, Pedro De la Torre Luque et.al., [2307.13728v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13728v1)\n\n During galactic Supernova (SN) explosions, a large amount of feebly interacting particles (FIPs) may be produced. In this work we analyze electrophilic FIPs with masses in the MeV-range that escape from SN and decay into electron-positron pairs, causing an exotic leptonic injection. This contribution adds up to known components, leading to an unexpected excess of X-ray fluxes generated by inverse-Compton scattering of the injected particles on low-energy photon backgrounds. For the first time in the context of FIPs, we use XMM-Newton X-ray measurements to obtain the strongest and most robust bounds on electrophilic FIPs produced by SN in our Galaxy.\n\n", "2307.13696": "2023-07-25, **The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: Cosmological Biases from Host Galaxy Mismatch of Type Ia Supernovae**, H. Qu et.al., [2307.13696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13696v1)\n\n Redshift measurements, primarily obtained from host galaxies, are essential for inferring cosmological parameters from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Matching SNe to host galaxies using images is non-trivial, resulting in a subset of SNe with mismatched hosts and thus incorrect redshifts. We evaluate the host galaxy mismatch rate and resulting biases on cosmological parameters from simulations modeled after the Dark Energy Survey 5-Year (DES-SN5YR) photometric sample. For both DES-SN5YR data and simulations, we employ the directional light radius method for host galaxy matching. In our SN Ia simulations, we find that 1.7% of SNe are matched to the wrong host galaxy, with redshift difference between the true and matched host of up to 0.6. Using our analysis pipeline, we determine the shift in the dark energy equation of state parameter (Dw) due to including SNe with incorrect host galaxy matches. For SN Ia-only simulations, we find Dw = 0.0013 +/- 0.0026 with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Including core-collapse SNe and peculiar SNe Ia in the simulation, we find that Dw ranges from 0.0009 to 0.0032 depending on the photometric classifier used. This bias is an order of magnitude smaller than the expected total uncertainty on w from the DES-SN5YR sample of around 0.03. We conclude that the bias on w from host galaxy mismatch is much smaller than the uncertainties expected from the DES-SN5YR sample, but we encourage further studies to reduce this bias through better host-matching algorithms or selection cuts.\n\n", "2307.13491": "2023-07-25, **Reverberation of pulsar wind nebulae (III): Modelling of the plasma interface empowering a long term radiative evolution**, R. Bandiera et.al., [2307.13491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13491v1)\n\n The vast majority of Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) present in the Galaxy is formed by middle-aged systems characterized by a strong interaction of the PWN itself with the supernova remnant (SNR). Unfortunately, modelling these systems can be quite complex and numerically expensive, due to the non-linearity of the PWN-SNR evolution even in the simple 1D / one-zone case when the reverse shock of the SNR reaches the PWN, and the two begin to interact (and reverberation starts).   Here we introduce a new numerical technique that couples the numerical efficiency of the one-zone thin shell approach with the reliability of a full ``lagrangian'' evolution, able to correctly reproduce the PWN-SNR interaction during the reverberation and to consistently evolve the particle spectrum beyond. Based on our previous findings, we show that our novel strategy resolves many of the uncertainties present in previous approaches, as the arbitrariness in the SNR structure, and ensure a robust evolution, compatible with results that can be obtained with more complex 1D dynamical approaches. Our approach enable us for the first time to provide reliable spectral models of the later compression phases in the evolution of PWNe. While in general we found that the compression is less extreme than that obtained without such detailed dynamical considerations, leading to the formation of less structured spectral energy distributions, we still find that a non negligible fraction of PWNe might experience a super-efficient phase, with the optical and/or X-ray luminosity exceeding the spin-down one.\n\n", "2307.13464": "2023-07-25, **Cosmographic view on the $H_0$ and $\u03c3_8$ tensions**, Rocco D'Agostino et.al., [2307.13464v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13464v1)\n\n Measurements of the $H\\_0$ and $\\sigma\\_8$ parameters within the standard cosmological model recently highlighted significant statistical tensions between the cosmic microwave background and low-redshift probes, such as local distance ladder, weak lensing and galaxy clustering surveys.
