We model the dynamics of jet propagating within an external density medium, accounting for continuous energy injection driven by accretion activities. We compute the time-dependent synchrotron and inverse Compton emissions from the reverse shock region. Our analysis demonstrates that the reverse shock scenario can potentially explain the X-ray light curves and spectra of four jetted TDEs, AT 2022cmc, Swift J1644, Swift J2058, and Swift J1112. Notably, the rapid steepening of the late-stage X-ray light curves can be attributed jointly to the jet break and cessation of the central engine as the accretion rate drops below the Eddington limit.

Because of their relatively low $\\gamma$-ray radiation luminosities ($L\\_\\gamma$), it is rather challenging to confirm such a hypothesis with the neutrino/GeV flare association. Here we report on the search for GeV $\\gamma$-ray counterpart of the neutrino IC-180213A and show that the nearby ($z$ = 0.03) broad line radio galaxy 3C 120 is the unique co-spatial GeV $\\gamma$-ray source in a half-year epoch around the neutrino detection. Particularly, an intense $\\gamma$-ray flare, the second strongest one among the entire 16-year period, is temporally coincident with the detection of IC-180213A.

Elsheshtawy et.al., [2411.07787v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07787v1)\n\n We propose an extension of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM) that explains both neutrino masses and dark matter (DM) in the intermediate-mass range by incorporating a $U(1)\\_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. This additional symmetry enables the inclusion of right-handed neutrinos, providing a natural mechanism for neutrino mass generation. While the CP-even component of the inert doublet can serve as a DM candidate, its thermal relic abundance is insufficient to match the observed DM density. To address this, we introduce a non-thermal production mechanism, where a heavy scalar associated with the $U(1)\\_{B-L}$ symmetry decays into the inert doublet scalar, yielding a viable relic abundance at low reheating temperatures.

Unique structure suppression features under the influence of ULAs are studied from angular correlations of the neutral hydrogen signals observed at different frequencies. Moreover, ULAs can behave like dark energy or dark matter at different mass regimes, implying that the fraction of the ULA energy density would be correlated with the sum of neutrino masses and the parameters of the dark energy equation of state for dark matter and dark energy like ULAs, respectively.

This study evaluates the sensitivity of three next-generation neutrino detectors which are Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K), and the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to supernova neutrinos, specifically focusing on their ability to discern between normal and inverted mass hierarchies. We utilize three different flux models: Bollig, Tamborra and Nakazato, employing the SNEWPY software to simulate the expected neutrino fluxes from core-collapse supernovae. These models highlight the variability in the predictions due to different progenitors and simulation methods. By analyzing the event rates across various interaction channels and implementing the adiabatic Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect on the neutrino flux, we have calculated the expected detection rates for each detector. Our results indicate that sensitivities range from ${\\sim}3\\sigma$ to ${\\sim}9\\sigma$ for DUNE, ${\\sim}4\\sigma$ to ${\\sim}16\\sigma$ for Hyper-K and ${\\sim}1.7\\sigma$ to ${\\sim}6.7\\sigma$ for JUNO depending on distance and flux model, with sensitivity diminishing significantly at larger distances.

The precise charge and timing information extracted from the PMT waveform plays a crucial role in energy and vertex reconstruction. In this study, we investigate the deconvolution algorithm utilized for PMT waveform reconstruction, while enhancing the timing separation ability for pile-up hits by redesigning filters based on the time-frequency uncertainty principle. This filter design sacrifices signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to achieve narrower pulse widths. Furthermore, we optimize the selection of signal pulses in the case of low SNR based on Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Monte Carlo data confirms that our optimization yields enhanced reconstruction performance: improving timing separation ability for pile-up hits from $\\sim$10 ns to $3\\sim5$ ns, while controlling residual nonlinearity of charge reconstruction within 1\\%.\n\n", "2411.07507": "2024-11-12, **Physics of radio antennas**, Mohammad Ful Hossain Seikh et.al., [2411.07507v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07507v1)\n\n Radio antennas are widely used in the field of particle astrophysics in searches for ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and neutrinos (UHEN).

New observatories and advanced simulations are revolutionising our understanding of the cycling of matter into, through, and out of galaxies. This chapter first describes why baryons are essential for galaxy evolution, providing a key test of Lambda-Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. In particular, we describe a basic framework to convert measurements of the gas properties observed in absorption spectra into global estimates of the condensed (stars and cold gas) matter mass densities. We then review our current understanding of the cycling of baryons from global to galactic scales, in the so-called circumgalactic medium. The final sections are dedicated to future prospects, identifying new techniques and up-coming facilities as well as key open questions. This chapter is complemented with a series of hands-on exercises which provide a practical guide to using publicly available hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Beyond providing a direct connection between new observations and advanced simulations, these exercises give the reader the necessary tools to make use of these theoretical models to address their own science questions.

While star formation occurs on sub-parsec scales within dark matter (DM) minihalos, it is influenced by large-scale baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v\\_{\\rm bc}$) and Lyman-Werner (LW) radiative feedback which vary significantly on scales of $\\sim$100 Mpc. We present a novel approach to this issue in which we utilize artificial neural networks (NNs) to emulate the Population III (PopIII) and Population II (PopII) star formation histories of many small-scale cells given by a more complex semi-analytic framework based on DM halo merger trees. Within each simulation cell, the NN takes a set of input parameters that depend on the surrounding large-scale environment, such as the cosmic overdensity, $\\delta(\\vec{x})$, and $v\\_{\\rm bc}$ of the cell, then outputs the resulting star formation far more efficiently than is possible with the semi-analytic model. This rapid emulation allows us to self-consistently determine the LW background intensity on $\\sim$100 Mpc scales, while simultaneously including the detailed merger histories (and corresponding star formation histories) of the low-mass minihalos that host the first stars. Comparing with the full semi-analytic framework utilizing DM halo merger trees, our NN emulators yield star formation histories with redshift-averaged errors of $\\sim$10.2\\% and $\\sim$9.2\\% for PopII and PopIII, respectively. When compared to a simpler sub-grid star formation prescription reliant on halo mass function integration, we find that the diversity of halo merger histories in our simulation leads to enhanced spatial fluctuations, an earlier transition from PopIII to PopII dominated star formation, and more scatter in star formation histories overall.\n\n", "2411.07713": "2024-11-12, **Wormhole-Induced ALP Dark Matter**, Dhong Yeon Cheong et.al., [2411.07713v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07713v1)\n\n Non-perturbative gravitational effects induce explicit global symmetry breaking terms within axion models. These exponentially suppressed terms in the potential give a mass contribution to the axion-like particles (ALPs). In this work we investigate this scenario with a scalar field charged under a global $U(1)$ symmetry and having a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Given the exponential dependence, the ALP can retain a mass spanning a wide range, which can act as a dark matter component. We specify pre-inflationary and post-inflationary production mechanisms of these ALPs, with the former from the misalignment mechanism and the latter from both the misalignment and cosmic-string decay. We identify the allowed parameter ranges that explain the dark matter abundance for both a general inflation case and a case where the radial mode scalar drives inflation, each in metric and Palatini formalisms. We show that the ALP can be the dominant component of the dark matter in a wide range of its mass, $m\\_{a} \\in [10^{-21}~\\mathrm{eV},\\, \\mathrm{TeV}]$, depending on the inflationary scenario and the $U(1)$ breaking scale.

Through numerical calculations, we find certain parameter spaces of the critical thresholds for the type A PBH formation and reveal a maximum critical threshold value. We also find that there is a region where no PBH is produced from type II fluctuations contrary to a previous study. We then confirm that SIGW signals originated from the logarithmic non-Gaussianity are detectable in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna if PBHs account for whole dark matter. Finally, we discuss the SIGW interpretation of the nHz stochastic gravitational wave background reported by the recent pulsar timing array observations. We find that PBH overproduction is a serious problem for most of the parameter space, while this tension might still be alleviated in the non-perturbative regime.\n\n", "2411.07605": "2024-11-12, **Measures of luminous and dark matter in galaxies across time**, Jonathan Freundlich et.al., [2411.07605v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07605v1)\n\n Dark matter is one of the pillars of the current standard model of structure formation: it is assumed to constitute most of the matter in the Universe. However, it can so far only be probed indirectly through its gravitational effects, and its nature remains elusive. In this focus meeting, we discussed different methods used to estimate galaxies' visible and dark matter masses in the nearby and distant Universe. We reviewed successes of the standard model relying on cold dark matter, confronted observations with simulations, and highlighted inconsistencies between the two. We discussed how robust mass measurements can help plan, perform, and refine particle dark matter searches.

Since their results were derived using the indirect abundance matching method, we further investigate the connection between halo properties and central galaxy morphology using weak gravitational lensing.

Furthermore, disabling jet-mode active galactic nuclei feedback in SIMBA simulations results in the disappearance of the positive \\(n-M\\_h\\) relationship, suggesting that the star formation history influenced by black holes may be a contributing factor.\n\n", "2411.07509": "2024-11-12, **A halo model approach for mock catalogs of time-variable strong gravitational lenses**, Katsuya T. Abe et.al., [2411.07509v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07509v1)\n\n Time delays in both galaxy- and cluster-scale strong gravitational lenses have recently attracted a lot of attention in the context of the Hubble tension. Future wide-field cadenced surveys, such as the LSST, are anticipated to discover strong lenses across various scales. We generate mock catalogs of strongly lensed QSOs and SNe on galaxy-, group-, and cluster-scales based on a halo model that incorporates dark matter halos, galaxies, and subhalos. For the upcoming LSST survey, we predict that approximately 3500 lensed QSOs and 200 lensed SNe with resolved multiple images will be discovered. Among these, about 80 lensed QSOs and 10 lensed SNe will have maximum image separations larger than 10 arcsec, which roughly correspond to cluster-scale strong lensing. We find that adopting the Chabrier stellar IMF instead of the fiducial Salpeter IMF reduces the predicted number of strong lenses approximately by half, while the distributions of lens and source redshifts and image separations are not significantly changed. In addition to mock catalogs of multiple-image lens systems, we create mock catalogs of highly magnified systems, including both multiple-image and single-image systems. We find that such highly magnified systems are typically produced by massive galaxies, but non-negligible fraction of them are located in the outskirt of galaxy groups and clusters. Furthermore, we compare subsamples of our mock catalogs with lensed QSO samples constructed from the SDSS and Gaia to find that our mock catalogs with the fiducial Salpeter IMF reproduce the observation quite well. In contrast, our mock catalogs with the Chabrier IMF predict a significantly smaller number of lensed QSOs compared with observations, which adds evidence that the stellar IMF of massive galaxies is Salpeter-like. Our python code SL-Hammocks as well as the mock catalogs are made available online.

The seven symmetry axes intersect close to the explosion site, forming a point-symmetrical structure. We explain the bays as clumps that move slower than the low-density ejecta that the pulsar accelerated. Jittering jets that exploded the Crab formed the clumps during the explosion process.
