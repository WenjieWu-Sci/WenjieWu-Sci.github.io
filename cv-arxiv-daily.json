Addressing this issue is necessary for accurate modeling of neutrino transport in core-collapse supernova and binary neutron star merger. Recent numerical simulations of FFC have shown, however, that the quasi-steady state is sensitively dependent on boundary conditions in space, and the physical reason for the dependence is not clear at present. In this study, we provide a physical interpretation of this issue based on arguments with stability and conservation laws. The stability can be determined by the disappearance of ELN(electron neutrino-lepton number)-XLN(heavy-leptonic one) angular crossings, and we also highlight two conserved quantities characterizing the quasi-steady state of FFC: (1) lepton number conservation along each neutrino trajectory and (2) conservation law associated with angular moments, depending on boundary conditions, for each flavor of neutrinos. We demonstrate that neutrino distributions in quasi-steady states can be determined in an analytic way regardless of boundary conditions, which are in good agreement with numerical simulations.

Including the effect of neutrino oscillations for the upward-going component that travels through the Earth, we find that across the solar cycle the amplitude of time variation is about $\\pm5\\%$ at DUNE, and $\\pm 1\\%$ at HK. At DUNE, the ratio of up/down-going events ranges from 0.45 to 0.85, while at HK, it ranges from 0.75 to 1.5.

This measurement will provide an extremely sensitive test for flavor dependence in the modification of nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs) for neutron-rich nuclei. A measurement of the flavor dependence will provide new and vital information and help to explain nucleon modification at the quark level. In addition to helping understand the origin of the EMC effect, a flavor-dependent nuclear pdf modification could significantly impact a range of processes, including neutrino-nucleus scattering, nuclear Drell-Yan processes, and e-A observables at the Electron-Ion Collider.   The parity-violating asymmetry APV from $^{48}$Ca using an 11 GeV beam at $80\\ \\mu A$ will be measured using the SoLID detector in its PVDIS configuration. In 68 days of data taking, we will reach $0.7-1.3\\%$ statistical precision for $0.2<x<0.7$ with $0.6-0.7\\% $ systematic uncertainties. The goal is to make the first direct measurement of the flavor dependence of the EMC effect.

At mass accretion rates above $\\sim 10^{19}\\,{\\rm g\\,s^{-1}}$, accretion columns are expected to be advective. Under such conditions, a noticeable part of the total energy release can be carried away by neutrinos of a MeV energy range. Relying on a simple model of the neutrino luminosity of accreting strongly magnetised neutron stars, we estimate the neutrino energy fluxes expected from six ULX pulsars known up to date and three brightest Be X-ray transits hosting magnetised neutron stars. Despite the large neutrino luminosity expected in ULX pulsars, the neutrino energy flux from the Be X-ray transients of our Galaxy, SMC and LMC is dominant. However, the neutrino flux from the brightest X-ray transients is estimated to be below the isotropic background by two orders of magnitude at least, which makes impossible direct registration of neutrino emission from accreting strongly magnetised neutron stars nowadays.\n\n", "2304.04513": "2023-04-10, **Chiral perturbative relation for neutrino masses in the type-I seesaw mechanism**, Masaki J.

A future same-sign muon collider is an ideal platform to search for Majorana neutrinos through the Lepton Number Violation process. Specifically, this t-channel kind of process is less kinematically suppressed and has a good advantage in probing Majorana neutrinos at high mass regions up to 10 TeV.

The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory seems to have overcome this difficulty, thereby providing the first compelling example of an extension of general relativity able to successfully challenge the particle dark matter hypothesis.

We find the existence of three distinct gravitational regimes, that is, Newtonian, MOND and a third regime characterised by the presence of oscillations in the gravitational potential which do not exist in the traditional MOND paradigm. We identify the transition scales between these three regimes and discuss their dependence on the boundary conditions and other parameters in the theory. Aided by analytical and numerical solutions, we explore the dependence of these solutions on the theory parameters.

In response to this discovery, a new RMF model, \"NITR\" has been developed.

Subsequently, the NITR model equation of state (EOS) is employed to obtain the properties of a dark matter admixed neutron star using two approaches: non-gravitational (single fluid) and two-fluid. In the two-fluid model, the dark matter (DM) particles only interact with each other via gravity rather than the nucleons. In both cases, the equation of state becomes softer due to DM interactions, which reduces various macroscopic properties such as maximum mass, radius, tidal deformability, etc. Additionally, through the use of various observational data, efforts are made to constraint the quantity of DM within the NS.\n\n", "2304.04990": "2023-04-11, **Future Constraints on Dark Matter with Gravitationally Lensed Fast Radio Bursts Detected by BURSTT**, Simon C. -C.

A very interesting candidate is primordial black holes (PBHs; Carr2016). For the mass ranges of $< 10^{-16} M\\_{\\odot}$ and $> 100 M\\_{\\odot}$, PBHs have been ruled out.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond flashes of radio light of unknown origin mostly from outside the Milky Way.

Up to now, the most successful project in finding FRBs has been CHIME. Due to its large field of view (FoV), CHIME is detecting at least 600 FRBs since 2018. However, none of them is confirmed to be gravitationally lensed (Leung et al. 2022). Taiwan plans to build a new telescope, BURSTT dedicated to detecting FRBs. Its survey area will be 25 times greater than CHIME. BURSTT can localize all of these FRBs through very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We estimate the probability to find gravitationally lensed FRBs, based on the scaled redshift distribution from the latest CHIME catalog and the lensing probability function from Mu\\~noz et al.

This model displaces the dark matter particles without knowing whether they belong to a halo and allows for self-calibration of the model parameters, which are inferred from the data.

In our measurements to characterize the JPA we have found the added noise to the system with a JPA as the first-stage amplifier to be lower than 110 mK at the frequencies from 0.938 GHz to 0.963 GHz.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2304.05013": "2023-04-11, **Nitrogen pollution by metal enriched supermassive stars**, Chris Nagele et.al., [2304.05013v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05013v1)\n\n GN-z11 is an unusually luminous high redshift galaxy which was recently observed to have strong nitrogen lines while at the same time lacking traditional signatures of AGN activity. These observations have been interpreted as a super-solar nitrogen abundance which is challenging to explain with standard stellar evolution and supernovae enrichment. We present simulations of four models of metal enriched supermassive stars after the zero age main sequence which produce super-solar nitrogen consistent with the observations of GN-z11. We then show that the most massive model ends its life in a violent explosion which results in even greater nitrogen pollution.\n\n", "2304.04973": "2023-04-11, **CM Mic and other ER UMa stars showing standstills**, Taichi Kato et.al., [2304.04973v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04973v1)\n\n We analyzed All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations of CM Mic and found that this object belongs to a small group of ER UMa stars showing standstills. In addition to typical ER UMa-type cycles, the object showed standstills between 2017 and 2019 July, and in 2022. The supercycles varied between 49 and 83 d. In 2015, the object showed outbursts with a cycle length of ~35 d. An analysis of TESS observations during the 2020 July outburst detected superhumps with a mean period of 0.080251(6) d (value after the full development of superhumps). We also studied other ER UMa stars showing standstills mainly using Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data. DDE 48, MGAB-V728 and ZTF18abmpkbj mostly showed ER UMa-type supercycles but showed one or two standstills. MGAB-V3488 was mostly in ER UMa states with short (~25 d) supercycles in 2020-2022 similar to RZ LMi. This object also showed long standstills. PS1-3PI J181732.65+101954.6 showed ER UMa-type supercycles up to 2020 May and entered a long standstill. ZTF18abncpgs showed standstills most of the time, but also showed ER UMa-type supercycles occasionally between standstills. ZTF19aarsljl is a likely member of this group. MGAB-V284 showed a pattern similar to ER UMa stars showing standstills but with a longer time-scale of normal outbursts. This object seems to be an ER UMa star with standstills above the period gap. None of the objects we studied showed a superoutburst arising from a long standstill, as recorded in NY Ser in 2018, although the 2019 June-July superoutburst of PS1-3PI J181732.65+101954.6 might have been an exception.\n\n"}}
