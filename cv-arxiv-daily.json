But their lifetimes are likely long, even when shortened by new physics, so decay likely impacts neutrinos only during long trips. This makes high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, traveling for up to billions of light-years, sensitive probes of decay. However, their sensitivity must be tempered by reality. We derive from them thorough bounds on the neutrino lifetimes accounting for critical astrophysical unknowns and the nuances of neutrino detection. Using the diffuse neutrino flux, we disfavor lifetimes $\\tau \\lesssim 20$-450 s $(m/{\\rm eV})$, based on present IceCube data, and forecast factor-of-10 improvements by upcoming detectors. Using, for the first time, neutrinos from the active galaxy NGC 1068, extant unknowns preclude placing lifetime bounds today, but upcoming detectors could disfavor $\\tau \\sim 100$-5000 s $(m/{\\rm eV})$.\n\n", "2405.14764": "2024-05-23, **Multi-Messenger Emission Characteristics of Blazars**, Ronald Gamble Jr et.al., [2405.14764v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14764v1)\n\n Multi-Messenger observations and theory of astrophysical objects is fast becoming a critical research area in the astrophysics scientific community. In particular, point-like objects like that of BL Lac, flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ), and blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCU) are of distinct interest among those who look at the synchrotron, Compton, neutrino, and cosmic ray emissions sourced from compact objects. Notably, there is also much interest in the correlation between multi-frequency observations of blazars and neutrino surveys on source demographics. In this review we look at such multi-frequency and multi-physics correlations of the radio, X-ray, and $\\gamma$-ray fluxes of different classes of blazars from a collection of survey catalogues. This multi-physics survey of blazars shows that there are characteristic cross-correlations in the spectra of blazars when considering their multi-frequency and multi-messenger emission.

Virtual pion--nucleon charge exchange interactions are investigated as the source for induced isotensor interactions, giving rise to the Majorana DCE (MDCE) reaction mechanism. MDCE is of a generic character, proceeding through pairs of complementary ($\\pi^\\pm,\\pi^\\mp$) reactions in the projectile and target nucleus. The dynamics of the elementary processes is discussed, where the excitation of pion--nucleon resonances are of central importance. Investigations of initial and final state ion--ion interactions show that these effects are acting as vertex renormalizations. In closure approximation, well justified by the finite pion mass, the second-order transition matrix elements reduce to pion potentials and effective two-body isotensor DCE interactions, giving rise also to two-body correlations in either of the participating nuclei.

Detecting globular clusters in the Euclid survey**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2405.14015v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14015v1)\n\n Extragalactic globular clusters (EGCs) are an abundant and powerful tracer of galaxy dynamics and formation, and their own formation and evolution is also a matter of extensive debate. The compact nature of globular clusters means that they are hard to spatially resolve and thus study outside the Local Group. In this work we have examined how well EGCs will be detectable in images from the Euclid telescope, using both simulated pre-launch images and the first early-release observations of the Fornax galaxy cluster. The Euclid Wide Survey will provide high-spatial resolution VIS imaging in the broad IE band as well as near-infrared photometry (YE, JE, and HE). We estimate that the galaxies within 100 Mpc in the footprint of the Euclid survey host around 830 000 EGCs of which about 350 000 are within the survey's detection limits. For about half of these EGCs, three infrared colours will be available as well. For any galaxy within 50Mpc the brighter half of its GC luminosity function will be detectable by the Euclid Wide Survey. The detectability of EGCs is mainly driven by the residual surface brightness of their host galaxy. We find that an automated machine-learning EGC-classification method based on real Euclid data of the Fornax galaxy cluster provides an efficient method to generate high purity and high completeness GC candidate catalogues. We confirm that EGCs are spatially resolved compared to pure point sources in VIS images of Fornax. Our analysis of both simulated and first on-sky data show that Euclid will increase the number of GCs accessible with high-resolution imaging substantially compared to previous surveys, and will permit the study of GCs in the outskirts of their hosts.

Owing to the non-relativistic nature of dark matter and the typical variational scale of the Earth's ionosphere, the standard linearized approach to computing dark matter conversion is not suitable. We therefore solve a second-order boundary-value problem, effectively framing the ionosphere as a driven cavity filled with a positionally-varying plasma. An electrically-small dipole antenna targeting the generated radio waves can be orders of magnitude more sensitive to dark photon and axion-like particle dark matter in the relevant mass range.

Within these models, we identify two distinct phases of particle production: during and after inflation. During inflation, we derive an accurate analytic expression for the particle production rate, accounting for a varying Hubble rate. After inflation, the additional burst of particle production depends on the inflaton mass around its minimum. When this mass is smaller than the Hubble scale during inflation, $H\\_I$, there is no significant extra production.

Therefore, finding new gravitational wave signatures associated with this dark matter candidate can either lead to their detection or help constraining their abundance. In this work we consider the phenomenology of primordial black holes in dense environments, in particular globular clusters. We model the internal structure of globular clusters in a semi-analytical fashion, and we derive the expected merger rate.

The deeper VIS imaging compared to NISP means we can routinely identify high-redshift Lyman breaks of the order of $3$ magnitudes, which reduces contamination by brown dwarf stars and low-redshift galaxies. Spectroscopic follow-up campaigns of such bright sources will help constrain both the bright end of the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function and the quasar luminosity function at $z>6$, and constrain the physical nature of these objects.

The NISP Calibration Unit**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2405.13494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13494v1)\n\n The near-infrared calibration unit (NI-CU) onboard Euclid's Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) is the first astronomical calibration lamp based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to be operated in space. Euclid is a mission in ESA's 'Cosmic Vision 2015-2025' framework, to explore the dark universe and provide a next-level characterisation of the nature of gravitation, dark matter, and dark energy. Calibrating photometric and spectrometric measurements of galaxies to better than 1.5% accuracy in a survey homogeneously mapping ~14000 deg^2 of extragalactic sky requires a very detailed characterisation of near-infrared (NIR) detector properties, as well their constant monitoring in flight. To cover two of the main contributions - relative pixel-to-pixel sensitivity and non-linearity characteristics - as well as support other calibration activities, NI-CU was designed to provide spatially approximately homogeneous (<12% variations) and temporally stable illumination (0.1%-0.2% over 1200s) over the NISP detector plane, with minimal power consumption and energy dissipation. NI-CU is covers the spectral range ~[900,1900] nm - at cryo-operating temperature - at 5 fixed independent wavelengths to capture wavelength-dependent behaviour of the detectors, with fluence over a dynamic range of >=100 from ~15 ph s^-1 pixel^-1 to >1500 ph s^-1 pixel^-1. For this functionality, NI-CU is based on LEDs. We describe the rationale behind the decision and design process, describe the challenges in sourcing the right LEDs, as well as the qualification process and lessons learned. We also provide a description of the completed NI-CU, its capabilities and performance as well as its limits. NI-CU has been integrated into NISP and the Euclid satellite, and since Euclid's launch in July 2023 has started supporting survey operations.\n\n", "2405.13493": "2024-05-22, **Euclid. III. The NISP Instrument**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2405.13493v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13493v1)\n\n The Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) on board the Euclid satellite provides multiband photometry and R>=450 slitless grism spectroscopy in the 950-2020nm wavelength range. In this reference article we illuminate the background of NISP's functional and calibration requirements, describe the instrument's integral components, and provide all its key properties. We also sketch the processes needed to understand how NISP operates and is calibrated, and its technical potentials and limitations. Links to articles providing more details and technical background are included. NISP's 16 HAWAII-2RG (H2RG) detectors with a plate scale of 0.3\" pix^-1 deliver a field-of-view of 0.57deg^2. In photo mode, NISP reaches a limiting magnitude of ~24.5AB mag in three photometric exposures of about 100s exposure time, for point sources and with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 5. For spectroscopy, NISP's point-source sensitivity is a SNR = 3.5 detection of an emission line with flux ~2x10^-16erg/s/cm^2 integrated over two resolution elements of 13.4A, in 3x560s grism exposures at 1.6 mu (redshifted Ha). Our calibration includes on-ground and in-flight characterisation and monitoring of detector baseline, dark current, non-linearity, and sensitivity, to guarantee a relative photometric accuracy of better than 1.5%, and relative spectrophotometry to better than 0.7%. The wavelength calibration must be better than 5A. NISP is the state-of-the-art instrument in the NIR for all science beyond small areas available from HST and JWST - and an enormous advance due to its combination of field size and high throughput of telescope and instrument. During Euclid's 6-year survey covering 14000 deg^2 of extragalactic sky, NISP will be the backbone for determining distances of more than a billion galaxies. Its NIR data will become a rich reference imaging and spectroscopy data set for the coming decades.\n\n", "2405.13492": "2024-05-22, **Euclid. II. The VIS Instrument**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2405.13492v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13492v1)\n\n This paper presents the specification, design, and development of the Visible Camera (VIS) on the ESA Euclid mission. VIS is a large optical-band imager with a field of view of 0.54 deg^2 sampled at 0.1\" with an array of 609 Megapixels and spatial resolution of 0.18\". It will be used to survey approximately 14,000 deg^2 of extragalactic sky to measure the distortion of galaxies in the redshift range z=0.1-1.5 resulting from weak gravitational lensing, one of the two principal cosmology probes of Euclid. With photometric redshifts, the distribution of dark matter can be mapped in three dimensions, and, from how this has changed with look-back time, the nature of dark energy and theories of gravity can be constrained. The entire VIS focal plane will be transmitted to provide the largest images of the Universe from space to date, reaching m\\_AB>24.5 with S/N >10 in a single broad I\\_E~(r+i+z) band over a six year survey. The particularly challenging aspects of the instrument are the control and calibration of observational biases, which lead to stringent performance requirements and calibration regimes. With its combination of spatial resolution, calibration knowledge, depth, and area covering most of the extra-Galactic sky, VIS will also provide a legacy data set for many other fields. This paper discusses the rationale behind the VIS concept and describes the instrument design and development before reporting the pre-launch performance derived from ground calibrations and brief results from the in-orbit commissioning. VIS should reach fainter than m\\_AB=25 with S/N>10 for galaxies of full-width half-maximum of 0.3\" in a 1.3\" diameter aperture over the Wide Survey, and m\\_AB>26.4 for a Deep Survey that will cover more than 50 deg^2.

Here we present the discovery in NEOWISE data of WTP19aalnxx, a luminous mid-infrared (IR) transient in the outskirts of the galaxy KUG 0022-007 at $\\approx 190$ Mpc. First detected in 2018, WTP19aalnxx reaches a peak absolute (Vega) magnitude of $\\approx-22$ at $4.6 \\, \\mu$m in $\\approx3$ yr, comparable to the most luminous interacting SNe. Archival data reveal a $\\gtrsim 5\\times$ fainter optical counterpart detected since 2015, while follow-up near-IR observations in 2022 reveal an extremely red ($Ks-W2 \\approx 3.7$ mag) active transient.

Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution, we estimate the presence of $\\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ M$\\_\\odot$ of warm dust, likely formed in the shock interaction region. Together with the lack of nebular Fe emission, we suggest that WTP19aalnxx is a missed, low (optical) luminosity SN in an emerging family of core-collapse SNe distinguished by their CSM-interaction-powered mid-IR emission that outshines the optical bands. Investigating the Zwicky Transient Facility sample of SNe in NEOWISE data, we find $17$ core-collapse SNe ($\\gtrsim 3$% in a volume-limited sample) without early signs of CSM interaction that exhibit delayed IR brightening, suggestive of dense CSM shells at $\\lesssim 10^{17}$cm.

Notably, the angular diameter distance (ADD) to each galaxy cluster in the samples is determined by combining its gas mass fraction measurement with galaxy clustering observations, more precisely, the $\\Omega\\_b / \\Omega\\_m$ ratio. Such a combination results in a $H\\_0$ estimate that is independent of a specific cosmological framework.

An emerging class of supernovae with the highest degree of envelope-stripping are thought to be the product of stripping by a NS companion. However, relatively few examples are known and the outcomes of such systems can be diverse and are poorly understood at present. Here, we present spectroscopic observations and high cadence multi-band photometry of SN 2023zaw, a low ejecta mass and rapidly evolving supernova. SN 2023zaw was discovered in a nearby spiral galaxy at D = 39.7 Mpc, with significant Milky Way extinction, $E(B-V) = 0.21$, and significant (but uncertain) host extinction.

We use this data, together with other distance probes, to constrain the cosmic expansion history using some well-motivated physical classes of dark energy. In particular, we explore three physics-focused behaviors of dark energy from the equation of state and energy density perspectives: the thawing class (matching many simple quintessence potentials), emergent class (where dark energy comes into being recently, as in phase transition models), and mirage class (where phenomenologically the distance to CMB last scattering is close to that from a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ despite dark energy dynamics). All three classes fit the data at least as well as $\\Lambda$CDM, and indeed can improve on it by $\\Delta\\chi^2\\approx -5$ to $-17$ for the combination of DESI BAO with CMB and supernova data, while having one more parameter.
