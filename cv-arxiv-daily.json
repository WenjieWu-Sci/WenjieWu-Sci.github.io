GRANDlib is an open-source software tool designed to meet these challenges. Its primary goal is to perform end-to-end simulations of the detector operation, from the interaction of ultra-high-energy particles, through -- by interfacing with external air-shower simulations -- the ensuing particle shower development and its radio emission, to its detection by antenna arrays and its processing by data-acquisition systems. Additionally, GRANDlib manages the visualization, storage, and retrieval of experimental and simulated data.

Much like the detector itself, the presented instrumentation is composed of modular arrays that can be scaled up and easily serviced. A single such array can carry up to 30 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) accompanied by electronics that generate high voltage in-situ and deliver time resolution of up to 0.69 ns. In addition, the technology is compatible with the White Rabbit timing system, which can synchronize its elements to within 100 ps.

When compactified to four dimensions, Yukawa couplings, initially expressed as modular forms with mass dimensions, are normalized to conform to canonical four-dimensional theory, with the Yukawa coefficients being complex numbers of unit absolute value. We show that this model naturally explains the mass and mixing hierarchies of quarks and leptons, solves the strong CP problem, provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem, and can inherently satisfy no axionic domain-wall problem. The $U(1)\\_X$ mixed gravitational anomaly-free condition necessitates that electrically neutral mirror bulk fermions couple to the normal neutrino field on the 3-brane, consistent with the boundary condition. Consequently, we demonstrate a mechanism for generating light neutrino masses, similar to the Weinberg operator, by transmitting the information of $U(1)\\_X$ breakdown between the two 3-branes. The scale of $U(1)\\_X$ breaking is estimated from neutrino data to be around $10^{15}$ GeV, leading to a QCD axion mass of approximately $2.5\\times10^{-9}$ eV.

Recent observations by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed a dominant galaxy population at high redshifts ($z>2$) that were visually classified as discs for their flattened shapes and/or exponential light profiles. The extensively accepted interpretation is that they are dynamically cold discs supported by bulk rotation. However, it is long known that flattened shapes and exponential profiles are not exclusive for rotating disc structure.

While these local star-forming low-mass galaxies are photometrically similar to real dynamically cold discs, they are not supported by ordered rotation but primarily by random motion, and their flattened shapes result largely from tangential orbital anisotropy. Given the empirical and theoretical evidence that young galaxies are dynamically hotter at higher redshifts, our results suggest that the high-$z$ JWST galaxies may not be cold discs but are dynamically warm/hot galaxies with flattened shapes driven by anisotropy. While both having low rotational support, local low-mass galaxies possess oblate shapes, contrasting the prolate shapes (i.e. cigar-like) of low-mass systems at high redshifts.

We find that dwarf galaxies often form their stars \"inside-out,\" i.e., the stars form at successively larger radii over time. However, the oldest stars get reshuffled beyond the star forming radius by fluctuations in the gravitational potential well caused by stellar feedback (the same mechanisms that cause dwarfs to form dark matter cores). The result is that many dwarfs appear to have an \"outside-in\" age gradient at $z=0$, with younger stellar populations more centrally concentrated. However, for the reshuffled galaxies with the most extended star formation, young stars can form out to the large radii to which the old stars have been reshuffled, erasing the age gradient. We find that major mergers do not play a significant role in setting the age gradients of dwarfs. We find similar age gradient trends in satellites and field dwarfs, suggesting environment plays only a minor role, if any. Finally, we find that the age gradient trends are imprinted on the galaxies at later times, suggesting that the stellar reshuffling dominates after the galaxies have formed 50% of their stellar mass. The later reshuffling is at odds with results from the FIRE-2 simulations. Hence, age gradients offer a test of current star formation and feedback models that can be probed via observations of resolved stellar populations.\n\n", "2408.10358": "2024-08-19, **The All-Sky Impact of the LMC on the Milky Way Circumgalactic Medium**, Christopher Carr et.al., [2408.10358v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10358v1)\n\n The first infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) represents a large and recent disruption to the MW circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this work, we use idealized, hydrodynamical simulations of a MW-like CGM embedded in a live dark matter halo with an infalling LMC-like satellite initialized with its own CGM to understand how the encounter is shaping the global physical and kinematic properties of the MW CGM.

Additionally, the numerical study of the GRS 1915+105 source, which exhibits continuous variability in X-ray observations, along with its physical properties and mechanisms behind Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) frequencies, can contribute to observational studies. Motivated by this, we examine the variations in physical mechanisms around the non-rotating Horndeski black hole with Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion related to the scalar hair parameter and the resulting QPO frequencies. With a decrease in the scalar hair parameter, the shock cone opening angle narrows due to the influence of the scalar field potential, and the stagnation point within the cone moves closer to the black hole horizon. With the changing scalar hair parameter, the simultaneous formation of the shock cone and bow shock is observed. Due to the intense increase in scalar potential, both the shock cone and bow shock disappeared, and a cavity surrounding the black hole forms in the area where the shock cone was. Additionally, QPO oscillations induced by the physical mechanisms observed in relation to the hair parameter are revealed through numerical simulations. A broad range of QPO frequencies is observed, from low to high frequencies, with resonance states like 3:2 occurring.

At $z = 0$, Auriga disc galaxies tend to exhibit higher specific angular momenta compared to their cross-matched Apostle counterparts. By tracing the evolution history of the Lagrangian mass tracers of the in-situ star particles in the $z = 0$ galaxies, we find that the specific angular momentum distributions of the gas tracers from the two simulations at the halo accretion time are relatively similar. The present-day angular momentum difference is mainly driven by the physical processes occurring inside dark matter haloes, especially galactic fountains. Due to the different subgrid implementations of stellar feedback processes, Auriga galaxies contain a high fraction of recycled gas tracers (${\\sim} 65$ per cent) which could acquire angular momentum through mixing with the high angular momentum circumgalactic medium (CGM).

The dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation (D6) is the double detonation of the more massive WD in a binary WD system where the localized impact of the mass transfer stream from the companion sets off the initial helium shell detonation. To have high numerical resolution and control over the stream parameters, we have implemented a study of the local interaction of the stream with the WD surface in 2D. In cases with lower base density of the shell, the stream's impact can cause surface detonation soon after first impact. With higher base densities, after the stream hits the surface, hot material flows around the star and interacts with the incoming stream to produce a denser and narrower impact. Our results therefore show that (1) a directly impacting stream for both a relatively high resolution and for a range of stream parameters can produce a surface detonation, (2) thinner helium shells ignite more promptly via impact, doing so sooner, and (3) there are lower limits on ignition in both shell density and incoming stream speed with lower limits on density being well below those shown by other work to be required for normal appearing SN Ia. This supports stream ignition and therefore the D6 scenario, as a viable mechanism for normal SNe Ia.\n\n", "2408.10721": "2024-08-20, **Viewing the explosion models of type Ia supernovae via the insight from terrestrial cellular detonation**, Kazuya Iwata et.al., [2408.10721v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10721v1)\n\n The cellular structure is considered to be a key as a criterion in initiation, propagation, and quenching of terrestrial detonation. While a few studies on type Ia supernovae, which are known to involve detonation, have addressed the importance of the cellular structure, further detailed treatment will benefit enhanced understanding of the explosion outcomes. In the present study, we bridge this gap in the astrophysics and engineering fields, focusing on the detonation in a heliumrich white dwarf envelope as the triggering process for the so-called double-detonation model. The cellular structures are quantified via high-resolution two-dimensional simulations. We demonstrate that widely-accepted terrestrial-experimental criteria for quenching and initiation of detonation can indeed explain the results of previous hydrodynamic simulations very well. The present study highlights the potential of continuing to apply the insight from terrestrial detonation experiments to astrophysical problems, specifically the long unresolved problem of the explosion mechanism of type Ia supernovae.\n\n", "2408.10707": "2024-08-20, **High-redshift Cosmology by Gamma-Ray Bursts: an overview**, Giada Bargiacchi et.al., [2408.10707v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10707v1)\n\n Several correlations among Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) quantities, both in the prompt and afterglow emissions, have been established during the last decades, thus enabling the standardization of GRBs as cosmological probes. Since GRBs are observed up to redshift $z \\sim 9$, they represent a valuable tool to fill in the gap of information on the Universe evolution between the farthest type Ia supernovae and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation and to shed new light on the current challenging cosmological tensions. Without claiming for completeness, here we describe the state of the art of GRB correlations, their theoretical interpretations, and their cosmological applications both as standalone probes and in combination with other probes. In this framework, we pinpoint the importance of correcting the correlations for selection biases and redshift evolution to derive intrinsic relations, the assets of combining probes at different scales, and the need for the employment of the appropriate cosmological likelihood to precisely constrain cosmological parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize the benefits of the cosmographic approach to avoid any cosmological assumptions and the valuable applications of machine learning techniques to reconstruct GRB light curves and predict unknown GRB redshifts. Finally, we stress the relevance of all these factors, along with future observations, to definitely boost the power of GRBs in cosmology.\n\n", "2408.10704": "2024-08-20, **$\u039b$CDM model against cosmography: A possible deviation after DESI 2024**, Saeed Pourojaghi et.al., [2408.10704v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10704v1)\n\n In this study, we present an analysis of the standard flat-$\\Lambda$CDM model using a cosmographic approach, incorporating recent DESI BAO observations and Supernovae Type Ia catalogues (SNIa), including the DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+ compilations. We find full consistency between the standard model and the cosmographic approach when considering DESI BAO and SNIa catalogues independently. When combining DESI BAO with SNIa data, we examine the impact of the Planck prior on the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r\\_d$, and the Cepheid prior on the absolute magnitude, $M$. Applying the Planck prior on $r\\_d$ alone yields an $H\\_0$ value consistent with the Planck measurement, while applying the Cepheid prior on $M$ alone results in an $H\\_0$ value consistent with the SH0ES measurement. Without any priors, the $H\\_0$ value obtained has a large error margin, reconciling the Planck and SH0ES measurements. In all cases where individual priors are applied, we observe no significant tension between the flat-$\\Lambda$CDM model and the cosmographic approach. However, when both Planck and Cepheid priors are applied simultaneously, significant tensions arise between the model and cosmography. This tension is even more pronounced when excluding LRG1 and LRG2 from the DESI measurements. These results suggest that the standard model cannot simultaneously align with both high-redshift Planck CMB observations and local Cepheid measurements.\n\n", "2408.10560": "2024-08-20, **Optimizing the $L$-$\u03c3$ Relation of HII Galaxies for Improving Cosmological Application**, Jiaze Gao et.al., [2408.10560v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10560v1)\n\n The basic premise of using HII starburst galaxies (HIIGs) as cosmic \"standard candels\" is that there is a significant correlation between the H$\\beta$ luminosity ($L$) and the velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) of the ionized gas from HIIGs measurements, which can be called as the empirical $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation. However, the scaling $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation well-calibrated with the lower-redshift HIIGs is unfitted for the higher-redshift HIIGs. To solve this problem, we explore new relational expression for the $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation which should be suitable for both lower-redshift and higher-redshift HIIGs. After reconstructing the Hubble diagram with the Gaussian process (GP) method from the Pantheon+ supernovae Ia sample, we examine and compare six different revised formulas of $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation. Furthermore, we use the Bayesian evidence to compare the revised $L$ - $\\sigma$ relations with the analysis of a joint sample of 36 giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHRs) and 145 HIIGs. It turns out that the redshift-dependent bilinear correction and the quadratic $\\sigma$ based correction are significantly better than the others. Moreover, a quadratic $\\sigma$ based correction is the most supported one. It suggests that the appropriate corrections to the $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation should be considered when the HIIGs are used as a kind of cosmological probes.\n\n", "2408.10449": "2024-08-19, **SAUNAS II: Discovery of Cross-shaped X-ray Emission and a Rotating Circumnuclear Disk in the Supermassive S0 Galaxy NGC 5084**, Alejandro S.

The spectral energy distribution lacks strong emission lines in the optical range.   Three formation scenarios are considered to explain these multi-wavelength archival observations: 1) AGN re-orientation caused by accretion of surrounding material, 2) AGN-driven hot gas outflow directed along the galactic minor axis, or 3) a starburst / supernovae driven outflow at the core of the galaxy.

When these objects are turned into black holes due to a supernova or a binary merger this ''hair'' could be ''shorn'' off. Part of the field configuration would then be released leading to an outgoing field wave. For small masses this field transient remains rather compact and can induce a transient signal in experiments, in particular those that look for wave-like dark matter. This signal can be correlated with the corresponding astrophysical signal of the event. In this note, we consider a variety of couplings and the associated signals and estimate the corresponding sensitivities.\n\n", "2408.09645": "2024-08-19, **[O II] as an Effective Indicator of the Dependence Between the Standardised Luminosities of Type Ia Supernovae and the Properties of their Host Galaxies**, B. Martin et.al., [2408.09645v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09645v1)\n\n We have obtained IFU spectra of 75 SN Ia host galaxies from the Foundation Supernova survey to search for correlations between the properties of individual galaxies and SN Hubble residuals. After standard corrections for light-curve width and SN colour have been applied, we find correlations between Hubble residuals and the equivalent width of the [O II] $\\lambda\\lambda$ 3727, 3729 doublet (2.3$\\sigma$), an indicator of the specific star formation rate (sSFR). When splitting our sample by SN colour, we find no colour dependence impacting the correlation between EW[O II] and Hubble residual. However, when splitting by colour, we reveal a correlation between the Hubble residuals of blue SNe Ia and the Balmer decrement (2.2$\\sigma$), an indicator of dust attenuation. These correlations remain after applying a mass-step correction, suggesting that the mass-step correction does not fully account for the limitations of the colour correction used to standardise SNe Ia. Rather than a mass correction, we apply a correction to SNe from star forming galaxies based on their measurable EW[O II]. We find that this correction also removes the host galaxy mass step, while also greatly reducing the significance of the correlation with the Balmer decrement for blue SNe Ia. We find that correcting for EW[O II], in addition to or in place of the mass-step, may further reduce the scatter in the Hubble diagram.\n\n"}}
