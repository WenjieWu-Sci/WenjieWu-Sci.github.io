Moreover, the detection of very-high-energy (VHE) neutrinos could potentially bring constraints on ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) source models.

The EAS can be detected by capturing some of the optical Cherenkov signal originating from the EAS particles.

There is growing evidence that some of these neutrinos can be associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN) and especially with blazars. Several recent studies have revealed a statistical correlation between radio-bright AGN samples and IceCube neutrino event catalogs. In addition, a growing number of individual high-energy neutrinos have been found to coincide with individual radio-flaring blazars. These observational results strongly call for high-quality, high angular-resolution radio observations of such neutrino-associated blazars to study their parsec-scale jet structures.

My goal with this dissertation is to explore spin and magnetic moments in \\emph{relativistic} mechanics from both a quantum and classical perspective. We emphasize the special case of gyromagnetic ratio $g\\!=\\!2$ and its relationship to the algebraic spin structure of wave equations. In relativistic quantum mechanics, we investigate generalizations of the Dirac equation for arbitrary magnetic moments for fermions. We analyze the homogeneous magnetic field case and the Coulomb problem for hydrogen-like atoms with emphasis on the role of the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM). We explore alternative approaches which combine mass and the magnetic moment. Classically, we propose a relativistic covariant model of the Stern-Gerlach force via the introduction of a magnetic four-potential. This model modifies the covariant torque equations and unites the Amp\\`erian and Gilbertian models for magnetic moments.   We further study (transition) magnetic dipoles in Majorana neutrinos specifically analyzing the relationship between flavor mixing and electromagnetic (EM) fields. We demonstrate EM flavor mixing explicitly in the 2-flavor model and develop a dynamical mass basis with an EM rotation matrix.

An interesting application of these theoretical developments is to study primordial magnetization in the early universe during the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch.

Many high sensitive experiments, such as neutrino detection, require as low noise as possible. The conventional straight channel MCP is inevitable to introduce the after-pulses, which are the major source of noise. Normally, couple two straight MCPs in cascade and combine the channels into a \"V\" shape can effectively suppress ion-feedback, known as chevron MCPs. However, due to the limitation manufacture technology, the gap always exist. It will worsen the resolution and peak-to-valley ratio. Different with the joint MCPs that is mentioned above, the curved MCPs exhibit superior characteristics. Based on the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation framework, we investigate how the geometrical parameter of curved channel MCP influence the gain. Consequently, when the MCP thickness and operating voltage are fixed, an optimum pore radius exists to reach maximum gain. Additionally, The simulation of electron tracks in MCP channels reveals that the average acceleration distance before incident inner wall is approximately 20 $\\upmu \\mathrm{m}$ for a curved MCP with applied voltage 950 V, length-diameter-ratio 80:1, and pore diameter 20 $\\upmu \\mathrm{m}$\n\n", "2310.07145": "2023-10-11, **Probing self-interacting sterile neutrino dark matter with the diffuse supernova neutrino background**, A.

We show that a cosmologically-significant relic population of keV-mass sterile neutrinos with strong self-interactions could imprint their presence in the DSNB. The signatures of the self-interactions would be \"dips\" in the otherwise smooth DSNB spectrum. Upcoming large-scale neutrino detectors, for example Hyper-Kamiokande, have a good chance of detecting the DSNB and these dips. If no dips are detected, this method serves as an independent constraint on the sterile neutrino self-interaction strength and mixing with active neutrinos. We show that relic sterile neutrino parameters that evade X-ray and structure bounds may nevertheless be testable by future detectors like TRISTAN, but may also produce dips in the DSNB which could be detectable.

Using the EASCherSim optical Cherenkov generation code, we provide an updated estimate of the event rate of above-the-limb cosmic rays for the CT, taking into account updated values for the trigger efficiency as determined during the field testing of the instrument. We take particular care to consider the longitudinal development of EAS in rarefied atmosphere, accounting for the energy dependent elongation rate.

For dark matter with a mass below tens of MeV, photons, electrons, and neutrinos are the only available direct Standard Model annihilation products. Using a full three-sector abundance calculation, we determine the minimal mass of dark matter, allowing for an arbitrary branching into electrons/photons and neutrinos that is compatible with current cosmological observations. The analysis takes into account the heat transfer between the various sectors from annihilation and elastic scattering, representing the first fully self-consistent analysis that tracks the respective sectors' temperatures. We thereby provide accurate thermal annihilation cross sections, particularly for velocity-dependent cases, and deduce the sensitivity of current and upcoming CMB experiments to MeV thermal dark matter. In the latter context, we also establish the fine-tuned parameter region where a tiny admixture of neutrinos in the final states rules in MeV-scale $p$-wave annihilating DM into electrons. Finally, we show that a sub-% millicharged dark matter with an interaction strength that interferes with 21~cm cosmology is still allowed when freeze-out is supplemented with annihilation into neutrinos.

Its primary goals include precision measurements of the neutrino cross section and using the measured neutrino flux both to uncover information about far-forward hadron production and to search for various beyond standard model scenarios. However, these goals have the potential to conflict: extracting information about the flux or cross section relies upon an assumption about the other. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that the FPF can use the low-$\\nu$ method -- a technique for constraining the flux shape by isolating neutrino interactions with low energy transfer to the nucleus -- to break this degeneracy. We show that the low-$\\nu$ method is effective for extracting the $\\nu\\_{\\mu}$ flux shape, in a model-independent way.

Pantheon Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) data is used in our study to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters of this model. In our analysis, we found a cosmic axis of anisotropy using SN1e data. Interestingly this preferred axis lies in the same direction, broadly, as some other cosmic anisotropy axes reported in the literature such as the CMB hemispherical power asymmetry, etc., with some of anisotropic sources considered. We also found a non-zero evidence for cosmic shear and eccentricity for our universe with those sources.

In such processes, tachyonic instabilities arise as a consequence of the coupling to the curvature, greatly enhancing mode production. In this work, we consider a massive vector field that is coupled to the curvature scalar and the Ricci tensor only, and study its gravitational production through inflation and reheating. We show how the mechanism is more efficient than in the case of a non-minimally coupled scalar field, giving rise to larger abundances.

Here, we use the truncated Wigner approximation method to test the classical field approximation of ultra-light dark matter. This method approximates a quantum state as an ensemble of independently evolving realizations drawn from its Wigner function. The method is highly parallelizable and allows the direct simulation of quantum corrections and decoherence times in systems many times larger than have been previously studied in reference to ultra-light dark matter. Our study involves simulation of systems in 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions. We simulate three systems, the condensation of a Gaussian random field in three spatial dimensions, a stable collapsed object in three spatial dimensions, and the merging of two stable objects in two spatial dimensions. We study the quantum corrections to the classical field theory in each case. We find that quantum corrections grow exponentially during nonlinear growth with the timescale being approximately equal to the system dynamical time. In stable systems the corrections grow quadratically. We also find that the primary effect of quantum corrections is to reduce the amplitude of fluctuations on the deBroglie scale in the spatial density. Finally, we find that the timescale associated with decoherence due to gravitational coupling to Baryonic matter is at least as fast as the quantum corrections due to gravitational interactions.

Because of the enhancement of the vacuum nucleation rate around a BH, vacuum nucleation can be triggered only around BHs. If the average number of BHs within one Hubble volume is smaller than unity at the time of bubble nucleation, each bubble catalyzed around them expands to the Hubble size, and the Hubble patches containing BHs transition to the true vacuum, whereas the rest of the universe remains in the false vacuum. Assuming that the vacuum energy difference is negligible in relation to the total energy until a time close to the bubble collision, most false-vacuum patches do not undergo inflation, and the entire universe is eventually filled with true-vacuum bubbles much after BH formation and bubble nucleation. This \"super-slow phase transition\" scenario predicts enhanced gravitational wave signals from bubble collisions and can be tested in future observations. Moreover, a small fraction of the universe remains in the false vacuum and inflates by chance, and the corresponding region can be seen as a BH from an outside observer.

In the second phase, the black hole mass increases rapidly to supermassive scales, which explains the existence of quasars at redshift $z\\ge 6$ and also the recently detected supermassive black hole (SMBH) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Further, we calculate the evolution of the Eddington ratio for growing black holes. The accretion is mostly sub-Eddington except for a short super-Eddington episode when the mass accretion rate transitions from low to high. However, during that episode, the black hole mass is likely inadequate to hinder accretion through radiative feedback.\n\n", "2310.06893": "2023-10-10, **The simplest case of dark inflaxion**, Hansel Gordillo-Ruiz et.al., [2310.06893v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06893v1)\n\n Dark matter and cosmic inflation represent two of the major puzzles in cosmology. They are typically addressed by introducing separate fields with independent dynamics. On the other hand, extra dimensions might play an important role for observable physics. We introduce a five-dimensional model called dark inflaxion that includes an axion-like particle, whose Kaluza-Klein modes can describe inflation and dark matter. We show that a simple yet natural choice of the mass scale of the effective four-dimensional fields of our model can accommodate simultaneously the observable values of inflationary parameters and dark-matter abundance. It will be interesting to explore the consequences and predictions of more generic scenarios within the scope of our model, which include the possibility of multifield inflation and dark matter.\n\n", "2310.06660": "2023-10-10, **Identifying axion conversion in compact star magnetospheres with radio-wave polarization signatures**, Z.

It solves the strong charge conjugation-parity reversal problem CP in fundamental physics and the dark matter problem in astronomy. Its interaction with the electromagnetic field has been expected but never detected experimentally. Such particles may convert to radio waves in the environment with a strong magnetic field. Inspired by the idea, various research groups have been working on theoretical modeling and radio data analysis to search for the signature of radio signals generated by the axion conversion in the magnetosphere of compact stars, where the surface magnetic field as strong as $10^{13}$-$10^{14}$ G is expected. In this work, we calculate the observational properties of the axion-induced radio signals (AIRSs) in the neutron star magnetosphere, where both the total intensity and polarization properties of radio emission are derived. Based on the ray tracing method, assuming 100% linear polarization of radio waves generated in each conversion, we compute the polarization emission profile concerning different viewing angles. We note that plasma and general relativistic effects are important for the polarization properties of AIRSs. Our work suggests that AIRSs can be identified by the narrow bandwidth and distinct polarization features.\n\n", "2310.06882": "2023-10-10, **Understanding the Formation of Galaxies with Warm Dark Matter**, Bruce Hoeneisen et.al., [2310.06882v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06882v1)\n\n The formation of galaxies with warm dark matter is approximately adiabatic.

For each case, we consider bound states composed of either scalar particles with a Yukawa coupling, or vector particles coupled to baryon minus lepton number charge. Accounting for all experimental constraints on coupling strength, we estimate the sensitivity reach of an optomechanical sensor search.

Pantheon Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) data is used in our study to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters of this model. In our analysis, we found a cosmic axis of anisotropy using SN1e data. Interestingly this preferred axis lies in the same direction, broadly, as some other cosmic anisotropy axes reported in the literature such as the CMB hemispherical power asymmetry, etc., with some of anisotropic sources considered. We also found a non-zero evidence for cosmic shear and eccentricity for our universe with those sources.

Its peak magnitude is $M\\_{\\rm g}$ = $-21.2$ mag and its rise time ($\\lesssim 24$ days from first light) place SN 2020zbf among the fastest rising SLSNe-I. Spectra taken from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared wavelengths are used for the identification of spectral features. We pay particular attention to the C II lines as they present distinctive characteristics when compared to other events. We also analyze UV and optical photometric data, and model the light curves considering three different powering mechanisms: radioactive decay of Ni, magnetar spin-down and circumstellar material interaction (CSM). The spectra of SN 2020zbf match well with the model spectra of a C-rich low-mass magnetar model. This is consistent with our light curve modelling which supports a magnetar-powered explosion with a $M\\_{\\rm ej}$ = 1.5 $M\\_\\odot$. However, we cannot discard the CSM-interaction model as it also may reproduce the observed features.

To address this tension, Early Dark Energy (EDE) models have been proposed as alternatives to $\\Lambda$CDM, as they can change the observed sound horizon and the inferred Hubble constant from measurements based on this. In this paper, we investigate the use of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to evaluate EDE as a solution to the H0 tension. BMA consists of assigning a prior to the model and deriving a posterior as for any other unknown parameter in a Bayesian analysis. BMA can be computationally challenging in that one must approximate the joint posterior of both model and parameters. Here we present a computational strategy for BMA that exploits existing MCMC software and combines model-specific posteriors post-hoc. In application to a comprehensive analysis of cosmological datasets, we quantify the impact of EDE on the H0 discrepancy. We find an EDE model probability of $\\sim$90% whenever we include the H0 measurement from Type Ia Supernovae in the analysis, whereas the other data show a strong preference for the standard cosmological model.

Although they are expected to be numerous sources in the sky, their detection has evaded the most advanced transient surveys. This article characterizes the optical transient expected from DWD mergers in which the central remnant is a stable (sub-Chandrasekhar) WD. We show that the expansion and cooling of the merger's dynamical ejecta lead to an optical emission peaking at $1$-$10$ d post-merger, with luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We present simulations of the light-curves, spectra, and the color evolution of the transient. We show that these properties, together with the estimated rate of mergers, are consistent with the absence of detection, e.g., by The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).

Eccentric binaries radiate at widely-spaced frequency harmonics that must first be identified as originating from a single source and then analysed coherently. A multi-harmonic heterodyning approach for this type of data analysis is used to perform Bayesian parameter estimation on a range of simulated eccentric LISA signals. This is used to: (i) investigate LISA's ability to measure orbital eccentricity and to quantify the minimum detectable eccentricity; (ii) demonstrate how eccentricity and periastron precession help to break the mass degeneracy allowing the individual component masses to be inferred, potentially confirming the presence of a neutron star; (iii) investigate the possibility of source misidentification when the individual harmonics of an eccentric binary masquerade as separate circular binaries; and (iv) investigate the possibility of source reclassification, where parameter estimation results of multiple circular analyses are combined in postprocessing to quickly infer the parameters of an eccentric source.
