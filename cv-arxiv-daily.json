Helo et.al., [2510.14940v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14940v1)\n\n In Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) invisible neutron   decay arises from $d=12$ operators. Adding new, light particles to   the field content of the SM, such as right-handed neutrinos, allows   to construct operators for invisible neutron decay at much lower   dimensions. Observing invisible neutron decay, if nucleon decays   with charged leptons remain absent, would therefore point towards the   existence of new neutral degrees of freedom. Here, we discuss four   cases: (i) Adding right-handed neutrinos to the SM; (ii) a   right-handed neutrino and an axion-like particle; (iii) a   right-handed neutrino and a (nearly) massless singlet scalar; and   (iv) a right-handed neutrino and a light $Z'$. We give the general   tree-level decomposition for the resulting $d=(7-9)$ operators for   invisible neutron decay. We also briefly discuss LHC searches   related to the exotic states found in these UV completions.\n\n", "2510.14850": "2025-10-16, **General-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers: The influence of spin on the multi-messenger picture**, Anna Neuweiler et.al., [2510.14850v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14850v1)\n\n The rich phenomenology of binary neutron star mergers offers a unique opportunity to test general relativity, investigate matter at supranuclear densities, and learn more about the origin of heavy elements. As multi-messenger sources, they emit both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across several frequency bands. The interpretation of these signals relies heavily on accurate numerical-relativity simulations that incorporate the relevant microphysical processes. Using the latest updates of the BAM code, we perform general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with two different spin configurations. We adopt a state-of-the-art equation of state based on relativistic mean-field theory developed for dense matter in neutron star mergers. To capture both dynamical ejecta and secular outflows from magnetic and neutrino-driven winds, we evolve the systems up to $\\sim 100\\ \\rm ms$ after the merger at considerably high resolution with a grid spacing of $\\Delta x \\approx 93\\ \\rm m$ across the neutron stars. Our results show that the non-spinning configuration undergoes a more violent merger, producing more ejecta with lower electron fraction and higher velocities, while the spinning configuration forms a larger disk due to its higher angular momentum. Although the initial magnetic field amplification within $\\lesssim 10\\ \\rm ms$ after merger is similar in both systems, the non-spinning system reaches stronger magnetic fields and higher energies at later times. For a detailed view of the multi-messenger observables, we extract the gravitational-wave signal and compute nucleosynthesis yields, the expected kilonova and afterglow light curves from our ejecta profiles.\n\n", "2510.14636": "2025-10-16, **Performance of the Prototype Station of the IceCube Surface Array Enhancement**, S.

A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$ and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage.

Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for unparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to the precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of the entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly lensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos: \\emph{{i)}} through higher order caustics generating high relative magnification ($\\mu\\_r > 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the caustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for $\\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models, and \\emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images, which occur for $\\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find that these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in our simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of low-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in lensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction integral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We also report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the distributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo populations with increased number densities or concentrations. With the upcoming detection of strongly lensed events by ground- and space- based detectors, comparisons against these simulated distributions will provide insight into the nature of dark matter.\n\n", "2510.14877": "2025-10-16, **Astrophysical uncertainties challenge 21-cm forecasts: A primordial black hole case study**, Dominic Agius et.al., [2510.14877v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14877v1)\n\n The 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe's thermal history and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\\sim 1~M\\_\\odot-10^3~M\\_\\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.\n\n", "2510.14833": "2025-10-16, **Non-exotic traversable wormholes with strong deflection angle in King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter halos under f(R,Lm) gravity**, Susmita Sarkar et.al., [2510.14833v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14833v1)\n\n In this article, we investigate asymptotically flat non-exotic traversable wormhole geometries within the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter halos in the framework of $f(R, L\\_m)$ gravity.

The energy conditions are examined to verify the feasibility of sustaining the wormhole geometries with non-exotic matter, while embedding surfaces, proper radial distance, and total gravitational energy are studied to illustrate the wormhole's physical viability and traversability. Moreover, we test the strong deflection angle and its implications for gravitational lensing and show possible observational signatures of such wormhole configurations. Our results indicate that within $f(R, L\\_m)$ gravity, and for appropriate parameter choices, dark matter environments can sustain physically consistent non-exotic traversable wormhole geometries with distinct gravitational lensing signatures, providing new insights into the interplay between modified gravity, dark matter, and astrophysical observations.\n\n", "2510.14779": "2025-10-16, **The dark side of early galaxies: $\\texttt{geko}$ uncovers dark-matter fractions at $z\\sim4-6$**, A.

However, comparing observationally inferred SHMFs to theoretical predictions remains challenging, as the predicted SHMF can vary significantly between galaxies - even within the same cosmological model - due to differences in the properties and environment of individual galaxies. We present a machine learning framework to infer the galaxy-specific predicted SHMF from galaxy images, conditioned on the assumed inverse warm DM particle mass $M^{-1}\\_{\\rm DM}$. To train the model, we use 1024 high-resolution hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations from the DREAMS suite. Mock observations are generated using Synthesizer, excluding gas particle contributions, and SHMFs are computed with the Rockstar halo finder. Our neural network takes as input both the galaxy images and the inverse DM mass.

We find that these gamma-ray outflows are present in all three Milky-Way mass simulated galaxies. The amplitude, shape, and the composition of the gamma-ray spectrum of these bubbles fluctuates over time, with lepton-dominated and hadron-dominated phases. Spectra in which there is O(1) more gamma-ray flux from inverse Compton scattering than neutral pion decay are a good fit to the measured Fermi-LAT spectrum.

Based on our simulations, we propose a 1D analytical CSM model to be directly used for SN observable modeling. We predict that progenitor pulsations (seen in SN 2023ixf) and highly-confined CSM (seen in SN 2013fs) should be common among most hydrogen-rich SNe.
