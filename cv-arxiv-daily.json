II.~Signatures of Non-Thermal Dissipation in the Multi-Messenger Signals**, Annika Rudolph et.al., [2410.23258v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23258v1)\n\n Building on a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) jet with initial magnetization $\\sigma\\_0=150$, propagating through the dynamical ejecta from a binary neutron star merger, we identify regions of energy dissipation driven by magnetic reconnection and collisionless sub-shocks within different scenarios. We solve the transport equations for photons, electrons, protons, neutrinos, and intermediate particles up to the photosphere, accounting for all relevant radiative processes, including electron and proton acceleration, and investigate the potential impact of magnetic reconnection occurring in different regions along the jet. We find the photon spectra undergo non-thermal modifications below the photosphere, observable in both on-axis and off-axis emission directions, as well as across different scenarios of energy dissipation and subsequent particle acceleration. Interestingly, the spectral index of the photon energy distribution can at most vary by $\\sim20\\%$ across all different dissipation scenarios. Depending on the dissipation mechanism at play, neutrino signatures may accompany the photon signal, pointing to efficient proton acceleration and shedding light on jet physics. Although our findings are based on one jet simulation, they point to a potential universal origin of the non-thermal features of the Band spectrum observed in sGRBs.\n\n", "2410.23257": "2024-10-30, **Right-handed interactions in puzzling $B$-decays**, Damir Be\u010direvi\u0107 et.al., [2410.23257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23257v1)\n\n We explain the difference between the measured decay widths of $b \\to c \\tau \\nu$ processes and of $B\\to K\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ and their values predicted in the Standard Model by introducing the right-handed interactions both to quarks and to leptons.

Observations at frequencies between 30 and 80 MHz seem particularly promising -- if high-gain antennas focused at the horizon and blocking out as much as possible of the noisy sky are employed. Due to the large wavelengths, however, designing an antenna with the required properties is highly non-trivial at such low frequencies. In this article, we explore suitable antenna designs that provide the desired high gain, possess a smooth beam, are insensitive to ground conditions, are easily impedance-matched over the wide band, and are mechanically simple for deployment in large numbers in inaccessible terrain.

Once the proton has lost significant energy due to radiative and hadronic losses, and its gyroradius has decreased below typical scales on which the electromagnetic field varies, we apply a guiding center approximation (GCA). We fundamentally simulate collision processes either with a Monte-Carlo method or, where applicable, as a continuous energy loss, contingent on the local optical depth. To test our algorithm for the first time combining the effects of electromagnetic, gravitational, and radiation fields including hadronic interactions, we simulate highly relativistic protons traveling through various electromagnetic fields and proton backgrounds. We provide unit tests in various spatially dependent electromagnetic and gravitational fields and background photon and proton distributions, comparing the trajectory against analytic results.

For simple hypothesis tests, it is possible to define robust test statistics that will behave conservatively in the presence on unknown correlations. For model parameter fits, one can inflate the variance by factor to ensure that things remain conservative at least up to a chosen confidence level.

However, the neutrino emissivity due to Cooper-pair breaking and formation is too small to yield the observed cooling rate. Here, we show that such a rapid cooling can be explained once the non-Fermi liquid behavior of the non-superfluid neutron liquid induced by superfluid quantum criticality is included into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling, without assuming the existence of additional energy loss processes. Our results indicate that the neutron star in Cassiopeia A remains in the thermal relaxation stage, which is greatly prolonged by the non-Fermi liquid behavior.

An analysis with RSD data indicates smaller amplitude of perturbation. Including RSD data results in a slightly weaker upper limit on the neutrino mass than that derived for data without RSD, which is common in other extended models too. We have evaluated the impacts of RSD observations on some extended models, including the varying electron mass model, a time-dependent dark energy model with two parameter equations of state (EOS), and a model where the number of neutrino species is free. When we estimate the cosmological parameters for data including RSD, we found that the EOS parameter for dark energy is larger than that of the cosmological constant, and the effective number of neutrino species is smaller than the standard value, which infers a smaller present Hubble parameter $H\\_0$. From the viewpoint of cosmological tensions, the varying electron mass model with non-zero neutrino mass option looks promising to relax the Hubble tension and the $S\\_8$ tension simultaneously.\n\n", "2410.21881": "2024-10-29, **Neutrino detection rates from lepto-hadronic model simulations of bright blazar flares**, Joshua Robinson et.al., [2410.21881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21881v1)\n\n There is mounting evidence that blazars are the sources of part of the very-high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux detected by IceCube.

Using two types of silicon photomultipliers sensitive to different wavelength ranges, we identify a long-lived extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiative component that enhances the light yield. This component is present in both pure and xenon-doped LAr, becoming more pronounced at higher xenon concentrations, where it complements the traditional collisional energy transfer process. To explain this mechanism, we develop a comprehensive model of the Xe-doped LAr scintillation process that integrates both collisional and radiative contributions. Additionally, we investigate how xenon doping affects LAr scintillation light yield and pulse shape discrimination. Finally, we hypothesize that the EUV component may explain the emission of spurious electrons, a known challenge in light dark matter searches using noble liquids.

To detect the small quantum of energy carried in a photon, conventional SPDs rely on energy excitation across either a semiconductor bandgap or superconducting gap. While the energy gap suppresses the false-positive error, it also sets an energy scale that can limit the detection efficiency of lower energy photons and spectral bandwidth of the SPD.

By exploiting the extremely low heat capacity of the pseudo-relativistic electrons in graphene near its charge neutrality point, we observe an electron temperature rise up to ~2 K using a hybrid Josephson junction. In this proof-of-principle experiment, we achieve an intrinsic quantum efficiency of 87% (75%) with dark count < 1 per second (per hour) at operation temperatures as high as 1.2 K.

In relaxation solutions, a moduli dynamically adjusts the mass of dark matter and baryons until their energy densities are $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ the same. Because the QCD axion is heavily connected to QCD, scanning the QCD axion mass inherently also scans the proton mass. In the context of relaxation solutions, this implies that the ratio of dark matter to baryon abundances ($\\Omega\\_{\\rm DM}/\\Omega\\_{\\rm B}$) is a ratio of beta functions showing that these models can only accommodate discrete values of $\\Omega\\_{\\rm DM}/\\Omega\\_{\\rm B}$ thereby ``predicting\" the ratio of the dark matter to baryon abundances.

This is achieved by performing a series of basis transformation operations, allowing the coherent signal to be expressed as a combination of sensor population measurements without introducing background noise. We present a comprehensive analytical analysis and complement it with practical numerical simulations. These demonstrations reveal that signal strength is enhanced by the square of the number of sensors, while noise, primarily due to operational infidelity rather than background fluctuations, increases only linearly with the number of sensors.

We construct a sample of 278 paired galaxies spanning a stellar mass ($M\\_\\ast$) range from $10^{7.6}$ to $10^{11.2}M\\_\\odot$. We obtain individual masses of atomic hydrogen (HI) for these paired galaxies, using a novel deblending algorithm for HI data cubes. Quantifying the interaction stages and strengths with parameters motivated by first principles, we find that at fixed stellar and HI mass, the alteration in SFR of galaxy pairs starts when their dark matter halos encounter. For galaxies with stellar mass lower than $10^9M\\_\\odot$, their SFRs show tentative suppression of 1.4 sigma after the halo encounter, and then become enhanced when their HI disks overlap, regardless of mass ratios. In contrast, the SFRs of galaxies with $M\\_\\ast > 10^9M\\_\\odot$ increase monotonically toward smaller projected distances and radial velocity offsets. When a close companion is present, a pronounced SFR enhancement is found for the most HI-poor high-mass galaxies in our sample.

This study elucidates the dynamical evolution of subhaloes associated with the Milky Way-like host haloes. Unlike more massive dark matter haloes, which have been extensively studied, these subhaloes follow a distinct mass evolution pattern: an initial accretion phase, followed by a tidal stripping phase where mass is lost due to the tidal forces of the host halo. The transition from accretion to stripping, where subhaloes reach their maximum mass, occurs around a redshift of $z\\simeq1$. Smaller subhaloes reach this point earlier, while larger ones do so later. Our analysis reveals that over 80 per cent of subhaloes have experienced mass loss, underscoring the universality of tidal stripping in subhalo evolution. Additionally, we derived the eccentricities and pericentre distances of subhalo orbits from the simulations and compare them with those of nearby satellite galaxies observed by the Gaia satellite.

Due to its tiny coupling with photon, axion dark matter in the background can induce distinct phase velocities of light with different parity, an effect known as axion-induced birefringence. Here, we propose a modification to the polarization state of the inter-spacecraft laser link in LISA-like interferometers in space to make them sensitive to this birefringence effect. We discuss the prospects of using Sagnac combinations to search for axion dark matter and derive the corresponding sensitivity. With this setup, we show that next-generation laser interferometers in space would have great sensitivities on the axion-photon coupling with axion mass around $10^{-19}~\\text{eV}\\sim 10^{-14}~\\text{eV}$.\n\n", "2410.21874": "2024-10-29, **Invisible Higgs decay from dark matter freeze-in at stronger coupling**, Oleg Lebedev et.al., [2410.21874v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21874v2)\n\n We study the Higgs boson decay into dark matter (DM) in the framework of freeze-in at stronger coupling. Even though the Higgs-DM coupling is significant, up to order one, DM does not thermalize due to the Boltzmann suppression of its production at low temperatures. We find that this mechanism leads to observable Higgs decay into invisible final states with the branching fraction of 10% and below, while producing the correct DM relic abundance. This applies to the DM masses down to the MeV scale, which requires a careful treatment of the hadronic production modes. For DM masses below the muon threshold, the Boltzmann suppression is not operative and the freeze-in nature of the production mechanism is instead guaranteed by the smallness of the electron Yukawa coupling. As a result, MeV DM with a significant coupling to the Higgs boson remains non-thermal as long as the reheating temperature does not exceed $\\mathcal{O}(100)\\;$MeV. Our findings indicate that there are good prospects for observing light non-thermal DM via invisible Higgs decay at the LHC and FCC.\n\n", "2410.21777": "2024-10-29, **Scalar dark matter multiplet of global $O(N)$ symmetry**, U-Rae Kim et.al., [2410.21777v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21777v1)\n\n We study two types of models involving a scalar dark matter multiplet of global $O(N)$ symmetry.

We derive the allowed regions for the dark matter mass and new scalar couplings based on constraints from Higgs invisible decay, the relic abundance of dark matter, and the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section. Within the allowed parameter space, we also discuss the vacuum stability of the Higgs potential and the perturbativity of the scalar couplings in both models.

Cristofari et.al., [2410.23190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23190v1)\n\n Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is a prominent mechanism for energizing charged particles up to very large rigidities at astrophysical collisionless shocks. In addition to ions and electrons, it has been proposed that interstellar dust grains could also be accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration, for instance, at supernova remnants (SNRs). Considering interstellar dust grains of various size and composition, we investigate the possibility of grain acceleration at young SNR shocks (throughout the free expansion and Sedov-Taylor phases) and the maximum energies reached by the accelerated grains. We investigate the potential implications on the abundance of refractory species relative to volatile elements in the cosmic-ray composition. We rely on semi-analytical descriptions of particle acceleration at strong shocks, and on self-similar solutions for the dynamics of SNR shock waves. For simplicity, type Ia thermonuclear SNRs expanding in uniform interstellar medium are considered. We find that the acceleration of dust grains at relativistic speed is possible, up to Lorentz factor of $\\sim 10^{2}$, kinetic energy $E\\_{\\rm k}/\\text{nuc}\\sim 10^2$ GeV/nuc for the smaller grains of size $a\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-7}$ cm.

By comparing Solar-scaled models to ones enriched in $\\alpha$-process elements, we find that stellar radii, surface temperatures, Main Sequence lifetimes, supernova progenitor properties and supernova rates are all sensitive to changes in [$\\alpha$/Fe]. Lifetimes of low-mass stars differ by up to 0.4 dex, while surface temperatures of massive stars at the end of the Main Sequence also differ by around 0.4 dex. Inferred supernova rates when [Fe/H] is unknown can be highly uncertain. Models with different [$\\alpha$/Fe] but comparable iron abundances show smaller variations, indicating that while iron primarily defines the course of evolution; $\\alpha$-enhancement nonetheless has an impact of up to 0.1 dex on stellar properties. Such changes are small for individual stars, but have a large cumulative effect when considering an entire stellar population as demonstrated by isochrone fitting to nearby clusters.

For spherical problems, such as ideal supernova explosions or stellar wind-blown bubble expansions, simulating only along a radial dimension drastically reduces compute and memory demands compared to a full three-dimensional method. This simplification also alleviates constraints on backpropagation through the solver. Written in JAX, jf1uids is a GPU-compatible and fully differentiable simulator.

The pure rotational transitions 0-0 S(1) and S(5) of H2, and the ground-state 110-101 transition of H2O, are all broadened, arising from molecules that survive the passage of the shock front. Theoretical models from the Paris-Durham shock code were analyzed to generate synthetic profiles that approximately match the observations. The observations can be fit with two shock conditions, which approximate the range of densities in the pre-shock molecular cloud. The width and brightness of the S(5) lines require shocks into gas with a density of order 2,000 cm-3, into which the IC 443 blast wave drives shocks with speed 60 km/s. The brightness and narrower width of the S(1) lines requires different shocks, into gas with density of order 10^5 cm-3, with shock speeds of 10 km/s. The H2O velocity distribution is also consistent with these shocks. The existence of shocks into dense gas shows that the bright shocked clumps in IC~443 were prestellar cores. It is unlikely that they will form stars soon after the passage of the shock front, given the input of kinetic and thermal energy from the shocks.\n\n", "2410.22416": "2024-10-29, **ERGO-ML: A continuous organization of the X-ray galaxy cluster population in TNG-Cluster with contrastive learning**, Urmila Chadayammuri et.al., [2410.22416v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22416v1)\n\n The physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) reflect signatures of the underlying gravitational potential, mergers and strong interactions with other halos and satellite galaxies, as well as galactic feedback from supernovae and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Traditionally, clusters have been characterized in terms of summary statistics, such as halo mass, X-ray luminosity, cool-core state, luminosity of AGN, and number of merging components. In this paper of the Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning series (ERGO-ML), we instead consider the full information content available in maps of X-ray emission from the ICM. We employ Nearest Neighbour Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) to identify and populate a low-dimensional representation space of such images. Using idealized X-ray maps of the 352 clusters of the TNG-Cluster cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation suite, we take three orthogonal projections of each cluster at eight snapshots within the redshift range $0\\leq z<1$, resulting in a dataset of $\\sim$8,000 images. Our findings reveal that this representation space forms a continuous distribution from relaxed to merging objects, and from centrally-peaked to flat emission profiles. The representation also exhibits clear trends with redshift, with halo, gas, stellar, and SMBH mass, with time since a last major merger, and with indicators of dynamical state. We show that an 8-dimensional representation can be used to predict a variety of cluster properties, find analogs, and identify correlations between physical properties, thereby suggesting causal relationships. Our analysis demonstrates that contrastive learning is a powerful tool for characterizing galaxy clusters from their images alone, allowing us to derive constraints on their physical properties and formation histories using cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy simulations.\n\n", "2410.22401": "2024-10-29, **Fast Transients from Magnetic Disks Around Non-Spinning Collapsar Black Holes**, Justin Bopp et.al., [2410.22401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22401v1)\n\n Most black holes (BHs) formed in collapsing stars have low spin, though some are expected to acquire a magnetic accretion disk during the collapse. While such BH disks can launch magnetically driven winds, their physics and observational signatures have remained unexplored. We present global 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars that form slowly spinning BHs with accretion disks. As the disk transitions to a magnetically arrested state, it drives mildly relativistic, wobbling, collimated magnetic outflows through two mechanisms: steady outflows along vertical magnetic field lines (''Blandford-Payne jets'') and magnetic flux eruptions. With an isotropic-equivalent energy of $E\\_{\\rm iso}\\approx10^{52}\\,{\\rm erg}$, exceeding that of relativistic jets from BHs with spin $a\\lesssim 0.25$, the disk outflows unbind the star, ultimately capping the final BH mass at $ M\\_{\\rm BH} \\approx 4\\,M\\_\\odot$.

Our cooling emission estimates suggest a bright near-ultraviolet and optical signal at absolute magnitude $M\\_{\\rm AB}\\approx-16$ lasting for several days. This indicates that disk winds could be responsible for the first peak in the double-peaked light curves observed in Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe) or power another class of transients.

Potential threats to habitability from the local stellar environment mainly arise from two factors: cataclysmic events such as powerful stellar explosions and orbital perturbations induced by close stellar encounters. Among the 4,500+ exoplanet-hosting stars, about 140+ are known to host planets in their habitable zones. In this study, we use \\textit{Gaia DR3} data to investigate the 10~pc stellar neighborhood of the 84 habitable zone systems (HZS) closest to the Sun. We assess the possible risks that local stellar environment of these HZS pose to their habitability. In particular, we find that HD~165155 has a high stellar density around it, making it likely to experience at least one flyby encounter within a span of 5~Gyr. We also identified two high-mass stars ($M \\geq 8 M\\_\\odot$) as potential progenitors of supernovae, which could threaten the long-term survivability of habitable zone systems HD~48265 and TOI-1227.

Boos et.al., [2410.22276v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22276v1)\n\n Many promising explosion models for the elusive origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ultimately fail to completely reproduce a number of observed properties of these events. One limiting factor for many of these models is the use of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption in the calculation of their synthetic observables, which has been shown to prevent the accurate prediction of a number of fundamental features of SNe Ia. The inclusion of high-accuracy non-LTE physics, however, increases computational cost and complexity such that multidimensional non-LTE calculations are often unfeasible, which can be problematic for models that are inherently multidimensional. In this work, we conduct radiative transfer calculations using 1D profiles that each correspond with a line of sight from an asymmetric, 2D SN Ia model. We find, in LTE, that the synthetic observables from these calculations efficiently reproduce those from the 2D calculation when an equivalence of bolometric luminosities between the 1D and 2D treatments is enforced. This allows for the accurate calculation of synthetic observables in 1D while still preserving multidimensional effects associated with the model. We leverage this to produce high accuracy observables from 1D non-LTE calculations, showing significantly improved agreement with observation, including a roughly 50% reduction of $B$-band decline rate into congruence with the observed Phillips relation. Additionally, our non-LTE observables show Si II $\\lambda$5972 pEWs that are much more similar to observation, while spanning multiple Branch classes, suggesting that some spectral classifications of SNe Ia arise from line of sight effects.\n\n", "2410.22138": "2024-10-29, **On the Ubiquity of Extreme Baryon Concentrations in the Early Universe**, Alvio Renzini et.al., [2410.22138v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22138v2)\n\n Early JWST observations have revealed the ubiquitous presence in the early Universe, up to z about 16, of extreme baryon concentrations, namely forming globular clusters, extremely dense galaxies that may or may not be UV bright, and supermassive black holes in relatively low-mass galaxies. This paper is trying to pinpoint which physical conditions may have favored the formation of such concentrations, that appear to be very common at high redshifts while their formation being progressively more and more rare at lower redshifts. Building on local globular cluster evidence, it is argued that such conditions can consist in a combination of a 10 Myr extended feedback free time, coupled to low angular-momentum densities in deep local minima of the ISM vorticity field, where baryon concentrations are more likely to form. It is argued that the former condition would follow from more massive stars failing to explode as supernovae, and the latter one from low vorticity prevailing in the early Universe, in contrast to later times with their secular increase of the angular momentum density due to the cumulative effect of tidal interactions.\n\n", "2410.22073": "2024-10-29, **SN 1885A and supernova remnants in the centre of M31 with LOFAR**, Deepika Venkattu et.al., [2410.22073v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22073v1)\n\n We present the first LOFAR image of the centre of M31 at a frequency of 150 MHz. We clearly detect three supernova remnants, which, along with archival VLA data at 3 GHz and other published radio and X-ray data allows us to characterize them in detail. Our observations also allow us to obtain upper limits the historical SN 1885A which is undetected even at a low frequency of 150 MHz.

From the $2.6\\sigma$ tentative detection in X-ray, our analysis shows that non-thermal emission is expected to dominate the SN 1885A emission.

For weak lensing analyses in particular, a key challenge arises from the incomplete understanding of how non-gravitational processes, such as supernovae and active galactic nuclei - collectively known as baryonic feedback - affect the matter distribution. Several existing methods for modeling baryonic feedback treat it independently from the underlying cosmology, an assumption which has been found to be inaccurate by hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we examine the impact of this coupling between baryonic feedback and cosmology on parameter inference at LSST Y1 precision. We build mock 3$\\times$2pt data vectors using the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which span a wide range of cosmologies while keeping subgrid parameters fixed. We perform simulated likelihood analyses for two baryon mitigation techniques: (i) the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method which identifies eigenmodes for capturing the effect baryonic feedback on the data vector and (ii) HMCode2020 (Mead et al. 2021) which analytically models the modification in the matter distribution using a halo model approach.
