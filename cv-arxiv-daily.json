This paper details the equalization of the response to charge in the ICARUS time projection chamber (TPC), as well as data-driven tuning of the simulation of ionization charge signals and electronics noise. The equalization procedure removes non-uniformities in the ICARUS TPC response to charge in space and time. This work leverages the copious number of cosmic ray muons available to ICARUS at the surface. The ionization signal shape simulation applies a novel procedure that tunes the simulation to match what is measured in data. The end result of the equalization procedure and simulation tuning allows for a comparison of charge measurements in ICARUS between Monte Carlo simulation and data, showing good performance with minimal residual bias between the two.\n\n", "2407.11912": "2024-07-16, **The CONUS+ experiment**, The CONUS+ Collaboration et.al., [2407.11912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11912v1)\n\n The CONUS+ experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) of reactor antineutrinos on germanium nuclei in the fully coherent regime, continuing on this way the CONUS physics program started at the Brokdorf nuclear power plant, Germany. The CONUS+ setup is installed in the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland, at a distance of 20.7 m from the 3.6 GW thermal power reactor core. The CEvNS signature will be measured with the same four point-contact high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors produced for the former experiment, however refurbished and with optimized low energy thresholds. To suppress the background in the CONUS+ detectors, the passive and active layers of the original CONUS shield were modified such to fit better to the significantly changed background conditions at the new experimental location. New data acquisition and monitoring systems were developed. A direct network connection between the experiment and the Max-Planck-Institut fur Kernphysik (MPIK) makes it possible to control and monitor data acquisition in real time. The impact of all these modifications is discussed with particular emphasis on the resulting CEvNS signal prediction for the first data collection phase of CONUS+.

This dependency is particularly relevant when the neutrino mass matrix has a generic structure, introducing uncertainty in the prediction of nucleon decay branching fractions within flipped SU(5). In this paper, we demonstrate that this uncertainty can be parametrized using two parameters, which can be determined by measuring the partial lifetimes of $p \\to \\pi^0 e^+$, $p \\to \\pi^0 \\mu^+$, and $n \\to \\pi^0 \\bar{\\nu}$.

While knot-like excitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the fundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary particles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the appearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear as meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of particle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This result suggests that during the early Universe, a \"knot dominated era\" may have existed, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this scenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we propose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum tunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle physics and represent a modern version of Kelvin's hypothesis.\n\n", "2407.11410": "2024-07-16, **High-energy neutrino emission from tidal disruption event outflow-cloud interactions**, Hanji Wu et.al., [2407.11410v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11410v1)\n\n Tidal disruption events (TDEs), characterized by their luminous transients and high-velocity outflows, have emerged as plausible sources of high-energy neutrinos contributing to the diffuse neutrino. In this study, we calculate the contribution of TDEs to the diffuse neutrino by employing the outflow-cloud model within the TDE framework.

Given the different neutrino energy spectra and nuclear targets employed by the three experiments, comparisons of model predictions to their measurements breaks degeneracies that would be present in any single measurement. In particular, the comparison of T2K and MINERvA measurements offers a probe of energy dependence, whilst a comparison of T2K and MicroBooNE investigates scaling with nuclear target. In order to isolate the impact of individual nuclear effects, model comparisons are made following systematic alterations to: the nuclear ground state; final state interactions and multi-nucleon interaction strength. The measurements are further compared to the generators used as an input to DUNE/SBN and T2K/Hyper-K analyses. Whilst no model is able to quantitatively describe all the measurements, evidence is found for mis-modelling of A-scaling in multi-nucleon interactions and it is found that tight control over how energy is distributed among hadrons following final state interactions is likely to be crucial to achieving improved agreement.

On one hand, there has been a significant increase in the observation of transient phenomena, which are short-lived events such as supernova explosions, fast radio bursts, and gamma-ray bursts. In addition, the detection of a growing number of different cosmic messengers provides researchers with crucial information about these objects.

This trend is expected to intensify in the coming years with the commissioning of a wide variety of next-generation observatories, which will enable more in-depth studies of the transient sky.

An example of application for this kind of detectors are Compton polarimeters such as POLAR-2 or LEAP, for which a low-Z material is needed for the Compton effect to be dominant down to as low energy as possible. Such detectors aim to measure low energy Compton depositions which produce small amounts of optical light, and for which optimizing the instrumental optical properties consequently imperative.   The light collection efficiency of such a device was studied with a focus on the POLAR-2 GRB polarimeter, in which the conversion of incoming $\\gamma$-rays into readable signal goes through the production and collection of optical light, which was to be optimized both through measurements and simulations. The optical elements of the POLAR-2 polarimeter prototype module were optically characterized and an optical simulation based on Geant4 was developed to fully model its optical performances. The results from simulations were used to optimize the design and finally to verify its performance. The study resulted in a detector capable of measuring energy depositions of several keV. In addition an important finding of this work is the impact of the plastic scintillator surface roughness on the light collection. It was found that a plastic scintillator with a higher scintillation efficiency but made of a softer material, hence with a rougher surface, was not necessarily the best option to optimize the light collection. Furthermore, in order to optimize the optical crosstalk between different channels, a production technique for very thin ($\\sim$150$~\\mu$m) and reusable silicone-based optical coupling pads, which can be applied for other experiments, was developed.\n\n", "2407.10717": "2024-07-15, **Search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons in proton-proton collision events with a lepton-jet pair associated with a secondary vertex at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV**, CMS Collaboration et.al., [2407.10717v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10717v1)\n\n A search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$ collected at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC is presented.

In the theoretical modeling of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), there has been a great deal of attention to recent discoveries of a new type of neutrino flavor conversions, namely collisional flavor instability (CFI), in which the instability is induced by the flavor-dependent decoherence due to the disparity of neutrino-matter interactions among flavors. In this paper, we study how the appearance of on-shell muons and associated neutrino-matter interactions can impact CFIs based on linear stability analysis of flavor conversions. Some striking results emerge from the present study. First, we analytically show that breaking beta- and pair equilibrium is a necessary condition to trigger CFIs. This also indicates that CFIs with on-shell muons could appear in $e \\tau$ and $\\mu \\tau$ neutrino mixing sectors in very high-density region ($\\gtrsim 10^{13} {\\rm g/cm^{3}}$), exhibiting a possibility of large impacts of CFIs on CCSN. Second, resonance-like CFIs, having a much higher growth rate than normal CFIs, can be triggered by muons.

The extreme precision and accuracy of forthcoming observations of CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, aiming to detect the tiny signatures of primordial gravitational waves or of light relic particles beyond the standard three light neutrinos, requires commensurate precision in the modelling of foreground Galactic emission that contaminates CMB observations.   Aims. We evaluate the impact of second-order effects in Galactic foreground emission due to Thomson scattering off interstellar free electrons and to Rayleigh scattering off interstellar dust particles.   Methods. We use existing sky survey data and models of the distribution of free electrons and dust within the Milky Way to estimate the amplitude and power spectra of the emission originating from radiation scattered either by free electrons or by dust grains at CMB frequencies.   Results. Both processes generate corrections to the total emission that are small compared to direct emission, and are small enough not to pose problems for current-generation observations.

However, B-modes generated by Thomson scattering of incoming radiation by interstellar free electrons at CMB frequencies are within an order of magnitude of the sensitivity of the most advanced forthcoming CMB telescopes, and might require more precise evaluation in the future.\n\n"}, "dark matter": {"2407.11737": "2024-07-16, **A $\\sim 43$ GeV $\u03b3$-ray line signature in the directions of a group of nearby massive galaxy clusters**, Yi-Zhong Fan et.al., [2407.11737v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11737v1)\n\n As the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe, galaxy clusters have provided the first piece of evidence for the presence of dark matter and may be suitable targets for indirect dark matter searches.

This solution aligns in form with previous studies on photon-gravitational wave conversion. Interestingly, it is applicable in situations where the WKB approximation fails. We extend the unitary evolution solution to other conversion processes, such as axion-photon and dark photon-photon conversions. When the WKB approximation conditions are met, this solution reduces to the WKB result. We compute the characteristic strain of gravitational waves resulting from dark photon conversion in the solar magnetic field, spanning frequencies from $10^{-5}$ Hz to $10^3$ Hz. Our findings indicate that the characteristic strain derived from the unitary evolution solution differs significantly from that of the WKB solution.

We focus on static, asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric black holes and naked singularities supported by a real self-gravitating scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. We consider the influence of dark matter on the tidal forces caused by the central objects and some features of the motion of matter near these configurations. It turns out, first, that the event horizon radius of a scalar field black hole can be arbitrarily small as well as the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, and tidal forces near this orbit can be very large. Second, we show that if strongly gravitating objects in the centers of galaxies are naked singularities, then bright flares (tidal disruption events) in the nuclei of galaxies can be explained in different way. In the vicinity of a scalar field naked singularity, baryonic matter is concentrated in the gravitational potential well forming a \"gray shell\" consisting of cold compressed matter.

We apply this method to a resonant atom interferometer and achieve thousand-fold phase amplification, representing a fifty-fold improvement over the performance observed without optimized control. Moreover, we find that spurious interference can arise from the interplay of spontaneous emission and many-pulse sequences and demonstrate optimization strategies to mitigate this effect.

They rotate nearly rigidly with an angular frequency called pattern speed. Previous idealised simulations have shown that bar pattern speed decreases with time due to dynamical friction exerted by the dark matter halo, while cold gas can reduce or even reverse this trend. We want to understand how different galaxy properties affect the evolution of the bar pattern speed in more realistic situations, including ongoing star formation, mass infall, AGN feedback and galaxy interactions. We used the high-resolution run TNG50-1 of the magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulations suite IllustrisTNG to trace the pattern speed of simulated bars and see how it depends on various galaxy properties. Simulated bars with initially high pattern speed and a subsequent rapid slowdown are more likely found in more massive galaxies. Lower mass galaxies, on the other hand, preferentially host bars that start at relatively low pattern speeds and retain the same value until the end of the simulation. More massive barred galaxies are also more affected by the AGN feedback, which removes (or heats up) the cold gas that could have prevented the slowdown. We find that bars grow and strengthen with slowdown, in agreement with higher resolution simulations. We find that strong correlations between the bar slowdown rate and galaxy mass weaken considerably when we use dimensionless measures to quantify the slowdown. In TNG50, the AGN feedback prescription amplifies the mass dependence.

B\u00edlek et.al., [2407.11139v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11139v1)\n\n Dynamical friction works very differently for Newtonian gravity with dark matter and in modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). While the absence of dark matter considerably reduces the friction in major galaxy mergers, analytic calculations indicate the opposite for very small perturbations, such as globular clusters (GCs) sinking in dwarf galaxies. Here, we study the decay of GCs in isolated gas-rich dwarf galaxies using simulations with the Phantom of Ramses code, which enables both the Newtonian and the QUMOND MOND gravity. We modeled the GCs as point masses, and we simulated the full hydrodynamics, with star formation and supernovae feedback. We explored whether the fluctuations in gravitational potential caused by the supernovae can prevent GCs from sinking toward the nucleus. For GCs of typical mass or lighter, we find that this indeed works in both Newtonian and MOND simulations. The GC can even make a random walk. However, we find that supernovae cannot prevent massive GCs ($M\\geq 4\\times10^5\\,M\\_\\odot$) from sinking in MOND. The resulting object looks similar to a galaxy with an offset core, which embeds the sunk GC. The problem is much milder in the Newtonian simulations. This result thus favors Newtonian over QUMOND gravity, but we note that it relies on the correctness of the difficult modeling of baryonic feedback. We propose that the fluctuations in the gravitational potential could be responsible for the thickness of the stellar disks of dwarf galaxies and that strong supernova winds in modified gravity can transform dwarf galaxies into ultra-diffuse galaxies.\n\n", "2407.11112": "2024-07-15, **A Nuclear Interferometer for Ultra-Light Dark Matter Detection**, Hannah Banks et.al., [2407.11112v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11112v1)\n\n We propose the nuclear interferometer - a single-photon interferometry experiment based upon the thorium-229 nuclear clock transition - as a novel detector for ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). Thanks to the enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the variation of fundamental constants, we find that possible realisations of such an experiment deploying either single ions or clouds of atoms have the potential to be complementary to advanced very-long-baseline terrestrial clock atom interferometers in the search for ultra-light dark matter with scalar couplings to photons.

An important exception to this inefficiency is regions of high gravitational accelerations $g$, or equivalently surface densities $\\Sigma = g/(\\pi\\,G)$, where stellar feedback is insufficient to overcome the self-gravity of dense gas clouds. In this paper, I explore whether dark matter can play an analogous role in providing the requisite accelerations on the scale of entire galaxies in the early cosmos. The key insight is that characteristic accelerations in dark matter halos scale as $(1+z)^2$ at fixed halo mass. I show this is sufficient to make dark matter the source of intense accelerations that might induce efficient star formation on galactic scales at cosmic dawn in sufficiently massive halos. The mass characterizing this regime scales as $(1+z)^{-6}$ and corresponds to a relatively constant comoving number density of $n(>\\!M\\_{\\rm vir}) \\approx 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \\gtrsim 8$.

The size of the simulation is dictated by the largest scales one aims to probe, while the resolution is determined by the smallest dark matter haloes capable of hosting the first stars. We present a hybrid approach where the density and tidal fields of a large-volume, low-resolution simulation are combined with small haloes from a small-volume, high-resolution box. By merging these two boxes of relatively lower dynamic range, we achieve an effective high-dynamic range simulation using only 13% of the computational resources required for a full high-dynamic range simulation. Our method accurately reproduces the one- and two-point statistics of the halo field, its cross-correlation with the dark matter density field, and the two-point statistics of the HI field computed using a semi-numerical code, all within 10% accuracy at large scales and across different redshifts.

For approximately 385 days following the explosion, SN 2021dbg exhibited remarkable luminosity, surpassing most SNe II. This initial high luminosity is potentially attributed to the interaction between the ejected material and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), as evidenced by the pronounced interaction signatures observed in its spectra. The subsequent high luminosity is primarily due to the significant $^{56}$Ni ($0.17 \\pm 0.05$ M$\\_{\\odot}$) produced in the explosion. Based on the flux of flash emission lines detected in the initial spectra, we estimate that the CSM mass near the progenitor amounted to $\\sim$(1.0--2.0) $\\times 10^{-3}$ M$\\_{\\odot}$, likely resulting from intense stellar wind activity 2--3 yr preceding the explosion.

It is formed by a head region, where the pulsar J2229+6114 and its boomerang-shaped pulsar wind nebula are located, and a tail region containing SN ejecta. The lack of observed gamma ray emission from the two regions of this SNR has made it difficult to assess which region would be responsible for the PeV CRs. We aim to characterize the very-high-energy (VHE, 0.1-100 TeV) gamma ray emission from SNR G106.3+2.7 by determining the morphology and spectral energy distribution of the region. This is accomplished using 2565 days of data and improved reconstruction algorithms from the HAWC Observatory. We also explore possible gamma ray production mechanisms for different energy ranges. Using a multi-source fitting procedure based on a maximum-likelihood estimation method, we evaluate the complex nature of this region. We determine the morphology, spectrum, and energy range for the source found in the region. Molecular cloud information is also used to create a template and evaluate the HAWC gamma ray spectral properties at ultra-high-energies (UHE, >56 TeV). This will help probe the hadronic nature of the highest-energy emission from the region. We resolve one extended source coincident with all other gamma ray observations of the region. The emission reaches above 100~TeV and its preferred log-parabola shape in the spectrum shows a flux peak in the TeV range.

The relative time delays between lensed SN images provide an independent way of measuring a fundamental cosmological parameter -- the Hubble constant -- , the value of which is currently under debate. The time delays also serve as a ``time machine'', offering a unique opportunity to capture the extremely early phase of the SN explosion, which can be used to constrain the SN progenitor and explosion mechanism. Although there are only a handful of strongly lensed SN discoveries so far, which greatly hinders scientific applications, the sample size is expected to grow substantially with next-generation surveys. In this work, we investigate the capability of detecting strongly lensed SNe with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), a two-meter space telescope to be launched around 2026. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that CSST can detect 1008.53 and 51.78 strongly lensed SNe from its Wide Field Survey (WFS, covering 17,500 deg$^2$) and Deep Field Survey (DFS, covering 400 deg$^2$) over the course of ten years.
