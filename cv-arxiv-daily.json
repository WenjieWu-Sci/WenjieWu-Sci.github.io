We use gamma rays, fast and thermal neutrons, and study the difference in responses they induce, showing that this type of detector is rather insensitive to gamma rays. We use light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to image nuclear recoil tracks from fast and thermal neutron interactions deep inside a cubic-centimeter sized crystal and demonstrate automated feature extraction in three dimensions using machine learning tools. The number, size, and topology of the events agree with expectations based on simulations with TRIM.

A subset of stations also includes underground muon detectors. Additionally, fluorescence detectors located at four sites overlook the array. The science goals for the enhanced Observatory include the measurement of the properties of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with large statistics and high sensitivity to the primary composition. The Observatory is also sensitive to photons and neutrinos at the highest energies, allowing it to participate in multi-messenger studies. The Auger Offline Framework provides the tools to perform detailed simulations, using the Geant 4 toolkit, of all components of the Observatory and the analysis of both data and simulated events. It proved to have the flexibility needed to evolve during the lifetime of the Observatory, to accommodate new sub-detectors and, recently, changes to the station readout electronics.

They may originate from the early universe, supernova, pulsar merger event, and so on. Depending on the equation of state, the SNs could be stable and even be one of the candidates for dark matter. In order to detect SNs which hitting the Earth or the Moon at a non-relativistic velocity, a new messenger, the acoustic array, is analysed. The results of the calculations show that the impact signal of an SN can be detected at a distance of about 30 kilometers from the nugget's trajectory. By using microphone boxes, hydrophones or seismographs to construct an array in the bedrock, ocean or on the Moon, it is possible to reconstruct the velocity, mass, and interacting cross section of SNs, and then constrain also the nature of supra-nuclear matter. The acoustic array can also be used for distributed acoustic sensing of meteorites or earthquakes.

However, due to their high sensitivity, PMTs are vulnerable to significant damage to their photocathode coating when exposed to intense light and/or high temperatures. Although this scenario is rare under controlled conditions, it can become relevant in experiments with prolonged exposure to sunlight and elevated temperatures.   This study presents an analysis of the damage threshold and recovery time of photomultipliers with bialkali metal coatings.

JUNO aims to determine the neutrino mass ordering and precisely measure the neutrino oscillation parameters by detecting reactor neutrinos from nuclear power plants. In addition to reactor neutrinos, JUNO can study atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, geo-neutrinos, supernova burst neutrinos, the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), and nucleon decay, covering an energy range from keV to TeV.

Precise simulation plays a crucial role in the experiment. Developed using the SNiPER framework and Geant4 toolkit, the JUNO simulation software is a key component of the JUNO offline software (JUNOSW). The large detector size and the broad energy range of interest pose challenges for detector simulation in terms of CPU time and memory consumption. As the computing nodes shift to include multiple integrated CPU cores, traditional single-threaded computing model can lead to large memory footprints and inefficient use of system resources.

A concurrent solution arises when one of the right-handed neutrinos, necessary for the generation of light neutrino masses, is itself the dark matter candidate. In this article, we study the generation of such a dark matter candidate relying solely on the presence of neutrino mixing. This tightly links the generation of dark matter with searches in laboratory experiments on top of the usual indirect dark matter probes. We find that the regions of parameter space producing the observed dark matter abundance can be probed indirectly with electroweak precision observables and charged lepton flavor violation searches. Given that the heavy neutrino masses need to lie at most around the TeV scale, probes at future colliders would further test this production mechanism.\n\n", "2503.19973": "2025-03-25, **Multi-messenger Gravitational Lensing**, Graham P.

On the other hand, the neutrino mass matrix is generated via a seesaw with four-by-four block mass matrix where the right-handed neutral fermions are also added.

One possible source of ultra-high-energy particles is the rapid, violent emission of energetic Hawking radiation from a primordial black hole (PBH) near the end of its evaporation lifetime.

Concretely, for Schwarzschild PBHs, i.e., uncharged and non-rotating black holes, this rules out black hole masses of less than $10^{-15} M\\_{\\odot}$. In this article, we propose that by including an additional 'dark' $U(1)$ charge one can significantly lower the PBHs' Hawking temperature, slowing down their evaporation process and significantly extending their lifetimes. With this, PBHs again become a viable option for dark matter candidates over a large mass range. We will explore in detail the effects of varying the dark electron (lightest dark charged fermion) mass and charge on the evaporation dynamics. For instance, we will show that by allowing the dark electron to have a sufficiently high mass and/or low charge, our approach suppresses both Hawking radiation and the Schwinger effect, effectively extending even the lifespan of PBHs with masses smaller than $10^{-15} M\\_{\\odot}$ beyond the current age of the universe. We will finally present a new lower bound on the allowed mass range for dark-charged PBHs as a function of the dark electron charge and mass, showing that the PBHs' mass can get to at least as low as $10^{-24}M\\_\\odot$ depending on the dark electron properties.

Our simple and most conservative analysis suggests that the gas is more extended than the dark matter (99.5% confidence, i.e. PTE = 0.005).

M. Lau et.al., [2503.20506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20506v1)\n\n We present 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of common-envelope (CE) evolution involving a 12 solar mass red supergiant donor and a 3 solar mass companion. Existing 3D simulations are predominantly adiabatic, focusing strongly on low-mass donors on the red giant and asymptotic giant branches. However, the adiabatic assumption breaks down once the perturbed CE material becomes optically thin or when entering a longer-timescale evolutionary phase after the dynamical plunge-in. This is especially important for high-mass red supergiant donors, which have short thermal timescales, adding significant uncertainty in understanding how massive binary stars evolve into gravitational-wave sources, X-ray binaries, stripped-envelope supernovae, and more. We compare our radiation hydrodynamics simulations with an adiabatic simulation from Paper I that is otherwise identical, finding that radiative diffusion strongly inhibits CE ejection. The fraction of ejected mass is roughly half that of the adiabatic case when recombination energy release is not included. Almost no material is ejected during the dynamical plunge-in, and longer-timescale ejection during the slow spiral-in is suppressed. However, the orbital separation reached at the end of the dynamical plunge-in does not differ significantly. The large amount of remaining bound mass tentatively supports the emerging view that the dynamical plunge-in is followed by a non-adiabatic phase, during which a substantial fraction of the envelope is ejected and the binary orbit may continue to evolve.\n\n", "2503.20002": "2025-03-25, **Predictions for new physics in the CMB damping tail**, Tristan L.

There are a handful of proposed mechanisms operating in the early universe which have shown some promise in resolving the Hubble tension. These mechanisms are expected to leave a measurable impact on the smallest scale CMB anisotropy, deep in the damping tail. Using current CMB data, baryonic acoustic oscillation data, and the luminosities of type Ia supernovae as a baseline, we compute the predicted small-scale CMB power spectra for a characteristic set of these models. We find that near-future CMB data should be able to detect some but not all of the investigated models.\n\n", "2503.19969": "2025-03-25, **Inferring CSM Properties of Type II SNe Using a Magnitude-Limited ZTF Sample**, K-Ryan Hinds et.al., [2503.19969v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19969v1)\n\n Although all Type II supernovae (SNe) originate from massive stars possessing a hydrogen-rich envelope, their light curve morphology is diverse, reflecting poorly characterised heterogeneity in the physical properties of their progenitor systems. Here, we present a detailed light curve analysis of a magnitude-limited sample of 639 Type II SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. Using Gaussian processes, we systematically measure empirical light curve features (e.g. rise times, peak colours and luminosities) in a robust sampling-independent manner. We focus on rise times as they are highly sensitive to pre-explosion progenitor properties, especially the presence of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) shed by the progenitor in the years immediately pre-explosion. By correlating our feature measurements with physical parameters from an extensive grid of STELLA hydrodynamical models with varying progenitor properties (CSM structure, $\\dot M$, $R\\_{CSM}$ and $M\\_{ZAMS}$), we quantify the proportion of events with sufficient pre-explosion mass-loss to significantly alter the initial light curve (roughly $M\\_{CSM} \\geq 10^{-2.5} M\\_{\\odot}$) in a highly complete sample of 377 spectroscopically classified Type II SNe. We find that 67 $\\pm$ 6\\% of observed SNe in our magnitude-limited sample show evidence for substantial CSM ($M\\_{CSM} \\geq 10^{-2.5} M\\_{\\odot}$) close to the progenitor ($R\\_{CSM} <10^{15}$ cm) at the time of explosion. After applying a volumetric-correction, we find 36$^{+5}\\_{-7}$\\% of all Type II SN progenitors possess substantial CSM within $10^{15}$ cm at the time of explosion. This high fraction of progenitors with dense CSM, supported by photometric and spectroscopic evidence of previous SNe, reveals mass-loss rates significantly exceeding those measured in local group red supergiants or predicted by current theoretical models.\n\n", "2503.19961": "2025-03-25, **HD 144812: A transition-phase massive star in a binary system**, Michalis Kourniotis et.al., [2503.19961v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19961v1)\n\n In this Letter, we shed light on the evolutionary phase of HD 144812, a Galactic yellow supergiant showing infrared excess that is typically expected for evolved stars undergoing enhanced mass-loss activity. We present high-resolution spectroscopy of the star in the $H-$ and $K-$band acquired with the GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) and further explore multi-band imaging of the wider field of view from the ultraviolet to the radio regime. The IGRINS data reveal several lines from the hydrogen series and iron in a double-peaked emission and we here suggest, that HD 144812 is orbited by a disk-hosting companion. Furthermore, we report emission in the CO band heads of the star that is modeled to arise from a circum-stellar/binary disk (or ring) of ejected gas. The latter consists of material that is expected to have been dredged up from the core of the star to its surface during a prior phase as a red supergiant (RSG). These findings together suggest that HD 144812 is a rare, post-RSG star in a binary system, encouraging further investigation on the effect that the stellar encounters have on triggering instabilities and driving the evolution of the primary star shortly prior to the supernova event.\n\n", "2503.19898": "2025-03-25, **Non-minimally coupled gravity constraints from DESI DR2 data**, Jiaming Pan et.al., [2503.19898v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19898v1)\n\n It has been observed that the hint about phantom crossing in the DESI BAO observation might point to non-minimally coupled gravity. We analyzed DESI DR2 BAO together with CMB and Type Ia supernova data to constrain non-minimal coupling of gravity in the effective field theory (EFT) approach. Using a non-parametric method to infer the EFT functions, we found that with DESI BAO, DESY5 SN, and Planck CMB data the signal for non-minimal coupling reaches $\\sim3\\sigma$. It is found that current data can constrain up to the quadratic order $(n=2)$ if the EFT function representing non-minimal coupling is Taylor expanded as a general function of the dark energy fraction $\\Omega\\_{\\rm{DE}}$, i.e. $\\Omega^{\\text{EFT}}(a)=\\sum\\_{i=0}^{n} c^{\\rm{EFT}}\\_i \\Omega^i\\_{\\text{DE}}(a)$.

Terwel et.al., [2503.19558v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19558v1)\n\n With large-scale surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), it has become possible to obtain a well-sampled light curve spanning the full length of the survey for any discovery within the survey footprint. Similarly, any transient within the footprint that was first detected before the start of the survey will likely have a large number of post-transient observations, making them excellent targets to search for the presence of late-time signals, in particular due to interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). We search for late-time signals in a sample of 7718 transients, mainly supernovae (SNe), which were first detected during the 10 years before the start of ZTF, aiming to find objects showing signs of late-time interaction with CSM. We find one candidate whose late-time signal is best explained by late-time CSM interaction, with the signal being around 300 days after transient discovery. A thin, distant shell containing $\\lesssim5$ M$\\_\\odot$ of material could explain the recovered signal. We also find five objects whose late-time signal is best explained by faint nuclear transients occurring in host nuclei close to the pre-ZTF transient locations. Finally, we find two objects where it is difficult to determine whether the signal is from a nuclear transient or due to late-time CSM interaction $>5$ years after the SN. This study demonstrates the ability of large-scale surveys to find faint transient signals for a variety of objects, uncovering a population of previously unknown sources. However, the large number of non-detections show that strong late-time CSM interaction occurring years after the SN explosion is extremely rare.\n\n", "2503.19442": "2025-03-25, **KiDS-Legacy: Consistency of cosmic shear measurements and joint cosmological constraints with external probes**, Benjamin St\u00f6lzner et.al., [2503.19442v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19442v1)\n\n We present a cosmic shear consistency analysis of the final data release from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-Legacy).
