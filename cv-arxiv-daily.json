In the present work, we consider the standard three neutrino paradigm (referred to as the $(3+0)$ case) and beyond with an additional light sterile neutrino (referred to as the $(3+1)$ case). We consider two configurations : standard energy resolution as in DUNE Technical Design Report (TDR) and improved energy resolution and study the impact of energy resolution in the $(3+0)$ and $(3+1)$ cases. In general, inclusion of subdominant new physics effects spoils the sensitivities. However, improved energy resolution leads to enhancement in sensitivities to the three unknowns in both $(3+0)$ and $(3+1)$ cases.\n\n", "2506.10618": "2025-06-12, **Evading Dark Matter Bounds through NLSP-Assisted Freeze-Out with Long-Lived Signatures**, Sarif Khan et.al., [2506.10618v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10618v1)\n\n In this work, we explore a conversion-driven freeze-out scenario, where the next-to-lightest stable particle (NLSP) sets the dark matter (DM) abundance through the process ``NLSP SM $\\leftrightarrow$ DM SM\". Although DM is produced via a freeze-out mechanism, its interaction strength with the visible sector can range from weak to feeble couplings. This results in a vast, largely unexplored parameter space that evades current direct, indirect, and collider bounds, while remaining testable in the near future. We study this mechanism in the context of an alternative $U(1)\\_{B-L}$ model, where four chiral fermions are required to cancel gauge anomalies, unlike the usual case with three right-handed neutrinos. The observed relic abundance is successfully reproduced within this framework. The viable parameter space can be probed by future direct detection experiments, while remaining inaccessible to indirect searches. Our results show that the DM relic density is highly sensitive to the NLSP-SM interaction strength and the mass difference between the NLSP and DM, but not to the DM-SM direct interaction. For certain parameter choices, the NLSP decays to DM via two or three body processes involving an extra gauge boson and SM particles, leading to long-lived decays outside the CMS or ATLAS detectors at the LHC. In contrast, if the decay proceeds via a CP-odd Higgs, it occurs promptly within the detector. We investigate prospects for detecting such long-lived NLSPs at the proposed MATHUSLA detector, with similar expectations for the ongoing FASER experiment. Finally, we find that choosing arbitrarily small values of the gauge coupling or BSM fermionic mixing angle can violate successful BBN predictions.\n\n", "2506.10551": "2025-06-12, **Impact of angle-dependent recombination on neutrino energy reconstruction in LArTPCs**, J. Vences et.al., [2506.10551v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10551v1)\n\n The technology of Liquid Argon Time-Projection Chambers (LArTPC) plays a very important role in modern neutrino physics. It allows precise tracking and calorimetry in detectors with very large volume and mass. One important component of LArTPC calorimetric energy reconstruction is the electron-ion recombination effect.   Existing experiments have provided constraints to its empirical description, including an explicit dependence on the particle's angle with respect to the TPC's electric field.   In this paper we analyze the impact of angle-dependent recombination models on the reconstruction of neutrino energy in LArTPCs. We examine in detail the predictions of the existing models, showing that there is still considerable uncertainty for the angular dependence prediction at the low values of $dE/dx$ typical of minimum ionizing particles. We apply a simple correction to overcome unphysical predictions in the non-constrained energy loss regions and evaluate the consequences of that in the bias and linearity of electron neutrino energy responses, using generator-level and electron shower simulations for neutrino energies in the range of 0.5-5 GeV. Comparing prediction with and without angular-dependence, we observe an average energy bias between -0.9\\% at 0.5 GeV and -0.6\\% at 5 GeV. While small, these values are close to the typical requirement of 2\\% for the energy scale uncertainty of future experiments, and indicate the need to obtain actual experimental constraints at low $dE/dx$ and take the effect into account in order to achieve the best precision in future LAr TPC electron neutrino calorimetry.\n\n", "2506.09806": "2025-06-11, **Enhancing air-shower observations: Results from an IceCube Surface Array Prototype Station**, Megha Venugopal et.al., [2506.09806v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09806v1)\n\n The Surface Array Enhancement of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is set to equip the existing surface cosmic-ray array of ice-Cherenkov detectors, IceTop, with radio antennas and scintillation detectors. This can lower the energy threshold of detection and increase the measurement accuracy of IceTop. The antenna readout uses a multiplicity trigger from the scintillation detectors.

This paper develops a charged-current quasielastic (CCQE) neutrino-nucleus scattering model to explore the nuclear mean-field dynamics and short-range correlation effects. In this model, the nuclear structure effect is depicted using the scaling function, while the neutrinonucleon interaction is represented by the elementary weak cross section. Results indicate that the double-differential cross section of scattered muon is influenced by the energy and momentum of nucleon in nuclei, and the total cross section depends primarily on the incident neutrino energy. Furthermore, incorporating short-range correlations yields the flux-integrated differential cross sections at high-T region producing larger values, a longer tail, and achieving better experimental consistency. It eventually elucidates the physical relationship between the neutrinonucleus scattering cross section and the variation in incident neutrino energy. The studies in this paper furnishes insights for the research of nucleon dynamics and provides detailed examinations of the neutrino-nucleus scattering mechanism.\n\n", "2506.09694": "2025-06-11, **Searching for sub-TeV IceCube neutrinos correlated to sub-threshold GW events**, Tista Mukherjee et.al., [2506.09694v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09694v1)\n\n The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is active in multi-messenger follow-ups of Gravitational Wave (GW) events. Since the release of the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogue (GWTC)-2.1 by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, sub-threshold GW candidates have been made publicly available. However, they were not followed up in real-time to search for neutrino counterparts. For a deeper understanding of these sub-threshold candidates, archival searches are essential. Finding evidence for a neutrino counterpart will enhance the astrophysical significance of these sub-threshold GW candidates and improve their localisation. Additionally, it will aid in better understanding possible thresholds on specific GW parameters, beyond which the sub-threshold GW candidates could also be promising multi-messenger sources. Thus, the search contributes to the ongoing efforts to establish correlations between astrophysical neutrinos and GW sources.

Here, we present a self-contained calculation of this process consisting of a next-to-leading order semi-inclusive charmed-hadron production in the SACOT-$\\chi$ general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme, followed by a semi-leptonic decay of the charmed hadron. We find that invoking the SACOT-$\\chi$ scheme introduces modifications up to $20 \\, \\%$ in comparison to our previous esimates, where only kinematic mass effects were considered through the slow-rescaling variable. We reiterate our earlier observation that the effective acceptance correction - typically used in global PDF fits as a simplifying approximation - depends on the perturbative order, PDFs, scales, and also on the treatment of heavy-quark effects. We find good agreement with the corresponding data from the NuTeV experiment.\n\n", "2506.09481": "2025-06-11, **Imaging systematics induced by galaxy sub-sample fluctuation: new systematics at second order**, Hui Kong et.al., [2506.09481v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09481v1)\n\n Imaging systematics refers to the inhomogeneous distribution of a galaxy sample caused by varying observing conditions and astrophysical foregrounds. Current mitigation methods correct the galaxy density fluctuations, caused by imaging systematics assuming that all galaxies in a sample have the same galaxy density fluctuations. Under this assumption, the corrected sample cannot perfectly recover the true correlation function. We name this effect sub-sample systematics. For a galaxy sample, even if its overall sample statistics (redshift distribution n(z), galaxy bias b(z)), are accurately measured, n(z), b(z) can still vary across the observed footprint. It makes the correlation function amplitude of galaxy clustering higher, while correlation functions for galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear do not have noticeable change. Such a combination could potentially degenerate with physical signals on small angular scales, such as the amplitude of galaxy clustering, the impact of neutrino mass on the matter power spectrum, etc. Sub-sample systematics, cannot be corrected using imaging systematics mitigation approaches that rely on the cross-correlation signal between imaging systematics maps and the observed galaxy density field. In this paper, we derive formulated expressions of sub-sample systematics, demonstrating its fundamental difference with other imaging systematics. We also provide several toy models to visualize this effect. Finally, we discuss the estimation and mitigation of sub-sample systematics, with a combination of synthetic source injection (SSI), analytical benchmarking on SSI, and self-organizing map.\n\n", "2506.09322": "2025-06-11, **Searching for beyond-Standard-Model solar neutrino interactions using directional detectors**, Anirudh Chandra Shekar et.al., [2506.09322v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09322v1)\n\n Micro-pattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs) are a class of technologies that enable the full three-dimensional spatial reconstruction of ionisation tracks from nuclear and electron recoils in gas. Anticipating near-future 30 m$^3$-scale time projection chambers with MPGD-based readout, we forecast the sensitivity of such directionally-sensitive low-energy recoil detectors to neutrino interactions beyond the Standard Model. We work in the framework of neutrino non-standard interactions (NSIs), and calculate the combined recoil energy-angle distributions of the electron recoil signal generated by solar neutrinos in atmospheric-pressure He:CF$\\_4$ gas. We estimate the expected exclusion limits that such an experiment could place on various NSI parameters, as well as the mass and coupling of a new light mediator that interacts with electrons and neutrinos. We find that with an achievable background reduction of around a factor of ten from current estimates for a 30 m$^3$ optical-readout detector using this gas mixture, sensitivity to NSI parameters would already approach Borexino's sensitivity. Directionality also allows for event-by-event neutrino energy reconstruction, which would provide a means to resolve some parameter degeneracies present in the modified neutrino cross section in this formalism.

In addition, small-scale structure issues can be addressed by dark matter self-interactions with a cross section comparable to that of QCD. Both observations point to a GeV-scale dark QCD sector. In this letter, guided by these two coincidences, we investigate how a chiral dark QCD model with a MeV-scale dark photon can resolve the core-cusp problem.

The device is designed to recognize the passage of highly penetrating and dense particles in a wide range of mass and charge states such as Strange Quark Matter (SQM). These particles, traveling at speeds typical of gravitationally bound objects in the galaxy - around 250 km/s - are also possible candidates of dark matter. The ability of SQM-ISS to identify penetrating, massive and slow-moving objects allows it also to be sensitive to the detection of primordial black holes.

Keim et.al., [2506.10220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10220v1)\n\n A unique linear trail of diffuse galaxies was recently identified in the NGC 1052 field. This trail includes the remarkable, ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and DF4 which lack dark matter and host unusually luminous globular clusters. It has been proposed that the trail formed via a high-speed collision between two gas-rich dwarf galaxies. This scenario predicts that the trail galaxies are kinematically connected and follow a specific trend in radial velocity as a function of position, based on the known velocities and positions of DF2 and DF4. To test this hypothesis, we measured radial velocities for seven additional galaxies on the trail. While the galaxies' low surface brightnesses presented observational challenges, we employ several methods to obtain measurements for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses up to 28.6 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, including a narrow slit placed over globular clusters and a novel wide slit mode on Keck/LRIS, as well as a 'light bucket' mode on Keck/KCWI. We find that five of our seven targets follow the precise velocity trend predicted by DF2 and DF4, to a degree with just a 2% chance of randomly occurring. Moreover, the trail galaxies' radial velocities are significantly higher than those of the NGC 1052 group, setting it apart as a separate, kinematically connected system. Our findings support the theory that this trail of galaxies, including DF2 and DF4, formed together in a single event.

For some AGN, the mapping of multiple emission lines allows us to measure the enclosed mass within different radii from the central SMBH, which allows us to infer or constrain the dark matter density profile on sub-pc scales.

For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\\gamma \\sim 1.6$, consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by stellar heating processes.

Interestingly, the strongest evidence for a dark matter component arises from the farthest object considered, 3C 390.

Recent studies suggest that gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers can also detect bosonic ULDM fields, which would produce monochromatic signals resembling those from gravitational waves (GWs). Distinguishing between these potential origins therefore would be essential. In this work, we develop a method to address this challenge for space-based GW interferometers (such as LISA and Taiji) by utilizing the null-response channel (NRC) in interferometric combinations, a channel constructed to have zero response to a specific type of source from a given direction. We find that while the GW NRC remains blind to GWs from a specific direction, it still responds to ULDM, particularly at frequencies above the interferometer's critical frequency. The ULDM NRC exhibits similar behavior. Based on these observations, we outline a test procedure to discriminate between signal origins.

Both resonant-mode enhancement and large-momentum-transfer techniques result in a greater number of light pulses, making high pulse fidelity during atom-light interactions imperative. At the same time, increasing the number of diamonds in vertical configurations leads to taller atomic fountains, which consequently reduces the available distance between interferometers. As a result, the number of diamonds, large-momentum-transfer pulses, and the fountain height are interdependent parameters that must be carefully balanced. In this work, we present optimal configurations for multi-diamond geometries, explicitly accounting for the spatial extent of a single interferometer, considering constraints imposed by the baseline dimensions and atomic losses due to imperfect pulses. We provide practical analytical relations to estimate the optimal number of pulses that should be applied. Many proposals beyond demonstrator experiments require pulse numbers that demand efficiencies not yet demonstrated with state-of-the-art momentum transfer techniques.
