Review of forecast constraints on dark energy and modified gravity**, Euclid Collaboration et.al., [2512.09748v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09748v1)\n\n The Euclid mission has been designed to provide, as one of its main deliverables, information on the nature of the gravitational interaction, which determines the expansion of the Universe and the formation of structures. Thus, Euclid has the potential to test deviations from general relativity that will allow us to shed light on long-lasting problems in the standard cosmological model, $\u039b$CDM. Euclid will mainly do this by using two complementary probes: weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. In this paper we review pre-launch Euclid analyses for dark energy and modified gravity. These include forecast constraints with future Euclid data on cosmological parameters for different cosmological models, such as a time-varying dark energy component, phenomenological modifications of the perturbation sector and specific modified gravity models, with further extensions that include neutrino physics and the coupling to the electromagnetic sector through the fine-structure constant. We review the study of the impact of nonlinear clustering methods on beyond-$\u039b$CDM constraints with Euclid. This is of fundamental importance to efficiently predict the large-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos, given that we will have access to a wealth of information on scales beyond the linear regime. We inspect the extension of theoretical predictions for observable quantities in alternative cosmologies to $\u039b$CDM at fully nonlinear scales by means of $N$-body simulations. We discuss the impact of relativistic corrections in extended cosmological models.

In a previous work [Nucleon decays into three leptons: noncontact contributions, arXiv:2512.02692.], two of us analyzed the noncontact contributions to these decays arising from dimension-6 (dim-6) operators within the low-energy effective field theory (LEFT), and found that they are severely suppressed due to stringent constraints on these dim-6 operators. In this work, we continue this endeavor by systematically investigating the contact contributions originating from dim-9 LEFT operators. We construct a complete basis of dim-9 operators relevant to these processes, and subsequently match them onto chiral perturbation theory to calculate their decay widths. By employing existing experimental data, we derive stringent constraints on the relevant operators. In addition, we present the analysis of an ultraviolet-complete model to demonstrate its connection with our theoretical framework, thereby facilitating further studies of these exotic nucleon decays in upcoming neutrino experiments with large fiducial masses.\n\n", "2512.09063": "2025-12-09, **A novel two loop inverse seesaw model**, Gonzalo Ben\u00edtez-Irarr\u00e1zabal et.al., [2512.09063v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09063v1)\n\n We propose a Standard Model (SM) extension where neutrinos get masses through a two-loop inverse seesaw mechanism. This naturally explains the smallness of the neutrino masses and allows seesaw mediators to be at the TeV scale with testable phenomenology. The model adds two real singlet scalars and four electrically neutral leptons to the SM. The extension considers the existence of two global Abelian symmetries, a continuous $U(1)$ and a discrete $Z\\_3$. The latter, remains unbroken after spontaneous symmetry breaking and forbids tree-level and one-loop neutrino masses, and stabilizes the dark matter (DM) candidates. This setup accommodates neutrino-oscillation data, yields two pseudo-Dirac heavy pairs with small active-sterile mixing, and predicts an effective Majorana mass $m\\_{ee}$ in the $2.1$-$4.4$ meV range for normal ordering. Charged-lepton flavor violation is naturally suppressed yet testable: for a representative benchmark we obtain BR$(\u03bc\\to e \u03b3)\\simeq 1.6 \\times 10^{-14}$, with correlated signals in $\u03bc\\to eee$ and $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion within next-generation experimental reach.

The B-L can naturally be a bulk gauge symmetery leading to a global symmetry on the SM brane, and have its gauge anomaly canceled by charged bulk modes. This naturally leads to the existence of 3 right-handed neutrinos propagating in the dark dimension. Allowing for Higgsing of B-L by a bulk scalar at the Higgs scale, results in a massive gauge field with $m\\_{B-L}\\sim 100$ GeV and weak coupling $g\\_{B-L}\\sim 10^{-10}$ which is allowed by current bounds.

We consider a framework in which the hidden sector is conformal in the ultraviolet and the compositeness scale lies below the weak scale. If the lightest composite state in the hidden sector is a scalar, its decay rate back to the Standard Model is suppressed by angular momentum considerations and can naturally be small, giving rise to long-lived particle signals.

Future CE$\u03bd$NS experiments will foreseeable lead to precision measurements which will be a powerful tool to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate possible deviations from unitarity in the $3\\times3$ leptonic mixing matrix that controls the propagation of active neutrinos. Such deviations may originate from the mixing with additional gauge singlet fermions and depending on their mass scale and mixing, the resulting phenomenology can differ substantially. We explore two well-motivated regimes: the \\textit{seesaw limit}, where the new fermions are heavy and kinematically inaccessible, leading to effective deviations from unitarity in the active sector; and the \\textit{light sterile limit}, where they are light enough to be produced and participate in neutrino propagation and scattering processes. We show how these scenarios modify both CE$\u03bd$NS and elastic neutrino--electron scattering (E$\u03bde$S), and we present the corresponding sensitivity projections for a future CE$\u03bd$NS reactor experiment obtained by upscaling the CONUS+ experiment, which reported the first observation of reactor CE$\u03bd$NS.

In this work, we explore how this fog is modified when either neutrinos or DM interact with nuclei through a new scalar, vector, or axial-vector interaction, considering both heavy and light mediators. Using the latest nuclear-recoil data from XENONnT, which show indications of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from $^8$B solar neutrinos, we derive new strong bounds on light mediator couplings. We find that these limits are significantly more stringent when the mediator couples to DM, rather than when new physics affects only neutrino interactions. Building on these results, we recompute the expected neutrino fog and compare it with the corresponding constraints on spin-independent and spin-dependent DM-nucleon interactions. We show that the morphology of the neutrino fog can be markedly modified if either neutrinos or DM interact with nuclei through light mediators, even in light of these recent constraints.\n\n", "2512.08822": "2025-12-09, **A search for successful and choked jets in nearby broad-lined Type Ic supernovae**, Tanner O'Dwyer et.al., [2512.08822v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08822v1)\n\n The observational link between long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and broad-lined stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) is well established. Significant progress has been made in constraining what fraction of SNe Ic-BL may power high- or low-luminosity GRBs when viewed at small off-axis angles. However, the GRB-SN connection still lacks a complete understanding in the broader context of massive-star evolution and explosion physics. Models predict a continuum of outcomes for the fastest ejecta, from choked to ultra-relativistic jets, and observations from radio to X-rays are key to probing these scenarios across a range of viewing angles and velocities. Here, we present results from a coordinated radio-to-X-ray campaign targeting nearby (z<=0.1) SNe Ic-BL designed to explore this diversity. With eight new radio-monitored events and updated data for one previously observed SN, we further tighten constraints on the fraction of SNe Ic-BL as relativistic as SN 1998bw/GRB 980425. We identify SN 2024rjw as a new radio-loud event likely powered by strong interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), and add evidence supporting a similar interpretation for SN 2020jqm. We also establish new limits on the properties of radio-emitting ejecta with velocities consistent with cocoons from choked jets, highlighting SN 2022xxf as a promising cocoon-dominated candidate.

Two limiting cases are considered: (i) protons are in the normal state and (ii) protons are in the superconducting state. In both cases, the dominant contribution to the bremsstrahlung emissivity $Q^{\\mathrm{em}}\\_{\\mathrm{Br}}$ comes from the transverse part of in-medium electromagnetic interactions.

In contrast, for superconducting and superfluid matter, the neutrino emission processes involving nucleons are suppressed and $Q^{\\mathrm{em}}\\_{\\mathrm{Br}}$ due to lepton collisions provides the residual contribution to the neutrino emissivity of neutron star core matter.

In this work, we move beyond the two-parameter Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) form adopted in recent DESI analyses and re-examine neutrino mass constraints using a flexible four-parameter dark energy equation of state (4pDE). We implement the 4pDE model in a modified version of CLASS and perform a full MCMC analysis using Planck, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon+ data. Relative to our previous 4pDE study based on pre-DESI BAO datasets, the inclusion of DESI DR2 substantially tightens the constraints on the transition parameters while still yielding a relaxed neutrino-mass bound compared to $\u039b$CDM, $\\sum m\\_\u03bd< 0.101$ eV ($95\\%$ C.L.).

To explain the observed lepton mass spectra and flavor mixing patterns, flavor symmetry plays a crucial and unique role. In this paper, we propose a useful symmetry-breaking scheme by applying $S\\_{3L} \\times S\\_{3R} \\rightarrow S\\_{2L} \\times S\\_{2R} \\rightarrow \\emptyset$ within both charged-lepton and neutrino sectors at the mass-matrix level.

It is shown that all the three scenarios are in good agreement with current neutrino oscillation data.

In superluminal scenarios, neutrinos can decay through vacuum $e^-e^+$ pair emission or neutrino splitting. Previous analyses of the KM3-230213A event relied on simplified survival-probability estimates and, in some cases, used inaccurate decay-width expressions or neglected redshift and threshold effects. In this work we present a unified and self-consistent framework that corrects these issues and applies to both the energy-independent ($n=0$) and quadratic ($n=2$) superluminal cases. We collect and recast the decay-width and threshold expressions, clarify their flavor dependence, and include a consistent treatment of cosmological propagation. We also assess the impact of cascade regeneration and show that cascade effects are negligible for the purpose of setting LIV bounds.

In particular, GWs induced by primordial isocurvature perturbations encode information of novel dynamics beyond the standard $\u039b$CDM model. Existing studies of isocurvature induced GWs focus on a particular type: cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature. In this work, we present a more comprehensive study of four kinds of isocurvature involving CDM, baryons, neutrinos and free-streaming dark radiation (DR). We first reformulate initial conditions of isocurvature with coupled neutrinos because modes relevant for observations at Pulsar Timing Arrays enter the horizon before neutrino decoupling. With these new initial conditions, neutrino isocurvature is phenomenologically similar to CDM isocurvature up to an overall coefficient, which leads to an interesting conversion of isocurvature between radiation and matter sectors. We then find that the spectrum of isocurvature induced GWs from free-streaming DR is qualitatively different than that from CDM due to the presence of anisotropic stress. Unlike GWs induced by CDM isocurvature that are suppressed at high frequencies due to matter density being suppressed at early times, DR isocurvature induced GWs is proportional to the constant ratio between DR density and total radiation. Finally, we utilize two general parametrizations of the isocurvature power spectrum: a delta function and a broken power law, and derive novel constraints with recent NANOGrav data.

Using the model variations in FLAMINGO, we further explore how the signals depend on cosmology and feedback modelling, and we predict cross-correlations between some of the signals that differ significantly from those in previous mocks.

This sudden kick generates a large ALP velocity near the onset of EWPT enabling the broadening of relic satisfied parameter space and predict a complementary stochastic gravitational-wave signal from the underlying first-order transition.

Despite this early prominence, no detailed lensing analyses have been carried out for more than fifteen years. We here study this cluster using JWST imaging obtained as part of the SLICE program, complemented by archival HST and X-ray observations. JWST data reveal ten new multiply imaged systems and enable the identification of conjugate substructures in several of the sixteen systems, significantly increasing the number of strong lensing constraints. Using these data, we construct a parametric mass model with Lenstool and extend it by explicitly incorporating the Chandra data in a combined strong lensing+X-ray fit. Our best-fit model reproduces the multiple images with an RMS of 0.4\" while simultaneously matching the X-ray data. The dark matter distribution is unimodal and centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, with a large core radius of 83+-5kpc, consistent with values reported in other strong lensing clusters. The strong lensing constraints require the inclusion of an external shear component which position angle points unambiguously towards a nearby (~1Mpc), well defined mass concentration at the same redshift in the North-West, for which we propose the naming AC114b. The spatial coverage of the XMM-Newton data encompasses the whole structure, allowing us to probe the X-ray properties of the companion cluster and the thermodynamics of AC114, providing evidence for a major merger, in line with previous signatures seen in Chandra, radio and optical spectroscopic data.

Compact stars, particularly neutron stars, offer unique astrophysical laboratories for probing such fundamental properties under extreme densities. The presence of a fermionic DM admixed with nuclear matter can modify the equation of state, thereby affecting observable quantities such as the mass-radius (M-R) relation and tidal deformability. In this work, we investigate how the intrinsic particle nature of fermionic DM influences neutron star structure. Within a relativistic mean-field framework extended by a scalar (or Higgs like) portal coupling between DM and nucleons, we construct self-consistent equation of states for both Dirac and Majorana cases and solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to obtain stellar configurations. Owing to the difference in internal degrees of freedom, Dirac DM (four degrees of freedom) generally softens the equation of state more strongly than Majorana DM (two degrees of freedom), leading to smaller radii and lower maximum masses.

This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology.

Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G\\_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G\\_e\\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G\\_e> G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era.\n\n", "2512.09342": "2025-12-10, **The stellar and dark matter distributions in elliptical galaxies measured by stacked weak gravitational lensing**, Momoka Fujikawa et.al., [2512.09342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09342v1)\n\n We investigate stellar mass and central dark matter density profiles of photometric luminous red galaxies with stellar masses of $\\sim10^{10}-10^{12}M\\_\\odot$ using weak gravitational lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program data obtained with the Subaru Telescope.

The internal structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) is tightly linked to the assembly history and physical processes in groups and clusters, but the role of recent accretion in shaping these profiles has not been fully explored.   Aims. We investigate to what extent mass accretion accounts for the variability in ICM density and thermodynamic profiles, and what can present-day structures reveal about their formation histories.   Methods. We analyze a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation including gas cooling but no feedback, to isolate the effects of heating from structure formation. Median profiles of ICM quantities are introduced as a robust description of the bulk ICM. We then examine correlations between mass accretion rates or assembly indicators with the profiles of temperature, entropy, pressure, gas and dark-matter density, as well as their scatter.   Results. Accretion in the last dynamical time strongly lowers central gas densities, while leaving dark matter largely unaffected, producing a distinct signature in the baryon depletion function. Pressure and entropy show the clearest dependence on accretion, whereas temperature is less sensitive. The radii of steepest entropy, temperature, and pressure shift inward by $\\sim (10-20)\\%$ between high- and low-accretion subsamples. Assembly-state indicators are also related to the location of these features, and accretion correlates with the parameters of common fitting functions for density, pressure, and entropy.

The dependence of the quasinormal spectrum on $a$ is moderate for the fundamental modes and even weaker for the overtones, which approach one another in the complex-frequency plane as the halo parameter increases. No enhancement or rapid growth of overtone amplitudes is observed, indicating that the halo does not induce the type of strong near-horizon effects characteristic of quantum-corrected or exotic compact objects.

They point to the possibility of the presence of a new Higgs particle in the spectrum, in addition to the already observed 125 GeV state. In particular, there are excesses involving a diphoton resonance at invariant masses of about 95 GeV, 152 GeV and 650 GeV and an extra scalar might accompany the recent observation of a toponium at a mass of about 350 GeV. Several interpretations of these excesses have been attempted in extensions of the Standard Model. In this paper, we aim to explain them in the framework of a two Higgs doublet model supplemented by a relatively light pseudoscalar Higgs boson $a$ which would correspond to the putative resonance in most cases. This realistic 2HD+a scenario is attractive as it is has the virtue to pass all experimental constraints from high-precision experiments and collider searches and, at the same time, to allow for a viable explanation of the dark matter in the universe. We first update the present constraints on the model, in particular taking into account the latest results on dark matter and Higgs searches, as well the high-precision measurements, including those from Higgs and flavor physics.

A critical issue may arise in interaction between $XHe$ and atomic nuclei due to the unshielded nuclear attraction, which could destabilize the dark atom's bound state. To resolve this, we propose a novel numerical quantum mechanical approach that accounts for self-consistent electromagnetic-nuclear couplings. This method addresses to eliminate the inherent complexity of the $XHe$-nucleus three-body system, where analytical solutions are intractable. By reconstructing the effective interaction potential - including dipole Coulomb barrier and shallow potential well - we demonstrate how these features lead to the formation of $XHe$-nucleus bound states and modulate low-energy capture processes. Our model enables validation of the dark atom hypothesis, particularly in interpreting experimental anomalies like annual modulation signals observed in DAMA/LIBRA.

On the other hand, such models offer greater flexibility to probe the DE sector in more detail. With the rapid advancement of astronomical surveys and the availability of diverse datasets, it is timely to examine whether current combined observations can effectively constrain an extended parameter space in DE models. This article investigates a four-parameter dynamical dark energy (DDE) model that spans a broad region of the universe's expansion history through four key parameters: the present-day value of the DE equation of state ($w\\_0$), its initial value ($w\\_m$), the scale factor depicting transition from $w\\_m$ to $w\\_0$ occurs ($a\\_t$), and the steepness of this transition ($\u0394\\_{\\rm de}$).

Our results show that constraining all four parameters remains difficult: $a\\_t$ is not constrained by any dataset, while the remaining three parameters can be constrained only when all observational probes are combined (with the exception of DESY5). The results further show that DE has a quintessential nature at present ($w\\_0 > -1$), while $w\\_m$ is negative, indicating a phantom-like behaviour at early times.

Such a model offers solutions that have $w \\sim -1$ and are decelerating without requiring a phantom like equation of state. The present day value of the equation of state parameter is treated as a free parameter; however, for the reference model, we fix its present value to $-1$. The analysis is carried out using the latest Supernovae dataset (Pantheon+) and BAO measurements from DESI. The results show that both types of datasets consistently predict a turnaround in the equation of state, regardless of whether $w\\_{\u03c60}$ is treated as a free parameter or fixed to $-1$. The corresponding deceleration parameter also exhibits a future turnaround for both datasets when $w\\_{\u03c60}$ is free.

Because magnetic diffusion is usually much faster than system evolution, ancient fields cannot explain the present magnetization of planets, stars, and galaxies. Instead, self-sustaining dynamos, which convert fluid motion into magnetic energy, offer the most robust explanation. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations are essential to understanding this phenomenon. This thesis uses numerical models of self-excited dynamos in two contexts: the interstellar medium (ISM) and the interiors of gas giant planets. First, I use 3D MHD simulations with the Pencil Code to study magnetic growth from irrotational, subsonic expansion flows, a simplified representation of supernova-driven motions in the ISM. These curl-free flows mimic stellar explosions and winds, drive turbulence, and seed magnetic amplification. The second part examines planetary dynamos. I outline the properties of planetary magnetic fields and their modeling through convection in spherical shells. Although many exoplanets are known, their magnetic fields remain difficult to detect, but may be observable through coherent radio emission with new low-frequency instruments. Using 3D dynamo simulations with the MagIC code, coupled to thermodynamic profiles from MESA-based evolution models, I study the magnetic evolution of cold gas giants. The models show a slow decline in field strength, a shift from multipolar to dipolar states, and clear evolutionary trends in dynamo behavior. I also investigate hot Jupiters, where strong irradiation alters convection and rotation. Most remain fast rotators, but massive, distant planets may enter different regimes. When heating is concentrated in outer layers, convection in the dynamo region weakens, reducing expected field strengths and helping explain the absence of confirmed detections in past radio surveys.\n\n", "2512.09724": "2025-12-10, **Bayesian Model Selection with an Application to Cosmology**, Nikoloz Gigiberia et.al., [2512.09724v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09724v1)\n\n We investigate cosmological parameter inference and model selection from a Bayesian perspective.

The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.\n\n", "2512.09353": "2025-12-10, **Bimetric MOND as a framework for variable-$G$ theories -- local systems and cosmology**, Mordehai Milgrom et.al., [2512.09353v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09353v1)\n\n Bimetric MOND (BIMOND) is used as a platform for variable-$G$ theories that have MOND-specific idiosyncrasies. E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G\\_e\\approx 2\u03c0G$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\\approx 2\u03c0\\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G\\_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G\\_e\\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G\\_e> G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era.\n\n", "2512.09223": "2025-12-10, **An extragalactic gamma-ray binary formed in supernova 2022jli**, Pengfei Zhang et.al., [2512.09223v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09223v1)\n\n On May 5 2022, a type Ic supernova (SN) explosion SN~2022jli was discovered. This SN showed additional optical emissions, which were found to exhibit 12.4-day periodic undulations and concordant periodic velocity shifts. These key features likely indicate a compact object in a binary system was formed. A faint $\u03b3$-ray source was also detected at the position of the SN and upon checking the $\u03b3$-ray photons' arrival times, it was revealed that the same 12.4-day periodicity was likely present. Here we report our detailed analysis results for the $\u03b3$-ray source. Not only was the $\u03b3$-ray emission detectable for $\\sim$1.5\\,years since the discovery time, but a strong modulation at period 12.5\\,day was also clearly determined. Considering the newly formed compact object to be a neutron star or a stellar-mass black hole, the putative binary, having an orbital period of 12.5\\,day, is likely the first extragalactic high-energy system detected.

As such, they enable the acquisition of otherwise inaccessible information about nascent extrasolar systems. The discovery of the third interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, provides an opportunity to explore the properties of a small body from another solar system and to compare it to the small bodies in our own. To that end, we present spectrophotometric observations of 3I/ATLAS taken using the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph on the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope. Our data includes the earliest $\u03bb\\leq3800$ A spectrum of 3I/ATLAS, obtained $\\sim$12.5 hours after the discovery announcement. Later spectra confirm previously reported cometary activity, including Ni and CN emission. The data show wavelength-varying spectral slopes ($S\\approx($0\\%-29\\%)/1000 A, depending on wavelength range) throughout the pre-perihelion ($r\\_h=4.4$-$2.5$ au) approach of 3I/ATLAS.

However, very few mid- and late-type B stars with rapid rotation have been demonstrated to be post-interaction products, despite a growing sample of SB1 binaries among stars within this range of spectral types. By considering the currently available information over the entire range of rapidly rotating B-type binaries, we argue that a significant fraction of the mid- and late-type rapid rotators found in binaries are also likely the result of past mass transfer episodes. The observed properties of this sample are compared to the predictions from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code (BPASS), with attention given to the expected evolutionary pathways of stripped stars and the stellar and binary properties of both components of post-interaction systems across a range of initial conditions. Prospects for directly detecting and characterizing the stripped cores of the previous mass donors in such systems are described, and the implications for the role of binary interaction in causing rapid rotation are discussed. An accurate description of prevalence of binary interaction, the physics of mass transfer, and the post-interaction configuration of systems over a range of initial conditions has far-reaching implications including double-degenerate binaries and their eventual mergers, the output of ionizing UV flux of stellar populations, and the supernova explosions that can arise from stripped or rapidly-rotating progenitors.\n\n", "2512.08528": "2025-12-09, **Dark Photons in the Early Universe: From Thermal Production to Cosmological Constraints**, Xun-Jie Xu et.al., [2512.08528v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08528v1)\n\n Dark photons, a generic class of light gauge bosons that interact with the Standard Model (SM) exclusively through kinetic mixing, arise naturally in many gauge extensions of the SM. Motivated by these theoretical considerations, we present a comprehensive analysis of their thermal production in the early universe. Our calculation covers a broad range of dark photon masses from 0.1 keV to 100 MeV and include inverse decay, annihilation, and semi-Compton processes. Wherever possible, we present analytical estimates of the production rates and yields, and verify their accuracy numerically. For dark photons lighter than twice the electron masses (around 1 MeV), we find that our analytical estimate of the freeze-in yield based on resonant production is very accurate, implying that off-resonance contributions can be neglected in practice. For heavy dark photons, although this conclusion no longer holds, we derive an interesting ratio, $4\u03c0e/27\\approx0.14$, with $e$ the coupling constant of QED, that can be used to estimate the relative importance of on- and off-resonance contributions. Finally, using the calculated abundance of dark photons in the early universe, we derive cosmological constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing. Compared with bounds from stellar cooling and supernovae, the cosmological constraints are most stringent in the mass range from 0.1 MeV to 6 MeV, within which kinetic mixing at the level of $10^{-12}\\sim10^{-10}$ can be probed.\n\n", "2512.08231": "2025-12-09, **The Head-on Collision of a Neutron Star with a White Dwarf**, Zong-kai Peng et.al., [2512.08231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08231v1)\n\n We have computed the physical processes involved in a head-on collision between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD). The outcomes of such collisions vary depending on the mass and type of the WD. We have separately examined the dynamical processes for collisions between NSs and helium WDs (He-WDs), carbon-oxygen WDs (CO-WDs), and oxygen-neon WDs (ONe-WDs). We aim to investigate whether the collision can trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD, and if not, whether the NS can remain bound within the WD to form a Thorne-Zytkow-like object (TZlO). For a thermonuclear explosion to occur, at least two conditions must be satisfied: (i) the collision-induced temperature must reach the ignition threshold of the relevant nuclear reactions, and (ii) the burning material must remain in a degenerate state. For different types of WDs, there exist parameter ranges where both conditions are fulfilled, implying that NS-WD collisions can indeed induce thermonuclear explosions, leading to sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae or other exotic optical transients powered by thermonuclear explosion. On the other hand, the formation of a TZlO requires that the WD material exerts sufficient drag on the NS to prevent its escape, while the interaction must not trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD. Our results indicate that such conditions can be realized in the case of low-mass CO-WDs and low-mass ONe-WDs, provided that the viscous coefficient is sufficiently large.\n\n", "2512.08212": "2025-12-09, **Supernovae Shock Breakout from Red Supergiants in Two Dimensions**, Wun-Yi Chen et.al., [2512.08212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08212v1)\n\n We present new two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of supernova shock breakout from red supergiants using the $\\texttt{CASTRO}$ code. Our progenitors are 20 and 25 M$\\_{\\odot}$ solar-metallicity stars evolved from the zero-age main sequence with $\\texttt{MESA}$ and exploded in one dimension using $\\texttt{FLASH}$. We consider a range of circumstellar media (CSM) produced by stellar winds to investigate how pre-explosion mass-loss affects shock breakout. The multigroup flux-limited diffusion scheme in $\\texttt{CASTRO}$ captures the interaction between the explosion shock, its radiation precursor, and the surrounding CSM. We find that strong radiation precursors, generated by radiation leakage behind the shock, can drive fluid instabilities and move the effective photosphere outward before the shock reaches the stellar surface. The resulting breakout emissions reach peak luminosities of ${\\sim}10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with full-width half-maximum durations of 1-3 hr, which are much dimmer and longer than those from blue supergiants. The light-curve colors gradually evolve from blue to red after the peak. The 25 M$\\_{\\odot}$ model with explosion energy $E \\sim 1.69\\times10^{51}$ erg produces ${\\sim}$10-30\\% higher maximum luminosity than the 20 M$\\_{\\odot}$ model with $E \\sim 1.09\\times10^{51}$ erg. The dense CSM further extends the breakout rise time by increasing the photon diffusion. These results provide new constraints on red supergiant atmospheres and mass-loss histories prior to core collapse.\n\n"}}
