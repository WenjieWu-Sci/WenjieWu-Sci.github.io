Two pairs of ears, a pair of blowouts in the north and south along the long axis of this SNR, and a pair of dents compose the point symmetric morphology. The fact that the symmetry axes of two pairs include pairs of opposite structural features in the inner ejecta implies that the shaping is by jets and not due to an interaction with an ambient material. While the JJEM predicts such morphologies, the competing neutrino-driven mechanism cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies.

A comprehensive collection of channels is taken into account, ranging from those featuring $W$ and $W\\_R$ mediation to those induced by scalar mixing and gauge/scalar boson fusion, with connections to the mechanism of neutrino mass origin. The emerging signatures feature possibly multiple displaced heavy neutrinos that are in some cases accompanied by prompt activity and forward leptons. We derive the corresponding total production rates and differential distributions, which allow us to differentiate the channels and have analytical estimates of the signal yield. We then develop realistic estimates of the selection efficiencies using a dedicated vertexing algorithm which establishes the displaced decay positions and supplies a reliable proxy for reconstructing the full four-momenta of long-lived particles. This allows to determine the realistic reaches in the parameter space of the Left-Right symmetric model across the various channels, and we show that these can strongly surpass the LHC ones, demonstrating that future lepton colliders are sensitive to left-right symmetry breaking scales in the deep multi-TeV regime.\n\n", "2602.09025": "2026-02-09, **An Exploration of the Equation of State Dependence of Core-Collapse Supernova Explosion Outcomes and Signatures**, Aleksandr Rusakov et.al., [2602.09025v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09025v1)\n\n We explore, using a state-of-the-art simulation code in 3D and to late enough times to witness final observables, the dependence of core-collapse supernova explosions on the nuclear equation of state. Going beyond questions of explodability, we compare final explosion energies, nucleosynthetic yields, recoil kicks, and gravitational-wave and neutrino signatures using the SFHo and DD2 nuclear equations of state (EOS) for a 9-$M\\_{\\odot}$/solar-metallicity progenitor star. The DD2 EOS is stiffer and has a lower effective nucleon mass. The result is a more extended protoneutron star (PNS) and lower central densities. As a consequence, the mean neutrino energies, final explosion energy, and recoil kick speed are lower. Moreover, the evolution of PNS convection differs between the two EOS models in significant ways. This translates in part into interestingly altered neutrino ``light\" curves and noticeably altered gravitational-wave signal strengths and frequency characteristics that may be diagnostic. The faster exploding model (SFHo) yields slightly more neutron-rich ejecta and more species with atomic weights between 60 and 90 and a weak r-process. However, this is merely a preliminary study. The next step is a more comprehensive and multi-progenitor set of 3D supernova simulations for various EOSes to late times when the observables have asymptoted.

The Borexino's unprecedented sensitivity to solar neutrinos, derived from its low background and precision spectral measurements, enables stringent constraints on potential deviations from the standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation paradigm. This work presents an update on the analysis of flavor-diagonal NSI using the full Borexino Phase-III data set, extending the study previously reported in Constraints on flavor-diagonal non-standard neutrino interactions from Borexino Phase-II (JHEP 2020, 38). The updated analysis incorporates the extended temporal and statistical coverage of Phase-III. The results indicate improved sensitivity to the diagonal NSI parameters, with constraints exceeding those obtained in Phase-II. Furthermore, a more general analysis that includes all possible off-diagonal NSI terms is presented for the first time, providing a comprehensive exploration of the NSI parameter space associated with the flavors of the incoming and outgoing neutrinos.

These processes are being fully integrated into a detector-level simulation chain, enabling realistic detector signal modeling beyond existing estimates. The framework enables sensitivity forecasts for both direct detection and constraints based on time delays relative to the neutrino burst, across a range of ALP emission models.

We show that it is possible to realize this by a UV-complete model based on a two Higgs doublet model. The neutral spin-zero Higgs bosons (scalar or pseudoscalar) mediating dark matter interaction, can also produce some effects at low energies which modify the SM predictions significantly. In particular we find large testable consequences for $B\\_s - \\bar B\\_s$ mixing due to splitting of scalar and pseudoscalar masses, and also neutron EDM.

Within the light Majorana neutrino exchange mechanism, the decay amplitudes are found to emerge at the one-loop level, representing the long-range contribution. The extended-on-mass-shell scheme is employed to renormalize the one-loop amplitudes and restore consistent chiral power counting. Consequently, the differential decay rates for all accessible hyperon $0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2$ channels are predicted and the corresponding branching ratios are more than 20 orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental upper bounds. Interestingly, it is found that the leading contribution to hyperon $0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2$ decay is actually from short-range counterterm operators, as required by the renormalization argument.

In this work, we investigate the influence of the AGN disk photon field on neutrino emission within the internal dissipation regions of a two-component sGRB jet (a narrow core and a wide wing). We find that, due to the strong AGN disk photon field, the neutrino flux at high-energy part (e.g., PeV to EeV) will be suppressed, while the relatively lower-energy part (e.g., TeV to PeV) will be enhanced. Such a conclusion can enhance the constraints on GRB parameters (e.g., baryonic loading factor and bulk Lorentz factor) based on the future detection or non-detection of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs. Besides, the two-component jet can display two-bump structure at higher and lower energy in the neutrino spectrum.

These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder.

We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits.

It is very similar to Ref. 11 but is mathematically simpler and more self-contained. Our purpose is mainly pedagogical, to be more accessible to students and non-specialists with a knowledge of general relativity. We also call further attention to the expected explosive evaporation of small black holes, not yet observed, which would be an almost unique window into Planck scale physics.

CPS consists of a constellation of radio antennas distributed across the outer Solar System, operating on baselines of tens of astronomical units. By precisely timing the arrival of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs), CPS infers source distances via trilateration -- analogous to global navigation satellite systems such as GPS but on cosmological scales.   We show that CPS distance measurements could result in sub-percent constraints on the Hubble constant with even a handful of detections, whereas we predict that 10-100 FRB sources are likely visible. We evaluate dominant sources of uncertainty -- wavefront timing precision, interstellar refractive delays, spacecraft positional knowledge, and onboard clock stability -- finding these controllable at required levels using near-term technologies. Our nominal design employs five spacecraft with 8 m deployable antennas, 3-6 GHz receivers with sub-30 K system temperatures, and space-qualified atomic clocks similar to those on GPS satellites, supported by a ground network for ranging calibration and FRB alerts.   Beyond cosmic expansion, CPS may enable frontier measurements in astrophysics and fundamental physics, including constraints on small-scale dark matter structure, microhertz gravitational waves (bridging pulsar timing arrays and LISA), and the outer Solar System mass distribution.

They have been extensively studied, yet their progenitor and explosion mechanisms remain poorly understood. We study a large sample of SNe Ia comparing the narrow interstellar absorption features in their spectra with various photometric and spectroscopic supernova properties, as well as with environmental characteristics. We find that the sodium absorption is significantly stronger in younger, more star-forming and more centrally located SNe Ia, as expected. However, we also show that there is a strong dependence on intrinsic properties that is independent of the environment. In fact, we find strong evidence for two environmental SN Ia populations, an old and a young one, with the young population showing significantly different distributions of sodium strength when divided according to the Si II ejecta velocity, nebular velocity, extinction, E(B-V), and reddening curve, RV. Performing a clustering of the SNe Ia, we recover an old population of SNe with low extinction and normal ejecta velocity, while we confirm that the young population can be subdivided into a group of highly-extincted, high-velocity SNe Ia with much stronger blueshifted sodium absorption, and another of low-extincted, normal-velocity objects with little sodium absorption. We interpret this relation of intervening material with intrinsic properties as evidence for the young SN Ia population, occurring in young and star-forming environments, to have asymmetric radiation that interacts with nearby material, and whose observables depend thus on the viewing angle. Finally, we show that the cosmological mass-step is consistent with these populations.\n\n", "2602.09561": "2026-02-10, **Observational Constraints and Geometric Diagnostics of Barboza-Alcaniz and Logarithmic Dark Energy Parametrizations**, Archana Dixit et.al., [2602.09561v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09561v1)\n\n This study investigates and compares two prominent two-dimensional dark energy (DE) parameterizations: Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) and Logarithmic forms by comparing them with a comprehensive set of observational data comprising Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Pantheon compilation, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (DESI BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC).

Schaefer et.al., [2602.09377v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09377v1)\n\n Recurrent nova (RN) T Pyxidis (T Pyx) has a complex history of mass accreting-onto and ejection-from the white dwarf, with a classical nova eruption around 1866 kick-starting a RN-phase with six RN eruptions from 1890--2011. T Pyx is a primary progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). This is chiefly a question of whether the mass accreted by the white dwarf ($M\\_{\\rm accreted}$) is more-or-less than the mass ejected by the nova eruptions ($M\\_{\\rm ejecta}$) over the entire eruption cycle. Prior attempts to measure $M\\_{\\rm ejecta}$ from the traditional methods have a scatter of $>$130$\\times$, so only a new technique can provide a measure of adequate accuracy and reliability. This new technique is the timing experiment of measuring the orbital period from 1986 to 2025, where the period increased by $+$50.3$\\pm$7.9 parts-per-million across the 2011 eruption.

The FMKs show significant flux fluctuations, and many of those detected in 2013 are absent in the 2020 image. Proper-motion measurements derived from cross-correlation analysis indicate that most FMKs follow nearly ballistic expansion, whereas some, particularly those just beyond the eastern Fe-rich, X-ray emitting ejecta region, exhibit noticeable deceleration.

The most massive black holes grow to masses of $\\sim10^{6}$ M$\\_\\odot$ by $z=12.5$ during short bursts of super-Eddington accretion, sustained over a period of 5-30 Myr. We find that the determining factor that cuts off this initial growth is feedback from the MBH itself, rather than nearby supernovae or exhausting the available gas reservoir. Our simulations show that for the most actively accreting MBHs, feedback completely evacuates the gas from the host halo and ejects it into the inter-galactic medium. Despite implementing a relatively weak feedback model, the energy injected into the gas surrounding the MBH exceeds the binding energy of the halo. These results either indicate that MBH feedback in the early ($\u039b$CDM) Universe is much weaker than previously assumed, or that at least some of the high redshift galaxies we currently observe with JWST formed via a two-step process, whereby a MBH initially quenches its host galaxy and later reconstitutes its baryonic reservoir, either through mergers with gas rich galaxies or from accretion from the cosmic web. Moreover, the maximum black hole masses that emerge in SEEDZ are effectively set by a combination of MBH feedback modelling and the binding potential of the host halo. Unless feedback is extremely ineffective at early times (for example if growth is merger dominated rather than accretion dominated or feedback is contained close to the MBH) then the maximum mass of black holes at redshift before 12.5 should not significantly exceed $10^6$ M$\\_\\odot$.\n\n", "2602.09094": "2026-02-09, **Downsizing does not extend to dwarf galaxies: identifying the stellar mass regimes shaped by supernova and AGN feedback**, Ilin Lazar et.al., [2602.09094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09094v1)\n\n We explore how the fraction of red (quenched) galaxies varies in the dwarf galaxy regime (10^7 MSun < Mstar < 10^9.5 MSun), using a mass-complete sample of ~5900 dwarfs at z<0.15, constructed using deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field. The red fraction decreases steadily until Mstar ~ 10^8.5 MSun and then increases again towards lower stellar masses. This 'U' shape demonstrates that the traditional notion of 'downsizing' (i.e. that progressively lower mass galaxies maintain star formation until later epochs) is incorrect -- downsizing does not continue uninterrupted into the dwarf regime. The U shape persists regardless of environment, indicating that it is driven by internal processes rather than external environment-driven mechanisms. Our results suggest that, at Mstar < 10^8 MSun, the quenching of star formation is dominated by supernova (SN) feedback and becomes more effective with decreasing stellar mass, as the potential well becomes shallower. At Mstar > 10^9 MSun, the quenching is driven by a mix of SN feedback and AGN feedback (which becomes more effective with increasing stellar mass, as central black holes become more massive). The processes that quench star formation are least effective in the range 10^8 MSun < Mstar < 10^9 MSun, likely because the potential well is deep enough to weaken the impact of SN feedback, while the effect of AGN feedback is still insignificant. The cosmological simulations tested here do not match the details of how the red fraction varies as a function of stellar mass -- we propose that the red fraction vs stellar mass relation (particularly in the dwarf regime) is a powerful calibrator for the processes that regulate star formation in galaxy formation models.\n\n", "2602.09096": "2026-02-09, **A Faint Progenitor System for the Faint Supernova 2024vjm**, Erez A.

Their uniformity is credited to their single origin as thermonuclear explosions of White dwarf (WD) stars. Nevertheless, some SNe Ia break this regularity. Prominently, the Iax subclass are less energetic and remarkably diverse, raising questions about their progenitor systems. While no progenitor system of a normal SN Ia has ever been detected, a luminous blue star was identified in pre-explosion images of the site of the bright SN Iax SN 2012Z, suggested to be a helium giant companion star acting as a mass donor to a WD SN progenitor. This is in line with models of weak mass accretion of a WD from a binary companion, producing an explosion that does not fully disrupt the star. However, these models fail to explain the properties of the faintest Type Iax explosions, suggesting either they originate from other WD binary systems, or even from massive progenitor stars. Here, we present the faint SN Iax SN 2024vjm - possibly the faintest supernova observed to date. Using a deep pre-explosion image taken by the recently launched Euclid space mission, we show that its progenitor system must be fainter than the helium giant SN Iax progenitor candidate of SN 2012Z, as well as that of the luminous red companion or remnant of the faint SN 2008ha, and may require a subdwarf helium star as a mass donor. The deep image also provides strong arguments against a massive star origin for this faint supernova. Our observations argue that SN 2024vjm is a WD explosion, but we find that remarkably faint SNe Iax fade more slowly than bright ones, i.e., they evolve in an opposite manner from the famous Phillips relation that makes regular SNe Ia cosmological candles.\n\n", "2602.08928": "2026-02-09, **Hints of sign-changing scalar field energy density and a transient acceleration phase at $z\\sim 2$ from model-agnostic reconstructions**, \u00d6zg\u00fcr Akarsu et.al., [2602.08928v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08928v1)\n\n We present a data-driven reconstruction of the late-time expansion history and its implications for dark-energy dynamics.

Assuming GR at the background level, we map the reconstructed kinematics onto a dark-energy fluid and a scalar-field description, yielding the total potential and kinetic contributions that reproduce the inferred $H(z)$. To interpret the reconstruction, we consider both a minimal single-field model (canonical or phantom) and a two-field (quintom) system consisting of one canonical and one phantom scalar field (or families). Within the GR-based effective-fluid mapping, the inferred dark-energy density changes sign for all dataset combinations explored, transitioning from $\u03c1\\_{\\rm DE}<0$ at higher redshift to $\u03c1\\_{\\rm DE}>0$ toward the present, and defining a transition redshift $z\\_\\dagger$ by $\u03c1\\_{\\rm DE}(z\\_\\dagger)=0$.

These deviations are characterised by three prominent features: (i) a progressive spectral hardening above approximately 200 GeV, (ii) an excess between 10 and 30 TeV (the ``multi-TeV bump''), followed by a sharp turnover around 100 TeV, and (iii) a pronounced structure between 0.1 and 10 PeV (the ``PeV bump''). We propose a minimal two cosmic-ray population framework that consistently accounts for the observed CR proton spectrum across six decades in energy, from GeV to PeV. In this scenario, the spectral complexity arises naturally from a transition between two Galactic CR proton populations in the 10-100 TeV energy range. The low-energy population exhibits a sharp cutoff at tens of TeV, while a second, higher-energy population emerges and dominates above 100 TeV, terminating with a smooth exponential cutoff at approximately 6.5 PeV. This framework reproduces all observed spectral features without invoking contributions from nearby sources or requiring non-standard assumptions about particle acceleration or propagation. Recent gamma-ray observations of supernova remnants, star-forming regions, and microquasars provide plausible astrophysical candidates for the origin of the two CR components.\n\n"}}
