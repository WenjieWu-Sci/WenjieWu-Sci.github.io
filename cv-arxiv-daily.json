[Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 051805 (2009)]. The model contains a $CP$-violating phase in the Higgs potential which plays an important role in electroweak baryogenesis and is thus expected to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe simultaneously. However, such a $CP$-violating phase is severely constrained by the measurements of the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM), and a suppression mechanism for the eEDM is necessary to explain the observed baryon asymmetry while avoiding the constraint. In this paper, we examine neutrino mass, lepton-flavor-violating processes, dark matter, and the eEDM in the model. We show that the eEDM can be suppressed by destructive interference between the $CP$-violating phases in the Higgs sector and the dark sector with large $CP$-violating phases. We propose some benchmark scenarios including $O(1)$ $CP$-violating phases where tiny neutrino mass and dark matter can be explained while avoiding all current experimental and theoretical constraints. These $CP$-violating phases are expected to be large enough to generate the observed baryon asymmetry in the electroweak baryogenesis scenario.\n\n", "2403.13494": "2024-03-20, **Novel imprint of a dark photon from the 3-3-1-1 model**, Doan Minh Luong et.al., [2403.13494v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13494v1)\n\n We investigate a dark photon that arises from the UV model based upon $SU(3)\\_C\\otimes SU(3)\\_L\\otimes U(1)\\_X \\otimes U(1)\\_G$ (3-3-1-1) gauge symmetry, where the last three factors enlarge the electroweak symmetry encompassing electric charge $Q=T\\_3 - 1/ \\sqrt{3}T\\_8 +X$ and dark charge $D = -2/\\sqrt{3} T\\_8 +G$.

While this may be a sign of new physics that slows the growth of structure at late times, strong astrophysical feedback processes could also be responsible. In this work, we argue that astrophysical processes are not independent of cosmology and that their coupling naturally leads to stronger baryonic feedback in cosmological models with suppressed structure formation or when combined with a mechanism that removes dark matter from halos. We illustrate this with two well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model known to suppress structure formation: massive neutrinos and decaying dark matter. Our results, based on the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, show that the combined effect of baryonic and non-baryonic suppression mechanisms is greater than the sum of its parts, particularly for decaying dark matter.

Cavity-based axion haloscopes represent the most sensitive tools for probing their theoretically favored couplings to photons in the microelectronvolt range. However, as the search mass (or frequency) increases, the detection efficiency decreases, largely due to a decrease in cavity volume. Despite the potential of higher-order resonant modes to preserve experimental volume, their practical application in searches has been limited by the challenge of maintaining a high form factor over a reasonably wide search bandwidth. We introduce an innovative tuning method that uses the unique properties of auxetic materials, designed to effectively tune higher modes. This approach was applied to the TM\\_020 mode for a dark matter axion search exploring a mass range from 21.38 to 21.79 ueV, resulting in the establishment of new exclusion limits for axion-photon coupling greater than approximately 10^-13 GeV^-1.

Constraining the halo shapes at large galactocentric distances is challenging due to the low density of luminous tracers. The well-studied early-type galaxy NGC 5128 (Centaurus A - CenA), has a large number of radial velocities for globular clusters (GCs) and planetary nebulae (PNe) of its extended stellar halo. In this work, we aim to determine the deviation from spherical symmetry of the dark matter halo of CenA at 5 $R\\_{\\rm e}$ using its GCs as kinematic tracers. We used the largest photometric catalogue of GC candidates to accurately characterise the spatial distribution of the relaxed population and investigated the presence of non-relaxed structures in the kinematic catalogue of GCs using the relaxed point-symmetric velocity field as determined by the host's PNe population. We used anisotropic Jeans modelling under axisymmetric assumptions together with the Gaussian likelihood and GCs as discrete tracers. The gravitational potential is generated by flattened stellar and dark matter distributions. We leveraged different orbital properties of the blue and red GCs to model them separately. We find that discrete kinematics of the GCs are consistent with being drawn from an underlying relaxed velocity field determined from PNe.

Identifying key differences between the properties of barred and unbarred galaxies can uncover clues about the conditions for triggering bar formation. We explore the early stages of bar formation in a small sample of disc barred galaxies extracted from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and compare their properties to those of unbarred galaxies. According to our results, the most important difference between barred and unbarred galaxies is that the former have systematically higher fractions of stellar to dark matter mass in their inner regions, from very early stages and prior to the formation of the bars. They harbour high initial gas content, fostering increased star formation rates and leading to a central mass concentration that grows faster over time compared to unbarred galaxies. Examining the evolution of the halo spin within 10 ckpc reveals that barred galaxies have higher angular momentum transfer from the disc to the halo. Curiously, both barred and unbarred galaxies share similar initial low values of the halo spin, consistent with those proposed in the literature for bar formation. Furthermore, we evaluate existing stability criteria to capture the complexity of the process, and investigate the effects of mergers, flybys, and environment as possible drivers of bar formation.

Fermion-boson stars have been extensively studied in the static non-rotating case, exploring their combined stability and their gravitational radiation in binary mergers.

Therefore, the study of rotating fermion-boson stars has important implications for astrophysics, as they could provide a new avenue for the detection of gravitational waves. In addition, these objects may shed light on the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in the cores of neutron stars, and explain any tension in the determination of the dense-matter equation of state from multi-messenger observations.

Here, the universe is taken to be an open thermodynamical model where the particle is created irreversibly and consequently, the creation pressure comes into the energy-momentum tensor of the material content. The rate at which the particle created is assumed to have a linear relation with the Hubble parameter and the created particle is dark matter (pressureless). The Umami Chaplygin gas is considered dark energy, pressureless dust is taken as dark matter and a phenomenological interaction term is taken for mathematical simplicity. Dynamical analysis is performed to obtain an overall evolution of the model we consider. The autonomous system is obtained by considering dimensionless variables in terms of cosmological variables. The local stability of the critical points and the classical stability of the model are also performed at each critical point. This study explores some cosmologically viable scenarios when we constrain the model parameters. Some critical points exhibit the accelerated de Sitter expansion of the universe at both the early phase as well as the late phase of evolution which is characterized by completely Umami Chaplygin fluid equation of state. Scaling solutions are also described by some other critical points showing late-time accelerated attractors in phase space satisfying present observational data, and solving the coincidence problem.

(2023) claimed detection of two $\\gamma$-ray sources (Src-NE and Src-NW) associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) G298.6$-$0.0, and interpreted it as an old GeV SNR interacting with molecular clouds (MCs). In this follow-up study, we refine the flux measurements below 2~GeV with Fermi-LAT event types of better angular reconstruction. Then, we report our cosmic-ray phenomenology in a hadronic scenario, considering both the shell and MC regions of SNR G298.6$-$0.0.

The cosmic-ray population for Src-NW starts at a higher energy such that the $E\\_\\mathrm{CR,min}$ ratio of Src-NW to Src-NE is $\\gtrsim$2. The high $E\\_\\mathrm{CR,min}$, as well as the high cosmic-ray energy density required ($\\sim$26~eV~cm$^{-3}$), supports the interpretation that Src-NW is predominantly the $\\gamma$-ray emission from the farther MCs being bombarded by protons that had earlier escaped from SNR G298.6$-$0.0. By comparing the high-energy features of G298.6$-$0.0 with those of analogical SNRs, especially SNR W28 and SNR W44, we further constrain the age of SNR G298.6$-$0.0 to be 10--30~kyr.\n\n", "2403.13641": "2024-03-20, **Sculpting the Morphology of Supernova Remnant Pa 30 via Efficient Ejecta Cooling**, Paul C. Duffell et.al., [2403.13641v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13641v1)\n\n We demonstrate in a proof-of-concept numerical hydrodynamics calculation that the narrow radial filamentary structures seen in Pa 30 could be generated through highly efficient cooling (e.g. via line emission) in the ejecta. Efficient cooling in the ejecta causes a drop of pressure support in Rayleigh-Taylor fingers, leading them to be compressed, and suppressing the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Following this result, we make three predictions that could determine whether this is the mechanism responsible for shaping Pa 30: First, we predict very strong emission lines, strong enough to cool a significant fraction of the shock energy in an expansion time. Secondly, we predict that the forward shock should be highly corrugated on small scales, with the shock front closely following the structure of the filaments. Third, we predict that these filaments should be nearly ballistic, with velocities around 90% of the free-expansion velocity ($v \\approx 0.9 ~r/t$). These predictions should be falsifiable in follow-up observations of this remnant.\n\n", "2403.13305": "2024-03-20, **Shock and Cosmic Ray Chemistry Associated with the Supernova Remnant W28**, Tian-Yu Tu et.al., [2403.13305v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13305v1)\n\n Supernova remnants (SNRs) exert strong influence on the physics and chemistry of the nearby molecular clouds (MCs) through shock waves and the cosmic rays (CRs) they accelerate. To investigate the SNR-cloud interaction in the prototype interacting SNR W28 (G6.4$-$0.1), we present new observations of $\\rm HCO^+$, HCN and HNC $J=1\\text{--}0$ lines, supplemented by archival data of CO isotopes, $\\rm N\\_2H^+$ and $\\rm H^{13}CO^+$. We compare the spatial distribution and spectral line profiles of different molecular species. Using local thermodynatic equilibrium (LTE) assumption, we obtain an abundance ratio $N({\\rm HCO^+})/N({\\rm CO})\\sim10^{-4}$ in the northeastern shocked cloud, which is higher by an order of magnitude than the values in unshocked clouds. This can be accounted for by the chemistry jointly induced by shock and CRs, with the physical parameters previously obtained from observations: preshock density $n\\_{\\rm H}\\sim 2\\times 10^{5}\\rm \\ cm^{-3}$, CR ionization rate $\\zeta=2.5\\times 10^{-15} \\rm \\ s^{-1}$ and shock velocity $V\\_{\\rm s}=15\\text{--}20\\rm \\ km\\ s^{-1}$.

Previous studies typically use the currently-observed status of the host galaxy. However, given the delay time between the birth of the progenitor star and the SN Ia explosion, the currently-observed status may differ from the birth environments of the SN Ia progenitor star. In this paper, employing the chemical evolution and accurately determined stellar population properties of 44 early-type host galaxies, we, for the first time, estimate the SN Ia progenitor star birth environment, specifically $[Fe/H]\\_{Birth}$ and $[\\alpha/Fe]\\_{Birth}$. We show that $[\\alpha/Fe]\\_{Birth}$ has a $30.4^{+10.6}\\_{-10.1}\\%$ wider range than $[\\alpha/Fe]\\_{Current}$, while the range of $[Fe/H]\\_{Birth}$ is not statistically different ($17.9^{+26.0}\\_{-27.1}\\%$) to that of $[Fe/H]\\_{Current}$. The birth and current environments of [Fe/H] and [$\\alpha$/Fe] are sample from different populations (p-values of the KS test < 0.01). We find that light-curve fit parameters are insensitive to $[Fe/H]\\_{Birth}$ ($<0.9\\sigma$ for the non-zero slope), while a linear trend is observed with HRs at the 2.4$\\sigma$ significance level. With $[\\alpha/Fe]\\_{Birth}$, no linear trends ($<1.1\\sigma$) are observed. Interestingly, we find that $[\\alpha/Fe]\\_{Birth}$ clearly splits the SN Ia sample into two groups: SN Ia exploded in $[\\alpha/Fe]\\_{Birth}$-rich or $[\\alpha/Fe]\\_{Birth}$-poor environments. SNe Ia exploded in different $[\\alpha/Fe]\\_{Birth}$ groups have different weighted-means of light-curve shape parameters: $0.81\\pm0.33$ ($2.5\\sigma$). They are thought to be drawn from different populations (p-value = 0.01). Regarding SN Ia colour and HRs, there is no difference in the weighted-means ($<1.0\\sigma$) and distributions (p-value > 0.27) of each $[\\alpha/Fe]\\_{Birth}$ group.\n\n", "2403.12942": "2024-03-19, **The physics of Core-Collapse Supernovae: explosion mechanism and explosive nucleosynthesis**, Luca Boccioli et.al., [2403.12942v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12942v1)\n\n Recent developments in multi-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae have considerably improved our understanding of this complex phenomenon. In addition to that, one-dimensional (1D) studies have been employed to study the explosion mechanism and its causal connection to the pre-collapse structure of the star, as well as to explore the vast parameter space of supernovae. Nonetheless, many uncertainties still affect the late stages of the evolution of massive stars, their collapse, and the subsequent shock propagation. In this review, we will briefly summarize the state-of-the-art of both 1D and 3D simulations and how they can be employed to study the evolution of massive stars, supernova explosions, and shock propagation, focusing on the uncertainties that affect each of these phases. Finally, we will illustrate the typical nucleosynthesis products that emerge from the explosion.\n\n", "2403.12932": "2024-03-19, **Revisiting the abundance pattern and charge-exchange emission in the M82 centre**, K. Fukushima et.al., [2403.12932v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12932v1)\n\n The interstellar medium (ISM) in starburst galaxies contains plenty of chemical elements synthesised by core-collapse supernova explosions. By measuring the abundances of these metals, we can study the chemical enrichment within galaxies and the transportation of metals into circumgalactic environments through powerful outflows. We perform the spectral analysis of the X-ray emissions from the M82 core using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) onboard XMM-Newton to accurately estimate the metal abundances in the ISM. We analyse over 300 ks of RGS data observed with fourteen position angles, covering an 80 arcsec cross-dispersion width. We employ multi-temperature thermal plasma components in collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE) to reproduce the observed spectra, each exhibiting different spatial broadenings. The O vii band CCD image shows a broader distribution compared to those for O viii and Fe-L bands. The O viii line profiles have a prominent double-peaked structure, corresponding to the northward and southward outflows. The O vii triplet feature exhibits marginal peaks, and a single CIE component, convolved with the O vii band image, approximately reproduces the spectral shape. Combining a CIE model with a charge-exchange emission model also successfully reproduces the O vii line profiles. However, the ratio of these two components varies significantly with the observed position angles, which is physically implausible. Spectral fitting of the broadband spectra suggests a multi-temperature phase in the ISM, approximated by three components at 0.1, 0.4, and 0.7 keV. Notably, the 0.1 keV component exhibits a broader distribution than the 0.4 and 0.7 keV plasmas. The derived abundance pattern shows super-solar N/O, solar Ne/O and Mg/O, and half-solar Fe/O ratios. These results indicate the chemical enrichments by core-collapse supernovae in starburst galaxies.\n\n"}}
