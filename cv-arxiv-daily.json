Another neutrino source that has received far less attention is binary neutron star mergers. Including the data from recent simulations, we find that detection in current and near-future neutrino experiments is not feasible, and a megaton-scale detector with $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV threshold, such as the proposed Deep-TITAND, MEMPHYS, or MICA, will be required. This is due to the updated binary neutron star merger rate and the time-of-flight delay caused by the nonzero neutrino mass. Regarding the former, recent results from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has significantly lowered the upper limit on the neutron star merger rate. As for the latter, neutrino events from neutron star mergers are expected to be recorded shortly after the gravitational wave signal. Limiting the analysis to such short time windows can significantly reduce background rates. While this approach has been qualitatively discussed in the literature, the effect of the time delay caused by neutrino mass, which can substantially extend the observation windows, has been disregarded. We present a refined analysis employing energy-dependent time windows and luminosity distance cuts for the mergers and provide realistic estimates of the detector runtime required to record neutrinos from binary neutron star mergers with small background contamination. The relative timing between the neutrino and gravitational wave signals can also be employed to probe the scale of neutrino mass. We find that the sensitivity to the lightest neutrino mass exceeds both the most stringent terrestrial bounds from KATRIN and the projections based on galactic supernovae. This level of sensitivity may become particularly relevant in the future if terrestrial and supernova constraints are not significantly improved.\n\n", "2511.16631": "2025-11-20, **A Core-Collapse Supernova Neutrino Parameterization with Enhanced Physical Interpretability**, Haihao Shi et.al., [2511.16631v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16631v1)\n\n We introduce a novel parameterization of supernova neutrino energy spectra with a clear physical motivation. Its central parameter, $\u03c4(t)$, quantifies the characteristic thermal-diffusion area during the explosion. When applied to the historic SN1987A data, this parameterization yields statistically significant fits and provides robust constraints on the unobserved low-energy portion of the spectrum. Beyond this specific application, we demonstrate the model's power on a suite of 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, finding that the temporal evolution of $\u03c4(t)$ distinctly separates successful from failed explosions. Furthermore, we constrain the progenitor mass of SN 1987A to approximately 19 solar masses by applying Smoothed Isotonic Regression, while noting the sensitivity of this estimate to observational uncertainties. Moreover, in these simulations, $\u03c4(t)$ and the gravitational-wave strain amplitude display a strong, synergistic co-evolution, directly linking the engine's energetic evolution to its geometric asymmetry. This implies that the thermodynamic state of the explosion is imprinted not only on the escaping neutrino flux, but also recorded in the shape of the energy spectrum. Our framework therefore offers a valuable tool for decoding the detailed core dynamics and multi-messenger processes of future galactic supernovae.\n\n", "2511.16614": "2025-11-20, **Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Neutrino Reconstruction of Single-line Events in the ANTARES Telescope**, A. Albert et.al., [2511.16614v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16614v1)\n\n We present the $N$-fit algorithm designed to improve the reconstruction of neutrino events detected by a single line of the ANTARES underwater telescope, usually associated with low energy neutrino events ($\\sim$ 100 GeV). $N$-Fit is a neural network model that relies on deep learning and combines several advanced techniques in machine learning --deep convolutional layers, mixture density output layers, and transfer learning. This framework divides the reconstruction process into two dedicated branches for each neutrino event topology --tracks and showers-- composed of sub-models for spatial estimation --direction and position-- and energy inference, which later on are combined for event classification. Regarding the direction of single-line events, the $N$-Fit algorithm significantly refines the estimation of the zenithal angle, and delivers reliable azimuthal angle predictions that were previously unattainable with traditional $\u03c7^2$-fit methods. Improving on energy estimation of single-line events is a tall order; $N$-Fit benefits from transfer learning to efficiently integrate key characteristics, such as the estimation of the closest distance from the event to the detector. $N$-Fit also takes advantage from transfer learning in event topology classification by freezing convolutional layers of the pretrained branches. Tests on Monte Carlo simulations and data demonstrate a significant reduction in mean and median absolute errors across all reconstructed parameters. The improvements achieved by $N$-Fit highlight its potential for advancing multimessenger astrophysics and enhancing our ability to probe fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model using single-line events from ANTARES data.\n\n", "2511.16506": "2025-11-20, **Two-beam Multiparticle Many-body simulations of Inhomogeneous FFI**, Zoha Laraib et.al., [2511.16506v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16506v1)\n\n Neutrino flavor evolution in dense astrophysical environments is inherently nonlinear and sensitive to many-body (MB) quantum effects beyond the mean-field (MF) approximation. Existing MB studies are constrained by small system sizes, closed boundaries, and highly idealized symmetry assumptions. We present a unified tensor-network framework that enables simulations of inhomogeneous and anisotropic flavor evolution under conditions relevant to core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers. Within this framework, we examine the effects of inhomogeneity, boundary conditions, and convergence with resolution for multiple neutrino distributions, allowing direct comparison of these setups under one consistent formulation. In our simulations, many-body systems equilibrate earlier than their mean-field counterparts while approaching similar final flavor states. Enlarging the interaction region allows open boundaries to reproduce closed-system behavior, but only when the beams begin superimposed and interact continuously. By contrast, initially separated configurations develop entanglement more slowly, interact over longer times, and equilibrate to a flavor content that differs from that obtained from initially superimposed calculations.\n\n", "2511.16408": "2025-11-20, **Development & Characterization of Electrodes for large-scale Xenon Time Projection Chambers**, A.

We take new data of JUNO and perform numerical scans to explore the flavor space compatible with data in SO(10) GUTs. The quark-lepton correlation shows the preference of normal ordering for light neutrino masses, predicts favored region of the CP-violating phase in neutrino oscillations, and classifies GUT models based their testability in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. The quark-lepton correlation predicts mass spectrum of right-handed neutrinos, pointing to the energy scale of baryon and lepton number violation and providing sources for baryogenesis.

Working with a two-flavor system, both mass orderings are examined, and the calculation incorporates the interference between distinct trajectories reaching the detector.

Therefore, an independent probe for these kinds of DE-DM interactions would be appealing from observational aspects. In this paper, we propose the black hole superradiance as a novel astrophysical probe for field-theoretic interacting DE-DM models, providing complementary constraints independent of large-scale cosmological observations. The core principle is that the DE-DM interaction can alter the effective mass of the superradiant ultralight boson, thereby modifying its superradiant instability rate around spinning black holes. We explore this connection through two distinct scenarios: a model where the DE field mediates a dark fifth force within the DM sector, affecting the superradiance from DM particles; and a novel mechanism where the DE field itself becomes superradiant due to the effective mass enhancement induced by dense DM spikes around supermassive black holes. By applying a statistical framework to black hole observations in both scenarios, we derive constraints on the fundamental DE-DM coupling strength. Although the current constraints are rather loose due to small samples and inaccurate measurements, our work provides new astrophysical constraints on these interacting DE-DM scenarios and establishes a new synergy between black hole physics and cosmology for probing the fundamental nature of the dark sector.\n\n", "2511.16130": "2025-11-20, **Creation of Viscous Dark Energy by the Hubble Flow: Comparison with SNe Ia Master Sample Binned Data**, Iolanda Navonea et.al., [2511.16130v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16130v1)\n\n We study a cosmological model featuring evolutionary dark energy, according to the idea that the creation of its constituents arises from the gravitational field of the expanding universe, whose non-equilibrium physics is described by a non-zero bulk viscosity coefficient. This physical scenario calls for two additional parameters with respect to the \u039bCDM model, one of which is the equation of state parameter of the created dark energy. The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the \u039bCDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the \u039bCDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character.

We determine $Z\\_{ICM}$ via spectral fitting across multiple annuli finding a best fit of $Z\\_{ICM} = -0.08^{+0.07}\\_{-0.07}\\, log\\left(\\frac{M\\_*}{M\\_{gas}}\\right) + 0.30^{+0.06}\\_{-0.06}$ with intrinsic scatter $\u03c3\\_p = 0.09^{+0.02}\\_{-0.01}$. We use closed-box chemical evolution models to estimate the metallicity yield from observable stellar populations, incorporating updated supernova yields and corrections for metals locked in remnants, $Z\\_* = (1.14 \\pm 0.52) \\, log\\left(1 + \\frac{M\\_*}{M\\_{gas}}\\right)$. Our results demonstrate that present-day stellar populations systematically underpredict $Z\\_{ICM}$, with an inferred excess component increasing in systems with low $M\\_*/M\\_{gas}$. This trend supports the need for an early enrichment population (EEP) distinct from visible stars, $Z\\_{EEP}$. We find this necessity holds when reconsidering the closed-box assumption by removing all galaxy groups, potential leaky systems, deriving $Z\\_{EEP}$ within $1\u03c3$ when including and excluding groups. Three systems (NGC1132, NGC5098, and NGC4325) deviate from the survey trend, exhibiting steep negative radial metallicity gradients and unusually low $Z\\_{ICM}$. We posit these systems to be late-forming whose ICM enrichment reflects only recent stellar populations. Our analysis quantifies the necessity of an EEP and provides trends for testing cluster chemical evolution models.\n\n", "2511.16130": "2025-11-20, **Creation of Viscous Dark Energy by the Hubble Flow: Comparison with SNe Ia Master Sample Binned Data**, Iolanda Navonea et.al., [2511.16130v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16130v1)\n\n We study a cosmological model featuring evolutionary dark energy, according to the idea that the creation of its constituents arises from the gravitational field of the expanding universe, whose non-equilibrium physics is described by a non-zero bulk viscosity coefficient. This physical scenario calls for two additional parameters with respect to the \u039bCDM model, one of which is the equation of state parameter of the created dark energy. The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the \u039bCDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the \u039bCDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.\n\n", "2511.15993": "2025-11-20, **Formation of Extremely Low-Mass White Dwarfs in Wide Orbits**, Yangyang Zhang et.al., [2511.15993v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15993v1)\n\n Helium white dwarfs (WDs) with masses less than 0.3 $\\rm M\\_{\\sun}$ are known as extremely low-mass WDs (ELM WDs), which cannot be produced by single stellar evolution in theory. Generally, these stars are believed to form through binary interactions. Recently, two ELM WDs in unusually wide orbits were reported, i.e., KIC 8145411 and HE 0430-2457. Their orbital separations are too wide to be produced by the binary evolution scenario. In this work, we study the formation of wide-orbit ELM WD binaries from hierarchical triple systems. In this scenario, an ELM WD is formed from the inner binary and subsequently forms a wide binary system with the third object. We find that the merger of an evolved star with a brown dwarf in the inner binary fails to produce single ELM WDs, but Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) explosions can successfully do so. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the supernova explosion on the orbital distribution of the surviving binary and find that this channel may have a probability of reproducing the orbital parameters of HE 0430-2457, but fails to reproduce the observed features of KIC 8145411. This supports recent observational recalibrations suggesting that KIC 8145411 resides in a triple system rather than a binary.\n\n", "2511.15975": "2025-11-20, **SN 2019vxm: A Shocking Coincidence between Fermi and TESS**, Zachary G. Lane et.al., [2511.15975v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15975v1)\n\n Shock breakout and, in some cases, jet-driven high-energy emission are increasingly recognized as key signatures of the earliest phases of core-collapse supernovae, especially in Type IIn systems due to their dense, interaction-dominated circumstellar environments. We present a comprehensive photometric analysis of SN 2019vxm, a long-duration, luminous Type IIn supernova, $M\\_V^{}=-21.41\\pm0.05\\;{\\rm mag}$, observed from X-ray to near-infrared. SN 2019vxm is the first superluminous supernovae Type IIn to be caught with well-sampled TESS photometric data on the rise and has a convincing coincident X-ray source at the time of first light. The high-cadence TESS light curve captures the early-time rise, which is well described by a broken power law with an index of $n=1.41\\pm0.04$, significantly shallower than the canonical $n=2$ behavior. From this, we constrain the time of first light to within 7.2 hours. We identify a spatial and temporal coincidence between SN 2019vxm and the X-ray transient GRB191117A, corresponding to a $3.3\u03c3$ association confidence. Both the short-duration X-ray event and the lightcurve modeling are consistent with shock breakout into a dense, asymmetric circumstellar medium, indicative of a massive, compact progenitor such as a luminous blue variable transitioning to Wolf-Rayet phase embedded in a clumpy, asymmetric environment.\n\n"}}
