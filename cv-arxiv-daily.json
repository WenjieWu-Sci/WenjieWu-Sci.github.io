Time-resolved spectral analysis of the prompt $\\gamma$-ray emission was conducted utilizing the Bayesian block method to determine statistically optimal time bins. Based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the data generally favor the Band+Blackbody (short as BB) model. We speculate that the main Band component comes from the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, while the additional BB component comes from the neutrino annihilation process. The BB component becomes significant for a low-spin, high-accretion rate black hole central engine, as evidenced by our model comparison with the data. The afterglow light curve exhibits typical power-law decay, and its behavior can be explained by the collision between the ejecta and constant interstellar medium (ISM).

These observations, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, support a dynamically evolving dark energy at a high confidence level. When using cosmological observations to weigh neutrinos, the results of weighing neutrinos will be significantly affected by the measurement of dark energy due to the degeneracy between neutrino mass and the dark-energy equation of state. Therefore, we need to understand how the dynamical evolution of dark energy in the current situation will affect the measurement of neutrino mass. In this work, we utilize these latest observations and other additional distance measurements to discuss the mutual influence between neutrinos and dark energy, then calculate the Bayes factor to compare models. We consider three neutrino mass hierarchies including degenerate hierarchy (DH), normal hierarchy (NH), and inverted hierarchy (IH), as well as three dark energy models including $\\Lambda \\rm CDM$, $w\\rm CDM$, and $w\\_0w\\_a \\rm CDM$ models. Cosmological data combined with the prior of particle physics experiments can provide strong to decisive evidence favoring the $w\\_0w\\_a {\\rm CDM}+\\sum m\\_\\nu$ model with NH.

Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results.

Using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems, complemented by numerical solutions of the evolution equations, we study the late-time behavior of our model. We show that contrary to the uncoupled scenario, the coupled phantom model admits accelerated scaling solutions. However, they do not correspond to a final state of the universe's evolution and, therefore, cannot be used to solve the cosmological coincidence problem. Furthermore, we show that, for certain coupling parameter values, the total equation-of-state parameter's asymptotic behavior is significantly changed when compared to the uncoupled scenario, allowing for solutions less phantom even for steeper potentials of the phantom scalar field.\n\n", "2407.15529": "2024-07-22, **Environmental effects on Low Surface Brightness Galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulation**, Luis Enrique P\u00e9rez-Monta\u00f1o et.al., [2407.15529v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15529v1)\n\n Employing the TNG100 run of the IllustrisTNG project, we characterize the environment of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (LSBGs) across varying scales, from their associated dark matter halos to their distribution within the broader cosmic structure. We find no significant differences in the halo concentration index $c\\_{200}$ between LSBGs and their High Surface Brightness (HSBGs) counterparts, with LSBGs residing in halos with higher spin parameter $\\lambda$ and slightly more spherical shapes than HSBGs. LSBGs show a stronger alignment between the dark and stellar angular momentum vectors than their high surface brightness counterparts. The relative abundance of LSBGs within groups and clusters displays a central deficit, hinting at potential destruction upon reaching these core regions. Studying the density field, we find a preference for rotation-dominated LSBGs to reside in low-density environments, while dispersion-dominated LSBGs thrive in high-density regions where galaxy interactions govern their evolution, an observation corroborated by our analysis of the two-point correlation function $\\xi (r)$. Our examination of the cosmic web reveals no significant differences in the distance to the closest large-scale structure, barring a few exceptions. This suggests a limited impact of large-scale spatial distribution on mechanisms driving LSBG evolution. All together, we conclude that the halo vicinity and local environment at the scale of galaxy clusters, where mechanisms such as galaxy mergers and tidal stripping, as well as stellar and gas accretion take place, is the most likely environment that favour the emergence of LSBGs with different morphologies, mostly driven by the presence or absence of important local interaction phenomena.\n\n", "2407.15445": "2024-07-22, **Primordial black holes in SB SUSY Gauss-Bonnet inflation**, A.

The coupling function amplifies the curvature perturbations, consequently leading to the formation of PBHs and the production of detectable secondary gravitational waves (GWs).

Axions, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem, emerge as compelling candidates for both dark matter and dark energy components of the universe. String theory, offering a unified perspective on fundamental forces, predicts a rich spectrum of axion-like particles (ALPs) arising from its compactification schemes.

We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the equation of state, and confirm that crossing of the phantom divide is required by the DESI BAO data. We then explore the theory space of Horndeski gravity employing a reconstruction method based on the effective field theory of dark energy, and show that for most of the models it is still difficult to safely cross the divide.

The earliest detection of this SN can be traced back to a few hours after the explosion. Within the first few days the light curve shows a bump feature, while the B - V color is blue and remains nearly constant. The overall spectral evolution is similar to that of an SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like SN Ia, while the C II $\\lambda6580$ absorption line appears to be unusually strong in the first spectrum taken at $t \\approx -$15.4 days after the maximum light. This carbon feature disappears quickly in subsequent evolution but it reappears at around the time of peak brightness. The complex evolution of the carbon line and the possible detection of Ni III absorption around 4700 {\\AA} and 5300 {\\AA} in the earliest spectra indicate macroscopic mixing of fuel and ash. The strong carbon lines is likely related to collision of SN ejecta with unbound carbon, consistent with the predictions of pulsational delayed-detonation or carbon-rich circumstellar-matter interaction models.

It is demonstrated that the Fermi mechanism is a crude approximation of the ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) mechanism. While both mechanisms yield similar expressions for the energy gain of a particle after encountering a shock once, leading to similar power-law distributions of the cosmic ray energy spectrum, the Fermi mechanism is found to be inconsistent with fundamental equations of electrodynamics.   It is shown that the spectral index of cosmic rays is determined by the average magnetic field compression rather than the density compression, as in the Fermi model. It is shown that the knee observed in the spectrum at an energy of 5x10^{15} eV could correspond to ions with a gyroradius comparable to the size of shocks in supernova remnants. The BSA mechanism can accurately reproduce the observed spectral index s = -2.5 below the knee energy, as well as a steeper spectrum, s = -3, above the knee. The acceleration time up to the knee, as implied by BSA, is on the order of 300 years.   First-order Fermi acceleration does not represent a physically valid mechanism and should be replaced by ballistic surfing acceleration in applications or models related to quasi-perpendicular shocks in space.

But while this new generation of X-ray telescopes have much finer spectral resolutions than their predecessors (e.g. XMM-Newton, Chandra), they also have coarser spatial resolutions, leading to problematic cross-pixel contamination. This issue is currently a critical limitation for the study of extended sources such as galaxy clusters of supernova remnants. To increase the scientific output of XRISM's hyperspectral data, we propose to fuse it with XMM-Newton data, and seek to obtain a cube with the best spatial and spectral resolution of both generations. This is the aim of hyperspectral fusion. In this article, we have implemented an algorithm that jointly deconvolves the spatial response of XRISM and the spectral response of XMM-Newton. To do so, we construct a forward model adapted for instrumental systematic degradations and Poisson noise, then tackle hyperspectral fusion as a regularized inverse problem. We test three methods of regularization: low rank approximation with Sobolev regularization; low rank approximation with 2D wavelet sparsity ; and 2D-1D wavelet sparsity. We test our method on toy models constructed from hydrodynamic simulations of supernova remnants. We find that our method reconstructs the ground truth well even when the toy model is complex. For the regularization term, we find that while the low rank approximation worked well as a spectral denoiser in models with less spectral variability, it introduced a bias in models with more spectral variability, in which case the 2D-1D wavelet sparsity regularization worked best.

Among those, the merging of independent convective regions is a poorly understood phenomenon predicted by some 1D models but whose occurrence and impact in real stars remain very uncertain. Being an intrinsically multi-D phenomenon, it is challenging to predict the exact behaviour of shell mergers with 1D models. In this work, we conduct a detailed investigation of a multiple shell merging event in a 20 M$\\_\\odot$ star using 3D hydrodynamic simulations. Making use of the active tracers for composition and the nuclear network included in the 3D model, we study the merging not only from a dynamical standpoint but also considering its nucleosynthesis and energy generation. Our simulations confirm the occurrence of the merging also in 3D, but reveal significant differences from the 1D case. Specifically, we identify entrainment and the erosion of stable regions as the main mechanisms that drive the merging, we predict much faster convective velocities compared to the mixing-length-theory velocities, and observe multiple burning phases within the same merged shell, with important effects for the chemical composition of the star, which presents a strongly asymmetric (dipolar) distribution. We expect that these differences will have important effects on the final structure of massive stars and thus their final collapse dynamics and possible supernova explosion, subsequently affecting the resulting nucleosynthesis and remnant.\n\n"}}
