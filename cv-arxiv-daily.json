All major imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) - FACT, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS - operate an active follow-up program of target-of-opportunity observations of neutrino alerts issued by IceCube. These programs use several complementary neutrino alert streams. A publicly distributed alert stream is formed by individual high-energy neutrino candidate events of potentially astrophysical origin, such as IceCube-170922A (which could be linked to the flaring blazar TXS\\,0506+056). A privately distributed alert stream is formed by clusters of neutrino events in time and space around either pre-selected gamma-ray sources or anywhere in the sky. Here, we present joint searches for multi-wavelength emission associated with a set of IceCube alerts, both private and public, received through mid-January 2021.

The fact that they are massive particles proves that the Standard Model is an incomplete theory and needs to be extended. This thesis focuses on the study of neutrino properties from the available data from laboratory experiments and cosmological observations. It also presents sensitivity studies for future neutrino experiments. The first part covers the status of the determination of the oscillation parameters in the three-neutrino framework, the mass ordering and the absolute mass scale. A second part is devoted to other neutrino properties predicted in neutrino mass models. The topics covered include the study of spin-flavour precession in solar neutrinos from non-zero neutrino magnetic moments, the prospects for neutrino non-standard interactions with quarks from the solar sector and the expected limits on CPT violation from a separate analysis of neutrino and antineutrino data. Regarding cosmology, the impact of non-standard interactions with electrons and a non-unitary three-neutrino mixing matrix in the process of neutrino decoupling are addressed. Finally, a third part explores possible connections between dark matter and neutrinos. The existence of dark matter has been proven indirectly via its gravitational effects.

Here, we consider a model where the PQ symmetry solves the strong CP problem, generates radiatively Dirac neutrino masses, and gives origin to multicomponent dark sector. Specifically, scotogenic Dirac neutrino masses arise at one-loop level. The lightest fermionic mediator acts as the second DM candidate due to a residual $Z\\_2$ symmetry resulting from the PQ symmetry breaking. The WIMP DM component resembles the well-known singlet-doublet fermion DM. While the lower WIMP dark mass region is usually excluded, our model reopens that portion of the parameter space (for DM masses below $\\lesssim 100$ GeV). Therefore, we perform a phenomenological analysis that addresses the constraints from direct searches of DM, neutrino oscillation data, and charged lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes.

Our sample includes all known Northern TeV-emitting blazars as well as blazars positionally coincident with IceCube neutrino alerts. Polarization can give additional insight into the source properties, as the polarized emission is often found to vary on different timescales and amplitudes than the total intensity emission. Here, we present an overview of the polarization properties of the TeV-emitting TELAMON sources at four frequencies in the 20 mm and 7 mm bands. While at 7 mm roughly $82\\,\\%$ of all observed sources are found to be significantly polarized, for 20 mm the percentage is $\\sim58\\,\\%$.

However, the signals from these systems will last much longer than those in current detectors, and overlap in both time and frequency, leading to increased computational cost to search for them with standard matched filtering analyses, and a higher probability that they are observed in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. We therefore present a method to search for gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals in next-generation detectors that is computationally efficient and robust against gaps in data collection and noise non-stationarities. Our method, based on the Hough Transform, finds tracks in the time/frequency plane of the detector that uniquely describe specific inspiraling systems. We find that we could detect $\\sim 5$ overlapping, intermediate-strength signals without a sensitivity loss. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can enable multi-messenger astronomy: using only low frequencies ($2-20$ Hz), we could warn astronomers $\\sim 2.5$ hours before a GW170817-like merger at 40 Mpc and provide a sky localization of $\\sim 20$ deg$^2$ using only one interferometer.

Characteristics of BDM disintegration events are able to be analyzed with a similar technique as for hadroproproduction data on colliders. The HE event that was detected in the stratosphere in 1975 differs from the collision of nuclei. The signatures of such events are the following: 1) the circle distribution of heavy secondary hadrons with almost nothing inside the ring and 2) the presence of heavy secondary particles with a mass out of range of known hadrons. The circle signature can have the BDM particles that disintegrate for a few lower-mass BDMs in the atmosphere. The same signatures should be seen at super-heavy BDM collapses on the Earth. The traces of such events are seen as pits or shafts in the ground rock, which are organized in the circles. There are at least two pieces of evidence of such holes: cenotes on the Yucatan peninsula (Mexico) and pits in Durrington Walls (England).

The resulting charge can be several orders of magnitude lower than previously estimated upper limits, but it can surpass the pair production limit noted by Gibbons (1974) by a margin that increases with the amplitude of the black hole spin and the density of the plasma. We also implement a calculation for the net charge and magnetic moment of dark matter haloes when the dark matter is made of primordial black holes and also for astrophysical black holes that form part of the stellar halo of galaxies.

To construct $f(z)$, we take into account the Pad\\'e series, since this rational polynomial approximation offers a better convergence at high redshifts than the standard Taylor series expansion. Several orders of such an approximant have been proposed in previous works, here we want to answer the questions: What is the impact of the cosmographic series choice on the parameter constraints? Which series is the best for the analysis? So, we analyse the most promising ones by identifying which order is preferred in terms of stability and goodness of fit.

In conclusions, we state which series can be used when only late time data are used, while which orders has to be considered in order to achieve the necessary stability when large redshifts are considered.\n\n", "2309.15093": "2023-09-26, **Point-symmetry in SNR G1.9+0.3: A supernova that destroyed its planetary nebula progenitor**, Noam Soker et.al., [2309.15093v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15093v1)\n\n I analyze a new X-ray image of the youngest supernova remnant (SNR) in the Galaxy, which is the type Ia SNR G1.9+0.3, and reveal a very clear point-symmetrical structure. Since explosion models of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) do not form such morphologies, the point-symmetrical morphology must come from the circumstellar material (CSM) into which the ejecta expands. The large-scale point-symmetry that I identify and the known substantial deceleration of the ejecta of SNR G1.9+0.3 suggest a relatively massive CSM of >1Mo. I argue that the most likely explanation is the explosion of this SN Ia into a planetary nebula (PN). The scenario that predicts a large fraction of SN Ia inside PNe (SNIPs) is the core degenerate scenario. Other SN Ia scenarios might lead to only a very small fraction of SNIPs or not at all.\n\n", "2309.15046": "2023-09-26, **Rayleigh-Taylor Unstable Flames: the Coupled Effect of Multiple Perturbations**, Mingxuan Liu et.al., [2309.15046v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15046v1)\n\n The Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability is important in the fields of aerospace engineering, nuclear physics, and astrophysical research, particularly in studies of Type Ia supernovae. In some applications, the RT instability is complicated by a reaction at the unstable interface. In this paper, we show how this reaction changes the behavior of the RT instability. Using 2D direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Boussinesq premixed flames with a model reaction rate, we show how the flame responds to three types of perturbation: a large amplitude single mode primary perturbation, a smaller amplitude single mode secondary perturbation, and a numerically generated system perturbation with both single mode and multimode components. Early on, the evolution of the flame is dominated by the primary perturbation and, differently from single mode nonreacting RT, the flame propagates as a metastable traveling wave in the form of bubbles separated by cusp-like spikes. However, the lifetime of this traveling wave depends on the properties of the secondary and system perturbations and on the strength of gravity. Once the traveling wave is destabilized, the flame front bubbles rapidly grow to large scales. We identify five distinct flame growth solution types, with the symmetry and properties of each depending on the balance and interactions between the three types of perturbation. In particular, we show that the primary and secondary modes can couple to generate a tertiary mode which ultimately dominates the flow. Depending on the wavenumber of the tertiary mode, the flame may stall, develop coherent pulsations, or even become a metastable traveling wave again, behaviors not seen in nonreacting RT.\n\n", "2309.14901": "2023-09-26, **Recovering lost light: discovery of supernova remnants with integral field spectroscopy**, H\u00e9ctor Mart\u00ednez-Rodr\u00edguez et.al., [2309.14901v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14901v1)\n\n We present results from a systematic search for broad ($\\geq$ 400 \\kms) \\ha\\ emission in Integral Field Spectroscopy data cubes of $\\sim$1200 nearby galaxies obtained with PMAS and MUSE. We found 19 unique regions that pass our quality cuts, four of which match the locations of previously discovered SNe: one Type IIP, and three Type IIn, including the well-known SN 2005ip. We suggest that these objects are young Supernova Remnants, with bright and broad \\ha\\ emission powered by the interaction between the SN ejecta and dense circumstellar material. The stellar ages measured at the location of these SNR candidates are systematically lower by about 0.5 dex than those measured at the location of core collapse SNe, implying that their progenitors might be shorter lived and therefore more massive than a typical CC SN progenitor.

To assess the impact of the uncertainties in the hyperonic sector on astrophysical observables, we introduce two additional models, namely FSU2H$^*$L and FSU2H$^*$U. These models cover the entire spectrum of variability of hyperonic potentials, as derived from experimental data. Our investigations reveal that these uncertainties extend their influence not only to the relative abundances of various particle species but also to the EoS itself and, consequently, have an impact on the global properties of both cold and hot neutron stars. Notably, their effects become more pronounced at large temperatures, owing to the increased presence of hyperons. These findings have direct implications for the outcomes of relativistic simulations of neutron star mergers and supernovae, emphasizing the need of accounting for hyperonic uncertainties to ensure the accuracy and reliability of such simulations in astrophysical contexts.\n\n", "2309.14725": "2023-09-26, **Citizen Science Time Domain Astronomy with Astro-COLIBRI**, Fabian Sch\u00fcssler et.al., [2309.14725v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14725v1)\n\n Astro-COLIBRI is an innovative tool designed for professional astronomers to facilitate the study of transient astronomical events. Transient events - such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and stellar mergers - are fleeting cataclysmic phenomena that can offer profound insights into the most violent processes in the universe. Revealing their secrets requires rapid and precise observations: Astro-COLIBRI alerts its users of new transient discoveries from observatories all over the world in real-time. The platform also provides observers the details they need to make follow-up observations.   Some of the transient phenomena available through Astro-COLIBRI are accessible by amateur astronomers and citizen scientists. A subset of the features dedicated to this growing group of users are highlighted here. They include the possibility of receiving only alerts on very bright events, the possibility of defining custom observer locations, as well as the calculation of optimized observation plans for searches for optical counterparts to gravitational wave events.\n\n", "2309.14716": "2023-09-26, **Expansion and ongoing cosmic ray acceleration in HESS J1731-347**, Victor Doroshenko et.al., [2309.14716v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14716v1)\n\n Diffusive shock acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) is considered one of the prime mechanisms for Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) acceleration. It is still unclear, however, whether SNRs can contribute to GCR spectrum up to the ``knee'' (1\\,PeV) band as acceleration to such energies requires an efficient magnetic field amplification process around the shocks. The presence of such a process is challenging to test observationally. Here we report on the detection of fast variability of the X-ray synchrotron emission from the forward shock in the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, which implies the presence of a strong ($\\sim$0.2\\,mG) field exceeding background values and thus of effective field amplification. We also report a direct measurement of the high forward shock expansion velocity of 4000-5500\\,km/s confirming that the SNR is expanding in a tenuous wind bubble blown by the SNR progenitor, is significantly younger (2.4-9\\,kyr) than previously assumed by some authors, and only recently started interaction with the dense material outside the bubble.
