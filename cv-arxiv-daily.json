Orlando et.al., [2408.12462v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12462v1)\n\n (Abridged) Core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) display complex morphologies and asymmetries, reflecting anisotropies from the explosion and early interactions with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Spectral analysis of these remnants can provide critical insights into supernova (SN) engine dynamics, the nature of progenitor stars, and the final stages of stellar evolution, including mass-loss mechanisms in the millennia leading up to the SN.   This white paper evaluates the potential of the Line Emission Mapper (LEM), an advanced X-ray probe concept proposed in response to NASA 2023 APEX call, to deliver high-resolution spectra of SNRs. Such capabilities would allow detailed analysis of parent SNe and progenitor stars, currently beyond our possibilities. We employed a hydrodynamic model that simulates the evolution of a neutrino-driven SN from core-collapse to a 2000-year-old mature remnant. This model successfully replicates the large-scale properties of Cassiopeia A at an age of about 350 years.   Using this model, we synthesized mock LEM spectra from different regions of the SNR, considering factors like line shifts and broadening due to plasma bulk motion and thermal ion motion, deviations from ionization and temperature equilibrium, and interstellar medium absorption. Analyzing these mock spectra with standard tools revealed LEM impressive capabilities. We demonstrated that fitting these spectra with plasma models accurately recovers the line-of-sight velocity of the ejecta, enabling 3D structure exploration of shocked ejecta, similar to optical methods. LEM also distinguishes between Doppler and thermal broadening of ion lines and measures ion temperatures near the limb of SNRs, providing insights into ion heating at shock fronts and cooling in post-shock flows. This study highlights LEM potential to advance our understanding of core-collapse SN dynamics and related processes.\n\n", "2408.12450": "2024-08-22, **Thermal and non-thermal dark matters with gravitational neutrino reheating**, Md Riajul Haque et.al., [2408.12450v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12450v1)\n\n We have discussed in detail how neutrinos produced from inflaton solely through gravitational interaction can successfully reheat the universe. For this, we have introduced the well-known Type-I seesaw neutrino model. Depending on seesaw model parameters, two distinct reheating histories have been realized and dubbed as i) Neutrino dominating: Following the inflaton domination, the universe becomes neutrino dominated, and their subsequent decay concludes the reheating process, and ii) Neutrino heating: Despite being sub-dominant compared to inflaton energy, neutrinos efficiently heat the thermal bath and produce the radiation dominated universe. Imposing baryon asymmetric yield, the $\\Delta N\\_{\\rm eff}$ constraint at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) considering primordial gravitational waves (PGW), we have arrived at the following constraints on reheating equation of state to lie within $0.5\\lesssim w\\_\\phi\\lesssim1.0$. In these neutrino-driven reheating backgrounds, we further performed a detailed analysis of both thermal and non-thermal production of dark matter (DM), invoking two minimal models, namely the Higgs portal DM and classical QCD pseudo scalar axion. An interesting correlation between seemingly uncorrelated DM and Type-I seesaw parameters has emerged when confronting various direct and indirect observations. When DMs are set to freeze-in, freeze-out, or oscillate during reheating, new parameter spaces open, which could be potentially detectable in future experiments, paving an indirect way to look into the early universe in the laboratory.\n\n", "2408.12448": "2024-08-22, **Nuclear Production and Analytic Attenuation of Energetic MeV Solar Dark Matter**, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., [2408.12448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12448v1)\n\n We propose a solar production mechanism of MeV dark matter to overcome the energy threshold in direct detection experiments.

We comprehensively study the phenomenology of the dark matter when it is heavier than the $e^- e^+$ threshold, namely twice the electron mass, considering the threshold effect on the dark matter decay into $e^- e^+$. The viable parameter region is found only in the threshold region, while the branching fraction of the decay into $e^- e^+$ (i.e., the $e^- e^+$ signal) never vanishes even at the threshold due to the effect.

The method is exact in the slow roll approximation but remains effective even when the slow roll conditions are temporarily violated such as in ultra slow roll models. With this method we construct new ultra slow roll scenarios and also models that reproduce the DM abundance within the slow roll regime.

Improved halo mass estimation for SDSS groups and measurement of the halo mass function**, Dingyi Zhao et.al., [2408.12442v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12442v1)\n\n In $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, galaxies form and evolve in their host dark matter (DM) halos. Halo mass is crucial for understanding the halo-galaxy connection. The abundance matching (AM) technique has been widely used to derive the halo masses of galaxy groups. However, quenching of the central galaxy can decouple the coevolution of its stellar mass and DM halo mass. Different halo assembly histories can also result in significantly different final stellar mass of the central galaxies. These processes can introduce substantial uncertainties in the halo masses derived from the AM method, particularly leading to a systematic bias between groups with star-forming centrals (blue groups) and passive centrals (red groups). To improve, we developed a new machine learning (ML) algorithm that accounts for these effects and is trained on simulations. Our results show that the ML method eliminates the systematic bias in the derived halo masses for blue and red groups and is, on average, $\\sim1/3$ more accurate than the AM method. With careful calibration of observable quantities from simulations and observations from SDSS, we apply our ML model to the SDSS Yang et al. groups to derive their halo masses down to $10^{11.5}\\mathrm{M\\_\\odot}$ or even lower. The derived SDSS group halo mass function agrees well with the theoretical predictions, and the derived stellar-to-halo mass relations for both red and blue groups matches well with those obtained from direct weak lensing measurements.

Perfect fluid descriptions ensure thermal equilibrium since they equilibrate immediately. However, interactions among different energy content of the Universe might prevent such rapid equilibration. This limitation calls for a more fundamental framework that incorporates these interactions directly at the level of the action. In earlier work, two of the authors demonstrated that an interacting dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) field theory action could be derived from a modified gravity action via a conformal transformation, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the field theory action and fluid for a unique interaction term [arXiv:2006.04618]. In this work, we extend that analysis by considering quadratic order Horndeski gravity, identifying two classes of models: field coupling and field-kinetic coupling. Our approach generalizes the coupling function for DE-DM interactions by incorporating an additional dependence on kinetic terms. We establish a field-to-fluid mapping for dark matter and find that this mapping only holds for a specific form of the interaction strength. Interestingly, we show that this interaction strength excludes non-gravitational interactions between dark energy and dark radiation. Numerical analysis reveals that purely kinetic interactions within the dark sector can significantly alter cosmological evolution compared to non-interacting scenarios, highlighting the strong dependence of cosmological dynamics on coupling strength.

Using chiral perturbation theory, we find that this leads to an upper bound on the dark-matter--nucleon scattering cross-section that is orders of magnitude stronger than existing astrophysical constraints. Furthermore, we compute new bounds from rare Kaon decays and find that these provide even stronger constraints.

This work develops analytical solutions for an anisotropic fluid sphere within the framework of the well-known Adler-Finch-Skea metric.

In this context, we model the temporal constituent of the $\\Theta$-field sector to characterize the contribution of dark matter within the gravitational matter source. We present an alternative approach to studying anisotropic self-gravitating structures. This approach incorporates additional field sources arising from gravitational decoupling, which act as the dark component. We explicitly verify whether the proposed model satisfies all the requirements for describing realistic compact structures in detail.

At later epochs, the spectra become more similar to those of the prototypical SN Ibn 2006jc. At early phases, the spectra of SN 2019cj show flash ionisation emission lines of C III, N III and He II superposed on a blue continuum. These features disappear after a few days, and then the spectra of SN 2019cj evolve similarly to those of SN 2018jmt. The spectra indicate that the two SNe exploded within a He-rich circumstellar medium (CSM) lost by the progenitors a short time before the explosion.
