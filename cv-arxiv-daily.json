To extend the probing range of cavity haloscopes, solutions addressing the unfavorable scaling of cavity volume with frequency must be developed. Here, we present a novel type of high-volume thin shell resonator for high frequency haloscope dark matter searches. The cavity is formed by two nested and coaxial right angle polygonal prisms enclosed within two flat endcaps. For the axion-sensitive (pseudo-)TM010 mode, finite element simulations yield form factor of the order of 0.8 and Q factor of the order of 60000 for a copper cavity at 4$\\,$K. High tunability of up to $\\sim 5\\%$ is achieved by reciprocal rotation of the two prisms, without significant changes in haloscope sensitivity. A prototype aluminium hexagonal cavity was built and tested, confirming the main characteristics of the design.\n\n", "2403.14397": "2024-03-21, **Probing Primordial Black Holes and Dark Matter Clumps in the Solar System with Gravimeter and GNSS Networks**, Michal Cuadrat-Grzybowski et.al., [2403.14397v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14397v1)\n\n We show that Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and gravimeters on Earth and in space can potentially offer the most accurate direct measurement of local density of near-Earth asteroid-mass Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Dark Matter (DM) clumps in the solar system by means of gravitational influence. Using semi-analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulation, this paper revisits the analysis of the trajectories of DM clumps in the solar system, including both captured objects and hyperbolic trajectories. A link is thus made between the frequency and distance of Earth overflights for a given mass flux, and a direct measure of dark matter clump density in the solar system. We then model the signature of a close flyby of a DM object on orbital data from GNSS satellites and gravity measurements from gravimeters. We thus obtain a first assessment of the single probe sensitivity. It paves the way for an exhaustive statistical analysis of 28 years of gravimeters and GNSS data to obtain observational constraints on the density of the PBHs and DM clumps within the solar system, for the mass range $[10^8-10^{17}]$ kg. In addition, our methodology offers a possibility of direct detection in cases where DM clumps are endowed with an additional long-range clump-matter fifth-force beyond gravity.\n\n", "2403.14247": "2024-03-21, **Hint of a long-range dark sector fifth force in the current cosmological data?**, Vidhya Ganesan et.al., [2403.14247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14247v1)\n\n Many previous studies have explored models of dynamically interacting dark energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$\\_0$ES. Our results, for the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero $\\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\\%$ Confidence Limit) corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the addition of SH$\\_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of $\\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of constraints on the dark sector interaction.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2403.14361": "2024-03-21, **Hubble Space Telescope images of SN 1987A: Evolution of the ejecta and the equatorial ring from 2009 to 2022**, Sophie Rosu et.al., [2403.14361v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14361v1)\n\n Supernova (SN) 1987A offers a unique opportunity to study how a spatially resolved SN evolves into a young supernova remnant (SNR). We present and analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations of SN 1987A obtained in 2022 and compare them with HST observations from 2009 to 2021. These observations allow us to follow the evolution of the equatorial ring (ER), the rapidly expanding ejecta, and emission from the center over a wide range in wavelength from 2000 to 11 000 AA. The ER has continued to fade since it reached its maximum ~8200 days after the explosion. In contrast, the ejecta brightened until day ~11000 before their emission levelled off; the west side brightened more than the east side, which we attribute to the stronger X-ray emission by the ER on that side. The asymmetric ejecta expand homologously in all filters, which are dominated by various emission lines from hydrogen, calcium, and iron. From this overall similarity, we infer the ejecta are chemically well-mixed on large scales. The exception is the diffuse morphology observed in the UV filters dominated by emission from the Mg II resonance lines that get scattered before escaping. The 2022 observations do not show any sign of the compact object that was inferred from highly-ionized emission near the remnant's center observed with JWST. We determine an upper limit on the flux from a compact central source in the [O III] HST image. The non-detection of this line indicates that the S and Ar lines observed with JWST originate from the O free inner Si - S - Ar rich zone and/or that the observed [O III] flux is strongly affected by dust scattering.\n\n", "2403.14106": "2024-03-21, **The disappearance of the blue and luminous progenitor of the Type IIn SN 2010jl**, Zexi Niu et.al., [2403.14106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14106v1)\n\n Type IIn supernovae (SNe) exhibit narrow hydrogen lines that arise from the strong interaction between ejecta and circumstellar material. It remains poorly understood, however, what progenitor stars give rise to these explosions. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the progenitor and environment of the nearby Type IIn SN 2010jl. With newer images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, we confirm that the previously reported progenitor candidate is a blend of the progenitor itself and a field star cluster in its close vicinity. SN 2010jl has now become much fainter than the progenitor. The progenitor is very blue and luminous with an effective temperature of log $T\\_{\\rm eff}/{\\rm K}$=4.26$^{+0.11}\\_{-0.09}$ and a luminosity of log $L/L\\_{\\odot}$ =6.52$^{+0.20}\\_{-0.16}$. It is located in a very young star-forming region, but its luminosity is much higher than that expected from the environmental stellar populations. We suggest that the progenitor was in outburst when observed. Its nature and evolutionary history remain to be investigated.\n\n"}}
