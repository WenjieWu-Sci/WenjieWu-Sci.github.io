A single generation of vector-like dark quarks, transforming under a $\\text{SU}(3)\\_\\text{D}$ gauge symmetry, is coupled to a real singlet scalar, which serves as a portal between the dark quark condensate and three generations of heavy sterile neutrinos. Such a dark sector and the Standard Model (SM) are kept in thermal equilibrium with each other via sizeable Yukawa couplings to the heavy neutrinos. In this framework the lightest dark baryon, which has spin $3/2$ and is stabilized at the renormalizable level by an accidental dark baryon number symmetry, can account for the observed relic density via thermal freeze-out from annihilations into the lightest dark mesons.

Recent works that directly simulate the quantum kinetic transport of neutrinos in localized domains have suggested that the asymptotic outcome of FFCs can be modeled by simple analytical prescriptions. In this Letter, we incorporate the analytical prescriptions into global simulations that solve the classical neutrino transport equation including collisions and advection under spherical symmetry. We demonstrate excellent agreement between results obtained using this approach and those directly from the corresponding global quantum kinetic simulations. In particular, this effective method can also precisely capture the collisional feedback effect for cases where the FFC happens inside the neutrinosphere.

Once LQG provides a viable way to consistently understand this picture, we pursue an analysis of this effective Dirac equation to inspect some of its properties. These include: the derivation of the modified fermionic propagator, attainment of the Gordon decomposition of the vector current with minimal electromagnetic coupling to obtain information on the form factors, examination of the non-relativistic limit of the equation, evaluation of the spin- and velocity-dependent corrections to the Coulomb potential due to LQG effects, and the modified Hamiltonian in the low-relativistic regime.

In this context, the neutrino masses are generated through the canonical seesaw mechanism and a Majorana dark matter candidate is predicted from anomaly cancellation. We discuss in great detail the dark matter annihilation channels and find out the upper bound on the symmetry breaking scale using the cosmological bounds on the relic density. Since in this context the dark matter candidate has suppressed couplings to the Standard Model quarks, one can satisfy the direct detection bounds even if the dark matter mass is close to the electroweak scale.

In particular, we compare power spectra data produced by EuclidEmulator2, HMcode and halofit, all supplemented with the halo model reaction to model beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM physics. We investigate BNN-classifiers trained on these sets of spectra, adding in Stage-IV survey noise and various theoretical error models.

We find that the predicted background neutrino flux is mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and progenitor metallicity. For the optimistic cases in which the typical initial explosion energy is low, the diffuse flux of DNNB is comparable to the diffuse supernova neutrino background, which might be detected by the upcoming larger neutrino detectors such as Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, and DUNE.

W.

Collective stellar winds from massive member stars form a wind-blown bubble with a termination shock (TS) at which particle acceleration to PeV energies may occur. Furthermore, shock acceleration may occur at SNRs expanding inside the bubble. By applying a model of CR acceleration at both the wind TS and SNR shocks to catalogues of known SCs derived from Gaia DR2, we identify the most promising targets to search for evidence of PeVatron activity. Predictions for the secondary fluxes of gamma-ray and neutrino emission are derived based on particle acceleration at the collective wind TS and the subsequent hadronic interactions with the surrounding medium. Predictions from our modelling under baseline and optimistic scenarios are compared to data, finding consistent results. We estimate the detection prospects for future gamma-ray and neutrino experiments. We find that degree-scale angular sizes of the wind-blown bubbles are typical, that may pose a challenge for experimental detection. A shortlist of the most promising candidates is provided, with an anticipated flux range. Of order 10 SCs may be detectable with future facilities, and 1-5 could be currently operating as PeVatrons. Of these, three gamma-ray detected SCs have data within our predicted range. Our model can consistently describe gamma-ray measurements of SC emission. Several further as-yet-undetected SCs offer promising targets for future observations, although the flux range allowed by our model can be large (> factor 10). The large angular size of the wind-blown bubble may lead to low surface brightness emission, worsening the problem of source confusion.

We will consider five different models for the Earth's density profile and estimate how these different models modify the target column density and transmission coefficients for different flavors. The results are derived by solving the cascade equations taking into account the NC interactions and tau regeneration. A comparison with approximated solutions is also presented.

The underlying phenomenology describing such transient variations relies on models for Dark Matter (DM) which suggest possible encounters of macroscopic compact objects with the Earth, due to the motion of the solar system in the galactic halo. If such compact objects possess an effective feeble interaction with the ordinary matter beyond the gravitational one, it may result in effective transient variations of fundamental constants.

In this paper, we introduce a phenomenological study dedicated to the search for such DM transient objects using the network of passive hydrogen masers (H-Masers) onboard Galileo satellites. We first model the signature of transient variations of fundamental constants as a frequency modulation in the difference between two satellite clocks, considering the satellite trajectories relative to the transient event.

The correlation among mass, size, and angular momentum of galaxies is examined by comparing simulations with observations and the theoretical predictions of the exponential hypothesis. Galaxies with tiny stellar halos exhibit a large scatter in the $j\\_\\star$-$M\\_\\star$ relation, which suggests that it is inherently present in their initial conditions. The analysis reveals that the disks of these galaxies adhere to the exponential hypothesis, resulting in a tight fiducial $j\\_\\star$-$M\\_\\star$-scale length (size) relation that is qualitatively consistent with observations. The inherent scatter in $j\\_\\star$ provides a robust explanation for the mass-size relation and its substantial variability.

Cooling of the hot atmosphere supplies the central regions with fresh gas, igniting active galactic nuclei (AGN) with long duty cycles. Outflows from the central engine tightly couple with the surrounding gaseous medium and provide the dominant heating source preventing runaway cooling. Every major modern hydrodynamical simulation suite now includes a prescription for AGN feedback to reproduce realistic populations of galaxies. However, the mechanisms governing the feeding/feedback cycle between the central black holes and their surrounding galaxies and halos are still poorly understood.

Our main study focuses on three simulations from identical initial conditions at $z=127$, one following dark matter only, one including non-radiative gas, and one additionally including the baryonic physics relevant in this halo mass range (cooling and photoheating). In the non-radiative simulation, above $10^{5.5}~\\mathrm{M\\_\\odot}$, halo abundance and internal structure are very similar to the dark-matter-only simulation, and the baryon to dark matter ratio is everywhere close to the cosmic value. At lower mass, this ratio drops and haloes are less concentrated and less massive in the non-radiative case. Test simulations at higher resolution show this to be mainly a resolution effect; the expected drop in baryon content due to residual pressure effects only becomes substantial for $z=0$ haloes below $\\sim 10^{2.7}~\\mathrm{M\\_\\odot}$.

In this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.\n\n", "2403.16807": "2024-03-25, **A serendipitous discovery of HI-rich galaxy groups with MeerKAT**, M. Glowacki et.al., [2403.16807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16807v1)\n\n We report on the serendipitous discovery of 49 HI-rich galaxies in a 2.3 hour Open Time observation with MeerKAT. We present their properties including their HI masses, intensity and velocity maps, and spectra. We determine that at least three HI-rich galaxy groups have been detected, potentially as part of a supergroup. Some members of these galaxy groups show clear interaction with each other in their HI emission. We cross-match the detections with PanSTARRS, WISE and GALEX, and obtain stellar masses and star formation rates. One source is found to be a potential OH megamaser, but further follow-up is required to confidently determine this. For 6 sources with sufficient spatial resolution in HI we produce rotation curves with BBarolo, generate mass models, and derive a dark matter halo mass. While the number of galaxies detected in this relatively short pointing appears to be at the high end of expectations compared to other MeerKAT observations and group HIMF studies, this finding highlights the capability of MeerKAT for other serendipitous discoveries, and the potential for many more HI-rich galaxies to be revealed within both existing and upcoming Open Time datasets.\n\n", "2403.16754": "2024-03-25, **Radial Acceleration Relation of HI-rich Low Surface Brightness Galaxies**, Zi-chen Hua et.al., [2403.16754v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16754v1)\n\n We investigate the radial acceleration relation (RAR) in low surface brightness galaxies selected from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. We find that the dynamical acceleration $g\\_{\\rm obs}$ and baryonic gravitational acceleration $g\\_{\\rm bar}$ of the HI-rich low surface brightness galaxies still follow the universal RAR of typical late-type galaxies. The universal RAR signifies a consistent correlation between the distribution of baryonic matter and dark matter across galaxies with diverse morphologies and properties. Our findings suggest that the matter distributions in low surface brightness galaxies may indeed resemble that of general late-type galaxies. This implies that low surface brightness galaxies may not originate from dark matter halos with lower densities; instead, they may originate from the dark matter halos with high spins or form through feedback processes.\n\n", "2403.16633": "2024-03-25, **SASHIMI-SIDM: Semi-analytical subhalo modelling for self-interacting dark matter at sub-galactic scales**, Shin'ichiro Ando et.al., [2403.16633v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16633v1)\n\n We combine the semi-analytical structure formation model, SASHIMI, which predicts subhalo populations in collisionless, cold dark matter (CDM), with a parametric model that maps CDM halos to self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The resulting model, SASHIMI-SIDM, generates SIDM subhalo populations down to sub-galactic mass scales, for an arbitrary input cross section, in minutes. We show that SASHIMI-SIDM agrees with SIDM subhalo populations from high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations in resolved regimes. Crucially, we predict that the fraction of core-collapsed subhalos peaks at a mass scale determined by the input SIDM cross section and decreases toward higher halo masses, consistent with the predictions of gravothermal models and cosmological simulations. For the first time, we also show that the core-collapsed fraction decreases toward lower halo masses; this result is uniquely enabled by our semi-analytical approach. As a proof of principle, we apply SASHIMI-SIDM to predict the boost to the local dark matter density and annihilation rate from core-collapsed SIDM subhalos, which can be enhanced relative to CDM by an order of magnitude for viable SIDM models. Thus, SASHIMI-SIDM provides an efficient and reliable tool for scanning SIDM parameter space and testing it with astrophysical observations.

Metric formalism of $f(R)$ theory is considered in this study. A mathematical transformation tool called conformal transformation which transforms the action from Jordan to Einstein frame is employed to simplify the fourth-order modified field equation and to describe the extra degree of freedom $f\\_R$ by using a minimally coupled scalar field (scalaron) showing the chameleonic character. Then, we examine the viability of a newly introduced $f(R)$ gravity model on behalf of the chameleonic behavior of the scalaron. The model analyzes this behavior of the scalaron successfully with the singularity correction. Further, we consider a test particle (star) in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime to investigate the importance of the scalaron in galactic dynamics. In the non-relativistic limit, the rotational velocity equation for the particle with scalaron contribution is derived. This contribution is found to be model dependent. We generate the rotation curves using the velocity equation and fit the predicted curves to observational data of a set of thirty seven sample galaxies of different categories.

We can regard both the changes of photon sphere radius and impact parameter before and after phase transition as the order parameter; their critical exponents near the critical point are equal to the same value 1/2, just like ordinary thermal systems.

This work focuses on Wolf-Rayet stars as progenitors. The magnetic field amplification in the free wind region (shock upstream region) is not considered in this work. Test particle simulations show that particles escaped from the core-collapse SNR reach and move along the WTS, and eventually return to the SNR shock from the poles or equator of the WTS. The particle attainable energy can be boosted by this cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS and can be larger than the particle energy that is limited by escape from the SNR shock. The particle energy limited by the cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS is about $10-100~{\\rm TeV}$. Thus, the core-collapse SNR without upstream magnetic field amplification can be the origin of the break around $10~{\\rm TeV}$ of the energy spectrum of observed cosmic ray protons and helium.\n\n", "2403.17198": "2024-03-25, **Runaway OB Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud III.

We update the proper motions for field OB and OBe stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Gaia DR3. Our sample now contains 336 stars from the Runaways and Isolated O-Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4), and we update our algorithm to calculate more accurate velocities compared to those obtained previously from DR2. We find a decrease in median velocity from 39 to 29 km/s, implying that the proper motions from our previous work were systematically overestimated. We present the velocity distribution for OBe stars and quantitatively compare it to those of non-compact binaries and high-mass X-ray binaries. We confirm that OBe stars appear to be dominated by the BSS and are likely post-SN binary systems, further supporting the mass-transfer model to explain the origin of their emission-line disks. In contrast, normal OB stars may show a bimodal velocity distribution, as may be expected from different processes that occur with dynamical ejections. The kinematics of fast-rotating OB stars are similar to those of normal OB stars rather than OBe stars, suggesting that the origin of their high v\\_r*sin(i) is different from that of OBe stars.

R. Magee et.al., [2403.16889v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16889v1)\n\n Multiple explosion mechanisms have been proposed to explain type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Through forward modelling, synthetic observables of explosion models can be directly compared to observations of SNe Ia to constrain the explosion physics. Due to the computational expense associated with multi-dimensional explosion and radiative transfer simulations however, empirical modelling tools have also been developed that allow for fast, customised modelling of individual SNe. Such tools have provided useful insights, but the subjective nature with which empirical modelling is performed makes it difficult to obtain robust constraints on the explosion physics or expand studies to large populations of objects. Machine learning accelerated tools have therefore begun to gain traction. In this paper, we present riddler, a framework for automated fitting of SNe Ia spectral sequences up to shortly after maximum light. We train a series of neural networks on realistic ejecta profiles predicted by the W7 and N100 explosion models to emulate full radiative transfer simulations and apply nested sampling to determine the best-fitting model parameters for multiple spectra of a given SN simultaneously. We show that riddler is able to accurately recover the parameters of input spectra and use it to fit observations of two well-studied SNe Ia. We also investigate the impact of different weighting schemes when performing quantitative spectral fitting. As spectroscopic samples of SNe Ia continue to grow, automated spectral fitting tools such as riddler will become increasingly important to maximise the physical constraints that can be gained in a quantitative and consistent manner.\n\n", "2403.16675": "2024-03-25, **Self-similar solutions in cylindrical magneto-hydrodynamic blast waves with energy injection at the centre**, Antoine Gintrand et.al., [2403.16675v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16675v1)\n\n The evolution of shocks induced by massive stars does not depend only on the ambient magnetic field strength, but also on its orientation. In the present work, the dynamics of a magnetized blast wave is investigated under the influence of both azimuthal and axial ambient magnetic fields. The blast wave is driven by a central source and forms a shell that results from the accumulation of interstellar matter behind the shock front. A similarity form of the ambient magnetic field and a cylindrical geometry of the blast wave are assumed to obtain self-similar solutions. The model is studied separately for both azimuthal and axial magnetic field and applied to stellar wind bubbles and supernova remnants respectively, using 1D numerical simulations. We found that the magnetized blast wave differs from the self-similar case without an ambient magnetic field. The forward shock front goes slower in the azimuthal case and faster in the axial one. For both tangential orientations, the thickness of the shell increases with the magnetic strength. In the azimuthal case, the thermal energy can be converted to magnetic energy near the inner boundary of the shell. Thus, the temperature drops and the magnetic field increases at the tangential discontinuity of the stellar wind bubble.
