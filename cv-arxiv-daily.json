The key advantages of the model include the appearance of a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) like dark matter (DM) candidate from the neutral component of the IHD, along with the plausible explanation of the sub-eV mass range of SM neutrinos via the radiative seesaw mechanism. Additionally, the decay of RHNs can contextualize the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis and is intricately connected to CP violation. Also, given the ongoing searches for light scalars at various experimental facilities, the extended Higgs sector of the model continues to be at the forefront. However, this scotogenic framework encounters a deficiency in providing the observed amount of relic density for a particular mass range $\\sim (80 - 500) $ GeV of its DM candidate, hence requiring further augmentation. Also, the WIMP scenarios have not yet resulted in conclusive hints at the direct detection experiments. In this context, our work is based on further extension of the above Scotogenic model by a dark sector. Additionally, considering the cosmic coincidence aspect, we operate within the framework of two-sector leptogenesis. To have a predictive flavor structure in the visible sector, we impose $A\\_4$ symmetry. Also, we adhere to spontaneous CP violation via complex vacuum expectation value of the falvon field, leading to a situation where there is only one CP-violating phase as a common connection between the visible and dark sectors.

In this picture, visibility corresponds to interference strength, predictability to flavor imbalance, and entanglement to the reduction of purity due to flavor correlations. We demonstrate that neutrino oscillations naturally exhibit regimes of maximal entanglement, vanishing coherence, and entanglement monogamy constraining flavor correlations.

This analysis is carried out using the GM1 and NL3 parameter sets under the SU(6) and SU(3) flavor symmetries in the relativistic mean field theory framework. Combined with the inferred mass and radius values of PSRs J1231-1411, J0030+0451, and J0740+6620, our results show that nucleonic direct Urca processes are absent in PSR J1231-1411 due to momentum conservation violation. In hyperon-containing PSR J0030+0451 (NL3 parameter set), the nucleonic direct Urca processes involving $e^{-}$/ $\\mu^{-}$ would occur. A large inferred mass span induces hyperon fraction variations, affecting neutrino emissivity. If the inferred mass of PSR J0030+0451 exceeds approximately 1.8 $M\\_{\\odot}$, the neutrino luminosity of the nucleonic direct Urca processes under the SU(3) flavor symmetry remains nearly the same as that in npe$\\mu$ matter, without depending on hyperons.

Our previous research has fully demonstrated the performance of pure CsI at liquid nitrogen temperature. More intriguingly, its performance is expected to be even better at 40 K. However, the performance characteristics of SiPM in the 40 K temperature range still remain to be explored.

Special emphasis was placed on examining the key performance parameters of SiPM in the 40 K temperature range to evaluate its feasibility for light yield measurement in this temperature range.

Our analysis reveals that PFDM induces notable deviations in the shadow size, shape, and circularity, and significantly impacts the stability of circular orbits. Furthermore, the energy emission rate exhibits a strong dependence on both the Yang--Mills charge and the dark matter distribution.

Captured DM particles migrate toward the helium-rich core and accumulate into a compact configuration. As the DM population grows, it can become self-gravitating and undergo gravitational collapse, leading to adiabatic contraction through interactions with the ambient medium. The resulting energy release, through elastic scattering and, where relevant, DM annihilation during collapse, locally heats the stellar core and can trigger helium ignition earlier than that predicted by standard stellar evolution. We analyze the conditions under which DM-induced heating leads to runaway helium burning and identify the critical DM mass required for ignition. Imposing the observational constraint that helium ignition must not occur before the observed luminosity at the tip of the RG branch, we translate these conditions into bounds on DM properties. Remarkably, we find that RGs are sensitive to DM, particularly with masses around $10^{11} \\,{\\rm GeV}$ and spin-independent scattering cross sections near $10^{-37}\\,{\\rm cm}^2$, which is comparable to the reach of current terrestrial direct detection experiments.\n\n", "2509.03283": "2025-09-03, **A two-phase model of galaxy formation: IV.

Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\\rm H}\\_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M\\_{\\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\\,{\\rm M}\\_\\odot$ at $z \\approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\\,{\\rm M}\\_\\odot$.

We use this factor to improve previous constraints on the scattering cross section of non-annihilating bosonic DM with baryonic matter, and derive upper bounds on this cross section from the observation of the binary NS merger associated with GW170817.

The stellar component is then transformed from a disk into a bar-like prolate spheroid. I investigated a subsample of 77 bar-like galaxies tidally induced in the cluster environment, selected among the previously studied sample of bar-like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations. I present six clear, convincing examples of bar-like galaxies formed after an interaction with a progenitor of a massive brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and describe the properties of their bars. For the whole sample, the time of bar formation is strongly correlated with and typically slightly greater than the time of the pericenter passage. All galaxies are strongly stripped of dark matter and gas, and their rotation is similarly diminished. A larger pericenter distance typically requires a higher host mass in order to transform the galaxy, but the interactions show no preference for prograde configurations. The final strength of the bars does not correlate with the amount of tidal stripping experienced because of the variety of initial properties of the progenitors and the subsequent evolution over the next pericenter passages.

Several non-CDM models predict that the DM distribution thermalizes over time, transforming initially cuspy halos into cores. This transformation weakens the gravitational potential, allowing the stellar component to expand and form diffuse, core-like structures. Using analytical models and adiabatic invariants, we examine stellar systems with purely tangential, purely radial, and isotropic orbits evolving under a slowly changing potential. Across a wide range of initial and final conditions, we find that stellar cores form relatively easily, though their properties depend sensitively on these conditions. Orbit types preserve their nature during the DM halo expansion: tangential and radial orbits remain so, while isotropic orbits remain nearly isotropic in the central regions. Systems with circular orbits develop stellar cores when the initial stellar density logarithmic slope lies between -0.5 and -1.2, whereas radial systems do not form cores. Isotropic systems behave similarly to tangential ones, producing cores that are isotropic in the center but develop increasing radial anisotropy outward; the anisotropy parameter \"beta\" grows from sim 0.07 at the core radius to sim 0.5 at three core radii. The theoretical and observational literature suggests initial DM profiles with steep slopes and stellar distributions that are shallower and isotropic at the center.

The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely with the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a coherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even exceeding $10\\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter reconstructions.

This constraint, which excludes the \"fuzzy\" range of ultra-light dark matter from comprising all of the DM, relies on an estimate of the heating rate from fuzzy dark matter (FDM) wave interference using linear perturbation theory. Here, we compare the results of this perturbative calculation to full Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson simulations of the evolution of star particles in FDM halos. This comparison confirms theoretical expectations that FDM heating is stronger in fully nonlinear simulations due to the formation of a dense central soliton whose fluctuations enhance gravitational perturbations, and that bounds on the DM particle mass using this perturbative method are indeed conservative. We also show that these bounds are not affected by possible tidal stripping, since for dwarf satellites like Segue 1, the tidal radius is much larger than the observed size of the galaxy. We further show that the constraints on the mass cannot be evaded by invoking DM self-interactions, due to constraints on the self-interaction from large-scale structure.

In the minimal setup, the neutral component of a pure $SU(2)$ doublet vector-like lepton fails to simultaneously account for the observed relic abundance while remaining consistent with current direct detection limits. We show that the addition of the scalar leptoquarks can induce corrections to the mass of the vector-like lepton dark matter, splitting it into two non-degenerate pseudo-Dirac states.

This saturation is independent of radiation and dust density, occurring in the low-temperature regime where the BH's surface gravity and Hawking temperature decrease. Our results suggest that rotating BHs subjected to a phenomenological representation of a more realistic matter environment can scramble information as efficiently as allowed by physical laws in this limit.

Works inferring the star formation histories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that the assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the well-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else indicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these studies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of observation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models like CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller galaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of stars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use the TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy masses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs. I demonstrate that the assumption of in-situ stellar mass assembly can lead to significant biases in inferred stellar mass histories, with historic (i.e. looking back from the epoch of observation) stellar masses overestimated by over an order of magnitude in some cases. The bias increases with increasing halo mass, for inferences made further from the epoch of observation, and with decreasing descendant galaxy redshift. I derive corrections that can be applied to inferred stellar mass histories for more robust comparisons with dark matter halo mass functions at high redshift.\n\n", "2509.02694": "2025-09-02, **Self-similar kinetics for gravitational Bose-Einstein condensation**, A.

In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are used to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large enough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass haloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect on the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark matter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per cent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations. We propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its parameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects two orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual objects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the population is correctly predicted, can dramatically improve the available constraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our experiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in the lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are strongly degenerate with the population signal, to an even greater extent than with individual subhaloes.

The strange quark matter (SQM) is described with the well-known Nambu-Jona-Lasino (NJL) model and the self-interacting fermionic DM is included in a systematic manner. The self-interaction of DM is of four-Fermi type and the overall DM density is considered as a function of the baryon density of SQM with two free parameters ($\\alpha$, $\\rho\\_{sc}$). This work is the first to consider four-Fermi interactions between fermionic DM and SQM in DMSQSs. Certain experiments like LZ, XENON, DarkSide, CRESST, and LHC have almost ruled out the possibility of contact interaction between SQM and massive DM (in GeV order). Recently, the quest for sub-GeV DM has garnered significant attention. We show that recent astrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars also do not support the presence of massive DM in DMSQSs. On the other hand, we find sub-GeV DM to successfully concur with such observational constraints. We also calculate the fundamental $f$-mode frequency ($f\\_f$) of the DMSQSs, which shows universality with compactness, mean density, and tidal deformability.

In this paper, we focused on the main lensing galaxy ($z$ = 0.260) of the doubly imaged gravitationally lensed quasar FBQ 0951+2635 ($z$ = 1.246) for probing possible PBH populations. Assuming that the mass of the galaxy is due to smoothly distributed matter (SDM), stars, and PBHs, the 16-yr observed microlensing variability was compared in detail with simulated microlensing signals generated by 90 different physical scenarios. Among other details, the simulated signals were sampled as the observed one, and the observed variability in its entirety and over the long term were used separately for comparison. While none of the scenarios considered can reproduce the overall observed signal, the observed long-term variability favours a small mass fraction in PBHs with a mass of the order of the mean stellar mass. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain strong constraints on the galaxy mass fraction in Jupiter-mass PBHs, provided that a reverberation-based measurement of the source size is available and relatively small.

Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension between early- and late-universe constraints within both frameworks: ACT favors a quintom scenario where the dark energy equation of state (EoS) evolves from $w>-1$ at early times to $w<-1$ at late times, while DESI+DESY5 exhibits a distinct preference for quintessence where $w>-1$ across cosmic evolution. The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely with the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a coherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even exceeding $10\\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter reconstructions. Based on the combined data, Bayesian evidence decisively disfavors both HDE and RDE models relative to the $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, with ACT providing decisive disfavor and DESI+DESY5 yielding moderate disfavor.

We then examine links between Si II $\\lambda$6355 velocities, light-curve stretch $x\\_{1}$, colour $c$, and host properties to explore potential environmental and/or progenitor-related effects.

However, there are currently substantial uncertainties in the low-metallicity, low-luminosity thin wind regime where classical diagnostics (H-alpha and ultraviolet, UV, P Cygni profiles) yield wind momenta that are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude below prescriptions implemented by default in most evolutionary models. Here, we present spectra of the mass-loss diagnostic line Br-alpha in 15 OB-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using the Near Infrared Spectrograph on the James Webb Space Telescope. The line profile morphology, recovered by virtue of the outstanding signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the avoidance of regions with nebular emission, is consistent with predictions based on previous mass-loss rate estimates from optical and UV spectroscopy.

Higher SFE values can only be reached if Ly$\\alpha$-driven shells fragment and form stars.

The $\\Delta L\\_{W2}$ of 25 variable ULIRGs out of 30 are greater than $\\Delta L\\_{W2}$ = $1\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, surpassing the MIR luminosity {range} observed in known supernovae (SNe; $L\\_{\\rm 3.6\\ {\\rm \\mu m}}$ and $L\\_{\\rm 4.5\\ {\\rm \\mu m}}$ < 10$^{42.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Therefore, the MIR variabilities in these 25 ULIRGs are most likely driven by tidal disruption events (TDEs) or intrinsic changes in their active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus emission. Our sample includes hard X-ray detected AGNs (e.g., UGC 05101) and previously reported TDE candidates (IRAS F01004-2237, IRAS 05189-2524). All 25 also exhibit at least one AGN signature(s) besides the MIR variability, suggesting that even if the MIR variability originates from TDEs, the black holes responsible are likely AGNs. Our results suggest that MIR variability is an effective tool for detecting buried AGNs and highlights the intense nuclear activity in ULIRGs.\n\n", "2509.01933": "2025-09-02, **The survey of DA double white dwarf candidates based on DESI EDR**, Ziyue Jiang et.al., [2509.01933v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01933v1)\n\n Mergers of double white dwarfs are considered significant potential progenitors of type Ia supernovae. Although there is no direct observational evidence to definitively determine the formation pathways of SNe Ia, studying the physical properties of DWDs provides valuable insights into their evolutionary processes, interaction modes, and merger mechanisms, which are essential for understanding the explosion mechanisms of SNe Ia. This study aims to identify DWD candidates through spectroscopic radial velocity measurements and analyze their physical properties based on DESI EDR. We crossmatched DESI EDR with the Gaia EDR3 to select DA. We measured the spectroscopic RV using the cross-correlation function and assessed the significance of RV variability using a chi-squared-based variability method. Spectroscopic Teff and log g were derived by fitting the hydrogen Balmer lines, with 3D convection corrections applied. Orbital periods and semi-amplitudes were obtained through a Lomb-Scargle analysis of the RV time series. We interpolated WD cooling models and applied Monte Carlo simulations to calculate masses, cooling ages, radii, and their associated uncertainties. We also analyzed their photometric and spectral energy distribution properties to derive photometric temperatures and radii, which were then compared with the corresponding spectroscopic parameters. We identified 33 DA DWD candidates with significant RV variability, including 28 new discoveries. Among them, we found an extremely low-mass DWD candidate and a potential triple system. For these candidates, we measured key physical parameters including Teff, log g, mass, and radius, and estimated the orbital periods based on the available data. Of these, 17 candidates exhibit relatively clear periodic RV variability in the current data, and we report their best-fitting periods and RV semi-amplitudes.\n\n", "2509.01881": "2025-09-02, **One latent to fit them all: a unified representation of baryonic feedback on matter distribution**, Shurui Lin et.al., [2509.01881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01881v1)\n\n Accurate and parsimonious quantification of baryonic feedback on matter distribution is of crucial importance for understanding both cosmology and galaxy formation from observational data. This is, however, challenging given the large discrepancy among different models of galaxy formation simulations, and their distinct subgrid physics parameterizations. Using 5,072 simulations from 4 different models covering broad ranges in their parameter spaces, we find a unified 2D latent representation. Compared to the simulations and other phenomenological models, our representation is independent of both time and cosmology, much lower-dimensional, and disentangled in its impacts on the matter power spectra. The common latent space facilitates the comparison of parameter spaces of different models and is readily interpretable by correlation with each. The two latent dimensions provide a complementary representation of baryonic effects, linking black hole and supernova feedback to distinct and interpretable impacts on the matter power spectrum. Our approach enables developing robust and economical analytic models for optimal gain of physical information from data, and is generalizable to other fields with significant modeling uncertainty.\n\n"}}
