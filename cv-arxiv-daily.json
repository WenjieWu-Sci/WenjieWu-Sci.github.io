Here we introduce tracking spectroscopy of $\\beta$-$\\gamma$ cascades, a method that reconstructs decay vertices while simultaneously detecting $\\beta$ particles and all associated de-excitation energies. Using the PandaX-4T detector operated as a tracking spectrometer, we obtain a precise and unbiased decay scheme of $^{214}$Pb, a key background isotope in searches for dark matter and Majorana neutrinos. For the first time, transitions of $^{214}$Pb to both the ground and excited states of $^{214}$Bi are measured concurrently, revealing discrepancies in branching ratios of up to 4.7$\\sigma$ relative to previous evaluations.

We explore two primary scenarios for the distribution of UHECR sources, assuming that their production rate follows either the cosmic star-formation-rate or stellar-mass density. By jointly fitting the UHECR energy spectrum and mass composition measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory above the ankle (10^{18.7} eV), we derive constraints on the acceleration mechanisms, source energetics, and elemental abundances at escape. Using these constraints, we generate sky maps above 40 EeV based on a catalog of over 400,000 galaxies out to 350 Mpc, providing a near-infrared flux-limited sample that maps the two stellar-activity tracers across the full sky. A crucial factor in understanding UHECR propagation is the influence of large-scale cosmic structures, particularly galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound systems in the Universe, which are filled with magnetized diffuse plasma. Intermittent sources hosted in galaxies within such structures, coupled with cosmic magnetic fields, shape the observed UHECR arrival directions and provide insights into the burst rate of the sources. We show that these environments can significantly impact UHECR transport, making them particularly opaque to heavy nuclei. Additionally, we compute the expected secondary neutrino and photon fluxes from UHECR interactions in these environments and compare them with current experimental limits, constraining the maximum energy that particles can achieve. Finally, we assess the compatibility of these constraints with astrophysical candidates, identifying long gamma-ray bursts as the most promising sources.\n\n", "2510.24395": "2025-10-28, **Optimising Underwater Neutrino Telescopes for All-Flavour Point Source Sensitivity**, Iwan Morton-Blake et.al., [2510.24395v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24395v1)\n\n High-energy neutrino astronomy has advanced rapidly in recent years, with IceCube, KM3NeT, and Baikal-GVD establishing a diffuse astrophysical flux and pointing to promising source candidates. These achievements mark the transition from first detections to detailed source studies, motivating next-generation detectors with larger volumes, improved angular resolution, and full neutrino-flavour sensitivity. We present a performance study of large underwater neutrino telescopes, taking the proposed TRIDENT array in the South China Sea as a case study, with a focus on comparing the performance of various detector configurations against the TRIDENT baseline design. Both track-like events primarily from muon neutrinos, which provide precise directional information, and cascade events from all flavours, which offer superior energy resolution, diffuse-source sensitivity, and all-sky flavour coverage, are included to achieve a balanced performance across source types. The time to discover potential astrophysical sources with both track- and cascade-like events is used as the figure of merit to compare a variety of detector design choices. Our results show that, for a fixed number of optical modules, simply enlarging the instrumented volume does not inherently lead to improved performance, while taller strings can provide modest gains across all detector channels, within engineering constraints. Distributing dense clusters of strings over a large volume is found to generally worsen discovery potential compared to the baseline layout.

Their thermal and luminosity evolution reflects key internal properties such as the equation of state (EoS), nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity, envelope composition, and magnetic field, and so on. Recent observations [\\textit{e.g.}, V. Abramkin \\textit{et al.,} ApJ \\textbf{924}, 128 (2022)] have revealed unexpectedly warm old neutron stars, which cannot be explained by standard neutrino-photon cooling models. The failure of the standard cooling models implies the presence of additional internal heating mechanism. Building on the previous study [M. Fujiwara \\textit{et al}., JCAP \\textbf{03}, 051 (2024)], which proposed vortex creep heating (VCH) from the frictional motion of superfluid vortices as a viable mechanism, we extend the cooling framework to include both VCH and direct Urca (DUrca) processes. These are implemented in our code to explore their combined impact, particularly for massive neutron stars where DUrca operates. By varying rotational parameters ($P$, $\\dot{P}$, $P\\_0$), EoS models (APR, BSk24), pairing gaps, and envelope compositions, we examine how heating-cooling interplay shapes the temperature evolution.

Using numerical experiments, we show that the approximations of FFC that have been implemented so far are limited by at least two of three factors: (1) approximating continuous evolution as a discrete sequence of instabilities, (2) using spatially homogeneous asymptotic states, and (3) assuming that FFC must be accompanied by instability.

In contrast to canonical WIMPs, which are now strongly constrained by direct and indirect searches, secluded models still achieve the observed relic abundance via thermal freeze-out into hidden-sector mediators, while predicting highly suppressed present-day signals. We analyze three minimal models: (i) a $U(1)\\_X$ gauge boson ($A'$) with kinetic mixing; (ii) a scalar DM candidate $S$ with a scalar mediator $K$ that has a trilinear vertex; and (iii) a Dirac fermion $\\chi$ whose mass arises from a Higgs-mixed singlet $H\\_p$. For each model we derive annihilation and scattering rates in both WIMP-like and secluded regimes, and solve the Boltzmann equations: a single-species equation for the WIMP case and a coupled $\\chi$-$\\phi$ system for the secluded case to account for possible early departure of the mediator from thermal equilibrium with the SM bath. In this regard, we provide explicit lower limits on the portal coupling $\\epsilon$ required to keep the mediator in thermal equilibrium with the SM bath and to ensure mediator decay before BBN. We show that for portal couplings $\\epsilon \\ll 10^{-3}$ the relic density is dominantly controlled by DM annihilation into mediator pairs, while spin-independent scattering lies well below current limits and remains viable even for future experiments approaching the irreducible neutrino background floor.

Neutrinos are virtual particles in this formalism. Neutrino mass eigenstates are supposed to be Dirac fermions. We consider two cases of external fields: the neutrino electroweak interaction with background matter and the interaction with an external magnetic field owing to the presence of the transition magnetic moment. The formalism used involves the dressed propagators of mass eigenstates in external fields. In the matter case, finding of these propagators for Dirac neutrinos has certain difficulties compared to the Majorana particles considered previously. These difficulties are overcome by regularizing the effective potential of the neutrino interaction with matter. The QFT formalism application to the spin-flavor precession also encounters certain peculiarities in the Dirac case compared to the Majorana one. They are related to the observability of right polarized Dirac neutrinos. We derive the matrix elements and the probabilities for Dirac neutrinos interacting with both types of external fields. In case of the spin-flavor precession, we obtain the small QFT contribution to the probabilities in addition to the prediction of the quantum mechanical approach.\n\n", "2510.23713": "2025-10-27, **Glimpsing Physics of Nano-Hz Gravitational Waves in Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae**, Hooman Davoudiasl et.al., [2510.23713v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23713v1)\n\n The growing evidence for nano-hertz gravitational waves, from NANOGrav and other observations, may be pointing to a cosmological first-order phase transition at temperatures of $\\mathcal{O}(10-100)\\;\\mathrm{MeV}$.

If so, it may well be the case that core-collapse supernova explosions would recreate the first-order phase transition leaving a unique imprint on the spectrum of neutrinos emitted in the initial few seconds.

Our analysis focuses on light (semi)relativistic dark matter, which may originate from cosmic-ray boosting and can be probed in high threshold experiments such as large-volume neutrino detectors. In this context, the nucleon matrix elements of the effective operators at finite momentum transfer are required, made available through recent advances in lattice QCD and related nonperturbative methods. The relativistic Fermi gas model is used to convert the nucleon-level momentum transfer to the nuclear level, thereby incorporating nuclear effects pertinent to heavy target experiments. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we present ultraviolet-complete examples featuring spin-1 and spin-2 portal dark matter.

Three alternative models (i.e. dissipative photosphere, internal shock, and ICMART) have been proposed to interpret the observations of GRB prompt emission, but none of them can fully interpret all of the observational data collected so far. The question is that what is the fraction of these three theoretical models in the prompt emission of GRB, respectively. In this paper, we propose to utilize an innovative method, and constrain the fraction of GRB prompt emission models via its non-detected diffuse neutrinos.

Two of the main consequences of such an interaction are the emergence of an additional force and the non-conservation of the energy--momentum tensor, which can be interpreted as an energy exchange between matter and geometry. By adopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different approaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced particle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible thermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar--tensor formulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle creation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that irreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration through a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds: the total entropy, from both the apparent horizon and enclosed matter, increases monotonically and saturates in the de Sitter phase, imposing constraints on the allowed particle production dynamics.

We find evidence that such couplings vanish in asymptotically safe gravity and are also not generated in a perturbative quantum-gravity regime that describes quantum gravity as an effective field theory.\n\n", "2510.23768": "2025-10-27, **Galactic Alchemy: Deep Learning Map-to-Map Translation in Hydrodynamical Simulations**, Philipp Denzel et.al., [2510.23768v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23768v1)\n\n We present the first systematic study of multi-domain map-to-map translation in galaxy formation simulations, leveraging deep generative models to predict diverse galactic properties. Using high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical simulation data, we compare conditional generative adversarial networks and diffusion models under unified preprocessing and evaluation, optimizing architectures and attention mechanisms for physical fidelity on galactic scales. Our approach jointly addresses seven astrophysical domains - including dark matter, gas, neutral hydrogen, stellar mass, temperature, and magnetic field strength - while introducing physics-aware evaluation metrics that quantify structural realism beyond standard computer vision measures. We demonstrate that translation difficulty correlates with physical coupling, achieving near-perfect fidelity for mappings from gas to dark matter and mappings involving astro-chemical components such as total gas to HI content, while identifying fundamental challenges in weakly constrained tasks such as gas to stellar mass mappings.

Analytic models to describe this evolution have been developed and calibrated to numerical simulations initialized with isotropic particle velocity distributions, an assumption not necessarily warranted by the theory of halo formation. Here we study the dependence of the timescale for gravothermal collapse on the velocity distribution. To do so, we consider self-consistent initial conditions for halos with the same density distribution but with different velocity distributions. We consider models with constant anisotropy and with an anisotropy that increases with radius. The velocity distributions that we explore have collapse times that differ from that assuming isotropic distributions by more than a factor of two. We argue that these variations may depend on the global changes in velocity-dispersion profiles in these anisotropic models and not just on the degree of anisotropy.\n\n", "2510.23696": "2025-10-27, **Sub-GeV dark matter and multi-decay signatures from dark showers at beam-dump experiments**, Elias Bernreuther et.al., [2510.23696v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23696v1)\n\n In models of strongly-interacting dark sectors, the production of dark quarks at accelerators can give rise to dark showers with multiple dark mesons in the final state. If some of these dark mesons are sufficiently light and long-lived, they can be detected with searches for displaced vertices at beam-dump experiments and electron-positron colliders. In this work we focus on the case that dark quark production proceeds via effective operators, while the dark sector analogue of the $\\rho^0$ meson can decay via kinetic mixing. We evaluate current constraints from NA62 and BaBar as well as sensitivity projections for SHiP and Belle II. We find that there exists a sizable parameter region where SHiP may detect several displaced vertices in a single event and thus obtain valuable information about the structure of the dark sector.\n\n", "2510.23549": "2025-10-27, **Cosmic Vine: High abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster at z=3.44**, Nikolaj B.

Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M*/Msun)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z>3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M*/Msun) > 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)>10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/Msun)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/Msun)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core.

(2013) by further analyzing the influence of dynamical friction on the evolution of cosmological perturbations within the framework of the spherical collapse model (SCM) in a Universe dominated by generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG). Specifically, we investigate how dynamical friction alters the growth rate of density perturbations, the effective sound speed, the equation-of-state parameter www, and the evolution of the cosmic expansion rate. Our results demonstrate that dynamical friction significantly delays the collapse process compared to the standard SCM. Accurate computation of these parameters is crucial for obtaining consistent results and reliable physical interpretations when employing the GCG model. Furthermore, our analysis confirms that the suppression of perturbation growth due to dynamical friction is considerably more pronounced than that caused by shear and rotation, as previously indicated by Del Popolo et al.

This enhanced suppression effectively addresses the instability issues, such as oscillations or exponential divergences in the dark-matter power spectrum, highlighted in linear perturbation studies, such as those by Sandvik et al.

We investigate whether the elongation of galaxy clusters correlates with the orientation of surrounding filaments, providing the first observational test of this relationship in large supercluster regions. We identified and characterized cosmic filaments in two dimensions within the two superclusters that are part of the low-redshift sub-survey of the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES): the Shapley supercluster and the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster. We analyzed the alignment between filament directions -- traced by galaxy distributions -- and the triaxiality of cluster gravitational potentials -- traced by X-ray emission- using publicly available optical and X-ray data. We have found that most (82%) of the X-ray clusters are associated with and interconnected by the optically detected filaments. The clusters-filaments alignment analysis shows that the elongation of most clusters is well aligned with nearby filaments, providing observational confirmation of theoretical predictions, with the alignment progressively reducing at larger cluster-centric distances ($> 1.6 r\\_{200}$). Overall, our results support the notion that filaments are the main source of galaxy accretion at redshift below 0.1 and additionally provide evidence that matter accretion through filaments shapes the gravitational potential of galaxy clusters.

The CYGNO Experiment aims to exploit an innovative approach applied to the direct detection search of low energy nuclear recoils possibly induced by cold particle-like dark matter candidates.

Given the low radioactivity requirements, especially in internal components such as field cage and cathode, the reduction of material while keeping the correct electrical behavior is paramount. In this paper, we present the validation of several internal components, mainly focusing on the field cage material and support structure.

The forecasting method relies solely on the instrument response functions (IRFs) to predict ULs for a given observational setup, without the need for full analysis pipelines.

We demonstrate its utility across a range of canonical annihilation channels, including $b\\bar{b}$, $W^+W^-$, $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$, and apply it to several major gamma-ray experiments, including MAGIC, \\textit{Fermi}-LAT, and CTAO. Notably, we develop a recasting approach that remains effective even when the IRF is unavailable by extracting generalized IRF-dependent coefficients from benchmark channels. We apply this method to reinterpret ULs derived from standard spectra (e.g., PPPC4DMID) in terms of more recent DM scenarios, including a Higgsino-like model with mixed final states and spectra generated with the CosmiXs model. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and direct comparison with published results confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method, with discrepancies remaining within statistical uncertainties.

Numerous experiments have probed a variety of dark matter candidates using diverse detector technologies, yet large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. In this work, we present a novel high-statistics search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $\\gamma$ cascades, employing approximately 100~kg of CsI(Tl) scintillators at Texas A\\&M University. The key feature of this experiment is the use of a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source combined with a \"missing gamma\" technique, in which the absence of a photon in a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance--disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, thereby enabling sensitivity to weaker couplings. With approximately 1000~hours of data collected using the current setup, no statistically significant excess was observed, consistent with existing constraints on dark-sector candidates such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), dark scalars, and dark photons in the sub-MeV mass range.

We demonstrate that during the first five days, the luminosity and color evolution of AT2025ulz are consistent with both kilonova and shock cooling models, although a Bayesian model comparison shows preference for the shock cooling model, underscoring the ambiguity inherent to early data obtained over only a few days. Continued monitoring beyond this window reveals a rise and color evolution incompatible with kilonova models and instead consistent with a supernova.

We generally confirm the earlier metallicity estimates and reveal four EMP ([Fe/H] $< -3$) stars in the current sample.

This filament, characterized by the highest particle acceleration rate among Cas A's outer shells, offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate underlying astrophysical mechanisms. Since 2000, the non-thermal flux has increased by several tens of percent before plateauing, while the spectral shape has remained largely unchanged. Over the past two decades, the filament's morphology has evolved significantly, splitting into two distinct sections. Detailed analysis reveals contrasting behaviors: one section shows a flux increase followed by saturation, while the other maintains a steady flux. These differences likely arise from nonlinear effects, including magnetohydrodynamic interactions influenced by magnetic field orientation, interactions with surrounding material, and complex fluid dynamics associated with young supernova remnants.

The extended AP test method uses the full shape of redshift-space two-point correlation funcion(CF) as the standard shape in order to measure the expansion history of the universe. We calibrate the standard shape by using the cosmology-dependent nonlinear evolution of the CF shape in the Multiverse simulations.

We characterise the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum of the pulsar and model the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the PWN using radio, X-ray, and GeV data. The emission is well described by a single electron population with two spectral breaks: one intrinsic to the injection spectrum and another produced by synchrotron cooling in a magnetic field of $\\sim$15~$\\mu$G. Notably, the inferred magnetic field and the low TeV flux of the nebula resemble those of 3C~58, suggesting that similar low-field environments can arise in young PWNe.

The first week of follow-up suggested properties reminiscent of a GW170817-like kilonova. Subsequent follow-up suggests properties most similar to a young, stripped-envelope, Type IIb supernova. Although we cannot statistically rule out chance coincidence, we undertake due diligence analysis to explore the possible association between ZTF25abjmnps and S250818k.

We quickly initiated a set of observations with \\textit{Swift}, \\textit{XMM-Newton}, \\textit{Chandra}, and the Very Large Array to search for non-thermal afterglow emission. Our deep X-ray and radio search rules out that the optical rebrightening of AT2025ulz is related to the afterglow onset, reinforcing its classification as a stripped-envelope supernova (SN 2025ulz).

High internal fields can significantly deform a WD's equilibrium structure, generating a quadrupole moment. If the rotation axis is misaligned with the magnetic axis, the deformation can lead to the emission of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We examine the potential for detecting CGWs from magnetized WDs with future space-based detectors such as LISA, ALIA, DECIGO, Deci-Hz, BBO and TianQin. We model the field-induced deformation and compute the resulting GW strain, incorporating amplitude decay due to angular momentum loss from electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. This sets a timescale for detection -`active timescale' of $10^{5-6}$ yr, requiring observation while the object remains sufficiently young. Our results suggest that LISA could detect a few dozens of highly magnetized WDs across the Galaxy during its mission.

From the DESI spectrum, we obtain a secure redshift of $z = 0.084840 \\pm 0.000006$, which places the transient within $2\\sigma$ of the gravitational wave distance and results in an integral overlap between the gravitational wave alert and the transient location of $\\log\\_{10}\\mathcal{I} \\approx 3.9-4.2$.

These results emphasize the value of DESI's extensive spectroscopic dataset in rapidly characterizing host galaxies, enabling spectroscopic host subtraction, and guiding targeted follow-up.\n\n", "2510.23548": "2025-10-27, **The MandelZoom project II: the impact of stellar feedback on black hole accretion through an $\u03b1$-disc in dwarf galaxies with a resolved interstellar medium**, Eun-jin Shin et.al., [2510.23548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23548v1)\n\n We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different stellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We employ a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius of the $\\alpha$-accretion disc ($<0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the self-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of stellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively, producing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included, fragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding the IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the ISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both radiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent: it survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being replenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes place. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling the combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH growth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with IMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy models explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with future observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA, and make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift supermassive BHs observed by JWST.\n\n", "2510.23533": "2025-10-27, **Discovery of SN 2025wny: a Strongly Gravitationally Lensed Superluminous Supernova at z = 2.01**, Joel Johansson et.al., [2510.23533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23533v1)\n\n We present the discovery of SN 2025wny (ZTF25abnjznp/GOTO25gtq) and spectroscopic classification of this event as the first gravitationally lensed Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I). Deep ground-based follow-up observations resolves four images of the supernova with ~1.7\" angular separation from the main lens galaxy, each coincident with the lensed images of a background galaxy seen in archival imaging of the field. Spectroscopy of the brightest point image shows narrow features matching absorption lines at a redshift of z = 2.011 and broad features matching those seen in superluminous SNe with Far-UV coverage. We infer a magnification factor of 20 to 50 for the brightest image in the system, based on photometric and spectroscopic comparisons to other SLSNe-I. SN 2025wny demonstrates that gravitationally-lensed SNe are in reach of ground-based facilities out to redshifts far higher than what has been previously assumed, and provide a unique window into studying distant supernovae, internal properties of dwarf galaxies, as well as for time-delay cosmography.\n\n", "2510.23330": "2025-10-27, **The First Star-by-star $N$-body/Hydrodynamics Simulation of Our Galaxy Coupling with a Surrogate Model**, Keiya Hirashima et.al., [2510.23330v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23330v1)\n\n A major goal of computational astrophysics is to simulate the Milky Way Galaxy with sufficient resolution down to individual stars. However, the scaling fails due to some small-scale, short-timescale phenomena, such as supernova explosions. We have developed a novel integration scheme of $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.\n\n", "2510.23126": "2025-10-27, **A volcanic chronosequence as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to study the cosmic-ray flux in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene**, Claudio Galelli et.al., [2510.23126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23126v1)\n\n We present a phenomenological study demonstrating the feasibility of using olivine xenoliths from the Cha\\^ine des Puys as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to probe the cosmic-ray flux over the last 40,000 years. This volcanic region provides a unique chronosequence of samples brought to the surface by well-dated eruptions. By modeling the expected density of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic-ray muons in olivine, we show that the signal is detectable and above backgrounds from natural radioactivity. We demonstrate that by analyzing samples with different exposure ages, it is possible to construct a time-differential measurement of the cosmic-ray flux. This method shows sensitivity to historical variations, such as the enhanced flux expected during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion ($\\sim$41~kyr) and the potential contribution from nearby supernovae, for which we use the Antlia supernova remnant precursor as a benchmark.

This approach allows us to constrain cosmographic parameters and test CDDR at a particular redshift. Further, it does not rely on data reconstructions or extrapolations of the cosmographic parameters to higher redshifts. We employ observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Baryon Acoustic Oscillation dataset, cosmic chronometers, and Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon Plus and Dark Energy Survey Year 5 compilations.

We modeled the first peak with a semianalytical shock-cooling model and the X-ray emission with a free-free model. We compare the envelope radius and mass-loss rate with other Type IIb SNe to explore the relationships between the progenitor envelope and the circumstellar material (CSM). The shock-cooling peak in the $V$-band light curve reached $M\\_V = -17.33\\pm 0.26$mag, while the $^{56}$Ni-powered second peak attained $M\\_V = -17.43\\pm 0.26$mag.

SN 2024iss occupies a transitional position between the two subclasses of extended (eIIb) and compact (cIIb) Type IIb SNe. Its envelope radius and pre-explosion mass-loss rate appear to be correlated as theoretically predicted. The observational properties of SN 2024iss are compatible with a binary interaction scenario being the dominant mechanism for envelope stripping. Furthermore, the low column density of neutral hydrogen suggests a compact CSM with an outer radius of $\\lesssim1.3\\times10^{14}$ cm, indicating that the progenitor star experienced eruptive mass loss within $\\sim4\\,yr$ of its terminal explosion.\n\n", "2510.22989": "2025-10-27, **SN2017ckj: A linearly declining Type IIb supernova with a relatively massive hydrogen envelope**, L. -H.

Its early-time multi-band light curves display no clear evidence of a shock-cooling tail, resembling the behavior of SN2008ax. The $V$-band light curve exhibits a short rise time of about 5 days and reaches an absolute peak magnitude of $M\\_{\\rm V}=-18.58\\pm0.17\\mathrm{mag}$. The late-time multi-band light curves reveal a linear decline. We modelled the bolometric light curve of SN2017ckj to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters.

Both the $\\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass and the envelope mass of SN2017ckj are higher than those of typical SNe IIb, in agreement with its peculiar light curve evolution. The early-time spectra of SN2017ckj are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow $\\rm H\\_\\alpha$ and \\Heii emission lines. The earliest spectrum exhibits flash ionization features, from which we estimated a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\\sim 3.4\\times10^{-4}M\\_\\odot \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.
