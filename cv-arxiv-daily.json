In a previous work, it was shown that these two episodes of neutrino emission could be due to an inspiral of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) close to its merger at the core of TXS 0506+056. Such an inspiral can lead to quasi-periodic particle emission due to jet precession close to the final coalescence. This model made predictions on when the next neutrino emission episode must occur. On September 18, 2022, IceCube detected an additional, $\\sim 170$ TeV neutrino in directional coincidence with the blazar TXS 0506+056, being consistent with the model prediction. Additionally, in April 2021, the Baikal Collaboration reported the detection of a $224\\pm 75$ TeV neutrino, with TXS 0506+056 being in the uncertainty range of the event direction. We show that these four distinct flares of neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 are consistent with a precessing jet scenario, driven by an inspiraling SMBBH. Using improved modeling, we are now able to constrain the total mass together with the mass ratio for the binary. We predict when the next neutrino flares from TXS 0506+056 should be happening. Finally, we estimate the detection potential of the Laser-interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) for the merger in the future.\n\n", "2310.02112": "2023-10-03, **Real-time Signal Detection for Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy Measurements using Antenna Arrays**, A. Ashtari Esfahani et.al., [2310.02112v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02112v1)\n\n Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES) is a technique for precision measurement of the energies of charged particles, which is being developed by the Project 8 Collaboration to measure the neutrino mass using tritium beta-decay spectroscopy. Project 8 seeks to use the CRES technique to measure the neutrino mass with a sensitivity of 40~meV, requiring a large supply of tritium atoms stored in a multi-cubic meter detector volume. Antenna arrays are one potential technology compatible with an experiment of this scale, but the capability of an antenna-based CRES experiment to measure the neutrino mass depends on the efficiency of the signal detection algorithms. In this paper, we develop efficiency models for three signal detection algorithms and compare them using simulations from a prototype antenna-based CRES experiment as a case-study. The algorithms include a power threshold, a matched filter template bank, and a neural network based machine learning approach, which are analyzed in terms of their average detection efficiency and relative computational cost. It is found that significant improvements in detection efficiency and, therefore, neutrino mass sensitivity are achievable, with only a moderate increase in computation cost, by utilizing either the matched filter or machine learning approach in place of a power threshold, which is the baseline signal detection algorithm used in previous CRES experiments by Project 8.\n\n", "2310.02085": "2023-10-03, **Fermilab Main Injector and Recycler Operations in the Megawatt Era**, A.

For the quasi-elastic channel, dominated by one particle-one hole excitations, an overview over several nuclear models - specifically Relativistic Fermi Gas, SuperScaling Approach, Spectral Function, Hartree-Fock and Random Phase Approximation - is presented and compared with data for electron-nucleus scattering, a very important process for testing theoretical models validity, highlighting the specific features of each approach.

In particular, as a matter component, massive neutrino affects the formation of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe, and conversely, observations of the LSS can give constraints on the neutrino mass. Performing large numerical simulations of the LSS formation including massive neutrino along with conventional cold dark matter is thus an important task. For this, calculating the neutrino distribution in the phase space by solving the Vlasov equation is a more suitable approach than conventional $N$-body simulations, but it requires solving the PDE in the $(6+1)$-dimensional space and is thus computationally demanding: configuring $n\\_\\mathrm{gr}$ grid points in each coordinate and $n\\_t$ time grid points leads to $O(n\\_tn\\_\\mathrm{gr}^6)$ complexity. We propose an efficient quantum algorithm for this task. Linearizing the Vlasov equation by neglecting the relatively weak self-gravity of the neutrino, we perform the Hamiltonian simulation to produce quantum states that encode the phase space distribution of neutrino.

The statistical analysis usually proceeds from a standard method, a single dimensional estimator $(1D-\\Delta \\chi^{2})$ that shows some draw-backs and concerns, together with a debatable strategy. The draw-backs and considerations of the standard method will be explianed through the following three main issues. First issue is the limited power of the standard method. The $\\Delta \\chi^{2}$ estimator provides us with different results when different simulation procedures were used. Second issue, when $\\chi^{2}\\_{min(NH)}$ and $\\chi^{2}\\_{min(IH)}$ are drawn in a $2D$ map, their strong positive correlation manifests $\\chi^{2}$ as a bi-dimensional instead of single dimensional estimator. The overlapping between the $\\chi^{2}$ distributions of the two hypotheses leads to the experiment sensitivity reduction. Third issue is the robustness of the standard method. When the JUNO sensitivity is obtained using different procedures, $\\Delta \\chi^{2}$ as one dimensional and $\\chi^{2}$ as two dimensional estimator, the experimental sensitivity varies with the different values of the atmospheric mass, the input parameter. We computed the oscillation of $\\vert\\overline{\\Delta \\chi^{2}} \\vert$ with the input parameter values, $\\vert\\Delta m^{2} \\vert\\_{input}$. The MH significance using the standard method, $\\Delta\\chi^{2}$, strongly depends on the values of the parameter $\\vert\\Delta m^{2} \\vert\\_{input}$.

For the inflationary potentials, we consider two different formulations in gravity that are non-minimally coupled to the scalar field of the inflaton: \\textit{Metric and Palatini.} We only consider the self-interaction to be present among $\\tau$-neutrinos and only at moderate strengths. This is because strong interactions among $\\tau$-neutrinos, or any strength self-interaction among electron- and muon-neutrinos, as well as any strength flavor-universal interactions, are strongly disfavoured from particle physics experiments.   In terms of cosmological data, we use the latest public CMB datasets from Planck and BICEP/Keck collaborations, along with other data from CMB lensing, BAO, RSD, and SNe Ia luminosity distance measurements.

First studies of QED in-medium lepton dynamics have set a theoretical framework to derive electron-nucleus and (anti)neutrino-nucleus cross-section corrections. We employ this approach to quantitatively compute the effects of Glauber photon-mediated multiple re-scattering within the nuclear medium. We find that the relativistic charged lepton acquires momentum of order $10~\\mathrm{MeV}$ transverse to its direction of propagation inside the nucleus. This broadening sizably deflects expected electron tracks and suppresses scattering cross sections. Precise extraction of the nucleon and nuclear structure by electron and muon probes should, thus, take the QED nuclear medium angular redistribution of particles into account.

Detecting these neutrinos from sources outside the Milky Way is very difficult due to the small neutrino-nucleon cross section at MeV. Nevertheless, the non-observation of MeV neutrinos from high-energy transients may provide useful constraints on related neutrino production mechanisms where significant MeV production is expected. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a cubic kilometer neutrino detector operating with nearly 100% uptime at the South Pole, is sensitive to bursts of MeV neutrinos from astrophysical sources in and beyond the Milky Way.

Most of the gravitational wave events currently detected are due to the merger of binary black hole systems. One way to better investigate such systems is to look for coincident emission in electromagnetic waves or neutrinos. For typical models of isolated binaries, no such emission is expected. However, one promising class of mergers is that of binary black holes in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei. Such mergers potentially occur at high rates, since these environments naturally have high numbers of black holes, which can efficiently form binaries, merge rapidly, and potentially accrete matter fast due to the surrounding gas.

The two most widely discussed possibilities are a population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and annihilation of dark matter particles. In contrast with annihilating dark matter, MSPs are expected to produce periodic emission. We show that even though the number of photons contributing to the excess is small, there is potentially sufficient information in the data from Fermi to detect a periodic MSP signal. Such a detection would definitively prove that at least some fraction of the excess is due to MSPs.

By projecting each item in the integrand onto vector spaces spanned by simple basis functions, a multidimensional numerical integral is replaced by a much easier exercise in matrix multiplication. This method can be generalized to any integrand that depends linearly on multiple input functions. In this paper I apply the method to dark matter (DM) direct detection with anisotropic target materials, where the DM scattering rate depends not only on the DM particle model, the astrophysical DM velocity distribution, and the properties of the target material, but now also on the $SO(3)$ orientation of the detector. The vector space calculation factorizes the astrophysics, the DM particle model, and the SM material properties from each other, while describing detector rotations by simple matrix multiplication acting on the basis functions.

In this work I introduce a complete, orthogonal basis of spherical wavelet-harmonic functions, designed for the new vector space integration method. This factorizes the numeric calculation into a part that depends only on the astrophysical velocity distribution; a second part, depending only on the detector form factor; and a scattering matrix defined on the basis functions, which depends on the details of the dark matter (DM) particle model (e.g. its mass). For common spin-independent DM-Standard Model interactions, this scattering matrix can be evaluated analytically in the wavelet-harmonic basis. This factorization is particularly helpful for the more complicated analyses that have become necessary in recent years, especially those involving anisotropic detector materials or more realistic models of the local DM velocity distribution. With the new method, analyses studying large numbers of detector orientations and DM particle models can be performed about 10 million times faster.   This paper derives several analytic results for the spherical wavelets, including an extrapolation in the space of wavelet coefficients, and a generalization of the vector space method to a much broader class of linear functional integrals.

The Einstein/Newtonian plus cold or warm dark-matter-based models face many significant but unresolved tensions (e.g. planes of satellites, the highly organised and symmetrical structure of the Local Group, the local Gpc-scale void). The accumulating nature of these indicates quite compellingly the need for a different theoretical framework. An example is the prediction, made in 1997, of the existence of satellite galaxies with near-exact properties to the Hercules dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxy discovered in 2007 if it is a tidal dwarf galaxy void of dark matter. Such results indicate that once the evidence is accepted that dark matter particles have no role in galaxies with gravitation being effectively Milgromian, then the resulting theoretical understanding of galaxies becomes much simpler and highly predictive with remarkable successes. Along with these scientific advancements, the recent observational data solidify the existence of one of the most important relations in star-formation theory, namely the mmax-Mecl relation. The data rule out stochastic star formation and confirm that the IMF becomes increasingly top-heavy with increasing star-formation rate density. Galaxies and their embedded-star-cluster building blocks are therefore self-regulated dynamical systems which are computationally accessible.

Panda et.al., [2310.01344v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01344v1)\n\n Despite being the dominant force of nature on large scales, gravity remains relatively elusive to experimental measurement. Many questions remain, such as its behavior at small scales or its role in phenomena ascribed to dark matter and dark energy. Atom interferometers are powerful tools for probing Earth's gravity, the gravitational constant, dark energy theories and general relativity. However, they typically use atoms in free fall, which limits the measurement time to only a few seconds, and to even briefer intervals when measuring the interaction of the atoms with a stationary source mass. Recently, interferometers with atoms suspended for as long as 70 seconds in an optical lattice have been demonstrated. To keep the atoms from falling, however, the optical lattice must apply forces that are billion-fold as strong as the putative signals, so even tiny imperfections reduce sensitivity and generate complex systematic effects. As a result, lattice interferometers have yet to demonstrate precision and accuracy on par with their free fall counterparts and have yet to be used for precision measurement. Here, we optimize the sensitivity of a lattice interferometer and use a system of signal inversions and switches to suppress and quantify systematic effects. This enables us to measure the attraction of a miniature source mass, ruling out the existence of screened dark energy theories over their natural parameter space. More importantly, the combined accuracy of $6.2~\\rm{nm/s}^2$ is four times as good as the best similar measurements with freely falling atoms, demonstrating the advantages of lattice interferometry in fundamental physics measurements.

We find, by using the sixth order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, that the longest-lived modes are the ones with higher angular number, for a scalar field mass smaller than a critical value, known as anomalous decay rate of the quasinormal modes, while that beyond this critical value the behaviour is inverted. Moreover, we show that it is possible to recover the real part of the quasinormal frequencies (QNFs), the imaginary part of the QNFs, and the critical scalar field mass, of the Schwarzschild background for different values of the PFDM intensity parameter $k$, respectively. For values of $k$ smaller than these values, the mentioned quantities are greater than the Schwarzschild background. However, beyond of these values of $k$, these quantities are smaller than the Schwarzschild background.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2310.02213": "2023-10-03, **Turbulent Structure In Supernova Remnants G46.8-0.3 And G39.2-0.3 From THOR Polarimetry**, Russell Shanahan et.al., [2310.02213v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02213v1)\n\n We present the continued analysis of polarization and Faraday rotation for the supernova remnants (SNRs) G46.8-0.3 and G39.2-0.3 in L-band (1-2 GHz) radio continuum in The HI/OH/Recombination line (THOR) survey.

CTAO will comprise over 67 telescopes of three different sizes, located in the northern and southern hemispheres. Among these, the Medium-Sized Telescope (MST) will play a crucial role in CTAO's observations, providing excellent sensitivity and angular resolution for gamma rays in the energy range of 100 GeV to 5 TeV. The MST is based on a modified single-mirror Davies-Cotton design, featuring a segmented mirror with a diameter of 12 meters, a total reflective surface of 88 square meters, and a focal length of 16 meters. It will cover an approximately 8-degree field of view and be equipped with two different cameras: NectarCAM and FlashCam, at the northern and southern CTAO sites, respectively. The MST's design is optimized for efficient observation of extended sources, including supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae, as well as the study of gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. Currently, the MST is in the midst of production and testing stages with the aim of being installed in 2025 for the CTAO Pathfinder project. In this project, one MST telescope will be deployed at each CTAO site to provide on-site experience with pre-production components. This approach facilitates cost and risk reduction before starting serial production.

We have conducted spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of the shock-cloud interacting region of RCW 86 with XMM-Newton. It is found that bright soft X-ray filaments surround the dense cloud observed with 12CO and HI emission lines. These filaments are brighter in thermal X-ray emission, and fainter and possibly softer in synchrotron X-rays, compared to those without interaction. Our results show that the shock decelerates due to the interaction with clouds, which results in an enhancements of thermal X-ray emission. This could possibly also explain the softer X-ray synchrotron component, because it implies that those shocks that move through a low density environment, and therefore decelerate much less, can be more efficient accelerators. This is similar to SN 1006 and Tycho, and is in contrast to RX J1713.7-3946. This difference among remnants may be due to the clumpiness of dense material interacting with the shock, which should be examined with future observations.\n\n", "2310.01531": "2023-10-02, **A comprehensive hydrodynamical study of SB DEM L50: understanding off-centre SNe and soft X-ray luminosity**, Rogelio Orozco-Duarte et.al., [2310.01531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01531v1)\n\n The superbubbles (SBs) carved in the interstellar medium by stellar winds and supernovae (SNe) are filled with hot ($T>$10$^{6}$~K) gas that produces soft X-ray emission (0.3-2.0\\,keV). Models that assume a constant density medium and central SNe events fail to reproduce the soft X-ray luminosity that is observed in some SBs. We address this problem by generating models that trace the history of SNe in the SB and that produce off-centre SNe, that account for the missing soft X-ray emission. We test the models against archival, radio, optical, and X-ray observations of the SB DEM\\,L50 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The soft X-ray properties of DEM L50, including its high luminosity, makes it a perfect candidate to test our models. Furthermore, the multiple wave-band observations of this object will help us to assess how well our models can reproduce other SB properties beside its soft X-ray properties. We find that a configuration where DEM L50 forms at the edge of a filament reproduces the observed soft X-ray luminosity, optical morphology, shell velocity, and swept-up mass of neutral gas. This configuration is supported by IR observations of the LMC. In addition, we find that off-centre SNe, which enhance soft X-ray emission, naturally occur for all of the initial ambient conditions we tested in our models. Finally, we show that an off-centre SN can explain the observed soft X-ray luminosity of DEM L50, and that the resulting luminosity is consistent with a plasma in non-equilibrium ionisation.\n\n", "2310.01514": "2023-10-02, **The search for failed supernovae with the Large BinocularTelescope: The Mid-IR Counterpart to N6946-BH1**, C.

The source is very faint in the HST near-IR observations (~10^3 Lsun) and is not optically variable to a limit of ~10^3 Lsun at R-band. The dust is likely silicate and probably has to be dominated by very large grains as predicted for dust formed in a failed SN.

Spectroscopy of light echoes can reveal details on the kinematics of the ejecta, probe asymmetry, and reveal details on its interaction with circumstellar matter, thus expanding our understanding of these transient events. However, the spectral features arise from a complex interplay between the source photons, the reflecting dust geometry, and the instrumental setup and observing conditions. In this work we present an improved method for modeling these effects in light echo spectra, one that relaxes the simplifying assumption of a light curve weighted sum, and instead estimates the true relative contribution of each phase. We discuss our logic, the gains we obtain over light echo analysis method(s) used in the past, and prospects for further improvements. Lastly, we show how the new method improves our analysis of echoes from Tycho's supernova (SN 1572) as an example.\n\n", "2310.01498": "2023-10-02, **Considering the Single and Binary Origins of the Type IIP SN 2017eaw**, K. Azalee Bostroem et.al., [2310.01498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01498v1)\n\n Current population synthesis modeling suggests that 30-50% of Type II supernovae originate from binary progenitors, however, the identification of a binary progenitor is challenging. One indicator of a binary progenitor is that the surrounding stellar population is too old to contain a massive single star.Measurements of the progenitor mass of SN 2017eaw are starkly divided between observations made temporally close to core-collapse which show a progenitor mass of 13-15 solar masses (final helium core mass of 4.4 to 6.0 solar masses - which is a more informative property than initial mass) and those from the stellar population surrounding the SN which find M<10.8 solar masses (helium core mass <3.4 solar masses). In this paper, we reanalyze the surrounding stellar population with improved astrometry and photometry, finding a median age of 16.8 (+3.2, -1.0) Myr for all stars younger than 50 Myr (helium core mass of 4.7 solar masses) and 85.9 (+3.2, -6.5) Myr for stars younger than 150 Myr. 16.8 Myr is now consistent with the helium core mass range derived from the temporally near explosion observations for single stars. Applying the combined constraints to population synthesis models, we determine that the probability of the progenitor of SN 2017eaw being an initially single-star is 65% compared to 35% for prior binary interaction. 85.9 Myr is inconsistent with any formation scenarios. We demonstrate that combining progenitor age constraints with helium core mass estimates from red supergiant SED modeling, late-time spectra, and indirectly from light curve modeling can help to differentiate single and binary progenitor scenarios and provide a framework for the application of this technique to future observations.\n\n", "2310.01482": "2023-10-02, **HI discs of L$_{\\ast}$ galaxies as probes of the baryonic physics of galaxy evolution**, Jindra Gensior et.al., [2310.01482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01482v1)\n\n Understanding what shapes the cold gas component of galaxies, which both provides the fuel for star formation and is strongly affected by the subsequent stellar feedback, is a crucial step towards a better understanding of galaxy evolution. Here, we analyse the HI properties of a sample of 46 Milky Way halo-mass galaxies, drawn from cosmological simulations (EMP-Pathfinder and FIREbox). This set of simulations comprises galaxies evolved self-consistently across cosmic time with different baryonic sub-grid physics: three different star formation models [constant star formation efficiency (SFE) with different star formation eligibility criteria, and an environmentally-dependent, turbulence-based SFE] and two different feedback prescriptions, where only one sub-sample includes early stellar feedback. We use these simulations to assess the impact of different baryonic physics on the HI content of galaxies. We find that the galaxy-wide HI properties agree with each other and with observations. However, differences appear for small-scale properties. The thin HI discs observed in the local Universe are only reproduced with a turbulence-dependent SFE and/or early stellar feedback. Furthermore, we find that the morphology of HI discs is particularly sensitive to the different physics models: galaxies simulated with a turbulence-based SFE have discs that are smoother and more rotationally symmetric, compared to those simulated with a constant SFE; galaxies simulated with early stellar feedback have more regular discs than supernova-feedback-only galaxies. We find that the rotational asymmetry of the HI discs depends most strongly on the underlying physics model, making this a promising observable for understanding the physics responsible for shaping the interstellar medium of galaxies.\n\n", "2310.01293": "2023-10-02, **Modelling the AM CVn and Double Detonation Supernova Progenitor Binary System CD-30$^{\\circ}$11223**, Kunal Deshmukh et.al., [2310.01293v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01293v1)\n\n We present a detailed modelling study of CD-30$^{\\circ}$11223 (CD-30), a hot subdwarf (sdB)-white dwarf (WD) binary identified as a double detonation supernova progenitor, using the open-source stellar evolution software MESA. We focus on implementing binary evolution models carefully tuned to match the observed characteristics of the system including $\\log g$ and $T\\_{\\rm eff}$.

The best explanation for that emission is a hadronic interaction between cosmic rays (CRs) and ambient gas, where a CR central and continuous source accelerates protons up to 1 PeV (\"PeVatron\"). However, current models assume very simplistic CR dynamics. Our goal is to verify if more realistic CR dynamics for the GC environment are consistent with current gamma-ray observations, and whether they could be constrained by upcoming observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). We generated synthetic gamma-ray maps using a CR transport model with spherical injection, different diffusion regimes (in and out of the CMZ), polar advection, and mono-energetic particles of 1 PeV, and including different CR populations injected from the Arches, Quintuplet, and nuclear clusters of young massive stars, plus supernova Sgr A East. We adopted two different 3D gas distributions consistent with the observed gas column density, either with or without an inner cavity. In order to reproduce the existing observations detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS), a ring-like gas distribution, with its mass set by the standard Galactic CO-to-H$\\_2$ conversion factor, and CR acceleration from all relevant sources are required. For a conversion factor one order of magnitude lower, injection rates that are ten times higher are needed. We show that CTA will be able to differentiate between models with different CR dynamics, proton sources, and CMZ morphology, owing to its unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. More realistic CR dynamics suggest that the CMZ has a large inner cavity and that the GC PeVatron is a composite CR population accelerated by the Arches, Quintuplet, and nuclear star clusters, and Sgr A East.\n\n"}}
