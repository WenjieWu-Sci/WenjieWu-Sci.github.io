The most significant individual neutrino source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 at 4.2$\\sigma$ level with a soft spectral index. Another notable candidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a potential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this source returned a very hard spectral index of ~ 1.9 and the excess is dominated by two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and IC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV, implying a maximum proton energy > 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC 1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino spectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT observations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade flux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV flux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the neutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons are accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the corona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and X-rays from the corona through the $p\\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with energy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required maximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to unity ($\\sigma\\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization parameter with $\\sigma\\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated composition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino spectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different magnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN.\n\n", "2510.19647": "2025-10-22, **The Impact of Population III.1 Flash Reionization for CMB Polarization and Thomson Scattering Optical Depth**, Jonathan C. Tan et.al., [2510.19647v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19647v1)\n\n The Population III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts a very early ($z\\sim20-25$), transient phase, ``The Flash'', of cosmic reionization powered by supermassive stars that are SMBH progenitors. The universe then quickly recombined to become mostly neutral, with this state persisting until galaxies begin to reionize intergalactic gas again at $z\\sim 10$. The overall Thomson scattering optical depth, $\\tau$, from The Flash has been shown to be $\\tau\\_{\\rm PopIII.1}\\sim0.03$, leading to a total $\\tau\\sim0.08-0.09$. Such a value, while significantly larger than that previously inferred from {\\it Planck} observations of the low-$l$ $EE$ polarization power spectrum of the CMB, can help relieve several ``tensions'' faced by the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, especially the preference for negative neutrino masses and dynamic dark energy. Here we compute $EE$ power spectra of example models of The Flash. We find that, because of its very high redshift, the contribution to $l\\lesssim8$ modes is dramatically reduced compared to usual low-$z$ reionization models for the same value of $\\tau$, while the power at $l\\gtrsim8$ is boosted.

MNR is one of the most interesting mechanisms by which neutrino flavor evolution can occur in dense astrophysical environments. Previous studies have typically assumed that the neutrino flavor field evolves to a steady state -- a simplification also used in other self-interaction models such as the neutrino-bulb model. Here, we perform reproducible calculations of MNR using both time-independent and time-dependent formalisms and show that they yield qualitatively different flavor survival probabilities. The time-independent approach produces unstable steady-state solutions that differ fundamentally from the dynamical behavior captured in time-dependent simulations. These results demonstrate that the steady-state assumption is generally invalid, and physical interpretations based on time-independent calculations of dense neutrino systems require re-evaluation.\n\n", "2510.19168": "2025-10-22, **Transfer Learning Beyond the Standard Model**, Veena Krishnaraj et.al., [2510.19168v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19168v1)\n\n Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models.

However, we also show that negative transfer can occur when strong physical degeneracies exist between $\\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM parameters. We consider various transfer architectures, finding that including bottleneck structures provides the best performance.

When the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model is extended with right-handed neutrino superfields and the seesaw scale is very low, right-handed sneutrinos can be produced via the freeze-in mechanism. In such a case we can have essentially two independent sources for dark matter, the traditional freeze-out of higgsinos and the freeze-in of right-handed sneutrinos. The heavier of these two will decay to the lighter species with a delay.

Building directly on the original formulation, our approach naturally accommodates additional degrees of freedom and provides a unified, minimal framework for parametrising the Yukawa sector. It significantly simplifies both analytical treatments and numerical scans, and can be universally applied to any Majorana neutrino mass model, regardless of the underlying dynamics. The approach also offers a unified framework for classifying neutrino mass models according to the structure of the neutrino mass matrix, which naturally motivates the proposal of an extended version of the Scotogenic Model. This classification scheme yields tree-level (loop-level) representative models: the seesaw (Scotogenic Model), the linear seesaw (the Generalised Scotogenic Model), and the linear plus inverse seesaw (the Extended Scotogenic Model).

This is possible in the kinematic regions where the di-neutrino invariant mass squared, $q^2$, can be identified with the assumed $m\\_a^2$. While $q^2$ is reconstructed only in the Hadronic Tag Analysis (HTA), it is not directly accessible in the Inclusive Tag Analysis (ITA), which provides much larger statistics and hence higher sensitivity. In ITA, $q^2$ is proxied by a reconstructed variable, $q^2\\_{\\text{rec}}$, usually modeled through Belle II simulations. We show that the mapping between $q^2$ and $q^2\\_{\\text{rec}}$ can be accurately derived from kinematic arguments alone -- without relying on internal experimental inputs.

Importantly, our simulations model the impact of both the massive Standard Model neutrinos and LiMRs, which will be crucial in disentangling possible degeneracies. We systematically explore the effects of LiMR properties such as mass, temperature, and initial distribution, on various cosmological observables, including the total matter power spectrum, Halo Mass Functions (HMF), Mass-Concentration relation, radial halo profiles, and weak lensing signals around massive clusters.

We find dissipative effects become especially significant at wavenumber $k \\sim k\\_{\\mathcal{H},\\mathrm{dec}}$, where $k\\_{\\mathcal{H},\\mathrm{dec}}$ corresponds to the horizon scale at the decoupling of weakly-interacting particles.

Within the Standard Model of particle physics, dissipative effects caused by neutrinos at the nanohertz frequencies can be important in the analysis of pulsar timing array data. Furthermore, dissipation-induced features associated with possible new weakly-interacting particles can be detectable by a wide range of gravitational-wave experiments, serving as a promising probe of new physics at extremely high energy scales. As an extension, we also discuss dissipative effects in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity and their impacts on the anisotropies of IGWs and the poltergeist mechanism.

In this work, we investigate the dynamics of light dark matter, modeled as a minimally coupled scalar field, surrounding a binary neutron star system. Our primary focus is to assess whether the scalar field remains bound to the binary over the late inspiral-merger timescales and to determine its potential impact on observable signatures. We find that, in a range of scenarios, the scalar field forms a common cloud around the binary that does not disperse. At sufficiently high densities, this leads to measurable effects, including a dephasing of the binary inspiral, a less compact post-merger remnant, and suppression of the dynamical ejecta.

Despite extensive efforts, only the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, using NaI(Tl) detectors at Gran Sasso National Laboratory, has reported a positive dark matter signal. To independently verify this result, using the same NaI target is essential. This is the goal of ANAIS-112, operating with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators since 2017 at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). This thesis presents work within ANAIS-112, focusing on data analysis and the development of Geant4-based simulations to reduce systematics and increase sensitivity. Efforts have focused on understanding the ANAIS-112 crystals' response to nuclear recoils. Systematic uncertainties related to the scintillation quenching factors (QFs) of sodium and iodine recoiling in NaI(Tl) must be addressed to ensure reliable comparisons with DAMA/LIBRA and other experiments. For that purpose, onsite neutron calibrations in ANAIS-112 have been performed since 2021 at LSC using 252Cf sources. This work has compared calibration data with Geant4-based neutron simulations, which has revealed Geant4 deficiencies in certain decay processes and cross sections in some versions.

We also discuss some impacts of the broad distribution on cosmology and astrophysics. In the B ball (Q being the baryon number) case, the broad distribution would lead to the coexistence of both stable and unstable B balls. We find that stable B balls can account for the dark matter of the universe without affecting successful big bang nucleosynthesis by the decay of the unstable B balls, but the baryon number of the universe cannot be explained by them.

We present a new method to distinguish binary black hole formation channels using their spatial clustering at cosmological scales. Employing the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation Illustris, we trace the distribution of mergers across cosmic time and compare them with the underlying matter distribution associated with three candidate origins: isolated binary stellar evolution, binaries embedded in AGN disks, and primordial black holes within dark matter halos. For mergers at redshift $z \\lesssim 0.5$, these channels show distinct clustering signatures that could be accessible with proposed upgrades to current ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.

In this work, we statistically compare different fermionic DM configurations aimed to fit the astrometric data of S2, and five G-sources, and compare with the BH potential when appropriate. We sample the parameter spaces via Markov Chain Monte Carlo statistics and perform a quantitative comparison estimating Bayes factors for models that share the same likelihood function.

We demonstrate on the simulation suite Illustris-TNG that a steerable equivariant convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to infer the dark matter profiles within and around individual galaxies from photometric and interferometric data, improving on a standard CNN. Within the in silico environment of the simulations, our architecture is able to capture the dark matter distribution within galaxies without a parametrization of the profile.

However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter (DM).

We consider here the scientific requirements and present a concept for a dedicated astrometric instrument on HWO. It is capable to produce diffraction-limited images of large fields, achieving a point-spread function (PSF) precision of 20 milliarcseconds. Equipped with a detector calibration system, HWO can perform high precision astrometry, and, detect and measure the orbit of Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of Nearby Solar-type stars. HWO can dramatically improve current constraints on the self- interaction cross-section of heavy dark matter particles (WIMPs) and on the masses of ultra-high dark matter particles, through the study of stellar motions in galactic environments.

Current models for this interaction assume the shock expands into a smooth stellar wind, although observations of many SNe do not support this assumption.   We extend previous work by considering shocks expanding into complex density profiles consisting of smooth winds with dense CSM shells at various distances from the progenitor star. We aim to predict the gamma-ray and multiwavelength signatures of CSM interaction.   We used the PION code to model the CSM around LBV including a brief episode of enhanced mass-loss and to simulate the formation of photoionization-confined shells around RSGs. Consequently, we used the time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic rays in SNe expanding into these media and to evaluate the emitted radiation across the whole electromagnetic spectrum.   We find that the interaction with the CSM shells can significantly boost the gamma-ray emission, with the emission peaking weeks to years after the explosion. The peak luminosity for Type-IIP and Type-IIn remnants can exceed the luminosity expected for smooth winds by orders of magnitude. For Type-IIP explosions, the light-curve peak is only reached years after the explosion. We evaluate the multiwavelength signatures expected from the interaction of the blast wave with a dense CSM shell from radio, over optical, to thermal X-rays.   We identify high-cadence optical surveys and continuous monitoring of nearby SN in radio and mm wavelengths as the best-suited strategies for identifying targets that should be followed-up by gamma-ray observatories.

We take the results from three-dimensional SN simulations of Pakmor et al 2022 (arXiv:2203.14990) and carry them into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, until 1500 yr after the explosion. We reveal signatures of the SN imprinted in the SNR morphology. We confirm the impact of a companion on the SNR: its presence induces a conical shadow in the ejecta, that is long lived. Its intersection with the shocked shell is visible in projection as a ring, an ellipse, or a bar, depending on the orientation. New, we test the case of a nested explosion model, in which the explosion of the primary induces the secondary to also explode. As the explosion of the secondary WD is weaker only the primary outer ejecta interact with the ambient medium and form the main SNR shell. The secondary inner ejecta collide with the reverse shock, which enhances the density and thus the X-ray emissivity. The composition at the points of impact is peculiar, since what is revealed are the outer layers from the inner ejecta.

We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool and from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of supernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle acceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the total proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our results indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during the first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated multi-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be detectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is found to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the test-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a growing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and the effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles are confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron spectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR shock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA can take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total electron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from thermonuclear and core-collapse SNe.

Using the CosmoDC2\\_BCO catalog, we forecast cosmological constraints from current (LVK) and next-generation (ET, CE) detector networks, in combination with a Roman-like Type Ia supernova sample. We find that third-generation networks reach sub-percent precision on the Hubble constant within a few years, achieving 0.2% after a decade with CE+ET+LVK, while LVK remains limited to the 6% level. The LVK fifth observing run may shed light on the H\\_0 tension only if the inferred value falls outside the range spanned by the Planck and SH0ES determinations, which currently achieve far higher precisions. Supernovae do not directly tighten H\\_0 but stabilize its inference through parameter correlations and enable an absolute calibration of the supernova magnitude M\\_B. In dynamical dark-energy models, the joint analysis of Roman supernovae and bright sirens yields a Figure of Merit of 25 for ET+LVK and 76 for CE+ET+LVK, to be compared with the state-of-the-art DESI DR2 BAO plus DESY5 supernovae value of 56. Sky-localization thresholds of DeltaOmega < 50 deg^2, or even DeltaOmega < 10 deg^2, entail only mild penalties, suggesting efficient follow-up strategies. These results establish third-generation GW+EM observations, especially when combined with Roman supernovae, as a cornerstone for precision cosmology in the next decade.\n\n", "2510.18706": "2025-10-21, **Binding energy of compact stars and their non-radial oscillations**, P. Laskos-Patkos et.al., [2510.18706v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18706v1)\n\n In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p\\_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.\n\n", "2510.18498": "2025-10-21, **Unveiling the nature of HE 0107-5240**, E. Caffau et.al., [2510.18498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18498v1)\n\n The vast majority of the most iron-poor stars in the Galaxy exhibit a strong carbon enhancement, with C/H ratios only about two orders of magnitude below solar. This unusual chemical composition likely reflects the properties of the gas cloud from which these stars formed, having been enriched by one, or at most a few, supernovae. A remarkable member of this stellar class, HE 0107-5240 with [Fe/H]=-5.56, has been identified as part of a binary system. To constrain its orbital parameters, radial velocity monitoring has been carried out using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Radial velocities were derived using cross-correlation with a template, taking advantage of the strong G-band feature. Combining all observations yielded a high signal-to-noise spectrum, which has been used to refine our understanding of the stellar chemical composition. Additionally, a co-added UVES spectrum in the blue was used to complement the wavelength coverage of ESPRESSO. Observations of HE 0107-5240 over a span of more than four years have yielded a revised orbital period of about 29 years. Updated elemental abundances have been determined for Sc, Cr, Co, and, tentatively, Al, along with a new upper limit for Be. The iron abundance has been derived from ionised Fe lines. Significant upper limits have been established for Li, Si, and Sr. The star is confirmed to be a long-period binary. Iron abundances derived from neutral and ionised lines are consistent with local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) assumption, casting doubt on published deviation from LTE corrections for Fe for this star. The heavy elements Sr and Ba remain undetected, confirming the classification of HE 0107-5240 as a carbon enhanced metal-poor and non enhanced in heavy elements (CEMP-no) star and supporting the absence of an n-capture element plateau at the lowest metallicities.\n\n"}}
