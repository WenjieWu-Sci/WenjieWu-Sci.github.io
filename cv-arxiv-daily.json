In the original SuSAM model, a universal scaling function was fitted to a selected set of quasielastic electron scattering (e,e') cross section data, using a phenomenological ansatz inspired by the Relativistic Mean Field model of nuclear matter. In this work, we refine the procedure by first fitting a longitudinal scaling function directly to experimental longitudinal response data. Subsequently, a separate transverse scaling function is extracted from purely transverse data, after subtracting the longitudinal contribution already determined. We find that the resulting transverse scaling function must exhibit an explicit dependence on the momentum transfer q in order to reproduce all kinematics consistently. The resulting SuSAM-v2 model simultaneously describes inclusive quasielastic cross sections and both longitudinal and transverse response functions in electron scattering. The model is then applied to neutrino-nucleus scattering, showing an improved prediction compared to the previous SuSAM-v1 version, due to a more accurate treatment of the relative contributions of the longitudinal and transverse weak nuclear responses.\n\n", "2506.03716": "2025-06-04, **The precision measurement of the electron anti-neutrino spectrum in beta-decay of $\\rm{^{144}Pr}$ nuclei**, A.

However, there are scenarios where these powerful explosions may not have any observable electromagnetic signal, but would still have strong detectable emission in gravitational waves and neutrinos. A regular CCSN explosion may be obscured by matter in the Galaxy. A star may undergo a failed CCSN explosion, where the stalled shockwave is not revived, and would eventually form a black hole. Higher mass progenitor stars may revive the shock, but form a black hole too quickly for the shockwave to reach the surface of the star and produce an electromagnetic signal. Previous work has shown that we can determine if a black hole forms from the CCSN neutrino emission if there are long duration sinusoidal modulations in the neutrino signal caused by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). The SASI also produces an observable signature in the gravitational-wave emission. In this paper, we investigate if we can distinguish between different scenarios for electromagnetically dark CCSNe using the gravitational-wave emission alone. We find, using a reconstruction of the SASI mode, abrupt end times of the gravitational-wave emission, and the rate of change of frequency of the dominant mode, that we are able to accurately distinguish between an obscured CCSN, a failed CCSN, and an explosion with fast black hole formation.\n\n", "2506.03376": "2025-06-03, **Recent results from MicroBooNE**, Holly B.

Within a non-linear relativistic mean field description, the framework allows for a systematic variation of nuclear parameters within the range allowed by uncertainties in nuclear experimental data, ensuring compatibility with nuclear theory, astrophysical and heavy-ion data. We then investigate the role of nuclear and hypernuclear parameters on NS macroscopic properties and $f$-mode oscillations in hot neutron stars within Cowling approximation.

Here we introduce the concept of turbulent flavor-wave viscosity and develop techniques for including it in miscidynamics. This extension of the theory is necessary when neutrinos develop weak flavor instabilities as a result of astrophysical driving. The flavor-wave dispersion relation is obtained using a new and more general form of linear analysis, which does not require small flavor coherence. Flavor-wave transport is then approximated using wave kinetics and geometric optics. We hypothesize that the dynamical emergence of local oscillation invariants restricts the extent of flavor thermalization. In this view, flavor evolution is sculpted by both entropy-increasing and order-promoting factors.\n\n", "2506.03255": "2025-06-03, **Reducing Hadronic Uncertainty in Low-Energy Neutral-Current Processes**, Oleksandr Tomalak et.al., [2506.03255v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03255v1)\n\n We analyze the dominant hadronic uncertainty in low-energy neutral-current (anti)neutrino scattering, estimated at the $3$-$4$ per mille level.

ESO444-G084 shows centrally concentrated HI emission, while [KKS2000]23 exhibits irregular high-density clumps. Total HI fluxes measured down to 10^19 and 10^18 cm^-2 are nearly identical, indicating that the increased HI diameter at lower column densities results mainly from the larger beam, with no significant extra emission detected.

If ULDM interacts with ordinary matter, it can induce measurable, characteristic signals in pulsar-timing data because it causes the orbits of pulsars in binary systems to osculate. In this work, we investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques to detect such ULDM signals. To this end, we construct three types of neural networks: an autoencoder, a binary classifier, and a multiclass classifier. We apply these methods to four theoretically well-motivated ULDM models: a linearly coupled scalar field, a quadratically coupled scalar field, a vector field and a tensor field. We show that the sensitivity achieved using ML methods is comparable to that of a semi-analytical Bayesian approach, which to date has only been applied to the linear scalar case. The ML approach is readily applicable to all four ULDM models and, in the case of the multiclass classifier, can distinguish between them.

This source shows point-like emission ($\\lesssim 0.1^\\circ$) and a strong suppression in its energy-differential spectrum in the ten TeV energy regime, modeled well by a power-law with an exponential cutoff. The origin of this emission is debated, with candidate emission scenarios including dark matter annihilations, millisecond pulsars in the central stellar clusters, and hadronic interactions in the vicinity of Sagittarius A*. Deriving the sensitivity to these spectral models is key to discriminating the physical processes at work. We show that combining H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS archival data can well described the observed emission by a power-law with an exponential energy cutoff within the present uncertainties. Given the near advent of the array of the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) at CTAO-N, we timely simulate realistic upcoming observations of the central emission by the CTAO-N four-LST array, to derive the sensitivity to resolve the sharpness of the spectral energy cutoff. We find that 500 hours of four-LST observations taken at large zenith angles, possibly accumulated over several years, can significantly discriminate the dark-matter emission scenario from the leptonic and hadronic ones. Also, a preliminary 3$\\sigma$ hint for such discrimination could emerge within the first year.

The observations of galaxies only pertain to the non-relativistic form of gravity. In this context, within the framework of the Newtonian theory of gravity (the non-relativistic form of GR), dark matter is postulated to account for the observations. On the other hand, the non-relativistic form of CG predicts an additional potential: besides the Newtonian potential, there is a so-called linear potential term, characterized by the parameter $\\gamma^*$, as an alternative to dark matter in Newtonian gravity. To test CG in its non-relativistic form, much work has been done by fitting the predictions to the observations of circular velocity (rotation curves) for spiral galaxies. In this paper, we test CG with the observations from elliptical galaxies. Instead of the circular velocities for spiral galaxies, we use the velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies. By replacing the Newtonian potential with that predicted by non-relativistic form of CG in Hamiltonian, we directly extend the Jeans equation derived in Newtonian theory to that for CG. By comparing the results derived from the ellipticals with that from spirals, we find that the extra potential predicted by CG is not sufficient to account for the observations of ellipticals. Furthermore, we discover a strong correlation between $\\gamma^*$ and the stellar mass $M^*$ in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This finding implies that the variation in $\\gamma^*$ violates a fundamental prediction of Conformal Gravity (CG), which posits that $\\gamma^*$ should be a universal constant.\n\n", "2506.03904": "2025-06-04, **Gravothermal expansion of dwarf spheroidal galaxies heated by dark subhaloes**, Jorge Pe\u00f1arrubia et.al., [2506.03904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03904v1)\n\n We use analytical and $N$-body methods to study the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) embedded in dark matter (DM) haloes that host a sizeable subhalo population. Dark subhaloes generate a fluctuating gravitational field that injects energy into stellar orbits, driving a gradual expansion of dSphs. Despite the overall expansion, the stellar density profile preserves its initial shape, suggesting that the evolution proceeds in a self-similar manner. Meanwhile, the velocity dispersion profile, initially flat, evolves as the galaxy expands: the inner regions heat up, while the outer regions cool down. Kinematically, this resembles gravothermal collapse but with an inverted evolution, instead of collapsing the stellar system expands within a fluctuating halo potential. As the half-light radius $r\\_{\\rm half}$ approaches the halo peak velocity radius $r\\_{\\rm max}$, the expansion slows, and the velocity dispersion peaks at $\\sigma\\_{\\rm max} \\simeq 0.27 v\\_{\\rm max}$. The stellar heat capacity remains positive for deeply embedded stars but diverges near $r\\_{\\rm max}$, turning negative beyond this threshold, which indicates a phase transition in the dynamical response to energy injection.

This approach enables analytical exploration of atomic-scale transport within the lattice without necessitating parameterization. The quenching factors across the nuclear recoil energy range from 20 eV to 10 keV have been thoroughly investigated. A remarkable agreement with experimental data is achieved, particularly for the minimal energy regime conducted to date, reaching the level of a single electron-hole pair. This work presents evidence of a crucial and fundamental distribution of the quenching factor, which can be associated to the collisional interactions underlying the transport phenomena. The region below 4 keV of the quenching factor, where discrepancies have been observed with the Lindhard's model, is found to be significantly attributed to the lattice binding effect and the specific crystal structure. In contrast, a gradual functional relationship is identified below approximately 100 eV, indicating that the quenching factor is influenced by the crystallographic orientation of the target material. From a distributional perspective, our analysis allows for the determination of the minimum exclusion mass for the dark matter nucleon elastic scattering channel at 0.29 $\\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity for the sub-$\\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass region.\n\n", "2506.03678": "2025-06-04, **Searching for Dark Galaxies with HI detection from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey**, Minseong Kwon et.al., [2506.03678v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03678v1)\n\n We present a catalog of 142 dark galaxy candidates in a region covered by the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey.

To do that, we first eliminate 83 sources that are known HI clouds probably formed from tidal interactions between galaxies and 13 sources that have optical counterparts. We then remove 56 sources located near other HI sources, which are likely to be HI clouds.

Within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, we model the collapse of a homogeneous matter distribution and show that the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce at the Planck density. By analytically matching the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) interior to an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime using the Israel junction conditions, we demonstrate that the bounce remains causally hidden from external observers, avoiding any observable re-expansion. This naturally leads to the formation of stable, non-radiating PSR, whose radius coincides with the Schwarzschild radius when the black hole mass approaches the Planck mass as a result of Hawking evaporation. We suggest that such remnants may originate from evaporating primordial black holes in the early universe, and estimate the relic abundance needed for PSR to account for the observed dark matter density. We also discuss some crucial differences between PSR and previous proposals of Planck mass relics.

In the Affleck-Dine mechanism, the baryon asymmetry is naturally proportional to the inflationary reheating temperature $T\\_{\\rm rh}$, which also plays a critical role in setting the relic abundance of UV freeze-in dark matter. Since Affleck-Dine baryogenesis requires flat directions in the potential, the framework is inherently supersymmetric, offering compelling UV freeze-in dark matter candidates such as the gravitino. We outline scenarios in which $T\\_{\\rm rh}$ simultaneously determines both relic abundances, resulting in a baryon-to-dark matter ratio of order unity that is largely insensitive to $T\\_{\\rm rh}$.

We also present a \"cusp-NFW\" functional form that accurately describes the density profile of a halo with a prompt cusp at its center. Accurate characterization of each halo's central cusp is of particular importance in the study of warm dark matter models, for which the spectral cutoff is on an astrophysically relevant mass scale.

We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at $z \\sim 5$ originates from halos in the lowest $\\sim 1\\%$ of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined \"LRDs Era\" at $4<z<8$, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at $z<4$, they are bright but rare, while at $z>8$, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.\n\n", "2506.03132": "2025-06-03, **A Fuzzy Situation Eased: Cold Dark Matter with Multipoles Can Explain The Double Radio Quad Lens HS 0810+2554**, John H.

When smooth, elliptical CDM mass models fail, multipoles often emerge as solutions. With the discovery of two radio jets in the source quasar, the strong gravitational lens HS 0810+2554 can no longer be well fit by elliptical mass models, suggesting perturbations on small-scales. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of multipoles $m=1$ (lopsidedness), $m=3$ (triangleness), and $m=4$ (boxiness and diskiness) in addressing the image positional anomalies of the two radio quads of HS 0810+2554. Due to the exact pairing and arrival sequence of the images being unknown, we consider all feasible image configurations. With 64 unique best-fit models, we achieve a fit of $\\chi=1.59$ ($\\chi^2=2.53$), with $m=1,3,4$ multipole strengths of 0.9%, 0.4%, and 0.6%, respectively, with images in the reverse time ordering.

Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231.

We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias.

These dense regions are ideal sites for the formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which stellar-mass compact objects gradually spiral into SMBH, emitting gravitational waves (GWs). Space-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories such as LISA and Taiji will be sensitive to these signals, including early-stage EMRIs (E-EMRIs) that persist in the low-frequency band for extended periods. In this work, we investigate the impact of dark matter-induced dynamical friction on E-EMRIs in the Milky Way Center, model its effect on the trajectory, and calculate the resulting modifications to the GW spectrum. Our analysis suggests that this influence might be sizable and lead to detectable deviations in the spectrum, namely suppression at low frequencies and enhancement at high frequencies, therefore providing a potential probe for dark matter with future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.\n\n", "2506.02848": "2025-06-03, **Active galactic nuclei through the prism of galaxy clusters: bounds on axion-like particles**, Denys Malyshev et.al., [2506.02848v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02848v1)\n\n Hypothetical axion-like particles (ALPs) are of interest because of their potential to act as dark matter or to reveal information about yet undiscovered fundamental constituents of matter. Such particles can be created when photons traverse regions of magnetic fields. The conversion probability depends on both the magnetic field parameters and photon energy, leading to multiple spectral absorption features as light passes through magnetized regions.   Traditionally, astrophysical searches have focused on detecting such features in individual objects. However, the limited understanding of properties of cosmic magnetic fields have hindered the progress. Here we introduce a new approach by analyzing stacked (rather than individual) spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) positioned behind galaxy clusters -- gigantic magnetic field reservoirs. Stacking efficiently averages over the uncertainties in magnetic fields, revealing a unique step-like spectral signature of photon-to-ALP conversion.   With this approach we advance into previously inaccessible regions of the ALP parameter space for nano-electronvolt masses. Adopting this method will significantly improve existing bounds across a wide range of masses by using different telescopes and increasing the size of the stacked datasets. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, in particular, will extensively probe the parameter space where ALPs could serve as dark matter.\n\n", "2506.03226": "2025-06-03, **Cascade Relaxation of the Gravitating Vacuum as a Generator of the Evolving Universe**, V.

The cascade vacuum relaxation creates the entire observable cosmology from the Friedmann model with small perturbations of the metric with non-power-law power spectra from which primordial black holes could have arisen, and gravitational waves over a wide wavenumber range to the formation of dark matter and energy, early galaxies, supermassive black holes, and the large-scale structure of the Universe. An observational model of cascade vacuum relaxation in the early Universe has been build, which contains two constants determined by observational data and does not require information on the potential of the fields. A solution has been obtained for the general relativity vacuum attractor, including, in addition to the two previously mentioned constants, the third constant (not yet limited by observations), which leads to an additional power of density perturbations on a small scale ($k>10\\,$Mpc$^{-1}$) in the form of a ``bump'', a two-power-law spectrum, etc.\n\n", "2506.02400": "2025-06-03, **Caustic fringes for wave dark matter**, Andrew Eberhardt et.al., [2506.02400v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02400v1)\n\n Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2506.04184": "2025-06-04, **Core-collapse supernova parameter estimation with the upcoming Vera C.

With its unprecedented depth, the LSST will survey the southern hemisphere sky, generating nearly 32 trillion observations over its nominal 10-year operation. Among these, approximately 10 million will be supernovae (SNe). These observations will uniquely characterize the SN population, enabling studies of known and rare SN types, detailed parameterization of their light curves, deep searches for new SN progenitor populations, the discovery of strongly lensed SNe, and the compilation of a large, well-characterized sample of superluminous SNe. We analyzed a sample of 22663 simulations of LSST light curves for core collapse SNe (CCSNe), modeled using the radiative transfer code STELLA. We analyzed this dataset with the software CASTOR, which enables the reconstruction of synthetic light curves and spectra via a machine learning technique that allows one to retrieve the complete parameter map of a SN. For each parameter we compared the observed and the true values, determining how LSST light curves alone will contribute to characterize the progenitor and the explosion. Our results indicate that LSST alone will not suffice for a comprehensive and precise characterization of progenitor properties and explosion parameters. The limited spectral coverage of LSST light curves (in most cases) does not allow for the accurate estimation of bolometric luminosity, and consequently, of the explosion energy and nickel yield. Additionally, the redshift-absorption degeneracy is difficult to resolve without supplementary information. These findings suggest that for the most interesting SNe, complementary follow-up observations using spectrographs and optical facilities (particularly in the infrared bands) will be essential for accurate parameter determination.\n\n", "2506.04066": "2025-06-04, **Europium, we have a problem.

An extensive effort was made in the last decade to model the chemical evolution of this element in the Galaxy. However, less attention was reserved to Eu in different galaxies of the Local Group (LG). Aims: By employing detailed and well-tested chemical evolution models, we investigate Eu enrichment across LG dwarf spheroidal galaxies, allowing for a direct comparison between model predictions for dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way (MW). Methods: Building upon an r-process enrichment framework that successfully reproduces the observed Eu abundance patterns as well as the supernova and compact binary merger rates in the MW, we build chemical evolution models for the Sagittarius, Fornax, and Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxies and test the enrichment scenario against the abundance patterns observed in these galaxies. Results: Models reproducing the Galactic Eu patterns significantly underestimate the [Eu/Fe] ratios observed in LG dwarfs. To address this \"missing Eu\" problem, we estimate the Eu production rate needed to match the observations and explore potential contributions either from prompt or delayed sources, assessing their compatibility with the MW observables. Conclusions: The same r-process enrichment frameworks cannot reproduce simultaneously the Eu patterns both in the MW and in dwarf galaxies. However, a scenario where additional Eu is provided by an increased production from delayed sources at low metallicity can theoretically reconcile the trends observed in the MW and in LG dwarfs, because of the small discrepancies (0.1 dex) between model predictions and observations found in this case.

The observations of galaxies only pertain to the non-relativistic form of gravity. In this context, within the framework of the Newtonian theory of gravity (the non-relativistic form of GR), dark matter is postulated to account for the observations. On the other hand, the non-relativistic form of CG predicts an additional potential: besides the Newtonian potential, there is a so-called linear potential term, characterized by the parameter $\\gamma^*$, as an alternative to dark matter in Newtonian gravity. To test CG in its non-relativistic form, much work has been done by fitting the predictions to the observations of circular velocity (rotation curves) for spiral galaxies. In this paper, we test CG with the observations from elliptical galaxies. Instead of the circular velocities for spiral galaxies, we use the velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies. By replacing the Newtonian potential with that predicted by non-relativistic form of CG in Hamiltonian, we directly extend the Jeans equation derived in Newtonian theory to that for CG. By comparing the results derived from the ellipticals with that from spirals, we find that the extra potential predicted by CG is not sufficient to account for the observations of ellipticals. Furthermore, we discover a strong correlation between $\\gamma^*$ and the stellar mass $M^*$ in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This finding implies that the variation in $\\gamma^*$ violates a fundamental prediction of Conformal Gravity (CG), which posits that $\\gamma^*$ should be a universal constant.\n\n", "2506.03836": "2025-06-04, **An independent estimate of H(z) at z = 0.5 from the stellar ages of brightest cluster galaxies**, S.

Unlike previous CC studies, we used only brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), the oldest and most massive galaxies in the Universe, to construct a pure and homogeneous sample.

Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from \\textit{the Pandora suite}, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings.

We show that both can be in agreement with observations, although they cannot alleviate the $H\\_0$ tension. However, applying information criteria we deduce that both of them are not favoured comparing to $\\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmological paradigm.\n\n", "2506.02731": "2025-06-03, **Bulk/boundary Modular Quintessence and DESI**, Luis A. Anchordoqui et.al., [2506.02731v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02731v1)\n\n The latest DESI DR2 results, when combined with other independent cosmological data on the Cosmic Microwave Background and supernovas, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy.   We propose a novel cosmological scenario, which features two distinct scalar fields. One governs the magnitude of the present-day dark energy density and is related to the size of extra-dimensions. Accounting for the observed smallness of this energy density requires the scalar to reside near the boundary of field space.   The second field, responsible for the time evolution of dark energy and associated with the string coupling, must instead lie in the bulk to remain consistent with the non-observation of light string states. We show that a natural candidate for such dark energy dynamics is a quintessence modular-invariant potential, in which the second scalar field rolls down a negatively curved slope, starting from a self-dual critical point. We find that this scenario is in good agreement with the latest findings by DESI.\n\n", "2506.02551": "2025-06-03, **Impact of convective overshooting on the single-degenerate model of Type Ia supernovae**, Xinghuan Wang et.al., [2506.02551v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02551v2)\n\n The single-degenerate (SD) model is one of the principal models for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However, it faces some challenges, the primary being its inability to account for the observed SN Ia birth rate. Many studies have attempted to address this issue by expanding the parameter space, defined by the initial donor star mass and orbital period, that can lead to SNe Ia, as well as by improving binary population synthesis. While these efforts have led to significant progress, many uncertainties in stellar physics persist, which influences the outcomes of such studies. Convective overshooting, which can significantly affect the internal structure of a star and subsequently its evolution within a binary system, is one of the most significant sources of uncertainty in stellar physics. We investigate the effect of convective overshooting on the parameter space and birth rate of SNe Ia within the SD model. We employed the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, a new version of the SD model, as our progenitor model. Using MESA, we obtained the parameter space that leads to SNe Ia for three different convective overshooting parameters and calculated the corresponding SN Ia birth rate. Convective overshooting expands the upper boundaries (corresponding to a larger initial donor mass) and right boundaries (corresponding to a longer initial orbital period) of the parameter space for systems with massive white dwarfs (WDs; >= 0.75Msun). However, the minimum WD mass and the parameter space for low-mass WDs - and, consequently, the calculated SN Ia birth rate - vary non-monotonically with convective overshooting parameters. The CEW model may explain the SNe Ia that interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., SNe Ia-CSM. We find that the parameter space for SNe Ia-CSM increases with convective overshooting parameters, as does their birth rate.\n\n", "2506.02476": "2025-06-03, **A chemical close-up of the main body of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy**, Alessio Liberatori et.al., [2506.02476v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02476v1)\n\n We present the chemical composition of a sample of 37 red giant branch (RGB) stars belonging to the main body of the remnant of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. All stars were observed with the FLAMES-UVES high-resolution spectrograph. Twenty-three new targets are selected along the blue side of the RGB of Sgr, but outside the galaxy stellar nucleus, in order to avoid contamination by the stars of the metal-poor globular cluster M54. Additionally, we re-analyzed archival spectra of fourteen targets located on the red RGB. For this sample, we derive the abundances of 21 chemical species (from Oxygen to Europium) representing different nucleosynthetic sites. The sample covers a large range of metallicity, from [Fe/H]~-2 to ~ -0.4 dex and we can identify the transition between the enrichment phases dominated by core-collapse (CC-SNe) and Type Ia (SNe-Ia) supernovae. The observed [{\\alpha}/Fe] trend suggests a knee occurring at [Fe/H]~-1.5/-1.3 dex, compatible with the rather low star formation efficiency of Sgr. At lower [Fe/H], Sgr stars exhibit a chemical composition compatible with Milky Way stars of similar [Fe/H]. The only relevant exceptions are [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Eu/Fe]. At [Fe/H] higher than ~ -1.5/-1.3 dex, instead, the chemical pattern of Sgr significantly deviates from that of the Milky Way for almost all the elements analyzed in this study. Some of the abundance patterns reveal a lower contribution by very massive stars exploding as hypernovae (e.g. [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe]), a higher contribution by sub-Chandrasekhar progenitors of SNe Ia (e.g. [Ni/Fe]) and a high production efficiency of rapid neutron-capture elements ([Eu/Fe]).\n\n"}}
