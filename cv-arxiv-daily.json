Since chirality is not a conserved quantity, chiral oscillations take place and affects the flavor transition probability. By means of the complete complementarity relations, we analyze how correlations and coherence are redistributed in time between the different degrees-of-freedoms of the system. In a similar way, we consider a spin entangled lepton-antineutrino pair and describe the redistribution of the spin-spin entanglement into correlations between the other degrees-of-freedom. In both cases the effects of chiral oscillations are relevant in the non-relativistic regime. Our analysis provides a complete characterization of the quantum correlations involved in lepton-antineutrino pairs and in single particle neutrino evolution, and provides a further insight on possible routes to interpret and measure chiral oscillations.\n\n", "2308.14501": "2023-08-28, **Neutrino amplitude decomposition, $S$ matrix rephasing invariance, and reparametrization symmetry**, Hisakazu Minakata et.al., [2308.14501v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14501v1)\n\n The $S$ matrix rephasing invariance is one of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that originates in its probabilistic interpretation.

Among several interesting attempts, $U(1)$ gauge extension of Standard Model (SM) is a simple and interesting set-up where the so-called seesaw mechanism is incarnated by the addition of three generations of right-handed neutrinos followed by the breaking of $U(1)$ and electroweak symmetries.

Stellar orbits randomly walk over a Hubble time, perturbed by the pervasive \"granular\" interference pattern of $\\psi$DM, that fully modulates the dark matter density on the de Broglie scale. Our simulations quantify the level of stellar disk thickening over the Hubble time, showing that distribution of stars is predicted to become an oblate spheroid of increasing radius, that plausibly accounts for the morphology of dSph galaxies. We predict a low level of residual rotation remains after a Hubble time at the 1-3 km/s level, depending on orientation, that compares with recent claims of rotation for some well studied local dSph galaxies.

When dimension-4 and dimension-6 Higgs-portal interactions are proportional to mass squares for Higgs or scalar dark matter in certain microscopic models such as massive graviton, radion or general metric couplings with conformal and disconformal modes, we can take the dimension-8 derivative Higgs-portal interactions to be dominant for determining the relic density via the 2-to-2 thermal scattering of the Higgs fields after reheating.

In this work, we investigate the impact of non-perturbative effects in the indirect detection of dark matter. For this purpose we utilize a minimal model consisting of a fermionic dark matter candidate in the TeV mass range that interacts via scalar- and pseudo-scalar interactions with a massive scalar mediator mixing with the Higgs. The scalar interaction induces an attractive Yukawa potential between dark matter particles, such that annihilations are Sommerfeld enhanced, and bound states can form. These non-perturbative effects are systematically dealt with (potential) non-relativistic effective field theories and we derive the relevant cross sections for dark matter. We discuss their impact on the relic density and indirect detection. Annihilations in dwarf galaxies and the Galactic Center require special care and we derive generalized $J$-factors for these objects that account for the non-trivial velocity dependence of the cross sections in our model. We use limits on the gamma-ray flux based on Fermi-LAT observations and limits on the rate of exotic energy injection from Planck to derive bounds on the parameter space of the model.

In this paper, we investigate the possible regimes of motion of stars in the axisymmetric approximation of a Galactic potential model. The model consists of three components: the axisymmetric disk, the central spheroidal bulge and the spherical halo of dark matter. The axisymmetric disk is divided into stellar and gaseous disk subcomponents, each one modeled by three Miyamoto-Nagai profiles. The physical and structural parameters of the Galaxy components are adjusted by observational kinematic constraints. The phase space of the two-degrees-of-freedom model is studied by means of the Poincar\\'e and dynamical mapping, the dynamical spectrum method and the direct numerical integrations of the Hamiltonian equations of motion. For the chosen physical parameters, the nearly-circular and low-altitude stellar behaviour is composed of two weakly coupled simple oscillations, radial and vertical motions. The amplitudes of the vertical oscillations of these orbits are gradually increasing with the growing Galactocentric distances, in concordance with the exponential mass decay assumed. However, for increasing planar eccentricities and the altitudes over the equatorial disk, new regimes of stellar motion emerge as a result of the beating between the radial and vertical oscillation frequencies, which we refer to as e-z resonances. The corresponding resonant motion produces characteristic sudden increase or decrease of the amplitude of the vertical oscillation, bifurcations in the dynamical spectra and the chains of islands of stable motion in the phase space.

Considering the microlensing effects caused by discrete masses, the magnification map in the source plane exhibits a complex structure, which offers a promising way for detecting dark matter. However, simulating microlensing near the critical curve poses challenges due to magnification divergence and the substantial computational demands involved. To achieve the required simulation accuracy, direct inverse ray-shooting would require significant computational resources. Therefore we applied a GPU-based code optimized with interpolation method to enable efficient computation on a large scale. Using the GPU of NVIDIA Tesla V100S PCIe 32GB, it takes approximately 7000 seconds to calculate the effects of around 13,000 microlenses for a simulation involving 1013 emitted rays.

Subsequently, under the black-body assumption for the SLSN spectra at each moment of time, we reconstructed the bolometric light curves.

This transient event, influenced by the disc gas and the gravity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH), exhibits distinct characteristics compared to normal SNe Ia. The energy of the explosion is mainly stored in the ejecta in the form of kinetic energy. Typically, the ejecta is not effectively decelerated by the AGN disc and rushes rapidly out of the AGN disc. However, under the influence of the SMBH, most of the ejecta falls back toward the AGN disc. As the fallback ejecta becomes more dispersed, it interacts with the disc gas, converting its kinetic energy into thermal energy. This results in a high-energy transient characterized by a rapid initial rise followed by a decay with $L\\propto t^{-2.8}$. The time-scale of the transient ranges from hours to weeks, depending on the mass of the SMBH. This process generates high-energy radiation spanning from hard X-rays to the soft $\\gamma$ range. Additionally, the subsequent damage to the disc may result in changing-look AGNs.

These systems could be dynamical unstable, which can lead to very close encounters or direct collisions. In this work, we use N-body simulations to study the evolution of such systems with the different initial orbital separation $p$, relative orbital inclination $\\Delta{i}$ and SMBH mass $M$. It is found that the close encounters of WDs mainly occur at $1.1R\\_{\\rm H} \\lesssim p \\lesssim 2\\sqrt{3}R\\_{\\rm H}$, where $R\\_{\\rm H}$ is the mutual Hill radius. For $p<1.1R\\_{\\rm H}$, the majority of WDs move in horseshoe or tadpole orbits, and only few of them with small initial orbital phase difference undergo close encounters. For $p=3.0R\\_{\\rm H}$, WD-WD collisions occur in most of the samples within a time of $10^5P\\_1$, and considerable collisions occur within a time of $t<62P\\_1$ for small orbital radii, where $P\\_1$ is the orbital period.

The closest separation distribution is similar in cases with the different SMBH mass, but the WD-WD collision fraction decreases as the mass of SMBHs increases. According to our estimation, the event rate of the cosmic WD-WD collision in AGN discs is about $300{\\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, roughly $1\\%$ of the one of the observed type Ia supernova.

Blanchard et.al., [2308.14197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14197v1)\n\n Identifying the astrophysical sites of the $r$-process, one of the primary mechanisms by which heavy elements are formed, is a key goal of modern astrophysics. The discovery of the brightest gamma-ray burst of all time, GRB 221009A, at a relatively nearby redshift, presented the first opportunity to spectroscopically test the idea that $r$-process elements are produced following the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars. Here we present spectroscopic and photometric $\\textit{James Webb Space Telescope}$ (JWST) observations of GRB 221009A obtained $+168$ and $+170$ rest-frame days after the initial gamma-ray trigger, and demonstrate they are well-described by a supernova (SN) and power-law afterglow, with no evidence for an additional component from $r$-process emission, and that the SN component strongly resembles the near-infrared spectra of previous SNe, including SN 1998bw. We further find that the SN associated with GRB 221009A is slightly fainter than the expected brightness of SN 1998bw at this phase, concluding that the SN is therefore not an unusual GRB-SN. We infer a nickel mass of $\\approx0.09$ M$\\_{\\odot}$, consistent with the lack of an obvious SN detection in the early-time data. We find that the host galaxy of GRB 221009A has a very low metallicity of $\\approx0.12$ Z$\\_{\\odot}$ and our resolved host spectrum shows that GRB 221009A occurred in a unique environment in its host characterized by strong H$\\_2$ emission lines consistent with recent star formation, which may hint at environmental factors being responsible for its extreme energetics.\n\n"}}
