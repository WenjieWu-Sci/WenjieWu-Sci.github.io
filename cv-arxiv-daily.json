In an effective theory approach, the SM fermion masses and mixing patterns are generated in orders of the parameter related to the vacuum expectation value of the flavon field and the cut-off of the effective theory. By introducing right-handed neutrinos, we study the viability of the lightest right-handed neutrino as a dark matter candidate, where the same flavon field acts as a mediator between the dark and the SM sectors. We find that dark matter genesis is achieved both through freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms encompassing the $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{GeV})$ -- $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{TeV})$ mass range of the mediator and the dark matter particle. In addition to tree-level spin-dependent cross section, the model gives rise to tree- and loop-level contributions to spin-independent scattering cross section at the direct detection experiments such as XENON and LUX-ZEPLIN which can be probed in their future upgrades. By choosing suitable Froggatt-Nielsen charges for the fermions, we also generate the mass spectrum of the SM neutrinos via the Type-I seesaw mechanism. Flavor-changing neutral current processes, such as radiative lepton decay, meson mixing, and top-quark decay remain the most constraining channels and provide testability for this minimal setup that addresses several major shortcomings of the SM.\n\n", "2307.14869": "2023-07-27, **Parity Solution to the Strong CP Problem and a Unified Framework for Inflation, Baryogenesis, and Dark Matter**, K. S. Babu et.al., [2307.14869v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14869v1)\n\n It has been known for some time that asymptotic parity invariance of weak interactions can provide a solution to the strong CP problem without the need for the axion. Left-right symmetric theories which employ a minimal Higgs sector consisting of a left-handed and a right-handed doublet is an example of such a theory wherein all fermion masses arise through a generalized seesaw mechanism. In this paper we present a way to understand the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry as well as the dark matter content of the universe in these theories using the Affleck-Dine (AD) leptogenesis mechanism and inflaton decay, respectively. Three gauge singlet fermions are needed for this purpose, two of which help to implement the Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses while the third one becomes the non-thermal warm dark matter candidate. A soft lepton number breaking term involving the AD scalar field is used to generate lepton asymmetry which suffers no wash-out effects and maintains the Dirac nature of neutrinos. This framework thus provides a unified description of many of the unresolved puzzles of the standard model that require new physics.\n\n", "2307.14842": "2023-07-27, **Observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Galactic plane**, Stephen Sclafani et.al., [2307.14842v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14842v1)\n\n IceCube has discovered a flux of astrophysical neutrinos and presented evidence for the first neutrino sources, a flaring blazar known as TXS 0506+056 and the active galaxy NGC 1068. However, the sources responsible for the majority of the astrophysical neutrino flux remain elusive. In addition to hypothetical sources within our Galaxy, high energy neutrinos are produced when cosmic rays interact at their acceleration sites and during propagation through the interstellar medium. The Galactic plane has therefore long been hypothesized as a neutrino source. In this contribution, new results are presented for searches of neutrino sources utilizing a dataset that builds upon recent advances in deep-learning-based reconstruction methods for neutrino-induced cascades. This work presents the first observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Milky Way Galaxy, rejecting the background-only hypothesis at 4.5$\\sigma$.

The diffuse neutrino flux can be subdivided into three components: astrophysical, from extraterrestrial sources; conventional, from pion and kaon decays in atmospheric Cosmic Ray cascades; and the yet undetected prompt component from the decay of charmed hadrons. A particular focus of this work is to test the predicted angular dependence of the atmospheric neutrino flux using an unfolding method. Unfolding is a set of methods aimed at determining a value from related quantities in a model-independent way, eliminating the influence of several assumptions made in the process. In this work, we unfold the muon neutrino energy spectrum and employ a novel technique for rebinning the observable space to ensure sufficient event numbers within the low statistic region at the highest energies.

These atmospheric neutrinos are produced in cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere, mainly by the decay of pions and kaons. The rate of the measured neutrinos is affected by seasonal temperature variations in the stratosphere, which are expected to increase with the energy of the particle. In this contribution, seasonal energy spectra are obtained using a novel spectrum unfolding approach, the Dortmund Spectrum Estimation Algorithm (DSEA+), in which the energy distribution from 125 GeV to 10 TeV is estimated from measured quantities with machine learning algorithms. The seasonal spectral difference to the annual average flux will be discussed based on preliminary results from IceCube's atmospheric muon neutrino data.\n\n", "2307.14689": "2023-07-27, **Multiplicity of TeV muons in extensive air showers detected with IceTop and IceCube**, Stef Verpoest et.al., [2307.14689v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14689v1)\n\n We report on an analysis of the high-energy muon component in near-vertical extensive air showers detected by the surface array IceTop in coincidence with the in-ice array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. In the coincidence measurement, the predominantly electromagnetic signal measured by IceTop is used to estimate the cosmic-ray primary energy, and the energy loss of the muon bundle in the deep in-ice array is used to estimate the number of muons in the shower with energies above 500 GeV (\"TeV muons\"). The average multiplicity of these TeV muons is determined for cosmic-ray energies between 2.5 PeV and 100 PeV assuming three different hadronic interaction models: Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC. For all models considered, the results are found to be in good agreement with the expectations from simulations.

The directional information of the solar origin of the neutrinos is preserved by the fast Cherenkov photons from the neutrino scattered electrons, and is used to discriminate between signal and background. The directional information is independent from the spectral information on which the previous CNO solar neutrino measurements by Borexino were based. While the CNO spectral analysis could only be applied on the Phase-III dataset, the directional analysis can use the complete Borexino data taking period from 2007 to 2021. The absence of CNO neutrinos has been rejected with >5{\\sigma} credible level using the Bayesian statistics. The directional CNO measurement is obtained without an external constraint on the $^{210}$Bi contamination of the liquid scintillator, which was applied in the spectral analysis approach. The final and the most precise CNO measurement of Borexino is then obtained by combining the new CID-based CNO result with an improved spectral fit of the Phase-III dataset. Including the statistical and the systematic errors, the extracted CNO interaction rate is $R(\\mathrm{CNO})=6.7^{+1.2}\\_{-0.8} \\, \\mathrm{cpd/100 \\, tonnes}$.

In this paper, we introduce the TianNu cosmological N-body simulation during the co-evolution of massive neutrino and cold dark matter components via the CUBEP$^3$M code running on the supercomputer Tianhe-2 and TianNu's connected works. We start by analyzing $2.537\\times10^7$ dark halos from the scientific data of TianNu simulation, and compare their angular momentum with the matched halos from neutrino-free TianZero, revealing a dependence of angular momentum modulus on neutrino injection at scales below 50 Mpc and around 10 Mpc.\n\n", "2307.14559": "2023-07-27, **TXS 0506+056 with Updated IceCube Data**, William Luszczak et.al., [2307.14559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14559v1)\n\n Past results from the IceCube Collaboration have suggested that the blazar TXS 0506+056 is a potential source of astrophysical neutrinos.

We explore a cosmological scenario of $F\\_a$ being much larger than $10^{12}$ GeV by considering the axion and moduli dynamics during inflation to set the initial amplitude. We show that if the volume moduli (radion) of the extra-dimension is stabilized mainly by the QCD contribution to the moduli potential during inflation, the QCD axion with the string-scale decay constant obtains a mass around the inflationary Hubble parameter. This means that the axion rolls down to the $\\theta = 0$ minimum during the inflation realizing almost vanishing initial amplitude, and the inflationary quantum fluctuation can be the dominant source of the current number density of axions. We find natural parameter regions where the axion explains the cold dark matter of the Universe, while the constraint on the isocurvature perturbation is avoided. The presence of the axion miniclusters or axion stars are predicted in a wide range of parameters, including the one explains the Subaru-HCS microlensing event.\n\n", "2307.15044": "2023-07-27, **Simulation-guided galaxy evolution inference: A case study with strong lensing galaxies**, Andreas Filipp et.al., [2307.15044v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15044v1)\n\n Understanding the evolution of galaxies provides crucial insights into a broad range of aspects in astrophysics, including structure formation and growth, the nature of dark energy and dark matter, baryonic physics, and more. It is, however, infeasible to track the evolutionary processes of individual galaxies in real time given their long timescales. As a result, galaxy evolution analyses have been mostly based on ensembles of galaxies that are supposed to be from the same population according to usually basic and crude observational criteria. We propose a new strategy of evaluating the evolution of an individual galaxy by identifying its descendant galaxies as guided by cosmological simulations. As a proof of concept, we examined the evolution of the total mass distribution of a target strong lensing galaxy at $z=0.884$ using the proposed strategy. We selected 158 galaxies from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation that we identified as analogs of the target galaxy. We followed their descendants and found 11 observed strong lensing galaxies that match in stellar mass and size with the descendants at their redshifts. The observed and simulated results are discussed, although no conclusive assessment is made given the low statistical significance due to the small sample size. Nevertheless, the test confirms that our proposed strategy is already feasible with existing data and simulations. We expect it to play an even more important role in studying galaxy evolution as more strong lens systems and larger simulations become available with the advent of next-generation survey programs and cosmological simulations.\n\n", "2307.14976": "2023-07-27, **Leading two-loop corrections to the Higgs di-photon decay in the Inert Doublet Model**, Masashi Aiko et.al., [2307.14976v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14976v1)\n\n Leading two-loop contributions to the di-photon decay of the Higgs boson are evaluated for the first time in the Inert Doublet Model (IDM). We employ for this calculation the Higgs low-energy theorem, meaning that we obtain corrections to the Higgs decay process by taking Higgs-field derivatives of the leading two-loop contributions to the photon self-energy. Specifically, we have included purely scalar corrections involving inert BSM Higgs bosons, as well as external-leg contributions involving both the inert scalars and fermions. Our calculation has been performed with a full on-shell renormalization, and in the gauge-less limit. We investigate our results numerically in two scenarios of the IDM: one with a light dark matter (DM) candidate (Higgs resonance scenario), and another with all additional scalars heavy (heavy Higgs scenario). In both cases, we find that the inclusion of two-loop corrections qualitatively modifies the behavior of the decay width, compared with the one-loop ($i.e.$ leading) order, and that they increase the deviation from the Standard Model.

This feature induces additional and qualitatively different interactions of the axion with standard model particles -- quadratic couplings. Previously, hadronic quadratic couplings have been studied and experimental implications have been explored especially in the context of atomic spectroscopy and interferometry. We investigate additional quadratic couplings to the electromagnetic field and electron mass. These electromagnetic quadratic couplings are generated at the loop level from threshold corrections and are expected to be present in the absence of fine-tuning. While they are generally loop-suppressed compared to the hadronic ones, they open up new ways to search for the QCD axion, for instance via optical atomic clocks. Moreover, due to the velocity spread of the dark matter field, the quadratic nature of the coupling leads to low-frequency fluctuations in any detector setup. These distinctive low-frequency fluctuations offer a way to search for heavier axions.

This possibility is particularly interesting for the dark sector, where no restrictions arise based on the weak equivalence principle. In order to implement this idea we consider a scalar field which couples to gravity minimally but via arbitrary functions of the metric determinant. We show that the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar field takes the perfect fluid form when its velocity vector is time-like. We analyze the conservation of this tensor in detail, obtaining a seminal novel result for the energy density of this field in the kinetic dominated regime. Indeed, in this regime the fluid is always adiabatic and we obtain an explicit expression for the speed of sound. Furthermore, to get insight in the gravitational properties of these theories, we consider the fulfillment of the energy conditions, concluding that nontrivial physically reasonable matter violates the strong energy condition in the potential domination regime. On the other hand, we present some shift-symmetric models of particular interest.

We focus on the perturbative regime where the oscillation amplitude is sufficiently small so that parametric resonance is inefficient. This perturbative regime necessarily comprises the late stage of the condensate decay and determines its fate. The coupled coarse-grained equations of motion for the condensate, radiation, and spacetime are derived from first principles using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. We obtain analytical expressions for the relevant microscopic quantities that enter the equations of motion and solve the latter numerically. We find that there is always a nonvanishing relic abundance for a $Z\\_2$-symmetric condensate because its decay rate decreases faster than the Hubble parameter at late times due to either the amplitude-dependence or the temperature-dependence in the condensate decay rate. Consequently, accounting for the condensate contribution to the overall Dark Matter relic density is essential for $Z\\_2$ scalar singlet Dark Matter.
