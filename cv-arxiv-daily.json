Babu et.al., [2410.24125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24125v1)\n\n Left-right symmetric models which employ a generalized seesaw mechanism to generate quark and charged lepton masses are known to solve the strong CP problem via parity symmetry, without the need for the axion. These models lead to naturally light Dirac neutrinos with their masses arising through radiatve corrections. In this work, we show how baryogenesis via Dirac leptogenesis can be implemented in this framework. A pair of left-right symmetric scalar doublets $\\phi\\_{L,R}$ carrying $(B-L)$ charge of $3$ is introduced for this purpose, which preserves the parity solution to the strong CP problem. Small neutrino masses are generated through one-loop diagrams mediated by these scalars. The decay of vector-like leptons ($E\\_i$) involved in the seesaw mechanism to generate charged lepton masses, $E\\_i \\rightarrow \\overline{\\nu}\\_{jR} \\,\\phi\\_R^-$, creates a right-handed neutrino ($\\nu\\_{R}$) asymmetry, while preserving total lepton number. The compensating lepton asymmetry is converted to baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. We show that for a large range of model parameters successful baryogenesis can be realized, with the $W\\_R^\\pm$ gauge boson mass being as low as $10^6$ GeV.\n\n", "2410.24103": "2024-10-31, **Non-holomorphic modular $A_{5}$ symmetry for lepton masses and mixing**, Cai-Chang Li et.al., [2410.24103v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24103v1)\n\n We perform a comprehensive bottom-up study of all the simplest lepton models based on non-holomorphic $A\\_{5}$ modular flavor symmetry, in which neutrinos are assumed to be Majorana particles and their masses are generated by the Weinberg operator or the type I seesaw mechanism. In the case that the generalized CP (gCP) symmetry is not considered, we find that 21 Weinberg operator models and 174 seesaw models can accommodate the experimental data in lepton sector, and all of them depend on six dimensionless free parameters and two overall scales. If gCP symmetry compatible with $A\\_{5}$ modular symmetry is imposed, one more free parameter would be reduced. Then only 4 of the 21 Weinberg operator models and 100 of the 174 seesaw models agree with the experimental data on lepton masses and mixing parameters.

A key component of the upgrade is SuperFGD, a 3D segmented plastic scintillator detector made of approximately 2,000,000 optically-isolated 1 cm3 cubes. It will provide a 3D image of GeV neutrino interactions by combining tracking and stopping power measurements of final state particles with sub-nanosecond time resolution. The performance of SuperFGD is characterized by the precision of its response to charged particles as well as the systematic effects that might affect the physics measurements. Hence, a detailed Geant4 based optical simulation of the SuperFGD building block, i.e. a plastic scintillating cube read out by three wavelength shifting fibers, has been developed and validated with the different datasets collected in various beam tests.

The dark sector comes into thermal equilibrium with Standard Model neutrinos after neutrino decoupling and before recombination via a U(1) gauge interaction in the dark sector. This suppresses the abundance of active neutrinos and therefore reconciles sizeable neutrino masses with cosmology.

The T2K near detector (ND280) upgrade consists of the installation of three new detector systems: a plastic scintillator neutrino active target (Super-FGD), two time projection chambers (HA-TPC) and a time of flight detector (TOF). The Super-FGD is composed of 2-million 1 cm-cube scintillating cubes read by almost 60 thousand wavelength-shifting (WLS) fibers coupled to an MPPC on one end. Given the large number of channels, the limited space inside magnetic environment, and the limited time from production to installation, the development and testing of the Front-end electronics boards (FEB) for the read-out of the Super-FGD channels represented a challenging task for the success of the upgrade. This work presents the performance tests confirming that the FEB aligns with detector requirements, and the hardware qualification of 240 FEBs through a custom QC test bench designed to detect and locate hardware failures to speed up the repairing process. Installation of the electronics in the detector took place in March 2024, one year after the beginning of the FEB mass production, and the first successful neutrino beam run took place in June of the same year.\n\n", "2410.23756": "2024-10-31, **Disentangling data contributions to the precision measurement of the largest leptonic mixing angle**, P. T. Quyen et.al., [2410.23756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23756v1)\n\n Leptonic mixing, together with the massiveness of neutrinos, is one of the most significant discoveries in contemporary particle physics. The observed differences in the mixing patterns of quarks and leptons may shed light on our understanding of the three-generation structure of the Standard Model. This study examines the precise measurement of the largest leptonic mixing angle $\\theta\\_{23}$ through the analysis of neutrino oscillation data samples. Our findings indicate that, contrary to common understanding, the ${\\nu}\\_{\\mu}(\\bar{\\nu}\\_{\\mu})\\rightarrow {\\nu}\\_{e}(\\bar{\\nu}\\_{e})$ appearance samples, rather than the ${\\nu}\\_{\\mu}(\\bar{\\nu}\\_{\\mu})\\rightarrow \\nu\\_{\\mu}(\\bar{\\nu}\\_{\\mu})$ disappearance samples, are sensitive to test the hypothesis of maximal mixing $\\theta\\_{23}=\\pi/4$, particularly if $\\theta\\_{23}$ resides in the higher octant and $\\sin^2\\theta\\_{23}<0.54$. The former serves as the primary source for determining the octant of the $\\theta\\_{23}$ mixing angle; however, the latter remains relevant if $\\theta\\_{23}$ is indeed in the lower octant with $\\sin^2\\theta\\_{23}<0.42$. In a joint T2HK and DUNE analysis, utilizing only appearance sub-samples can exclude the maximal-mixing and determine the actual octant for about 60\\% of the currently allowed range of the $\\theta\\_{23}$ angle.

Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical technique, we probe the parameter space of the model in view of numerous constraints stemming from dark matter, the neutrino sector, and lepton-flavour violating transitions. The dark matter mass distribution of phenomenologically viable scenarios exhibits three very predictive peaks at 550 GeV, 1080 GeV, and 2300 GeV.

In this paper, we identify a surprising connection between quantum entanglement and the degree of quark mixing. Focusing on a specific limit of $2 \\to 2$ quark scattering mediated by electroweak bosons, we find that the quantum entanglement generated by scattering is minimized when the CKM matrix is almost (but not exactly) diagonal, in qualitative agreement with observation. With the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings, additional angles are needed to parametrize the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the lepton sector. Applying the same logic, we find that quantum entanglement is minimized when the PMNS matrix features two large angles and a smaller one, again in qualitative agreement with observation, plus a hint for suppressed CP violation. We speculate on the (unlikely but tantalizing) possibility that minimization of quantum entanglement might be a fundamental principle that determines particle physics input parameters.\n\n", "2410.23258": "2024-10-30, **Subphotospheric Emission from Short Gamma-Ray Bursts.

We solve the transport equations for photons, electrons, protons, neutrinos, and intermediate particles up to the photosphere, accounting for all relevant radiative processes, including electron and proton acceleration, and investigate the potential impact of magnetic reconnection occurring in different regions along the jet. We find the photon spectra undergo non-thermal modifications below the photosphere, observable in both on-axis and off-axis emission directions, as well as across different scenarios of energy dissipation and subsequent particle acceleration. Interestingly, the spectral index of the photon energy distribution can at most vary by $\\sim20\\%$ across all different dissipation scenarios. Depending on the dissipation mechanism at play, neutrino signatures may accompany the photon signal, pointing to efficient proton acceleration and shedding light on jet physics.

A key method for probing this distribution is via weak gravitational lensing mass-mapping - a challenging ill-posed inverse problem where one infers the convergence field from observed shear measurements. Upcoming stage IV surveys, such as those made by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid satellite, will provide a greater quantity and precision of data for lensing analyses, necessitating high-fidelity mass-mapping methods that are computationally efficient and that also provide uncertainties for integration into downstream cosmological analyses. In this work we introduce MMGAN, a novel mass-mapping method based on a regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which generates approximate posterior samples of the convergence field given shear data. We adopt Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability and apply regularisation techniques to overcome mode collapse, issues that otherwise are particularly acute for conditional GANs. We train and validate our model on a mock COSMOS-style dataset before applying it to true COSMOS survey data. Our approach significantly outperforms the Kaiser-Squires technique and achieves similar reconstruction fidelity as alternative state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

A.

High-resolution hydrodynamical simulations are limited to small volumes by their large computational demands, hindering their use for comparisons with wide-field observational surveys. We overcome this limitation by using the First Light and Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of high-resolution (M\\_gas = 1.8 x 10^6 M\\_Sun) zoom simulations drawn from a large, (3.2 cGpc)^3 box. We use an extremely randomised trees machine learning approach to model the relationship between galaxies and their subhaloes in a wide range of environments. This allows us to build mock catalogues with dynamic ranges that surpass those obtainable through periodic simulations. The low cost of the zoom simulations facilitates multiple runs of the same regions, differing only in the random number seed of the subgrid models; changing this seed introduces a butterfly effect, leading to random differences in the properties of matching galaxies. This randomness cannot be learnt by a deterministic machine learning model, but by sampling the noise and adding it post-facto to our predictions, we are able to recover the distributions of the galaxy properties we predict (stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity, and size) remarkably well.

The absence of these operators implies dark baryon dark matter has much smaller cross sections for elastic scattering off nuclei, leading to suppressed direct detection signals. In the confined description, we identify an ``$\\mathcal{H}$-parity'' symmetry that exists in any dark sector with dark quarks transforming under a vector-like representation of a new confining SU($N\\_c$) gauge theory as well as a vector-like representation of the electroweak group SU(2)$\\_L$. The parity is independent of $N\\_c$ and $N\\_f$, though it is essential that the dark quarks are neutral under hypercharge.

To explain this mechanism, we develop a comprehensive model of the Xe-doped LAr scintillation process that integrates both collisional and radiative contributions. Additionally, we investigate how xenon doping affects LAr scintillation light yield and pulse shape discrimination. Finally, we hypothesize that the EUV component may explain the emission of spurious electrons, a known challenge in light dark matter searches using noble liquids.

Large photometric surveys require a substantial improvement in the calibration precision of their photometry to reduce systematic uncertainties in cosmological constraints. The StarDICE experiment is designed to establish accurate broadband flux references for these surveys, aiming for sub-percent precision in magnitude measurements. This requires a precise measurement of the filter bandpasses of both the StarDICE and survey instruments with sub-nanometer accuracy.

The CBP is built from a tunable laser source and a reversed telescope to emit a parallel monochromatic light beam that is continuously monitored in flux and wavelength. The CBP output light flux is measured using a large area photodiode, previously calibrated relative to a NIST photodiode. We derive the StarDICE telescope throughput and filter transmissions from the CBP measurements, anchoring it to the absolute calibration provided by the NIST. After analyzing the systematic uncertainties, we achieved sub-nanometer accuracy in determining filter central wavelengths, measured each filter transmission with a precision of 0.5% per 1nm bin, and detected out-of-band leakages at 0.01%. Furthermore, we have synthesized the equivalent transmission for full pupil illumination from four sample positions in the StarDICE telescope mirror, with an accuracy of approximately 0.2nm for central wavelengths and 7mmag for broadband fluxes. We demonstrated our ability to characterize a telescope throughput down to the mmag, and paved the way for future developments, such as a portable CBP version for in-situ transmission monitoring.\n\n", "2410.24134": "2024-10-31, **Measurement of the power spectrum turnover scale from the cross-correlation between CMB lensing and {\\sl Quaia}**, David Alonso et.al., [2410.24134v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24134v1)\n\n We use the projected clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalog, Quaia, and its cross-correlation with CMB lensing data from Planck, to measure the large-scale turnover of the matter power spectrum, associated with the size of the horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality. The turnover is detected with a significance of between $2.3$ and $3.1\\sigma$, depending on the method used to quantify it. From this measurement, the equality scale is determined at the $\\sim20\\%$ level. Using the turnover scale as a standard ruler alone (discarding information from the large-scale curvature of the power spectrum), in combination with supernova data through an inverse distance ladder approach, we measure the current expansion rate to be $H\\_0=62.7\\pm17.2\\,{\\rm km}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.

We use the code CIGALE that integrates photometric and spectroscopic data. Our analysis reveals a critical transition at Mstar = 10^8.5 MSun, from galaxies dominated by supernovae and AGB stardust, to those dominated by grain growth. This implies a two-mode building of dust mass, supported by model predictions. The detection of stardust galaxies provides a natural and inherent explanation to the excess of UV-bright galaxies at z>10 by JWST. Besides, we observe that the metallicity of galaxies at z>8 presents a metal-to-stellar mass ratio larger than a few 10^-3, above a floor. This suggests a very fast rise of metals at high redshift, impacting the tentative detections of population III objects.\n\n", "2410.23576": "2024-10-31, **On the initial spin periods of magnetars born in weak supernova explosions and their gravitational wave radiation**, Yu-Long Yan et.al., [2410.23576v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23576v1)\n\n The initial spin periods of newborn magnetars are \\textbf{strongly associated with the origin of their strong magnetic fields, both of which can affect the electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves (GWs) emitted at their birth.} Combining the upper limit $E\\_{\\rm SNR}\\lesssim10^{51}$ erg on the explosion energies of \\textbf{the supernova (SN) remnants around slowly-spinning magnetars} with a detailed investigation on the evolution of newborn magnetars, we set constraints on the initial spin periods of magnetars \\textbf{born in weak SN explosions}.

The first eRASS (eRASS1) was completed at solar minimum, when solar wind charge exchange emission was minimal, providing the clearest view of the SXRB. We aim to extract spatial and spectral information from each constituent of the SXRB in the western Galactic hemisphere, focusing on the local hot bubble (LHB). We extracted and analysed eRASS1 spectra from almost all directions in the western Galactic hemisphere by dividing the sky into equal signal-to-noise bins. We fitted all bins with fixed spectral templates of known background constituents. We find the temperature of the LHB exhibits a north-south dichotomy at high latitudes ($\\|b\\|>30^{\\circ}$), with the south being hotter, with a mean temperature at $kT=121.8\\pm0.6\\,$eV and the north at $kT=100.8\\pm0.5\\,$eV.

Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of about 8 solar masses and above explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback present significant bottlenecks in star-by-star galaxy simulations that aim to capture individual stellar dynamics and the inhomogeneous shell expansion of SNe within the turbulent ISM. Our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs, effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale simulations.\n\n", "2410.23336": "2024-10-30, **The Massive and Quiescent Elliptical Host Galaxy of the Repeating Fast Radio Burst FRB20240209A**, T.

Here we present Keck and Gemini observations of the host that reveal a redshift $z=0.1384\\pm0.0004$. We perform stellar population modeling to jointly fit the optical through mid-infrared data of the host and infer a median stellar mass log$(M\\_*/{\\rm M\\_{\\odot}})=11.34\\pm0.01$ and a mass-weighted stellar population age $\\sim11$Gyr, corresponding to the most massive and oldest FRB host discovered to date.

The discovery of a quiescent early-type host galaxy within a transient class predominantly characterized by late-type star-forming hosts is reminiscent of short-duration gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernovae, and ultraluminous X-ray sources. Based on these shared host demographics, coupled with a large offset as demonstrated in our companion paper, we conclude that preferred progenitors for FRB20240209A include magnetars formed through merging binary neutron stars/white dwarfs or the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf, or a luminous X-ray binary. Together with FRB20200120E localized to a globular cluster in M81, our findings provide strong evidence that some fraction of FRBs may arise from a process distinct from the core collapse of massive stars.\n\n", "2410.23190": "2024-10-30, **Diffusive shock acceleration of dust grains at supernova remnants**, P. Cristofari et.al., [2410.23190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23190v1)\n\n Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is a prominent mechanism for energizing charged particles up to very large rigidities at astrophysical collisionless shocks. In addition to ions and electrons, it has been proposed that interstellar dust grains could also be accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration, for instance, at supernova remnants (SNRs). Considering interstellar dust grains of various size and composition, we investigate the possibility of grain acceleration at young SNR shocks (throughout the free expansion and Sedov-Taylor phases) and the maximum energies reached by the accelerated grains. We investigate the potential implications on the abundance of refractory species relative to volatile elements in the cosmic-ray composition. We rely on semi-analytical descriptions of particle acceleration at strong shocks, and on self-similar solutions for the dynamics of SNR shock waves. For simplicity, type Ia thermonuclear SNRs expanding in uniform interstellar medium are considered. We find that the acceleration of dust grains at relativistic speed is possible, up to Lorentz factor of $\\sim 10^{2}$, kinetic energy $E\\_{\\rm k}/\\text{nuc}\\sim 10^2$ GeV/nuc for the smaller grains of size $a\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-7}$ cm.

It is heavily influenced by chemical composition. Observations of distant galaxies and nucleosynthesis calculations show that $\\alpha$-process elements are enriched faster than iron group elements.

By comparing Solar-scaled models to ones enriched in $\\alpha$-process elements, we find that stellar radii, surface temperatures, Main Sequence lifetimes, supernova progenitor properties and supernova rates are all sensitive to changes in [$\\alpha$/Fe]. Lifetimes of low-mass stars differ by up to 0.4 dex, while surface temperatures of massive stars at the end of the Main Sequence also differ by around 0.4 dex. Inferred supernova rates when [Fe/H] is unknown can be highly uncertain. Models with different [$\\alpha$/Fe] but comparable iron abundances show smaller variations, indicating that while iron primarily defines the course of evolution; $\\alpha$-enhancement nonetheless has an impact of up to 0.1 dex on stellar properties. Such changes are small for individual stars, but have a large cumulative effect when considering an entire stellar population as demonstrated by isochrone fitting to nearby clusters.

For spherical problems, such as ideal supernova explosions or stellar wind-blown bubble expansions, simulating only along a radial dimension drastically reduces compute and memory demands compared to a full three-dimensional method. This simplification also alleviates constraints on backpropagation through the solver. Written in JAX, jf1uids is a GPU-compatible and fully differentiable simulator. We demonstrate the advantages of this differentiable physics simulator by retrieving the wind's parameters for an adiabatic stellar wind expansion from the final fluid state using gradient descent. As part of a larger \"stellar winds, cosmic rays and machine learning\" research track, jf1uids serves as a solid foundation to be extended with additional physics modules, foremost cosmic rays and a neural-net powered gas-cooling surrogate and improved by higher order and more accurate numerical schemes.
