Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino oscillations from a stellar object in the two-flavor limit, is extended here to describe the more realistic case where neutrinos can oscillate between three different flavors. The approach is successfully validated against the exact solutions up to eight neutrinos. In all cases where the exact solution is feasible, the PSA provides excellent reproduction of the neutrino oscillation dynamics. By replacing the full problem with a set of simple mean-field equations, the PSA offers a versatile, predictive, and easily parallelizable approach for tackling three-flavor problems. This enables the simulation of large-scale neutrino oscillations, as illustrated here with simulations involving up to 300 neutrinos. Additionally, the method provides insight into the system's equilibration properties.\n\n", "2507.18304": "2025-07-24, **Quark and lepton mixing in the asymptotically safe Standard Model**, Astrid Eichhorn et.al., [2507.18304v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18304v1)\n\n The quark mixing (CKM) matrix is near-diagonal, whereas the lepton mixing (PMNS) matrix is not. We learn that both observations can generically be explained within an ultraviolet completion of the Standard Model with gravity. We find that certain relations between CKM matrix elements should hold approximately because of asymptotically safe regimes, including $\\|V\\_{ud}\\|^2+\\|V\\_{us}\\|^2 \\approx 1$ and $\\|V\\_{cd}\\|^2+\\|V\\_{cs}\\|^2\\approx 1$. Theoretically, the accuracies of these relations determine the length of the asymptotically safe regimes. Experimental data confirms these relations with an accuracy of $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$, respectively. This difference in accuracies is also expected, because the ultraviolet completion consists in a fixed-point cascade during which one relation is established already much deeper in the ultraviolet. This results in $\\|V\\_{ub}\\|^2 < \\|V\\_{cb}\\|^2$ and translates into measurable properties of $B$-mesons.   Similar results would hold for the PMNS matrix, if neutrino Yukawa couplings were large. The ultraviolet complete theory therefore must -- and in fact can -- avoid such an outcome. It contains a mechanism that dynamically limits the size of neutrino Yukawa couplings. Below an upper bound on the sum of Dirac neutrino masses, this allows the PMNS matrix to avoid a near-diagonal structure like the CKM matrix. Thus, large neutrino mixing is intimately tied to small Dirac neutrino masses, $\\sum m\\_{\\nu} \\lesssim {\\mathcal{O}} (1)\\, \\rm eV$ and a mass gap in the Standard Model fermion masses.\n\n", "2507.17908": "2025-07-23, **Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars as high-energy neutrino sources**, Alberto Moretti et.al., [2507.17908v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17908v1)\n\n The astrophysical sources responsible for the production of high energy neutrinos remain largely uncertain. The strongest associations suggest a correlation between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, it is still unclear which specific regions and mechanisms of the accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH) are responsible for their production. In this paper we investigate the correlation between the positions of IceCat-1 neutrino events and a large, optically selected QSO catalog extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Within this sample, we distinguish radio-quiet QSOs from flat-spectrum radio QSOs (FSRQs)based on radio emission data from the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey (CLASS) catalog. While the associations between neutrino events and radio-quiet QSOs are consistent with being all random matches, FSRQs exhibit a moderately significant correlation (2.7 sigma) with neutrino positions. Additionally we observe that the distribution of minimum distances between neutrino events and FSRQs differs significantly for events at declinations above and below 20 deg. In particular, using the KS test, we find that the high-declination event distribution shows a strong deviation (4 sigma) from a random distribution. We interpret all these results as an indication that a large fraction (> 60%) of the neutrino events observed by IceCube could be produced by the FSRQ and that the emission mechanism is likely related to the relativistic jets rather than the \"radio-quiet\" (RQ) component of these sources, such as the accretion disk or corona.\n\n", "2507.17836": "2025-07-23, **Collapsar Disk Outflows III: Detectable Neutrino and Gravitational Wave Signatures**, Rodrigo Fern\u00e1ndez et.al., [2507.17836v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17836v1)\n\n We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.\n\n", "2507.17830": "2025-07-23, **Multiple Populations of Same Sterile Neutrino as Dark Matter**, Muping Chen et.al., [2507.17830v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17830v1)\n\n Sterile neutrinos produced in the early Universe that mix with active neutrinos of the Standard Model are typically considered to consist of a single population resulting from one dominant production mechanism. We show that the same sterile neutrino species can naturally emerge with multiple population components, yielding a multi-modal relic momentum spectrum. We consider this with four distinct production scenarios: active-sterile non-resonant oscillations following resonant oscillations in the presence of a primordial lepton asymmetry, gravitational production through sterile neutrinogenesis from populations of evaporating primordial black holes, and heavy singlet Higgs or inflaton decays combined with non-resonant active-sterile oscillations or neutrinogenesis. We identify sterile neutrino mass ranges where a colder and a hotter population can be present with similar contributions and can also contribute non-negligibly to the dark matter relic abundance. We discuss some potential consequences of such a multi-population framework.\n\n", "2507.17676": "2025-07-23, **Effect of Group-V Impurities on the Electronic Properties of Germanium Detectors: An Insight from First-Principles Calculations**, Sandip Aryal et.al., [2507.17676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17676v1)\n\n The outstanding properties of high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors, such as excellent energy resolution, high energy sensitivity, and a low background-to-signal ratio, make them essential and ideal candidates for detecting particle signatures in nuclear processes such as neutrino-less double beta decay. However, the presence of defects and impurities in HPGe crystals can lead to charge trapping, which affects carrier mobility and results in significant energy resolution degradation. In this work, we employ density functional theory with a hybrid functional to study the energetics of possible point defects in Ge. Our findings indicate that n-type group-V impurities, such as phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), and antimony (Sb), form more readily in Ge compared to nitrogen (N), Ge vacancies, and Ge interstitials. Unlike N dopants, which yield deep trap states, P, As, and Sb create shallow traps close to the conduction band edge of Ge. Furthermore, we predict that n-type defects can condense into defect complexes with Ge vacancies. These vacancy-impurity complexes form deep traps in Ge, similar to Ge vacancies, suggesting that both vacancies and vacancy-impurity complexes contribute to charge trapping in these detectors, thereby diminishing their performance.\n\n", "2507.17425": "2025-07-23, **Readout electronics for low occupancy High-Pressure Gas TPCs**, N.

We present the design of an FPGA-based solution optimised for ND-GAr, which is part of the Phase-II more capable near detector for DUNE. These electronics reduce the cost significantly compared to using collider readout electronics which are typically designed for much higher occupancy and therefore, for example, need much larger numbers of FPGAs and power per channel.

The operation took place between April and July of 2024. We measure the noise characteristics of the system to be sufficiently low and we identify sources of noise that can be further mitigated in the next iteration. We also note that the cooling scheme used in the test requires improvement before full-scale deployment.

Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\\Delta N\\_{\\rm eff} > 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\\sigma$ in the HDE model.

As is well known, resonant cavities are a primary tool in this search, where they are used to enhance the conversion rate of axions into photons in a background electromagnetic field. What is perhaps less well appreciated is that resonant cavities can also enhance the rate at which axions decay to two photons, a manifestation of the Purcell effect. We explore this possibility and show that it offers a novel method to search the axion parameter space in a way that is competitive and complimentary to other approaches, with the capability to probe the most-favoured region for QCD axion dark matter.

Specifically, it is known that at the foam level, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the particular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective dynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the latter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can immediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of the topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this TDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic evolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We confront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with Pantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets. By applying standard model selection methods (AIC and DevIC information criteria), we find a moderate but statistically significant preference over $\\Lambda$CDM scenario.

These models allow black holes to exist while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\\,Sitter and Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands\"), the black hole temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic gamma ray background.\n\n", "2507.18292": "2025-07-24, **The Tremaine-Weinberg method at high redshift**, Mahmood Roshan et.al., [2507.18292v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18292v1)\n\n This paper examines the reliability of the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method in measuring the pattern speed of barred galaxies at high redshifts. Measuring pattern speeds at high redshift may help to shed light on the time evolution of interactions between galactic bars and dark matter halos. The TW method has been extensively employed for nearby galaxies, and its accuracy in determining bar pattern speeds has been validated through numerical simulations. For nearby galaxies, the method yields acceptable results when the inclination angle of the galaxy and the position angle of the bar fall within appropriate ranges. However, the application of the TW method to high-redshift galaxies remains unexplored in both observations and simulations. In this study, we generate mock observations of barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. These simulated observations are tailored to mimic the Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopy data that the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) would capture at a redshift of $z\\simeq 1.2$.

This inference follows when the $w\\_0, w\\_a$ parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w\\_{\\rm de}$ is used to fit the data.

Then we use a $w\\_0, w\\_a$ model for the \\emph{effective} equation of state of dark energy.

A unified PID strategy is developed by combining energy loss measurements (dN/dx) from the time projection chamber (TPC) and time-of-flight (ToF) information from both the inner (ITK) and outer (OTK) silicon trackers. The PID discriminant is constructed using residuals between measured and expected observables under multiple particle hypotheses, with identification regions optimized to maximize kaon efficiency and purity across bins of momentum and polar angle. Results show that the TPC alone, while highly efficient (99.3%), suffers from severe pion-induced contamination, yielding only 14.3% purity. Incorporating ToF from OTK improves the purity to 25.7%. A full combination of ITK, TPC, and OTK significantly enhances performance, achieving 96.8% efficiency and 87.4% purity (product: 84.6%).

In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \\, M\\_{\\odot}$ at high redshifts.

All spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources.

In the Milky Way halo, bound-state formation dominates the flux near 100 GeV. The corresponding low-energy spectrum is used to place constraints based on Fermi-LAT observations of Galactic diffuse emission, while the high-energy part of the spectrum is employed to forecast the required observation time for several of the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal galaxies using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). Fermi-LAT data strongly disfavor the lower edge of the thermal mass window, even under conservative assumptions about the inner Galaxy density profile. Furthermore, several hundred hours of forthcoming CTAO observations of northern dwarfs should be sufficient to probe the central mass value.\n\n", "2507.17794": "2025-07-23, **Accelerating Expansion of the Universe in modified gravity with quadratic terms**, Aaqid Bhat et.al., [2507.17794v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17794v1)\n\n Chapter1 introduces cosmic acceleration and outlines key features and limitations of GR and its alternatives, including teleparallel and symmetric teleparallel gravity.

SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution.

Portals like inelastic axion scattering and axion propagated force have been employed to search for the upper limit of the ALPs' coupling with standard model particles. Other methods, like the axion-fermion interaction in the CASPEr experiment, integrate the dark matter motion into the measurement. We suggest a new method for detecting dark matter axions based on axionelectron elastic scattering. In the pseudoscalar axion model, this interaction can be seen as an effective magnetic field, so high-sensitivity atomic magnetometers can be utilized to measure this interaction. The scattering cross section of this process is significantly amplified by the high number density and occupation number of axion dark matter. The upper limit of the electron-axion coupling coefficient obtained from this process can reach two orders of magnitude higher than previous results at low axion mass, and will exceed the astrophysics limits by using a developing magnetometer.

Anagnostopoulos et.al., [2507.18389v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18389v1)\n\n Using only the standard considerations of spacetime foam and the Euclidean Quantum Gravity techniques known long ago, we result to a model of Topological Dark Energy (TDE) that outperforms the standard $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm with regard to data fitting efficiency. Specifically, it is known that at the foam level, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the particular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective dynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the latter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can immediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of the topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this TDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic evolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We confront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with Pantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets. By applying standard model selection methods (AIC and DevIC information criteria), we find a moderate but statistically significant preference over $\\Lambda$CDM scenario.

Given the central role of the Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in modeling cosmological distances, we investigate here whether these features instead point to a possible departure from the fundamental FLRW symmetries. Exploiting the transverse and line-of-sight distances provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations, we demonstrate that observed distances hint at a slight but systematic preference for an anisotropic expansion rate emerging regardless of the dark energy model considered. Leveraging this non-FLRW feature, we investigate an inhomogeneous extension of the $\\Lambda$CDM model that naturally provides an anisotropic expansion rate. Our analysis demonstrates that models featuring spherical overdensities can explain BAO, supernova, and cosmic microwave background data, providing fits statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with a phantom dark energy scenario. When Pantheon+ data is considered, our analysis challenges the FLRW framework at $2.8\\sigma$ and yields scenarios that can be interpreted as subtle but non-negligible deviations from the FLRW metric. When DESY5 supernovae are considered instead, deviations are notably more significant, yielding scenarios that mildly violate the Copernican principle and exclude the FLRW assumption at $5.2\\sigma$.

Furthermore, most FRB origin models are related to the processes at stellar scales, involving neutron stars, blackholes, supernovae, etc. In this paper, our purpose is to determine whether multi-structural one-off FRBs and repeaters share similarities. To achieve this, we focus on analyzing the relationship between the FRB event rate and the star formation rate, complemented by statistical testing methods. Based on the CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calculate the energy functions for four subsamples, including apparent non-repeating FRBs (one-offs), repeaters, multi-structural one-offs, and the joint repeaters and multi-structural events, respectively. We then derive the FRB event rates at different redshifts for all four subsamples, all of which were found to share a similar cosmological evolution trend.

Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We analyze GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH mass and spin distributions to test possible formation scenarios: first-generation stellar collapse, hierarchical (multi-generation) mergers, and primordial origin. Our analysis strongly prefers scenarios where at least one component is a higher-generation BH. Both components are favored to have high spins, which rules out scenarios in which they are both first-generation (low spin) or primordial (nearly non-spin). We conclude that GW231123 is a hierarchical merger, with components plausibly originate from the successive mergers of $\\sim 6$ and $\\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced.
