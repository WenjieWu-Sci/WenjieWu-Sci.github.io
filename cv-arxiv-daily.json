A successful fit to neutrino oscillation data requires the simultaneous presence of one- and two-loop neutrino mass contributions.

The Standard Model predicts massless neutrinos, and so neutrinos require physics beyond the Standard Model. Other signatures of BSM physics are detectable in modern neutrino facilities -- this chapter explores those possibilities. These can range from new effects modifying neutrino oscillations (beyond the expectations when neutrinos have mass), to searches for new particles in neutrino facilities. Next-generation experiments are particularly powerful for these searches due to high-intensity neutrino beams and novel detection technologies.

Utilizing liquid-argon time-projection chamber technology, DUNE is expected to achieve world-leading sensitivity in the proton decay channels that involve charged kaons in their final states. The first DUNE demonstrator, ProtoDUNE Single-Phase, was a 0.77~kt detector that operated from 2018 to 2020 at the CERN Neutrino Platform, exposed to a mixed hadron and electron test-beam with momenta ranging from 0.3 to 7~GeV/c.

The initial energies of the selected kaon candidates encompass the expected energy range of kaons originating from proton decay events in DUNE (below $\\sim$200~MeV).

In this study, the supersymmetric left-right model is explored to investigate its impact on $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay. Although the process takes place at low energies as compared to the electroweak scale, it carries the potential to provide indirect hints about the parity-breaking scale $\\text{M}\\_R$.

The recoil spectra are affected by interactions between the radioactive implants and the sensor materials. We are therefore developing aluminum-based STJs (Al-STJs) as an alternative to existing tantalum devices (Ta-STJs) to investigate how to separate material effects in the recoil spectrum from potential signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model. Three iterations of Al-STJs were fabricated. The first had electrode thicknesses similar to existing Ta-STJs. They had low responsivity and reduced resolution, but were used successfully to measure $^7$Be nuclear recoil spectra. The second iteration had STJs suspended on thin SiN membranes by backside etching. These devices had low leakage current, but also low yield. The final iteration was not backside etched, and the Al-STJs had thinner electrodes and thinner tunnel barriers to increase signal amplitudes. These devices achieved 2.96 eV FWHM energy resolution at 50 eV using a pulsed 355 nm (~3.5 eV) laser.

The reweighting is based on a Boosted Decision Tree algorithm trained on high-dimensional space in detector final state observables. This enables one generator's events to be reweighted so that its reconstructed particle content and kinematics distributions, as well as detector efficiency, match those of a target model.

Limitations in the theoretical understanding of these interactions typically necessitate ad hoc tuning of simulation model parameters to data. Traditional tuning methods for neutrino experiments have largely relied on simple algorithms for numerical optimization. While adequate for the modest goals of initial efforts, the complexity of future neutrino tuning campaigns is expected to increase substantially, and new approaches will be needed to make progress. In this paper, we examine the application of simulation-based inference (SBI) to the neutrino interaction model tuning for the first time. Using a previous tuning study performed by the MicroBooNE experiment as a test case, we find that our SBI algorithm can correctly infer the tuned parameter values when confronted with a mock data set generated according to the MicroBooNE procedure.

The lightest sterile neutrino ($N\\_1$) serves as a feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP), produced primarily through W and Z boson decays -a previously overlooked dominant contribution that solely determines the relic abundance. Owing to the small vev ($v\\_{\\nu}\\sim 10$ MeV) of the second Higgs doublet, an enhancement in the available parameter space of the sterile neutrino masses is observed, spanning from sub-keV to $0.2$ GeV.

We model the cumulative neutrino flux expected at Earth from all stars in the Milky Way: the Galactic stellar neutrino flux (GS$\\nu$F). We account for the star formation history of our Galaxy and reconstruct the spatial distribution of Galactic stars by means of a random sampling procedure based on Gaia Data Release 2.

Moreover, most of the GS$\\nu$F originates from stars distant from Earth about $5-10$ kpc, implying that a large fraction of stellar neutrinos can reach us from the Galactic Center. Solar neutrinos and the diffuse supernova neutrino background have energies comparable to those of the GS$\\nu$F, challenging the detection of the latter. However, directional information of solar neutrino and GS$\\nu$F events, together with the annual modulation of the solar neutrino flux, could facilitate the GS$\\nu$F detection; this will kick off a new era for low-energy neutrino astronomy, also providing a novel probe to discover New Physics.\n\n", "2510.07236": "2025-10-08, **Texture-zeros in minimal seesaw from non-invertible symmetry fusion rules**, Zheng Jiang et.al., [2510.07236v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07236v1)\n\n The $Z\\_2$ gauging of $Z\\_N$ symmetry can enforce certain elements of the fermion Yukawa couplings to vanish.

We demonstrate that this setup can simultaneously produce an inflaton and baryon asymmetry in the early universe, provide a dark matter candidate and explain the smallness of neutrino masses. The two triplets are particularly important as they become mediators for the production of dark matter and the generation of lepton asymmetry, as well as contribute an inflaton. The inert doublet results in a dark matter candidate. The required CP-violation for lepton asymmetry is obtained by interference between the triplet mediators that communicate the dark sector to the SM sector. More precisely, the complex Breit-Wigner propagators of the triplets and their mixing, result in an asymmetric production of leptons and antileptons that is boosted before dark matter freeze-out. In this case, simultaneously achieving enough dark matter relic abundance and proper matter-antimatter asymmetry limits the available parameter space of the model. Moreover, the scalar triplets are coupled non-minimally to gravity and give rise to the inflaton. We calculate the inflationary parameters and check that we can obtain predictions consistent with Planck constraints from 2018.

The neutrino Hamiltonian has the total spin $J$ and third component $J\\_{\\rm{z}}$ as its only symmetries. The Heisenberg model has these symmetries plus translational invariance and reflection symmetry.   We demonstrate that the convergence of variational methods is dramatically improved by keeping all symmetries. In both cases a nearly exact solution can be obtained in cases where standard unconstrained variational algorithms fail. Since variational algorithms can use standard Trotter steps as part of the optimization, allowing additional correlations that obey all the symmetries of the Hamiltonian will speed convergence of variational algorithms. This will lead to faster convergence than standard projection algorithms.\n\n", "2510.06665": "2025-10-08, **Doping of a Borexino-like Liquid Scintillator with Tellurium-Diols**, Hans Th. J.

Therefore,a novel and completely water-free synthesis in a non-acidic organic environment at room temperature was used.

Both the emission spectrum and transmission remained nearly unchanged,even at high doping levels. The reduction in light yield was moderate, with approximately 8,400 photons emitted for a 1 MeV energy deposition by an electron at 1$\\%$ tellurium loading.

We find the full electron-scattering response at leading order is captured by 5 structure factors and identify the leading component with the electron energy-loss function. Then, using silicon and germanium detectors as an example, we perform a dark matter sensitivity study and compute their respective neutrino floors.

However, astrophysical black holes are usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on (near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.\n\n", "2510.08331": "2025-10-09, **The superclustering of hot gas: cosmological sensitivity in the Websky simulations**, M.

Standard cross-correlations measure a directionless correlation between the microwave maps and galaxy catalogs. However, more information about the cosmic web structure can be captured by summary statistics which include environmental constraints and measure oriented correlations along axes of structure, such as filaments or superclusters. This work studies the sensitivity of multipole moments of constrained oriented stacks, a directional and environmentally-dependent statistic, to variations in cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We run nine different 2.4 Gpc-per-side simulations with the Websky algorithm, varying the dark matter energy density within flat $\\Lambda$CDM, and create mock tSZ maps with each. We also apply six different gas prescriptions, imitating AGN feedback variations, to the fiducial cosmology.

The spatial distribution of satellite galaxies about central galaxies and correspondingly, the spatial distribution of subhaloes about host haloes have been subjects of interest for two decades. Important questions include the degree to which satellites are distributed anisotropically about their hosts or exhibit planarity in their distributions and the degree to which this anisotropy depends upon the environment of the host-satellite system. We study the spatial distributions of subhaloes in a cosmological N-body simulation. We find that CDM subhaloes are distributed in a manner that is strongly anisotropic/planar, in agreement with prior work, though our presentation is complementary. The more novel result is that this anisotropy has an environmental dependence. Systems which exhibit less (more) anisotropy and less (more) planarity cluster more strongly (weakly). Systems in which subhaloes reside further from their host centres cluster more weakly. None of these clustering effects are caused by a correlation between subhalo anisotropy/planarity and other properties on which host halo clustering is known to depend, such as concentration, spin parameter, host halo shape, or subhalo count.

By varying the DM particle mass and considering different core compositions including hypernuclear matter, sexaquark DM, and deconfined quark matter (QM), we construct hybrid equations of state (EOS) with a smooth hadron--quark crossover that remain consistent with current astrophysical constraints on mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Our analysis shows that the presence of these exotic components systematically alters quasi-universal $f$-mode relations. In particular, relations involving $f$--$\\sqrt{M/R^{3}}$, $(R^{4}/M^{3}\\tau)(C)$, $\\omega M(C)$, require higher-order polynomial fits compared to standard studies. Quadratic forms remain sufficient for $f$--$\\sqrt{M/R^{3}}$ and $\\omega M(C)$, while damping-time relations such as $(R^{4}/M^{3}\\tau)(C)$ demand higher-order corrections to capture their curvature.

Our numerical analysis shows that the spectrum of produced particles has a peak at low momenta corresponding to the horizon scale. If the emitted NG bosons acquire mass due to soft-breaking terms, they can take the role of dark matter.

Existing tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise, are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes, handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our model achieves a speedup of over 200$\\times$ compared to classical simulators for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency.

However, survey systematics such as variations in seeing and sky brightness can also induce artificial fluctuations in the observed densities of known stellar streams. These variations arise because survey conditions affect both object detection and star-galaxy misclassification rates. To mitigate these effects, we use Balrog synthetic source injections in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data to calculate detection rate variations and classification rates as functions of survey properties. We show that these rates are nearly separable with respect to survey properties and can be estimated with sufficient statistics from the synthetic catalogs. Applying these corrections reduces the standard deviation of relative detection rates across the DES footprint by a factor of five, and our corrections significantly change the inferred linear density of the Phoenix stream when including faint objects. Additionally, for artificial streams with DES like survey properties we are able to recover density power spectra with reduced bias. We also find that uncorrected power-spectrum results for LSST-like data can be around five times more biased, highlighting the need for such corrections in future ground based surveys.\n\n", "2510.07490": "2025-10-08, **Apparent Lorentz violation from disformally coupled ultralight dark matter**, Guillem Dom\u00e8nech et.al., [2510.07490v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07490v1)\n\n We study the impact of general disformal metric transformations on fermions, which shift the gravitational metric by an additional rank-2 tensor.

We show this transformation results in the conventional Dirac action being modified by additional kinetic and axial-current couplings that are quadratic in the shifted field. When the field sourcing the metric shift takes on a non-trivial background value, apparent Lorentz-violating effects can result, which we identify as terms in an effective field theory.

Many different cosmological scenarios have been proposed that establish the abundance of axion DM in qualitatively different ways. In this paper we emphasize that, despite this variety of backgrounds, the perturbations in axion DM can be understood from universal principles. How does a feebly interacting axion field acquire perturbations proportional to those of photons? How do the isocurvature power spectrum and non-Gaussianity depend on the background evolution of the universe? We answer these questions for a completely general choice of cosmological background and temperature-dependent axion potential. We show that the most general solution to the axion field equation on super-horizon scales is entirely determined by the family of background solutions for different initial field values $\\theta\\_{\\rm ini}$. This holds for both the component in the field perturbation solution contributing to the DM isocurvature perturbation (enhanced at late times by the sensitivity of the DM abundance to the initial condition, $\\partial \\Omega\\_a / \\partial \\theta\\_{\\rm ini}$, which can be large for initial conditions near the hilltop), and the other component that contributes to the DM curvature perturbation. In particular, we explain that an unperturbed axion field in the early universe evolving into one with nontrivial adiabatic perturbations is guaranteed by Weinberg's theorem on adiabatic modes. These results have been derived before with various assumptions, such as a radiation dominated background or a quadratic potential. Our aim is to give a clear, simple derivation that is manifestly independent of those assumptions, and thus can be applied to any cosmological axion scenario.\n\n", "2510.07103": "2025-10-08, **Unified Dark Matter and Dark Energy in a model of Non-Canonical Scalar-Tensor Theory**, Nihal Jalal Pullisseri et.al., [2510.07103v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07103v1)\n\n We consider a model of non-canonical scalar-tensor theory in which the kinetic term in the Brans-Dicke action is replaced by a non-canonical scalar field Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}(X, \\phi)= \\lambda X^\\alpha \\phi^\\beta - V(\\phi)$ where $X = (1/2) \\partial\\_{\\mu} \\phi \\partial^{\\mu} \\phi$ and $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ and $\\lambda$ are parameters of the model.

We use stellar line-of-sight velocities and the Jeans modelling code GravSphere to infer the mass distributions of these galaxies, allowing us to compute the RAR. We compare the results with the EDGE simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies with similar stellar masses in a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that most of the observed dwarf galaxies lie systematically above the low-mass extrapolation of the RAR. Each galaxy traces a locus in the RAR space that can have a multi-valued observed acceleration for a given baryonic acceleration, while there is significant scatter from galaxy to galaxy. Our results indicate that the RAR does not apply to low-mass dwarf galaxies and that the inferred baryonic acceleration of these dwarfs does not contain enough information, on its own, to derive the observed acceleration. The simulated EDGE dwarfs behave similarly to the real data, lying systematically above the extrapolated RAR. We show that, in the context of modified weak-field gravity theories, these results cannot be explained by differential tidal forces from the Milky Way, nor by the galaxies being far from dynamical equilibrium, since none of the galaxies in our sample seems to experience strong tides. As such, our results provide further evidence for the need for invisible dark matter in the smallest dwarf galaxies.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2510.08505": "2025-10-09, **AT 2018cow at ~5 years: additional evidence for a tidal disruption origin**, Anne Inkenhaag et.al., [2510.08505v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08505v1)\n\n The Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT) AT 2018cow is the prototype of its class with an extensive set of multi-wavelength observations.

We present additional late time UV data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, to show there is no significant fading in the optical since the last epoch and only marginal fading in the UV. The new UV data points match the predictions of previously published accretion disk models, where the disk is assumed to form from the tidal disruption of a low mass star by an intermediate mass black hole. This consistency provides evidence that AT 2018cow could indeed be a tidal disruption event. The marginal decay is in contrast with the predictions of light curves produced by interacting supernovae.

From these, we identified the population of MCs using hierarchical clustering and analysed them to provide insights into the interpretation of observed MCs as they evolve. The flux distributions of the post-processed synthetic observations and the properties of the MCs, namely radius, mass, velocity dispersion, virial parameter and surface density, are consistent with those of SEDIGISM. Both samples of MCs occupy the same regions in the scaling relation plots; however, the average distributions of MCs at different evolutionary stages do not overlap on the plots. This highlights the reliability of our approach in modelling SEDIGISM and suggests that MCs at different evolutionary stages contribute to the scatter in observed scaling relations. We study the trends in MC properties over time to analyse their physical structure as they evolve. MCs appear as small, diffuse cloudlets in early stages, followed by their evolution to filamentary structures, before being shaped by stellar feedback into 3D bubbles and getting dispersed. These trends in the observable properties of MCs provide strong evidence that clouds exhibit distinct morphologies over the course of their evolution.\n\n", "2510.07131": "2025-10-08, **CURLING -- II.
