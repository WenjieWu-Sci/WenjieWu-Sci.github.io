We focus on new flavor-dependent long-range neutrino interactions mediated by ultra-light mediators, with masses below $10^{-10}$ eV, introduced by new lepton-number gauge symmetries $L\\_e-L\\_\\mu$, $L\\_e-L\\_\\tau$, and $L\\_\\mu-L\\_\\tau$. Because the interaction range is ultra-long, nearby and distant matter - primarily electrons and neutrons - in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and the local Universe, may source a large matter potential that modifies neutrino oscillation probabilities. The upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and the Tokai-to-Hyper-Kamiokande (T2HK) long-baseline neutrino experiments will provide an opportunity to search for these interactions, thanks to their high event rates and well-characterized neutrino beams. We forecast their probing power. Our results reveal novel perspectives. Alone, DUNE and T2HK may strongly constrain long-range interactions, setting new limits on their coupling strength for mediators lighter than $10^{-18}$ eV. However, if the new interactions are subdominant, then both DUNE and T2HK, together, will be needed to discover them, since their combination lifts parameter degeneracies that weaken their individual sensitivity. DUNE and T2HK, especially when combined, provide a valuable opportunity to explore physics beyond the Standard Model.\n\n", "2305.05135": "2023-05-09, **Search for astrophysical electron antineutrinos in Super-Kamiokande with 0.01wt% gadolinium loaded water**, M.

In June 2020, gadolinium was introduced to the ultra-pure water of the SK detector in order to detect neutrons more efficiently. In this new experimental phase, SK-Gd, we can search for electron antineutrinos via inverse beta decay with efficient background rejection and higher signal efficiency thanks to the high efficiency of the neutron tagging technique.

This will become a very challenging background to dark matter discovery in planned future detectors. For dark matter with mass above 10 GeV, the dominant neutrino backgrounds on the Earth are atmospheric neutrinos created by cosmic ray collisions with the atmosphere. In contrast, the Moon has almost no atmosphere and nearly all cosmic rays incident on the Moon first collide with the lunar surface, producing a very different neutrino spectrum. In this work we estimate the total flux and spectrum of neutrinos near the surface of the Moon. We then use this to show that a large-scale liquid xenon or argon detector located on the Moon could potentially have significantly greater sensitivity to dark matter compared to an equivalent detector on the Earth due to effectively reduced neutrino backgrounds.\n\n", "2305.04916": "2023-05-08, **Neutrino many-body correlations**, Lucas Johns et.al., [2305.04916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04916v1)\n\n This paper responds to suggestions that the standard approach to collective neutrino oscillations leaves out potentially important quantum many-body correlations.

Our simulation follows the evolution of cosmic-ray (CR) particle spectra with energy losses and the stochastic turbulence acceleration. We find that the reacceleration is essential to explain the observed radio properties of head-tail galaxies, in which the radio flux and spectral index do not drastically change. Our models suggest that hard X-ray emissions can be detected around the head-tail galaxy in the Perseus cluster by the hard X-ray satellites, such as FORCE, and it will potentially constrain the acceleration efficiency. We also explore the origin of the collimated synchrotron threads, which are found in some head-tail galaxies by recent high-quality radio observations. Thin and elongated flux tubes, connecting the two tails, are formed by strong backflows at an early phase. We find that these threads advect with the wind for over 300 Myr without disrupting. The radio flux from the flux tubes is much lower than the typical observed flux. An efficient CR diffusion process along the flux tubes, however, may solve this discrepancy.\n\n", "2305.04681": "2023-05-08, **Minimal model inspired by family number and dark matter**, Duong Van Loi et.al., [2305.04681v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04681v1)\n\n We consider a gauge symmetry extension of the standard model given by $SU(3)\\_C\\otimes SU(2)\\_L\\otimes U(1)\\_X\\otimes U(1)\\_N\\otimes Z\\_2$ with minimal particle content, where $X$ and $N$ are family dependent but determining the hypercharge as $Y=X+N$, while $Z\\_2$ is an exact discrete symmetry.

Using a self-interacting dark matter (DM) model based on the neutron decay anomaly and a hadronic model obtained from the posterior distribution of a recent Bayesian analysis, we impose constraints on the DM self-interaction strength using recent multimessenger astrophysical observations. The constrained DM interaction strength is then used to estimate DM self-interaction cross section and shear viscosity resulting from DM, which is found to be several orders of magnitude smaller than shear viscosity due to hadronic matter. Assuming that the DM fermion is in chemical equilibrium with the neutrons in the neutron star, we estimate the bulk viscosity resulting from the dark decay of neutrons, and find it to be much smaller than the hadronic bulk viscosity.

Owing to the large mass of the black hole, and resulting large velocity dispersion for the dark matter particles in the spike, it is possible for Fermi-LAT and MAGIC data to place tight constraints on $p$-wave annihilation, which would be far more stringent than those placed by observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Indeed, for optimistic choices of the spike parameters, gamma-ray data would exclude thermal $p$-wave dark matter models with a particle mass $\\lesssim {10}~\\rm TeV$. But there is significant uncertainty in the properties and parameters of the spike, and for less optimistic scenarios, thermal dark matter candidates would be completely unconstrained.

While dark matter of this type and scale would not leave appreciable nuclear recoil signals, it may instead induce ionization of atomic electrons. Accurate modelling of the atomic wavefunctions is key to investigating this possibility, with incorrect treatment leading to a large suppression in the atomic excitation factors. We have calculated these atomic factors for argon, krypton and xenon and present the tabulated results for use with a range of dark matter models. This is made possible by the separability of the atomic and dark matter form factor, allowing the atomic factors to be calculated for general couplings; we include tables for vector, scalar, pseudovector, and pseudoscalar electron couplings. Additionally, we calculate electron impact total ionization cross sections for xenon using the tabulated results as a test of accuracy.

Major challenges for achieving this goal include eliminating, or mitigating, the impact of the baryonic components and tidal effects within the dark matter halos of interest -- the effects of these processes can be highly degenerate with those of dark matter self-interactions at small scales. In this work we select 9 isolated galaxies and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with baryonic components small enough such that the baryonic gravitational potentials do not significantly influence the halo gravothermal evolution processes.

The mechanism is based on the presence of remnants dominated by the false vacuum that scale slower with the expansion of the Universe than their surroundings where this energy was already converted into radiation. We compute the PBH formation from these remnants including the contribution from the false vacuum and the bubble walls, by estimating the collapse using the hoop conjecture and by considering both regions collapsing immediately when entering the horizon and sub-horizon regions that collapse as their compactness grows.

One proposal is to dope a liquid noble-element direct detection experiment with a lighter element such as hydrogen. This has the advantage of enabling larger recoil energies compared to scattering on a heavy target, while leveraging existing detector technologies. Direct detection experiments can also extend their reach to lower masses by exploiting the Migdal effect, where a nuclear recoil leads to electronic ionisation or excitation. In this work we combine these ideas to study the sensitivity of a hydrogen-doped LZ experiment (HydroX), and a future large-scale experiment such as XLZD. We find that HydroX could have sensitivity to dark matter masses as low as 5~MeV for both spin-independent and spin-dependent scattering, with XLZD extending that reach to lower cross sections.

The cosmic variance from the finite simulation volume is discussed. By measuring the MFs from the density field of dark matter with different smoothing scales and at different redshifts, we systematically evaluate how much information can be extracted from the MFs in these situations, and try to combine them to improve the constraint. Furthermore, we study the MG signatures imprinted in the MFs of the large-scale structures (LSS) when the biased tracer -- dark matter halo -- is used. And find the response to the fifth force is different from the matter. We also study how the constraints on modified gravity parameters change when using biased tracers of LSS.

Such stars are captured in the vicinity of the black hole and enhance the expected collision rate.

Therefore, their abundances can unravel the recent star formation history of the host galaxy. In view of future gamma-ray surveys, we predict the masses and fluxes of these two elements in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using new chemical evolution models. Our best model reproduces the abundance patterns of alpha/Fe ratios, the gas mass, the average metallicity, the present time supernova and nova rates observed in LMC. We show three main results: i) the best model for the LMC suggests a star formation rate very mild at the beginning with a recent burst, and a Salpeter-like initial mass function. ii) The predicted mass of 26Al is 0.33 M\\_Sun, 2/3 produced by massive stars and 1/3 by novae. iii) The predicted mass of 60Fe is 0.44 M\\_Sun, entirely produced by massive stars.

Notably, the knots in the NE jet are mostly 'S-rich' with weak or no [P II] lines, implying that they originated below the explosive Ne burning layer, consistent with the results of previous studies. We detected no ejecta knots exhibiting only [Fe II] lines in the NE jet area that are expected in the jet-driven SN explosion model. Instead, we discovered a dozen 'Fe-rich' knots in the Fe K plume area.
