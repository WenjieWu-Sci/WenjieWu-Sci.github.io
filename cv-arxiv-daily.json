Sa\u00e1-Hern\u00e1ndez et.al., [2401.09920v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09920v1)\n\n Next-generation megawatt-scale neutrino beams open the way to studying neutrino-nucleus scattering resorting, for the first time, to gaseous targets. This could lead to deeper knowledge of neutrino cross sections in the energy region between hundreds of MeV and a few GeV, of interest for the upcoming generation of long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. The challenge is, therefore, to accurately track and (especially) time the particles produced in neutrino interactions in large and seamless volumes down to few-MeV energies. We propose to accomplish this through an optically-read time projection chamber (TPC) filled with high-pressure argon and equipped with both tracking and timing functions. In this work, we present a detailed study of the time-tagging capabilities of such a device, based on end-to-end optical simulations that include the effect of photon propagation, photosensor response, dark-count rate and pulse reconstruction. We show that the neutrino interaction time could be reconstructed from the primary-scintillation signal with a precision in the range 1--2.5~ns ($\\sigma$) for point-like deposits with energies down to 5~MeV, and well below 1~ns for minimum-ionizing particle tracks. A discussion on previous limitations towards such a detection technology, and how they can be realistically overcome in the near future thanks to recent developments in the field, is presented (particularly the strong scintillation yields recently reported for Ar/CF$\\_4$ mixtures). The performance presented in our analysis seems to be well within reach of next-generation neutrino-oscillation experiments through the instrumentation of the proposed TPC with conventional reflective materials and a SiPM carpet behind a transparent cathode.\n\n", "2401.09837": "2024-01-18, **Prototyping a High Purity Germanium cryogenic veto system for a bolometric detection experiment**, Chlo\u00e9 Goupy et.al., [2401.09837v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09837v1)\n\n The use of High Purity Germanium detectors operated in ionization mode at cryogenic temperatures is investigated as an external background mitigation solution for bolometers used in rare-event search experiments. A simple experimental setup with very partial coverage, running a 52-g $\\mathrm{Li\\_2WO\\_4}$ bolometer sandwiched in-between two 2-cm thick High Purity Germanium cylindrical detectors in a dry cryostat, shows promising rejection to environmental gammas and atmospheric muons backgrounds.

In this work, we use Bayesian inference applied to the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) galaxies' rotation curves to see which hypothesis fares better. For this, we represent DM by two widely used cusped and cored profiles, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Burkert. We parameterize MOND by a widely used radial-acceleration relation (RAR). Our results show a preference for the cored DM profile with high Bayes factors in a substantial fraction of galaxies. Interestingly enough, MOND is typically preferred by those galaxies which lack precise rotation curve data. Our study also confirms that the choice of prior has a significant impact on the credible interval of the characteristic MOND acceleration. Overall, our analysis comes out in favor of dark matter.\n\n", "2401.10116": "2024-01-18, **Interpreting deviations between AR-VTG and GR**, Roberto Dale et.al., [2401.10116v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10116v1)\n\n The Cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies predicted by two cosmological models are compared, one of them is the standard model of general relativity with cold dark matter and cosmological constant, whereas the second model is based on a consistent vector-tensor theory of gravitation explaining solar system and cosmological observations. It is proved that the resulting differences -- between the anisotropies of both models -- are due to the so-called late integrated Sachs Wolfe effect and, consequently, cross correlations between maps of CMB temperatures and tracers of the dark matter distribution could be used in future to select one of the above models.

Density fluctuations across the finite survey volume induce noise to this measure, often referred to as Super-Sample Covariance (SSC). In the past for unbinned cluster analysis such noise has not been included in the cluster likelihood. In this paper, we present a derivation of the unbinned likelihood accounting for Super-Sample Covariance by using a Gauss-Poisson Compound (GPC) likelihood. We show that deriving the unbinned likelihood with SSC from the expansion of the GPC formalism to the second order in density perturbation is not sufficient, preventing us from using analytical methods already explored in the literature. In order to solve this issue, we still used the GPC model to derive an alternative \"hybrid\" likelihood, by using standard redshift bins. Using simulated dark matter halo catalog obtained by the PINOCCHIO algorithm, we found that the hybrid likelihood, accounting for both Poisson noise and SSC, increases the dispersion of the parameter posteriors by 25 per cent using 2,500 clusters, compared to the standard Poisson likelihood.\n\n"}, "supernova": {"2401.09729": "2024-01-18, **Initial state of the recombining plasma in supernova remnant W 28**, Rui Himono et.al., [2401.09729v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09729v1)\n\n We investigate an SNR W28 with the Suzaku archive data and report the results of spatial resolved analyses.
