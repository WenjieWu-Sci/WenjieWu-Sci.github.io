Such a matter-domination epoch gives rise to peculiar spectral imprints on primordial Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced during inflation. We point out that the characteristic spectral features are detectable in multiple frequency bands with current and future GW experiments in case of Blue GWs (BGWs) described by a power-law with a positive spectral index $(n\\_T >0)$ and an amplitude compatible with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements. We find that the three-flavour leptogenesis regime with $M\\_N \\lesssim 10^9~{\\rm GeV}$ imprints BGWs more prominently than the two-flavour and one-flavour regimes characterized by a higher right-neutrino mass scale. In particular, a two-flavour (three-flavour) leptogenesis regime is expected to leave distinct imprints in the mHz ($\\mu$Hz) band. Moreover, we translate the current Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and LIGO limits on the GW energy density into constraints on the flavour leptogenesis parameter space for different GW spectral index $n\\_T$. Interestingly, a three-flavour leptogenesis regime can offer a unique signal testable in the next LIGO run with a correlated signature in the PTA frequency band with an amplitude comparable to the one expected from supermassive black holes.\n\n", "2405.00272": "2024-05-01, **Search for charged lepton flavor violation in $J/\u03c8$ decays at BESIII**, Xudong Yu et.al., [2405.00272v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00272v1)\n\n In the Standard Model, charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) is heavily suppressed by tiny neutrino mass, while many theoretical models can enhance CLFV effects up to detectable level.

These ''exploding'' black holes will release a burst of Standard Model particles alongside any additional degrees of freedom, should they exist. We explore the possibility that heavy neutral leptons (HNL), mixing with active neutrinos, are emitted in the final evaporation stages. We calculate the expected number of active neutrinos from such an event, including contributions due to the HNL decay for different assumptions on the mixings. We infer sensitivities on the active-sterile neutrino mixing and on the sterile neutrino mass, finding that, for instance, for the scenario where $U\\_{\\tau 4}\\neq 0$, IceCube could improve current constraints by $\\sim 2$ orders of magnitude, for HNLs masses between 0.1 - 1 GeV, for a PBH at a distance of $\\sim 10^{-4}$ pc from Earth.\n\n", "2405.00119": "2024-04-30, **Sterile neutrino dark matter within the $\u03bd$SMEFT**, Kaori Fuyuto et.al., [2405.00119v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00119v1)\n\n Sterile neutrinos with masses at the $\\mathrm{keV}$ scale and mixing to the active neutrinos offer an elegant explanation of the observed dark matter (DM) density. However, the very same mixing inevitably leads to radiative photon emission and the non-observation of such peaked $X$-ray lines rules out this minimal sterile neutrino DM hypothesis.

Investigating whether there is a correlation between the gamma-ray and neutrino observations can help us identify high-energy neutrino sources and determine which sources are the main contributors to the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux of IceCube. In previous work, we have already studied the possible gamma-neutrino correlations by analyzing 10 years of IceCube muon-track data. In this work, we further investigate such correlations by employing the IceCube p-value sky map of the scan for point sources. We examine the spatial associations of hotspots in the neutrino sky map with various gamma-ray source samples: the third Fermi-LAT catalog of high-energy sources (3FHL), LAT 14-year source catalog (4FGL), the fourth catalog of active galactic nuclei (4LAC) and subsets of these samples. Among all the samples, the 3FHL sample shows a possible correlation with the neutrino hotspots, with a pre-trial p-value of $1.1\\times10^{-4}$ ($\\sim 3.9\\,\\sigma$).

Incorporating the latest cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and laboratory measurements on oscillations, we determine the sum of neutrino masses for both the normal hierarchy (NH) and the inverted hierarchy (IH).

Utilizing these constraints, we calculate the effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH scenarios, establishing the corresponding allowed regions. Importantly, we find that the minimum neutrino mass is non-zero, as constrained by the current oscillation parameters. Additionally, we estimate the half-life of 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay using these effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH.

However, they are highly decoupled from the SM and difficult to probe. In this work, we consider the Majorana RHNs from the type-I seesaw mechanism may well mix with the heavy neutral lepton dwelling in certain vector-like lepton (VLL), thus acquiring a sizable electroweak charge. Such a simple scenario yields many interesting consequences, and the imprint on oblique corrections, well expected from the mass splitting between components of VLL by virtue of VLL-RHN mixing, is our focus here. We analytically calculate the Peskin-Takeuchi parameters S, T and U with full details, carefully treating the Majorana loop to obtain the self consistent expressions free of divergence. Then, we constrain on the VLL-RHN system which only gives a sizable $T$ parameter using the PDG-2021 data and CDF-II data, separately, by imposing $T\\lesssim{\\cal O}(0.1)$.

We demonstrate that the decay of dark photons, with masses ranging from 200 to 400 MeV, can lead to the emission of neutrinos with energies surpassing those emitted by supernovae. These neutrinos therefore serve as a distinct signal of new physics, allowing for the exploration of previously uncharted regions of the dark photon parameter space and complementing both accelerator-based searches and other astrophysical constraints. The signal is largely unaffected by the specifics of the supernova's temperature and density radial profiles outside the SN core, rendering the prediction both robust and model-independent.

It is based on forward modelling to deal with convolution by a point spread function with comparable size to many galaxies; sampling the posterior distribution of galaxy parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo; and marginalisation over nuisance parameters for each of the 1.5 billion galaxies observed by Euclid. The scientific performance is quantified through high-fidelity images based on the Euclid Flagship simulations and emulation of the Euclid VIS images; realistic clustering with a mean surface number density of 250 arcmin$^{-2}$ ($I\\_{\\rm E}<29.5$) for galaxies, and 6 arcmin$^{-2}$ ($I\\_{\\rm E}<26$) for stars; and a diffraction-limited chromatic point spread function with a full width at half maximum of $0.^{\\!\\prime\\prime}2$ and spatial variation across the field of view.

Bartlett et.al., [2405.00635v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00635v1)\n\n Bias models relating the dark matter field to the spatial distribution of halos are widely used in cosmological analyses. Many such models predict halos purely from the local matter density, an assumption which has not been verified in a model-agnostic setting. Bias models in perturbation theory require the inclusion of other local properties, but it is not clear whether this extends to non-perturbative approaches. We assess the validity of the assumption that only the local dark matter density can be used to predict the number density of halos in a model-independent way and in the non-perturbative regime. Utilising $N$-body simulations, we introduce a test wherein we study the properties of the halo counts field after spatial voxels with near-equal dark matter density have been permuted. If local-in-matter-density (LIMD) biasing were valid, the statistical properties of the permuted and un-permuted fields would be indistinguishable since both are equally fair draws of the stochastic biasing model. For voxels of side length $\\sim4-60\\,h^{-1}{\\rm\\,Mpc}$ and for halos less massive than $\\sim10^{15}\\,h^{-1}{\\rm\\,M\\_\\odot}$, the permuted halo field has significantly too much power on large scales compared to the truth. We interpret this as due to LIMD models removing small-scale power by not modelling correlations between neighbouring voxels. Since the permutation conserves the total variance of the halo counts field, large-scale power is substantially boosted to compensate. This conclusion is robust to the choice of initial conditions and cosmology. LIMD halo biasing cannot, therefore, reproduce the distribution of halos across a large range of scales and halo masses, no matter how complex the model. To reproduce this distribution accurately, one must allow the biasing to be a function of other quantities and/or remove the assumption that neighbouring voxels are statistically independent.\n\n", "2405.00207": "2024-04-30, **Primordial Black Hole Formation in a Dust Bouncing Model**, E.

We compute the critical density contrast that describes the collapse of matter perturbations in the flat-dust bounce model with a parametric solution, obtained from the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric that represents the spherical collapse. We discuss the inability of the Newtonian gauge to describe perturbations in contracting models as the perturbative hypothesis does not hold in such cases. We carry the calculations for a different Gauge choice and compute the perturbations power spectra numerically. Finally, assuming a Gaussian distribution, we compute the primordial black hole abundance with the Press-Schechter formalism and compare it with observational constraints.

Both $\\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\\texttt{turboGL}$ perform well in modeling the weak-lensing region influenced by mildly nonlinear structures.

During cluster collisions, SIDM spreads out and lags behind cluster member galaxies. Individual systems can have quirky dynamics that makes them difficult to interpret. Statistically, however, we find that the mean or median of dark matter's spatial offset in many collisions can be robustly modelled, and is independent of our viewing angle and halo mass even in collisions between unequal-mass systems.

This criterion reads $Q\\_{\\rm3D}<1$, where $Q\\_{\\rm3D}$ is the 3D analogue of the Toomre parameter $Q$. The advantage of $Q\\_{\\rm3D}$ is that it allows us to study LGI in and above the galaxy midplane in a rigorous and self-consistent way.

The sample is representative of galaxies on the main sequence at $\\mathrm{z}\\approx 0$ and includes massive star-forming and starburst galaxies at $1\\lesssim\\mathrm{z}\\lesssim5$.

We compare our model projections with the most current constraints and show that the IceCube detector can detect CR-boosted dark matter especially with masses below $\\sim$ 100 keV when scattering with electrons and $\\sim$ MeV in the nucleon scattering case.\n\n", "2405.00090": "2024-04-30, **Can the QCD axion feed a dark energy component?**, Kristjan M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp et.al., [2405.00090v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00090v1)\n\n A pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB) coupled to a confining gauge group via an anomalous term is characterised, during the confining phase transition, by a temperature dependent mass $m^2(T) \\propto T^{-n}$.

We study the local DM velocity distribution based on these correlations. We select K giants from LAMOST DR8 cross-matched with Gaia DR3, which has robust measurements of three-dimensional velocity and metallicity, and separate them into the disk, halo substructure and main halo components in the chemo-dynamical space utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model. The substructure component is highly radially anisotropic, and possibly related to the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) merger event, while the halo component is isotropic and accreted from the earliest mergers following the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution (Standard Halo Model, SHM). We find that the GES-like substructure contributes $\\sim85\\%$ of the local non-disk stars in the Solar neighbourhood, which is nearly invariant when applying different volume cuts or additional angular momentum constraints. Utilizing the metallicity-stellar-mass relation and the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation, we find that $\\sim25\\_{-15}^{+24}\\%$ of local DM is in the kinematic substructure. Combined with the stellar distributions of non-disk components, we compute the velocity distribution of local DM. The modified heliocentric velocity distribution of local DM shifts to a lower speed and has a sharper peak compared to the SHM, which yields updated detection limits for the DM direct detection experiments. Our work confirms that the local DM velocity distribution deviates from the SHM, and needs to be properly accounted in the DM detection experiments.\n\n", "2404.19338": "2024-04-30, **NMSSM Explanation for Excesses in the Search for Neutralinos and Charginos and a 95 GeV Higgs Boson**, Ulrich Ellwanger et.al., [2404.19338v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19338v1)\n\n The observed excesses in the search for neutralinos and charginos by ATLAS and CMS can be fitted simultaneously in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) assuming a light higgsino mass, of magnitude less than about 250 GeV, and a compressed higgsino dominated neutralino and chargino spectrum, with $5-10\\%$ mass splittings.

Sparticles prefer to decay first into the NLSP and remnants from the final decay into the LSP are too soft to contribute to the observed signals. Co-annihilation in the higgsino-sector can generate a relic density in the WMAP/Planck window. The singlino-like LSP has automatically a direct detection cross section below present and future sensitivities: a direct detection signal in the near future would exclude this scenario.

Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -UV spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non-detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN SED. Heavy X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton thick) column density and low dust content, such as the Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasar; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of Halpha in JWST-selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack the prominent, fast outflows characterizing low-z AGN and luminous quasars, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST-selected AGN match the definition of NLSy1, typically characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum, and this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to Very Massive Stars, Tidal Disruption Events, or Supernovae, although we show that a minority of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with the echo of superluminous SNe or TDE. Scenarios in which the broad lines are ascribed to galactic outflows are also untenable.

We discuss the application to astrophysical and laboratory laser experiment environments to clarify the roles of the ion Weibel instability. We develop a model for the isotropization length scale in Weibel-mediated shocks and compare its value to other characteristic length scales of each system. We find that electron heating to near equipartition is crucial for the formation of ultra-relativistic Weibel-mediated shocks.

Infrared emission in star-forming galaxies typically arises from recently formed, dust-enshrouded stars, whereas radio synchrotron emission is expected from subsequent supernovae. By leveraging the wealth of ancillary far-ultraviolet - far-infrared photometry from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) and Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) surveys, combined with 1.4 GHz observations from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey and Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) projects, we investigate the impact of timescale differences between far-ultraviolet - far-infrared and radio-derived star formation rate (SFR) tracers. We examine how the SED-derived star formation histories (SFH) of galaxies can be used to explain discrepancies in these SFR tracers, which are sensitive to different timescales. Galaxies exhibiting an increasing SFH have systematically higher L$\\_\\mathrm{TIR}$ and SED-derived SFRs than predicted from their 1.4 GHz radio luminosity. This indicates that insufficient time has passed for subsequent supernovae-driven radio emission to accumulate. We show that backtracking the SFR(t) of galaxies along their SED-derived SFHs to a time several hundred megayears prior to their observed epoch will both linearise the SFR-L$\\_\\mathrm{1.4GHz}$ relation and reduce the overall scatter. The minimum scatter in the SFR(t)-L$\\_\\mathrm{1.4GHz}$ is reached at 200 - 300 Myr prior, consistent with theoretical predictions for the timescales required to disperse the cosmic ray electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission.\n\n", "2405.00153": "2024-04-30, **Supernova limits on 'QCD axion-like particles'**, Alessandro Lella et.al., [2405.00153v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00153v1)\n\n In this paper, we explore the phenomenology of massive Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) coupled to quarks and gluons, dubbed 'QCD ALPs', with an emphasis on the associated low-energy observables.

The induced photon coupling allows ALPs with masses $m\\_a\\gtrsim1$ MeV to efficiently decay into photons, and astrophysical observables severely constrain the ALP parameter space.

This paper evaluates these methods in contexts where baryonic effects are negligible, focusing on dark matter-dominated models and assessing their effectiveness across both weak and strong lensing regimes.

Both $\\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\\texttt{turboGL}$ perform well in modeling the weak-lensing region influenced by mildly nonlinear structures. However, they lose accuracy in capturing small-scale nonlinear matter fields, owing to oversimplified assumptions about internal halo structures and reliance on perturbation theory.

The $r$-band (pseudo-bolometric) light curve has a shock-cooling phase lasting 20 (17) days followed by a 19 (23)-day plateau. The entire optically-thick phase lasts only $\\approx 55~$days following explosion, indicating that the red supergiant progenitor had a thinned H envelope prior to explosion.

This mixing process is driven by the Shock Driven Multiphase Instability (SDMI), a derivative of the canonical Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability (RMI). The SDMI deviates from the RMI as particle lag effects become significant, where a higher momentum deficit leads to longer equilibration times and a reduction in hydrodynamic mixing. In this work, the effect of particle lag (rate of momentum transfer) on the SDMI evolution was isolated and investigated utilizing solid nondeforming and nonevaporating particles of differing sizes while holding the effective density ratio (mass of particles in the interface) constant. Three particle sizes were selected with increasing velocity relaxation times. Experiments were conducted by accelerating a cylindrical interface comprised of air and seeded particles surrounded by clean (particle-free) air with a Mach 1.35 shock wave. The development of the multiphase interface was measured using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). Circulation measurements showed a decrease in mixing with increasing particle size.

In this study, we present the most extensive chemical abundance analysis of 12 low-metallicity stars with metallicities down to [Fe/H]$=-3.26$ and located in the main body of Sagittarius. These targets, selected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy survey, were observed using the MIKE high-resolution spectrograph at the Magellan-Clay telescope, which allows us to measure up to 17 chemical species. The chemical composition of these stars reflects the imprint of a variety of type~II supernovae. A combination of low- to intermediate-mass core-collapse and hypernovae ($\\sim10-70 M\\_{\\odot}$) is required to account for the abundance patterns of the lighter elements up to the Fe-peak.
