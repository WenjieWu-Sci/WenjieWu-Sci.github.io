We emphasize that the accurate determination and modeling of the terrestrial matter density profile are fundamental for extracting the oscillation parameters and probing the neutrino mass ordering. This paper presents a realistic piecewise-constant model for the shallow crustal density profile along the baselines from Taishan and Yangjiang to the experimental hall, based on geological and petrophysical information. The uncertainty in the density profiles arises from variations in the density and length of each segment, both of which are conservatively estimated to be 10\\%. A careful comparison of constant and fluctuated density profiles is provided and the implications for the precision measurement of oscillation parameters are discussed. Finally, we also discuss the possibility of tomography of the shallow Earth's crust in future reactor neutrino experiments.\n\n", "2511.15654": "2025-11-19, **Trimaximal Mixing Patterns Meet the First JUNO Result**, Di Zhang et.al., [2511.15654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15654v1)\n\n The JUNO experiment has recently released its first measurement results based on 59.1 days of data, achieving unprecedented precision in measuring the lepton mixing angle $\u03b8\\_{12}$. This significant improvement places stringent constraints on certain neutrino mass models and flavor mixing patterns. In this work, we examine the impact of the latest JUNO results on the two trimaximal (i.e., TM1 and TM2) mixing patterns. They are two well-motivated variants of the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern and predict specific correlations between $\u03b8\\_{12}$ and $\u03b8\\_{13}$, which lie outside the experimentally allowed $1\u03c3$ and $3\u03c3$ regions, respectively, after taking into account JUNO's results. Then, attempting to reconcile these TM mixing patterns with the latest experimental data, we further investigate the renormalization group (RG) running effects on them in the both Majorana and Dirac neutrino cases. Our analytical and numerical results show that RG corrections can bring the two TM mixing patterns into excellent agreement with the latest JUNO data if neutrino masses are quasi-degenerate. However, the Majorana case faces severe constraints from neutrinoless double beta decay limits, and particularly, the TM2 mixing pattern with Majorana neutrinos has been essentially ruled out. In the Dirac case, the TM1 mixing pattern is fully consistent with current data including beta decay results, whereas the TM2 pattern is strongly constrained by the KATRIN limit and even could be largely ruled out if the KATRIN experiment reaches its final sensitivity without any discovery. Future high-precision measurements of lepton mixing parameters and absolute neutrino masses in both oscillation and non-oscillation experiments will provide decisive tests of these mixing patterns.\n\n", "2511.15644": "2025-11-19, **The data processing system of the POEMMA-Balloon with Radio mission**, Valentina Scotti et.al., [2511.15644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15644v1)\n\n The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) mission incorporates an advanced data processing system (DP) to enable the detection and characterization of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and astrophysical neutrinos.

A key instrument of PBR is the Cherenkov Camera (CC), which utilizes a 2048-pixel SiPM camera to detect the optical Cherenkov emission from cosmic-ray-induced air showers and search for upward-going signals indicative of neutrinos.   The CC operates in the 320-900 nm spectral range with a 10 ns integration time, leveraging a bi-focal optical design to enhance detection efficiency. The CC enables precise reconstruction of shower trajectories and provides valuable data on cosmic rays' composition and energy distribution. PBR's sub-orbital altitude is particularly advantageous for these measurements, offering a unique vantage point that bridges the observational gap between ground-based and space-based instruments. Additionally, the CC will play a critical role in neutrino searches, detecting tau-lepton decay showers from Earth-skimming neutrinos associated with astrophysical transients. By integrating the CC with fluorescence and radio detection systems, PBR will pioneer a multi-messenger approach to high-energy cosmic phenomena, refining observational techniques for future space-based missions.

This non-detection may stem from limited sensitivity and source localization of current $\u03b3$-ray instruments, as well as strong interactions of $\u03b3$-rays with intervening material that restrict detectable signals to only a few nearby and dynamically active clusters.

In this work, we present a detailed study of Abell 119 (A119), a merging cluster with significant X-ray luminosity and complex dynamics.

In this paper, we investigate the matter effect of massive neutrinos in a scalar-type ultra-light dark matter and calculate the neutrino oscillation probability using the quantum field theory method. The result reveals that the neutrino oscillation probability derived from the quantum field theory approach exhibits no additional time dependence, which marks the most significant distinction from the oscillation result obtained through the quantum mechanics method.

In this work, we focus on the imprint of non-cold dark matter (DM), which impacts the formation of the smallest halos. Our goal in particular is to clarify whether near-future radio telescopes such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA), will be able to distinguish between free-streaming dark matter, specifically in the form of thermal warm DM (WDM), and collisional damping due to neutrino-DM ($\u03bd$DM) interactions giving rise to larger overdensities on small scales. For that purpose we first implement a mapping between the two models in terms of a cutoff scale and determine detection thresholds for the two DM models. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we show that $\u03bd$DM interaction strengths down to $\u03c3\\_{\u03bd{\\rm DM}}\\sim 3\\times10^{-35}$ cm$^2$ could be probed by $21\\,$cm cosmology when considering two populations of galaxies for a GeV mass DM.

For the effective mass $\\langle m\\_{ee} \\rangle$, the uncertainties in its lower limits for both mass orderings and upper limits for the normal ordering are largely reduced.

Its essential tenet is the modification of the gravity law at low accelerations. Nevertheless, despite MOND's passed tests, the puzzle of the missing mass on galaxy clusters' scales still persists. One proposed scenario to complete this deficit and apply it further to cosmology is the so-called $\u03bd$HDM model. It is composed of a sterile neutrino and the MOND gravity. In this Ph.D. thesis, I have put forward this cosmological idea, conducting hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the $\u03bd$HDM structure formation. In the debut attempt, the $\u03bd$HDM model was proven capable of reproducing the $\u039b$CDM cosmology, imitating the same expansion history ($\u03a9\\_m \\approx$ 0.3 and $H\\_0 \\approx$ 67.6 km/s/Mpc), reproducing the CMB phenomenology, while the cosmic web is nicely formed.

We also aim to derive the solar photospheric abundance of C, using the diagnostic transitions in the optical (4218 - 4356 \u00c5) and infrared (33025 - 37944 \u00c5).   Methods. We use the updated NLTE model molecule from Popa et al. (2023) and different solar 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model atmospheres. The models are contrasted against new spatially-resolved optical solar spectra, and the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of CH lines is studied.   Results. The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE models fail to describe the line CLV, and lead to underestimated solar C abundances.

Two versions of the model are examined: one with vector self-interactions up to second order ($\u03c9\\_0^2$) and another including a fourth-order term ($\u03c9\\_0^4$). We show that SRC tend to soften the equation of state when only the quadratic term is present, but produce a noticeable stiffening once the $\u03c9\\_0^4$ term is included. The corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solutions for pure neutron stars indicate that short-range correlations reduce the maximum mass in the first case but increase it in the second. Extending the analysis to stars containing a fermionic dark matter component, within the two-fluid formalism, we verify that the same features appear in the respective mass-radius diagrams.

I argue that the application of Psillos' general scientific realist framework in the local context of dark matter is misguided, partly because of the overlooked metaphysical commitments underpinning causal-descriptivism, and partly because the extension of 'dark matter' on this account includes entities we do not currently consider to be dark matter, and exclude entities that we currently consider could be dark matter.

The displacement vector field, arising naturally in Lyra's manifold, provides an additional geometric contribution.

Our results show that the multiplets exhibit stronger clustering bias as they trace more massive dark matter halos than individual galaxies. When comparing the observed clustering statistics with the mock catalogs generated from the N-body simulation AbacusSummit, we find that the mocks underpredict multiplet clustering despite reproducing the galaxy two-point auto-correlation reasonably well. This discrepancy indicates that the standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model is insufficient to describe the properties of galaxy multiplets, revealing the greater constraining power of this higher-order statistic on galaxy-halo connection and the possibility that multiplets are specific to additional assembly bias. We demonstrate that incorporating secondary biases into the HOD model improves agreement with the observed multiplet statistics, specifically by allowing galaxies to preferentially occupy halos in denser environments.

Using appropriately defined effective energy tensors, we show that the method can be extended to include also the effects of higher order perturbations. The generality of this effective description of the effects of dark energy on cosmological perturbations gives a solid theoretical justification for the phenomenological approaches often used in the analysis of cosmological observations, allowing to understand the mapping between the results of phenomenological analysis of observational data and theoretical models.

Numerical simulations have shown that dynamical friction ceases to operate in cores of (roughly) constant density, a phenomenon known as core stalling. In addition, such cores often are unstable to a dipole instability that gives rise to dynamical buoyancy, causing massive central objects to move outward. Thus far, these manifestations of core dynamics have only been demonstrated in collisionless systems. In this paper, we use idealized N-body simulations to study whether core stalling and dynamical buoyancy operate in SIDM halos. We find that if the self-interactions are sufficiently strong, neither core stalling nor buoyancy are present, and a massive perturber will quickly sink all the way to the center of its host. In doing so, it gravitationally contracts the core, catalyzing a strongly accelerated core collapse. The reason why core dynamics are so different in SIDM halos is that self-interactions drive the halo's distribution function to a featureless exponential, removing any inflections or plateaus that are responsible for the dipole instability and core stalling in the case of CDM.

Strong and weak lensing constraints on the density profiles of subhalos and their truncation radii offer key diagnostics for distinguishing between collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Notably, in the strongly collisional SIDM regime, subhalo core collapse and enhanced mass loss from ram-pressure stripping predict steeper central density slopes and more compact truncation radii--features that are directly testable with current lensing data. We analyze subhalo truncation in eight lensing clusters (Abell 2218, 383, 963, 209, 2390, and MACS J0416.1, J1206.2, J1149.6) that span the redshift range <$z\\_\\text{spec}$>$ \\simeq 0.17$-$0.54$ with virial masses $M\\_{200} \\simeq0.41$-$2.2\\times 10^{15}$ M$\\_\\odot$ to constrain SIDM versus CDM.

Equilateral-type PNG, generically predicted by single-field inflationary models with higher-derivative interactions, imprints subtle but measurable signatures on the large-scale distribution of matter. An important parameter of these imprints is the PNG-induced bias coefficient $b\\_\u03c8$, which quantifies how the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos and galaxies respond to mode coupling in the initial conditions. Measuring $b\\_\u03c8$ is important for constraining equilateral PNG, yet it is notoriously challenging due to its degeneracy with Gaussian scale-dependent bias contributions. In this work, we present the first precision measurements of equilateral $b\\_\u03c8$ for dark matter halos using effective field theory at the field level. We show that this approach disentangles PNG effects from those of the Gaussian bias by virtue of noise variance cancellation. We compare our results with the phenomenological predictions based on the Peak-Background Split model, finding some agreement at the qualitative level on the redshift and mass dependence, but poor agreement at the quantitative level.

If the coupling of the mediators to the Standard Model is feeble, but the coupling to the dark matter is large enough, the dark sector may reach equilibrium at a temperature distinct from that of the thermal bath. The relic density is then said to be obtained via decoupled freeze out (DFO). We focus on the $s$-wave annihilation scenario, which particularly benefits from the DFO mechanism by evading standard CMB limits while still yielding indirect detection signals. We calculate the relic density by solving a set of four coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities of the dark sector particles and the energy transfer from the light to dark sector.

These variations modify the predicted abundance of light elements during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the process of recombination, thereby affecting the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We use CMB anisotropy data and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements to obtain constraints on the variation of couplings over a wide range of ULDM masses.

We find that the allowed ULDM fraction of total dark matter abundance is more constrained for ULDM masses $\\lesssim 10^{-26}~\\mathrm{eV}$ in the presence of the variations.

We study a class of dark-sector dynamics in which a scalar dark energy field, governed by a Z2-symmetric quartic potential, interacts with dark matter through Yukawa and portal couplings. When the matter density drops below a critical threshold, a cosmological spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism generates a time-dependent vacuum expectation value v(a) and activates an effective coupling eta(a). This creates a symmetric phase (a <= ac) identical to LambdaCDM at early times, and a broken phase (a > ac) in which eta(a) > 0 transfers energy from dark matter to dark energy, suppressing linear structure growth. Using RSD, BAO, cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, and compressed Planck distance priors, we compare a fixed LambdaCDM background with a self-consistent coupled-scalar evolution. The RSD-only analysis shows a strong shift: the dynamical background gives Omega\\_m ~ 0.31 +/- 0.10 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.59 +/- 0.01, while the fixed-background case gives Omega\\_m ~ 0.20 +/- 0.09 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.75 +/- 0.05.

At the upper end of their distribution is SN\\,2023taz, one of the most luminous SLSNe discovered to date with a peak absolute magnitude of $M\\_{g,\\rm{peak}}=-22.75 \\pm 0.03$ and a lower limit for energy radiated of $E=2.9 \\times 10^{51}$\\,erg. Magnetar model fits reveal individual parameter values typical of the SLSN population, but the combination of a low $B$-field and ejecta mass with a short spin period places SN\\,2023taz in a unusual region of parameter space, accounting for its extreme luminosity. The optical data around peak are consistent with a temperature of $\\sim$17\\,000\\,K but SN\\,2023taz shows a surprising deficit in the UV compared to other events in this temperature range. We find no indication of dust extinction that could plausibly explain the UV deficit. The lower level of UV flux is reminiscent of the absorption seen in lower-luminosity events like SN\\,2017dwh, where Fe-group elements are responsible for the effect. However, in the case of SN\\,2023taz, there is no evidence for a larger amount of Fe-group elements which could contribute to line blanketing. Comparing to SLSNe with well-observed UV spectra, an underlying temperature of $8000-9000$\\,K would match the UV spectral slope, but is not consistent with the optical colour temperatures of these events. The most likely explanation is enhanced absorption by intermediate-mass elements, challenging previous findings that SLSNe exhibit similar UV absorption line equivalent widths. This highlights the need for expanded UV spectroscopic coverage of SLSNe, especially at early times, to build a framework for interpreting their diversity and to enable classification at higher redshifts where optical observations will exclusively probe rest-frame UV emission.\n\n", "2511.14829": "2025-11-18, **Delayed Wind Onset in Pa 30, the Remnant of Type Iax SN 1181**, Takatoshi Ko et.al., [2511.14829v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14829v1)\n\n Pa 30 is the recently identified remnant of the historical supernova SN 1181, likely a Type Iax event, and a nebula surrounding the central white dwarf launching a fast wind ($\\sim10^9~\\cm~\\s^{-1}$) is observed in optical and infrared bands. X-ray observations show that this wind collides with the surrounding material and produces a termination shock, and the observed extent of the shock indicates that the wind started blowing centuries after 1181 A.D. rather than immediately after the SN explosion. We propose that the wind is triggered by delayed ignition of fallback carbon-rich material on the WD surface and investigate the conditions that reproduce such delayed ignition. We show that producing delays of several centuries requires a relatively hot post-explosion WD core with a temperature $T\\_c \\simeq 6\\times10^8~\\mathrm{K}$. This supports the pure-deflagration progenitor scenario for Type Iax SN 1181, which implies the presence of a He star companion inside Pa~30; we also discuss why such a potential He star has not been detected and its prospects for discovery by future observations.\n\n", "2511.14686": "2025-11-18, **Massive runaway star HD 254577: the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of the supernova remnant IC 443**, B. Din\u00e7el et.al., [2511.14686v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14686v1)\n\n The secondaries of the massive binary systems can be found as runaway stars after being ejected due to the supernova (SN) of the more massive component. We search for such stars inside the supernova remnants (SNRs), where a recent SN is guaranteed to have happened. In this paper, we present the massive runaway star HD~254577 as the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of the supernova remnant IC~443 and the neutron star (NS) CXOU~J61705.3$+$222127. We performed spectroscopic observations of the runaway star and specified its atmospheric parameters. Together with the precise \\textit{Gaia} DR3 astrometry and photometry, we identified the possible birth origin of the runaway star, and by isochrone fitting, we determined the progenitor mass. From the \\textit{Gaia} DR3 proper motions, we specified the possible explosion sites and calculated the neutron star (NS) velocity. HD~254577 is a hot and evolved star with an effective temperature of $24000\\pm1000$ K (B0.5II) and a surface gravity of $\\log({g~\\rm[cm/s^2]})=2.75\\pm0.25$. It is probably a single star with a peculiar 3-D velocity of $31.3^{+1.2}\\_{-0.9}$ km~s$^{-1}$, lying at a heliocentric distance of $1701^{+55}\\_{-54}$ pc. The cometary tail of the NS implies that it is moving away from the same site as the runaway star. From the flight trajectories, we calculated that the NS has typical pulsar velocities such as $254-539$ km~s$^{-1}$ at a distance of $1.7$ kpc for $10-20$ kyr ages. Together with the blue-only shifted interstellar medium lines on its spectrum, HD~254577 must be the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of IC~443. By identifying the pre-supernova companion and the possible parent cluster, we showed that the progenitor zero-age main sequence mass is high: $31-64$ M$\\_\\odot$.

We explore models with AGB masses in the range $1.5$--$3.5\\,{\\rm M\\_{\\odot}}$, WD masses in the range $0.7$--$1.25\\,{\\rm M\\_{\\odot}}$, and separations in the range $1$--$8\\,{\\rm kR\\_{\\odot}}$. We find that all models exhibit a significant long-term orbital increase. This trend is primarily driven by the fact that approximately $99\\%$ of the AGB mass is lost from the system, either directly via a wind that is not accreted by the WD, or accreted onto the WD and subsequently ejected during nova eruptions. As a result, the secular orbital response to mass loss or mass transfer dominates over angular-momentum-loss sinks that could otherwise shrink the orbit, producing a consistent orbital widening. Consequently, all WD masses gradually decrease with time. More massive WDs achieve higher mass-transfer efficiencies and accretion rates, leading to slightly higher mass-retention efficiencies per nova. However, because higher accretion rates also produce more frequent eruptions, the total WD mass lost over the AGB lifetime is larger in these systems. We conclude that symbiotic systems transferring mass via the BHL mechanism are unlikely to be viable progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.\n\n", "2511.14578": "2025-11-18, **Point-symmetric morphology in supernova remnant G11.2-0.3: the jittering jets explosion mechanism**, Noam Soker et.al., [2511.14578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14578v1)\n\n I identify a point-symmetric morphology in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant SNR G11.2-0.3 composed of three pairs of opposite morphological features, and attribute their shaping to three energetic pairs of jets during the explosion process in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The pairs of morphological features are two opposite rings, a strip of dense ejecta extending on both sides of the central pulsar PSR J1811-1925, and an ear-nozzle opposite structure. According to the JJEM, additional weaker pairs of jets may also have participated in the explosion. The jets' axis from the ear to the nozzle coincides with the axis of the presently active pulsar jets, which is the pulsar spin axis. The jets of this pair were the last that the newly born neutron star launched during the explosion, and the accretion disk that launched these jets spun up the neutron star in the same direction as the jets. The identification of a point-symmetric morphology in SNR G11.2-0.3 strengthens the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.\n\n", "2511.14332": "2025-11-18, **On the impact of the supernova subsamples in reducing the Hubble tension**, Gon\u00e7alo Martins et.al., [2511.14332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14332v1)\n\n The persistent 4-6$\u03c3$ difference between early- and late-time Hubble constant ($H\\_{0}$) measurements, known as the \"Hubble tension,\" is a major problem in modern cosmology. We study how differences in colour ($c$), stretch ($x\\_{1}$), and host galaxy properties-stellar mass ($M$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR)-between calibration and Hubble Flow (HF) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) samples used by SH0ES affect SN luminosity standardization and $H\\_{0}$ estimates.

We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov to assess the consistency between subsamples and reveal how parameter estimates change as sample matching improves. The calibration sample is not fully representative of the HF sample, especially in $M$ and sSFR. Improving sample consistency leads to changes in $H\\_{0}$, $M\\_{B}$, $\u03b1$, and $\u03c3\\_{int}$, though overall values remain broadly stable. Better-matched subsamples tend to yield a mass step consistent with zero within 1$\u03c3$.

These differences suggest SNe Ia subpopulations with varying dust and intrinsic colour not captured by a single $\u03b2$, impacting cosmology. Estimating a single $H\\_{0}$ for both subpopulations yields $H\\_{0} = 73.78 \\pm 2.17$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, with a much larger uncertainty that lowers the Hubble tension from $5.87\u03c3$ to $\\sim2.86\u03c3$.

We study a class of dark-sector dynamics in which a scalar dark energy field, governed by a Z2-symmetric quartic potential, interacts with dark matter through Yukawa and portal couplings. When the matter density drops below a critical threshold, a cosmological spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism generates a time-dependent vacuum expectation value v(a) and activates an effective coupling eta(a). This creates a symmetric phase (a <= ac) identical to LambdaCDM at early times, and a broken phase (a > ac) in which eta(a) > 0 transfers energy from dark matter to dark energy, suppressing linear structure growth. Using RSD, BAO, cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, and compressed Planck distance priors, we compare a fixed LambdaCDM background with a self-consistent coupled-scalar evolution. The RSD-only analysis shows a strong shift: the dynamical background gives Omega\\_m ~ 0.31 +/- 0.10 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.59 +/- 0.01, while the fixed-background case gives Omega\\_m ~ 0.20 +/- 0.09 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.75 +/- 0.05.

A late-time interaction triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking can therefore damp structure growth and ease the S8 tension while leaving the expansion history and the inferred H0 essentially unchanged, suggesting distinct physical origins for the two tensions.\n\n", "2511.14126": "2025-11-18, **The Origin of the Mg-rich Supernova Remnant J0550-6823 and the Frequency of Similar Events in the Large Magellanic Cloud**, Yui Kuboike et.al., [2511.14126v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14126v1)\n\n Shell burning and internal mixing in massive stars play an important role in setting the initial conditions for core-collapse supernova explosions. In the late stages of stellar evolution, intense shell burning can cause distinct convective regions to merge, fundamentally restructuring the stellar interior. Although such phenomena are difficult to observe directly, the observation of ``Mg-rich'' supernova remnants (SNRs) has recently emerged as a potential signature of these events. In this study, we reanalyze X-ray observations of J0550--6823, a SNR in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and a new candidate Mg-rich SNR. Our spectral analysis confirms a low Ne/Mg mass ratio of $\\approx$1, and its classification as Mg-rich. By comparing the observational results with pre-supernova models, we suggest that the progenitor of J0550-6823 likely had an extended convective shell that reduces the Ne/Mg ratio prior to its explosion. Furthermore, we observe that $\\sim$2--3 Mg-rich SNRs exist in the LMC, suggesting that $\\lesssim$10--40\\% of massive stars in the LMC may have had an extended convective shell, similar to what we observed in J0550-6823.

Prust et.al., [2511.14039v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14039v1)\n\n White dwarfs which explode by the double-detonation mechanism may have a binary white dwarf donor which is subsequently ignited by its collision with the ejecta. This results in the destruction of the donor via either the triple- or quadruple-detonation mechanism, adding significant mass to the resulting ejecta as well as modifying its structure and composition. We simulate the evolution of supernova remnants resulting from such detonations in a variety of binary progenitors and compare them against a double detonation with a surviving donor. Because of the time delay between the detonations of the two white dwarfs, high-velocity ejecta from the first explosion governs the first few centuries of remnant evolution, whereas at later times the dense core resulting from the donor detonation drives both the forward and reverse shocks to larger radii. The collision between the highest-velocity ejecta of the primary explosion and the donor carves a conical wake into the ejecta, which persists into the remnant phase regardless of whether or not the donor detonates. Our suite of simulated remnants are found to exhibit multiple distinguishing features of the explosion properties: a distinct X-ray morphology in the thermal emission and iron lines for triple detonations and smaller remnants with centrally-concentrated emission for double detonations. The remnants are also varied in their elemental abundances and distributions, particularly for lighter elements, but these have limited observational utility and are sensitive to the properties of the progenitor binary.\n\n"}}
