II. Population-level correlations between galactic infrared, radio, and \u03b3-ray emission**, Matt A. Roth et.al., [2310.05693v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05693v1)\n\n Galaxies obey a number of empirical correlations between their radio, {\\gamma}-ray, and infrared emission, but the physical origins of these correlations remain uncertain. Here we use the CONGRuENTS model for broadband non-thermal emission from star-forming galaxies, which self-consistently calculates energy-dependent transport and non-thermal emission from cosmic ray hadrons and leptons, to predict radio and {\\gamma}-ray emission for a synthetic galaxy population with properties drawn from a large deep-field survey. We show that our synthetic galaxies reproduce observed relations such as the FIR-radio correlation, the FIR-{\\gamma} correlation, and the distribution of radio spectral indices, and we use the model to explain the physical origins of these relations. Our results show that the FIR-radio correlation arises because the amount of cosmic ray electron power ultimately radiated as synchrotron emission varies only weakly with galaxy star formation rate as a result of the constraints imposed on gas properties by hydrostatic balance and turbulent dynamo action; the same physics dictates the extent of proton calorimetry in different galaxies, and thus sets the FIR-{\\gamma}-ray correlation. We further show that galactic radio spectral indices result primarily from competition between thermal free-free emission and energy-dependent loss of cosmic ray electrons to bremsstrahlung and escape into galactic halos, with shaping of the spectrum by inverse Compton, synchrotron, and ionisation processes typically playing a sub-dominant role. In addition to explaining existing observations, we use our analysis to predict a heretofore unseen correlation between the curvature of galaxies' radio spectra and their pion-driven {\\gamma}-ray emission, a prediction that will be testable with upcoming facilities.\n\n", "2310.05676": "2023-10-09, **Light Thermal Self-Interacting Dark Matter in the Shadow of Non-Standard Cosmology**, Shu-Yu Ho et.al., [2310.05676v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05676v1)\n\n In this paper, we construct a viable model for a GeV scale self-interacting dark matter (DM), where the DM was thermally produced in the early universe. In this model, a new vector-like fermion with a dark charge under the $U(1)\\_{D}$ gauge symmetry serves as a secluded WIMP DM and it can dominantly annihilate into the light dark gauge boson and singlet scalar through the dark gauge interaction. Also, the self-interaction of DM is induced by the light dark gauge boson via the same gauge interaction. In addition to these particles, we further introduce two Weyl fermions and a doublet scalar, by which the dark gauge boson produced from $s$-wave DM annihilations can mostly decay into active neutrinos after the dark symmetry breaking such that the CMB bound on the DM with low masses can be eluded. In order to have a common parameter region to explain the observed relic abundance and self-interaction of DM, we also study this model in a non-standard cosmological evolution, where the cosmic expansion driven by a new field species is faster than the standard radiation-dominated universe during the frozen time of DM. Reversely, one can also use the self-interacting nature of light thermal DM to examine the non-standard cosmological history of the universe.\n\n", "2310.05669": "2023-10-09, **Transverse Emittance Reduction in Muon Beams by Ionization Cooling**, MICE Collaboration et.al., [2310.05669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05669v1)\n\n Accelerated muon beams have been considered for next-generation studies of high-energy lepton-antilepton collisions and neutrino oscillations. However, high-brightness muon beams have not yet been produced. The main challenge for muon acceleration and storage stems from the large phase-space volume occupied by the beam, derived from the muon production mechanism through the decay of pions from proton collisions. Ionization cooling is the technique proposed to decrease the muon beam phase-space volume. Here we demonstrate a clear signal of ionization cooling through the observation of transverse emittance reduction in beams that traverse lithium hydride or liquid hydrogen absorbers in the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE). The measurement is well reproduced by the simulation of the experiment and the theoretical model.

This superb statistics provides a unique window to set bounds on neutrino properties, as its mass and lifetime. We shall explore the capabilities of such a future detector, constraining the former two properties via the time delay and the flux suppression induced in the Supernovae neutrino time and energy spectra. Special attention will be devoted to the statistically sub-dominant elastic scattering induced events, normally neglected, which can substantially improve the neutrino mass bound via time delays. When allowing for a invisible decaying scenario, the $95\\%~$C.L. lower bound on $\\tau/m$ is almost one order of magnitude better than the one found with SN1987A neutrino events. Simultaneous limits can be set on both $m\\_\\nu$ and $\\tau\\_{\\nu}$, combining the neutrino flux suppression with the time-delay signature: the best constrained lifetime is that of $\\nu\\_1$, which has the richest electronic component.

For HE neutrinos produced close to the stellar center ($\\lesssim 10^{9}-10^{11}$ cm), we find that the emerging all-flavor spectrum for neutrinos of $E\\gtrsim 0.1$ PeV could be modified by a factor $E^{-n}$ with $n\\approx 0.4-0.5$. Flavor evolution of LE neutrinos does not affect this result but can change the emerging flavor composition of HE neutrinos. As a consequence, the above annihilation effect needs to be considered for HE neutrinos produced at nonrelativistic or mildly relativistic shocks at small radii. In particular, we point out that models of core-collapse supernovae with slow jets and charmed meson decay can better fit the diffuse HE neutrino flux observed by IceCube if annihilation of HE and LE neutrinos is taken into account. Moreover, the relevance of charmed meson and the annihilation effect can be tested by precise measurements of the diffuse neutrino spectrum and flavor composition.\n\n", "2310.05050": "2023-10-08, **Universality of the Neutrino Collisional Flavor Instability in Core Collapse Supernovae**, Jiabao Liu et.al., [2310.05050v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05050v1)\n\n Neutrinos are known to undergo flavor conversion processes among the three flavors. The fast flavor conversion (FFC) has been the central piece of flavor conversions taking place in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) due to its shorter timescale to the completion of flavor conversion compared to other types of flavor conversion. Although the ordinary collisions between neutrinos and matter were once thought to decohere neutrinos and thus damp flavor conversions, it was recently realized that they can also induce the flavor conversion. The linear analysis showed that the so-called collisional flavor instability or CFI occurs in the absence of FFC. In this paper, we investigate if CFI takes place in of the post-bounce core of CCSNe, using the results of spherically symmetric Boltzmann simulations of CCSNe for four progenitor models with different masses. We also provide a necessary (but not sufficient) condition of matter properties for the occurrence of CFI in optically thick and semi-transparent regions; baryon mass density ($\\rho$), electron fraction ($Y\\_e$), and the degeneracy of electron-type neutrinos ($\\eta\\_{\\nu\\_e}$) need to be $10^{10} {\\rm g/cm^3} \\lesssim \\rho \\lesssim 10^{12} {\\rm g/cm^3}$, $Y\\_e\\lesssim 0.4$, and $\\eta\\_{\\nu\\_e} \\lesssim 0.5$, respectively.

We determine the parameter limits associated with the stability criteria of critical points of the dynamical system for both the models. Additionally, the introduction of interaction reveals variations in the dynamical aspects of cosmic evolution, contingent on the range of values for the relevant model parameters. These results are consistent with the observed features of cosmic evolution within specific limits of the $f(R)$ models parameters and the coupling parameter $\\alpha$.

Recent developments in the fabrication of superconducting qubits are contributing to driving progress in Quantum Sensing. Such devices have already been successfully applied in detecting few-GHz single photons via Quantum Non-Demolition measurement (QND).
