Grigorishin et.al., [2401.16346v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16346v1)\n\n By analogy with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of multi-band superconductors with inner (interband) Josephson couplings we formulate the three-band Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model with weak Josephson couplings between strongly asymmetrical condensates of scalar (Higgs) fields. Unlike usual single-band model, we found three Higgs bosons corresponding to three generations of particles, moreover the heaviest of them corresponds to the already discovered H-boson from the single-band theory and decay into fermions of only the third generation. The other two decay into fermions of the first and second generations accordingly, but they are difficult to observe due to very poor conditions for production. We found two sterile ultra-light Leggett bosons, the Bose condensates of which form the dark halos of galaxies and their clusters (i.e so called \"dark matter\"). The masses of the Leggett bosons are determined by the coefficient of the interband coupling and can be arbitrarily small ($\\sim 10^{-20}\\mathrm{eV}$) due to non-perturbativeness of the interband coupling. Since propagation of Leggett bosons is not accompanied by current, these bosons are not absorbed by gauge fields unlike the common-mode Goldstone bosons. Three coupled condensates of the scalar fields causes the existence of three generations of leptons, where each generation interacts with the corresponding condensate getting mass. The interflavour mixing between the generations of active neutrinos and sterile right-handed neutrinos in the three-band system causes the existence of mass states of neutrino without interaction with the Higgs condensates.\n\n", "2401.16257": "2024-01-29, **Neutrino Masses and Higher Degree Siegel Modular Forms**, Maibam Ricky Devi et.al., [2401.16257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16257v1)\n\n In this work, we have analyzed a neutrino model within the distinct framework of modular forms with degree, $ g>1 $ . This offers a more generalized scenario of modular forms which is popularly known as Siegel modular forms. We explore the implications of this special case of automorphic forms for physics beyond the standard model (BSM) within the lepton sector. In our model, we explicitly treat the Yukawa couplings as Siegel modular forms with both degree and level being equivalent to 2.

The constraint to the model is formulated by the condition $L\\_{\\rm NB}\\leq 3\\times 10^{52}$ erg/s according to G. Raffelt with $L\\_{\\rm NB}$ the luminosity of BSM neutral boson. Computing the above luminosity in the large coupling case, the so-called trapping regime, is non-trivial since the luminosity is a competition between the large production rate and the efficient absorption or decay rate of the neutral boson. We illustrate such a subtlety using $U(1)\\_{L\\_\\mu-L\\_\\tau}$ model as an example where the $Z^{\\prime}$ luminosity, $L\\_{Z^{\\prime}}$, from the neutrinosphere is calculated.

To produce PBHs with sufficient abundance, the primordial scalar power spectrum needs to be enhanced to the order of 0.01. Considering the third-order polynomial potential with polynomial $\\alpha$ attractors, we show that PBHs with the mass about $10^{17}$g can be produced while satisfying the constraints from the cosmic microwave background observations at the 2$\\sigma$ confidence level. The mass of PBHs produced in the polynomial $\\alpha$ attractors can be much bigger than that in the exponential $\\alpha$ attractors. By adding a negative power-law term to the polynomials, abundant PBHs with different masses and the accompany scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) with different peak frequency are easily generated. The PBHs with masses around $10^{-15}-10^{-12}$ $M\\_\\odot$ can account for almost all dark matter. The SIGWs generated in the nanohertz band can explain the recent detection of stochastic gravitational wave background by the pulsar timing array observations. The non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbations in the squeezed and equilateral limits are calculated numerically. We find that the non-Gaussianity correction greatly enhances the PBH abundance which makes the production of PBHs much easier, but the effect of non-Gaussianity on the generation of SIGWs is negligible.\n\n", "2401.16002": "2024-01-29, **The phase-space distribution of the M81 satellite system**, Oliver M\u00fcller et.al., [2401.16002v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16002v1)\n\n The spatial distribution of dwarf galaxies around their host galaxies is a critical test for the standard model of cosmology because it probes the dynamics of dark matter halos and is independent of the internal baryonic processes of galaxies. Co-moving planes-of-satellites have been found around the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy, and the nearby CenA galaxy, which seem to be at odds with the standard model of galaxy formation. Another nearby galaxy group, with a putative flattened distribution of dwarfs, is the M81 group. We present a quantitative analysis of the distribution of the M81 satellites using a Hough transform to detect linear structures. We confirm a flattened distribution of dwarf galaxies. Depending on the morphological type, we find a minor-to-major axis ratio of the satellite distribution to be 0.5 (all types) or 0.3 (dSph), which is in line with previous results for the M81 group. Comparing the orientation of this flattened structure in 3D with the surrounding large-scale matter distribution, we find a strong alignment with the local sheet and the planes-of-satellites around the Andromeda galaxy and Cen A. Employing velocities for a sub-sample of the dwarfs, we find no signal of co-rotation. Comparing the flattening and motion of the M81 dwarf galaxy system with IllustrisTNG50 we find good agreement between observations and simulations, but caution that i) velocity information of half of the satellites is missing, ii) velocities are coming mainly from dwarf irregulars clustered around NGC3077, which may hint towards an infall of a dwarf galaxy group and iii) some of the dwarfs may actually be tidal dwarf galaxies. From the missing velocities, we predict that the observed frequency within TNG may range between 2 to 29 per cent. Any conclusions about the agreement/disagreement with cosmological models needs to wait for a more complete picture of the dwarf galaxy system.\n\n", "2401.15971": "2024-01-29, **The sizes of bright Lyman-break galaxies at $z\\simeq3-5$ with JWST PRIMER**, R.

The sample was selected from seeing-dominated ground-based data, presenting an unbiased sampling of the morphology and size distributions of luminous sources. We fit S\\'ersic profiles to eight NIRCam bands and also measure a non-parametric half-light radius. We find that the size distributions with both measurements are well-fit by a log-normal distribution at all redshifts, consistent with disk formation models where size is governed by host dark-matter halo angular momentum. We find a size-redshift evolution of $R\\_{e} = 3.51(1+z)^{-0.60\\pm0.22}$ kpc, in agreement with JWST studies. When considering the typical (modal) size over $z=3-5$, we find little evolution with bright LBGs remaining compact at $R\\_{e}\\simeq0.7-0.9$ kpc. Simultaneously, we find evidence for a build-up of large ($R\\_{e} > 2$ kpc) galaxies by $z=3$. We find some evidence for a negatively sloped size-mass relation at $z=5$ when S\\'ersic profiles are used to fit the data in F200W. The intrinsic scatter in our size-mass relations increases at higher redshifts. Additionally, measurements probing the rest-UV (F200W) show larger intrinsic scatter than those probing the rest-optical (F356W). Finally, we leverage rest-UV and rest-optical photometry to show that disky galaxies are well established by $z=5$, but are beginning to undergo dissipative processes, such as mergers, by $z=3$. The agreement of our size-mass and size-luminosity relations with simulations provides tentative evidence for centrally concentrated star formation at high-redshift.\n\n", "2401.15868": "2024-01-29, **Wormholes inside stars and black holes**, Shin'ichi Nojiri et.al., [2401.15868v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15868v1)\n\n We construct models of two exotic objects: (i) a wormhole whose throat is hidden by a stellar object like a neutron star; and (ii) a wormhole inside a black hole. We work within Einstein's gravity coupled to two scalar fields with a specific choice of the scalar field Lagrangian. In general, the model contains ghosts, but they are eliminated using the constraints given by the Lagrange multiplier fields. The constraints are a generalization of the mimetic constraint, where non-dynamical dark matter effectively appears. As a result, in our model, instead of the non-dynamical dark matter, non-dynamical exotic matter like a phantom effectively arises. For the mixed wormhole-plus-star system, we find the corresponding mass-radius relations and show that it is possible to get characteristics comparable to those of ordinary neutron stars. For the wormhole inside the black hole, we find an extremal limit where the radius of the throat coincides with the radius of the event horizon and demonstrate that the Hawking temperature vanishes in this limit.\n\n", "2401.15808": "2024-01-29, **Galactic Structure From Binary Pulsar Accelerations: Beyond Smooth Models**, Thomas Donlon II et.al., [2401.15808v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15808v1)\n\n We measure the line-of-sight accelerations of 26 binary pulsars due to the Milky Way's gravitational potential, and produce a 3-dimensional map of the acceleration field of the Galaxy.

Here, we provide for the first time, values for the Oort constants and the slope of the rotation curve from direct acceleration measurements. We find that $A=15.4\\pm2.6$ km/s/kpc and $B=-13.1\\pm2.6$ km/s/kpc (consistent with results from \\textit{Gaia}), and the slope of the rotation curve near the Sun is $-2\\pm5$ km/s/kpc. We show that the Galactic acceleration field is clearly asymmetric, but due to data limitations it is not yet clear which physical processes drive this asymmetry. We provide updated models of the Galactic potential that account for various sources of disequilibrium; these models are incompatible with commonly used kinematic potentials. This indicates that use of kinematically derived Galactic potentials in precision tests (e.g., in tests of general relativity with pulsar timing) may be subject to larger uncertainties than reported. The acceleration data indicates that the mass of the Galaxy within the Solar circle is $2.3 \\times 10^{11}$ M$\\_\\odot$, roughly twice as large as currently accepted models.

Considering their large potential number and the sufficient momentum-energy transfer to the interstellar medium (ISM), they are a key part of our understanding of the overall role of SNRs in the ISM. Here we report our discovery of an expanding molecular shell identified by CO line observations, namely G16.11-0.51. It covers a known SNR, specifically G16.0-0.5, and is larger in size, i.e. 0.56 deg over 0.20 deg. Based on its spatial and kinematic structures, weak nonthermal radio-continuum emission, and derived physical properties, we suggest that it is an old SNR. At a systemic velocity of +41.3 km s^-1, the best estimated kinematic distance of G16.11-0.51 is ~3.2 kpc, implying its radius of about 15.6 pc. The age of G16.11-0.51 is estimated to be greater than ~10^5 yr, and, in a dense molecular environment, it has formed dense and thin shell layers. The kinetic energy of the expanding molecular gas of G16.11-0.51 is about 6.4x10^49 erg, accounting for approximately six percent of the initial SN explosion energy.
