In the present calculation, we utilize a variant of the approach that restores rotational symmetry and mixes states projected from self-consistent mean-field configurations obtained by solving the HF equations with the density-independent local Skyrme interaction. Our calculations yield $\\|\\mathcal{M}\\_{2\\nu\\beta\\beta}\\| = 0.056(6)$ MeV$^{-1}$ for the nuclear matrix element describing this process.

The inclusion of $^{163}$Ho atoms introduces an excess heat capacity due to a pronounced Schottky anomaly, which can affect the detector's energy resolution, signal height, and response time. We fabricated TES arrays with varying levels of $^{163}$Ho activity and characterized their performance in terms of energy resolution, decay time constants, and heat capacity. The intrinsic energy resolution was found to degrade with increasing $^{163}$Ho activity, consistent with the expected scaling of heat capacity. From the analysis, we determined the specific heat capacity of $^{163}$Ho to be $(2.9 \\pm 0.4 \\mathrm{(stat)} \\pm 0.7 \\mathrm{(sys)})$ J/K/mol at $(94 \\pm 1)$\\,mK, close to the literature values for metallic holmium. No additional long decay time constants correlated with $^{163}$Ho activity were observed, indicating that the excess heat capacity does not introduce weakly coupled thermodynamic systems. These results suggest that our present TES microcalorimeters can tolerate $^{163}$Ho activities up to approximately 5 Bq without significant performance degradation. For higher activities, reducing the TES transition temperature is necessary to maintain energy resolution. These findings provide critical insights for optimizing TES microcalorimeters for future neutrino mass experiments and other applications requiring embedded radioactive sources. The study also highlights the robustness of TES technology in handling implanted radionuclides while maintaining high-resolution performance.\n\n", "2506.13555": "2025-06-16, **Joint analysis of reactor and accelerator CE$\u03bd$NS data on germanium: implications for the Standard Model and nuclear physics**, M.

In this mechanism, the requirement of the existence of a lepton number ($L$) violating process in equilibrium to drive the lepton number requires the temperature of leptogenesis at $\\sim 10^{13}$ GeV. Triplet scalars, due to their interaction with gauge bosons, make a suitable candidate to prevail in the thermal bath via gauge scattering at such high energy. Also, owing to its interaction with Standard Model (SM) leptons and the Higgs scalar, it can mediate $\\Delta L =2$ process. Moreover, just one triplet is enough to serve the purpose as opposed to thermal leptogenesis, where at least one more triplet scalar/right-handed neutrino is required to generate a sizable $CP$ violation. In this work, we study a model where the SM gauge group is extended with $U(1)\\_{\\rm PQ}$, with the addition of one Higgs doublet, one scalar triplet, and one complex scalar singlet. The presence of a complex scalar singlet decouples the PQ symmetry breaking from the electroweak scale. It also provides a common source of an axion-like particle and seesaw scale. The scalar triplet offers a common link between leptogenesis via axion oscillation and neutrino mass. Further, with the presence of one triplet scalar, the lepton flavor violation process is directly determined from low-energy neutrino oscillation data.\n\n", "2506.13310": "2025-06-16, **QCD Axion Conversion in Magnetospheres of Neutron Stars**, Shubham Yadav et.al., [2506.13310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13310v1)\n\n The axion-converted-photons flux is a principal window for searching QCD axions as a dark matter (DM) candidate. In addition to solving the strong CP problem, these may explain the properties of the mysterious DM. Neutron star (NS) cooling by neutrino/axion emissions rate constrains the astrophysical properties of superdense matter. We attempt to analyse the impact of strong magnetic fields on the emission properties of NS by employing the FPS equation of State (EoS). We use the Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) equations by considering effects of strong fields and generating profiles. We assume Cooper-pair-breaking formation (PBF) and the Bremsstrahlung process occur in the core of NS. We adopt a polynomial fit function of radial profile to analyse the effects of strong magnetic field. Our entire analysis is at an axion mass of $15$ meV and central magnetic field $B\\_{c}$=$10^{17}$ G. Our work assumes the core comprises hadronic matter of the spherically symmetric magnetized NSs. We have present the results for the energy spectrum of axions and their subsequent conversion to photons. We show that the cooling rate and the luminosity of axions for NSs change significantly due to the intense magnetic field. We report that the energy spectrum of axions from the Bremsstrahlung process dominates over the PBF process at lesser axion energies, within the possible axion mass range for PSR J1356-6429 NS. Our results reveal that the impact of the magnetic field is less at lower axion energies, indicating the necessity for including a magnetic field in axion-to-photon conversion mechanisms.\n\n", "2506.13289": "2025-06-16, **$0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2$ decay nuclear matrix elements under Left-Right symmetric model from the spherical quasi-particle random phase approximation method with realistic force**, Ri-Guang Huang et.al., [2506.13289v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13289v1)\n\n We perform the calculation of nuclear matrix elements for the neutrinoless double beta decays under a Left-Right symmetric model mediated by light neutrino, and we adopt the spherical quasi-particle random-phase approximation (QRPA) approach with realistic force.

This setup yields a fully flipped inert doublet model. The model naturally realizes a hybrid scotoseesaw mechanism that accounts for the smallness of neutrino masses and the largeness of lepton mixing. Simultaneously, it explains the stability and relic abundance of dark matter through a residual dark parity and addresses the hierarchies of charged fermion masses and the suppression of quark mixing via higher-dimensional operators involving high-scale scalar singlets and vector-like fermions.

Here we investigate this interplay through a detailed analysis of a MW-like galaxy simulation, generated through the self-consistent evolution of gas, stars, and dark matter. We show that our model provides a close match to many of the MW's stellar structure and kinematic features (including in the inner Galaxy, and around the Solar neighbourhood), and find that the stellar spiral pattern in our model is very faint, with significantly less multiplicity than the sharper gaseous arms.If taken as an analogue to the MW, this finding would explain the difficulty in observational studies to agree on the number and location of our Galaxy's spiral arms. We also examine radial and tangential velocity residuals in the disc, and find that sharp kinematic transitions correlate with spiral arms, especially in the gas, where values reach $30 - 50$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$. We find strong radial converging flows promoting spiral-arm growth, while diverging flows disrupt them. A time-resolved analysis of spiral-ridge segments confirms that convergence precedes density enhancements and potential star-forming conditions, while divergence leads to fragmentation and mass redistribution. These patterns evolve on relatively short timescales ($\\sim10-20$\\,Myr), highlighting the transient nature of spiral arms. Our model's spiral arms are dynamically driven, short-lived features shaped by evolving flows, rather than static density waves, which could explain the observed lack of contrast of cloud properties and star formation within and outside spiral arms in the MW.\n\n", "2506.13422": "2025-06-16, **Jet outbursts, non-thermal pressure and the AGN jet duty cycle**, Andrew Sullivan et.al., [2506.13422v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13422v1)\n\n We predict the non-thermal pressure (NTP) induced in the cores of galaxy clusters by kinetic jet feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We model a population of Fanaroff-Riley type I jets when sampling power-law distributions in jet power and age, which we evolve in time with a two-phase jet-lobe model. We couple the energy of each jet outburst to the surrounding gas inside spherical shells, allowing us to estimate the fraction of NTP to total pressure induced in the cluster. We predict the mean profile for this NTP fraction over the source population in a variety of cluster environments and for different AGN jet duty cycles. For typical gas and dark matter profiles, the mean NTP fraction peaks at ~4-6% when the AGN jets are active for 10-30% of the total AGN lifecycle. These predictions are in good agreement with observational constraints, suggesting that AGN feedback imparts only small non-thermal contributions to the cluster's core. Furthermore, we find a relationship between the peak in the mean NTP fraction and the AGN jet duty cycle in a given cluster environment. Applying this to Hitomi measurements of the NTP in the Perseus cluster, we infer an AGN jet duty cycle that is consistent with independent evidence of Perseus' AGN jet activity. We propose this as a novel approach for observationally inferring the past AGN activity of real clusters from their observed NTP fraction and environmental profiles.\n\n", "2506.13352": "2025-06-16, **Scrutinizing the impact of the solar modulation on AMS-02 antiproton excess**, Kai-Kai Duan et.al., [2506.13352v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13352v1)\n\n This study examines the impact of solar modulation on the antiproton excess observed by AMS-02, which may indicate dark matter (DM) annihilation. We analyze three solar modulation models: the force-field approximation (FFA), a time-, charge-, and rigidity-dependent FFA, and a three-dimensional numerical simulation based on the Parker transport equation. Based on AMS-02 latest antiproton data (2025), our results show that the significance of the DM signal is sensitive to the chosen modulation model, with a 2$\\sigma$ signal for the FFA (4$\\sigma$ if including data from H, He, C, O, B/C, and B/O) and a reduced significance for more complex models. We also address systematic uncertainties using two methods: the add-in-quadrature method, which assumes uncorrelated uncertainties between energy bins, and the nuisance parameter method, which treats systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters during the fitting process. Fitted to AMS-02 antiproton data, DM annihilation to the $b\\bar{b}$ scenario with three different solar modulation models shows that the add-in-quadrature method causes overfitting, whereas the nuisance parameters approach leads to underfitting. Statistically, the signal region of the FFA model using the add-in-quadrature method is the most reliable.

Using our general method, we will show how a coherently oscillating scalar field model can represent the CDM sector in the presence of non-minimal coupling of the CDM sector with radiation. Our method is powerful enough to work out the dynamics of gravitational collapse in a closed FLRW spacetime where the coherently oscillating scalar field model represents the CDM sector.
