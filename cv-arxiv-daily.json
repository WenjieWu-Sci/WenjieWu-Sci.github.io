We calculate the contribution to the neutrino background from the non-jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) population following the recent IceCube association of TeV neutrinos with NGC 1068. Methods. We exploit our robust knowledge of the AGN X-ray luminosity function and evolution and convert it to the neutrino band by using NGC 1068 as a benchmark and a theoretically motivated neutrino spectrum. Results. The resulting neutrino background up to redshift 5 does not violate either the IceCube diffuse flux or the upper bounds for non-jetted AGN, although barely so. This is consistent with a scenario where the latter class makes a substantial contribution mostly below 1 PeV, while jetted AGN, i.e. blazars, dominate above this energy, in intriguing agreement with the dip in the neutrino data at ~ 300 TeV. More and better IceCube data on Seyfert galaxies will allow us to constrain the fraction of neutrino emitters among non-jetted AGN.\n\n", "2404.05524": "2024-04-08, **$(g-2)_{e,\u03bc}$ anomalies and decays $h, Z\\to e_b e_a $ in 3-3-1 models with inverse seesaw neutrinos**, T.

In particular, disk galaxies lose gas from their disks and very large tentacles of gas can be formed. Because of the morphology of these stripped galaxies they have been referred to as Jellyfish galaxies. It has been found that star formation is triggered not only in the disk, but also in the tentacles of such Jellyfish galaxies. The observed star forming regions located in the tentacles of those galaxies have been found to be as massive as $3\\times10^7$ M$\\_{\\odot}$ and with sizes $> 100$ pc. Interestingly, these parameters in mass and size agree with those of dwarf galaxies. In this work we make use of the state of the art magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Illustris TNG-50, to study massive jellyfish galaxies with long tentacles. We find that, in the tentacles of TNG-50 Jellyfish galaxies, the star formation regions (gas+stars) formed could be as massive as $\\sim2\\times10^8$ M$\\_{\\odot}$.

Specifically, Nube exhibits an exceptionally low central brightness, with the 2D half-light radius of its stars far exceeding the typical values found in dwarf galaxies, and even surpassing those observed in ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). This phenomenon is difficult to explain within the framework of cold dark matter (CDM). Meanwhile, due to its ultralight particle mass, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) exhibits a de Broglie wavelength on the order of kiloparsecs under the typical velocities of galaxies. The interference between different modes of the FDM wave gives rise to fluctuations in the gravitational field, which can lead to the dynamical heating of stars within galaxies, resulting in an expansion of their spatial distribution. In this paper, we aim to interpret the anomalous stellar distribution observed in Nube as a consequence of the dynamical heating effect induced by FDM. Our findings suggest that a FDM particle mass around $1-2\\times 10^{-23}$ eV can effectively account for this anomaly. And we propose that the FDM dynamical heating effect provides a new insight into understanding the formation of field UDGs.\n\n", "2404.05332": "2024-04-08, **Dark matter phenomenology and phase transition dynamics of the next to minimal composite Higgs model with dilaton**, Borui Zhang et.al., [2404.05332v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05332v1)\n\n In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the Next-to-Minimal Composite Higgs Model (NMCHM) extended with a dilaton field $\\chi$ (denoted as NMCHM$\\_\\chi$). A pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) $\\eta$, resulting from the SO(6)$\\to$SO(5) breaking, serves as a dark matter (DM) candidate. The inclusion of the dilaton field is helpful for evading the stringent constraints from dark matter direct detection, as it allows for an accidental cancellation between the amplitudes of DM-nucleon scattering, an outcome of the mixing between the dilaton and Higgs fields. The presence of the dilaton field also enriches the phase transition patterns in the early universe. We identify two types of phase transitions: (i) a 1-step phase transition, where the chiral symmetry and electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) occur simultaneously, and (ii) a 2-step phase transition, where the chiral symmetry breaking transition takes place first, followed by a second phase transition corresponding to EWSB. Since the first-order phase transitions can be strong due to supercooling in our model, we also examine the stochastic background of gravitational waves generated by these phase transitions.

We describe three different coupling models, one of which turns out to be particularly relevant for cosmology. Its behaviour is similar to that of models in which dark matter decays into dark energy. In particular, for a constant coupling, the model mimics well-known dynamical dark energy models while the non-constant couplings offer a rich dynamical structure, unseen before. We are able to achieve this richness whilst working in a two-dimensional phase space.

However, both modern N-body simulations and observational data suggest that most haloes are either oblate or prolate, and almost never spherical. In this paper we present a modified model of the galaxy correlation function. In addition to the five \"classical\" HOD parameters proposed by Zheng et al. 2007, it includes an additional free parameter $\\phi$ in the modified NFW density profile describing the asymmetry of the host dark matter halo.   Using a subhalo abundance matching model (SHAM), we populate galaxies within BolshoiP N-body simulations. We compute the projected two-point correlation function $w\\_p(r\\_p)$ for six stellar mass volume limited galaxy samples.

One viable methodology for their detection involves the investigation of the line-like radio emissions from the dwarf spheroidal galaxy, potentially originating from the radiative decay of ALPs or the conversion of ALPs in the magnetic field. In this work, we constrain the properties of ALPs using the 2-hour radio observation of Coma Berenices through the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The $\\rm 95\\%$ upper limits of the ALP-photon coupling are calculated for the ALP decay and conversion scenarios, respectively. Note that the sensitive ALP masses for FAST range from $\\sim \\mu \\rm eV$ to tens of $\\mu \\rm eV$, where ALP can explain the DM abundance naturally.

Adopting a simple outflow model, we estimate the mass-, energy- and momentum-loading factors of the ionised outflows, finding modest values with averages of 0.33, 0.04, and 0.22, respectively.

This shallow scaling relation is consistent with these ionised outflows being driven by a combination of mechanical energy generated by supernovae explosions and radiation pressure acting on dusty material.

Numerical radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium show that gas can be driven to high altitudes above the galactic midplane, but the degree of ionization is often less than inferred from observations. For computational expediency, ionizing radiation from massive stars is often included as a post-processing step assuming ionization equilibrium. We extend our simulations of a Milky Way-like interstellar medium to include the combined effect of supernovae and photoionization feedback from midplane OB stars and a population of hot evolved low mass stars. The diffuse ionized gas has densities below 0.1 ${\\rm cm^{-3}}$, so recombination timescales can exceed millions of years. Our simulations now follow the time-dependent ionization and recombination of low density gas. The long recombination timescales result in diffuse ionized gas that persists at large altitudes long after the deaths of massive stars that produce the vast majority of the ionized gas. The diffuse ionized gas does not exhibit the large variability inherent in simulations that adopt ionization equilibrium. The vertical distribution of neutral and ionized gas is close to what is observed in the Milky Way.

The reason this new solution has never been obtained before is that all current time-dependent simulations are initialized with a vacuum dipole configuration that extends to infinity, thus their final steady-state solution also extends to infinity. Under special conditions, such a confined configuration may be attained when the neutron star first forms in the interior of a collapsing star during a supernova explosion, or when it accretes from an external wind or disk from a donor star. It is shown that this new maximally closed non-decelerating solution is the limit of a continuous sequence of standard magnetospheres with open and closed field lines when the amount of open field lines gradually drops to zero. The minimum energy solution in this sequence is a standard magnetosphere in which the closed field line region extends up to about 80% of the light cylinder.

The quest to constrain the Equation of State (EoS) of ultra-dense matter and thereby probe the behavior of matter inside neutron stars, is one of the core goals of modern physics and astrophysics. A promising method involves investigating the long-term cooling of neutron stars, and comparing theoretical predictions with various sources at different ages. However, limited observational data, and uncertainties in source ages and distances, have hindered this approach. In this work, re-analyzing XMM-Newton and Chandra data from dozens of thermally emitting isolated neutron stars, we have identified three sources with unexpectedly cold surface temperatures for their young ages. To investigate these anomalies, we conducted magneto-thermal simulations across diverse mass and magnetic fields, considering three different EoS. We found that the \"minimal\" cooling model, failed to explain the observations, regardless the mass and the magnetic field, as validated by a machine learning classification method.

Here we present our Monte-Carlo simulation of RS effect on X-ray resonant-line emission, typified by O VII He$\\alpha$ r line, from SNRs. We employ the physical conditions characterized by the Sedov-Taylor solution and some basic parameters similar to those in Cygnus Loop. We show that the impact of RS effect is most significant near the edge of the remnant.

Sherman et.al., [2404.05135v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05135v1)\n\n Core-collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) are considered to be the primary magnetar formation channel, with 15 magnetars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs). A large fraction of these should occur in massive stellar binaries that are disrupted by the explosion, meaning that $\\sim45\\%$ of magnetars should be nearby high-velocity stars. Here we conduct a multi-wavelength search for unbound stars, magnetar binaries, and SNR shells using public optical ($uvgrizy-$bands), infrared ($J-$, $H-$, $K-$, and $K\\_s-$bands), and radio ($888$ MHz, $1.4$ GHz, and $3$ GHz) catalogs. We use Monte Carlo analyses of candidates to estimate the probability of association with a given magnetar based on their proximity, distance, proper motion, and magnitude. In addition to recovering a proposed magnetar binary, a proposed unbound binary, and 13 of 15 magnetar SNRs, we identify two new candidate unbound systems: an OB star from the Gaia catalog we associate with SGR J1822.3-1606, and an X-ray pulsar we associate with 3XMM J185246.6+003317. Using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation that assumes all magnetars descend from CCSNe, we constrain the fraction of magnetars with unbound companions to $5\\lesssim f\\_u \\lesssim 24\\%$, which disagrees with population synthesis results. Alternate formation channels are unlikely to wholly account for the lack of unbound binaries as this would require $31\\lesssim f\\_{nc} \\lesssim 66\\%$ of magnetars to descend from such channels. Our results support a high fraction ($48\\lesssim f\\_m \\lesssim 86\\%$) of pre-CCSN mergers, which can amplify fossil magnetic fields to preferentially form magnetars.\n\n", "2404.04835": "2024-04-07, **A born ultramassive white dwarf-hot subdwarf super-Chandrasekhar candidate**, Changqing Luo et.al., [2404.04835v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04835v1)\n\n Although supernovae is a well-known endpoint of an accreting white dwarf, alternative theoretical possibilities has been discussing broadly, such as the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) event as the endpoint of oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarfs, either accreting up to or merging to excess the Chandrasekhar limit (the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf). AIC is an important channel to form neutron stars, especially for those unusual systems, which are hardly produced by core-collapse supernovae. However, the observational evidences for this theoretical predicted event and its progenitor are all very limited. In all of the known progenitors, white dwarfs increase in mass by accretion. Here, we report the discovery of an intriguing binary system Lan 11, consisted of a stripped core-helium-burning hot subdwarf and an unseen compact object of 1.08 to 1.35 $M\\_{\\odot}$. Our binary population synthesis calculations, along with the absence of detection from the deep radio observations of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope, strongly suggest that the latter is an ONe white dwarf. The total mass of this binary is 1.67 to 1.92 $M\\_{\\odot}$}, significantly excessing the Chandrasekhar limit. The reproduction of its evolutionary history indicates that the unique system has undergone two phases of common envelope ejections, implying a born nature of this massive ONe white dwarf rather than an accretion growth from its companion. These results, together with short orbital period of this binary (3.65 hours), suggest that this system will merge in 500-540 Myr, largely triggering an AIC event, although the possibility of type Ia supernova cannot be fully ruled out. This finding greatly provides valuable constraints on our understanding of stellar endpoints, whatever leading to an AIC or a supernova.\n\n", "2404.04786": "2024-04-07, **Reconciling the HESS J1731-347 constraints with Parity doublet model**, Bikai Gao et.al., [2404.04786v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04786v1)\n\n The recent discovery of a central compact object (CCO) within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, characterized by a mass of approximately $0.77^{+0.20}\\_{-0.17} M\\_{\\odot}$ and a radius of about $10.4^{+0.86}\\_{-0.78}$ km, has opened up a new window for the study of compact objects. This CCO is particularly intriguing because it is the lightest and smallest compact object ever observed, raising questions and challenging the existing theories. To account for this light compact star, a mean-field model within the framework of parity doublet structure is applied to describe the hadron matter. Inside the model, part of the nucleon mass is associated with the chiral symmetry breaking while the other part is from the chiral invariant mass $m\\_0$ which is insensitive to the temperature/density. The value of $m\\_0$ affects the nuclear equation of state for uniform nuclear matter at low density and exhibits strong correlations with the radii of neutron stars.

Based on the separate ~1 Ms deep XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we report the discovery of the thermally-emitting plasma in some portions of the western half of 30 Dor C. The thermal emission can be reproduced by a collisional-ionization-equilibrium plasma model with an average electron temperature of ~0.4 keV. We find a significant overabundance of the intermediate-mass elements such as O, Ne, Mg, and Si, which may be indicative of a recent supernova explosion in 30 Dor C. Dynamical properties in combination with the information of the OB association LH 90 suggest that the internal post-main-sequence stars dominate the power of the superbubble and blow it out in the past ~1 Myr.\n\n"}}
