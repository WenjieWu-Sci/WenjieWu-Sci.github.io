<p>2023-07-10, <strong>Atmospheric muons at PeV energies in radio neutrino detectors</strong>, Lilly Pyras et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04736v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04736v1</a></p>

<p>Experiments seeking to detect radio emission stemming from neutrino interactions will soon reach sensitivities that bring a detection within reach. Since experiments like RNO-G or the future IceCube-Gen2 target more than an order of magnitude more effective volume than existing experiments, the renewed and detailed study of rare backgrounds is needed. In this paper, we study the potential background from energy losses of highly energetic atmospheric muons. Due to both limited experimental measurements and limited modeling in hadronic interaction models, the expected event rate is subject to large uncertainties. Here, we estimate rate predictions and their uncertainties for different models and instrumental parameters. We also study possible routes towards mitigation, such as parent air shower detection, and illustrate what is needed to make the first measurement of the prompt muon flux at energies above 10 PeV.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>Sphaleron in the Higgs Triplet Model</strong>, Jiahang Hu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04713v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04713v1</a></p>

<p>The Higgs triplet model (HTM) extends the Standard Model (SM) by one complex triplet scalar (also known as the type-II seesaw model), offering a simple and viable way to account for nonzero neutrino masses. On the other hand, the nontrivial couplings of the triplet to the gauge fields and to the SM Higgs field are expected to influence the topological vacuum structure of the SM, and consequently, the energy and the field configuration of the electroweak sphaleron. The sphaleron process plays a crucial role in dynamically generating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this work, we study the vacuum structure of the gauge and Higgs fields and calculate the saddle-point sphaleron configuration in the HTM. The coupled nonlinear equations of motion of the sphaleron are solved using the spectral method. We find the inclusion of the triplet scalar could in principle significantly change the sphaleron energy compared with the SM. Nevertheless, at zero temperature, the current stringent experimental constraint on the vacuum expectation value of the triplet suppresses the difference. Interestingly, we find that there still exists some narrow parameter space where the sphaleron energy can be enhanced up to $30\%$ compared with the SM case.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>Supercooling in Radiative Symmetry Breaking: Theory Extensions, Gravitational Wave Detection and Primordial Black Holes</strong>, Alberto Salvio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04694v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04694v1</a></p>

<p>First-order phase transitions, which take place when the symmetries are predominantly broken (and masses are then generated) through radiative corrections, produce observable gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We provide a model-independent approach that is valid for large-enough supercooling to quantitatively describe these phenomena in terms of few parameters, which are computable once the model is specified. The validity of a previously-proposed approach of this sort is extended here to a larger class of theories. Among other things, we identify regions of the parameter space that correspond to the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, PPTA) and others that are either excluded by the observing runs of LIGO and Virgo or within the reach of future gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, we find regions of the parameter space where primordial black holes produced by large over-densities due to such phase transitions can account for dark matter. Finally, it is shown how this model-independent approach can be applied to specific cases, including a phenomenological completion of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ undergoing radiative symmetry breaking.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>Metastable cosmic strings</strong>, Wilfried Buchmuller et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04691v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04691v1</a></p>

<p>Many symmetry breaking patterns in grand unified theories (GUTs) give rise to cosmic strings that eventually decay when pairs of GUT monopoles spontaneously nucleate along the string cores. These strings are known as metastable cosmic strings and have intriguing implications for particle physics and cosmology. In this article, we discuss the current status of metastable cosmic strings, with a focus on possible GUT embeddings and connections to inflation, neutrinos, and gravitational waves (GWs). The GW signal emitted by a network of metastable cosmic strings in the early universe differs, in particular, from the signal emitted by topologically stable strings by a suppression at low frequencies. Therefore, if the underlying symmetry breaking scale is close to the GUT scale, the resulting GW spectrum can be accessible at current ground-based interferometers as well as at future space-based interferometers, such as LISA, and at the same time account for the signal in the most recent pulsar timing data sets. Metastable cosmic strings thus nourish the hope that future GW observations might shed light on fundamental physics close to the GUT scale.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>The Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein Matter Potential at the One-loop Level in the Standard Model</strong>, Jihong Huang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04685v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04685v1</a></p>

<p>When neutrinos are propagating in ordinary matter, their coherent forward scattering off background particles results in the so-called Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) matter potential, which plays an important role in neutrino flavor conversions. In this paper, we present a complete one-loop calculation of the MSW matter potential in the Standard Model (SM). First, we carry out the one-loop renormalization of the SM in the on-shell scheme, where the electromagnetic fine-structure constant $\alpha$, the weak gauge-boson masses $m^{}_W$ and $m^{}_Z$, the Higgs-boson mass $m^{}_h$ and the fermion masses $m^{}_f$ are chosen as input parameters. Then, the finite corrections to the scattering amplitudes of neutrinos with the electrons and quarks are calculated, and the one-loop MSW matter potentials are derived. Adopting the latest values of all physical parameters, we find that the relative size of one-loop correction to the charged-current matter potential of electron-type neutrinos or antineutrinos turns out to be $6\%$, whereas that to the neutral-current matter potential of all-flavor neutrinos or antineutrinos can be as large as $8\%$. The implications of such corrections for neutrino oscillations are briefly discussed.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>M1 neutrino transport within the numerical-relativistic code BAM with application to low mass binary neutron star mergers</strong>, Federico Schianchi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04572v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04572v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino interactions are essential for an accurate understanding of the binary neutron star merger process. In this article, we extend the code infrastructure of the well-established numerical-relativity code BAM that until recently neglected neutrino-driven interactions. In fact, while previous work allowed already the usage of nuclear-tabulated equations of state and employing a neutrino leakage scheme, we are moving forward by implementing a first-order multipolar radiation transport scheme (M1) for the advection of neutrinos. After testing our implementation on a set of standard scenarios, we apply it to the evolution of four low-mass binary systems, and we perform an analysis of ejecta properties. We also show that our new ejecta analysis infrastructure is able to provide numerical relativity-informed inputs for the codes $\texttt{POSSIS}$ and $\texttt{Skynet}$, for the computation of kilonova lightcurves and nucleosynthesis yields, respectively.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>Exploring Non-Standard Quark Interactions through Solar Neutrino Studies</strong>, IlÃ­dio Lopes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04557v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04557v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the effects of a Non-Standard Interaction (NSI) extension of the standard model of particle physics on solar neutrino flavour oscillations. This NSI model introduces a $U_{Z^\prime}(1)$ gauge symmetry through a $Z^\prime$ boson that mixes with the photon, creating a neutral current between active neutrinos and matter fields via a unique coupling to up and down quarks. The interaction is defined by a single parameter, $\zeta_o$, which is related to the $Z^\prime$ bosonâs mass $m_{Z^\prime}$ and coupling constant $g_{Z^\prime}$. Notably, this model relaxes the bounds on Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering experiments and fits the experimental values of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon. In this study, we use solar neutrino measurements and an up-to-date standard solar model to evaluate the neutrino flavour oscillations and assess the constraints on $\zeta_o$. Our study indicates that the NSI model aligns with the current solar neutrino data when $\zeta_o$ is between $-0.7$ and $0.002$. These models have $\chi^2_{\nu}$ values equal to or better than the standard neutrino flavor oscillation model, which stands at a $\chi^2_{\nu}$ of 3.12. The best NSI model comes with a $\zeta_o$ value of -0.2 and a $\chi^2_{\nu}$ of 2.96. Including extra data from the Darwin experiment in our analysis refines the range of $\zeta_o$ values from $-0.7$ to $0.002$, down to $-0.5$ to $-0.002$. These results hint at the possible existence of novel interactions, given that NSI models achieve a comparable or superior fit to the solar neutrino data when contrasted with the prevailing standard model of neutrino flavour oscillation.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>Distinguishing between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos using temporal correlations</strong>, Bhavya Soni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04496v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04496v1</a></p>

<p>In the context of two flavour neutrino oscillations, it is understood that the $2\times 2$ mixing matrix is parameterized by one angle and a Majorana phase. However, this phase does not impact the oscillation probabilities in vacuum or in matter with constant density. Interestingly, the Majorana phase becomes relevant when we describe neutrino oscillations along with neutrino decay. This is due to the fact that effective Hamiltonian has Hermitian and anti-Hermitian components which cannot be simultaneously diagonalized (resulting in decay eigenstates being different from the mass eigenstates). We consider the $\cal PT$ symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing two flavour neutrino case and study the violation of Leggett-Garg Inequalities (LGI) in this context for the first time. We demonstrate that temporal correlations in the form of LGI allow us to probe whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana. We elucidate the role played by the mixing and decay parameters on the extent of violation of LGI. We emphasize that for optimized choice of parameters, the difference in $K_4$ ($K_3$) for Dirac and Majorana case is $\sim 15\%$ ($\sim 10\%$).</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>Observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Galactic plane</strong>, R. Abbasi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04427v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04427v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of high-energy cosmic rays, atomic nuclei that continuously impact Earthâs atmosphere, has been a mystery for over a century. Due to deflection in interstellar magnetic fields, cosmic rays from the Milky Way arrive at Earth from random directions. However, near their sources and during propagation, cosmic rays interact with matter and produce high-energy neutrinos. We search for neutrino emission using machine learning techniques applied to ten years of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We identify neutrino emission from the Galactic plane at the 4.5$\sigma$ level of significance, by comparing diffuse emission models to a background-only hypothesis. The signal is consistent with modeled diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, but could also arise from a population of unresolved point sources.</p>

<p>2023-07-09, <strong>A Search for AGN sources of the IceCube Diffuse Neutrino Flux</strong>, K. McDonough et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04194v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04194v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux measured by the IceCube Observatory remains largely unknown. Although NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 have been identified as potential neutrino sources, the diffuse flux of neutrinos must have additional sources that have not yet been identified. Here we investigate potential correlations between IceCubeâs neutrino events and the Fermi and MOJAVE source catalogs, using the publicly-available IceCube data set. We perform three separate spatially-dependent, energy-dependent, and time-dependent searches, and find no statistically significant sources outside of NGC 1068. We find that no more than 13% of IceCubeâs neutrino flux originates from blazars over the whole sky. Then, using an energy-dependent likelihood analysis, the limit on neutrinos originating from blazars reduces to 9% in the Northern hemisphere. Finally, we set limits on individual sources from the MOJAVE radio catalog after finding no statistically significant time-flaring sources.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>Particle production from non-minimal coupling in a symmetry breaking potential transporting vacuum energy</strong>, Alessio Belfiglio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04739v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04739v1</a></p>

<p>We propose an inflationary scenario where the inflaton field is non-minimally coupled to spacetime curvature and inflation is driven by a vacuum energy symmetry breaking potential without specifying \emph{a priori} whether the inflaton field is small or large. As we incorporate vacuum energy into our analysis, we further explore the implications of a non-zero potential offset in relation to the emergence of inflationary dynamics. Thus, we propose that vacuum energy can transform into particles as a result of the transition triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking. This entails a vacuum energy cancellation that yields an effective cosmological constant during inflation by virtue of a quasi-de Sitter evolution and shows that the vacuum energy contribution can manifest as \emph{geometric particles} produced by inflaton fluctuations, with particular emphasis on super-Hubble modes. We conjecture these particles as \emph{quasi-particles} arising from interaction between the inflaton and spacetime geometry, enhanced by non-minimal coupling. Specifically, we propose that dark matter arises from a pure geometric quasi-particle contribution, and we quantify the corresponding dark matter candidate ranges of mass. In this scenario, we further find that a zero potential offset leads to a bare cosmological constant at the end of inflation, while a negative offset would require an additional kinetic (or potential) contribution in order to be fully-canceled. In this regard, we conclude that the scenario of large field inflaton is preferred since it necessitates a more appropriate selection of the offset. Our conclusion is reinforced as small field inflaton would lead to a significant screening of the Newtonian gravitational constant as inflation ends.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>Unveiling the Graviton Mass Bounds through Analysis of 2023 Pulsar Timing Array Datasets</strong>, Sai Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04680v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04680v1</a></p>

<p>Strong evidence for the Helling-Downs correlations have been reported by several pulsar timing array collaborations in middle 2023. In this work, we study the state-of-the-art graviton mass bounds by analyzing the observational data of overlap ruduction functions from NANOGrav 15-year data release and CPTA first data release. The data analysis places upper limits on the graviton mass at 95\% confidence level, namely, $m_{g}\lesssim0.43\times10^{-23}\mathrm{eV}$ for NANOGrav and $m_{g}\lesssim0.57\times10^{-23}\mathrm{eV}$ for CPTA. In addition, we discuss implications of these results for scenarios of ultralight tensor dark matter.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>Baryogenesis and Dark Matter in the Mirror Twin Higgs</strong>, Pedro Bittar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04662v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04662v1</a></p>

<p>We consider a natural asymmetric dark matter (ADM) model in the mirror twin Higgs (MTH). We show that it is possible to obtain the correct dark matter (DM) abundance when a twin baryon is the DM without the need of explicit breaking of the MTH $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in the dimensionless couplings (i.e. without hard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking). We illustrate how this is possible in a specific baryogenesis setup, which also leads to ADM. In the simplest scenario we obtain $m_{\rm DM}\sim O(1)$~GeV, just above the proton mass. We show estimates for direct detection rates at present and future experiments.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>Dark Matter in Fractional Gravity II: Tests in Galaxy Clusters</strong>, Francesco Benetti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04655v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04655v1</a></p>

<p>[abridged] Recently, in Benetti et al. (Astrophys. J. 2023, 949, 65), we suggested that the dark matter (DM) component in galaxies may originate fractional gravity. In such a framework, the DM component exists, but the gravitational potential associated to its density distribution is determined by a modified Poisson equation including fractional derivatives, which are meant to describe nonlocal effects. In Benetti et al., we showed that fractional gravity worked very well for reproducing the kinematics of disk-dominated galaxies, especially dwarfs; there is also preliminary evidence that the strength of fractional effects tends to weaken toward more massive systems. Here, we aim to test fractional gravity in galaxy clusters, with a twofold aim: (i) perform an independent sanity check that it can accurately describe such large and massive structures; (ii) derive a clear-cut trend for its strength in systems with different DM masses. To this purpose, we forward model the density and pressure distributions of the intracluster medium (ICM), working out the hydrostatic equilibrium equation in fractional gravity. Then, we perform a Bayesian analysis of the X-COP galaxy cluster sample and infer constraints on the fractional gravity parameters, for individual clusters as well as stacked clusters. We find that fractional gravity performs remarkably well in modeling the ICM profiles for the X-COP sample. We also confirm the weakening of the fractional gravity effects toward more massive systems and derive the overall scaling of the fractional gravity parameters from dwarf galaxies to massive clusters, spanning six orders of magnitude in DM mass. Such an overall trend implies that fractional gravity can substantially alleviate the small-scale issues of the standard DM paradigm, while remaining successful on large cosmological scales.</p>

<p>2023-07-10, <strong>NANOGrav spectral index $Î³=3$ from melting domain walls</strong>, E. Babichev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04582v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04582v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss cosmic domain walls described by a tension red-shifting with the expansion of the Universe. These melting domain walls emit gravitational waves (GW) with the low-frequency spectral shape $\Omega_{gw}\propto f^{2}$ corresponding to the spectral index $\gamma=3$ favoured by the recent NANOGrav 15 yrs data. We discuss a concrete high-energy physics scenario proposed in Refs. [1,2] which leads to such a melting domain wall network in the early Universe. This scenario involves a feebly coupled scalar field $\chi$, which can serve as a promising dark matter candidate. We identify parameters of the model matching the GW characteristics observed in the NANOGrav data. The dark matter mass is pushed to the ultra-light range below $10^{-11}-10^{-12}\,\text{eV}$ which is accessible through planned observations thanks to the effects of superradiance of rotating black holes.</p>

<p>Recent observations of weak gravitational lensing surveys indicate a smoother Universe compared to the predictions of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This is known as $\sigma_8$ tension or $S_8$ tension, where $\sigma_8$ represents the present root-mean-square matter fluctuation averaged over a sphere of radius $8 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$ and $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$. In this letter, we investigate a kind of general Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) Lagrangian referred as surface-type DBI (s-DBI) model. We have found that, up to the linear order, the constraints on the s-DBI model with CMB from Planck2018 and low-redshift probes (WL and GC) yield $S_8= 0.7685_{-0.0066}^{+0.0077}$ and $S_8=0.766_{-0.0376}^{+0.0471}$, respectively, which are not only self-consistent but also consistent with the values derived from most low-redshift probes. Furthermore, we provide an outlook for searching the non-linear effects of this model, which could be helpful to resolve other issues by Cold Dark Matter on small scales.</p>

<p>The Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm is applied to the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis using the known analytic expressions for the expansion factor $a$ and the plasma temperature $T$ as functions of the SIV time $\tau$ since the Big-Bang when $a(\tau=0)=0$. The results are compared to the known standard BBNS model as calculated with the PRIMAT code. Potential SIV-guided deviations from the local statistical equilibrium are explored. Overall, we find that smaller than usual baryon and non-zero dark matter content, by a factor of three to five times reduction, result in compatible to the standard reproduction of the light elements abundances.</p>

<p>2023-07-09, <strong>Sub-TeV superpartners may be observable, with reduced cross-sections and modified experimental signatures</strong>, Roland E. Allen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04255v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04255v1</a></p>

<p>In a reinterpretation of all scalar boson sectors, most of the conventional processes for production, decay, and detection of sfermions are excluded, and the same is true for many processes involving gauginos and higgsinos. This implies that sub-TeV superpartners may exist, but with reduced cross-sections and modified experimental signatures. For example, a top squark (as redefined here) will not decay at all, but can radiate gauge bosons and will have second-order interactions with detectors. The predictions of the present theory include the dark matter candidate of our previous papers, many new fermions with masses not far above 1 TeV, and the full range of superpartners with a modified phenomenology. All of these may be observable in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>2023-07-09, <strong>Heavy axions from twin dark sectors with $\barÎ¸$-characterized mirror symmetry</strong>, Pei-Hong Gu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04236v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04236v1</a></p>

<p>The QCD Lagrangian contains a CP violating gluon density term with a physical coefficient $\bar{\theta}$. The upper bound on the electric dipole moment of neutron implies that the value of $\bar{\theta}$ should be extremely small rather than the theoretically expected order of unity. The tiny $\bar{\theta}$ is commonly known as the strong CP problem. In order to solve this puzzle, we construct a $\bar{\theta}$-characterized mirror symmetry between a pair of twin dark sectors with respective discrete symmetries. By taking a proper phase rotation of dark fields, we can perfectly remove the parameter $\bar{\theta}$ from the full Lagrangian. In our scenario, the discrete symmetry breaking, which are responsible for the mass generation of dark colored fermions and dark matter fermions, can be allowed near the TeV scale. This means different phenomena from the popular axion models with high scale Peccei-Quinn global symmetry breaking.</p>

<p>2023-07-09, <strong>The 21-cm forest as a simultaneous probe of dark matter and cosmic heating history</strong>, Yue Shao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04130v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.04130v1</a></p>

<p>The absorption features in spectra of high-redshift background radio sources, caused by hyperfine structure lines of hydrogen atoms in the intervening structures, are known collectively as the 21-cm forest. They provide a unique probe of small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization, and can be used to constrain the properties of the dark matter (DM) thought to govern small-scale structure formation. However, the signals are easily suppressed by heating processes that are degenerate with a warm DM model. Here we propose a probe of both the DM particle mass and the heating history of the Universe, using the one-dimensional power spectrum of the 21-cm forest. The one-dimensional power spectrum measurement not only breaks the DM model degeneracy but also increases the sensitivity, making the probe actually feasible. Making 21-cm forest observations with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array has the potential to simultaneously determine both the DM particle mass and the heating level in the early Universe, shedding light on the nature of DM and the first galaxies.</p>
