<p>2023-06-22, <strong>Disentangle Neutrino Electromagnetic Properties with Atomic Radiative Pair Emission</strong>, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12953v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12953v1</a></p>

<p>We elaborate the possibility of using the atomic radiative emission of neutrino pair (RENP) to probe the neutrino electromagnetic properties, including magnetic and electric dipole moments, charge radius, and anapole. With the typical O(eV) momentum transfer, the atomic RENP is sensitive to not just the tiny neutrino masses but also very light mediators to which the massless photon belongs. The neutrino EM properties introduce extra contribution besides the SM one induced by the heavy W/Z gauge bosons. Since the associated photon spectrum is divided into several sections whose boundaries are determined by the final-state neutrino masses, it is possible to identify the individual neutrino EM form factor elements. Most importantly, scanning the photon spectrum inside the particular section with deviation from the SM prediction once observed allows identification of the neutrino EM form factor type. The RENP provides an ultimate way of disentangling the neutrino EM properties to go beyond the current experimental searches or observations.</p>

<p>2023-06-22, <strong>Possible contribution of X-ray binary jets to the Galactic cosmic ray and neutrino flux</strong>, Dimitrios Kantzas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12715v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12715v1</a></p>

<p>For over a century, the identification of high-energy cosmic ray (CR) sources remains an open question. For Galactic CRs with energy up to $10^{15}$ eV, supernova remnants (SNRs) have traditionally been thought the main candidate source. However, recent TeV gamma-ray observations have questioned the SNR paradigm. Propagating CRs are deflected by the Galactic magnetic field, hence, gamma-rays and neutrinos produced via inelastic hadronic interactions are the only means for unveiling the CR sources. In this work, we study the gamma-ray and neutrino emission produced by CRs accelerated inside Galactic jets of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries (BHXBs). We calculate the intrinsic neutrino emission of two prototypical BHXBs, Cygnus X-1 and GX 339-4, for which we have high-quality, quasi-simultaneous multiwavelength spectra. Based on these prototypical sources, we discuss the likelihood of the 35 known Galactic BHXBs to be efficient CR accelerators. Moreover, we estimate the potential contribution to the CR spectrum of a viable population of BHXBs that reside in the Galactic plane. When these BHXBs go into outburst, they may accelerate particles up to 100s of TeV that contribute to the diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino spectra while propagating in the Galactic medium. Using HERMES, an open-source code that calculates the hadronic processes along the line of sight, we discuss the contribution of BHXBs to the diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, and compare these to their intrinsic gamma-ray and neutrino emissions. Finally, we discuss the contribution of BHXBs to the observed spectrum of Galactic CRs.</p>

<p>The CTEQ-TEA Collaboration has calculated neutrino-nucleon cross sections, based on CTEQ18 NNLO parton distribution functions.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>Tree-level UV completions for $N_R$SMEFT $d=6$ and $d=7$ operators</strong>, Rebeca Beltrán et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12578v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12578v1</a></p>

<p>We study ultra-violet completions for operators in standard model effective field theory extended with right-handed neutrinos ($N_R$SMEFT). Using a diagrammatic method, we generate systematically lists of possible tree-level completions involving scalars, fermions or vectors for all operators at $d=6$ and $d=7$, which contain at least one right-handed neutrino. We compare our lists of possible UV models to the ones found for pure SMEFT. We also discuss how the observation of LNV processes via $N_R$SMEFT operators at the LHC can be related to Majorana neutrino masses of the standard model neutrinos.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>A boosted muon collider</strong>, Daniele Barducci et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12480v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12480v1</a></p>

<p>A muon collider could produce the heavier Standard Model particles with a boost, for example in resonant processes such as $\mu^-\mu^+\to h$ or $\mu^-\mu^+\to Z$. We discuss possible geometries that produce the boost (asymmetric beam energies, tilted beams) and estimate how much the luminosity is reduced or perhaps enhanced. The boost provides new observational opportunities. For example it can significantly enhance the sensitivity to long-lived new particles decaying in a far-away detector, such as dark higgses or sterile neutrinos produced in $h$ or $Z$ decays.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>Best-case scenarios for neutrino capture experiments</strong>, Kyrylo Bondarenko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12366v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12366v1</a></p>

<p>A direct discovery of the cosmic neutrino background would bring to a closure the searches for relic left-over radiation predicted by the Hot Big Bang cosmology. Recently, the KATRIN experiment put a limit on the local relic neutrino overdensity with respect to the cosmological predicted average value at $\eta \lesssim 10^{11}$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 011806 (2022)]. In this work, we first examine to what extent such values of $\eta$ are conceivable. We show that even under cavalier assumptions, a cosmic origin of $\eta \gtrsim 10^4$ seems out of reach (with the caveat of forming bound objects under a new force,) but find that a hypothetical local source of low-energy neutrinos could achieve $\eta \sim 10^{11}$. Second, when such values are considered, we point out that the experimental signature in KATRIN and other neutrino-capture experiments changes, contrary to what has hitherto been assumed. Our results are model-independent and maximally accommodating as they only assume the Pauli exclusion principle. As intermittent physics target in the quest for C$\nu$B detection, we identify an experimental sensitivity to $\eta \sim 10^4$ for which conceivable sources exist; to resolve the effect of a degenerate Fermi gas for such overdensity an energy resolution of 10 meV is required.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>Light dark matter search with DarkSide-50</strong>, D. Franco et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12151v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12151v1</a></p>

<p>We present the latest results from the search for light dark matter particle interactions with the DarkSide-50 dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber. This analysis, based on the ionization signal only, improves the existing limits for spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interactions in the $[1.2, 3.6]$ GeV/c$^2$ mass range. The sensitivity is extended down to 40 MeV/c$^2$ by assuming the Migdal effect, responsible for an additional ionization signal from the recoiling atom. Finally, we set new constraints to interactions of dark matter particles with electrons in the final state, namely WIMPs, galactic axions, dark photons, and sterile neutrinos.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>Left-Right Symmetry at FCC-hh</strong>, Miha Nemevšek et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12104v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12104v1</a></p>

<p>We study the production of right-handed $W_R$ bosons and heavy neutrinos $N$ at a future 100 TeV high energy hadron collider in the context of Left-Right symmetry, including the effects of $W_L-W_R$ gauge-boson mixing. We estimate the collider reach for up to 3/ab integrated luminosity using a multi-binned sensitivity measure. In the Keung-Senjanovi'c and missing energy channels, the 3$\sigma$ sensitivity extends up to $M_{W_R}=35$ and 37 TeV, respectively. We further clarify the interplay between the missing energy channel and the (expected) limits from neutrinoless double beta decay searches, Big Bang nucleosynthesis and dark matter.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>Paarl Africa Underground Laboratory (PAUL)</strong>, Robert Adam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12083v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12083v1</a></p>

<p>Establishing a deep underground physics laboratory to study, amongst others, double beta decay, geoneutrinos, reactor neutrinos and dark matter has been discussed for more than a decade within the austral African physicists’ community. PAUL, the Paarl Africa Underground Laboratory, is an initiative foreseeing an open international laboratory devoted to the development of competitive science in the austral region. It has the advantage that the location, the Huguenot tunnel, exists already and the geology and the environment of the site is appropriate for an experimental facility. The paper describes the PAUL initiative, presents the physics prospects and discusses the capacity for building the future experimental facility.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>Superscaling in the resonance region for neutrino-nucleus scattering: The SuSAv2-DCC model</strong>, J. Gonzalez-Rosa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12060v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12060v1</a></p>

<p>In this work the SuSAv2 and dynamical coupled-channels (DCC) models have been combined and tested in the inelastic regime for electron and neutrino reactions on nuclei. The DCC model, an approach to study baryon resonances through electron and neutrino induced meson production reactions, has been implemented for the first time in the SuSAv2-inelastic model to analyze the resonance region. Within this framework, we also present a novel description about other inelasticities in the resonance region (SoftDIS). The outcomes of these approaches are firstly benchmarked against (e,e’) data on 12C. The description is thus extended to the study of neutrino-nucleus inclusive cross sections on 12C and 40Ar and compared with data from the T2K, MicroBooNE, ArgoNEUT and MINERvA experiments, thus covering a wide kinematical range.</p>

<p>2023-06-22, <strong>Freeze-in at stronger coupling</strong>, Catarina Cosme et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13061v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.13061v1</a></p>

<p>Predictivity of many non-thermal dark matter (DM) models is marred by the gravitational production background. This problem is ameliorated in models with lower reheating temperature $T_R$, which allows for dilution of gravitationally produced relics. We study the freeze-in dark matter production mechanism in the thermal bath with the electroweak scale temperature. The process is Boltzmann-suppressed if the dark matter mass is above $T_R$. In this case, the coupling to the thermal bath has to be significant to account for the observed dark matter relic density. As a result, the direct DM detection experiments already probe such freeze-in models, excluding significant parts of parameter space. The forthcoming experiments will explore this framework further, extending to lower couplings and higher reheating temperatures.</p>

<p>2023-06-22, <strong>Methodological Reflections on the MOND/Dark Matter Debate</strong>, Patrick M. Duerr et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13026v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.13026v1</a></p>

<p>The paper re-examines the principal methodological questions, arising in the debate over the cosmological standard model’s postulate of Dark Matter vs. rivalling proposals that modify standard (Newtonian and general-relativistic) gravitational theory, the so-called Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and its subsequent extensions. What to make of such seemingly radical challenges of cosmological orthodoxy? In the first part of our paper, we assess MONDian theories through the lens of key ideas of major 20th century philosophers of science (Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos, and Laudan), thereby rectifying widespread misconceptions and misapplications of these ideas common in the pertinent MOND-related literature. None of these classical methodological frameworks, which render precise and systematise the more intuitive judgements prevalent in the scientific community, yields a favourable verdict on MOND and its successors – contrary to claims in the MOND-related literature by some of these theories’ advocates; the respective theory appraisals are largely damning. Drawing on these insights, the paper’s second part zooms in on the most common complaint about MONDian theories, their ad-hocness. We demonstrate how the recent coherentist model of ad-hocness captures, and fleshes out, the underlying – but too often insufficiently articulated – hunches underlying this critique. MONDian theories indeed come out as severely ad hoc: they do not cohere well with either theoretical or empirical-factual background knowledge. In fact, as our complementary comparison with the cosmological standard model’s Dark Matter postulate shows, with respect to ad-hocness, MONDian theories fare worse than the cosmological standard model.</p>

<p>2023-06-22, <strong>Collider Signatures of Near-Continuum Dark Matter</strong>, Steven Ferrante et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13009v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.13009v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper we study a near-continuum dark matter model, in which dark sector consists of a tower of closely spaced states with weak-scale masses. We construct a five-dimensional model which naturally realizes this spectrum. The dark matter is described by a bulk field, which interacts with the brane-localized Standard Model sector via a Z portal. We then study collider signatures of this model. Near-continuum dark matter states produced in a collider undergo cascade decays, resulting in events with high multiplicity of jets and leptons, large missing energy, and displaced vertices. A custom-built Monte Carlo tool described in this paper allows for detailed simulation of the signal events. We present results of such simulations for the case of electron-positron collisions.</p>

<p>2023-06-22, <strong>Reviving sub-TeV $SU(2)_L$ lepton doublet Dark Matter</strong>, Purusottam Ghosh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12906v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12906v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we study the hybrid kind of dark matter(DM) production mechanism where both thermal and non-thermal contribution at two different epochs set the DM relic abundance. This hybrid set up in turn shifts the parameter space of DM in contrast to pure thermal DM scenario. We review such production mechanism in the context of the $SU(2)_L$ lepton doublet dark matter ($\Psi$) augmented with an additional singlet dark scalar ($S$). The neutral component of the dark doublet can serve as a stable DM candidate and in pure thermal scenario, it is under-abundant as well as excluded from direct detection constraints due to its strong gauge interactions in the sub-TeV mass regime. However, in addition to the thermal contribution, the late time non-thermal DM production from the decay of the long-lived dark scalar $S$ helps to fulfill the deficit in DM abundance. On the other hand, the strong gauge mediated direct detection constraint can be evaded with the help of a $SU(2)_L$ triplet scalar(with $Y=2$), resulting a pseudo-Dirac DM. To realize our proposed scenario we impose a discrete $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry under which both $\Psi$ and $S$ are odd while rest of the fields are even. We find the lepton doublet pseudo-Dirac DM with mass $\sim 550-1200$ GeV, compatible with the observed relic density, direct, indirect, and existing collider search constraints.</p>

<p>2023-06-22, <strong>Searching for dark matter substructure: a deeper wide-area community survey for Roman</strong>, Tansu Daylan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12864v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12864v1</a></p>

<p>We recommend a deeper extension to the High-Latitute Wide Area Survey planned to be conducted by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (\emph{Roman}). While this deeper-tier survey extension can support a range of astrophysical investigations, it is particularly well suited to characterize the dark matter substructure in galactic halos and reveal the microphysics of dark matter through gravitational lensing. We quantify the expected yield of \emph{Roman} for finding galaxy-galaxy-type gravitational lenses and motivate observational choices to optimize the \emph{Roman} core community surveys for studying dark matter substructure. In the proposed survey, we expect to find, on average, one strong lens with a characterizable substructure per \emph{Roman} tile (0.28 squared degrees), yielding approximately 500 such high-quality lenses. With such a deeper legacy survey, \emph{Roman} will outperform any current and planned telescope within the next decade in its potential to characterize the concentration and abundance of dark matter subhalos in the mass range 10$^7$-10$^{11}$\,M$_{\odot}$.</p>

<p>2023-06-22, <strong>Extragalactic Star Cluster Science with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope’s High Latitude Wide Area Survey and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</strong>, Kristen C. Dage et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12620v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12620v1</a></p>

<p>The Nancy Grace Roman Telescope’s High Latitude Wide Area Survey will have a number of synergies with the Vera Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), particularly for extragalactic star clusters. Understanding the nature of star clusters and star cluster systems are key topics in many areas of astronomy, chief among them stellar evolution, high energy astrophysics, galaxy assembly/dark matter, the extragalactic distance scale, and cosmology. One of the challenges will be disentangling the age/metallicity degeneracy because young ($\sim$Myr) metal-rich clusters have similar SEDs to old ($\sim$Gyr) metal-poor clusters. Rubin will provide homogeneous, $ugrizy$ photometric coverage, and measurements in the red Roman filters will help break the age-metallicity and age-extinction degeneracies, providing the first globular cluster samples that cover wide areas while essentially free of contamination from Milky Way stars. Roman’s excellent spatial resolution will also allow measurements of cluster sizes. We advocate for observations of a large sample of galaxies with a range of properties and morphologies in the Rubin/LSST footprint matching the depth of the LSST Wide-Fast-Deep field $i$ band limit (26.3 mag), and recommend adding the F213 filter to the survey.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>A Generic Formation Mechanism of Ultralight Dark Matter Solar Halos</strong>, Dmitry Budker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12477v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12477v1</a></p>

<p>As-yet undiscovered light bosons may constitute all or part of the dark matter (DM) of our Universe, and are expected to have (weak) self-interactions. We show that the quartic self-interactions generically induce the capture of dark matter from the surrounding halo by external gravitational potentials such as those of stars, including the Sun. This leads to the subsequent formation of dark matter bound states supported by such external potentials, resembling gravitational atoms (e.g. a solar halo around our own Sun). Their growth is governed by the ratio $\xi_{\rm foc} \equiv \lambda_{\rm dB}/R_\star$ between the de Broglie wavelength of the incoming DM waves, $\lambda_{\rm dB}$, and the radius of the ground state $R_\star$. For $\xi_{\rm foc}\lesssim 1$, the gravitational atom grows to an (underdense) steady state that balances the capture of particles and the inverse (stripping) process. For $\xi_{\rm foc}\gtrsim 1$, a significant gravitational-focusing effect leads to exponential accumulation of mass from the galactic DM halo into the gravitational atom. For instance, a dark matter axion with mass of the order of $10^{-14}$ eV and decay constant between $10^{7}$ and $10^8$ GeV would form a dense halo around the Sun on a timescale comparable to the lifetime of the Solar System, leading to a local DM density at the position of the Earth $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ times larger than that expected in the standard halo model. For attractive self-interactions, after its formation, the gravitational atom is destabilized at a large density, which leads to its collapse; this is likely to be accompanied by emission of relativistic bosons (a `Bosenova’).</p>

<p>Models which address both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions with the same mechanism generically cause a pre-recombination suppression of the small scale matter power spectrum. Here we focus on two such models. Both models introduce a self-interacting dark radiation fluid scattering with dark matter, which has a step in its abundance around some transition redshift. In one model, the interaction is weak and with all of the dark matter whereas in the other it is strong but with only a fraction of the dark matter. The weakly interacting case is able to address both tensions simultaneously and provide a good fit to a the Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae, and a combination of low and high redshift baryon acoustic oscillation data, whereas the strongly interacting model cannot significantly ease both tensions simultaneously. The addition of high-resolution cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements (ACT DR4 and SPT-3G) slightly limits both model’s ability to address the Hubble tension. The use of the effective field theory of large-scale structures analysis of BOSS DR12 LRG and eBOSS DR16 QSO data additionally limits their ability to address the $S_8$ tension. We explore how these models respond to these data sets in detail in order to draw general conclusions about what is required for a mechanism to address both tensions. We find that in order to fit the CMB data the time dependence of the suppression of the matter power spectrum plays a central role.</p>

<p>How many low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and free-floating planets are in the Milky Way? And how are they distributed in our Galaxy? Recent studies of Milky Way interlopers in high-redshift observations have revealed a 150-300 pc thick disk of these cool stars with 7% of the M-dwarfs in an oblate stellar halo. One can use the High Latitude Survey with the Roman Space Telescope to search for Galactic ultracool dwarfs (spectral classes M, L, T, and Y) to accurately model the 3D structure and the temperature and chemical evolution of the Milky Way disk in these low-mass (sub)stellar objects.   Accurate typing has been shown to work on HST grism and photometric data using machine learning techniques. Such an approach can also be applied to Roman photometry, producing accurate photometric typing to within two subtypes. The High Latitude Survey provides enough statistical power to model the Milky Way structural components (thin and thick disks and halo) for M-, L- and T/Y-dwarfs. This approach has the benefit to allow us to constrain scale-lengths, scale-heights and densities, as well as the relative position of our Sun with respect to the disk of dwarf stars of our Milky Way. The total number of each brown dwarf type can be used to infer both the low-mass end of the Galaxy-wide Initial Mass Function (IMF) for the first time, the formation history of low-mass stellar and substellar objects, and the fraction of low-mass stars in the halo, a statistic that can test cold dark matter structure formation theories.</p>

<p>Galaxies co-evolve with their host dark matter halos. Models of the galaxy-halo connection, calibrated using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, can be used to populate dark matter halo catalogs with galaxies. We present a new method for inferring baryonic properties from dark matter subhalo properties using message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs). After training on subhalo catalog data from the Illustris TNG300-1 hydrodynamic simulation, our GNN can infer stellar mass from the host and neighboring subhalo positions, kinematics, masses, and maximum circular velocities. We find that GNNs can also robustly estimate stellar mass from subhalo properties in 2d projection. While other methods typically model the galaxy-halo connection in isolation, our GNN incorporates information from galaxy environments, leading to more accurate stellar mass inference.</p>

<p>Once further confirmed in future analyses, the radius and mass measurement of HESS J1731-347 with $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~M_{\odot}$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}~\rm km$ will be among the lightest and smallest compact object ever detected. This raises many questions about its nature and opens up the window for different theories to explain such a measurement. In this article, we use the information from Doroshenko et al. (2022) on the mass, radius, and surface temperature together with the multi-messenger observations of neutron stars to investigate the possibility that HESS J1731-347 is one of the lightest observed neutron star (NS), a strange star (SS), a hybrid star (HS) with an early deconfinement phase transition, or a dark matter (DM) admixed neutron star. The nucleonic and quark matter are modeled within realistic equation of states (EoSs) with a self-consistent calculation of the pairing gaps in quark matter. By performing the joint analysis of the thermal evolution and mass-radius constraint, we find evidence that within a 1$\sigma$ confidence level, HESS J1731-347 is consistent with the neutron star scenario with the soft EoS as well as with a strange and hybrid star with the early deconfinement phase transition with a strong quark pairing and neutron star admixed with dark matter.</p>

<p>As our nearest large neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy provides a unique laboratory for investigating galaxy formation and the distribution and substructure properties of dark matter in a Milky Way-like galaxy. Here, we propose an initial 2-epoch ($\Delta t\approx 5$yr), 2-band Roman survey of the entire halo of Andromeda, covering 500 square degrees, which will detect nearly every red giant star in the halo (10$\sigma$ detection in F146, F062 of 26.5, 26.1AB mag respectively) and yield proper motions to $\sim$25 microarcsec/year (i.e., $\sim$90 km/s) for all stars brighter than F146 $\approx 23.6$ AB mag (i.e., reaching the red clump stars in the Andromeda halo). This survey will yield (through averaging) high-fidelity proper motions for all satellites and compact substructures in the Andromeda halo and will enable statistical searches for clusters in chemo-dynamical space. Adding a third epoch during the extended mission will improve these proper motions by $\sim t^{-1.5}$, to $\approx 11$ km/s, but this requires obtaining the first epoch in Year 1 of Roman operations. In combination with ongoing and imminent spectroscopic campaigns with ground-based telescopes, this Roman survey has the potential to yield full 3-d space motions of $&gt;$100,000 stars in the Andromeda halo, including (by combining individual measurements) robust space motions of its entire globular cluster and most of its dwarf galaxy satellite populations. It will also identify high-velocity stars in Andromeda, providing unique information on the processes that create this population. These data offer a unique opportunity to study the immigration history, halo formation, and underlying dark matter scaffolding of a galaxy other than our own.</p>

<p>The first series of observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered unexpectedly abundant luminous galaxies at high redshift, posing possibly a serious challenge to popular galaxy formation models. We study early structure formation in a cosmological model with a blue, tilted power spectrum (BTPS) given by $P(k) \propto k^{m_{\rm s}}$ with $m_{\rm s} &gt; 1$ at small length scales. We run a set of cosmological $N$-body simulations and derive the abundance of dark matter halos and of galaxies under simplified assumptions on star formation efficiency. The enhanced small-scale power allows rapid formation of nonlinear structure at $z&gt;7$, and galaxies with stellar mass exceeding $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ can be formed by $z=9$. Because of frequent mergers, the structure of galaxies and galaxy groups appears overall clumpy. The BTPS model reproduces the observed stellar mass density at $z=7-9$, and thus eases the claimed tension between galaxy formation theory and recent JWST observations. Large-scale structure of the present-day Universe is largely unaffected by the modification of the small-scale power spectrum. Finally, we discuss the formation of the first stars and early super-massive black holes in the BTPS model.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>Formation of first star clusters under the supersonic gas flow – I. Morphology of the massive metal-free gas cloud</strong>, Shingo Hirano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11992v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.11992v1</a></p>

<p>We performed $42$ simulations of the first star formation with initial supersonic gas flows relative to the dark matter at the cosmic recombination era. Increasing the initial streaming velocities led to delayed halo formation and increased halo mass, enhancing the mass of the gravitationally shrinking gas cloud. For more massive gas clouds, the rate of temperature drop during contraction, in other words, the structure asymmetry, becomes more significant. When the maximum and minimum gas temperature ratios before and after contraction exceed about ten, the asymmetric structure of the gas cloud prevails, inducing fragmentation into multiple dense gas clouds. We continued our simulations until $10^5$ years after the first dense core formation to examine the final fate of the massive star-forming gas cloud. Among the $42$ models studied, we find the simultaneous formation of up to four dense gas clouds, with a total mass of about $2254\,M_\odot$. While the gas mass in the host halo increases with increasing the initial streaming velocity, the mass of the dense cores does not change significantly. The star formation efficiency decreases by more than one order of magnitude from $\epsilon_{\rm III} \sim 10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$ when the initial streaming velocity, normalised by the root mean square value, increases from 0 to 3.</p>

<p>The core-collapse supernova of a massive star rapidly brightens when a shock, produced following the collapse of its core, reaches the stellar surface. As the shock-heated star subsequently expands and cools, its early-time light curve should have a simple dependence on the progenitor’s size and therefore final evolutionary state. Measurements of the progenitor’s radius from early light curves exist for only a small sample of nearby supernovae, and almost all lack constraining ultraviolet observations within a day of explosion. The several-day time delays and magnifying ability of galaxy-scale gravitational lenses, however, should provide a powerful tool for measuring the early light curves of distant supernovae, and thereby studying massive stellar populations at high redshift. Here we analyse individual rest-frame ultraviolet-through-optical exposures taken with the Hubble Space Telescope that simultaneously capture, in three separate gravitationally lensed images, the early phases of a supernova at redshift $z \approx 3$ beginning within $5.8\pm 3.1$ hr of explosion. The supernova, seen at a lookback time of $\sim11.5$ billion years, is strongly lensed by an early-type galaxy in the Abell 370 cluster. We constrain the pre-explosion radius to be $533^{+154}_{-119}$ solar radii, consistent with a red supergiant. Highly confined and massive circumstellar material at the same radius can also reproduce the light curve, but is unlikely since no similar low-redshift examples are known.</p>

<p>Type Ia supernova explosions (SNIa) are fundamental sources of elements for the chemical evolution of galaxies. They efficiently produce intermediate-mass (with Z between 11 and 20) and iron group elements - for example, about 70% of the solar iron is expected to be made by SNIa. In this work, we calculate complete abundance yields for 39 models of SNIa explosions, based on three progenitors - a 1.4M deflagration detonation model, a 1.0 double detonation model and a 0.8 M double detonation model - and 13 metallicities, with 22Ne mass fractions of 0, 1x10-7, 1x10-6, 1x10-5, 1x10-4, 1x10-3, 2x10-3, 5x10-3, 1x10-2, 1.4x10-2, 5x10-2, and 0.1 respectively. Nucleosynthesis calculations are done using the NuGrid suite of codes, using a consistent nuclear reaction network between the models. Complete tables with yields and production factors are provided online at Zenodo: Yields. We discuss the main properties of our yields in the light of the present understanding of SNIa nucleosynthesis, depending on different progenitor mass and composition. Finally, we compare our results with a number of relevant models from the literature.</p>

<p>2023-06-22, <strong>No plateau observed in late-time near-infrared observations of the underluminous Type Ia supernova 2021qvv</strong>, O. Graur et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12858v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12858v1</a></p>

<p>Near-infrared (NIR) observations of normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained between 150 to 500 d past maximum light reveal the existence of an extended plateau. Here, we present observations of the underluminous, 1991bg-like SN 2021qvv. Early, ground-based optical and NIR observations show that SN 2021qvv is similar to SN 2006mr, making it one of the dimmest, fastest-evolving 1991bg-like SNe to date. Late-time (170-250 d) Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN 2021qvv reveal no sign of a plateau. An extrapolation of these observations backwards to earlier-phase NIR observations of SN 2006mr suggests the complete absence of a NIR plateau, at least out to 250 d. This absence may be due to the lower temperatures of the ejecta of 1991bg-like SNe, relative to normal SNe Ia, which might preclude their becoming fluorescent and shifting ultraviolet light into the NIR. This suggestion can be tested by acquiring NIR imaging of a sample of 1991bg-like SNe that covers the entire range from slowly-evolving to fast-evolving events ($0.2 \lesssim s_\mathrm{BV} \lesssim 0.6$). A detection of the NIR plateau in slower-evolving, hotter 1991bg-like SNe would provide further evidence that these SNe exist along a continuum with normal SNe Ia. Theoretical progenitor and explosion scenarios would then have to match the observed properties of both SN Ia subtypes.</p>

<p>As one of the most energetic and brightest events, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be treated as a promising probe of the high-redshift universe. Similar to type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), GRBs with same physical origin could be treated as standard candles. We select GRB samples with the same physical origin, which are divided into two groups. One group is consisted of 31 GRBs with a plateau phase feature of a constant luminosity followed by a decay index of about -2 in the X-ray afterglow light curves, and the other has 50 GRBs with a shallow decay phase in the optical light curves. For the selected GRB samples, we confirm that there is a tight correlation between the plateau luminosity $L_0$, the end time of plateau $t_b$ and the isotropic energy release $E_{\gamma,iso}$. We also find that the $L_0-t_b-E_{\gamma,iso}$ correlation is insensitive to the cosmological parameters and no valid limitations on the cosmological parameters can be obtained using this correlation. We explore a new three-parameter correlation $L_0$, $t_b$, and the spectral peak energy in the rest frame $E_{p,i}$ ($L_0-t_b-E_{p,i}$), and find that this correlation can be used as a standard candle to constrain the cosmological parameters. By employing the optical sample only, we find the constraints of $\Omega_m = 0.697_{-0.278}^{+0.402}(1\sigma)$ for a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. For the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model, the best-fitting results are $\Omega_m = 0.713_{-0.278}^{+0.346}$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.981_{-0.580}^{+0.379}(1\sigma)$. For the combination of the X-ray and optical smaples, we find $\Omega_m = 0.313_{-0.125}^{+0.179}(1\sigma)$ for a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $\Omega_m = 0.344_{-0.112}^{+0.176}$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.770_{-0.416}^{+0.366}(1\sigma)$ for a non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model.</p>

<p>Cool a piece of the Sun to 1000 K at one millibar pressure to yield a mineral assemblage consistent with those found in the most primitive meteorites. This is an equilibrium or fractional condensation experiment simulated by calculations using equations of state for hundreds of gaseous molecules, condensed mineral solids, and silicate liquids, the products of a century of experimental measurements and theoretical studies. Such calculations have revolutionized our understanding of the chemistry of the cosmos.   The mid-20th Century realization that meteorites are fossil records of the early Solar System made chemistry central to understanding planetary origins. Thus “condensation”, the distribution of elements and isotopes between vapor and condensed solids and/or liquids at or approaching chemical equilibrium, deeply informs discussion of how meteor/comet compositions bear on planets.   Condensation calculations have been applied to disks around young stars, to the mineral “rain” of mineral grains expected to form in cool dwarf star atmospheres, to the expanding envelopes of giant stars, to the vapor plumes that form in planetary impacts, and to the chemically and isotopically distinct “shells” computed and observed to exist in supernovae. As with all sophisticated calculations, there are inherent caveats, subtleties, and computational difficulties.   Local chemistry has yet to be consistently integrated into dynamical astrophysical simulations so that effects like the blocking of radiation by grains, absorption and reemission of light by grains, and buffering of heat by grain evaporation/condensation feed back into the physics at each node of a gridded calculation over time. A deeper integration of thermochemistry with physical models makes the prospect of a general protoplanetary disk model as hopeful now as a general circulation model for global climate was in the early 1970’s.</p>

<p>Modified theories of gravity encompass a class of $f(R)$-models that seek to elucidate the observed late time accelerated expansion of the universe. In this study, we examine a set of viable $f(R)$ models (Hu-Sawicki: two cases, Satrobinsky, Tsujikawa, exponential and arcTanh models) in metric formalism, using recent cosmological data sets: type Ia supernovae data, cosmic chronometer observations, baryonic acoustic oscillations data, data from H\textsc{ii} starburst galaxies, and local measurements of the Hubble parameter $H_0$. The model parameters are constrained using a Bayesian analysis with the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method. We employ statistical tools such as the Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, and reduced chi-square statistics to conduct a comparative investigation of these models. We determine the transition redshift, the evolution of total equation-of-state (EoS) parameter, and the EoS for the component responsible for current accelerated expansion to characterize the expansion’s evolution. Taking into account the ``Hubble tension,” we perform the study with and without a Gaussian prior for $H_0$ from local measurements. Our findings are as follows: (i) in many cases the $f(R)$ models are strongly favored over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, (ii) the deviation parameter ($b$) significantly deviates from zero in several cases, (iii) the inclusion of local $H_0$ not only increases the fitted value of $H_0$ (as expected) but also affects the gap between predictions of $f(R)$ models and the $\Lambda$CDM model, and (iv) the relevant quantities characterizing the (accelerated) expansion of the universe obtained in our models are consistent with those obtained in a model-independent way by others. Our investigation and results present a compelling case for pursuing further research on $f(R)$ models with future observations to come.</p>

<p>Although there are estimated to be 100 million isolated black holes (BHs) in the Milky Way, only one has been found so far, resulting in significant uncertainty about their properties. The Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey provides the only opportunity in the coming decades to grow this catalog by order(s) of magnitude. This can be achieved if 1) Roman’s astrometric potential is fully realized in the observation strategy and software pipelines, 2) Roman’s observational gaps of the Bulge are minimized, and 3) observations with ground-based facilities are taken of the Bulge to fill in gaps during non-Bulge seasons. A large sample of isolated BHs will enable a broad range of astrophysical questions to be answered, such as massive stellar evolution, origin of gravitational wave sources, supernova physics, and the growth of supermassive BHs, maximizing Roman’s scientific return.</p>

<p>While gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens from neutron star (NS) mergers have been proposed to offer good measurements of the Hubble constant, we show in this paper how a variation of the expanding photosphere method (EPM) or spectral-fitting expanding atmosphere method, applied to the kilonovae (KNe) associated with the mergers, can provide an independent and potentially percent-accurate distance measurement to individual mergers. The KN-EPM overcomes the major uncertainties commonly associated with this method in supernovae for four reasons: 1) the early continuum is very well-reproduced by a blackbody spectrum, 2) the dilution effect from electron scattering opacity is likely negligible, 3) the explosion times are exactly known due to the GW detection, and 4) the ejecta geometry is, at least in some cases, highly spherical and can be constrained from line-shape analysis. We provide an analysis of the early VLT/X-shooter spectra AT2017gfo showing how the luminosity distance can be determined, and find a luminosity distance of $D_L = 44.5\pm0.5\,$Mpc in agreement with, but more precise than, previous methods. We investigate the dominant systematic uncertainties, but our simple framework, which assumes a blackbody photosphere, does not account for the full time-dependent, three-dimensional radiative transfer effects, so this distance should be treated as preliminary. The luminosity distance corresponds to an estimated Hubble constant of $H_0 = 67.1\pm 3.4\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}\,$Mpc$^{-1}$, where the dominant uncertainty is due to the modelling of the host peculiar velocity. We also estimate the expected constraints on $H_0$ from future KN-EPM-analysis with the upcoming O4 and O5 runs of the LIGO collaboration GW-detectors, where 5-10 similar KNe would yield 1% precision cosmological constraints.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>Exploring the Evolution of Massive Clumps in Simulations that Reproduce the Observed Milky Way α-element Abundance Bimodality</strong>, Bethany R. Garver et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12388v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12388v1</a></p>

<p>The Milky Way stellar disk has both a thin and a thick component. The thin disk is composed mostly of younger stars ($\lesssim$8 Gyr) with a lower abundance of $\alpha$ elements, while the thick disk contains predominantly older stars ($\gtrsim$8–12 Gyr) with a higher $\alpha$ abundance, giving rise to an $\alpha$-bimodality most prominent at intermediate metallicities. A proposed explanation for the bimodality is an episode of clumpy star formation, where high-$\alpha$ stars form in massive clumps that appear in the first few Gyrs of the Milky Way’s evolution, while low-$\alpha$ stars form throughout the disk and over a longer time span. To better understand the evolution of clumps, we track them and their constituent stars in two clumpy Milky Way simulations that reproduce the $\alpha$-abundance bimodality, one with 10% and the other with 20% supernova feedback efficiency. We investigate the paths that these clumps take in the chemical space ([O/Fe]–[Fe/H]) as well as their mass, star formation rate (SFR), formation location, lifetime, and merger history. The clumps in the simulation with lower feedback last longer on average, with several lasting hundreds of Myr. Some of the clumps do not reach high-$\alpha$, but the ones that do on average had a higher SFR, longer lifetime, greater mass, and form closer to the galactic center than the ones that do not. Most clumps that reach high-$\alpha$ merge with others and eventually spiral into the galactic center, but shed stars along the way to form most of the thick disk component.</p>

<p>Supernova (SN) H0pe was discovered as a new transient in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam images of the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 taken as part of the “Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science” (PEARLS) JWST GTO program (# 1176) on 2023 March 30 (AstroNote 2023-96; Frye et al. 2023). The transient is a compact source associated with a background galaxy that is stretched and triply-imaged by the cluster’s strong gravitational lensing. This paper reports spectra in the 950-1370 nm observer frame of two of the galaxy’s images obtained with Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) Utility Camera in the Infrared (LUCI) in longslit mode two weeks after the \JWST\ observations. The individual average spectra show the [OII] doublet and the Balmer and 4000 Angstrom breaks at redshift z=1.783+/-0.002. The CIGALE best-fit model of the spectral energy distribution indicates that SN H0pe’s host galaxy is massive (Mstar~6x10^10 Msun after correcting for a magnification factor ~7) with a predominant intermediate age (~2 Gyr) stellar population, moderate extinction, and a magnification-corrected star formation rate ~13 Msun/yr, consistent with being below the main sequence of star formation. These properties suggest that H0pe might be a type Ia SN. Additional observations of SN H0pe and its host recently carried out with JWST (JWST-DD-4446; PI: B. Frye) will be able to both determine the SN classification and confirm its association with the galaxy analyzed in this work.</p>

<p>The Tayler-Spruit dynamo is one of the most promising mechanisms proposed to explain angular momentum transport during stellar evolution. Its development in proto-neutron stars spun-up by supernova fallback has also been put forward as a scenario to explain the formation of very magnetized neutron stars called magnetars. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we model the proto-neutron star interior as a stably stratified spherical Couette flow with the outer sphere that rotates faster than the inner one. We report the existence of two subcritical dynamo branches driven by the Tayler instability. They differ by their equatorial symmetry (dipolar or hemispherical) and the magnetic field scaling, which is in agreement with different theoretical predictions (by Fuller and Spruit, respectively). The magnetic dipole of the dipolar branch is found to reach intensities compatible with observational constraints on magnetars.</p>

<p>Very-high-energy (VHE) observations have revealed approximately 100 TeV sources in our Galaxy, and a significant fraction of them are under investigation for understanding their origin. We report our study of one of them, HESS~J1844$-$030. It is found possibly associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G29.37+0.1, and detailed studies of the source region at radio and X-ray frequencies have suggested that this SNR is a composite one, containing a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by a candidate young pulsar. As the GeV source 4FGL~J1844.4$-$0306 is also located in the region with high positional coincidence, we analyze its $\gamma$-ray data obtained with the Large Area Telescope on-board the {\it Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope }. We determine the GeV $\gamma$-ray emission is extended, described with a Log-Parabola function. The obtained spectrum can be connected to that of the VHE source HESS J1844$-$030. Given the properties and those from multi-frequency studies, we discuss the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission by considering that the two \gr\ sources are associated. Our modeling indicates that while the TeV part would have either a hadronic (from the SNR) or a leptonic origin (from the putative PWN), the GeV part would arise from a hadronic process. Thus we conclude that 4FGL~J1844.4$-$0306 is the likely GeV counterpart to G29.37+0.1.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>Modeling of the nebular-phase spectral evolution of stripped-envelope supernovae. New grids from 100 to 450 days</strong>, Luc Dessart et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12092v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.12092v1</a></p>

<p>We present an extended grid of multi-epoch 1D nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations for nebular-phase Type Ibc supernovae (SNe) from He-star explosions. Compared to Dessart+21, we study the spectral evolution from 100 to about 450d and augment the model set with progenitors that were evolved without wind mass loss. Models with the same final, preSN mass have similar yields and produce essentially the same emergent spectra. Hence, the uncertain progenitor mass loss history compromises the inference of the initial, main sequence mass. This shortcoming does not affect Type IIb SNe. However, our 1D models with a different preSN mass tend to yield widely different spectra, as seen through variations in the strong emission lines due to [NII]6548-6583, [OI]6300-6364, [CaII]7291-7323, [NiII]7378, and the forest of FeII lines below 5500A. At the lower mass end, the ejecta are He rich and at 100d cool through HeI, NII, CaII, and FeII lines, with NII and FeII dominating at 450d. These models, associated with He giants, conflict with observed SNe Ib, which typically lack strong NII emission. Instead they may lead to SNe Ibn or, because of additional stripping by a companion star, ultra-stripped SNe Ic. In contrast, for higher preSN masses, the ejecta are progressively He poor and cool at 100d through OI, CaII, and FeII lines, with OI and CaII dominating at 450d. Nonuniform, aspherical, large-scale mixing rather than composition differences likely determines the SN type at intermediate preSN masses. Variations in clumping, mixing, as well as departures from spherical symmetry would increase the spectral diversity but also introduce additional degeneracies. More robust predictions from spectral modeling require a careful attention to the initial conditions informed by physically-consistent 3D explosion models [abridged].</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>A metallicity dependence on the occurrence of core-collapse supernovae</strong>, Thallis Pessi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11962v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.11962v1</a></p>

<p>Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are widely accepted to be caused by the explosive death of massive stars with initial masses $\gtrsim 8$M$_\odot$. There is, however, a comparatively poor understanding of how properties of the progenitors – mass, metallicity, multiplicity, rotation etc. – manifest in the resultant CCSN population. Here we present a minimally biased sample of nearby CCSNe from the ASAS-SN survey whose host galaxies were observed with integral-field spectroscopy using MUSE at the VLT. This dataset allows us to analyze the explosion sites of CCSNe within the context of global star formation properties across the host galaxies. We show that the CCSN explosion site oxygen abundance distribution is offset to lower values than the overall HII region abundance distribution within the host galaxies. We further show that within the subsample of low-metallicity host galaxies, the CCSNe unbiasedly trace the star-formation with respect to oxygen abundance, while for the sub-sample of higher-metallicity host galaxies, they preferentially occur in lower-abundance star-forming regions. We estimate the occurrence of CCSNe as a function of oxygen abundance per unit star formation, and show that there is a strong decrease as abundance increases. Such a strong and quantified metallicity dependence on CCSN production has not been shown before. Finally, we discuss possible explanations for our result and show that each of these has strong implications for our understanding of CCSNe and massive star evolution.</p>

<p>2023-06-21, <strong>A characterization of ASAS-SN core-collapse supernova environments with VLT+MUSE: I. Sample selection, analysis of local environments, and correlations with light curve properties</strong>, Thallis Pessi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11961v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.11961v1</a></p>

<p>The analysis of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) environments can provide important information on the life cycle of massive stars and constrain the progenitor properties of these powerful explosions. The MUSE instrument at the VLT enables detailed local environment constraints of the progenitors of large samples of CCSNe. Using a homogeneous SN sample from the ASAS-SN survey has enabled us to perform a minimally biased statistical analysis of CCSN environments. We analyze 111 galaxies observed by MUSE that hosted 112 CCSNe detected or discovered by the ASAS-SN survey between 2014 and 2018. The majority of the galaxies were observed by the the AMUSING survey. Here we analyze the immediate environment around the SN locations and compare the properties between the different CCSN types and their light curves. We used stellar population synthesis and spectral fitting techniques to derive physical parameters for all HII regions detected within each galaxy, including the star formation rate (SFR), H$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW), oxygen abundance, and extinction. We found that stripped-envelope (SE) SNe occur in environments with a higher median SFR, H$\alpha$ EW, and oxygen abundances than SNe II and SNe IIn/Ibn. The distributions of SNe II and IIn are very similar, indicating that these events explode in similar environments. For the SESNe, SNe Ic have higher median SFRs, H$\alpha$ EWs, and oxygen abundances than SNe Ib. SNe IIb have environments with similar SFRs and H$\alpha$ EWs to SNe Ib, and similar oxygen abundances to SNe Ic. We also show that the postmaximum decline rate, $s$, of SNe II correlates with the H$\alpha$ EW, and that the luminosity and the $\Delta m_{15}$ parameter of SESNe correlate with the oxygen abundance, H$\alpha$ EW, and SFR at their environments. This suggests a connection between the explosion mechanisms of these events to their environment properties.</p>
