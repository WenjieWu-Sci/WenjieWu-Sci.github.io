<p>2026-01-13, <strong>Enhanced Athermal Phonon Responsivity in a Kinetic Inductance Detector with Integrated Phonon Collectors</strong>, Leonardo Pesce et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08532v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.08532v1</a></p>

<p>Cryogenic phonon detectors are adopted in light dark matter searches and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments as they can achieve low energy thresholds. The phonon mediated sensing of silicon particle absorbers has already been proved with Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), acting both as sensors and athermal phonon absorbers at the same time. In this work we present the design and the performance of an improved detector, where the KID acts only as sensor and is coupled to dedicated phonon collectors. The separation between the detector and the collectors increases the variation of the quasi-particle density within the device, thereby enhancing its responsivity. The meander of the KID is composed of a 77nm trilayer wire of Aluminum-Titanium-Aluminum, while the phonon collectors are made of a 100nm Aluminum layer and act as quasi-particles funnels. Inside the collectors, the absorbed athermal phonons generate quasi-particles which, after diffusion, are trapped in the lower-gap superconducting trilayer. The performance of this setup is compared to that of a standard phonon-mediated KID, showing an increase in responsivity by around a factor of five.</p>

<p>2026-01-13, <strong>Bifurcated Impact of Neutrino Fast Flavor Conversion on Core-collapse Supernovae Informed by Multi-angle Neutrino Radiation Hydrodynamics</strong>, Ryuichiro Akaho et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08269v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.08269v1</a></p>

<p>In this {\it Letter}, we present a compelling and robust argument for the roles of neutrino fast flavor conversion (FFC) in the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), combining the {\it multi-angle} FFC subgrid model rooted in quantum kinetic theory with the multi-dimensional four-species Boltzmann neutrino radiation hydrodynamics. Employing various progenitor masses and the nuclear equations of states, we find that the effect of FFC on CCSN explosion is bifurcated depending on the progenitors. For the lowest-mass progenitor, FFC facilitates the shock revival and enhances the explosion energy, whereas for higher-mass progenitors its impact is inhibitory. We identify the mass accretion rate as the key determinant governing this bifurcation. When the mass accretion rate is low (high), the contribution of FFC to neutrino heating becomes positive (negative), because the heating efficiency enhancement via FFC-driven spectral hardening of electron-type neutrinos dominates over (is outweighed by) the concurrent reduction in neutrino luminosity. Our results further highlight the limitations of approximate neutrino transport, and demonstrate that a multi-angle treatment is essential for accurately capturing FFC effects; otherwise, FFCs are missed and even generated spuriously.</p>

<p>2026-01-13, <strong>Energy and momentum dependence of the soft-axion interaction rate</strong>, Killian Bouzoud et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08221v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.08221v1</a></p>

<p>Axions coupled to thermal non-Abelian gauge fields may have cosmological significance. As the heat bath defines a frame, its influence depends separately on energy and momentum. A light-like momentum ($k \approx ω$) is relevant for the axion contribution to the effective number of light neutrinos, $ΔN^{ }_\mathrm{eff}$, whereas a vanishing momentum ($k=0$) plays a role for warm natural inflation or ultralight dark matter, and has been employed in lattice estimates (both classical and quantum-statistical) of the strong sphaleron rate. Focussing on soft energies ($α_\mathrm{s}^{ }T \ll ω\ll πT$), we carry out an HTL computation to show how the domains $k=0$ and $k \approx ω$ interpolate to each other. We then compare with lattice data at $k=0$, and connect our analysis to NLO computations at $k \approx ω\ge πT$. Assembling the current best input, we re-investigate light QCD axion decoupling dynamics at $T \ge 200$ MeV, showing that efficient interactions in the ultrasoft domain increase $ΔN^{ }_\mathrm{eff}$ from $\sim 0.03$ to $\sim 0.04$ at $f^{ }_a = 4\times 10^8_{ }$ GeV.</p>

<p>2026-01-13, <strong>Lepton Magnetic Moments: What They Tell Us</strong>, Fred Jegerlehner et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08101v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.08101v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, the exciting new Fermilab (FNAL) Muon g-2 measurement impressively confirmed the final Brookhaven (BNL) result from 2004, and with a result four times more precise, has launched a new serious attack on the Standard Model (SM). On the theoretical side, ab initio lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations of hadronic vacuum polarization have made remarkable progress. They are now the new standard for studying the leading non-perturbative contributions, which have previously hindered matching with the precision required for full exploitation of the experimental results. The lattice results affected both leading hadronic contributions the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contributions by increasing the previously generally accepted $e^+e^-$ to hadrons based dispersion relation results. The shifts reduced the discrepancy between theory and experiment, leaving nothing missing. One of the most prominent signs of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics has disappeared: the SM appears validated more than ever, in agreement with what other searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN tell us! A triumph of the SM, even though the SM cannot explain known cosmological puzzles like dark matter or baryogenesis, and why neutrino masses are so tiny, the absence of strong CP violation, for example. I also argue that the discrepancy between the data-driven dispersive result and the lattice QCD results for the hadronic vacuum polarization can be largely explained by correcting the $e^+e^-$ data for ‘rho-gamma’ mixing effects.</p>

<p>2026-01-12, <strong>Relativistic jets from millisecond proto-magnetars</strong>, Dhruv K. Desai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07918v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.07918v1</a></p>

<p>Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars’’) formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.</p>

<p>2026-01-12, <strong>Performance Benchmarks for 2-View and 3-View Fiber-Projection Fine-Grained Particle Detectors</strong>, Haohui Che et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07633v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.07633v1</a></p>

<p>Fine-grained scintillator detectors are critical for precision measurements in nuclear and particle physics, where accurate reconstruction of interaction vertices and secondary particle directions enables separation of signal from background events. A well-known design choice is the fiber readout geometry: traditional 2-View systems use orthogonal X and Y fibers, while next-generation 3-View designs add a third Z-fiber layer that provides unambiguous 3D voxel identification. The 2-View approach suffers from combinatorial ghost hits, that the false 3D candidates arising from fiber projection ambiguities, degrading reconstruction performance in high-multiplicity events. This paper presents comprehensive simulation benchmarks quantifying the performance difference between 2-View and 3-View geometries across key metrics. We find that the 3-View geometry reduces ghost hits by 30–90\% depending on event topology, provides robust vertex resolution across complex topologies, and maintains superior angular resolution for shower direction reconstruction. These benchmarks inform the design optimization of future detectors and provide quantitative guidance for reconstruction algorithm development across a broad range of experiments including neutrino physics, rare kaon/pion decays, and collider calorimetry.</p>

<p>2026-01-12, <strong>Deep Search for Joint Sources of Gravitational Waves and High-Energy Neutrinos with IceCube During the Third Observing Run of LIGO and Virgo</strong>, The IceCube Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07595v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.07595v1</a></p>

<p>The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, from the dynamics of compact object mergers and stellar collapses to the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources. Our results constrain the isotropic neutrino emission from gravitational-wave sources for very high values of the total energy emitted in neutrinos (&gt; $10^{52} - 10^{54}$ erg).</p>

<p>2026-01-12, <strong>Cosmic rays, gamma rays and neutrinos from discrete black hole X-ray binary ejecta</strong>, Nicolas J. Bacon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07589v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.07589v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of cosmic rays from outside the Solar system are unknown, as they are deflected by the interstellar magnetic field. Supernova remnants are the main candidate for cosmic rays up to PeV energies but due to lack of evidence, they cannot be concluded as the sources of the most energetic Galactic CRs. We investigate discrete ejecta produced in state transitions of black hole X-ray binary systems as a potential source of cosmic rays, motivated by recent $&gt;100$ TeV $γ$-ray detections by LHAASO. Starting from MAXI J1820+070, we examine the multi-wavelength observations and find that efficient particle acceleration may take place (i.e. into a robust power-law), up to $\sim2\times 10^{16}μ^{-1/2}$ eV, where $μ$ is the ratio of particle energy to magnetic energy. From these calculations, we estimate the global contribution of ejecta to the entire Galactic spectrum to be $\sim1\%$, with the cosmic ray contribution rising to $\sim5\%$ at PeV energies, assuming roughly equal energy in non-thermal protons, non-thermal electrons and magnetic fields. In addition, we calculate associated $γ$-ray and neutrino spectra of the MAXI J1820+070 ejecta to investigate new detection methods with CTAO, which provide strong constraints on initial ejecta size of order $10^7$ Schwarzschild radii ($10^{-5}$ pc) assuming a period of adiabatic expansion.</p>

<p>2026-01-12, <strong>CP violating signal at DUNE in presence of nonstandard interactions and the role of second oscillation maxima</strong>, Rajrupa Banerjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07435v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.07435v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino oscillation among the three active neutrino flavors is well established and supported by experiments at diverse length scales and energy scales. It may be noted that five of the neutrino oscillation parameters in the three-flavor paradigm, namely the three mixing angles ($θ_{12}$, $θ_{13}$, $θ_{23}$) and the two mass-squared differences ($Δm^{2}_{21}$, $Δm^{2}_{31}$) are measured to a reasonable degree of precision. The three unknowns that are expected to be deciphered in the near future are the Dirac CP phase, $δ$, the neutrino mass ordering, and the octant of $θ_{23}$. The next generation of long baseline experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), aims to resolve these unanswered questions. In the present work, by considering DUNE as an example, we assess the ability of long baseline experiments to extricate the intrinsic contribution from observables related to CP violation in scenarios considering SI and beyond. Additionally, we analyze the role of the second oscillation maximum in addressing the above mentioned questions. By carrying out event level and statistical analyses, we assess the potential of DUNE to probe CP violation effects both within and beyond the standard paradigm.</p>

<p>2026-01-12, <strong>Asymmetric distribution of Fe-peak elements in Cassiopeia A revealed by XRISM</strong>, Toshiki Sato et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07394v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.07394v1</a></p>

<p>The elemental abundances of the Fe-peak elements (such as Cr, Mn, Fe and Ni) and Ti are important for understanding the environment of explosive nuclear burning for the core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe). In particular, the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, which is well known for its asymmetric structure, contains three ``Fe-rich blobs,’’ and the composition of the Fe-peak elements within these structures could be related to the asymmetry of the supernova explosion. We report a highly asymmetric distribution of the Fe-peak elements in Cassiopeia A as revealed by XRISM observations. We found that the southeastern Fe-rich region has a significant Mn emission above the 4$σ$ confidence level, while the northwestern Fe-rich region has no clear signature. In addition to the significant difference in Mn abundance across these regions, our observations show that the Ti/Fe, Mn/Cr, and Ni/Fe ratios vary from region to region. The observed asymmetric distribution of Fe-peak elements could be produced by (1) the mixing of materials from different burning layers of the supernova, (2) the asymmetric distribution of the electron fraction in the progenitor star and/or (3) the local dependence of the neutrino irradiation in the supernova innermost region. Future spatially resolved spectroscopy of Cassiopeia A using X-ray microcalorimeters will enable more detailed measurements of the distribution and composition of these elements, providing a unique tool for testing asymmetric supernova physics.</p>

<p>2026-01-12, <strong>Atmospheric Mass-Squared Splitting at Sub-Percent Precision as a $CPT$ Symmetry Probe</strong>, T. V. Ngoc et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07269v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.07269v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we present an improved test of $CPT$ symmetry in the neutrino sector by analyzing the atmospheric mass-squared splittings, $Δm^2_{31}$ and $Δ\overline{m}^2_{31}$, using on-going JUNO and future DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande experiments. Our study focuses on the discrepancy $δ_{ν\overlineν}(Δm^2_{31}) = Δm^2_{31} - Δ\overline{m}^2_{31}$, achieving unprecedented precision by exploiting the high statistics and reduced systematic uncertainties of these facilities. The combined analysis yields a sensitivity to $CPT$ violation at the level of $2\times 10^{-5}~\text{eV}^2$ at $3σ$ confidence level, representing a $60\%$ improvement over the joint T2K-NO$ν$A-JUNO analysis. These results highlight the crucial role of multi-experiment synergies in testing fundamental symmetries of nature.</p>

<p>2026-01-13, <strong>Search for Cosmic Ray Electron Boosted Dark Matter with the CDEX-10 Experiment</strong>, R. Xu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08746v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.08746v1</a></p>

<p>We present new constraints on the cosmic ray electron boosted light dark matter (CReDM) using the 205.4 kg$\cdot$day data of the CDEX-10 experiment located at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. The cosmic ray electron spectrum and distribution in the Galaxy are generated by the $\tt GALPROP$ code package. In the calculation process of DM-electron scattering process in the Galaxy, we consider the energy-dependency of the DM-electron scattering cross section. The constraints on CReDM are set for both heavy and light mediator scenarios using the CDEX-10 dataset. The result exceeds previous Standard Halo Model (SHM) limits for DM mass lower than 0.6 MeV in heavy mediator case and corresponds to the best sensitivity among all direct detection experiments from 1 keV to 0.5 MeV in the light mediator scenario.</p>

<p>2026-01-13, <strong>One-Loop Tensor Power Spectrum from a Non-Minimally Coupled Spectator Field during Inflation</strong>, Zhe Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08675v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.08675v1</a></p>

<p>We compute the full one-loop corrections to the primordial tensor power spectrum in an inflationary scenario with a non-minimally coupled spectator field, using the in-in formalism. We derive semi-analytic results for the scalar-sourced one-loop tensor spectrum and the effective tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ . We consider two representative coupling functions: a localized Gaussian dip (Model G), which leads to moderate loop corrections, and a rapidly oscillatory coupling (Model O), which can yield much larger loop contributions. For Model G, we find a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ correction to $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ while Model O can significantly enhance $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ by several orders of magnitude (relative to the tree-level value). We further calculate the energy density of primordial gravitational waves. Assuming that primordial black holes with mass $10^{-12}M_{\odot}$ generated in this scenario, constitute all of the dark matter, we find that the results are several orders of magnitude lower than the sensitivities of Taiji/TianQin/LISA.</p>

<p>2026-01-13, <strong>Design and construction of a cryogenic subcooler-box for supplying single phase supercritical helium to dark matter and gravitational wave experiments</strong>, Udai Raj Singh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08496v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.08496v1</a></p>

<p>We report on the design, development, and installation of the ALPS Cryo-Platform Subcooler Box (ACPS), which is part of the cryogenic platform being established in the HERA North Hall at DESY to supply helium for cooling large-scale dark-matter and gravitational-wave experiments with very high heat loads. The ACPS is capable of subcooling supercritical helium supplied via the 1.6-km-long HERA transfer line by means of a pipe heat exchanger immersed in a subcooler bath filled with liquid helium produced through Joule-Thomson valves. It is also equipped with numerous cryogenic components, including control valves, flow meters, and safety valves, enabling experimental operation to be carried out directly by the ACPS itself and thereby reducing the cryogenic requirements imposed on the experiments.

<p>In this article, we investigate the possibility that the large-scale magnetic fields observed in galaxies, of the order of microgauss, arise naturally from a complex Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM) halo charged under a local $U(1)$ symmetry. Extending our previous work, where multistate SFDM solutions were shown to form ``gravitational atoms’’ capable of explaining the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies (VPOS), we analyze here the coupled dynamics of the scalar and a gauge field at the perturbative level. By solving the perturbed Klein-Gordon and gauge-field equations, we find the temporal evolution and show that the spatial structure of the induced electromagnetic fields is governed by the same spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics that characterize the ground and excited states of the multi-state SFDM halo. Remarkably, the presence of the gauge field does not modify the dark-matter density distribution, which preserves the multi-state configuration previously obtained. Our results demonstrate that a charged multi-state SFDM halo can generate coherent, large-scale magnetic fields whose morphology is determined by the excited modes of the scalar field, providing a unified framework in which both galactic magnetic fields and VPOS-like structures originate from the underlying quantum nature of dark matter.</p>

<p>The Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) is a proposed fixed-target missing momentum search for sub-GeV thermal relic dark matter. LDMX aims to probe thermal dark matter targets with 1016 electrons on target. Such an approach requires a high-repetition rate, low-current beam, with an average of one electron on target per event. These requirements are well-suited to the DArk Sector Experiments at LCLS-II (DASEL) facility, which will take advantage of the unused RF buckets between LCLS-II bunches to produce a well-defined low-current beam with a 26.9 ns bunch spacing. This document describes the results of a measurement of dark current in the Sector 30 transfer line (S30XL) of the LCLS-II beam, using a prototype of the LDMX trigger scintillator (TS) subsystem.</p>

<p>The gravitational dynamics of 3+1 dimensional covariant quantum spacetime in the IKKT or IIB matrix model is studied at one loop, combining the Yang-Mills-type matrix action with the induced Einstein-Hilbert action. This combined action leads to interesting modifications of the gravitational dynamics at long distances, governed by modified Einstein equations including an extra geometrical tensor interpreted as ‘‘mirage matter’’. In particular we find extra non-Ricci flat geometric modes with a non-standard dispersion relation, with features reminiscent of dark matter.</p>

<p>We present Sahyadri, a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations designed to enable precision studies of the low-redshift Universe with next-generation spectroscopic surveys. Sahyadri includes systematic variations of six cosmological parameters around Planck 2018 constraints, with seed-matched initial conditions enabling cosmological parameter derivatives. Each simulation evolves $2048^3$ particles in a periodic box of side length $200$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, yielding a particle mass of $m_{\rm{p}} = 8.1 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial Planck 2018 cosmology. This resolution enables robust identification of dark matter halos down to $M_{\rm min} = 3.2 \times 10^{9}$ $h^{-1}$ $M_\odot$, which represents a factor of $\sim$25 improvement over the AbacusSummit suite, and is over two orders of magnitude better than the Quijote and Aemulus suites. We estimate that approximately 40% of DESI BGS galaxies at redshift $z &lt; 0.15$ - roughly 1.6 million objects - reside in halos accessible to Sahyadri but beyond the reach of existing parameter-varying simulation suites. We demonstrate Sahyadri’s capabilities through measurements of the matter power spectrum, halo mass function and power spectrum, and beyond 2-point statistics such as the Voronoi volume function and $k^{\rm th}$ nearest neighbour statistics, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and significant sensitivity to $Ω_{\rm m}$ variations. We implement a custom compression scheme reducing storage requirements by a factor of $\sim$3 while maintaining sub-percent clustering accuracy. Key data products will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>What flavour structure of $t$-channel thermal dark matter remains compatible with current flavour physics and direct detection bounds? We broadly chart the space of hypotheses using the framework of flavour symmetries and their breaking patterns. We then focus on scenarios in which the fermionic dark matter and its scalar mediator are flavour singlets, falling into the class of rank-1 flavour violation. For two representative benchmarks, quarkphilic ($q_L$) and leptophilic ($e_R$), we perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis, fitting the relic abundance and examining the interplay among flavour observables, direct detection, and collider searches. Our results quantify the allowed deviations from flavour-symmetric limits and assess the discovery prospects in future flavour and direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>The properties of substructure in galaxy clusters, exquisitely probed by gravitational lensing, offer a stringent test of dark matter models. Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass–dominated by dark matter–over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $γ\gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \lesssim 0.01\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts. Additionally, the observed radial distribution of subhalos hosting bright cluster member galaxies, explicitly modeled in the lens reconstructions, remains incompatible with CDM. Together, these small-scale stress tests reveal an intriguing paradox and challenge the dark matter microphysics of purely collisionless CDM and motivate hybrid scenarios, such as a dual-component model with both CDM and SIDM, or entirely new classes of dark matter theories.</p>

<p>The rotation velocities of disc galaxies trace dark matter halo structure, providing direct constraints on the galaxy–halo connection. We construct a Bayesian forward model to connect the dark matter halo population predicted by $Λ$CDM with an observed sample of disc galaxies (SPARC) through their maximum rotation velocities. Our approach combines a subhalo abundance matching scheme (accounting for assembly bias) with a parameterised halo response to galaxy formation. When assuming no correlation between selection in the SPARC survey and halo properties, reproducing the observed velocities requires strong halo expansion, low abundance matching scatter ($&lt;0.15$ dex at $1σ$) and a halo proxy that strongly suppresses the stellar masses in satellite haloes. This is in clear tension with independent clustering constraints. Allowing for SPARC-like galaxies to preferentially populate low $\Vmax$ haloes at fixed virial mass greatly improves the goodness-of-fit and resolves these tensions: the preferred halo response shifts to mild contraction, the abundance matching scatter increases to $\sint = 0.19^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ dex and the proxy becomes consistent with clustering. However, the inferred selection threshold is extreme, implying that SPARC galaxies occupy the lowest ${\sim}16$ per cent of the $\Vmaxhalo$ distribution at fixed $\Mvir$. Moreover, even with selection, the inferred scatter remains in statistical disagreement with the low-mass clustering constraints, which are most representative of the SPARC galaxies in our sample. Our analysis highlights the advantage of augmenting clustering-based constraints on the galaxy–halo connection with kinematics and suggests a possible tension using current data.</p>

<p>We model intrinsic alignments (IA) in Euclid’s Flagship simulation to investigate its impact on Euclid’s weak lensing signal. Our IA implementation in the Flagship simulation takes into account photometric properties of galaxies as well as their dark matter host halos. We compare simulations against theory predictions, determining the parameters of two of the most widely used IA models: the Non Linear Alignment (NLA) and the Tidal Alignment and Tidal Torquing (TATT) models. We measure the amplitude of the simulated IA signal as a function of galaxy magnitude and colour in the redshift range $0.1&lt;z&lt;2.1$. We find that both NLA and TATT can accurately describe the IA signal in the simulation down to scales of $6$-$7 \,h^{-1}\,$Mpc. We measure alignment amplitudes for red galaxies comparable to those of the observations, with samples not used in the calibration procedure. For blue galaxies, our constraints are consistent with zero alignments in our first redshift bin $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3$, but we detect a non-negligible signal at higher redshift, which is, however, consistent with the upper limits set by observational constraints. Additionally, several hydrodynamical simulations predict alignment for spiral galaxies, in agreement with our findings. Finally, the evolution of alignment with redshift is realistic and comparable to that determined in the observations. However, we find that the commonly adopted redshift power-law for IA fails to reproduce the simulation alignments above $z=1.1$. A significantly better agreement is obtained when a luminosity dependence is included, capturing the intrinsic luminosity evolution with redshift in magnitude-limited surveys. We conclude that the Flagship IA simulation is a useful tool for translating current IA constraints into predictions for IA contamination of Euclid-like samples.</p>

<p>We propose a novel gravitational mechanism for the non-thermal production of dark matter driven by curvature-induced tachyonic instabilities after inflation. Departing from the commonly studied non-minimal couplings to gravity, our framework considers a real spectator scalar field coupled quadratically to spacetime curvature invariants. We show that the rapid reorganization of spacetime curvature at the end of inflation can dynamically render the dark matter field tachyonic, triggering a short-lived phase of spontaneous symmetry breaking and explosive particle production. As a concrete and theoretically controlled example, we focus on the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. By combining analytical estimates with fully non-linear $3+1$ classical lattice simulations, we track the out-of-equilibrium evolution of the system and compute the resulting dark matter abundance. We find that this purely gravitational mechanism can robustly reproduce the observed dark matter relic density over a wide range of masses and inflationary scales, providing also a simple fitting function that enables a lattice-independent application of our results.</p>

<p>Small-scale discrepancies in the standard Lambda cold dark matter paradigm have motivated the exploration of alternative dark matter (DM) models, such as warm dark matter (WDM). We investigate the constraining power of galaxy scaling relations on cosmological, astrophysical, and WDM parameters through a joint analysis of hydrodynamic simulations and observational data. Our study is based on the DREAMS project and combines large-volume uniform-box simulations with high-resolution Milky Way zoom-in runs in a $Λ$WDM cosmology. To ensure consistency between the different simulation sets, we apply calibrations to account for resolution effects, allowing us to exploit the complementary strengths of the two suites. We compare simulated relations, including stellar size, DM mass and fraction within the stellar half-mass radius, and the total-to-stellar mass ratio, with two complementary galaxy samples: the SPARC catalog of nearby spirals and the LVDB catalog of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume. Using a bootstrap-based fitting procedure, we show that key cosmological parameters ($Ω_m$, $σ_8$) and supernova feedback strength can be recovered with good accuracy, particularly from the uniform-box simulations. While the WDM particle mass remains unconstrained, the zoom-in simulations reveal subtle WDM-induced trends at low stellar masses in both the DM mass and total-to-stellar mass ratio. We also find that the galaxy stellar mass function exhibits a measurable dependence on the WDM particle mass below log10(M_*/Msun) &lt;~ 8, which appears separable from the impact of feedback, suggesting it as a promising complementary probe. Our results highlight the importance of combining multi-resolution simulations with diverse observational datasets to jointly constrain baryonic processes and DM properties.</p>

<p>Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data reveal deviations from $Λ$CDM cosmology, conventionally attributed to dynamical dark energy (DE). We demonstrate that these deviations are equally, if not better, explained by interactions between dark matter and dark energy (IDE), without requiring a time-varying DE equation of state. Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models – coupled quintessence and coupled fluid – against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$σ$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $Λ$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms.</p>

<p>The high value of the cosmic microwave dipole may be telling us that dark matter is macroscopic rather than a fundamental particle. The possible presence of a significant dark matter component in the form of primordial black holes suggests that dark halo formation simulations should be commenced well before redshift z = 100. Unlike standard CDM candidates, PBHs behave as dense, non-relativistic matter from their inception in the radiation-dominated era. This allows them to seed gravitational potential wells and begin clustering earlier. We find that starting N-body simulations at redshifts even before matter-radiation equality yield galaxy bulk flow velocities that are systematically larger than those predicted by standard LCDM models. The early, high-mass concentrations established by PBHs lead to a more rapid and efficient gravitational acceleration of surrounding baryonic and dark matter, generating larger peculiar velocities that remain coherent over scales of hundreds of Mpc. Furthermore, a sub-population of PBHs in the 10^-20 to 10^-17 solar mass range would lose a non-negligible fraction of their mass via Hawking radiation over cosmological timescales. This evaporation process converts matter into radiation, so a time-varying matter density parameter, Omega_m’, is introduced, which behaves like a boosted radiation term in the Friedmann equation. This dynamic term acts to reduce the Hubble tension. A higher effective Omega_r in the early universe reduces the sound horizon at the epoch of recombination. PBH mass loss also influences fits to the equation of state parameter, w, at low redshift. The naive N-body modelling presented here suggests investigation with tried and tested cosmology codes should be carried out, by introducing mass losing PBHs and starting the evolution as early as practicable.</p>

<p>Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful probe of the cosmic expansion history far beyond the redshift range accessible to Type Ia supernovae. However, the calibration of GRB luminosity correlations is hindered by the circularity problem, which arises from assuming a fiducial cosmological model during calibration. In this work, we perform a model independent calibration of GRB luminosity relations using observational Hubble parameter H(z) data from the A220 and J220 compilations, thereby avoiding explicit cosmological assumptions. We employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct the calibration relation directly from the data. In addition, we implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) framework as an alternative approach, enabling a data driven treatment of both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The calibrated GRB sample is used to constrain the Amati relation, and we systematically compare the outcomes obtained from different calibration techniques and datasets. While the Amati Parameters obtained from GRBs caibrated from the ANN and BNN results are consistent with previous low redshifts calibrations using model-independent methods, the BNN approach provides a more robust framework.</p>

<p>We present a new empirical relation between the standardized magnitude ($m$) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and redshift ($z$). Using Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR, we find a negative linear correlation between $m-5\log(z(1+z))$ and $z$, implying that their magnitude–redshift relation can be parametrized with just two parameters: an intercept $\mathcal{M}$ and a slope $b$. This relation corresponds to the luminosity distance $d_L(z)=c\,H_0^{-1}z(1+z)10^{bz/5}$ and is valid up to at least $z\simeq1.1$. It outperforms the $Λ$CDM and flat $w$CDM models and the (2,1) Padé approximant for $d_L(z)$, and performs comparably to the flat $Λ$CDM model and the (2,1) Padé($j_0=1$) model of Hu et al. Furthermore, the relation is stable in the absence of low-$z$ SNe, making it suitable for fitting Hubble diagrams of SNe Ia without the need to add a low-$z$ sample. In deep fields in particular, assuming that the large-scale density is independent of the comoving radial coordinate, $b\propto q_0+1$. We fit the empirical relation to SN data in eight deep-field regions and find that their fitted $\mathcal{M}$ and $b$ parameters are consistent within $1.6\,σ$, in agreement with isotropy. The inferred $q_0$ values, ranging from $-0.6$ to $-0.4$, are consistent within $1.5\,σ$ and significantly lower than zero, indicating statistically consistent cosmic acceleration across all eight regions. We apply the empirical relation to the DES-Dovekie and Amalgame SN samples, finding $b$ values consistent with those from DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+. Finally, using the empirical relation in the hemispheric comparison method applied to Pantheon+ up to $z=1.1$, we find no evidence for anisotropies in $\mathcal{M}$ and $b$.</p>

<p>We present a spatially dependent framework for the existence and propagation of nonlinear kinetic Alfvén (KA) structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). Using a multi-component analytical model that incorporates the diffuse warm ionized medium together with localized H II regions, supernova remnants (SNR), and stellar-wind bubbles (SWB), we derive location-dependent coefficients governing KA dispersion and nonlinearity. The reductive perturbation method is applied to obtain Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, enabling the characterization of solitons under realistic astrophysical conditions. Numerical analysis demonstrates how superthermality, plasma $β$, temperature, and density gradients modulate soliton amplitude, width, and stability. Our results reveal distinct exclusion zones (EZs) for KA solitons in high-$β$ HII regions and SWB/SNR interiors, as well as ultra low-$β$ regions near central pulsar wind nebulae. While H II regions exhibit simple Gaussian-driven depletions, the complex ``hole-and-shell” morphologies of SWBs and SNRs imprint sharp spatial variations and discontinuities on soliton properties. This study establishes a direct link between macroscopic ISM morphology, ion-kinetic scale dissipation, and the emergence of coherent Alfvénic activity, with implications for radio scattering, pulsar scintillation, and fine-scale signatures in astrophysical observations.</p>

<p>Type Ia supernovae, type II supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are important sites of stellar nucleosynthesis, but they differ greatly in their rates, their location within a galaxy, and the mean thermal energy and abundance distribution of their ejecta. In earlier papers in this series we have shown that a significant fraction of metals newly synthesized by type II supernovae are promptly lost to galactic winds – i.e., galactic winds are metal loaded. Here we investigate whether the elements returned by type Ia supernovae and AGB stars are similarly metal loaded, or whether metal loading varies significantly with nucleosynthetic site. We use a series of high-resolution ``tall box’’ simulations of the interstellar medium with the \quokka~GPU-accelerated code, within which we systematically vary the galaxy gas surface density, metallicity, and the scale heights and relative rates of the different nucleosynthetic sources. We show that the metal loadings of galactic winds differ substantially between metals produced by different sources, with typical variations at the level of $\approx 0.3$ dex, a phenomenon we term differential metal loading. Which set of metals suffers preferential loss from this phenomenon varies depending on the galactic environment, and is not easily predictable \textit{a priori}. Our findings call into question the the interpretation of diagnostics of galaxy formation, for example star formation timescales and initial mass functions, based on abundance diagnostics, since the abundance variations upon which these techniques rely are often at levels comparable to those we show can be induced by differential metal loading.</p>

<p>We present a quantitative symmetry-identification pipeline for astrophysical images based on Transformation Information (TI), an information measure of self-similarity under geometric transformations. TI is expressed as a Kullback-Leibler (cross-entropy) divergence between an image and its rotated or reflected counterpart on the overlapping domain. By scanning rotation angles and reflection axes, we obtain TI curves whose local minima identify symmetry operations. We validate the method on a wind-rose pattern and then apply it to planetary nebulae, where the recovered axes trace bipolar and multipolar lobes consistent with morphology-based classifications. Applying TI to supernova remnants yields estimate axes associated with protrusions, rims, and substructure. To emphasize global morphology, we introduce a thresholded two-level variant that compares binary silhouettes and can reveal outline-driven symmetries. Finally, we quantify symmetry using a minima prominence-to-width score and show that this compact descriptor separates Type Ia and core-collapse remnants into distinct populations for an X-ray sample. TI provides a non-parametric, reproducible framework for symmetry identification, classification and population studies.</p>

<p>We introduce an effective framework to model star-formation burstiness and use it to jointly fit galaxy UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), clustering, and H$α$/UV ratios, providing the first robust empirical evidence that early galaxies hosted in lower-mass halos are burstier. Using $z\sim 4-6$ observations, we find that galaxies show approximately $0.6$ dex of SFR variability if hosted in halos of $M_h = 10^{11}\, M_\odot$ (typical of $M_{\rm UV}\approx -19$ galaxies at $z = 6$). This translates into a scatter of $σ_{M_{\rm UV}}\approx 0.75$ in the UVLF, in line with past findings. Strikingly, we find that burstiness grows for galaxies hosted in smaller halos, reaching $\gtrsim 1$ dex for $M_h \leq 10^{9}\, M_\odot$ (corresponding to $σ_{M_{\rm UV}} \approx 1.5$ for faint $M_{\rm UV} \gtrsim -15$ galaxies). Extrapolating to higher redshifts, when small halos were more prevalent, the inferred mass-dependent burstiness can reproduce observed UVLFs up to $z\sim 17$ within 1$σ$, potentially alleviating the tension between pre- and post-JWST galaxy-formation models. Current observations allow us to constrain burst timescales to approximately $20$ Myr, consistent with expectations from supernova feedback, and suggest broad distributions of ionizing efficiencies at fixed $M_{\rm UV}$. Our results demonstrate that mass-dependent burstiness, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations, is critical for understanding the mass assembly of early galaxies.</p>

<p>We present 121 days of multi-band (\Bband, \gband, \rband, \iband) optical photometry of the Type Ia supernova SN 2025bvm, obtained with the COLIBRI telescope at OAN-SPM. The light curves show a photometric decline of $Δm_{15}(B) = 0.867 \pm 0.051$~mag, characteristic of a slow-declining Type Ia supernova. After correcting for host galaxy extinction ($E(B-V)_{host} = 0.308 \pm 0.030$~mag) and adopting a distance of 70~Mpc, we derive a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -19.13 \pm 0.40$~mag. This luminosity is fully consistent with its slow decline rate, placing SN 2025bvm within the population of normal Type Ia supernovae. We conclude that SN 2025bvm is a normal Type Ia supernova, whose photometric properties, such as a slow late-time decline and a prominent \iband-band secondary maximum, suggest an explosion that resulted in a particularly massive ejecta.</p>

<p>Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are hydrogen-rich explosions embedded in dense circumstellar medium (CSM), which gives rise to their characteristic narrow hydrogen emission lines. The nature of their progenitors and pre-explosion mass loss remains, however, poorly understood. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we analyze the local stellar environments of a volume-limited sample (z &lt; 0.02) of 31 SNe IIn. The environments of SNe IIn are found to be very diverse; the SN could reside within a star-forming region (Class 1), outside a star-forming region (Class 2), or in much older environments without any obvious signs of star formation (Class 3). The bright SNe IIn (Mpeak &lt; -19.5 mag) predominantly occur in Class 1 environments, indicative of very massive progenitors, while the faint SNe IIn (Mpeak &lt; -15.5 mag) are associated with Classes 2 and 3 environments, suggesting the least massive progenitors. Meanwhile, normal SNe IIn with -19.5 &lt; Mpeak &lt; -15.5 mag occur in all three types of environments, suggesting a diversity in their progenitor mass, lifetime, and evolutionary pathways. Moreover, the directly detected SN IIn progenitors are systematically brighter and/or bluer than the youngest stellar populations in their environments, suggesting that they were either in a non-quiescent state when observed or had experienced binary interactions. These results point to a significantly diverse origin for progenitors of SNe IIn, spanning a wide range of masses, evolutionary stages, and potential binary interaction histories.</p>

<p>2026-01-12, <strong>A Study of Two Type IIb Supernovae: SNe 2008aq and 2019gaf</strong>, Mridweeka Singh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07450v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.07450v1</a></p>

<p>We present photometric and spectroscopic studies of two core-collapse supernovae (SNe) 2008aq and 2019gaf in the optical wavelengths. Light curve and spectral sequence of both the SNe are similar to those of other Type IIb SNe. The pre-maximum spectrum of SN~2008aq showed prominent H $α$ lines, the He lines started appearing in the near maximum spectrum. The near maximum spectrum of SN~2019gaf shows shallow H$α$ absorption and He lines with almost similar strength. Both the SNe show transition from hydrogen-dominated spectra to helium-dominated spectra within a month after maximum brightness. The velocity evolution of SN~2008aq matches well with those of other well-studied Type IIb SNe, while SN~2019gaf shows higher velocities. Close to maximum light, the H $α$ and He I line velocities of SN~2019gaf are $\sim$ 2000 km sec$^{-1}$ and $\sim$ 4000 km sec$^{-1}$ higher than other well-studied Type IIb SNe. Semi-analytical modeling indicates SN~2019gaf to be a more energetic explosion with a smaller ejecta mass than SN~2008aq. The zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of the progenitor estimated using the nebular spectra of SN~2008aq ranges between 13 to 20 M$_\odot$, while for SN~2019gaf, the inferred ZAMS mass is between 13 to 25 M$_\odot$. The [O I] to [Ca II] lines flux ratio favors a less massive progenitor star in a binary system for both the SNe.</p>

<p>2026-01-12, <strong>Possible evidence for a pair-instability supernova nature of ultra-early JWST sources</strong>, Andrea Ferrara et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07374v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.07374v1</a></p>

<p>Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of unexpectedly bright sources at ultra-high redshift ($z &gt; 15$), challenging current models of early galaxy formation. One extreme example is ‘Capotauro’, an F356W-dropout identified in the CEERS survey and initially interpreted as a luminous galaxy at $z\sim30$, but subsequently found to be variable over an $\sim 800$ day baseline. Motivated by this variability, we explore the alternative hypothesis that Capotauro is a pair-instability supernova (PISN) originating from a massive ($250-260\,M_\odot$), metal-free star. Using state-of-the-art PISN light curves, spectral energy distributions, and synthetic spectra, we show that a PISN at $z\simeq 15$ can plausibly reproduce the observed brightness, temporal evolution, photometry, and NIRSpec spectrum. We compare this scenario with alternative interpretations, including a local Y0 brown dwarf, and discuss observational tests to discriminate among them. If confirmed, this event would provide a rare window onto Population III stars, and highlights the importance of transient contamination in ultra-high redshift galaxy samples.</p>

<p>The formation of structure in the Universe at large scales is dominated by gravity, with baryonic physics becoming significant at $\sim{\rm Mpc}$ scales. To capture the impact of baryonic physics, cosmological simulations must model gas dynamics and a host of relevant astrophysical processes. A recent extension of the Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC) couples its gravity solver with a modern smoothed particle hydrodynamics method. This extension incorporates sub-resolution models for chemical enrichment, black hole and star formation, AGN kinetic and thermal feedback, supernova-driven feedback, galactic winds, and metal-line cooling. We present an inference framework based on high-fidelity emulators to aid in model calibration against observational targets, e.g., the galaxy stellar mass function, radial gas density profiles, and the cluster gas fraction. The emulators are trained on simulation suites comprising 64 boxes with side-length $128\,h^{-1}$Mpc and 16 boxes with side-length $256\,h^{-1}$Mpc with $2\times 512^3$ and $2\times 1024^3$ particles, respectively. Our analysis reveals two distinct AGN kinetic feedback modes – a low-feedback mode yielding strong agreement with the observed radial gas density profiles of massive X-ray clusters, and a high-feedback mode providing a better fit to cluster gas fraction data, but systematically underestimating gas densities in inner regions.</p>

<p>We present a radio analysis of the recently identified supernova remnant G321.3-3.9 using archival multi-wavelength data spanning 88-2304 MHz. The source exhibits an elliptical shell-like morphology (1.3 deg x 1.7 deg) and a relatively flat non-thermal spectral index of alpha = -0.40 +/- 0.03. The distance is estimated using both the Sigma-D relation (1.6-2.9 kpc) and tentative associations with HI structures, the latter suggesting a near-side solution of 2.5-3.3 kpc, though the physical connection remains uncertain.</p>

<p>2026-01-12, <strong>Slow White Dwarf Mergers as a New Galactic Source of Trans-Iron Elements</strong>, Umberto Battino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07151v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.07151v1</a></p>

<p>The astrophysical origins of the heaviest stable elements that we observe today in the Solar System are still not fully understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that H-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary sys- tem exploding as type Ia supernovae could be an efficient p-process source beyond iron. However, both observational evidence and stellar models challenge the required frequency of these events. In this work, we calculate the evolution and nucleosynthesis in slowly merging carbon-oxygen WDs. As our models approach the Chandrasekhar mass during the merger phase, the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg neutron source reaction is activated in the external layers of the primary WD, where the carbon-rich material accreted from the secondary WD is burned via the 12C+12C reaction, which provides the necessary α-particles via the 12C(12C,α)20Ne channel. The resulting neutron capture abundance distribution closely resembles a weak s-process one and peaks at Zr, which is overpro- duced by a factor of 30 compared to solar. The mass of the most external layers enriched in first-peak s-process elements crucially depends on the 12C+12C re- action rate, ranging between 0.05 Msun and ~0.1 Msun. These results indicate that slow white dwarf mergers can efficiently produce the lightest p-process iso- topes (such as 74Se, 78Kr, 84Sr, 92Mo and 94Mo) via γ-induced reactions if they explode via a delayed detonation mechanism, or eject the unburned external layers highly enriched in first peak s-process elements in the case of a pure deflagration. In both cases, we propose for the first time that slow WD mergers in binary systems may be a new relevant source for elements heavier than iron.</p>
