<p>2025-03-10, <strong>First differential measurement of the single $\mathbfπ^+$ production cross section in neutrino neutral-current scattering</strong>, K. Abe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06849v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.06849v1</a></p>

<p>Since its first observation in the 1970s, neutrino-induced neutral-current single positive pion production (NC1$\pi^+$) has remained an elusive and poorly understood interaction channel. This process is a significant background in neutrino oscillation experiments and studying it further is critical for the physics program of next-generation accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments. In this Letter we present the first double-differential cross-section measurement of NC1$\pi^+$ interactions using data from the ND280 detector of the T2K experiment collected in $\nu$-beam mode. We compare the results on a hydrocarbon target to the predictions of several neutrino interaction generators and final-state interaction models. While model predictions agree with the differential results, the data shows a weak preference for a cross-section normalization approximately 30\% higher than predicted by most models studied in this Letter.</p>

<p>2025-03-10, <strong>Signal selection and model-independent extraction of the neutrino neutral-current single $π^+$ cross section with the T2K experiment</strong>, K. Abe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06843v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.06843v1</a></p>

<p>This article presents a study of single $\pi^+$ production in neutrino neutral-current interactions (NC1$\pi^+$) using the ND280 detector of the T2K experiment. We report the largest sample of such events selected by any experiment, providing the first new data for this channel in over four decades and the first using a sub-GeV neutrino flux. The signal selection strategy and its performance are detailed together with validations of a robust cross section extraction methodology. The measured flux-averaged integrated cross-section is $ \sigma = (6.07 \pm 1.22 )\times 10^{-41} \,\, \text{cm}^2/\text{nucleon}$, 1.3~$\sigma~$ above the NEUT v5.4.0 expectation.</p>

<p>2025-03-10, <strong>Emulating the Non-Linear Matter Power-Spectrum in Mixed Axion Dark Matter Models</strong>, Dennis Fremstad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07277v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.07277v1</a></p>

<p>In order to constrain ultra light dark matter models with current and near future weak lensing surveys we need the predictions for the non-linear dark matter power-spectrum. This is commonly extracted from numerical simulations or from using semi-analytical methods. For ultra light dark matter models such numerical simulations are often very expensive due to the need of having a very low force-resolution often limiting them to very small simulation boxes which do not contain very large scales. In this work we take a different approach by relying on fast, approximate $N$-body simulations. In these simulations, axion physics are only included in the initial conditions, allowing us to run a large number of simulations with varying axion and cosmological parameters. From our simulation suite we use machine learning tools to create an emulator for the ratio of the dark matter power-spectrum in mixed axion models - models where dark matter is a combination of CDM and axion - to that of $\Lambda$CDM. The resulting emulator only needs to be combined with existing emulators for $\Lambda$CDM to be able to be used in parameter constraints. We compare the emulator to semi-analytical methods, but a more thorough test to full simulations to verify the true accuracy of this approach is not possible at the present time and is left for future work.</p>

<p>2025-03-10, <strong>MaNGA DynPop – VII. A Unified Bulge-Disk-Halo Model for Explaining Diversity in Circular Velocity Curves of 6000 Spiral and Early-Type Galaxies</strong>, Kai Zhu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06968v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.06968v1</a></p>

<p>We derive circular velocity curves (CVCs) from stellar dynamical models for $\sim6{,}000$ nearby galaxies in the final data release of the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey with integral-field spectroscopy, exploring connections between the inner gravitational potential (traced by CVC amplitude/shape) and galaxy properties. The maximum circular velocity ($V_{\rm circ}^{\rm max}$) and circular velocity at the half-light radius ($V_{\rm circ}(R_{\rm e}^{\rm maj})$) both scale linearly with the stellar second velocity moment $\sigma_{\rm e}^2\equiv\langle V^2+\sigma^2\rangle$ within the half-light isophote, following $V_{\rm circ}^{\rm max} \approx 1.75\sigma_{\rm e}$ (8$\%$ error) and $V_{\rm circ}(R_{\rm e}^{\rm maj}) \approx 1.65\sigma_{\rm e}$ (9$\%$ error). CVC shapes (rising, flat, declining) correlate strongly with structural and stellar population properties: declining curves dominate in massive, early-type, bulge-dominated galaxies with old, metal-rich stars and early quenching, while rising CVCs prevail in disk-dominated systems with younger stellar populations and ongoing star formation. Using a unified bulge-disk-halo model, we predict CVC shapes with minimal bias, identifying three governing parameters: bulge-to-total mass ratio ($B/T$), dark matter fraction within $R_{\rm e}$, and bulge Sersic index. The distribution of CVC shapes across the mass-size plane reflects evolutionary pathways driven by (i) in situ star formation (spurring bulge growth) and (ii) dry mergers. This establishes CVC morphology as a diagnostic for galaxy evolution, linking dynamical signatures to structural and stellar population histories.</p>

<p>2025-03-10, <strong>Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae. II. Galaxy properties</strong>, Santiago González-Gaitán et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07233v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.07233v1</a></p>

<p>The interstellar medium (ISM) has a number of tracers such as the Na I D 5890, 5896 AA absorption lines that are evident in the spectra of galaxies but also in those of individual astrophysical sources such as stars, novae or quasars. Here, we investigate narrow absorption features in the spectra of nearby supernovae (SNe) and compare them to local (&lt; 0.5 kpc) and global host galaxy properties. With a large and heterogeneous sample of spectra, we are able to recover the known relations of ISM with galaxy properties: larger columns of ISM gas are found in environments that are more massive, more actively star-forming, younger and viewed from a more inclined angle. Most trends are stronger for local than global properties, and we find that the ISM column density decreases exponentially with the offset from the host galaxy centre, as expected for a gas distribution following an exponential radial profile. We also confirm trends for the velocity of galactic outflows increasing with radius. The current study demonstrates the capability of individual light sources to serve as ubiquitous tracers of ISM properties across various environments and galaxies.</p>

<p>2025-03-10, <strong>Cosmic Ray bubbles from nova super remnants and their contribution to local cosmic ray spectra</strong>, Rubén López-Coto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07218v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.07218v1</a></p>

<p>Context: Several new phenomena have been surrounding the area of study of the repeating thermonuclear explosions called novae. For example, recurrent novae have been proven to be efficient cosmic ray hadronic accelerators thanks to the recent observations of RS Ophiuchi by different gamma-ray instruments. Novae have also demonstrated to have the ability to carve large cavities into the Interstellar Medium with parallelisms with the remnants of supernovae. We aim at calculating what is the effect of novae in their surrounding media and to which distances these effects dominate over the average quantities that are measured in the ISM. We calculate the filling factor of novae and their contribution to cosmic ray fluxes using cosmic ray propagation codes. To limit what is the atomic density of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) surrounding the region around RS Oph, we use Fermi-LAT observations of the region. The filling factor of novae in the Galaxy is not significant under all assumptions done in the paper. They do not dominate over the local cosmic ray fluxes, even at the lowest energies, for distances larger than a few parsec. The particle density of the ISM surrounding them is, however, very much modified, lowering it more than one order of magnitude with respect to galactic averages, confirming estimates done using other observatories. As a conclusion, even though at global galactic distances, novae do not seem to be dominating cosmic ray transport, they have the power to modify the conditions of their surrounding ISM over parsec distances.</p>

<p>2025-03-10, <strong>X-ray and radio data obtained by XMM-Newton and VLA constrain the stellar wind of the magnetic quasi-Wolf-Rayet star in HD45166</strong>, P. Leto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07205v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.07205v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, a powerful magnetic field was discovered in the hot helium star classified as a quasi-Wolf-Rayet star of ~2Msun, member of the HD45166 system. Upon its explosion as a core-collapse supernova, it is expected to produce a strongly magnetic neutron star, a magnetar. Among the key parameters governing the pre-supernova evolution is the amount of mass lost via stellar wind. However, the magnetic nature of this helium star is expected to affect its stellar wind making the estimation of the wind parameters uncertain. We report the first observations of HD45166 in X-rays with the XMM-Newton telescope and in radio with the VLA interferometer array. By placing the observation results in a theoretical framework, we aim to provide a reliable estimate of the wind strength of the magnetic qWR star. The X-ray properties are explained in the framework of the MCWS scenario, and the semi-analytic XADM model is applied to reproduce the X-ray emission. The thermal radio emission of the wind and its absorption effect on possible gyro-synchrotron emission from the underlying dipolar magnetosphere, sampled in 3D, are computed by integrating the radiative transfer equation. We did not detect radio emissions, this enabled us to set sensitive upper limits on the radio luminosity. The magnetic qWR star is a slow rotator, comparison with models reveals that the possible acceleration mechanisms occurring within its dynamical magnetosphere are not as efficient as in fast-rotating magnetic ApBp-type stars. In contrast, the system is detected in X-rays with log(L_X/L_bol)~ -5.6. Using suitable models, we constrain the mass lost from this magnetic quasi-Wolf-Rayet star as dot{M}~3e-10 Msun/yr. This novel empirical estimate of the mass-loss rate in a ~2Msun helium star confirms that it maintains super-Chandrasekhar mass till collapse and can produce a magnetar as its final evolutionary product.</p>

<p>2025-03-10, <strong>Effect of Nuclear Deformation on Electron Capture Cross-section on Chromium Isotopes</strong>, Asim Ullah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07165v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.07165v1</a></p>

<p>The electron capture plays significant role in the pre supernova and supernova evolutions of massive stars which in turn are of great importance in synthesizing heavy elements beyond iron. In this paper we study the effect of nuclear deformation on the computed electron capture cross section on selected even even chromium isotopes (464850Cr). The nuclear deformation parameters were computed using two different theoretical models: Interacting Boson Model (IBM 1) and Macroscopic (Yukawa plus exponential) microscopic (Folded Yukawa) model (Mac mic model). A third value of deformation parameter was adopted from experimental data. We chose the pn QRPA model to perform our calculations. The predictive power of the chosen model was first tested by calculating Gamow Teller (GT) strength distributions of selected fp shell nuclei where measured GT data was available. The calculated GT strength distributions were well fragmented over the energy range 0 12 MeV and were noted to be in decent agreement with experimental data. The total GT strength was found to increase (decrease) with decrease (increase) in the value of deformation parameter for the three chromium isotopes. The computed GT strength distributions satisfied the model independent Ikeda sum rule. The ECC were calculated as a function of the deformation parameter at core temperature 1.0 MeV. Our results show that the calculated ECC increased with increasing value of nuclear deformation.</p>
