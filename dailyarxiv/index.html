<p>2023-07-25, <strong>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection</strong>, João R. T. de Mello Neto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13638v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.13638v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos (UHE), with energies above 100 PeV, are unparalleled probes of the most energetic astrophysical sources and weak interactions at energies beyond the reach of accelerators. GRAND is an envisioned observatory of UHE particles - neutrinos, cosmic rays, and gamma rays - consisting of 200,000 radio antennas deployed in sub-arrays at different locations worldwide. GRAND aims to detect the radio emission from air showers induced by UHE particle interactions in the atmosphere and underground. For neutrinos, it aims to reach a flux sensitivity of $\sim 10^{-10}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$, with a sub-degree angular resolution, which would allow it to test the smallest predicted diffuse fluxes of UHE neutrinos and to discover point sources. The GRAND Collaboration operates three prototype detector arrays simultaneously: GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, GRANDProto300 in China, and GRAND@Auger in Argentina. The primary purpose of GRAND@Nan\c cay is to serve as a testbench for hardware and triggering systems. On the other hand, GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger are exploratory projects that pave the way for future stages of GRAND. GRANDProto300 is being built to demonstrate autonomous radio-detection of inclined air showers and study cosmic rays near the proposed transition between galactic and extragalactic sources. All three arrays are in the commissioning stages. It is expected that by 2028, the detector units of the final design could be produced and deployed, marking the establishment of two GRAND10k arrays in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. We will survey preliminary designs, simulation results, construction plans, and the extensive research program made possible by GRAND.</p>

<p>The vast amounts of data to be collected by the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) and its prototype - GRANDProto300 - require the use of a data format very efficient in terms of i/o speed and compression. At the same time, the data should be easily accessible, without the knowledge of the intricacies of the format, both for bulk processing and for detailed event-by-event analysis and reconstruction. We present the format and the structure prepared for GRAND data, the concept of the data-processing chain, and data-oriented and analysis-oriented interfaces written in Python.</p>

<p>2023-07-25, <strong>Flavor-dependent $U(1)$ extension inspired by lepton, baryon and color numbers</strong>, Duong Van Loi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13493v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.13493v1</a></p>

<p>There is no reason why the gauge symmetry extension is family universal as in the standard model and the most well-motivated models, e.g. left-right symmetry and grand unification. Hence, we propose a simplest extension of the standard model – a flavor-dependent $U(1)$ gauge symmetry – and find the new physics insight. For this aim, the $U(1)$ charge, called $X$, is expressed as $X=x B+y L$ in which $x$ and $y$ are free parameters as functions of flavor index, e.g. for a flavor $i$ they take $x_i$ and $y_i$ respectively, where $B$ and $L$ denote normal baryon and lepton numbers. Imposing a relation involved by the color number $3$, i.e. $-x_{1,2,\cdots,n}=x_{n+1,n+2,\cdots,n+m}=3y_{1,2,\cdots,n+m}\equiv 3z$, for arbitrarily nonzero $z$, we achieve a novel $U(1)$ theory with implied $X$-charge. This theory not only explains the origin of the number of observed fermion families but also offers a possible solution for both neutrino mass and dark matter, which differs from $B-L$ extension. Two typical models based on this idea are examined, yielding interesting results for flavor-changing neutral currents and particle colliders, besides those of neutrino mass and dark matter.</p>

<p>2023-07-25, <strong>High-energy neutrino constraints on cosmic-ray re-acceleration in radio halos of massive galaxy clusters</strong>, Kosuke Nishiwaki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13273v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.13273v1</a></p>

<p>A fraction of merging galaxy clusters host diffuse radio emission in their central region, termed as a giant radio halo (GRH). The most promising mechanism of GRHs is the re-acceleration of non-thermal electrons and positrons by merger-induced turbulence. However, the origin of these seed leptons has been under debate, and either protons or electrons can be primarily-accelerated particles. In this work, we demonstrate that neutrinos can be used as a probe of physical processes in galaxy clusters, and discuss possible constraints on the amount of relativistic protons in the intra-cluster medium with the existing upper limits by IceCube. We calculate radio and neutrino emission from massive ($&gt;10^{14}M_\odot$) galaxy clusters, using the cluster population model of Nishiwaki &amp; Asano (2022). This model is compatible with the observed statistics of GRHs, and we find that the contribution of GRHs to the isotropic radio background observed with the ARCADE-2 experiment should be subdominant. Our fiducial model predicts the all-sky neutrino flux that is consistent with IceCube’s upper limit from the stacking analysis. We also show that the neutrino upper limit gives meaningful constraints on the parameter space of the re-acceleration model, such as the electron-to-proton ratio of primary cosmic-rays and the magnetic field, and in particular the secondary scenario, where the seed electrons mostly originate from inelastic $pp$ collisions, can be constrained even in the presence of re-acceleration.</p>

<p>2023-07-25, <strong>The simulated performance of GRANDProto300</strong>, Kai-Kai Duan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13234v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.13234v1</a></p>

<p>GRANDProto300 is a 300-antenna prototype array of the envisioned GRAND (Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) project. The goal of GRANDProto300 is to detect radio signals emitted by cosmic ray-induced air showers, with energies ranging from $10^{16.5}$~eV to $10^{18.5}$~eV, which covers the transition region between Galactic and extragalactic sources. We use simulations to optimize the layout of GRANDProto300 and develop a shower reconstruction method. Based on them, we present the performance of GRANDProto300 for cosmic-ray detection, by means of its effective area, angular resolution, and energy resolution.</p>

<p>GRANDProto300 is the planned 300-antenna pathfinder array of the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), of which the first 100 detection units have been already produced. Its main goal is to demonstrate the viability of the detection of the radio emission from air showers initiated by inclined ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies of $10^{16.5}$ to $10^{18.5}$ eV, covering the purported transition region from their Galactic to extragalactic origin. The front-end readout system of each detection unit of GRANDProto300 processes signals from the radio antenna and the particle detector, generates the first-level trigger, and communicates with a central processing station. Based on earlier designs, we have built the first prototype of this system using two development boards and one self-designed front-end board. We present our new design that is improved and more economical than the earlier one, as well as test results and prospects for future work.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>Tip of the Red Giant Branch Bounds on the Neutrino Magnetic Dipole Moment Revisited</strong>, Noah Franz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13050v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.13050v1</a></p>

<p>We use a novel method to constrain the neutrino magnetic dipole moment ($\mu_{\nu}$) using the empirically-calibrated tip of the red giant branch I-band magnitude that fully accounts for uncertainties in stellar physics. Our method uses machine learning to emulate the results of stellar evolution codes. This reduces the I-Band magnitude computation time to milliseconds, which enables a Bayesian statistical analysis where $\mu_{\nu}$ is varied simultaneously with the stellar physics, allowing for a complete exploration of parameter space. We find the region $\mu_{\nu} \leq 6\times10^{-12}\mu_{\textrm{B}}$ (with $\mu_{\textrm{B}}$ the Bohr magneton), previously believed to be excluded, is unconstrained after accounting for degeneracies with stellar physics. It is likely that larger values are similarly unconstrained. We discuss the implications of our results for future neutrino magnetic dipole moment searches and for other astrophysical probes.</p>

<p>The IceCube Observatory at the South Pole has been operating in its full configuration since May 2011 with a duty cycle of about 99%. Its main component consists of a cubic-kilometer array of optical sensors deployed deep in the Glacial ice designed for the detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. A surface array for cosmic ray air shower detection, IceTop, and a denser inner subdetector, DeepCore, significantly enhance the capabilities of the observatory, making it a multipurpose facility. This list of contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Nagoya, Japan (July 26 - August 3, 2023) summarizes the latest results from IceCube covering a broad set of key questions in physics and astrophysics. The papers in this index are grouped topically to highlight IceCube contributions related to high-energy neutrino and multi-messenger astrophysics, cosmic-ray physics, low-energy neutrino transients such as Galactic supernovae, fundamental physics, detector calibration and event reconstruction, education and public outreach, and research and development for the IceCube Upgrade, a scheduled dense sensor infill complemented by calibration devices. Contributions related to IceCube-Gen2, the future extension of IceCube, are available in a separate collection.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>Leptohadronic Multimessenger Modeling of 324 Gamma-Ray Blazars</strong>, Xavier Rodrigues et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13024v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.13024v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux observed by the IceCube experiment is still under debate. In recent years there have been associations of neutrino events with individual blazars, which are active galaxies with relativistic jets pointing toward Earth, such as the source TXS 0506+056. From a theoretical perspective, the properties of these sources as neutrino emitters are not yet well understood. In this work we model a sample of 324 blazars detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), most of which are flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). This amounts to 34% of all FSRQs in the latest Fermi catalog. By numerically modelling the interactions of cosmic-ray electrons and protons, we explain the emitted multi-wavelength fluxes from each source and self-consistently predict the emitted neutrino spectrum. We demonstrate that the optical and GeV gamma-ray broadband features are generally well described by electron emission. For 33% of the blazars in our sample, a description of the observed X-ray spectrum benefits from an additional component from proton interactions, in agreement with recent studies of individual IceCube candidate blazars. We conclude that blazars that are brighter in GeV gamma rays tend to have a higher neutrino production efficiency but a lower best-fit baryonic loading. The predicted neutrino luminosity shows a positive correlation with the observed GeV gamma-ray flux and with the predicted MeV gamma-ray flux. By extrapolating the results for this sample, we show that the diffuse neutrino flux from the population of gamma-ray-bright blazars may be at the level of about 20% of the IceCube flux, in agreement with current limits from stacking analyses. We discuss the implications of our results for future neutrino searches and suggest promising sources for potential detections with future experiments.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>On the impact of the Migdal effect in reactor CE$ν$NS experiments</strong>, M. Atzori Corona et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12911v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.12911v1</a></p>

<p>The search for coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) using reactor antineutrinos represents a formidable experimental challenge, recently boosted by the observation of such a process at the Dresden-II reactor site using a germanium detector. This observation relies on an unexpected enhancement at low energies of the measured quenching factor with respect to the theoretical Lindhard model prediction, which implies an extra observable ionization signal produced after the nuclear recoil. A possible explanation for this additional contribution could be provided by the so-called Migdal effect, which however has never been observed. Here, we study in detail the impact of the Migdal contribution to the standard CE$\nu$NS signal calculated with the Lindhard quenching factor, finding that the former is completely negligible for observed energies below $\sim 0.3\,\mathrm{keV}$ where the signal is detectable, and thus unable to provide any contribution to CE$\nu$NS searches in this energy regime. To this purpose, we compare different formalisms used to describe the Migdal effect that intriguingly show a perfect agreement, making our findings robust.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>Probing mass orderings in presence of a very light sterile neutrino in a liquid argon detector</strong>, Animesh Chatterjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12885v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.12885v1</a></p>

<p>Results from experiments like LSND and MiniBooNE hint towards the possible presence of an extra eV scale sterile neutrino. The addition of such a neutrino will significantly impact the standard three flavour neutrino oscillations. In particular, it can give rise to additional degeneracies due to additional sterile parameters. For an eV scale sterile neutrino, the cosmological constraints dictate that the sterile state is heavier than the three active states. However, for lower masses of sterile neutrinos, it can be lighter than one and/or more of the three states. In such cases, the mass ordering of the sterile neutrinos also becomes unknown along with the mass ordering of the active states. In this paper, we explore the mass ordering sensitivity in the presence of a sterile neutrino assuming the mass squared difference $|\Delta_{41}|$ to be in the range $10^{-4} - 1$ eV$^2$. We study (i) how the ordering of the active states, i.e. the determination of the sign of $\Delta_{31}$ gets affected by the presence of a sterile neutrino in the above mass range, (ii) the possible determination of the sign of $\Delta_{41}$ for $\Delta_{41}$ in the range $10^{-4} - 0.1$ eV$^2$. This analysis is done in the context of a liquid argon detector using both beam neutrinos traveling a distance of 1300 km and atmospheric neutrinos which propagates through a distance ranging from 10 - 10000 km allowing resonant matter effects. Apart from presenting separate results from these sources, we also do a combined study and probe the synergy between these two in giving an enhanced sensitivity.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>First look at data from the 13-antenna setup of GRANDProto300 in northwest China</strong>, Peng-Xiong Ma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12769v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.12769v1</a></p>

<p>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, cosmic rays, and gamma rays, with energies above 100 PeV. GRAND targets the radio signals emitted by extensive air showers induced by the interaction of ultra-high-energy particles in the atmosphere, using an array of 200,000 radio antennas split into sub-arrays deployed worldwide. GRANDProto13 (GP13) is a 13-antenna demonstrator array deployed in February 2023 in the Gansu province of China, as a precursor for GRANDProto300, which will validate the detection principle of the GRAND experiment. Its goal is to measure the radio background present at the site, validate the design of the detection units and develop an autonomous radio trigger for air showers. We will describe GP13 and its operation, and show preliminary results on noise monitoring.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>Weak production of $η$ mesons induced by $ν_μ(\barν_μ)$ at MicroBooNE energies</strong>, A. Fatima et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12686v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.12686v1</a></p>

<p>We have studied neutral and charged current (anti)neutrino induced $\eta$ production off the free nucleon target at MicroBooNE energies, in the light of recent results reported by the MicroBooNE collaboration for the total $\eta$ production cross section. This study has been made using a theoretical model in which the weak hadronic current receives contribution from the nonresonant Born terms as well as from the resonance excitations. The Born terms are obtained using the SU(3) symmetric chiral model, used earlier in the study of $K-$meson production. The contribution from the resonance terms is considered from the excitation of five nucleon resonances viz. $S_{11}(1535)$, $S_{11}(1650)$, $P_{11}(1710)$, $P_{11}(1880)$, and $S_{11}(1895)$. To fix the parameters of the vector current interaction, this model is first used to study the electromagnetic production of $\eta$ mesons induced by real and virtual photons, and the theoretical results have been compared with the data from the MAINZ and JLab experiments. The partially conserved axial-vector current hypothesis and generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation are used to fix the parameters of the axial-vector current interaction. The results are presented for the total cross section for the neutral and charged current induced $\eta$ production, ratio of the cross sections for the charged current to neutral current, MicroBooNE flux averaged cross section $\langle \sigma \rangle$, $\left \langle \frac{d\sigma}{dQ^2} \right\rangle$ and $\left\langle \frac{d\sigma}{dp_\eta} \right\rangle$, which may be useful in the future analysis of MicroBooNE as well as other accelerator and atmospheric neutrino experiments being performed in the ${\cal O}$(1)~GeV energy region.</p>

<p>Due to finite masses and mixing, for neutrinos propagation in space-time, there is a chiral oscillation between left- and right- chiral neutrinos, besides the usual oscillation between different generations. The probability of chiral oscillation is suppressed by a factor of $m^2/E^2$ making the effect small for relativistic neutrinos. However, for non-relativistic neutrinos, this effects can be significant. In matter, the equation of motion is modified. When neutrinos produced in weak interaction pass through the matter, the effective energies are split into two different ones depending on the helicity of the neutrino. This results in different oscillation behavior for neutrinos with different helicity, in particular there is a new resonant effect related to the helicity state of neutrino different than the usual MSW effect. For Majorana neutrinos, chiral oscillation also depends on Majorana phases.</p>

<p>In this paper, the structure of a dark matter halo can be well described by the mass model of M87 and the Einasto profile for the cold dark matter model, i.e., $\rho_{\text{halo}} (r)=\rho_e \exp ( -2 \alpha ^{-1} ((r/r_e)^\alpha -1 ) )$ [J. Wang et al., Nature, 585, 39-42 (2020)]. Under these conditions, we construct a solution of a static spherically symmetric black hole in a dark matter halo. Then, using the Newman-janis algorithm, we extend this static solution to the case of rotation, and obtain a solution for the Kerr-like black hole. We prove that this solution of the Kerr-like black hole is indeed a solution to the Einstein field equations. Finally, taking M87 as an example, we study and analyze some physical properties of this Kerr-like black hole, and then compare them with the Kerr black hole. These research results for the black hole in a dark matter halo may indirectly provide an effective method for detecting the existence of dark matter.</p>

<p>Using data from TNG300-2, we train a neural network (NN) to recreate the stellar mass ($M^<em>$) and star formation rate (SFR) of central galaxies in a dark-matter-only simulation. We consider 12 input properties from the halo and sub-halo hosting the galaxy and the near environment. $M^</em>$ predictions are robust, but the machine does not fully reproduce its scatter. The same happens for SFR, but the predictions are not as good as for $M^*$. We chained neural networks, improving the predictions on SFR to some extent. For SFR, we time-averaged this value between $z=0$ and $z=0.1$, which improved results for $z=0$. Predictions of both variables have trouble reproducing values at lower and higher ends. We also study the impact of each input variable in the performance of the predictions using a leave-one-covariate-out approach, which led to insights about the physical and statistical relation between input variables. In terms of metrics, our machine outperforms similar studies, but the main discoveries in this work are not linked with the quality of the predictions themselves, but to how the predictions relate to the input variables. We find that previously studied relations between physical variables are meaningful to the machine. We also find that some merger tree properties strongly impact the performance of the machine. %We highlight the value of machine learning (ML) methods in helping understand the information contained in different variables, since with its help we were able to obtain useful insights resulting from studying the impact of input variables on the resulting behaviour of galaxy properties. We conclude that ML models are useful tools to understand the significance of physical different properties and their impact on target characteristics, as well as strong candidates for potential simulation methods.</p>

<p>Horava gravity is a proposal for a UV completion of gravitation obtained by endowing the space-time manifold with a preferred foliation in space-like hypersurfaces. This allows for a power-counting renormalizable theory free of ghosts, at the cost of breaking local Lorentz invariance and diffeomorphism invariance down to foliation preserving transformations. In this updated review, we report the main successes and challenges of the proposal, discussing the main features of the projectable and non-projectable versions of Ho\v rava gravity. We focus in three main aspects: (i) the UV regime, discussing the renormalizability and renormalization group flow of the projectable theory, as well as the obstacles towards similar results in the non-projectable case; (ii) the low energy phenomenology of both models, including the PN regime, the most updated constraints in the parameter space of the theory, the structure of black holes at low energies, and the possibility of dark matter emerging from gravitational dynamics in the projectable model; and (iii) the specific phenomena induced by higher derivatives, such as the possibility of regularizing singularities, the dynamical behavior of solutions to dispersive equations, and the emission of Hawking radiation by universal horizons.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>Backsplash galaxies and their impact on galaxy evolution: a three-stage, four-type perspective</strong>, Andrés N. Ruiz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13037v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.13037v1</a></p>

<p>We study the population of backsplash galaxies at $z=0$ in the outskirts of massive, isolated clusters of galaxies taken from the MDPL2-SAG semi-analytic catalogue. We consider four types of backsplash galaxies according to whether they are forming stars or passive at three stagesin their lifetimes: before entering the cluster, during their first incursion through the cluster, and after they exit the cluster. We analyse several geometric, dynamic, and astrophysical aspects of the four types at the three stages. Galaxies that form stars at all stages account for the majority of the backsplash population ($58\%$) and have stellar masses typically below $M_\star\sim 3\times 10^{10} h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$ that avoid the innermost cluster’s regions and are only mildly affected by it. In a similar mass range, galaxies that become passive after exiting the cluster ($26\%$) follow orbits characterised by small pericentric distance and a strong deflection by the cluster potential well while suffering a strong loss of both dark matter and gas content. Only a small fraction of our sample ($4\%$) become passive while orbiting inside the cluster. These galaxies have experienced heavy pre-processing and the cluster’s tidal stripping and ram pressure provide the final blow to their star formation. Finally, galaxies that are passive before entering the cluster for the first time ($12\%$) are typically massive and are not affected significantly by the cluster. Using the bulge/total mass ratio as a proxy for morphology, we find that a single incursion through a cluster do not result in significant morphological changes in all four types.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>TOPSEM, TwO Parameters Semi Empirical Model: Galaxy Evolution and Bulge/Disk Dicothomy from Two-Stage Halo Accretion</strong>, Lumen Boco et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13036v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.13036v1</a></p>

<p>In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to semi empirical, data-driven models to tackle some aspects of the complex and still largely debated topic of galaxy formation and evolution. We here present a new semi empirical model whose marking feature is simplicity: it relies on solely two assumptions, one initial condition and two free parameters. Galaxies are connected to evolving dark matter haloes through abundance matching between specific halo accretion rate (sHAR) and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Quenching is treated separately, in a fully empirical way, to marginalize over quiescent galaxies and test our assumption on the sSFR evolution without contaminations from passive objects. Our flexible and transparent model is able to reproduce the observed stellar mass functions up to $z\sim 5$, giving support to our hypothesis of a monotonic relation between sHAR and sSFR. We then exploit the model to test a hypothesis on morphological evolution of galaxies. We attempt to explain the bulge/disk bimodality in terms of the two halo accretion modes: fast and slow accretion. Specifically, we speculate that bulge/spheroidal components might form during the early phase of fast halo growth, while disks form during the later phase of slow accretion. We find excellent agreement with both the observational bulge and elliptical mass functions.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>The MUSE-Faint survey. V. Constraining Scalar Field Dark Matter with Antlia B</strong>, Mariana P. Júlio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13035v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.13035v1</a></p>

<p>Aims. We use stellar line-of-sight velocities of Antlia B, a faint dwarf galaxy in the NGC 3109 association, to derive constraints on the fundamental properties of scalar field dark matter originally proposed to solve the small-scale problems faced by cold dark matter models. Methods. We use the first spectroscopic observations of Antlia B, a distant (d $\sim$ 1.35 Mpc) faint dwarf ($M_\text{V} = -9.7$, M$_\star \sim 8\times10^5$M$_\odot$), from MUSE-Faint - a survey of ultra-faint dwarfs with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer. Through measurement of line-of-sight velocities for stars in the $1’\times 1’$ field-of-view, we identify 127 stars as members of Antlia B, allowing us to model its dark matter density profile with the Jeans modelling code GravSphere. We implement a model for scalar field dark matter into GravSphere and use this to place constraints on the self-coupling strength of this model. Results. We find a virial mass of ${M_{200} \approx 1.66^{+2.51}_{-0.92}\times 10^9}$ M$_\odot$ and a concentration parameter of ${c_{200}\approx 17.38^{+6.06}_{-4.20}}$ for Antlia B. These results are consistent with the mass-concentration relations in the literature. We constrain the characteristic length scale of the repulsive self-interaction $R_{\text{TF}}$ of the scalar field dark matter model to $R_{\text{TF}} \lesssim 180$ pc (68% confidence level), which translates to a self-coupling strength of $\frac{g}{m^2c^4}\lesssim 5.2 \times 10^{-20}$ eV$^{-1}$cm$^3$. The constraint on the characteristic length scale of the repulsive self-interaction is inconsistent with the value required to match the observations of cores of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, suggesting that the cored density profiles of those galaxies are not caused by scalar field dark matter.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>Limits on dark matter annihilation in prompt cusps from the isotropic gamma-ray background</strong>, M. Sten Delos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13023v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.13023v1</a></p>

<p>Recent studies indicate that thermally produced dark matter will form highly concentrated, low-mass cusps in the early universe that often survive until the present. While these cusps contain a small fraction of the dark matter, their high density significantly increases the expected gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation, particularly in searches of large angular regions. We utilize 14 years of Fermi-LAT data to set strong constraints on dark matter annihilation through a detailed study of the isotropic gamma-ray background, excluding with 95% confidence dark matter annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ final states for dark matter masses below 120 GeV.</p>

<p>The Migdal effect predicts that a nuclear recoil interaction can be accompanied by atomic ionization, allowing many dark matter direct detection experiments to gain sensitivity to sub-GeV masses. We report the first direct search for the Migdal effect for M- and L-shell electrons in liquid xenon using 7.0$\pm$1.6 keV nuclear recoils produced by tagged neutron scatters. Despite an observed background rate lower than that of expected signals in the region of interest, we do not observe a signal consistent with predictions. We discuss possible explanations, including inaccurate predictions for either the Migdal rate or the signal response in liquid xenon. We comment on the implications for direct dark-matter searches and future Migdal characterization efforts.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>Influence of early dark matter halos on the primordial black holes merger rate</strong>, Viktor Stasenko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12924v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.12924v1</a></p>

<p>Primordial black hole (PBH) binaries forming in the early Universe may contribute to the merger events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. Moreover, the inferred merger rate constraints the fraction of PBH with masses $m \sim 10 \, M_{\odot}$ in the dark matter (DM) to $f_{PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$. This constraint assumes that after the formation of PBH binaries, they do not get destroyed or their parameters are not perturbed until the merger. However, PBHs themselves contribute to the formation of early DM structures in which the interactions between PBHs take place actively. This leads to the fact that the binaries can be perturbed in such a way that their lifetime becomes longer than the Hubble time $t_H$. In this work, we consider the effect of the initial spatial Poisson distribution of PBHs on the structure formation at the high redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$. Next, we explore the evolution of such halos due to the interaction of PBHs with each other and with DM particles. We show that the early halos evolve on timescales much shorter than the age of the Universe. Furthermore, for fractions of PBHs $f_{PBH} &lt; 1$, the internal dynamics of a halo is significantly accelerated due to the dynamical friction of PBHs against DM particles. As a result, a significant fraction of binaries will be perturbed in such structures, and the gravitational waves constraints on PBHs with masses $m \sim 10 \, M_{\odot}$ can be weakened to $f_{PBH} \sim 0.1$.</p>

<p>We present the design, control system, and noise analysis of a 6-axis seismometer comprising a mass suspended by a single fused silica fibre. We utilise custom-made, compact Michelson interferometers for the readout of the mass motion relative to the table and successfully overcome the sensitivity of existing commercial seismometers by over an order of magnitude in the angular degrees of freedom. We develop the sensor for gravitational-wave observatories, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, to help them observe intermediate-mass black holes, increase their duty cycle, and improve localisation of sources. Our control system and its achieved sensitivity makes the sensor suitable for other fundamental physics experiments, such as tests of semiclassical gravity, searches for bosonic dark matter, and studies of the Casimir force.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>Diurnal modulation of electron recoils from DM-nucleon scattering through the Migdal effect</strong>, Mai Qiao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12820v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.12820v1</a></p>

<p>Halo dark matter (DM) particles could lose energy due to the scattering off nuclei within the Earth before reaching the underground detectors of DM direct detection experiments. This Earth shielding effect can result in diurnal modulation of the DM-induced recoil event rates observed underground due to the self-rotation of the Earth. For electron recoil signals from DM-electron scatterings, the current experimental constraints are very stringent such that the diurnal modulation cannot be observed for halo DM. We propose a novel type of diurnal modulation effect: diurnal modulation in electron recoil signals induced by DM-nucleon scattering via the Migdal effect. We set so far the most stringent constraints on DM-nucleon scattering cross section via the Migdal effect for sub-GeV DM using the S2-only data of PandaX-II and PandaX-4T with improved simulations of the Earth shielding effect. Based on the updated constraints, we show that the Migdal effect induced diurnal modulation of electron events can still be significant in the low energy region, and can be probed by experiments such as PandaX-4T in the near future.</p>

<p>This study explores the implications of Dark Matter in Neutron Stars (DMANS) by focusing on two specific astronomical objects: HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607. Varying the Fermi momentum k$f^{\rm DM}$ of DM, the study analyzes the EOS for the INRS model with and without DM. Results show the robustness of the model, with most EOS curves within chiral Effective Field Theory bounds. Our model predicts a maximum mass of $2.343 \ M_\odot$ for PSR J0952-0607, satisfying NICER bounds. The analysis suggests HESS J1731-347 could be a DMANS. Constraints on DM within NSs are established, and tidal deformability lies within GW event limits. Nonradial $f$-mode oscillations increase with DM, concluding low mass stars pulsate at higher frequencies.</p>

<p>The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a satellite-borne detector designed to measure high energy cosmic-rays and $\gamma$-rays. As a key sub-detector of DAMPE, the Bismuth Germanium Oxide (BGO) imaging calorimeter is utilized to measure the particle energy with a high resolution. The nonlinear fluorescence response of BGO for large ionization energy deposition, known as the quenching effect, results in an under-estimate of the energy measurement for cosmic-ray nuclei. In this paper, various models are employed to characterize the BGO quenching factors obtained from the experimental data of DAMPE. Applying the proper quenching model in the detector simulation process, we investigate the tuned energy responses for various nuclei and compare the results based on two different simulation softwares, i.e. GEANT4 and FLUKA. The BGO quenching effect results in a decrease of the measured energy by approximately $2.5\%$ ($5.7 \%$) for carbon (iron) at $\sim$10 GeV/n and $&lt;1\%$ above 1 TeV/n, respectively. Accordingly, the correction of the BGO quenching effect leads to an increase of the low-energy flux measurement of cosmic-ray nuclei.</p>

<p>Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) provide a way to detect gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz frequencies. To ensure the detection of GWs, observational data must exhibit the Hellings-Downs angular correlation. It is also known that PTAs can probe ultralight dark matter. In this paper, we consider possible contamination of the Hellings-Downs angular correlation by the ultralight dark matter. We find that ultralight vector dark matter can give rise to the deformation of the Hellings-Downs correlation curve. Thus, the Hellings-Downs correlation curve could contain information on ultralight dark matter with a spin.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>Identifying the disc, bulge, and intra-halo light of simulated galaxies through structural decomposition</strong>, Katy L. Proctor et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12584v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.12584v1</a></p>

<p>We perform a structural decomposition of galaxies identified in three cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by applying Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to the kinematics of their stellar particles. We study the resulting disc, bulge, and intra-halo light (IHL) components of galaxies whose host dark matter haloes have virial masses in the range $M_{200}=10^{11}$– $10^{15}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. Our decomposition technique isolates galactic discs whose mass fractions, $f_{\rm disc}$, correlate strongly with common alternative morphology indicators; for example, $f_{\rm disc}$ is approximately equal to $\kappa_$, the fraction of stellar kinetic energy in co-rotation. The primary aim of our study, however, is to characterise the IHL of galaxies in a consistent manner and over a broad mass range, and to analyse its properties from the scale of galactic stellar haloes up to the intra-cluster light. Our results imply that the IHL fraction, $f_{\rm IHL}$, has appreciable scatter and is strongly correlated with galaxy morphology: at fixed stellar mass, the IHL of disc galaxies is typically older and less massive than that of spheroids. Above $M_{200}\approx 10^{13}\,{\rm M_\odot}$, we find, on average, $f_{\rm IHL}\approx 0.45$, albeit with considerable scatter. The transition radius beyond which the IHL dominates the stellar mass of a galaxy is roughly $30\,{\rm kpc}$ for $M_{200}\lesssim 10^{12.8}\,{\rm M_\odot}$, but increases strongly towards higher masses. However, we find that no alternative IHL definitions – whether based on the ex-situ stellar fraction, or the stellar mass outside a spherical aperture – reproduce our dynamically-defined IHL fractions.</p>

<p>Redshift measurements, primarily obtained from host galaxies, are essential for inferring cosmological parameters from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Matching SNe to host galaxies using images is non-trivial, resulting in a subset of SNe with mismatched hosts and thus incorrect redshifts. We evaluate the host galaxy mismatch rate and resulting biases on cosmological parameters from simulations modeled after the Dark Energy Survey 5-Year (DES-SN5YR) photometric sample. For both DES-SN5YR data and simulations, we employ the directional light radius method for host galaxy matching. In our SN Ia simulations, we find that 1.7% of SNe are matched to the wrong host galaxy, with redshift difference between the true and matched host of up to 0.6. Using our analysis pipeline, we determine the shift in the dark energy equation of state parameter (Dw) due to including SNe with incorrect host galaxy matches. For SN Ia-only simulations, we find Dw = 0.0013 +/- 0.0026 with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Including core-collapse SNe and peculiar SNe Ia in the simulation, we find that Dw ranges from 0.0009 to 0.0032 depending on the photometric classifier used. This bias is an order of magnitude smaller than the expected total uncertainty on w from the DES-SN5YR sample of around 0.03. We conclude that the bias on w from host galaxy mismatch is much smaller than the uncertainties expected from the DES-SN5YR sample, but we encourage further studies to reduce this bias through better host-matching algorithms or selection cuts.</p>

<p>The vast majority of Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) present in the Galaxy is formed by middle-aged systems characterized by a strong interaction of the PWN itself with the supernova remnant (SNR). Unfortunately, modelling these systems can be quite complex and numerically expensive, due to the non-linearity of the PWN-SNR evolution even in the simple 1D / one-zone case when the reverse shock of the SNR reaches the PWN, and the two begin to interact (and reverberation starts).   Here we introduce a new numerical technique that couples the numerical efficiency of the one-zone thin shell approach with the reliability of a full ``lagrangian’’ evolution, able to correctly reproduce the PWN-SNR interaction during the reverberation and to consistently evolve the particle spectrum beyond. Based on our previous findings, we show that our novel strategy resolves many of the uncertainties present in previous approaches, as the arbitrariness in the SNR structure, and ensure a robust evolution, compatible with results that can be obtained with more complex 1D dynamical approaches. Our approach enable us for the first time to provide reliable spectral models of the later compression phases in the evolution of PWNe. While in general we found that the compression is less extreme than that obtained without such detailed dynamical considerations, leading to the formation of less structured spectral energy distributions, we still find that a non negligible fraction of PWNe might experience a super-efficient phase, with the optical and/or X-ray luminosity exceeding the spin-down one.</p>

<p>2023-07-25, <strong>Cosmographic view on the $H_0$ and $σ_8$ tensions</strong>, Rocco D’Agostino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13464v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.13464v1</a></p>

<p>Measurements of the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ parameters within the standard cosmological model recently highlighted significant statistical tensions between the cosmic microwave background and low-redshift probes, such as local distance ladder, weak lensing and galaxy clustering surveys. In this work, we frame geometrical distances in a model-independent way by means of cosmographic approximations in the range $z \in (0, 2.3)$ to take into account a robust dataset composed of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), type Ia Supernovae (SN), Cosmic Chronometer (CC) data, and measurements from Redshift Space Distortions (RSD). From the joint analysis BAO\,+\,SN\,+\,CC\,+\,RSD, we find an accuracy of $\sim$1.4\% and $\sim$3.7\% on $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$, respectively. Our result for $H_0$ is at 2$\sigma$ tension with local measurements by the SH0ES team, while our $\sigma_8$ estimate is at 2.6$\sigma$ tension with Planck-CMB analysis. This inference shows a tension statistically smaller when compared to those estimated via the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also find that the jerk parameter can deviate more than 3$\sigma$ from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction. Under the same cosmographic setup, we also present results by considering a SH0ES Gaussian prior on $H_0$ that allows for improved accuracy of the parameter space of the models. The present work brings observational constraints on $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ into a new model-independent perspective, which differs from the predictions obtained within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</p>

<p>Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, including extended objects such as supernova remnants (SNRs) and Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe). Its turbulent characteristics govern the diffusion of cosmic rays and the multi-wavelength emission from PWNe. However, the geometry and turbulence nature of the magnetic fields in the ambient region of PWN is still unknown. Recent gamma-ray observations from HAWC and synchrotron observations suggest a highly suppressed diffusion coefficient compared to the mean interstellar value. In this letter, we present the first direct observational evidence that the local mean magnetic field is nearly aligned toward the line of sight (LoS) with an inclination angle $\theta_{\lambda} &lt;10^{\circ}$ employing a recently developed statistical recipe known as `Y-parameter’. Furthermore, we report that the magnetic field fluctuations are mostly dominated by compressible modes, with a 2D correlation length of approximately $3 \ {\rm pc}$ in the vicinity of Monogem PWN region. Our study highlights the pivotal role of magnetic field and turbulence in unraveling the physical processes in TeV halos and cosmic ray transport.</p>

<p>The cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a unique window into the early universe, providing insights into cosmological parameters like the Hubble constant. Recent precise measurements of the CMB by experiments like Planck seem to point to a lower value for the Hubble constant compared to some other measurements like those from Type Ia supernovae. This discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, currently lacks a definitive explanation. In this chapter, we provide an overview of how the Hubble constant is determined from detailed measurements of the CMB power spectrum. We explain the physics underlying key features of the CMB spectrum and their connection to cosmological parameters. We then examine the consistency of Planck’s Hubble constant determination, both internally within the data itself and externally with other astrophysical probes. While largely consistent, some anomalies like the lensing amplitude parameter $A_L$ remain unresolved. We also explore various theoretical extensions to the standard ${\Lambda}$CDM cosmological model and assess their potential to resolve the Hubble tension. No clear resolution emerges, indicating significant tensions remain between early and late universe probes within simple extensions to ${\Lambda}$CDM. Upcoming CMB experiments promise improved precision and should provide further insights into this cosmic conundrum. A coherent picture bridging measurements across cosmic time remains an open challenge at the forefront of modern cosmology.</p>

<p>2023-07-24, <strong>Lensed type Ia supernovae in light of SN Zwicky and iPTF16geu</strong>, Ana Sainz de Murieta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12881v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.12881v2</a></p>

<p>Strong gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are a powerful probe to obtain a measure of the expansion rate of the Universe, but they are also extremely rare. To date, only two glSNe with multiple images strongly lensed by galaxies have been found, but their short time delays make them unsuitable for cosmography. We simulate a realistic catalogue of lensed supernovae and study the characteristics of the population of detectable systems for different surveys. Our simulations show that the properties of glSNe in shallow surveys (such as the Zwicky Transient Facility; ZTF) are determined by the need for large magnifications, which favours systems of four images with short time delays and low image separations. This picture is consistent with the properties of iPTF16geu and SN~Zwicky, but is not representative of the population found in deeper surveys, which are limited by the volume of the Universe that is strongly lensed. In our simulations of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), glSNe show longer time delays and greater angular separations. Of these systems in LSST, 35\% will allow for time-delay measurements with a precision of 10\% or better. In the 10 years of the survey LSST should be able to find $\approx$ 180 systems, of which 60 will be suited for cosmography enabling a $\approx 1.5 \%$ precision $H_0$ measurement with LSST glSNe.</p>
