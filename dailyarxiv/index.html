<p>2024-07-02, <strong>Neutrinos with refractive masses and the DESI BAO results</strong>, Manibrata Sen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02462v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.02462v1</a></p>

<p>Due to interactions with dark matter, neutrinos can acquire refractive masses which explain the data from oscillation experiments. We study the effects of relic neutrinos with refractive masses on structure formation in the Universe. In the model with a light fermionic mediator, above the resonance energy, $E_R$, associated with the mass of the mediator, refractive masses have all the properties identical to the usual vacuum masses. Below the resonance, refractive masses decrease with neutrino energy, however, they cannot be used in the same way as usual masses. We study the dispersion relations and group velocities of such neutrinos and their dependence on redshift. We show that in the epoch of structure formation, relic neutrinos were ultrarelativistic and essentially massless particles for $E_R = (10 - 10^5)\,$eV. This allows to reconcile the values of masses extracted from oscillation experiments with the stringent bounds on sum of neutrino masses from cosmological surveys.</p>

<p>2024-07-02, <strong>Dark symmetry implication for right-handed neutrinos</strong>, Phung Van Dong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02324v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.02324v1</a></p>

<p>We argue that the long-standing issues of neutrino mass and dark matter can be manifestly solved in a dark gauge symmetry $U(1)_D$ that transforms nontrivially only for three right-handed neutrinos $\nu_{1,2,3R}$ – the counterparts of known left-handed neutrinos. This theory assigns $\nu_{1,2,3R}$ dark charge to be $D=0$, $-1$, and $+1$, respectively, in order for anomaly cancelation. Additionally, it imposes an inert Higgs doublet $\eta$ and two Higgs singlets $\xi,\phi$ with dark charge $D=+1$, $-1$, and $+2$, respectively. That said, the dark symmetry is broken by $\phi$ (by two units) down to a dark parity $P_D=(-1)^D$, for which $\nu_{2,3R}$ and $\eta,\xi$ are odd, whereas all other fields are even due to $D=0$. The lightest of these odd fields is stabilized by $P_D$, responsible for dark matter. Neutrino masses are generated by a scotoseesaw scheme, in which the seesaw part is mediated by $\nu_{1R}$, while the scotogenic part is mediated by $\nu_{2,3R}$, for which the hierarchy of atmospheric and solar neutrino mass splittings is explained.</p>

<p>2024-07-02, <strong>Systematics in ETG Mass Profile Modelling: Strong Lensing &amp; Stellar Dynamics</strong>, Carlos R. Melo-Carneiro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02297v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.02297v1</a></p>

<p>Strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics are independent and powerful methods to probe the total gravitational potential of galaxies, and thus, their total mass profile. However, inherent degeneracies in the individual models makes it difficult to obtain a full understanding of the distribution of baryons and dark matter (DM), although such degeneracies might be broken by the combination of these two tracers, leading to more reliable measurements of the mass distribution of the lens galaxy. We use mock data from IllustrisTNG50 to compare how dynamical-only, lens-only, and joint modelling can constrain the mass distribution of early-type galaxies (ETGs). The joint model consistently outperforms the other models, achivieng a $2\%$ accuracy in recovering the total mass within $2.5R_\text{eff}$. The Einstein radius is robustly recovered for both lens-only and joint models, with the first showing a median fractional error of $-5\%$ and the latter a fractional error consistent with zero. The stellar mass-to-light ratio and total mass density slope are well recovered by all models. In particular, the dynamical-only model achieves an accuracy of $1\%$ for the stellar mass-to-light ratio, while the accuracy of the mass density slope is typically of the order of $5\%$ for all models. However, all models struggle to constrain integrated quantities involving DM and the halo parameters. Nevertheless, imposing more restrictive assumptions on the DM halo, such as fixing the scale radius, could alleviate some of the issues. Finally, we verify that the number of kinematical constraints ($15, 35, 55$ bins) on the kinematical map does not impact the models outcomes.</p>

<p>2024-07-02, <strong>Conversations in the dark: cross-correlating birefringence and LSS to constrain axions</strong>, S. Arcari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02144v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.02144v1</a></p>

<p>Unveiling the dark sector of the Universe is one of the leading efforts in theoretical physics. Among the many models proposed, axions and axion-like particles stand out due to their solid theoretical foundation, capacity to contribute significantly to both dark matter and dark energy, and potential to address the small-scale crisis of $\Lambda$CDM. Moreover, these pseudo-scalar fields couple to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons parity-violating term, leading to a rotation of the plane of linearly polarized waves, namely cosmic birefringence. We explore the impact of the axion-parameters on anisotropic birefringence and study, for the first time, its cross-correlation with the spatial distribution of galaxies, focusing on ultralight axions with masses $10^{-33}\,{\rm eV}\le m_\phi\le10^{-28}\,{\rm eV}$. Through this novel approach, we investigate the axion-parameter space in the mass $m_\phi$ and initial misalignment angle $\theta_i$, within the framework of early dark energy models, and constrain the axion-photon coupling $g_{\phi\gamma}$ required to achieve unity in the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying cross-correlation, computed with the instrument specifications of Euclid and forthcoming CMB-polarization data. Our findings reveal that for masses below $10^{-32}\,{\rm eV}$ and initial misalignment angles greater in absolute value than $\pi/4$, the signal-to-noise ratio not only exceeds unity but also surpasses that achievable from the auto-correlation of birefringence alone (up to a factor 7), highlighting the informative potential of this new probe. Additionally, given the late-time evolution of these low-mass axions, the signal stems from the epoch of reionization, providing an excellent tool to single out the birefringence generated during this period.</p>

<p>2024-07-02, <strong>The interface of gravity and dark energy</strong>, Kristen Lackeos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02044v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.02044v1</a></p>

<p>At sufficiently large radii dark energy modifies the behavior of (a) bound orbits around a galaxy and (b) virialized gas in a cluster of galaxies. Dark energy also provides a natural cutoff to a cluster’s dark matter halo. In (a) there exists a maximum circular orbit beyond which periodic motion is no longer possible, and orbital evolution near critical binding is analytically calculable using an adiabatic invariant integral. The finding implicates the study of wide galaxy pairs. In (b), dark energy necessitates the use of a generalized Virial Theorem to describe gas at the outskirts of a cluster. When coupled to the baryonic escape condition, aided by dark energy, the results is a radius beyond which the continued establishment of a hydrostatic halo of thermalized baryons is untenable. This leads to a theoretically motivated virial radius. We use this theory to probe the structure of a cluster’s baryonic halo and apply it to X-ray and weak-lensing data collected on cluster Abell 1835. We find that gas in its outskirts deviates significantly from hydrostatic equilibrium beginning at $\sim 1.3\ {\rm Mpc}$, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inner' virial radius. We also define a model dependent dark matter halo cutoff radius to A1835. The dark matter cutoff gives an upper limit to the cluster's total mass of $\sim7\times 10^{15}M\_{\odot}$. Moreover, it is possible to derive an </code>outer’ hydrostatic equilibrium cutoff radius given a dark matter cutoff radius. A region of cluster gas transport and turbulence occurs between the inner and outer cutoff radii.</p>

<p>2024-07-02, <strong>Cubic Galileon Gravity in the CMB</strong>, Gen Ye et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02471v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.02471v1</a></p>

<p>Among the models addressing the Hubble tension, those introducing a dynamical dark component around recombination have been the most promising thus far. Their study has highlighted that, in fact, cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observations can allow for such components before and near recombination.   The new dynamical degree of freedom can be early dark energy (EDE) or early modified gravity depending on its coupling to gravity. We study a new model, $\mathcal{G}$EDE, featuring the cubic Galileon operator $X\Box\phi$ and test it against the most recent Planck PR4 CMB and Cepheid calibrated Pantheon+ type Ia Supernovae data. Thanks to the kinetic braiding effects, $\mathcal{G}$EDE gives a better fit to the data, with a higher $H_0$, and is preferred over the canonical EDE with a Bayes factor $\ln B=0.9$, despite introducing one more parameter. This calls for further explorations of modified gravity near and before last scattering. To facilitate these, we introduce a substantial extension of the cosmological code \texttt{EFTCAMB} that allows to fully evolve the background and linear dynamics of any covariant theory, oscillatory or not, belonging to the Horndeski class.</p>

<p>2024-07-02, <strong>A new bump in the night: evidence of a new feature in the binary black hole mass distribution at $70~M_{\odot}$ from gravitational-wave observations</strong>, Ignacio Magaña Hernandez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02460v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.02460v1</a></p>

<p>We analyze the confident binary black hole (BBH) detections from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) with an alternative mass population model in order to capture features in the mass distribution beyond the Powerlaw + Peak model. We find that the peak of a second power law characterizes the $\sim 30-35~ M_\odot$ bump, such that the data marginally prefers a mixture of two power laws for the mass distribution of binary components over a Powerlaw + Peak model with a Bayes Factor $\log_{10}\mathcal{B}$ of 0.1. This result may imply that the $\sim 30-35~ M_\odot$ feature represents the onset of a second population of BBH mergers (e.g. from a dynamical formation channel) rather than a specific mass feature over a broader distribution. When an additional Gaussian bump is allowed within our power law mixture model, we find a new feature in the BH mass spectrum at $\sim65-70~M_\odot$. This new feature may be consistent with hierarchical mergers, and constitute $\sim2\%$ of the BBH population. This model also recovers a maximum mass of $58^{+30}_{-14}~M_\odot$ for the second power law, consistent with the onset of a pair-instability supernova mass gap.</p>

<p>2024-07-02, <strong>Extended Uncertainty Principle: A Deeper Insight into the Hubble Tension?</strong>, Kourosh Nozari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01961v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.01961v1</a></p>

<p>The standard cosmological model, known as the LambdaCDM model, has been successful in many respects, but it has some significant discrepancies, some of which have not been resolved yet. In measuring the Hubble-Lematre parameter, there is an apparent discrepancy which is known as the Hubble tension, defined as differences in values of this parameter measured by the Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) data (a model-independent method) and by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation maps (a model-dependent method). Although many potential solutions have been proposed, the issue still remains unresolved. Recently, it was observed that the Hubble tension can be due to the concept of uncertainty in measuring cosmological parameters at large distance scales through applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) in cosmological setups. Extending this pioneering idea, in the present study we plan to incorporate the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) containing a minimal fundamental measurable momentum (or equivalently, a maximal fundamental measurable length) as a candidate setup for describing large-scale effects of Quantum Gravity (QG) to address the Hubble tension and constrain the EUP length scale. In this regard, by finding a relevant formula for the effective photon rest mass in terms of the present-time value of the Hubble-Lematre parameter, we see that discrepancies in the value of photon rest mass associated with the Hubble-Lematre parameter values estimated from model-independent and model-dependent methods perhaps is the cause of Hubble tension.</p>
