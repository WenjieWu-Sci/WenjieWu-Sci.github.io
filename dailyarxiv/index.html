<p>2024-07-08, <strong>Unveiling Neutrino Masses: Insights from Robust (e)BOSS Data Analysis and Prospects for DESI and Beyond</strong>, Hernan E. Noriega et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06117v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.06117v1</a></p>

<p>Recent findings from DESI BAO, combined with Planck CMB data, have set an upper limit on the total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.072 \, \text{eV}$ (95% confidence level). This rules out the minimum sum for the inverted hierarchy, and interestingly, the most likely value for the total neutrino mass is actually zero. Indeed, methods that rely on the background expansion of the Universe tend to suggest negative neutrino masses. In this work, we contribute to the quest for accurately constraining neutrino mass using cosmological probes. By conducting a full-shape analysis of data from BOSS, eBOSS, and synthetic power spectra, we discovered that constraints on neutrino mass can be significantly influenced by projection effects from the Bayesian marginalization process, rendering these constraints largely unreliable. Our results highlight the need for better techniques to accurately measure the neutrino mass. Based on the large-scale structure suppression, we identified a critical blind spot in the full-shape analysis. By splitting the galaxy power spectrum into broadband and wiggles, we noticed that information on neutrino mass is primarily extracted from the suppressed wiggles rather than broadband suppression. This opens the possibility of developing alternative methods based only on the wiggles of the power spectrum that can be more robust compared to those heavily reliant on background evolution.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>Combining Hybrid and Opaque Scintillator Techniques in Search for Double Beta Plus Decays</strong>, NuDoubt++ Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05999v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05999v1</a></p>

<p>Double beta plus decay is a rare nuclear disintegration process. Difficulties in its measurement arise from suppressed decay probabilities, experimentally challenging decay signatures and low natural abundances of suitable candidate nuclei. In this article, we propose a new detector concept to overcome these challenges. It is based on the first-time combination of hybrid and opaque scintillation detector technology paired with novel light read-out techniques. This approach is particularly suitable detecting positrons (beta plus) signatures. We expect to discover two-neutrino double beta plus decay modes within 1 tonne-week exposure and are able to probe neutrinoless double beta plus decays at several orders of magnitude improved significance compared to current experimental limits.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>Extraction of fissile isotope antineutrino spectra using feedforward neural network</strong>, Jian Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05834v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05834v1</a></p>

<p>Precise measurement of antineutrino spectra produced by isotope fission in reactors is of great significance for studying neutrino oscillations, refining nuclear databases, and addressing the reactor antineutrino anomaly. This work reports a method utilizing a feedforward neural network (FNN) model to decompose the reconstructed measured prompt energy spectrum observed by a short-baseline reactor neutrino experiment and extract the antineutrino spectra produced by the fission of major isotopes such as $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U, $^{239}$Pu, and $^{241}$Pu in a nuclear reactor. We present two training strategies for this model and compare them with the traditional $\chi^2$ minimization method, analyzing the same set of pseudo-data for a total exposure of $(2.9\times 5\times 1800)~\rm{GW_{th}\cdot tons\cdot days}$. The results show that the FNN model not only converges faster and better during the fitting process but also achieves relative errors in the extracted spectra within 1\% in the $2-8$ MeV range, outperforming the $\chi^2$ minimization method. The feasibility and superiority of this method have been validated in this study.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>Revisiting for maximal flavor violating $Z^{â}_{eÎ¼}$ and its phenomenology constraints</strong>, Jia Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05831v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05831v1</a></p>

<p>Lepton flavor violation (LFV), observed conclusively in neutrino oscillations, remains a pivotal area of investigation due to its absence in the Standard Model (SM). Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics explores charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), particularly through new particle candidates such as the $Z^{â}$. This article focuses on maximal LFV interactions facilitated by the $Z^{â}$ boson, specifically targeting its off-diagonal interactions with the first and second generations of charged and neutral leptons. In our ultraviolet (UV) model for the origin of the $Z^{â}$, inspired by the work of [R.Foot \textit{et al.,}~arxiv:hep-ph/9401250], we utilize the discrete $Z_2$ symmetry to investigate the maximal LFV mediated by the $Z^{â}$ between the muon ($\mu$) and electron ($e$) arising from the additional scalars. This symmetry prohibits flavor-conserving interactions between $Zâ$ and $\mu^+\mu^-,\, e^+e^-$. In conjunction with collider, $(g-2)_{\mu}, (g-2)_e$, inverse $\mu$ decay and LFV decay constraints, we provide forecasts for anticipated limits derived from processes such as $\nu_\mu N \to \nu_e \mu^+ e^- N$ in neutrino trident experiments like the DUNE experiment. These limits highlight the prospective scope and significance of LFV investigations within these experimental frameworks. From the range of mass between 0.01 GeV and 10 GeV, the most stringent limit arise from $ \textit{B} (\mu \to e + X +\gamma)$ for $M_{Z^{â}} &lt; m_\mu$ while neutrino trident processes constrain effectively as $M_{Z^{â}} \to 10$ GeV.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>DarkSide-20k sensitivity to light dark matter particles</strong>, DarkSide-20k Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05813v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05813v1</a></p>

<p>The dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber is presently one of the leading technologies to search for dark matter particles with masses below 10 GeV/c$^2$. This was demonstrated by the DarkSide-50 experiment with approximately 50 kg of low-radioactivity liquid argon as target material. The next generation experiment DarkSide-20k, currently under construction, will use 1,000 times more argon and is expected to start operation in 2027. Based on the DarkSide-50 experience, here we assess the DarkSide-20k sensitivity to models predicting light dark matter particles, including Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and sub-GeV/c$^2$ particles interacting with electrons in argon atoms. With one year of data, a sensitivity improvement to dark matter interaction cross-sections by at least one order of magnitude with respect to DarkSide-50 is expected for all these models. A sensitivity to WIMPânucleon interaction cross-sections below $1\times10^{-42}$ cm$^2$ is achievable for WIMP masses above 800 MeV/c$^2$. With 10 years exposure, the neutrino fog can be reached for WIMP masses around 5 GeV/c$^2$.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>T violation at a future neutrino factory</strong>, Ryuichiro Kitano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05807v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05807v1</a></p>

<p>We study the possibility of measuring T (time reversal) violation in a future long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. By assuming a neutrino factory as a staging scenario of a muon collider at the J-PARC site, we find that the ${\nu}_e \to {\nu}_{\mu}$ oscillation probabilities can be measured with a good accuracy at the Hyper-Kamiokande detector. By comparing with the probability of the time-reversal process, ${\nu}_{\mu} \to {\nu}_e$, measured at the T2K/T2HK experiments, one can determine the CP phase $\delta$ in the neutrino mixing matrix if $| \sin(\delta)|$ is large enough. The determination of $\delta$ can be made with poor knowledge of the matter density of the earth as T violation is almost insensitive to the matter effects. The comparison of CP and T-violation measurements, ${\it `a\ la}$ the CPT theorem, provides us with a non-trivial check of the three neutrino paradigm based on the quantum field theory.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>Relic Abundance of Dark Matter with $Î$(54) Flavor Symmetry</strong>, Hrishi Bora et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05753v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05753v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we discuss the neutrino phenomenology in a $\Delta(54)$ discrete flavor symmetry and evaluate the relic abundance of dark matter (DM) and active neutrino-DM mixing angle considering various cosmological constraints. We introduced two Standard Model Higgs particles along with vector-like fermions and a new particle (S) which is a gauge singlet in the Standard Model. This modification leads to a mass matrix that diverges from the tribimaximal neutrino mixing pattern resulting in a non-zero reactor angle ($\theta_{13}$). We also incorporated a $ Z_2 \otimes Z_3 \otimes Z_4$ symmetry for the specific interactions in our model. The additional particle S is a sterile neutrino which is considered to be a probable dark matter candidate with mass in keV range.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>Dark Sector Tunneling Field Potentials for a Dark Big Bang</strong>, Richard Casey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05752v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05752v1</a></p>

<p>All of the significant evidence for dark matter observed thus far has been through its gravitational interactions. After 40 years of direct detection experiments, the parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) as dark matter candidates is rapidly approaching the neutrino floor. In this light, we consider a dark sector that is strongly decoupled from the visible sector, interacting exclusively through gravity. In this model, proposed by Freese and Winkler (arXiv:2302.11579), dark matter can be produced through a first-order phase transition in the dark sector dubbed the Dark Big Bang. In this study we fully determine the allowed region of parameter space for the tunneling potential that leads to the realization of a Dark Big Bang and is consistent with all experimental bounds available.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>Transition magnetic moment about neutrinos</strong>, Long Ruan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05741v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05741v1</a></p>

<p>This paper investigates the neutrino transition magnetic moment in the $U(1)_X$SSM. $U(1)_X$SSM is the $U(1)$ extension of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and its local gauge group is extended to $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_X$. To obtain this model, three singlet new Higgs superfields and right-handed neutrinos are added to the MSSM, which can explain the results of neutrino oscillation experiments. The neutrino transition magnetic moment is induced by electroweak radiative corrections. By applying effective Lagrangian method and on-shell scheme, we study the associated Feynman diagrams and the transition magnetic moment of neutrinos in the model. We fit experimental data for neutrino mass variances and mixing angle. Based on the range of data selection, the influences of different sensitive parameters on the results are analysed. The numerical analysis shows that many parameters have an effect on the neutrino transition moment, such as $g_X$, $M_2$, $\lambda_H$ and $g_{YX}$. For our numerical results, the order of magnitude of $\mu_{ij}$ is between $10^{-20}$ and $10^{-19}$.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>Resonant leptogenesis in minimal $U(1)_X$ extensions of the Standard Model</strong>, Arindam Das et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05644v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05644v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a general $U(1)_X$ scenario where we introduce three generations of Standard Model (SM) singlet Right Handed Neutrinos (RHNs) to generate the light neutrino mass through the seesaw mechanism after the breaking of $U(1)_X$ and electroweak symmetries. In addition to that, a general $U(1)_X$ scenario involves an SM-singlet scalar field and due to the $U(1)_X$ symmetry breaking the mass of a neutral beyond the SM (BSM) gauge boson $Z^\prime$ is evolved. The RHNs, being charged under $U(1)_X$ scenario, can explain the origin of observed baryon asymmetry through the resonant leptogenesis process. Applying observed neutrino oscillation data we study $Z^\prime$ and BSM scalar induced processes to reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry. Hence we estimate bounds on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and the mass of the $Z^\prime$ $(M_{Z^\prime})$ for different $U(1)_X$ charges and benchmark masses of RHN and SM-singlet scalar. Finally we compare our results with limits obtained from the existing limits from LEP-II and LHC. We find that depending on the $U(1)_X$ charges, the masses of RHNs and SM-singlet scalar resonant leptogenesis could provide stronger limit on $g_X$ for $M_{Z^\prime} &gt; 5.8$ TeV which could be probed by high energy scattering experiment in future.</p>

<p>2024-07-07, <strong>Connecting pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter with pseudo-Dirac neutrinos in a left-right symmetry model</strong>, Sumit Biswas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05482v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05482v1</a></p>

<p>Stringent constraints from the dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments can be naturally evaded for a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) DM. We propose a realization of pNGB DM in the context of a left-right symmetric model, wherein the neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac in nature. The Dirac mass term for neutrinos arises from two-loop quantum corrections, whereas the Majorana mass terms are generated from Planck-induced corrections. This class of model also provides a parity solution to the strong CP problem without the need for an axion. We show an interesting correlation between the lifetime of the DM and the mass-squared differences between active and sterile neutrinos while maintaining a solution to the strong CP problem.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>The accreted stellar haloes of Milky Way-mass galaxies as a probe of the nature of the dark matter</strong>, Victor J. Forouhar Moreno et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05899v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05899v1</a></p>

<p>Galactic stellar haloes are largely composed of the remnants of galaxies accreted during the assembly of their host galaxies, and hence their properties reflect the mass spectrum and post-accretion evolution of their satellites. As the nature of dark matter (DM) can affect both, we explore how the properties of the accreted stellar component vary across cold (CDM), warm (WDM) and self-interacting (SIDM) models. We do this by studying accreted stellar populations around eight MW-mass haloes using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations based on the EAGLE galaxy formation model, in which we find that the accreted stellar mass remains similar across models. Contrary to WDM, which only presents minor differences relative to CDM, the distribution of accreted stars in SIDM changes significantly within $0.05R_{200}$ ($10\,\mathrm{kpc}$). The central density reduces to $\langle \rho^{\mathrm{SIDM}}_{\mathrm{exsitu}} / \rho^{\mathrm{CDM}}_{\mathrm{exsitu}} \rangle = 0.3$ and has a shallower radial dependence, with logarithmic density slopes of $\langle \alpha_{\mathrm{SIDM}} \rangle = -1.4$ vs $\langle \alpha_{\mathrm{CDM}} \rangle = -1.7$. Additionally, stars are on more tangential orbits than their CDM counterparts, with a change in the velocity anisotropy of $\langle \Delta \beta \rangle = - 0.2$. Finally, SIDM stellar haloes have the largest number and prominence of overdensities in radius vs radial velocity space. This is due to a combination of shorter stellar halo progenitor merging timescales and shallower host potentials, with the former resulting in less time for dynamical friction and radialisation to operate. In summary, we show that the phase-space structure of Galactic stellar haloes encode key information that can be used to distinguish and rule out different DM models.</p>

<p>2024-07-07, <strong>A natural explanation of the VPOS from multistate Scalar Field Dark Matter</strong>, Tula Bernal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05273v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05273v1</a></p>

<p>Observations with the Gaia satellite have confirmed that the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) are not distributed as homogeneously as expected. The same occurs in galaxies such as Andromeda and Centaurus A, where satellite galaxies around their host galaxies have been observed to have orbits aligned perpendicular to the galactic plane of the host galaxy. This problem is known as Vast Polar Structure (VPOS) for the MW. The Scalar Field Dark Matter Field (SFDM), also known as Ultralight-, Fuzzy-, BEC-, Axion-dark matter, proposes that DM is a scalar field (SF), which in the non-relativistic limit follows the Schr"odinger equation coupled to the Poisson equation. Although the SF here is classical, the Schr"odinger equation contains a ground and excited states as part of its nature. In this work, we show that such quantum character of the SFDM can naturally explain the VPOS observed in galaxies. By taking into account the finite temperature corrections for a complex, self-interacting SF at very early epochs of the Universe, we show that the resulting ground and first excited states only, we can fit the rotation curves of the galaxies in a very simple way, and with the best-fit parameters obtained, we can explain the VPOS. We do this with particular galaxies, such as the MW, M31, Centaurus A, and other six galaxies whose satellites have been observed. From this result, it follows that the multistate SFDM is not distributed homogeneously around the galaxy, and therefore might explain the anisotropic distribution of the satellite galaxies. According to this result, this could be a general characteristic of the galaxies in the Universe. Finally, we also show how the scale of each galaxy depends on a parameter that is determined by the final temperature of the SF of the galaxy halo under study. This explains why different galaxies with SFDM give different values of the mass of the SF.</p>

<p>2024-07-07, <strong>Quasinormal modes and greybody factor of Schwarzschild Black Hole in the Cold Dark Matter Halo</strong>, Shi-Jie Ma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05272v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05272v1</a></p>

<p>In this article, we firstly studied wave function in static spherically symmetric spacetime and obtained effective potential of perturbed fields with spin. Then we applied $6^{\rm{th}}$ order WKB approximation to analyze quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild black hole in the Cold Dark Matter halo in perturbed fields with different spins and derived quasinormal frequencies. Further, to study the relation between quasinormal frequencies and optics, we compare the results of WKB method with eikonal limit formula. At last, we discussed greybody factor in different perturbed fields under this spacetime.</p>

<p>Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a new class of transients with luminosities $\sim10 -100$ times larger than the usual core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Their origin is still unclear and one widely discussed scenario involves a millisecond magnetar central engine. The GeV-TeV emission of SLSNe has been predicted in the literature but has not been convincingly detected yet. Here we report the search for the $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of SN 2017egm, one of the closest SLSNe detected so far, with the 15-year {\it Fermi}-LAT Pass 8 data. There is a transient $\gamma$-ray source appearing about 2 months after this event and lasting a few months. Both the peak time and the luminosity of the GeV emission are consistent with the magnetar model prediction, suggesting that such a GeV transient is the high-energy counterpart of SN 2017egm and the central engine of this SLSNe is a young magnetar.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>Joint observations of late universe probes: cosmological parameter constraints from gravitational wave and Type Ia supernova data</strong>, Jie Zheng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05686v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05686v1</a></p>

<p>The growing tensions between the early Universe and the late Universe increasingly highlight the importance of developing precise probes for late cosmology. As significant late-Universe probes, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and gravitational waves (GWs) can provide measurements of relative and absolute distances, respectively. Their complementary nature is likely to break the degeneracies among cosmological parameters, thereby yielding more precise constraints. In this study, we use 43 gravitational-wave sources from the Third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) and 1590 SNe Ia from Pantheon+ compilation to constrain the dark energy models, as an attempt to achieve precise late-Universe cosmological constraints. For the dark siren GW event, we estimate the corresponding redshift using the binary black hole redshift distribution model. The combination of GW and SNe Ia data could provide the precision on the Hubble constant (H0) and the present matter density (Omega_m) of approximately 20% and 8% for the LambdaCDM model. If we consider the equation of state of dark energy (w), the combination sample constrains the precision of w to approximately 30%. Although the combination of GW and SNe Ia observations effectively breaks degeneracies among various cosmological parameters, yielding more stringent constraints, the precision of these constraints still does not meet the stringent standards required by precision cosmology. However, it is reasonable to anticipate that, in the near future, the joint observations of GWs and SNe Ia will become a powerful tool, particularly in the late Universe, for the precise measurement of cosmological parameters.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>Probing Dark Energy Evolution Post-DESI 2024</strong>, Lili Orchard et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05579v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05579v1</a></p>

<p>We study the evidence for dark energy (DE) evolution at low redshift, using baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs) from the DESI Early Data Release, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SNe-Ia), and redshift space distortions (RSDs) to constrain cosmological parameters. Furthermore, we make use of the angular acoustic scale to analyse the effect of introducing condensed CMB information on the cosmological parameters informing DE evolution. The analysis is divided into cases based on the variability of priors inferred from early-time physics. Using a quadratic parametrisation, $X(z)$, for DE density, we find evidence for DE evolution in all cases, both with and without the angular acoustic scale. We reconstruct $X(z)$ using best fit parameters and find that DE density starts to exhibit dynamical behaviour at $z \sim 0.5 $, assuming negative values beyond $z\sim 1.5$. The data show no significant preference for $X(z)$CDM over a $\Lambda$CDM, with both models performing equally well according to our chosen metrics of reduced $\chi^2$ and the Durbin-Watson statistic.</p>

<p>2024-07-08, <strong>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using Type Ia supernovae and radio quasars through model-independent methods</strong>, Fan Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05559v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.05559v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we perform a cosmological-model-independent test on the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the angular diameter distance (ADD) obtained from the compact radio quasars (QSOs) with the luminosity distance (LD) from the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) sample. The binning method and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are employed to match ADD data with LD data at the same redshift, and three different parameterizations are adopted to quantify the possible deviations from the CDDR. We initially investigate the impacts of the specific prior values for the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ from SNIa and the linear size scaling factor $l$ from QSOs on the CDDR test, demonstrating that these prior values introduce significant biases in the CDDR test. To avoid the biases, we propose a method independent of $M_{\rm B}$ and $l$ to test CDDR, which treats the fiducial value of a new variable $\kappa\equiv10^{M_{\rm B} \over 5}\,l$ as a nuisance parameter and then marginalize its impact with a flat prior in the statistical analysis. We demonstrate that the parametric method for testing CDDR can not only be used to reduce the computational complexity associated with numerical integration but also be independent of cosmological models. The results indicate that the CDDR is consistent with the observational data, and QSOs can serve as a powerful tool for testing the CDDR.</p>
