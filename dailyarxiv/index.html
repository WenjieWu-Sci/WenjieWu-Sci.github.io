<p>2025-05-29, <strong>Hybrid-Graph Neural Network Method for Muon Fast Reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes</strong>, Cen Mo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23425v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.23425v1</a></p>

<p>Fast and accurate muon reconstruction is crucial for neutrino telescopes to improve experimental sensitivity and enable online triggering. This paper introduces a Hybrid-Graph Neural Network (GNN) method tailored for efficient muon track reconstruction, leveraging the robustness of GNNs alongside traditional physics-based approaches. The “LITE GNN model” achieves a runtime of 0.19-0.29 ms per event on GPUs, offering a three orders of magnitude speedup compared to traditional likelihood-based methods while maintaining a high reconstruction accuracy. For high-energy muons (10-100 TeV), the median angular error is approximately 0.1 degrees, with errors in reconstructed Cherenkov photon emission positions being below 3-5 meters, depending on the GNN model used. Furthermore, the Semi-GNN method offers a mechanism to assess the quality of event reconstruction, enabling the identification and exclusion of poorly reconstructed events. These results establish the GNN-based approach as a promising solution for next-generation neutrino telescope data reconstruction.</p>

<p>2025-05-29, <strong>Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes in Theories with Extra Dimensions</strong>, Luis A. Anchordoqui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23414v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.23414v1</a></p>

<p>The quantum gravity scale within the dark dimension scenario ($M_* \sim 10^{9}~{\rm GeV}$) roughly coincides with the energy scale of the KM3-230213A neutrino ($E_\nu \sim 10^{8}~{\rm GeV}$). We propose an interpretation for this intriguing coincidence in terms of Hawking evaporation of five-dimensional (5D) primordial black holes (PBHs). 5D PBHs are bigger, colder, and longer-lived than 4D PBHs of the same mass. For brane observers, PBHs decay essentially invisibly (only through gravitationally coupled modes), with a possible hot (temperature $\sim 10^{8}~{\rm GeV}$) flare of Standard Model particles in the final-stage emission. As a consequence, constraints on the density of PBHs relative to that of dark matter from null searches of Hawking evaporation can be avoided. We show that Hawking evaporation of 5D PBHs can accommodate the KM3-230213A neutrino event and remain consistent with IceCube upper limits on the partial decay width of superheavy dark matter particles into neutrinos.</p>

<p>2025-05-29, <strong>Turbulence in Primordial Dark Matter Halos and Its Impact on the First Star Formation</strong>, Meng-Yuan Ho et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23768v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.23768v1</a></p>

<p>We present high-resolution simulations of the first star-forming clouds in 15 minihalos with masses ranging from $\sim 10^5$ to $10^7\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ at redshifts $z \sim 17 - 20$, using the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations incorporate detailed primordial gas physics and adopt initial conditions from the state-of-the-art TNG cosmological simulations. To achieve the required resolution, we apply a particle-splitting technique that increases the resolution of the original TNG data by a factor of $\sim 10^5$, reaching gas and dark matter particle masses of $0.2\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ and $80\ \text{M}_{\odot}$, respectively. This enables us to resolve gas accretion during the early assembly of minihalos and to capture the emergence of strong turbulent flows. We find that turbulence, driven by gas infall into the dark matter potential wells, is predominantly supersonic, with characteristic Mach numbers ranging from $1.8$ to $4.2$, increasing with halo mass. The supersonic turbulence effectively fragments the central gas cloud into multiple dense clumps, some of which form gravitationally bound cores and begin to collapse into the first stars. Our results suggest that supersonic turbulence is a common feature in minihalos and plays a key role in generating clumpy star-forming clouds, with important implications for the initial mass function of the first stars.</p>

<p>2025-05-29, <strong>Colloquium: The Cosmic Dipole Anomaly</strong>, Nathan Secrest et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23526v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.23526v1</a></p>

<p>The Cosmological Principle, which states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic (when averaged on large scales), is the foundational assumption of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies such as the current standard Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model. This simplification yields an exact solution to the Einstein field equations that relates space and time through a single time-dependent scale factor, which defines cosmological observables such as the Hubble parameter and the cosmological redshift. The validity of the Cosmological Principle, which underpins modern cosmology, can now be rigorously tested with the advent of large, nearly all-sky catalogs of radio galaxies and quasars. Surprisingly, the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is found to be inconsistent with the expectation from kinematic aberration and Doppler boosting effects in a perturbed FLRW universe, which is the standard interpretation of the observed dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although the matter dipole agrees in direction with that of the CMB dipole, it is anomalously larger, demonstrating that either the rest frames in which matter and radiation appear isotropic are not the same, or that there is an unexpected intrinsic anisotropy in at least one of them. This discrepancy now exceeds 5{\sigma} in significance. We review these recent findings, as well as the potential biases, systematic issues, and alternate interpretations that have been suggested to help alleviate the tension. We conclude that the cosmic dipole anomaly poses a serious challenge to FLRW cosmology, and the standard {\Lambda}CDM model in particular, as an adequate description of our Universe.</p>

<p>2025-05-29, <strong>Toward a simultaneous resolution of the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions: early dark energy and an interacting dark sector model</strong>, Mai Yashiki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23382v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.23382v1</a></p>

<p>The tension between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and that measured from late-time observations, such as the local distance ladder, is a major challenge in modern cosmology. Early dark energy (EDE) has been proposed as a possible resolution to the $H_0$ tension, but it typically worsens the $S_8$ tension by enhancing the small-scale matter power spectrum due to an increased cold dark matter density. To address this issue, we propose a model that combines EDE with an interacting dark energy-dark matter (iDEDM) scenario, and investigate whether this mixed model can simultaneously resolve both tensions. We find that the DE-DM interaction suppress the growth of structure and reduce $S_8$, while EDE contributes to increase $H_0$, although less effectively than in the EDE-only case. Our MCMC analysis using Planck 2018, DESI BAO, DES, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data shows that the mixed model provides modest improvements in both tensions, although it does not fully resolve either. This limitation appears to stem from the fact that both EDE and iDEDM independently favor a higher present-day matter density, which reduces the angular diameter distance and limits the degree to which EDE can lower the sound horizon.</p>

<p>2025-05-29, <strong>Compartmentalization in the Dark Sector of the Universe after DESI DR2 BAO data</strong>, Marcel van der Westhuizen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23306v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.23306v1</a></p>

<p>We consider a non-linear interaction between the dark matter and dark energy components of the universe. In particular, within the FLRW geometry, where dark matter is described by a dust fluid and dark energy by an ideal gas with a constant equation of state parameter, we introduce energy transfer between the two fluids. The effective cosmological fluid leads to a unified dynamical dark energy model with the feature that the Hubble function admits an analytic expression. We study this model using the DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations data and the Supernova data from Pantheon+. The interacting model fits the data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\chi_{\text{model}}^{2}-\chi_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}^{2}=-5$. Using the Akaike Information Criterion to compare the two models, we derive $\text{AIC}_{\operatorname{model}}-\text{AIC}_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}=-1$, from which we conclude that the interacting model is marginally better supported by the data than the $\Lambda$CDM, but the difference is not statistically significant.</p>

<p>2025-05-29, <strong>Dark clouds to silver linings over the hyperchargeless scalar triplets</strong>, Priyotosh Bandyopadhyay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23257v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.23257v1</a></p>

<p>A real scalar triplet with zero hypercharge offers a minimal non-trivial extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a charged Higgs and a possible dark matter or custodial symmetry breaking signature. The $Z_2$-odd inert triplet model (ITM) provides a dark matter, while the non-inert Higgs triplet model (HTM) breaks the custodial symmetry, enabling rich collider signatures. Both these models also promise the viability of a first-order phase transition (FOPT). This letter revisits both models under various theoretical and current experimental constraints, revealing a trade-off between DM and FOPT viability, and explores the resulting gravitational wave signals and collider prospects.</p>

<p>2025-05-29, <strong>The ambiguous AT2022rze: Changing-look AGN mimicking a supernova in a merging galaxy system</strong>, P. J. Pessi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23731v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.23731v1</a></p>

<p>AT2022rze is a luminous, ambiguous transient located South-East of the geometric center of its host galaxy at redshift z = 0.08. The host appears to be formed by a merging galaxy system. The observed characteristics of AT2022rze are reminiscent of active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events (TDEs), and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of -20.2 +- 0.2 mag, showing a sharp rise (trise,1/e = 27.5 +- 0.6 days) followed by a slow decline (tdec,1/e = 382.9 +- 0.6). Its bumpy light curve and narrow Balmer lines indicate the presence of gas (and dust). Its light curve shows rather red colors, indicating that the transient could be affected by significant host extinction. The spectra reveal coronal lines, indicative of high-energy (X-ray/UV) emission. Archival data reveal no prior activity at this location, disfavoring a steady-state AGN, although an optical spectrum obtained prior to the transient is consistent with an AGN classification of the host. Based on this, we conclude that the transient most likely represents a Changing-look AGN at the center of the smallest component of the merging system.</p>

<p>2025-05-29, <strong>An energy approach to pulsar-disc interaction: disc stability and implications for transitional millisecond pulsars</strong>, Eda Vurgun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23407v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.23407v1</a></p>

<p>The stability of an accretion disc surrounding a millisecond pulsar is analysed from an energetic point of view, using magnetohydrodynamic simulations that consider realistic disc structures and a variety of magnetic field inclination angles. The time-averaged components of the magnetic field interact with the disc through ohmic dissipation, which causes heating and partial evaporation of its innermost region. The stability of the disc right after the magnetic field is turned on is analysed as a function of the location of the inner radius of the disc and the magnetic inclination angle. Our results show that the disc is severely altered in those cases where its inner radius lies well beyond the light cylinder and the magnetic axis is not totally aligned with the neutron star spin axis. Overall, the results of the simulations agree with those obtained in previous works where analytical or semi-analytical energy models were also used to discuss the stability of the disc. The implications for the understanding of the transitional millisecond pulsars are discussed. We briefly mention implications of our results for low-mass X-ray binaries and supernova fallback discs.</p>

<p>2025-05-29, <strong>Effect of positronium on the $γ$-ray spectra and energy deposition in Type Ia supernovae</strong>, Anirban Dutta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22992v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.22992v1</a></p>

<p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are powered by the radioactive decay of isotopes such as $^{56}$Ni and $^{56}$Co, making their $\gamma$-ray spectra useful probes of the explosion mechanism and ejecta structure. Accurate interpretation of $\gamma$-ray observables, including line ratios and continuum fluxes, requires a detailed understanding of the microphysical processes that shape the spectra. One such process is positronium formation during electron-positron annihilation, which can redistribute flux from the 511 keV line into the surrounding continuum. To assess the impact of positronium on the emergent spectra, we developed a new open-source module TARDIS-HE, for time-dependent three-dimensional $\gamma$-ray transport, integrated into the radiative transfer code TARDIS. The code simulates $\gamma$-ray spectra and light curves from one-dimensional supernova ejecta models and allows for flexible incorporation of decay chains and opacity treatments. Using TARDIS-HE, we explore the effect of positronium formation by varying the positronium fraction from 0 % to 100 %, and assuming an extreme case where 75 % of positronium decays result in three-photon emission. We find that full positronium formation can reduce the 511 keV line flux by approximately 70 % and modestly enhance energy deposition by up to 2 % at around 100 days post-explosion, compared to models without positronium. These results demonstrate that while the effect is not dominant, positronium formation introduces measurable changes to $\gamma$-ray observables. Future observations with missions such as the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) may offer constraints on positronium formation in SNe Ia and help refine models of their radioactive energy transport.</p>
