<p>2024-05-30, <strong>Supermassive black holes and very high-energy neutrinos: the case of NGC 1068</strong>, P. Padovani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20146v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.20146v1</a></p>

<p>We present a comprehensive multi-messenger study of NGC 1068, the prototype Seyfert II galaxy recently associated with high-energy IceCube neutrinos. Various aspects of the source, including its nuclear activity, jet, outflow, and starburst region, are analyzed in detail using a multi-wavelength approach and relevant luminosities are derived. We then explore its gamma-ray and neutrino emissions and investigate potential mechanisms underlying these phenomena and their relations with the different astrophysical components to try to understand which one is responsible for the IceCube neutrinos. By first using simple order-of-magnitude arguments and then applying specific theoretical models, we infer that only the region close to the accretion disc around the supermassive black hole has both the right density of X-ray photons needed to provide the targets for protons to sustain neutrino production and of optical/infrared photons required to absorb the associated but unobserved gamma rays. We conclude by highlighting ongoing efforts to constrain a possible broad connection between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei, as well as future synergies between astronomical and neutrino facilities.</p>

<p>2024-05-30, <strong>Detailed nuclear structure calculations for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering</strong>, Raghda Abdel Khaleq et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20060v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.20060v1</a></p>

<p>Any discovery of `new physics’ in the neutrino sector first requires a precise prediction of the expected Standard Model cross section. Currently, Coherent Elastic neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) experiments are statistics limited. However, as new and future experiments scale up, it will be necessary to improve the theoretical predictions. Here we review the calculation of the CEvNS cross section in a consistent theory of hadronic currents and compute the relevant nuclear form factors using the nuclear shell model. The uncertainty on the form factors is explored by repeating the calculation for various shell model interactions and with Skyme-Hartree-Fock evaluations of the Weak-charge radii. We then refine the Standard Model predictions for the recent experimental results of the COHERENT experiment. We find that our cross sections are in good agreement with previous predictions, but with significantly smaller uncertainties - by up to a factor of 10. Near-future CEvNS experiments will meaningfully benefit from improved predictions through an increased sensitivity to new-physics signals.</p>

<p>2024-05-30, <strong>Refractive index in the JUNO liquid scintillator</strong>, H. S. Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19879v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19879v1</a></p>

<p>In the field of rare event physics, it is common to have huge masses of organic liquid scintillator as detection medium. In particular, they are widely used to study neutrino properties or astrophysical neutrinos. Thanks to its safety properties (such as low toxicity and high flash point) and easy scalability, linear alkyl benzene is the most common solvent used to produce liquid scintillators for large mass experiments. The knowledge of the refractive index is a pivotal point to understand the detector response, as this quantity (and its wavelength dependence) affects the Cherenkov radiation and photon propagation in the medium. In this paper, we report the measurement of the refractive index of the JUNO liquid scintillator between 260-1064 nm performed with two different methods (an ellipsometer and a refractometer), with a sub percent level precision. In addition, we used an interferometer to measure the group velocity in the JUNO liquid scintillator and verify the expected value derived from the refractive index measurements.</p>

<p>2024-05-30, <strong>CPT, Majorana fermions, and particle physics beyond the Standard Model</strong>, Ken-ichi Hikasa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19774v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19774v1</a></p>

<p>After reviewing charge conjugation and the CPT theorem, we define Majorana fermions and clarify the relationship of Majorana, Weyl, and Dirac fields. Appearance of Majorana fermions in various scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model is discussed, including neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry of the universe, grand unified theories, and supersymmetry.</p>

<p>2024-05-30, <strong>Initial measurement of reactor antineutrino oscillation at SNO+</strong>, SNO+ Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19700v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19700v1</a></p>

<p>The SNO+ collaboration reports its first spectral analysis of long-baseline reactor antineutrino oscillation using 114 tonne-years of data. Fitting the neutrino oscillation probability to the observed energy spectrum yields constraints on the neutrino mass-squared difference $\Delta m^2_{21}$. In the ranges allowed by previous measurements, the best-fit $\Delta m^2_{21}$ is (8.85$^{+1.10}_{-1.33}$) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ eV$^2$. This measurement is continuing in the next phases of SNO+ and is expected to surpass the present global precision on $\Delta m^2_{21}$ with about three years of data.</p>

<p>2024-05-30, <strong>Primitive Pythagorean triples and neutrino mixing</strong>, Yuta Hyodo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19605v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19605v1</a></p>

<p>The primitive Pythagorean triples are the three natural numbers $(a, b, c)$ that satisfy $c^2=a^2+b^2$ in a right triangle. We constructed a neutrino mixing models related to primitive Pythagorean triples that satisfy the observed values within the $3 \sigma$ region for the reactor, solar, and atmospheric neutrino mixing angles, as well as the Dirac CP phase.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Multiphysics Simulations of Thermal Shock Testing of Nanofibrous High Power Targets</strong>, W. Asztalos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19496v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19496v1</a></p>

<p>Increase of primary beam power for neutrino beam-lines leads to a reduced lifespan for production targets. New concepts for robust targets are emerging from the field of High Power Targetry (HPT); one idea being investigated by the HPT R&amp;D Group at Fermilab is an electrospun nanofiber target. As part of their evaluation, samples with different densities were sent to the HiRadMat facility at CERN for thermal shock tests. The samples with the higher density, irradiated under a high intensity beam pulse, exhibit major damage at the impact site whereas those with the lower density show no apparent damage. The exact cause of this failure was unclear at the time. In this paper, we present the results of multiphysics simulations of the thermal shock experienced by the nanofiber targets that suggest the failure originates from the reduced permeability of the high density sample to air flow. The air present in the porous target expands due to heating from the beam, but is unable to flow freely in the high density sample, resulting in a larger back pressure that blows apart the nanofiber mat. We close with a discussion on how to further validate this hypothesis.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Development of Cryogenic Scintillation Detectors for the Search of New Physics</strong>, Keyu Ding et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19476v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19476v1</a></p>

<p>CryoCsI, the proposed prototype, is a cryogenic undoped CsI scintillating detector, which has a much lower energy threshold potentially down to 0.5 keV$_{nr}$ compared to the doped CsI. This enhanced sensitivity of CryoCsI allows for the observation of more Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering events. Precise measurements of CEvNS can not only validate the predictions of the Standard Model but also explore new physics. In conjunction with other COHERENT detectors, CryoCsI has the potential to achieve world-leading sensitivities in a broad range of physics topics within and beyond the SM. The sensitivities of CryoCsI to hidden-sector dark matter, non-standard neutrino interactions, and neutron radius are explored.   This thesis delves into the construction of CryoCsI and efforts to enhance its light yield from 20 to $50 \pm 2$ photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent (keV$_{ee}$). It will address challenges with cryogenic SiPMs, including inferior energy resolution, optical cross-talk, and potential limitations on detecting rare events. Understanding the light yield of scintillating detectors for nuclear recoils is crucial, as explored through alpha-particle and neutron quenching factor measurements. A QF of approximately 15\% was measured using a neutron beam at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Lab. Proposed solutions to challenges like the overshoot effect observed in PMTs will be discussed. Additionally, the thesis will explore design considerations for minimizing background noise and optimizing the CsI crystal’s shape through optical simulations.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Implications of in-ice volume scattering for radio-frequency neutrino experiments</strong>, A. Nozdrina et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19472v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19472v1</a></p>

<p>Over the last three decades, several experimental initiatives have been launched with the goal of observing radio-frequency signals produced by ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHEN) interacting in solid media. Observed neutrino event signatures comprise impulsive signals with duration of order the inverse of the antenna+system bandwidth, superimposed upon an incoherent (typically white noise) thermal noise spectrum. Although bulk volume scattering (VS) of external radio-frequency signals is well-studied within the radar and glaciological communities, and can, in principle, contribute to that background. However, thus far, neutrino experiments have neglected to account for VS when projecting event rates. Herein, we present both model-dependent and model-independent constraints on both coherent, and also incoherent volume scattering, and assess their impact on UHEN experiments. We find that VS contributions are only weakly constrained by extant data; stronger limits may be obtained with dedicated calibration experiments.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Supernova Electron-Neutrino Interactions with Xenon in the nEXO Detector</strong>, nEXO Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19419v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19419v1</a></p>

<p>Electron-neutrino charged-current interactions with xenon nuclei were modeled in the nEXO neutrinoless double-beta decay detector (~5-tonne, 90% ${}^{136}$Xe, 10% ${}^{134}$Xe) to evaluate its sensitivity to supernova neutrinos. Predictions for event rates and detectable signatures were modeled using the MARLEY event generator. We find good agreement between MARLEY’s predictions and existing theoretical calculations of the inclusive cross sections at supernova neutrino energies. The interactions modeled by MARLEY were simulated within the nEXO simulation framework and were run through an example reconstruction algorithm to determine the detector’s efficiency for reconstructing these events. The simulated data, incorporating the detector response, were used to study the ability of nEXO to reconstruct the incident electron-neutrino spectrum and these results were extended to a larger xenon detector of the same isotope enrichment. We estimate that nEXO will be able to observe electron-neutrino interactions with xenon from supernovae as far as 5 to 8 kpc from earth, while the ability to reconstruct incident electron-neutrino spectrum parameters from observed interactions in nEXO is limited to closer supernovae.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Supernova axions convert to gamma-rays in magnetic fields of progenitor stars</strong>, Claudio Andrea Manzari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19393v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19393v1</a></p>

<p>It has long been established that axions could have been produced through the Primakoff process within the nascent proto-neutron-star formed following the type II supernova SN1987A, escaped the star due to their weak interactions, and then converted to gamma-rays in the Galactic magnetic fields; the non-observation of a gamma-ray flash coincident with the neutrino burst leads to strong constraints on the axion-photon coupling for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV. In this work we use SN1987A to constrain, for the first time, higher mass axions, all the way to $m_a \sim 10^{-3}$ eV, by accounting for axion-photon conversion on the still-intact magnetic fields of the progenitor star. Moreover, we show that gamma-ray observations of the next Galactic supernova, leveraging the magnetic fields of the progenitor star, could detect quantum chromodynamics axions for masses above roughly $50$ $\mu$eV, depending on the supernova. We propose a new full-sky gamma-ray satellite constellation that we call the GALactic AXion Instrument for Supernova (GALAXIS) to search for such future signals along with related signals from extragalactic neutron star mergers.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Two classes of Majorana neutrinos in the seesaw model</strong>, Kazuo Fujikawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18702v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18702v1</a></p>

<p>The commonly used pseudo-C symmetry $(\nu_{L})^{c}=C\overline{\nu_{L}}^{T}$ is not defined in Lagrangian field theory. In general, there exist two classes of Majorana fermions; the first is associated with the chiral fermion with the conventional C and P symmetries, and the second is associated with the Weyl fermion defined by CP symmetry only and formally characterised by the pseudo-C symmetry. Taking the seesaw model as an example, it is shown that a generalized Pauli–G"{u}rsey (or Bogoliubov-type) canonical transformation converts the neutrino defined by the Weyl fermion to the neutrino defined by the chiral fermion and thus to the conventional Majorana fermion, while preserving the anti-commutation relations. The mixing angles in the weak lepton sector are not modified by this generalized Pauli–G"{u}rsey transformation.</p>

<p>2024-05-30, <strong>Gravitational Lensing in More Realistic Dark Matter Halo Models</strong>, Ali Tizfahm et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20256v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.20256v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we investigate gravitational lensing within the framework of more realistic dark matter halo models, transcending the limitations of spherical-collapse approximations. Through analytical computations utilizing diverse mass functions, we address critical factors typically overlooked in the standard Press-Schechter formalism, including ellipsoidal-collapse conditions, angular momentum dynamics, dynamical friction, and the cosmological constant. Our analysis incorporates two widely recognized halo density profiles, the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles, considering both spherical and ellipsoidal-collapse scenarios. We present relevant calculations of pivotal gravitational lensing observables, such as Einstein radii, lensing optical depths, and time delays, spanning a wide range of redshifts and masses across two distinct lensing models: the point mass and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) lens models. Our findings illuminate that adopting more realistic dark matter halo models leads to heightened lensing effects compared to their spherical-collapse counterparts. Furthermore, our analyses of lensing optical depths and time delays reveal distinct characteristics between point mass and SIS lens models. These outcomes highlight the need for more realistic halo descriptions instead of simple approximations when modeling gravitational lensing, as this approach can potentially better reveal the complex structures of dark matter.</p>

<p>2024-05-30, <strong>Alleviating the $H_0$ and $σ_8$ tensions in the interacting cubic covariant Galileon model</strong>, Sihem zabat et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20240v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.20240v1</a></p>

<p>The interaction between dark matter and dark energy has become a focal point in contemporary cosmological research, particularly in addressing current cosmological tensions. This study explores the cubic Galileon model’s interaction with dark matter, where the interaction potential in the dark sector is proportional to the dark energy density of the Galileon field. By employing dimensionless variables, we transform the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system. We calculate the critical points of the corresponding autonomous systems and demonstrate the existence of a stable de Sitter epoch. Our investigation proceeds in two phases. First, we conduct a detailed analysis of the exact interacting cubic Galileon (ICG) model, derived from the precise solution of the equations of motion. Second, we explore an approximate tracker solution, labeled TICG, assuming a small coupling parameter between dark matter and dark energy. We evaluate the evolution of these models using data from two experiments, aiming to resolve the tensions surrounding $H_0$ and $S_8$. The analysis of the TICG model indicates a preference for a phantom regime and provides a negative coupling parameter in the dark sector at a $68\%$ confidence level. This model also shows that the current tensions regarding $H_0$ and $S_8$ are alleviated. Conversely, the ICG model, despite its preference for the phantom regime, is plagued by an excess in today’s matter density and a higher expansion rate, easing only the $H_0$ tension.</p>

<p>2024-05-30, <strong>Role of Spatial Curvature in a Dark Energy Interacting Model</strong>, Trupti Patil et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20170v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.20170v1</a></p>

<p>This paper investigates the effects of spatial curvature in a model where dark matter and dark energy interact. The analysis employs a range of datasets, including CMB, BAO, Type Ia Supernova, $H(z)$ from cosmic chronometers, $H_0$ measurements from Megamasers and SH0ES, growth rate data and strong lensing time delay measurements, to assess the model’s fit and explore the late-time dynamics of the interacting dark sector in a non-flat cosmological framework. The study indicates that introducing curvature can significantly impact the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the structure growth parameter ($S_8$), potentially easing tensions between early and late universe observations. The observational data shows an indication for a closed universe. This implies that the presence of curvature and its influence cannot be neglected entirely.</p>

<p>2024-05-30, <strong>Haloes, other dark matter candidates and astrophysical implications</strong>, Philippa S. Cole et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20125v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.20125v1</a></p>

<p>It is possible that a multi-component dark matter model is required if primordial black holes only contribute to a fraction of the energy density in dark matter. This is increasingly more likely with respect to the case of $f_{\rm PBH} = 1$, since there is only one remaining window, on asteroid-mass scales, where primordial black holes can make up all of the dark matter. A mixed dark matter model can lead to interesting observables that come about due to the interactions between primordial black holes and the second dark matter component. This can provide unique signatures of the presence of primordial black holes and increase the prospects of detection or improvement of constraints in the mass ranges where $f_{\rm PBH} &lt; 1$, whilst simultaneously exploring the remaining open parameter space for other dark matter candidates.</p>

<p>2024-05-30, <strong>Formation of the first halos, galaxies and magnetic fields</strong>, M. Demiański et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19910v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19910v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic objects with magnetic fields (quasars, radiogalaxies) are observed at redshifts $z\geq 7$ (Wang et al., 2021, Fan et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2024) and more (for instance, for $z = 10.073\pm 0.002$, Goulding et al., 2023) indicates the early creation of magnetic fields. The observations of the cosmic telescope JWST show that the first galaxies were formed at redshifts $z\simeq$ 15 – 20. We link the transformation of the low mass dark matter halos into galaxies with the creation of the first stars owing to the radiative cooling of partly ionized hydrogen at $z\geq 10$. The early formation of galaxies creates favourable conditions for high impact of the Compton scattering of the relic radiation photons and electrons on the electron temperature and leads to the partial separation of electrons and protons. Together with turbulent motions such separation stimulates creation of magnetic fields on a galactic scale. The same processes distort the primordial perturbations of the relic radiation what can be observed and confirmed in special simulations.</p>

<p>The galactic 511~keV photon signal can be fully explained by the decaying dark matter generated through the freeze-in mechanism. The explanation of the 511~keV signal requires an extremely tiny coupling between the decaying dark matter and $e^+e^-$ pair and thus cannot be generated via direct freeze-in from standard model particles. We construct models involving two $U(1)$ hidden sectors, one of which couples directly to the standard model, the other couples directly to the first hidden sector while couples indirectly to the standard model. The decaying dark photon dark matter, which explains the 511~keV signal, is generated via a two-step freeze-in process. In the models we study, the freeze-in mechanism generates the entire dark matter relic density, and thus any types of additional dark matter components produced from other sources are unnecessary. The two-$U(1)$ model remains a strong candidate for explaining the 511 keV signal consistent with various dark matter density profiles.</p>

<p>Microlensed stars recently discovered by JWST &amp; HST follow closely the winding critical curve of A370 along all sections of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dragon Arc" traversed by the critical curve. These transients are fainter than $m\_{AB}&gt;26.5$, corresponding to the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and microlensed by diffuse cluster stars observed with $\simeq 18M\_\odot/pc^2$, or about $\simeq 1$\% of the projected dark matter density. Most microlensed stars appear along the inner edge of the critical curve, following an asymmetric band of width $\simeq 4$kpc that is skewed by $-0.7\pm0.2$kpc. Some skewness is expected as the most magnified images should form along the inner edge of the critical curve with negative parity, but the predicted shift is small $\simeq -0.04$kpc and the band of predicted detections is narrow, $\simeq 1.4$kpc. Adding CDM-like dark halos of $10^{6-8}M\_\odot$ broadens the band as desired but favours detections along the outer edge of the critical curve, in the wrong direction, where sub-halos generate local Einstein rings. Instead, the interference inherent to</code>Wave Dark Matter” as a Bose-Einstein condensate ($\psi$DM) forms a symmetric band of critical curves that favours negative parity detections. A de Broglie wavelength of $\simeq 10$pc matches well the observed $4$kpc band of microlenses and predicts negative skewness $\simeq -0.6$kpc, similar to the data. The implied corresponding boson mass is $\simeq 10^{-22}$eV, in good agreement with estimates from dwarf galaxy cores when scaled by momentum. Further JWST imaging may reveal the pattern of critical curves by simply ``joining the dots” between microlensed stars, allowing wave corrugations of $\psi$DM to be distinguished from CDM sub-halos</p>

<p>The hierarchical model of galaxy formation predicts that the Milky Way halo is populated by tidal debris of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. Due to long dynamical times, debris from the lowest mass objects remains coherent as thin and dynamically cold stellar streams for billions of years. The Gaia mission, providing astrometry and spectrophotometry for billions of stars, has brought three fundamental changes to our view of stellar streams in the Milky Way. First, more than a hundred stellar streams have been discovered and characterized using Gaia data. This is an order of magnitude increase in the number of known streams, thanks to Gaia’s capacity for identifying comoving groups of stars among the field Milky Way population. Second, Gaia data have revealed that density variations both along and across stellar streams are common. Dark-matter subhalos, as well as baryonic structures were theoretically predicted to form such features, but observational evidence for density variations was uncertain before Gaia. Third, stream kinematics are now widely available and have constrained the streams’ orbits and origins. Gaia has not only provided proper motions directly, but also enabled efficient spectroscopic follow-up of the proper-motion selected targets. These discoveries have established stellar streams as a dense web of sensitive gravitational tracers in the Milky Way halo. We expect the coming decade to bring a full mapping of the Galactic population of stellar streams, as well as develop numerical models that accurately capture their evolution within the Milky Way for a variety of cosmological models. Perhaps most excitingly, the comparison between the two will be able to reveal the presence of dark-matter subhalos below the threshold for galaxy formation (~10^6 Msun), and provide the most stringent test of the cold dark matter paradigm on small scales.</p>

<p>Context. Merging compact objects such as binary black holes provide a promising probe for the physics of dark matter (DM). The gravitational waves emitted during inspiral potentially allow to detect DM spikes around black holes. This is because the dynamical friction force experienced by the inspiraling black hole alters the orbital period and thus the gravitational wave signal. Aims. The dynamical friction arising from DM can potentially differ from the collisionless case when DM is subject to self-interactions. This paper aims to understand how self-interactions impact dynamical friction. Methods. To study the dynamical friction force, we use idealized N-body simulations, where we include self-interacting dark matter. Results. We find that the dynamical friction force for inspiraling black holes would be typically enhanced by DM self-interactions compared to a collisionless medium (ignoring differences in the DM density). At lower velocities below the sound speed, we find that the dynamical friction force can be reduced by the presence of self-interactions. Conclusions. DM self-interactions have a significant effect on the dynamical friction for black hole mergers. Assuming the Chandrasekhar formula may underpredict the deceleration due to dynamical friction.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Gravitational Production of Completely Dark Photons with Nonminimal Couplings to Gravity</strong>, Christian Capanelli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19390v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19390v1</a></p>

<p>Dark photons are a theorized massive spin-1 particle which can be produced via various mechanisms, including cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) in the early universe. In this work, we extend previous results for GPP of dark photons to include nonminimal couplings to gravity. We find that nonminimal couplings can induce a ghost instability or lead to runaway particle production at high momentum and discuss the constraints on the parameter space such that the theory is free of instabilities. Within the instability-free regime we numerically calculate the particle production and find that the inclusion of nonminimal couplings can lead to an enhancement of the particle number. As a result, GPP of nonminimally coupled dark photons can open the parameter space for production of a cosmological relevant relic density (constituting all or part of the dark matter) as compared to the minimally-coupled theory. These results are independent of the choice of inflation model, which we demonstrate by repeating the analysis for a class of rapid-turn multi-field inflation models.</p>

<p>We show that if dark matter consists of QCD axions in the post-inflationary scenario more than ten percent of it efficiently collapses into Bose stars at matter-radiation equality. Such a result is mostly independent of the present uncertainties on the axion mass. This large population of solitons, with asteroid masses and Earth-Moon distance sizes, might plausibly survive until today, with potentially interesting implications for phenomenology and experimental searches.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Detecting the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Black Holes in Slow-reheating Scenarios</strong>, Luis E. Padilla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19271v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19271v1</a></p>

<p>After primordial inflation, the universe may have experienced a prolonged reheating epoch, potentially leading to a phase of matter domination supported by the oscillating inflaton field. During such an epoch, perturbations in the inflaton virialize upon reentering the cosmological horizon, forming inflaton structures. If the primordial overdensities are sufficiently large, these structures collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). To occur at a significant rate, this process requires an enhanced primordial power spectrum (PPS) at small scales. The enhancement of the PPS, as well as the formation and tidal interaction of the primordial structures, will in turn source a stochastic gravitational wave background(SGWB) that could be detected by current and/or future gravitational wave detectors. In this paper, we study the SGWB arising from these different sources during slow-reheating, focusing on a PPS that satisfies the requirements necessary for the formation of PBHs with a mass of $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq 10^{21}$ and that constitute the entirety of dark matter in the universe.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Dark matter admixed neutron stars with a realistic nuclear equation of state from chiral nuclear interactions</strong>, Domenico Scordino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19251v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19251v1</a></p>

<p>We study the effects of dark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars. In particular we investigate how the presence of a dark matter component influences the mass-radius relation, the value of the maximum mass of a neutron star and others stellar properties. To model ordinary matter we use a state-of-the-art equation of state of $\beta$-stable nuclear matter obtained using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock quantum many-body approach starting from two-body and three-body nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory. The dark matter component of the star is modeled as a non-self-annihilating system of spin $1/2$ fermions and its equation of state as an ideal relativistic Fermi gas. The equilibrium configurations of these dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) are calculated by solving a generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to the case where the system consists of two perfect fluids interacting solely through gravity. We find that, depending on the dark matter particle mass $m_\chi$, one can have somehow opposite effects on the stellar properties. In the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, the stellar gravitational maximum mass $M_{max}$ decreases, whereas in the case $m_\chi = 0.1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, $M_{max}$ increases with respect to the maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars. We also show that the presence of dark matter has indirect sizeable effect on the proton fraction in the ordinary matter fluid and, in the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, results in a decrease of the threshold gravitational mass $M_{tot}^{durca}$ for having direct URCA processes and fast stellar cooling. Finally we study the stability of dark matter admixed neutron stars with respect to radial perturbations.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals with general dynamical friction in dark matter minispikes</strong>, Yu-Chen Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19240v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19240v1</a></p>

<p>The intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) may be surrounded by dark matter (DM) minispikes. The dynamical friction from these DM minispike structures can affect the dynamics and the gravitational wave (GW) emission of the IMRIs. We analyze the effects of general dynamical friction, with a particular contribution from DM particles moving faster than the stellar-mass black hole in an eccentric IMRI. The results show that the dynamical friction caused by these DM particles tends to eccentricify the orbit, and the general dynamical friction is able to increase the eccentricity. We also analyze the effects of general dynamical friction on the GW characteristic strain. The results indicate that the peak value of the characteristic strain occurs at higher frequencies as the power law index of DM minispike $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ increases. For the first time, a general analytical relation between the frequency peak value of characteristic strain of GWs and $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ is established. Using the analytical relation, the presence of DM and its halo density may be determined potentially from future GW data.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>On the Galactic rotation curve inferred from the Jeans equations Assessing its robustness using Gaia DR3 and cosmological simulations</strong>, Orlin Koop et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19028v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19028v1</a></p>

<p>Several works have recently applied Jeans modelling to Gaia-based datasets to infer the circular velocity curve for the Milky Way. Such works have consistently found evidence for a continuous decline in the rotation curve beyond $\sim$15kpc possibly indicative of a light dark matter halo. We used Gaia DR3 RVS data, supplemented with Bayesian distances to determine the radial variation of the second moments of the velocity distribution for stars close to the Galactic plane. We have used these profiles to determine the rotation curve using the Jeans equations under the assumption of axisymmetry and explored how they vary with azimuth and above and below the Galactic disk plane. We have applied the same methodology to an N-body simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy impacted by a satellite akin the Sagittarius dwarf and to the Auriga suite of cosmological simulations. We reveal evidence of disequilibrium and deviations from axisymmetry closer in. We find that the second moment of $V_R$ flattens out at $R \gtrsim 12.5$kpc, and that the second moment of $V_{\phi}$ is different above and below the plane for $R \gtrsim 11$kpc. The simulations indicate that these features are typical of galaxies that have been perturbed by external satellites. They also suggest that the difference between the true circular velocity curve and that inferred from Jeans equations can be as high as 15$\%$, but is likely of order 10$\%$ for the Milky Way. This is of larger amplitude than the systematics inherent to Jeans equations. However, if the density of the tracer population were truncated at large radii, the erroneous conclusion of a steeply declining rotation curve can be reached. We find that steady-state axisymmetric Jeans modelling becomes less robust at large radii, indicating that particular caution is needed when interpreting the rotation curve inferred in those regions.</p>

<p>The Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, the most recently discovered elementary particle, may still serve as a mediator between the SM sector and a new physics sector related to dark matter (DM). The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has not yet fully constrained the physics associated with the Higgs boson, leaving room for such possibilities. Among the various potential mass scales of the dark sector, the sub-GeV mass range is particularly intriguing. This parameter space presents significant challenges for DM direct detection experiments that rely on nuclear recoils. Various innovative experimental methods are currently under investigation to explore this sub-GeV dark sector. The LHC, functioning as a Higgs factory, could explore this sector once the challenge of identifying DM signals is resolved. Due to the significantly lower mass of particles in the dark sector compared to the Higgs boson, these particles are expected to be highly boosted following the Higgs boson’s decay. However, detecting and identifying these highly boosted particles remains a considerable challenge at the LHC, despite their eventual decay into SM particles. We employ a well-motivated leptophobic $Z^{\prime}_B$ model as a prototype to analyze the distinctive signatures from Higgs boson exotic decays into multi-photons. These signatures consist of collimated photons that fail to meet the photon isolation criteria, forming jet-like objects. Conventional analyses relying solely on the purity of energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter would fail to detect these signatures, as they would be overwhelmed by background events from Quantum Chromodynamics. To effectively distinguish between such novel signal signatures and SM background events, we leverage advanced machine learning techniques, specifically the transformer encoder in a multimodal network structure.</p>

<p>In this article, we anchor our analysis on the premise that the presence of a photon sphere is an intrinsic characteristic of any ultra-compact gravitational structure with spherical symmetry. Utilizing the concept of a topological photon sphere, we categorize the behaviors of diverse gravitational models based on the structure of their photon spheres. This innovative approach enables us to define boundaries for black hole parameters, which subsequently allows us to classify the model as either a black hole or a naked singularity. Indeed, we will demonstrate that the existence of this reciprocal relationship between the gravitational structure and the presence of a photon sphere offers a unique advantage that can be directly and inversely harnessed. Furthermore, we present a precise correlation between the behavior of the defined effective potential and the total topological charge for each model. Through an independent examination of the effective potential, we show that a gravitational model typically exhibits naked singularity behavior when at least one effective potential minimum (a stable photon sphere) protrudes beyond the event horizon. Finally, we will compare the effect of adding perfect fluid dark matter to the models under study and observe the impact of this quantity on the behavior of the photon sphere and the extent of their dominance.</p>

<p>We develop a model of globular cluster (GC) formation within the cosmological hierarchy of structure formation. The model is rooted in the `two-phase’ scenario of galaxy formation developed in Paper-I, where the fast accretion of dark matter halos at high redshift leads to the formation of self-gravitating, turbulent gas clouds that subsequently fragment into dynamically hot systems of dense sub-clouds with masses $\sim 10^6$-$10^7 M_\odot$. Here we elaborate on the formation, evolution, and fate of these sub-clouds, and show that some of the sub-clouds can be compactified via two distinctive channels into a ‘supernova-free’ regime to form two distinct populations of GCs. The model is simple, characterized by a small number of free parameters underpinned by physical considerations, and can be efficiently implemented into cosmological N-body simulations to generate a coherent sample of halos, galaxies, and GCs. Our model can reproduce a range of observations on GCs, including the mass function, the size-mass relation, the frequency per unit host galaxy/halo mass, the bimodal metallicity distribution, and the spatial profile. Predictions for GCs are made for both the local Universe and for redshift up to $z \approx 10$, and can be tested by upcoming observations.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the effects of spatial curvature in a model where dark matter and dark energy interact. The analysis employs a range of datasets, including CMB, BAO, Type Ia Supernova, $H(z)$ from cosmic chronometers, $H_0$ measurements from Megamasers and SH0ES, growth rate data and strong lensing time delay measurements, to assess the model’s fit and explore the late-time dynamics of the interacting dark sector in a non-flat cosmological framework. The study indicates that introducing curvature can significantly impact the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the structure growth parameter ($S_8$), potentially easing tensions between early and late universe observations. The observational data shows an indication for a closed universe. This implies that the presence of curvature and its influence cannot be neglected entirely.</p>

<p>We examine the pair-instability origin of superluminous supernova 2018ibb. As the base model, we use a non-rotating stellar model with an initial mass of 250 Msun at about 1/15 solar metallicity. We consider three versions of the model as input for radiative transfer simulations done with the STELLA and ARTIS codes: with 25 Msun of 56Ni, 34 Msun of 56Ni, and a chemically mixed case with 34 Msun of 56Ni. We present light curves and spectra in comparison to the observed data of SN 2018ibb, and conclude that the pair-instability supernova model with 34 Msun of 56Ni explains broad-band light curves reasonably well between -100 and 250 days around the peak. Our synthetic spectra have many similarities with the observed spectra. The luminosity excess in the light curves and the blue-flux excess in the spectra can be explained by an additional energy source, which may be interaction of the SN ejecta with circumstellar matter. We discuss possible mechanisms of the origin of the circumstellar matter being ejected in the decades before the pair-instability explosion.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Almost All Carbon/Oxygen White Dwarfs Can Support Double Detonations</strong>, Ken J. Shen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19417v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19417v1</a></p>

<p>Double detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) in unstably mass-transferring double WD binaries have become a leading contender to explain most, if not all, Type Ia supernovae. However, past theoretical studies of the explosion process have assumed relatively ad hoc initial conditions for the helium shells in which the double detonations begin. In this work, we construct realistic C/O WDs to use as the starting points for multidimensional double detonation simulations. We supplement these with simplified one-dimensional detonation calculations to gain a physical understanding of the conditions under which shell detonations can propagate successfully. We find that C/O WDs &lt;= 1.0 Msol, which make up the majority of C/O WDs, are born with structures that can support double detonations. More massive C/O WDs require ~1e-3 Msol of accretion before detonations can successfully propagate in their shells, but such accretion may be common in the double WD binaries that host massive WDs. Our findings strongly suggest that if the direct impact accretion stream reaches high enough temperatures and densities during mass transfer from one WD to another, the accreting WD will undergo a double detonation. Furthermore, if the companion is also a C/O WD &lt;= 1.0 Msol, it will undergo its own double detonation when impacted by the ejecta from the first explosion. Exceptions to this outcome may explain the newly discovered class of hypervelocity supernova survivors.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Metallicity Dependence of Pressure-Regulated Feedback-Modulated Star Formation in the TIGRESS-NCR Simulation Suite</strong>, Chang-Goo Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19227v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19227v1</a></p>

<p>We present a new suite of numerical simulations of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) using the TIGRESS-NCR framework, covering a wide range of galactic conditions including metallicity. The TIGRESS-NCR framework is a model of the ISM in galactic disks that solves ideal MHD equations with self-gravity in a local shearing-box, including explicit treatment of cooling and heating processes coupled with ray-tracing UV radiation transfer and resolved supernova feedback. The TIGRESS-NCR suite presented in this paper covers metallicity variation $Z’\equiv Z/Z_\odot\sim 0.1-3$, gas surface density $\Sigma_{\rm gas}\sim5-150{\,M_{\odot}{\rm pc^{-2}}}$, and stellar surface density $\Sigma_{\rm star}\sim1-50{M_{\odot}{\rm pc^{-2}}}$, leading to emergent SFR surface density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}\sim 10^{-4}-0.5{M_{\odot}{\rm kpc^{-2}yr^{-1}}}$ and ISM total midplane pressure $P_{\rm tot}/k_B=10^3-10^6 {\rm cm^{-3}K}$, with $P_{\rm tot}$ equal to the ISM weight $W$. In our simulation suite, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto {Z’}^{0.3}$, which can be understood based on feedback physics. We present a new calibration for the components of feedback yield $\Upsilon$, defined as ratios between pressure (thermal, turbulent, and magnetic) and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. We find that the thermal feedback yield varies sensitively as $\Upsilon_{\rm th}\propto W^{-0.46}Z’^{-0.53}$, while the combined turbulent and magnetic feedback yield shows weaker dependence $\Upsilon_{\rm turb+mag}\propto W^{-0.22}Z’^{-0.18}$. The reduced $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ at low metallicity is due mainly to enhanced thermal feedback yield resulting from reduced attenuation of UV radiation. Combining vertical dynamical equilibrium, feedback yield, and effective equation of state, we provide a new metallicity-dependent subgrid star formation prescription that can be used in cosmological simulations where the ISM is unresolved.</p>

<p>The main science aim of the BlackGEM array is to detect optical counterparts to gravitational wave mergers. Additionally, the array will perform a set of synoptic surveys to detect Local Universe transients and short time-scale variability in stars and binaries, as well as a six-filter all-sky survey down to ~22nd mag. The BlackGEM Phase-I array consists of three optical wide-field unit telescopes. Each unit uses an f/5.5 modified Dall-Kirkham (Harmer-Wynne) design with a triplet corrector lens, and a 65cm primary mirror, coupled with a 110Mpix CCD detector, that provides an instantaneous field-of-view of 2.7~square degrees, sampled at 0.564\arcsec/pixel. The total field-of-view for the array is 8.2 square degrees. Each telescope is equipped with a six-slot filter wheel containing an optimised Sloan set (BG-u, BG-g, BG-r, BG-i, BG-z) and a wider-band 440-720 nm (BG-q) filter. Each unit telescope is independent from the others. Cloud-based data processing is done in real time, and includes a transient-detection routine as well as a full-source optimal-photometry module. BlackGEM has been installed at the ESO La Silla observatory as of October 2019. After a prolonged COVID-19 hiatus, science operations started on April 1, 2023 and will run for five years. Aside from its core scientific program, BlackGEM will give rise to a multitude of additional science cases in multi-colour time-domain astronomy, to the benefit of a variety of topics in astrophysics, such as infant supernovae, luminous red novae, asteroseismology of post-main-sequence objects, (ultracompact) binary stars, and the relation between gravitational wave counterparts and other classes of transients</p>

<p>The DESI collaboration have recently analyzed their first year of data, finding a preference for thawing dark energy scenarios when using parameterized equations of state for dark energy. We investigate whether this preference persists when the data is analyzed within the context of a well-studied field theory model of thawing dark energy, exponential quintessence. No preference for this model over $\Lambda$CDM is found, and both models are poorer fits to the data than the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder $w_0$–$w_a$ parameterization. We demonstrate that the worse fit is due to a lack of sharp features in the potential that results in a slowly-evolving dark energy equation of state that does not have enough freedom to simultaneously fit the combination of the supernovae, DESI, and cosmic microwave background data. Our analysis provides guidance for constructing dynamical dark energy models that are able to better accommodate the data.</p>
