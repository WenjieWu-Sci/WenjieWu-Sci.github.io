<p>2025-07-10, <strong>Monophotons from Scalar Portal Dark Matter at Neutrino Experiments</strong>, Bhaskar Dutta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07936v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07936v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we investigate monophoton signatures arising from dark matter via a $2\to 3$ scattering process $\chi + N \to \chi + N + \gamma$ that is mediated by a virtual scalar and a Standard Model photon. Since the final-state photon carries a large fraction of the initial dark matter’s energy, this process offers a compelling handle for probing scalar portal dark matter scenarios. Their distinctive energy, angular, and timing distributions allow for effective separation of signal from neutrino-induced backgrounds. We analyze several models featuring different couplings to the scalar mediator, with the scalar photon coupling serving as the common detection channel. We considered the flux of dark matter produced both at the target and absorber of neutrino facilities such as the BNB, NuMI, and LBNF, and investigated the sensitivities at the ongoing SBND, ICARUS-NuMI, and future DUNE ND detectors. Our results demonstrate that the sensitivities at the considered experiments, especially DUNE ND, can place significantly improved constraints on viable parameter space in various scenarios.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>Machine Learning Tools for the IceCube-Gen2 Optical Array</strong>, Francisco Javier Vara Carbonell et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07844v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07844v1</a></p>

<p>Neural networks (NNs) have a great potential for future neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2, the planned high-energy extension of the IceCube observatory. IceCube-Gen2 will feature new optical sensors with multiple photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) designed to provide omnidirectional sensitivity. Neural networks excel at handling high-dimensional problems and can naturally incorporate the increased complexity of these new sensors. Additionally, their fast inference time makes them promising candidates for handling the high event rates expected from IceCube-Gen2.   This contribution presents potential applications of neural networks in the IceCube-Gen2 in-ice optical array. First, we introduce a method to simulate the IceCube-Gen2 optical modules’ photon acceptance using a NN that leverages the modules’ inherent symmetries. Secondly, we present the status of neutrino NN-based reconstruction efforts, including the adaptation of a novel IceCube technique that combines normalizing flows with transformer NNs. Finally, we describe current progress in noise cleaning applications based on node classification with graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that has already shown promising results for the forthcoming low-energy extension, IceCube-Upgrade.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>Probing ultra-high-energy neutrinos with the IceCube-Gen2 in-ice radio array</strong>, Christian Glaser et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07813v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07813v1</a></p>

<p>The next generation neutrino telescope, IceCube-Gen2, will be sensitive to the astrophysical and cosmogenic flux of neutrinos across a broad energy range, from the TeV to the EeV scale. The planned design includes 8 cubic kilometers of ice instrumented with approximately 10,000 optical sensors, a surface array, and a radio array of antennas embedded in the ice laid out sparsely over 500 km^2. The radio array provides sensitivity to ultra-high energy neutrinos using independent radio stations that can trigger on Askaryan emission from neutrino interactions in the ice. In this contribution, we present the design for the radio array along with its planned implementation, which is expected to increase sensitivity to neutrinos with energies beyond 100PeV by at least an order of magnitude over existing arrays. Furthermore, we will quantify the expected science output by presenting measurement forecasts for the main science cases of diffuse flux and point source discovery, as well as cross-section and flavor measurements.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>The sensitivity of liquid scintillator detectors to CP-violation with atmospheric neutrinos</strong>, Thilo Birkenfeld et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07598v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07598v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of CP violation in neutrino oscillations is one of the most important goals of the next generation of neutrino experiments. Here we study the detectability of the CP-violating phase in the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos. Liquid scintillator detectors of a few kilotons can probe the low-energy range of the atmospheric neutrino flux. We calculate the expected rate, spectrum, and zenith angle distribution for a typical liquid scintillator detector for different detector sites. We include a typical detector response with different capabilities for flavour identification and a background model. The sensitivity is estimated using a Poisson likelihood analysis. In the case of maximal CP violation, the sensitivity can reach $4\,\sigma$ ($90\%~c.l.$) for perfect flavour identification.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>The Impact of Natal Kicks on Black Hole Binaries</strong>, Alejandro Vigna-Gómez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07573v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07573v1</a></p>

<p>In massive binary-star systems, supernova explosions can significantly alter the orbit during the formation of compact objects. Some compact objects are predicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and no baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released via neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their emission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH) formation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the gravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low natal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate natal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a decrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For large natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain bound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence. For binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to reconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario. This suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only arise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work. Consequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries within the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind complete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete collapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries. Although Gaia may help shed light on these systems, longer observational baselines will likely be needed to fully understand the roles of neutrino natal kicks and stellar collapse in BH formation.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>Inhomogeneous stellar mixing in the final hours before the Cassiopeia A supernova</strong>, Toshiki Sato et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07563v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07563v1</a></p>

<p>Understanding stars and their evolution is a key goal of astronomical research and has long been a focus of human interest. In recent years, theorists have paid much attention to the final interior processes within massive stars, as they can be essential for revealing neutrino-driven supernova mechanisms and other potential transients of massive star collapse. However, it is challenging to observe directly the last hours of a massive star before explosion, since it is the supernova event that triggers the start of intense observational study. Here we report evidence for a final phase of stellar activity known as a ``shell merger’’, an intense shell burning in which the O-burning shell swallows its outer C-/Ne-burning shell, deep within the progenitor’s interior moments before the supernova explosion. In the violent convective layer created by the shell merger, Ne, which is abundant in the stellar O-rich layer, is burned as it is pulled inward, and Si, which is synthesized inside, is transported outward. The remnant still preserves some traces of such Ne-rich downflows and Si-rich upflows in the O-rich layer, suggesting that inhomogeneous shell-merger mixing began just hours ($\lesssim 10^4$ s) before its gravitational collapse. Our results provide the first observational evidence that the final stellar burning process rapidly alters the internal structure, leaving a pre-supernova asymmetry. This breaking of spherical symmetry facilitates the explosion of massive stars and influences various supernova and remnant characteristics, including explosion asymmetries and the neutron star’s kick and spin.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>Reconstruction of cosmic-ray properties with GNN in GRAND</strong>, Arsène Ferrière et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07541v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07541v1</a></p>

<p>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect and study ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos by observing the radio emissions produced in extensive air showers. The GRANDProto300 prototype primarily focuses on UHE cosmic rays to demonstrate the autonomous detection and reconstruction techniques that will later be applied to neutrino detection. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing the arrival direction and energy with high precision using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques from noisy simulated voltage traces. For each event, we represent the triggered antennas as a graph structure, which is used as input for a graph neural network (GNN). To significantly enhance precision and reduce the required training set size, we incorporate physical knowledge into both the GNN architecture and the input data. This approach achieves an angular resolution of 0.14{\deg} and a primary energy reconstruction resolution of about 15%. Additionally, we employ uncertainty estimation methods to improve the reliability of our predictions. These methods allow us to quantify the confidence of the GNN predictions and provide confidence intervals for the direction and energy reconstruction. Finally, we explore strategies to evaluate the consistency and robustness of the model when applied to real data. Our goal is to identify situations where predictions remain trustworthy despite domain shifts between simulation and reality.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>A search for extremely-high-energy neutrinos with IceCube and implications for the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray proton fraction</strong>, Maximilian Meier et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07497v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07497v1</a></p>

<p>When ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) interact with ambient photon backgrounds, a flux of extremely-high-energy (EHE), so-called cosmogenic, neutrinos is produced. The observation of these neutrinos with IceCube can probe the nature of UHECRs. We present a search for EHE neutrinos using $12.6 \, \mathrm{years}$ of IceCube data. The non-observation of neutrinos with energies $\gtrsim 10 \, \mathrm{PeV}$ constrains the all-flavor neutrino flux at $1 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be below $E^2 \Phi_{\nu_e + \nu_\mu + \nu_\tau} \simeq 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{GeV} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, the most stringent limit to date. This constrains the proton fraction in UHECRs of energy above $30 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be $\lesssim 70\%$ if the evolution of the UHECR sources is similar to the star formation rate. Our analysis circumvents uncertainties associated with hadronic interaction models in studies of UHECR air showers, which also suggest a heavy composition at such energies.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>New Public Neutrino Alerts for Clusters of IceCube Events</strong>, Sarah Mancina et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07491v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07491v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory searches for the origins of astrophysical neutrinos using various techniques to overcome the significant backgrounds produced by cosmic-ray air showers. One such technique involves combining the neutrino data with other cosmic messengers to identify spatial and temporal correlations. IceCube contributes to multi-messenger astrophysics (MMA) by providing alerts for interesting events observed in the detector. The Gamma-ray Follow-Up (GFU) cluster alert system is one stream that identifies potential neutrino flares in realtime, producing around 20 alerts per year. GFU-cluster alerts have been privately shared with Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) through memoranda of understanding since IceCube’s predecessor, AMANDA. To preserve blindness to the full behavior of our data, the current system mutes updates from sources following the initial GFU-cluster alert sent, preventing further updates until the activity drops below the alert threshold. With growing knowledge of the potential environments that produce astrophysical neutrinos and to foster open collaboration, the GFU-cluster alerts will shift to be publicly shared. Additionally, the new alert platform will provide all above-threshold information such that the source behavior after the initial alert is not obscured. The above threshold data will be distributed through an interactive website that will update the community on the status of active GFU-cluster alerts. This presentation will introduce the new GFU-cluster platform and the accompanying website, soon to be accessible to the MMA community.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>A comparative study of physics capabilities of a liquid argon and a water based liquid scintillator at DUNE</strong>, Nishat Fiza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07476v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07476v1</a></p>

<p>We present a comprehensive comparison of the physics sensitivities of a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) and a Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) detector, considering their potential deployment as the fourth far detector module in the DUNE facility. Using GLoBES-based simulations, we evaluate their performance in measuring standard neutrino oscillation parameters ($\theta_{23}, \delta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{31}$), both in standard 3-neutrino case, as well as in presence of new physics scenarios involving light sterile neutrinos and neutral-current non-standard interactions (NC NSI). Our findings show that THEIA (a WbLS-based detector) significantly outperforms LArTPC in resolving the CP phase $\delta_{13}$,- especially near maximal CP violation, and in lifting the octant degeneracy of $\theta_{23}$ due to its superior energy resolution and ability to clearly identify the second oscillation maximum. Furthermore, THEIA offers competitive reconstruction precision even with relatively moderate energy resolutions ($7-10\%/\sqrt{E}$) and demonstrates enhanced robustness under new physics scenarios. These results support the physics-driven case for a hybrid DUNE configuration utilizing both LArTPC and WbLS technologies for optimized sensitivity across the full spectrum of neutrino oscillation and physics beyond the standard model.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>Advanced Northern Tracks Selection using a Graph Convolutional Neural Network for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</strong>, Philipp Soldin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07452v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07452v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer detector located in the Antarctic ice at the geographic South Pole. It reads out over 5,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect Cherenkov light produced by secondary particles, enabling IceCube to identify both atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. One of the main challenges in this effort is effectively distinguishing between muons induced by neutrinos and those generated by cosmic-ray air showers. To address this challenge, the Advanced Northern Tracks Selection (ANTS) employs a graph convolutional neural network. This network is designed to utilize both the sensor data and the geometric arrangement of the detector’s photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). By representing each module as a node in a graph and extracting features from each module, the network can capture and integrate both local and global features. This work details the implementation of the network architecture and highlights the improvements in background rejection efficiency compared to existing methods for selecting muon tracks.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>Classification of high energy muon bundles and single muons from the southern sky in IceCube</strong>, Najia Moureen Binte Amin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07408v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07408v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the geographic South Pole, uses the glacial ice volume to detect astrophysical neutrinos. Detection of the neutrinos from the northern sky provides the opportunity to use a large effective volume. However, as the cross-section increases with energy, most high-energy neutrinos are absorbed by the Earth. On the other hand, probing down-going PeV neutrinos from the southern sky becomes challenging because of the large cosmic ray induced muon backgrounds. This contribution presents a method for classifying atmospheric muon bundles and single muons by analyzing the lateral and longitudinal characteristics of through-going track-like events from the southern sky. Muons generated in cosmic ray air showers form muon bundles, exhibiting a lateral spread spanning tens of meters within IceCube. We explore the time residual feature for the observed Cherenkov light to separate bundles from single muons. We also utilize energy losses along the track, which lead to fluctuations in the light intensity: bundles follow a smooth pattern, whereas single muons are more stochastic. A Boosted Decision Tree algorithm is trained on simulated, well-reconstructed cosmic ray and neutrino events to classify neutrino-induced single muons and cosmic ray bundles.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>The GRAND@Auger Prototype for the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection</strong>, Beatriz de Errico et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07407v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07407v1</a></p>

<p>As of early 2025, the GRAND Collaboration operates three prototype arrays: GRANDProto300 in China, GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, and GRAND@Auger in Argentina. The GRAND@Auger prototype was established through an agreement between the GRAND and Pierre Auger Collaborations, repurposing ten Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) stations as GRAND detection units. This setup provides a unique opportunity for coincident air-shower detection, enabling direct event-by-event comparison between GRAND@Auger and the well-established Pierre Auger detectors. Such comparisons allow for a detailed assessment of the detection principle and reconstruction capabilities of GRAND. In this contribution, we present an overview of the commissioning and preliminary results of GRAND@Auger, including the measurement of the Galactic background noise and the detection of the first self-triggered candidate event in coincidence with the Pierre Auger Observatory. Both results underscore the role of GRAND@Auger in advancing the GRAND project and refining the techniques required for large-scale radio detection of ultra-high-energy particles.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>LIQUIDating the Gallium Anomaly</strong>, Garv Chauhan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07397v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07397v1</a></p>

<p>The gallium anomaly has a global significance of greater than $5\sigma$. Most viable BSM solutions quickly run into strong tensions with reactor and solar neutrino data. We propose to use indium (${}^{115}\text{In}$) as a target as it offers a low threshold and reasonably high cross section. The neutrino-indium charged current cross section can be calibrated using the well-constrained solar ${}^{7}\text{Be}$ neutrino flux that lies very close in energy to the ${}^{51}\text{Cr}$ neutrino lines. The triple coincidence provided by ${}^{115}\text{In}$ neutrino capture can be fully exploited by an opaque scintillation detector that also provides energy and position information. We show that a $100$ ton indium target combined with 2 source runs of a $3.4$ MCi ${}^{51}\text{Cr}$ source can probe the complete parameter space of the gallium anomaly, both in the context of a vanilla sterile neutrino as well as more involved BSM scenarios.</p>

<p>Despite extensive efforts, discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrino sources remains elusive. We present an event-level simultaneous maximum likelihood analysis of tracks and cascades using IceCube data collected from April 6, 2008 to May 23, 2022 to search the whole sky for neutrino sources and, using a source catalog, for coincidence of neutrino emission with gamma-ray emission. This is the first time a simultaneous fit of different detection channels is used to conduct a time-integrated all-sky scan with IceCube. Combining all-sky tracks, with superior pointing-power and sensitivity in the northern sky, with all-sky cascades, with good energy-resolution and sensitivity in the southern sky, we have developed the most sensitive point-source search to date by IceCube which targets the entire sky. The most significant point in the northern sky aligns with NGC 1068, a Seyfert II galaxy, which shows a 3.5$\sigma$ excess over background after accounting for trials. The most significant point in the southern sky does not align with any source in the catalog and is not significant after accounting for trials. A search for the single most significant Gaussian flare at the locations of NGC 1068, PKS 1424+240, and the southern highest significance point shows results consistent with expectations for steady emission. Notably, this is the first time that a flare shorter than four years has been excluded as being responsible for NGC 1068’s emergence as a neutrino source. Our results show that combining tracks and cascades when conducting neutrino source searches improves sensitivity and can lead to new discoveries.</p>

<p>GRAND (the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) is a proposed next-generation observatory targetting primarily the detection of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, with energies exceeding about 100 PeV. GRAND is envisioned as a collection of large-scale ground arrays of self-triggered radio antennas that target the radio emission from extensive air showers initiated by UHE particles. Three prototype arrays are presently in operation: GRANDProto300 in China, with 65 units running since end of 2024, GRAND@Auger in Argentina with 10 units deployed on the site of the Pierre Auger Observatory, and GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, a 4-unit setup installed at the Nan\c{c}ay radio-observatory and used for test purposes. The main objective of the GRAND prototype phase is to validate the detection principle and technology of GRAND, in preparation for its next phase, GRAND10k. GRAND10k will consist of two arrays of 10’000 antennas each, covering both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, to be deployed from 2030 on. Here we give an overview of the GRAND concept, its science goals, the status of the prototypes, their performances and first detection of cosmic rays, and the technical perspective they open for the future.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Determining the orientation of radio antennas at the South Pole using Galactic noise measurements</strong>, Paras Koundal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07224v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07224v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a multi-messenger observatory at the South Pole. As preparation for an enhancement of its surface array, IceTop, a prototype station consisting of elevated scintillation panels and radio antennas has been installed and is operating since 2020. The radio antennas detect emissions from cosmic-ray-induced air showers, and their precise orientation is essential for an accurate reconstruction of the air-shower properties. This work presents a novel method to determine the orientation by analyzing periodic variations of the Galactic background noise recorded by the antennas. In particular, we examine noise level variations correlated with the Earth’s rotation and the apparent position of the Galactic Center. The method can provide a potential alternative or augment GPS-based measurements of the alignment of radio antennas at the South Pole.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Measurement of the Three-Flavor Composition of Astrophysical Neutrinos with Contained IceCube Events</strong>, Aswathi Balagopal V. et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07212v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07212v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole detects neutrinos from the entire sky, both of astrophysical and atmospheric origin, via the Cherenkov light emitted when these neutrinos interact in the ice, giving rise to rapidly moving charged particles. Neutrino events with vertices contained within the detector volume are useful for studying the neutrino flavor ratio, as they allow for a better reconstruction of the event morphology. The Medium Energy Starting Events (MESE) data sample is a selection of such events with energies of at least 1 TeV. This sample includes electron-, muon-, and tau-neutrino events, processed consistently. We use it to constrain the flavor ratio of astrophysical neutrinos at Earth, which in turn informs us of the flavor composition at the source itself. In this talk, we will present the results of this study, based on 11.4 years of IceCube data.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Exploring Quantum Statistics for Dirac and Majorana Neutrinos using Spinor-Helicity techniques</strong>, Innes Bigaran et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07180v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07180v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, there has been interest in the applicability of quantum statistics to distinguish Dirac from Majorana neutrinos in multi-neutrino final states. In particular, debate has arisen over the validity of the Dirac-Majorana confusion theorem in these processes, i.e. that any distinction between the Dirac and Majorana processes goes to zero as the neutrino mass goes to zero. Here we approach this problem equipped with spinor-helicity methods generalized for massive Dirac and Majorana fermions. We explicitly calculate all helicity amplitudes for the decay of a light scalar particle to two neutrinos and two oppositely charged leptons. This allows us to pinpoint the crucial steps which could lead to claims of a violation of the confusion theorem. We show that if the correct anti-symmetrization of Dirac to Majorana amplitudes is used, identification of which is clear in this framework, and all relevant contributions are appropriately summed, a scalar decay into two charged leptons and two neutrinos satisfies the Dirac-Majorana confusion theorem.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Ten-dimensional neural network emulator for the nonlinear matter power spectrum</strong>, Yanhui Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07177v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07177v1</a></p>

<p>We present GokuNEmu, a ten-dimensional neural network emulator for the nonlinear matter power spectrum, designed to support next-generation cosmological analyses. Built on the Goku $N$-body simulation suite and the T2N-MusE emulation framework, GokuNEmu predicts the matter power spectrum with $\sim 0.5 \%$ average accuracy for redshifts $0 \leq z \leq 3$ and scales $0.006 \leq k/(h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}) \leq 10$. The emulator models a 10D parameter space that extends beyond $\Lambda$CDM to include dynamical dark energy (characterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$), massive neutrinos ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of neutrinos ($N_\text{eff}$), and running of the spectral index ($\alpha_\text{s}$). Its broad parameter coverage, particularly for the extensions, makes it the only matter power spectrum emulator capable of testing recent dynamical dark energy constraints from DESI. In addition, it requires only $\sim $2 milliseconds to predict a single cosmology on a laptop, orders of magnitude faster than existing emulators. These features make GokuNEmu a uniquely powerful tool for interpreting observational data from upcoming surveys such as LSST, Euclid, the Roman Space Telescope, and CSST.</p>

<p>We present an analysis of the lepton-number and lepton-flavour-violating process of muon-to-positron conversion $\mu^- + N \rightarrow e^+ + N’$, in the presence of an ultralight scalar dark matter (ULSDM) field which couples to neutrinos. The ULSDM contributes to the effective off-diagonal Majorana mass $ m_{\mu e}$, therefore amplifying the rate of muon-to-positron conversion to experimentally observable levels. Using existing bounds from SINDRUM II, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, we derive constraints on the flavour-off-diagonal couplings of neutrinos to ULSDM for the first time. Our work reveals that upcoming experiments can provide stronger sensitivity to these new couplings than bounds arising from cosmological surveys and terrestrial experiments.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>IceCube population constraints on neutrino emission by Fermi-LAT detected active galactic nuclei</strong>, Sam Hori et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07098v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07098v1</a></p>

<p>Gamma-ray-bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been one of the most promising source classes of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. The first evidence of an IceCube point source was a blazar detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), TXS ~0506+056. Previous analyses have ruled out GeV-bright blazars as the predominant contributor to the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux under simple correlation assumptions about the relationship between the fluxes of gamma rays and neutrinos. We present results from a more general and more sensitive search for correlation between neutrinos and GeV-selected AGN using improvements in the IceCube statistical methods and 13 years of data. We detect no correlation and set stringent constraints on neutrino emission by populations of GeV-detected AGN. These include constraints on the neutrino emission from subclasses of GeV-detected AGN, including BL Lacs, flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) and non-blazar AGN, using stacking analyses testing a variety of hypothesized relationships between neutrino and gamma-ray flux. We also present results from an analysis that is sensitive to a wider range of relationships between the gamma-ray and neutrino signal.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Results from IceCube Follow-up of Nearby Supernova SN2023ixf</strong>, Alicia Mand et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07097v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07097v1</a></p>

<p>Core-collapse supernovae are of particular interest in multi-messenger astronomy due to their potential to accelerate cosmic rays and produce high-energy neutrinos. One such supernova is the recent SN2023ixf located in M101 (the Pinwheel Galaxy). It is the closest (6.4 Mpc) and brightest (B band magnitude 10.8) core-collapse supernova in nearly a decade. This supernova likely had a progenitor surrounded by dense circumstellar material which, during the supernova, may have produced neutrinos when ejecta collided with the material. I will present results of a follow-up of this supernova using data collected from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory located at the South Pole. We obtain results consistent with background expectations with time-integrated energy flux ($E^2 dN/dE$) upper limits of 0.35 GeV/cm$^2$ for a 32-day time window and 0.44 GeV/cm$^2$ for a 4-day time window, both at 90% confidence level for an $E^{-2}$ power law. These correspond to values of $2.7 \times 10^{48}$ erg for the 32-day time window and $3.5 \times 10^{48}$ erg for the 4-day time window at the supernova.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Search for GeV-PeV neutrinos from nova T Coronae Borealis with IceCube</strong>, Jessie Thwaites et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07096v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07096v1</a></p>

<p>The widely anticipated outburst of recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), which is near the end of its 80-year cycle, provides an excellent opportunity to search for neutrinos from novae. Novae are an energetic class of transients, which have been studied for hundreds of years. Because many of them are located nearby, novae provide an excellent astrophysical laboratory to study shock-powered emission in our own backyard. Several recent novae have previously been detected in GeV gamma rays, and the 2021 outburst of RS Ophiuchi was detected up to TeV energies, with evidence for a hadronic origin of the observed emission. Previous searches for GeV-TeV neutrinos from novae, predicted to occur alongside their gamma-ray emission, have been performed using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. However, no significant neutrino signals from novae have yet been observed. We present plans for follow-up of T CrB in real time with IceCube, using datasets spanning GeV to PeV neutrino energies. Due to its closer distance and higher optical flux, which has been well measured in two historical eruptions, the expected neutrino signal from T CrB is several times stronger than that from RS Ophiuchi. Furthermore, T CrB is located in the Northern sky at a declination where IceCube’s sensitivity is an additional factor of a few better than at the location of RS Ophiuchi, which is beneficial to this search.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Lifetime study of the ColdADC for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment</strong>, Wenjie Wu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07086v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07086v1</a></p>

<p>ColdADC is a custom ASIC digitizer implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology using specialized techniques for long-term reliability in cryogenic environments. ColdADC was developed for use in the DUNE Far Detector complex, which will consist of four liquid argon time projection chambers. Each contains 17 kilotons liquid argon as the target material in order to measure neutrino oscillations. Approximately 40,000 ColdADC ASICs will be installed for DUNE in the first two large detectors and will be operated at cryogenic temperatures during the experiment without replacement. The lifetime of the ColdADC is a critical parameter affecting the data quality and physics sensitivity of the experiment. A measurement of the lifetime of the ColdADC was carried out, and the results shown in this paper assure orders of magnitude longer lifetime of the ColdADC than the planned operation time of the detectors.</p>

<p>The LHAASO collaboration has recently released the spectrum and the angular distribution of the gamma-ray Galactic diffuse emission from 1 TeV to 1 PeV measured with the Kilometer-2 Array (KM2A) and the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We show that those data are in remarkably good agreement with a set of pre-existing models that assume the emission to be produced by the Galactic population of cosmic rays if its spectral shape traces that measured by CALET, DAMPE as well as KASCADE at higher energies. No extra-components besides the CR sea is needed to explain LHAASO results. Spatial dependent CR transport models, although not required to reproduce LHAASO results, are in better agreement with them respect to conventional ones and needed to consistently reproduce Fermi-LAT and neutrino data.</p>

<p>We present preliminary results on an updated full-sky analysis of the cosmic-ray arrival direction distribution with data collected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory and IceCube Neutrino Observatory with complementary field of views covering a large fraction of the sky. This study extends the energy range to higher energies. The HAWC Observatory, located at 19$^{\circ}$N has analyzed 8 years of cosmic-ray data over an energy range between 3.0 TeV and 1.0 PeV and confirms an energy-dependent anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays seen by other experiments. Combined with recently published results from IceCube with 12 years of data, the combined sky maps with 93\% coverage of the sky – between 70$^{\circ}$N and 90$^{\circ}$S – and the corresponding angular power spectra largely eliminate biases that result from partial sky coverage.</p>

<p>The IceCube Upgrade, currently under construction at the geographic South Pole, is the next development stage of the IceCube detector. It will consist of seven new columns of novel optical sensors and advanced calibration devices densely deployed at the centre of the existing array. The sensors are frozen into the ice in boreholes created by hot water drilling. The refreezing forms hole ice around modules with optical properties that differ from the surrounding glacial ice. A key objective of the IceCube Upgrade is to enhance our understanding of the optical properties of both bulk ice and refrozen hole ice. Precise ice modelling is crucial for the directional reconstruction of TeV-PeV neutrinos, as resolutions at such high energies can be strongly impacted by uncertainties in ice properties and optical sensor response. An improved directional reconstruction performance will translate to a boost in neutrino source sensitivities using IceCube data collected over the last 12 years. In this contribution, we present the expected improvements in reconstruction performance resulting from advances in hole-ice modelling and the resulting impact on IceCube’s sensitivity to astrophysical neutrino sources across three distinct event samples.</p>

<p>While high-energy astrophysical neutrinos are well-established, their flavor composition remains relatively unconstrained. In IceCube, long muon tracks from $\nu_\mu$ charged-current interactions are easily identified but the detector geometry does not allow sufficient resolution to distinguish cascade-type events. The Neutron Echo - a delayed light signal in the detector from neutron capture and de-excitation - can probe the shower’s hadronic content and thus the underlying interaction. A significant background arises from late PMT afterpulses, which are temporally coincident with the physics signal. The traditional IceCube data acquisition system has a limited readout window with significant deadtime between triggers, which is insufficient to capture the late pulses. A recently developed deadtime-free readout mode, with an extended window, enables their detection. An observed excess in the delayed time spectrum over the background would be compatible with the Neutron Echo hypothesis. In this contribution, we summarize the physics scope of delayed signals, discuss the timing spectrum of signal and PMT background, highlight the capabilities of the new system for recording late pulses, and emphasize the potential of IceCube for particle identification through delayed signals.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Improvements in the Reconstruction of IceCube Realtime Alerts</strong>, Giacomo Sommani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06957v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06957v1</a></p>

<p>In 2016, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory launched its realtime program. When a neutrino candidate of likely astrophysical origin is detected, a public alert is issued, typically within one minute. These alerts allow the astrophysical community to follow up on the region of the sky where the neutrino likely originated. Initially, the system issued around six track-signature alerts per year, with a highlight being IceCube-170922A, which was later associated with the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056. Since 2019, IceCube has expanded the selection criteria for neutrino candidates, increasing the track alert rate to around 30 per year with additional alerts for cascade signatures of probable astrophysical origin implemented in 2020. This work describes several improvements in the reconstruction of track alerts, which were introduced into the realtime stream in 2024, and details the two algorithms that are alternately used for reconstruction, depending on the reconstructed muon energy. The improvements result in more precise directional localizations, with a factor of 5 (4) reduction in the 50% (90%) contour area. Systematic errors affecting the reconstructions, such as the ice model or the geometry of the detector, have also been investigated to ensure statistical coverage. In addition to its application in the realtime stream, the improvements described here are also being applied to historical alerts with an updated catalog of track alerts forthcoming.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Inverse Seesaw Model in Non-holomorphic Modular $A_4$ Flavor Symmetry</strong>, Xianshuo Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06945v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06945v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate an inverse seesaw model of neutrino masses based on non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry, by extending the framework of modular-invariant flavor models beyond the conventional holomorphic paradigm. After establishing the general theoretical framework, we analyze three concrete model realizations distinguished by their $A_4$ representation assignments and modular weight configurations for the matter fields. Focusing on these three specific realizations, we perform a comprehensive analysis of neutrino phenomenology. By constraining the modulus parameter $\tau$ to the fundamental domain and systematically scanning the parameter space, we identify regions compatible with current neutrino oscillation data. Our numerical results provide predictions for currently unmeasured quantities, including the absolute neutrino mass scale, Dirac CP-violating phase, and Majorana phases. These predictions establish specific, testable signatures for upcoming neutrino experiments, particularly in neutrinoless double beta decay and precision oscillation measurements. The framework offers a well-defined target for future experimental verification or exclusion, while demonstrating the phenomenological viability of non-holomorphic modular symmetry approaches to flavor structure.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Search for High Energy Neutrinos from Infrared Flares</strong>, Teresa Pernice et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06934v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06934v1</a></p>

<p>IceCube has detected a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos, whose origin still remains uncertain. Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been proposed as plausible sources of neutrinos. Candidate sources include AT2019dsg, which is likely a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), and AT2019dfr, an AGN flare. Both present delayed emission in the IR band with respect to the optical signal. This emission can be interpreted as the reprocessing of X-rays to optical light of the flare by dust located in a torus around the SMBH. An additional study using an optically detected sample of 63 accretion flares revealed another candidate as a potential high-energy neutrino counterpart: AT2019aalc, which is also accompanied by a dust echo. However, follow-up stacking analysis of the 63 nuclear flares using the full IceCube data sample did not show any significant excess over background. Motivated by these three suggested neutrino-TDE correlations, we analyze a more extensive catalog of IR flares, 823 dust-echo-like flares identified using WISE satellite data, against the IceCube 10-year sample of track events from the Northern Sky. Our analysis aims to perform sensitivity studies and assess the potential detectability of neutrino emission from these types of accretion flares. In addition, we carry out a correlation study of the 823 dust echo-like flares against a revised catalog of IceCube high-purity astrophysical alerts, and reevaluate the previous study of 63 nuclear flares against the same revised alerts sample.</p>

<p>Astrophysical neutrinos provide crucial insights into their sources and play a key role in multi-messenger astronomy. The neutrino flavor composition at Earth allows us to probe the mechanisms of neutrino production and cosmic ray acceleration, as well as the properties of the environments in which they originate. Understanding the flavor composition also offers a unique opportunity to test new physics in the neutrino sector. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory consists of 1 km$^3$ of ice instrumented with photomultipliers that detect neutrinos through Cherenkov radiation from their interaction products. Different neutrino interactions result in distinct event topologies, such as tracks, cascades, and double cascade events, which allow for the identification of the interacting neutrino type and measurement of the flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrino flux. In this contribution we present the results of the measurement of the flavor ratio of the High-Energy Starting Event Selection based on 12 years of data, a high-purity sample of neutrino interactions that occur inside the detector. In addition, we discuss various methods that could further improve the analysis in the future.</p>

<p>Recently, IceCube has observed an excess of astrophysical neutrinos from the Galactic plane. Such a signal may indicate the presence of individual sources or a diffuse neutrino flux from the interactions of Galactic, hadronic cosmic rays. We consider the prospect of neutrino production in galactic X-ray binary systems. A model for neutrino production in the variable jets of these systems is discussed, and how such information may be incorporated within searches for astrophysical neutrinos from these sources. Two ongoing studies are presented on behalf of the IceCube Collaboration using 13 years of cascades and track-like events. In the first study, recently published model predictions are used to motivate the analysis of five selected black-hole X-ray binaries. Gamma-ray data from Fermi-LAT, as well as X-ray data from Swift/BAT and MAXI are used to search for temporal correlations between radiative cycles of the disk-jet system and potential neutrino emission. In the second study, a wider selection of variable X-ray binaries and their Swift/BAT light curves is considered and a stacking search is used to constrain the contribution of this source population to the Galactic neutrino flux.</p>

<p>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect radio signals from extensive air showers (EAS) caused by ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic particles. Galactic, hardware-like, and anthropogenic noise are expected to contaminate these signals. To address this problem, we propose training a supervised convolutional network known as an encoder-decoder. This network is used to learn a coded representation of the data and remove specific features from it. This denoiser is trained using high-fidelity air shower simulations specifically tailored to replicate the characteristics of signals detected by GRAND. In this contribution, we describe our machine-learning model and report initial results demonstrating the sensitivity enhancement resulting from our denoising algorithm when applied to realistically simulated GRAND signals with varying signal-to-noise ratios.</p>

<p>Characterizing the astrophysical neutrino flux with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory traditionally relies on a binned forward-folding likelihood approach. Insufficient Monte Carlo (MC) statistics in each bin limits the granularity and dimensionality of the binning scheme. A neural network can be employed to optimize a summary statistic that serves as the input for data analysis, yielding the best possible outcomes. This end-to-end optimized summary statistic allows for the inclusion of more observables while maintaining adequate MC statistics per bin. This work will detail the application of end-to-end optimized summary statistics in analyzing and characterizing the galactic neutrino flux, achieving improved resolution in the likelihood contours for selected signal parameters and models.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Calculation of the exposure of GRANDProto300 to cosmic rays</strong>, Sei Kato et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06629v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06629v1</a></p>

<p>GRANDProto300 is one of the prototype experiments of the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection. It will feature about 300 radio antenna detectors in Xiaodushang in Dunhuang, China, covering a total geometrical area of about 200 km$^2$. A main scientific goal of GRANDProto300 is the study of cosmic rays in the transition region ($10^{17}\, {\rm eV} &lt; E &lt; 10^{18.5}\, {\rm eV}$). Our study calculates the exposure of GRANDProto300 to cosmic rays and estimates the number of cosmic-ray events to be detected during a fixed observation period. The trigger efficiency reaches 50, 80, and 90% at $10^{17.5}$, $10^{17.9}$, and $10^{18.3}\, {\rm eV}$, respectively. The exposure of GRANDProto300 is 50 km$^2$ day sr at around $10^{17.5}$ eV, and the expected number of observed cosmic rays with energies above $10^{17}$ eV and zenith angles above 65$^{\circ}$ is about 130 events per day. GRANDProto300 will be able to measure the cosmic-ray energy spectrum in $10^{17.2}\, {\rm eV} &lt; E &lt; 10^{19.5}\, {\rm eV}$ through one-year observation, with a statistical precision about five times better than the previous spectral measurement by a mono-fluorescence detector of the Telescope Array Low-Energy Extension. The statistical uncertainty in the measurement of the mean depth of the air-shower maximum $X_{\rm max}$ is about five times better than the previous measurements using radio detectors at $10^{17.5}$ eV; systematic uncertainties should be a dominant contribution limiting our interpretation of the chemical composition of cosmic rays in the transition region.</p>

<p>The detection of transient phenomena such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares, novae, and supernovae, alongside novel cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves, has transformed astrophysics in recent years. Maximizing the discovery potential of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous detections, requires a tool that rapidly compiles and contextualizes relevant information for each new event. We present Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge.   Astro-COLIBRI integrates a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly clients (a website and mobile apps for iOS and Android). It processes astronomical alerts from multiple streams in real time, filtering them based on user-defined criteria and placing them in their multi-wavelength and multi-messenger context. The platform offers intuitive data visualization, a quick summary of relevant event properties, and an assessment of observing conditions at numerous observatories worldwide.   We here describe its architecture, data resources, and main functionalities. We highlight the automatic collection of photometric data from a variety of large scale optical surveys, a recently added feature that significantly improves the capabilities of the Astro-COLIBRI platform.</p>

<p>This work introduces a model for lepton mass generation and flavor mixing, realized through a (2,3) inverse seesaw structure within a modular ( S_4 ) symmetry framework. The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near ( \delta_{\rm CP} \sim 359^\circ ), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass ( |m_{ee}| \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \,\text{eV} ), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular ( S_4 )-based ISS(2,3) framework.</p>

<p>Many models of dark matter QCD axion requires inflation at a scale $H_{\text{inf}} \lesssim 10^{6}$~GeV and hence does not allow for a detectable tensor mode fluctuation. This is because the domain wall problem forces the Peccei–Quinn symmetry to be broken during the inflation and the axions to be produced by the misalignment mechanism. We point out that theories with multiple axions can evade this constraint and allow for a high-scale inflation with detectable tensor mode. It only requires a condition on the anomaly coefficients so that there is a unique minimum for the axion potential without a fine-tuning or small parameters.</p>

<p>In fuzzy dark matter scenarios, the quantum wave nature of ultralight axion-like particles generates stochastic density fluctuations inside dark matter halos. These fluctuations, known as granules, perturb the orbits of subhalos and other orbiting bodies. While previous studies have simulated these effects using N-body techniques or modeled them statistically using diffusion approximations, we propose an alternative framework based on representing the perturbations as a Fourier series with random coefficients, which can be applied to individual orbits, not just populations. We extend the model to finite-size subhalos, identifying a critical length scale below which subhalos behave as point-mass particles. In contrast, larger subhalos exhibit suppressed perturbations from granules due to their extended mass profiles. Using FDM-Simulator, we validate our finite-size model by isolating granule accelerations and confirming their statistical effects on subhalo dynamics.</p>

<p>The LIGO Scientific, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration has identified two binary neutron star merger candidates, GW170817 and GW190425, along with several binary black hole candidates. While GW170817 was confirmed as a BNS merger through its electromagnetic counterparts, GW190425 lacked such observations, leaving its classification uncertain. We examine the possibility that GW190425 originated from black holes that merged after dark matter accretion caused their progenitor neutron stars to implode. Using this event, we place constraints on dark matter parameters, such as its mass and interaction cross section. We simulate GW190425-like events and analyze them using future gravitational wave detector networks, including upcoming upgrades to current detector networks and next-generation observatories. We show that a network with A+ sensitivity can not classify a GW190425-like event with sufficient confidence. Detector networks with A# sensitivity can classify such events only if the neutron stars follow a relatively stiff equation of state, whose stronger tidal imprint differs measurably from a binary black hole waveform. Next-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer recover the tidal signature even for soft, compact stars, enabling confident classification. Finally, we forecast the dark matter constraints that future gravitational wave networks could achieve for similar events.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>Baryonification: An alternative to hydrodynamical simulations for cosmological studies</strong>, Aurel Schneider et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07892v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07892v1</a></p>

<p>We present an improved baryonification (BFC) model that modifies dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations to generate particle-level outputs for gas, dark matter, and stars. Unlike previous implementations, our approach first splits each simulation particle into separate dark matter and baryonic components, which are then displaced individually using the BFC technique. By applying the hydrostatic and ideal gas equations, we assign pressure and temperature values to individual gas particles. The model is validated against hydrodynamical simulations from the FLAMINGO and TNG suites (which feature varied feedback prescriptions) showing good agreement at the level of density and pressure profiles across a wide range of halo masses. As a further step, we calibrate the BFC model parameters to gas and stellar mass ratio profiles from the hydrodynamical simulations. Based on these calibrations, we baryonify $N$-body simulations and compare the resulting total matter power spectrum suppressions to the ones from the same hydrodynamical simulation. Carrying out this test of the BFC method at each redshift individually, we obtain a 2 percent agreement up to $k=5\,h$/Mpc across all tested feedback scenarios. We also define a reduced, 2+1 parameter BFC model that simultaneously accounts for feedback variations (2 parameters) and redshift evolution (1 parameter). The 2+1 parameter model agrees with the hydrodynamical simulations to better than 2.5 percent over the scales and redshifts relevant for cosmological surveys. Finally, we present a map-level comparison between a baryonified $N$-body simulation and a full hydrodynamical run from the TNG simulation suite. Visual inspection of dark matter, gas, and stellar density fields, along with the integrated pressure map, shows promising agreement. Further work is needed to quantify the accuracy at the level of observables.</p>

<p>Recent observations of DESI hint that dark matter (DM) may not be cold but have a non-zero equation of state (EoS) parameter, and that dark energy (DE) may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero DM EoS parameter within the framework of dynamical DE. We perform analysis by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova (SN) data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. When using the combination of CMB, BAO, and SN data, our results indicate a preference for a non-zero DM EoS parameter at the $2.8\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$ level within the content of a constant DE EoS. In contrast, for a time-evolving DE EoS parameterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, this preference decreases to $0.8\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$. Furthermore, allowing a non-zero DM EoS yields best-fit values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ that exhibit smaller deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM expectations, and Bayesian evidence analysis shows a comparable preference for this model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. The overall results of this work indicate that a non-zero DM EoS parameter warrants further exploration and investigation.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>Constraints on Axion-Like Particles from 16.5 Years of Fermi-LAT Data and Prospects for VLAST</strong>, Zhi-Qi Guo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07786v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07786v1</a></p>

<p>Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical particles beyond the Standard Model, are considered as promising dark matter candidates. ALPs can convert into photons and vice versa in a magnetic field via the Primakoff effect, potentially generating detectable oscillation in $\gamma$-ray spectra. This study analyzes 16.5 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) on NGC 1275, the brightest galaxy in the Perseus cluster, to constrain the ALP parameter space. Our results improve the previous 95\% exclusion limits of the photon-ALP coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ by a factor of 2 in the ALP mass range of $4\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Moreover, we investigate the projected sensitivity of the future Very Large Area $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) on searching for ALPs. We find that (i) the expected sensitivity on the ALP-photon coupling can be stronger than that from the upcoming International Axion Observatory (IAXO) in the ALP mass range of $2\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 1\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$, with the best sensitivity of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 7\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ at $m_{a}\sim 2\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}$; (ii) VLAST can extend the sensitivity of the ALP masses below $5\times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$, where the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim 1.5\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ will be excluded; (iii) the entire parameter space of ALP accounting for TeV transparency can be fully tested. These results demonstrate that VLAST will offer an excellent opportunity for ALPs searches.</p>

<p>We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by the ringdown phase of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. As the ringdown signal is independent of the PBH formation mechanism, the resulting SGWB offers a model-independent probe of PBHs. We numerically compute the ringdown waveform and derive the corresponding SGWB. We show that such a signal could be detected by future pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) for PBHs heavier than the solar mass. Additionally, we evaluate the SGWB from binary PBH mergers and demonstrate that it lies within the sensitivity bands of next-generation ground-based interferometers such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, suggesting a multi-band observational strategy for probing the PBH dark matter scenario.</p>

<p>2025-07-10, <strong>Probing Axions via Spectroscopic Measurements of S-stars at the Galactic Center</strong>, Zhaoyu Bai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07482v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07482v1</a></p>

<p>Axions, encompassing both QCD axions and axion-like particles, can generate loop-induced quadratic couplings to electromagnetic field strength tensors, resulting in oscillatory shifts of the fine-structure constant. Near a Kerr black hole, an axion field with a Compton wavelength comparable to the event horizon can exponentially grow through the superradiance mechanism, potentially reaching a maximum amplitude near the decay constant, provided this scale is below approximately $10^{16}$ GeV. The saturated axion cloud formed around the black hole induces characteristic oscillations in the fine-structure constant, with a period of $10$-$40$ minutes determined by the axion mass, and a spatial profile governed by the axion wavefunction and its coupling strength. At lower axion masses, axion dark matter can form a soliton-like core characterized by a nearly constant amplitude, extending measurable variations of the fine-structure constant to greater distances. Precise spectroscopic measurements of S-stars orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr A$^*$ provide a powerful probe of these predictions, potentially excluding substantial regions of parameter space for quadratic scalar couplings to photons, owing to the high boson density near the Galactic Center.</p>

<p>The DarkSide-20k dark matter direct detection experiment will employ a 21 m^2 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array, instrumenting a dual-phase 50 tonnes liquid argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC). SiPMs are arranged into modular photosensors called Tiles, each integrating 24 SiPMs onto a printed circuit board (PCB) that provides signal amplification, power distribution, and a single-ended output for simplified readout. 16 Tiles are further grouped into Photo-Detector Units (PDUs). This paper details the production of the Tiles and the quality assurance and quality control (QA-QC) protocol established to ensure their performance and uniformity. The production and QA-QC of the Tiles are carried out at Nuova Officina Assergi (NOA), an ISO-6 clean room facility at LNGS. This process includes wafer-level cryogenic characterisation, precision flip-chip bonding, wire bonding, and extensive electrical and optical validation of each Tile. The overall production yield exceeds 83.5%, matching the requirements of the DarkSide-20k production plan. These results validate the robustness of the Tile design and its suitability for operation in a cryogenic environment.</p>

<p>Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \le 60$ deg, $10 \le |b| \le 60$ deg) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a sharp peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which does not depend on GALPROP or other model templates. The halo excess can be fitted by the annihilation spectrum with a mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo’’ remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.</p>

<p>In the heterodyne approach to axion detection, axion dark matter induces transitions between two modes of a microwave cavity, resulting in a parametrically enhanced signal power. We describe the fabrication and characterization of a prototype normal conducting cavity specifically optimized for heterodyne detection. Corrugations on the cavity walls support linearly polarized hybrid modes which maximize the signal power while strongly suppressing noise. We demonstrate tuning mechanisms which allow one mode’s frequency to be scanned across a 4 MHz range, while suppressing cross-coupling noise by at least 80 dB. A future superconducting cavity with identical geometry to our prototype would have the potential to probe orders of magnitude beyond astrophysical bounds.</p>

<p>We propose the use of several unconventional materials as detectors for dark matter with mass beneath the MeV scale. These include the transition-metal dichalcogenide TiSe$_2$ hosting a low-energy plasmon in the charge-density-wave phase, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ containing a low-energy acoustic demon mode, and hole-doped diamond with tunable optical and acoustic plasmon frequencies. We perform first-principles density functional theory computations of their loss functions at non-vanishing momenta and establish their reach into light dark matter parameter space. We show that due to intense low-energy plasmon modes – of different microscopic origin in each – the reach of detectors based on these materials could surpass existing proposals by several orders of magnitude for both dark matter scattering and absorption on electrons. The anisotropic response of these materials, which enables directional detection, renders them exceptionally strong detector candidates, motivating the design and fabrication of future devices.</p>

<p>We consider a simple Higgs portal dark matter (DM) model, where the Standard Model is extended with a complex singlet scalar. The imaginary part of the scalar becomes a massive and stable pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, serving as the DM candidate, while the real part gives rise to a second (dark) Higgs boson. We focus on the freeze-in production of the DM, paying particular attention to low-reheating temperature scenarios, where the dark Higgs can be a long-lived particle (LLP). We also explore the phenomenology of this dark Higgs at the LHC and the Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron mode, discussing its discovery prospects in regions of parameter space consistent with current DM constraints. Our results emphasize the impact of the cosmic reheating dynamics on the DM freeze-in production and their critical role in interpreting collider signatures. Furthermore, our findings suggest that LLP searches may provide insights into the fundamental dynamics of reheating.</p>

<p>We propose two novel solutions to the domain wall problem of the QCD axion by introducing a massless or light axion that also couples to gluons. The first solution applies when the new axion forms strings after inflation. Due to its mixing with the QCD axion, domain walls of the QCD axion are bounded by these strings and confined into cosmologically safe string bundles. This scenario predicts the existence of such string bundles, which may survive until today and leave observable signatures, such as gravitational waves, cosmic birefringence, and CMB anisotropies. The simultaneous detection of the QCD axion and any of these cosmological signatures would serve as a smoking-gun signal. The second solution assumes a homogeneous initial condition for the new axion. If it is sufficiently light, its potential temporarily induces a bias in the QCD axion potential before the onset of oscillations, rendering the domain walls unstable. In both scenarios, the Peccei-Quinn mechanism remains effective, and the strong CP problem is not reintroduced. We identify the viable parameter regions and discuss the resulting dark matter abundance.</p>

<p>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a solar mass compact object is whirling around a supermassive black hole, act as precise tracers of the spacetime geometry and astrophysical environment around the supermassive black hole. These systems are highly sensitive to even the smallest deviations from the vacuum general relativity scenario. However, detecting these signals requires highly accurate waveform modeling up to the first post-adiabatic order, incorporating self-force effects, system parameters, and environmental influences. In this paper, we focus on the impact of dark matter on gravitational waveforms. Cold dark matter in galactic centers can be redistributed by the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole, forming a dense, spike-like profile. When an EMRI evolves in such an environment, the interaction between the binary and the surrounding dark matter can leave distinctive imprints on the emitted waveform, and thus offer a novel way to probe the nature and distribution of dark matter. We specifically examine how dark matter modifies the background spacetime. By treating these modifications perturbatively, we present a framework to incorporate dark matter environmental effects into gravitational waveform modeling at the first post-adiabatic order.</p>

<p>While cosmic voids are now recognized as a valuable cosmological probe, identifying them in a galaxy catalog is challenging for multiple reasons: observational effects such as holes in the mask or magnitude selection hinder the detection process; galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution; and it is non-trivial to estimate the detection significance and parameter uncertainties for individual voids. Our goal is to extract a catalog of voids from constrained simulations of the large-scale structure that are consistent with the observed galaxy positions, effectively representing statistically independent realizations of the probability distribution of the cosmic web. This allows us to carry out a full Bayesian analysis of the structures emerging in the Universe. We use 50 posterior realizations of the large-scale structure in the Manticore-Local suite, obtained from the 2M++ galaxies. Running the VIDE void finder on each realization, we extract 50 independent void catalogs. We perform a posterior clustering analysis to identify high-significance voids at the 5$\sigma$ level, and we assess the probability distribution of their properties. We produce a catalog of 100 voids with high statistical significance, available at https://voids.cosmictwin.org/, including the probability distributions of the centers and radii of the voids. We characterize the morphology of these regions, effectively producing a template for density environments that can be used in astrophysical applications such as galaxy evolution studies. While providing the community with a detailed catalog of voids in the nearby Universe, this work also constitutes an approach to identifying cosmic voids from galaxy surveys that allows us to account rigorously for the observational systematics intrinsic to direct detection, and provide a Bayesian characterization of their properties.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>The Bispectrum of Intrinsic Alignments: II. Precision Comparison Against Dark Matter Simulations</strong>, Thomas Bakx et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06818v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06818v1</a></p>

<p>We measure three-dimensional bispectra of halo intrinsic alignments (IA) and dark matter overdensities in real space from N-body simulations for halos of mass $10^{12}-10^{12.5} M_\odot /h$. We show that their multipoles with respect to the line of sight can be accurately described by a tree-level perturbation theory model on large scales ($k\lesssim 0.11\,h$/Mpc) at $z=0$. For these scales and in a simulation volume of 1 Gpc/$h$, we detect the bispectrum monopole $B_{\delta\delta E}^{00}$ at $\sim 30\sigma$ and the two quadrupoles $B_{\delta \delta E}^{11}$ and $B_{\delta \delta E}^{20}$ at $\sim 25\sigma$ and $\sim 15\sigma$, respectively. We also report similar detection significances for the lowest order multipoles of $B_{\delta EE}$ and $B_{EEE}$, although these are largely driven by stochastic contributions. We show that the first and second order EFT parameters are consistent with those obtained from fitting the IA power spectrum analysis at next-to-leading order, without requiring any priors to break degeneracies for the quadratic bias parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of higher multipole moments of $B_{\delta\delta E}$ greatly reduces the errors on second order bias parameters, by factors of 5 or more. The IA bispectrum thus provides an effective means of determining higher order shape bias parameters, thereby characterizing the scale dependence of the IA signal. We also detect parity-odd bispectra such as $B_{\delta \delta B}$ and $B_{\delta EB}$ at $\sim 10 \sigma$ significance or more for $k&lt;0.15\,h$/Mpc and they are fully consistent with the parity-even sector. Furthermore, we check that the Gaussian covariance approximation works reasonably well on the scales we consider here. These results lay the groundwork for using the bispectrum of IA in cosmological analyses.</p>

<p>Monopoles have been a subject of much theoretical and experimental research since they were proposed to symmetrize Maxwells equations. However, no experimental signature of their existence has been detected. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this lack of success. In here we generalize QED to a two photon theory where the magnetic photon and the monopole belong to dark matter. A naive mixing interaction produces duality and generates experimental consequences for indirect monopole detection via the magnetic charge of the electron.</p>

<p>The Dark MAtter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) instrument is a space-born cosmic-ray detector, capable of measuring ion fluxes up to $\sim$500 TeV/n. This energy scale is made accessible through its calorimeter, which is the deepest currently operating in orbit. Saturation of the calorimeter readout channels start occurring above $\sim$100 TeV of incident energy, and can significantly affect the primary energy reconstruction. Different techniques, analytical and machine-learning based, have been developed to tackle this issue, focusing on the recovery of single-bar deposits, up to several hundreds of TeV. In this work, a new machine-learning technique is presented, which profit of a unique model to correct the total deposited energy in DAMPE calorimeter. The described method is able to generalise its corrections for different ions and extend the maximum detectable incident energy to the PeV scale.</p>

<p>We present a novel method to efficiently search for long-duration gravitational wave transients emitted by new-born neutron star remnants of binary neutron star coalescences or supernovae. The detection of these long-transient gravitational waves would contribute to the understanding of the properties of neutron stars and fundamental physics. Additionally, studying gravitational waves emitted by neutron stars can provide valuable tests of general relativity and offer insights into the neutron star population, of which only a small fraction appears to be observable through current electromagnetic telescopes. Our approach uses GPUs and the JAX library in Python, resulting in significantly faster processing compared to previous methods. The efficiency of this code enables wide regions of the sky to be covered, eliminating the need for precise pinpointing of mergers or supernovae. This method will be deployed in searches for long-transient gravitational waves following any detection of a binary neutron star system merger in the latest O4 science run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, which started in May 2023 with a significant improvement in sensitivity with respect to previous runs.</p>

<p>Recent observations of DESI hint that dark matter (DM) may not be cold but have a non-zero equation of state (EoS) parameter, and that dark energy (DE) may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero DM EoS parameter within the framework of dynamical DE. We perform analysis by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova (SN) data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. When using the combination of CMB, BAO, and SN data, our results indicate a preference for a non-zero DM EoS parameter at the $2.8\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$ level within the content of a constant DE EoS. In contrast, for a time-evolving DE EoS parameterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, this preference decreases to $0.8\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$. Furthermore, allowing a non-zero DM EoS yields best-fit values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ that exhibit smaller deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM expectations, and Bayesian evidence analysis shows a comparable preference for this model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. The overall results of this work indicate that a non-zero DM EoS parameter warrants further exploration and investigation.</p>

<p>We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks, cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents and implements a Planning &amp; Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases, writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>The Unhurried Universe: A Continued Search for Long Term Variability in ASAS-SN</strong>, Sydney Petz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07174v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07174v1</a></p>

<p>We search a sample of 5,685,060 isolated sources in the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) with 14.5&lt;g&lt;15 mag for slowly varying sources with brightness changes larger than ~0.03 mag/year over 10 years. We find 426 slowly-varying systems. Of these systems, 200 are identified as variables for the first time, 226 are previously classified as variables, and we find equal numbers of sources becoming brighter and fainter. Previously classified systems were mostly identified as semi-regular variables (SR), slow irregular variables (L), or unknown (MISC or VAR), as long time scale variability does not fit into a standard class. Much like Petz &amp; Kochanek 2025, the sources are scattered across the color magnitude diagram and can be placed into 5 groups that exhibit distinct behaviors. There are also six AGN. There are 262 candidates (~62 percent) that also show shorter time scale periodic variability, mostly with periods longer than 10 days. The variability of 66 of these candidates may be related to dust. Combining the new slow variable candidates with the candidates from Petz &amp; Kochanek 2025, we have found a total of 1206 slow variables.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Investigating the CREDIT history of supernova remnants as cosmic-ray sources</strong>, Anton Stall et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07088v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07088v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been suspected to be the primary sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Over the past decades, great strides have been made in the modelling of particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification, and escape from SNRs. Yet while many SNRs have been observed in nonthermal emission in radio, X-rays, and gamma rays, there is no evidence for any individual object contributing to the locally observed flux. Here, we propose a particular spectral signature from individual remnants that is due to the energy-dependent escape from SNRs. For young and nearby sources, we predict fluxes enhanced by tens of percent in narrow rigidity intervals; given the percent-level flux uncertainties of contemporary cosmic-ray data, such features should be readily detectable. We model the spatial and temporal distribution of sources and the resulting distribution of fluxes with a Monte Carlo approach. The decision tree that we have trained on simulated data is able to discriminate with very high significance between the null hypothesis of a smooth distribution of sources and the scenario with a stochastic distribution of individual sources. We suggest that this cosmic-ray energy-dependent injection time (CREDIT) scenario be considered in experimental searches to identify individual SNRs as cosmic-ray sources.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Model-independent observational constraints with fast radio bursts</strong>, L. L. Sales et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06975v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06975v1</a></p>

<p>This study employs well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) to constrain cosmological parameters using two model-independent methods: the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ with an artificial neural network and cosmography. By integrating FRB data with type Ia supernovae (SNe), BAO from DESI DR2, and cosmic chronometers (CC), we derive constraints on the Hubble constant ($H_0$), deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and jerk parameter ($j_0$). For the reconstruction method, our MCMC analysis with FRB-only provides $H_0 = 69.9 \pm 5.8 \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to a precision of $\sim 8\%$. A joint analysis with FRB+SNe+DESI gives $H_0 = 68.85_{-0.48}^{+0.47} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, reaching a precision below 1\%. The cosmographic approach with FRBs alone provides $H_0 = 65.83_{-4.87}^{+3.77} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.45_{-0.31}^{+0.26}$, and $j_0 = 1.17_{-0.58}^{+0.70}$ with a precision for the Hubble constant of $\sim 6\%$. Besides, the DESI DR2 dataset yields $H_0 = 65.20_{-1.28}^{+1.29} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.29\pm 0.07$, and $j_0 = 0.58_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$, indicating an accuracy of $\sim 2\%$ for the Hubble constant. Combining the FRB, SNe, DESI, and CC datasets provide tighter constraints, e.g., $H_0 = 67.88_{-0.53}^{+0.52} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.42_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$, and $j_0 = 0.56 \pm 0.02$. Notably, these findings provide a statistically significant indication of deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction of $j_0 = 1$, suggesting possible departures from standard cosmology at a $1\sigma$ confidence level. They also confirm a model-independent accelerated expansion ($q_0 &lt; 0$), demonstrating the potential of FRBs as valuable cosmological probes.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Giants, Supergiants and Hypergiants</strong>, Lee R. Patrick et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06970v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06970v1</a></p>

<p>Observing the stars in our night sky tells us that giant, supergiant and hypergiant stars hold an unique importance in the understanding of stellar populations. Theoretical stellar models predict a rich tapestry of evolved stars. These evolved stars result in supernova explosions for massive stars and the shedding of the outer layers of low- and intermediate-mass stars to form white dwarf stars. Stars on these pathways provide elemental and kinematic feedback that shapes their host galaxies and synthesize the elements that we observe in the Universe today. Observational surveys in the Milky Way and the Local Group of galaxies shape our physical understanding of stellar evolution. Hypergiant stars represent stellar evolution at the extremes, displaying evidence of intense stellar winds combined with luminosities and radii that are unrivalled. Supergiant stars are used as elemental beacons in distant galaxies, and supergiants that cross the Cepheid variable instability strip can be used as rulers to measure the scale of our Universe. The overwhelming majority of stars in the Milky Way will become giant stars. Giants are hundreds of times larger and thousands of times more luminous than the Sun, which makes them excellent tracers of stellar structure. In this chapter, I describe the observational and theoretical manifestations of stellar evolution at various stages and masses. I highlight evolutionary connections between evolved products and comment on their eventual endpoints.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Measuring the initial mass of 44Ti in SN 1987A through the 44Sc emission line</strong>, Roberta Giuffrida et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06832v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06832v1</a></p>

<p>Context. Deriving the mass and large-scale asymmetries of radioactive isotopes offers valuable insights into the complex phases of a supernova explosion. Important examples are $^{56}$Ni, with its decay products $^{56}$Co and $^{56}$Fe, and $^{44}$Ti, which are studied through their X-rays emission lines and provide a powerful diagnostic tool to probe the explosive nucleosynthesis processes in the inner layers of the exploding star. Aims. In this framework, SN 1987A provides a privileged laboratory being the youngest supernova remnant from which the mass of Ti has been estimated. However, some tension exists in determining the initial mass of $^{44}$Ti. Previous analysis, relying on \textit{NuSTAR} and \textit{INTEGRAL} data, report $M_{44} = (1.5 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-4}$ $M_\odot$ and $M_{44}=(3.1 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{-4} M_\odot$, respectively. In this paper we estimate the initial mass of $^{44}$Ti via its decay product, the $^{44}$Sc emission line at 4.09 keV, using \textit{Chandra} observations. Methods. We perform multi-epoch spectral analysis focusing on the inner part of the remnant, to minimize the contamination from the X-ray emission stemming from the shocked plasma. As a result, we provide the detection of $^{44}$Sc emission line in the central part of SN 1987A with a $\sim$99.7\% (3 $\sigma$) significance. Results. The simultaneous fit of the spectra extracted from observations between 2016 and 2021 provides a line flux of $6.8^{+2.2}_{-2.3}\times 10^{-7}$ photons s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ corresponding to a $^{44}$Ti mass $M_{44}=(1.6\pm0.5) \times 10^{-4} M_\odot$ (errors at the $90\%$ confidence level). The results obtained with our spectral analysis seem to align with those derived with NuSTAR.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Pulsar+escape: the recipe for LHAASO sources ?</strong>, Pierrick Martin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06627v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06627v1</a></p>

<p>Observations of our Galaxy at very-high and ultra-high photon energies have revealed a rich population of sources, many of which have significant angular extension and/or are positionally coincident with energetic pulsars. We assessed whether the properties of these gamma-ray emitters are consistent with the predictions of a model for the non-thermal leptonic emission of a pulsar wind nebula expanding within a supernova remnant, including the possibility of particle escape across the different components of the system up to the ambient medium. We used a multi-zone model framework that describes the transport and radiation of a population of ultra-relativistic electron-positron pairs. The dynamics of the system is retrieved from numerical hydrodynamics simulations, which allows to follow the evolution through advanced stages. Model predictions for typical parameter setups are compared to source catalogs issued by the H.E.S.S. and LHAASO collaborations. If particles remain confined in the nebula, 1-100TeV emission is only partially consistent with the properties of observed sources in terms of surface brightness, angular extent, and photon index. In particular, the systems spend a long time in a bright and soft state that has no equivalent in observations. Conversely, including the possibility of energy-dependent particle escape across the object results in a much better agreement, both in the 1-10TeV range explored with H.E.S.S. or LHAASO-WCDA, and in the 20-100TeV range explored by LHAASO-KM2A. Emission components with intermediate to low brightnesses and large to very large sizes result from particles trapped in the remnant or escaped in the surrounding medium. Particle escape, clearly seen in the form of misaligned jets or halos around middle-aged pulsars, is a very important process in much younger systems with 1-100kyr ages, and shapes their appearance as TeV/PeV sources.</p>
