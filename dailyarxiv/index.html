<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Generation of Lognormal Synthetic Lyman-$α$ Forest Spectra for $P_{1D}$ Analysis</strong>, Meagan Herbold et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04405v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04405v1</a></p>

<p>The one-dimensional flux power spectrum (P1D) of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest probes small-scale structure in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is therefore sensitive to a variety of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. These include the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, the thermal history of the IGM, the sum of neutrino masses, and potential small-scale fluctuations due to the nature of dark matter. However, P1D is also highly sensitive to observational and instrumental systematics, making accurate synthetic spectra essential for validating analyses and quantifying these effects, especially in high-volume surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We present an efficient lognormal mock framework for generating one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectra tailored for P1D analysis. Our method captures the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted flux and the scale-dependent shape and amplitude of the one-dimensional flux power spectrum by tuning Gaussian field correlations and transformation parameters. Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \leq z \leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \leq k \leq 1.0$ s km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to sub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we discuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of astrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects. Such improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and enable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D inference and precision cosmology.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters with 10 years of data from the NOvA experiment</strong>, The NOvA Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04361v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04361v1</a></p>

<p>This Letter reports measurements of muon-neutrino disappearance and electron-neutrino appearance and the corresponding antineutrino processes between the two NOvA detectors in the NuMI neutrino beam. These measurements use a dataset with double the neutrino mode beam exposure that was previously analyzed, along with improved simulation and analysis techniques. A joint fit to these samples in the three-flavor paradigm results in the most precise single-experiment constraint on the atmospheric neutrino mass-splitting, $\Delta m^2_{32}= 2.431^{+0.036}_{-0.034} (-2.479^{+0.036}_{-0.036}) \times 10^{-3}$~eV$^2$ if the mass ordering is Normal (Inverted). In both orderings, a region close to maximal mixing with $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.55^{+0.06}_{-0.02}$ is preferred. The NOvA data show a mild preference for the Normal mass ordering with a Bayes factor of 2.4 (corresponding to 70\% of the posterior probability), indicating that the Normal ordering is 2.4 times more probable than the Inverted ordering. When incorporating a 2D $\Delta m^2_{32}\textrm{–}\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$ constraint based on Daya Bay data, this preference strengthens to a Bayes factor of 6.6 (87\%).</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>POEMMA-Balloon with Radio: An Overview</strong>, J. Eser et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04302v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04302v1</a></p>

<p>The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is an Ultra Long Duration Balloon payload scheduled for launch in Spring 2027 from Wanaka, New Zealand. It will circle over the Southern Ocean for a mission duration as long as 50 days, serving as a precursor to the dual satellite mission, Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). The PBR mission represents a significant step towards establishing a space-based multi-messenger observatory. Observations from space will enhance the statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and complement ground-based observatories by enabling simultaneous observations of both hemispheres with a single instrument. Additionally, POEMMA will facilitate the measurement of Very-High-Energy Neutrinos (VHENs) following multi-messenger alerts of astrophysical transient events, such as gamma-ray bursts. PBR is an adaptation of the POEMMA mission, featuring three primary science goals: 1. Observe Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) via the fluorescence technique from suborbital space. 2. Observe horizontal high-altitude air showers (HAHAs) with energies exceeding the cosmic ray knee (E &gt; 3 PeV) using optical and radio detection for the first time. 3. Follow astrophysical event alerts in the search for VHENs. This contribution provides an overview of the PBR payload and discusses the expected performance of its various detectors.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Neutrino absorption in two-flavor color-superconducting quark matter</strong>, Mark G. Alford et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04240v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04240v1</a></p>

<p>We calculate the absorption mean free paths of electron and muon neutrinos in two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) quark matter in the density and temperature range that is relevant to binary neutron star mergers. We model the strong interaction between quarks using a Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model, performing calculations self-consistently in the mean-field approximation. Since the 2SC gap is large we restrict our analysis to the contribution of unpaired quarks. We find that at low temperatures absorption by a down quark $\nu+d \to u+e^-/\mu^-$ is kinematically not allowed, so absorption by a strange quark $\nu+s \to u+e^-/\mu^-$ dominates the mean free path. As temperature or neutrino energy rises, the $d$ quark absorption channel becomes active, and the mean free path shrinks. We find that in equilibrated 2SC matter with an electron lepton fraction $Y_{L_e}=0.1$, the neutrinos form a degenerate gas with a mean free path of meters or less, independent of the temperature.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Cosmic-Ray Boosted Diffuse Supernova Neutrinos</strong>, Alexander Sandrock et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04229v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04229v1</a></p>

<p>The subject of boosted fluxes of dark matter or cosmic relic neutrinos via scattering on cosmic rays has received considerable attention recently. This article investigates the boosted neutrino flux from scattering of cosmic rays and the so-far undetected diffuse supernova neutrino background, taking into account both galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays. The calculated flux is many orders of magnitude smaller than either the galactic diffuse neutrino emission, the extragalactic astrophysical flux measured by IceCube, or the cosmogenic neutrino flux expected at the highest energies.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Toward precision physics tests with future COHERENT detectors</strong>, M. Atzori Corona et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04205v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04205v1</a></p>

<p>We present a comprehensive sensitivity study of future CE$\nu$NS detectors, focusing on a cryogenic cesium iodide detector and a tonne-scale liquid argon one, currently being developed by the COHERENT Collaboration. These setups will enable precision measurements of the weak mixing angle at low energies and allow accurate extraction of the neutron nuclear distribution radius. We also demonstrate that next-generation detectors will place constraints on the neutrino charge radius comparable to or better than current global fits. In addition, we explore the sensitivity to non standard neutrino electromagnetic properties, such as magnetic moments and millicharges, as well as new mediators. These findings reinforce the role of CE$\nu$NS experiments in the upcoming precision era, with future detectors playing a key role in advancing our understanding of neutrino interactions and electroweak physics at low energies.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Can Quasi-periodic Eruptions Produce Detectable High Energy Neutrinos?</strong>, Zhi-peng Ma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03904v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.03904v1</a></p>

<p>Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a class of X-ray flaring phenomena that occur at the centers of galactic nuclei and are likely to arise from repeated interactions between a star and an accretion disk. This work investigates whether such disk-crossing events can accelerate protons and generate detectable high-energy neutrinos. Based on observed QPE luminosities, recurrence periods, and flare durations, the stellar motion parameters and the disk properties are evaluated. We consider proton acceleration during the breakout phase and evaluate neutrino production, accounting for both $pp$ and $p\gamma$ interactions. Applying the method to ten observed QPE sources, we estimate the neutrino fluence accumulated over a 10-year observation period and compute the corresponding detection numbers for IceCube and IceCube-Gen2. Our analysis indicates that protons can be accelerated up to several tens of TeV, and neutrino production is mostly confined below $\sim 10~\mathrm{TeV}$. The resulting optimized neutrino fluence spans from $ 7.0 \times 10^{-7} $ to $1.5 \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{GeV~cm^{-2}}$ for these ten QPE sources. We find that the expected neutrino detection number for a single QPE source is low, and the expected neutrino detection number would approach unity only for the most promising QPE source occurring at a distance closer than a few Mpc. Next-generation neutrino telescopes with better detection sensitivities at $\lesssim \rm TeV$ can significantly improve the capture capacity of the cumulative neutrino signal from the QPE population.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Renormalization-Free Galaxy Bias in Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory</strong>, Naonori Sugiyama et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04142v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04142v1</a></p>

<p>We present a renormalization-free framework for modeling galaxy bias based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). In this approach, the biased density fluctuation is built solely from Galileon-type operators associated with the intrinsic nonlinear growth of dark matter. This ensures the bias expansion is well defined at the field level, automatically satisfies statistical conditions of vanishing ensemble and volume averages, and removes the need for ad hoc renormalization. We derive analytic one-loop expressions for the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter power spectra and implement an efficient numerical algorithm using \texttt{FFTLog} and \texttt{FAST-PT}, enabling rapid and accurate evaluation. The model requires only a minimal set of bias parameters: three parameters are sufficient to describe correlation functions in configuration space, while four parameters are needed for power spectra in Fourier space. To test accuracy, we jointly fit halo auto- and cross-spectra from the \textit{Dark Emulator}, covering nine redshift-mass combinations with 100 cosmologies each. A single set of bias parameters reproduces both spectra within $\sim1\%$ up to $k \simeq 0.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for typical linear bias $b_1 \sim 0.8$-2, and to $k \simeq 0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $b_1 \sim 3$. The same parameters also match two-point correlation functions down to $r \simeq 15\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. Moreover, ULPT predicts the relation $b_{K^2}^{\mathrm{E}} = -\tfrac{3}{4} b_2^{\mathrm{E}}$, validated against $N$-body results. These results demonstrate that ULPT provides a physically consistent and efficient model for nonlinear galaxy bias, with applications to redshift-space distortions, bispectra, and reconstruction. The numerical implementation is released as the open-source Python package https://github.com/naonori/ulptkit.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Primordial black holes versus their impersonators at gravitational wave observatories</strong>, Andrea Begnoni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04028v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04028v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of primordial black holes (PBHs) would mark a major breakthrough, with far-reaching implications for early universe cosmology, fundamental physics, and the nature of dark matter. Gravitational wave observations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and properties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes that can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling signal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact object (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can produce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this work, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space, including binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter equations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation gravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We compute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\geq 3\sigma$) detections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing quantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various observational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors will be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of $z \sim 3$. For heavier objects with masses up to $M \lesssim 2 M_\odot$, we show that PBHs can be distinguished from neutron stars via their lack of tidal effects up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.2$.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Shadow and Quasi-Normal Modes of Schwarzschild-Hernquist Black Hole</strong>, Xing-Hui Feng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04001v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04001v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper we study the shadow and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a black hole (BH) surrounded by a dark matter halo with Hernquist-type density distribution, which was reported in Ref. \cite{Cardoso:2021wlq}. In astrophysical scenarios, we find that the shadow radius enlarges as the compactness of halo increases. Therefore, we obtain an upper bound for the compactness ${\cal C}\le0.092$ with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. We calculate axial gravitational QNMs of the galactic BH up to ${\cal C}\sim{\cal O}(1)$, and fit the redshift relative to Schwarzschild QNMs up to second order in the compactness (for ${\cal C}\le0.3)$. These highly redshifted QNMs, resulting from large compactness, are key to modeling the dark matter halo.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Signatures from Non-classical Features of Axion Dark Matter in Cavity Haloscopes</strong>, Erik W. Lentz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03877v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.03877v1</a></p>

<p>I present in this article how non-classical features in the local axion dark matter state may imprint on cavity haloscopes. Example signatures from squeezed and pair-entangled DM states are presented and their potential for sensitivity enhancements of experimental searches attuned to these signatures compared to traditional classical field signatures are discussed.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Stability analysis of two-fluid neutron stars featuring twin star and ultradense configurations</strong>, Ankit Kumar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03862v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.03862v1</a></p>

<p>We perform a detailed analysis of radial oscillations to discuss dynamical stability in two-fluid neutron stars composed of ordinary nuclear matter and a gravitationally coupled dark matter component. Using a fully relativistic two-fluid formalism, we solve the eigenvalue problem for a coupled system of equations with small-amplitude radial perturbations and derive the critical line corresponding to stability boundaries. We also compare these stability boundary lines obtained from the radial perturbations with those obtained from a generalized turning-point criterion based on extremization of mass and particle numbers, and find that the two methods agree to within better than $1\%$ across the parameter space explored. We consider both mirror dark matter and self-interacting fermionic dark matter models, and examine how microphysical properties$-$such as nuclear equations of state, dark matter mass, and vector coupling strength$-$reshape the topology of the stability boundary and gravitational mass contours. Our results reveal the emergence of ultra-dense and compact stars, with nuclear central densities exceeding single-fluid instability thresholds by factors of two or more, and the appearance of twin-star configurations with identical masses but distinct radii and internal fluid compositions. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of neutron star observables and motivate future studies involving phase transitions, density discontinuities, or additional interactions in multi-component stellar systems. In particular, the emergence of exotic stable configurations beyond conventional stability limits underscores the need to reassess standard criteria in light of multi-fluid dynamics, with significant consequences for multimessenger probes of dense matter$-$including gravitational wave signals, mass-radius constraints, and post-merger remnants.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>Confirming lensed-quasar candidates with DESI and P200 spectroscopy I. 14 lensed quasars and 8 lensed galaxy</strong>, Zizhao He et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03858v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.03858v1</a></p>

<p>Lensed quasars are powerful probes of cosmology, the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, and the distribution of dark matter. We cross-match 1,724 previously identified candidates from HSC, KiDS, and the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS) with DESI DR1, obtaining 937 DESI spectra for 677 unique systems. Combining DESI spectroscopy with observations from the Palomar 200-inch Double Spectrograph (P200/DBSP), we confirm three lensed quasars with source redshifts of 1.71, 1.93, and 3.23 and Einstein radii of 0.96, 0.39, and 1.07 arcsec, respectively. We further identify 11 high-confidence candidates that are well reproduced by a simple singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, exhibit lens galaxies in the image modeling, and have at least one available spectrum; across these, the Einstein radius spans 0.39 to 2.34 arcsec and the source redshift spans 1.13 to 2.88. In 8 of the 11 cases, the systems already satisfy our lensing criteria except that only one quasar image currently has a spectrum; obtaining a second spectrum for the other image would enable immediate confirmation. As by-products, we report eight new lensed galaxies spanning galaxy- to group-scale lenses. These results provide valuable targets for follow-up studies and underscore the efficiency of wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as DESI in confirming gravitationally lensed quasars and galaxies.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>SISSI: Supernovae in a stratified, shearing interstellar medium. II. Star formation near the Sun is quenched by expansion of the Local Bubble</strong>, Leonard E. C. Romano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04221v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04221v1</a></p>

<p>The age of the Local Bubble (LB) can be used to constrain the timescales, on which the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood is evolving. Previous estimates have put the age of the LB at $\gtrsim 14\,\text{Myr}$, and suggested that its expansion was powered by $\sim 15-20$ SNe, yet in a companion paper we have seen hints that this age might be too high. Following up on these hints, we aim to place new constraints on the age of the LB. We reconstruct the geometry and momentum of the LB using publicly available 3D dust maps to compare its geometry to that of the high-quality sample of simulated supernova remnants in the SISSI project. We find that, in contrast to previous estimates, $\gtrsim 20$ SNe over $\sim 4\,\text{Myr}$ are required to explain both the momentum and the size of the LB. The julia source-code for our analysis is made available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17054923. Previous estimates of the age of the LB have seemingly overestimated its age and underestimated the number of SNe powering its expansion. Our results are in tension with the assumption that the LB is powered solely by SNe associated with the nearby Scorpius-Centraurus OB association, which appears to have stopped forming stars at about the same time as the LB began to expand. In light of this new evidence, our results cast serious doubts on the claim that star formation in the solar neighborhood was driven by the expansion of the LB, and might have instead quenched it.</p>

<p>Stellar theory predicts a forbidden range of black-hole masses between ${\sim}50$–$130\,M_\odot$ due to pair-instability supernovae, but evidence for such a gap in the mass distribution from gravitational-wave astronomy has proved elusive. Early hints of a cutoff in black-hole masses at ${\sim} 45\,M_\odot$ disappeared with the subsequent discovery of more massive binary black holes. Here, we report evidence of the pair-instability gap in LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA’s fourth gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC-4), with a lower boundary of $45_{-4}^{+5} M_\odot$ (90\% credibility). While the gap is not present in the distribution of \textit{primary} masses $m_1$ (the bigger of the two black holes in a binary system), it appears unambiguously in the distribution of \textit{secondary} masses $m_2$, where $m_2 \leq m_1$. The location of the gap lines up well with a previously identified transition in the binary black-hole spin distribution; binaries with primary components in the gap tend to spin more rapidly than those below the gap. We interpret these findings as evidence for a subpopulation of hierarchical mergers: binaries where the primary component is the product of a previous black-hole merger and thus populates the gap. Our measurement of the location of the pair-instability gap constrains the $S$-factor for $^{12}\rm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\rm{O}$ at 300keV to $256_{-104}^{+197}$ keV barns.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>New Arabic records from Cairo on supernovae 1181 and 1006</strong>, J. G. Fischer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04127v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04127v1</a></p>

<p>The remnant of the historical supernova SN 1181 is under discussion: While the previously suggested G130.7+3.1 (3C58) appears too old (3000-5000 yr), the unusual star IRAS 00500+6713 with a surrounding nebula (Pa-30) has an expansion age not inconsistent with a SN Iax explosion in AD 1181 under the assumption that neither acceleration nor deceleration occurred. Previously, only reports from China and Japan were known, pointing to an event near the northern circumpolar region. Any further reports from other cultures can therefore be highly relevant. We present here an Arabic poem in praise of Saladin by the contemporaneous author Ibn San=a’ al-Mulk (Cairo, Egypt). We re-date its composition to between Dec 1181 and May 1182. It contains a new bright star, which can be identified as SN 1181. The poem also provides new and independent information on the object type (called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">najm' for </code>star’), location on sky (in or near the Arabic constellation al-Kaff al-Khab=ib, lit. the henna-dyed hand (five bright stars in Cassiopeia), and brightness (brighter than alpha Cas, 2.25 mag). In addition, we present another Arabic text on SN 1006, also from Cairo, by the historian al-Maqr=iz=i, probably based on the contemporaneous al-Musabbih=i</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>ZTF SNe Ia DR2: Towards cosmology-grade ZTF supernova light curves using scene modeling photometry</strong>, L. Lacroix et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04073v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04073v1</a></p>

<p>The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is conducting a wide-field survey of the northern sky in three optical bands and the collaboration cosmology working group has released 3628 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered during its first 2.5 years of operation. This “ZTF SN Ia DR2” sample is the largest SN Ia dataset to date.   Fully exploiting this dataset to improve understanding of the properties of dark energy requires a photometric accuracy of O(0.1%). This can be achieved using Scene Modeling Photometry (SMP), which is optimal to extract a transient signal (SN) from a complex background (its host), while ensuring a common flux estimator with nearby stars used as calibration reference. In this paper, we present the status of the SMP development and use it to assess the precision and accuracy of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 force photometry light curves.   We reach a repeatability of the star observations better than 1%. However, we have identified a new sensor effect, dubbed “pocket-effect”, which distorts the Point Spread Function (PSF) in a flux-dependent manner leading to non-linearities in the photometry of a few percent. Correcting for this effect requires time- and sensor-dependent corrections to be applied at the pixel level, which is currently under development. This effects affects all light curve releases to date – both from forced photometry and scene modelling preventing ZTF SN Ia DR2 to be used for accurate cosmological inference.   Comparing the SMP and forced photometry measurements, we find that stretch and color estimated from both processings are consistent, aside from a 10 mmag shift in color. This assess the robustness of results presented as part of the the ZTF SN Ia DR2 release. The absolute calibration however shifts by 90 mmag. A reprocessing of the full ZTF SN Ia DR2 dataset using the SMP method is currently in progress.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>COLIBRE: calibrating subgrid feedback in cosmological simulations that include a cold gas phase</strong>, Evgenii Chaikin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04067v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.04067v1</a></p>

<p>We present the calibration of stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in the subgrid model for the new COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. COLIBRE directly simulates the multi-phase interstellar medium and the evolution of dust grains, which is coupled to the chemistry. COLIBRE is calibrated at three resolutions: particle masses of $m_{\rm gas} \approx m_{\rm dm} \sim 10^7$ (m7), $10^6$ (m6), and $10^5~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (m5). To calibrate the COLIBRE feedback at m7 resolution, we run Latin hypercubes of $\approx 200$ simulations that vary up to four subgrid parameters in cosmological volumes of ($50~\mathrm{cMpc}$)$^{3}$. We train Gaussian process emulators on these simulations to predict the $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and size - stellar mass relation (SSMR) as functions of the model parameters, which we then fit to observations. The trained emulators not only provide the best-fitting parameter values but also enable us to investigate how different aspects of the prescriptions for supernova and AGN feedback affect the predictions. In particular, we demonstrate that while the observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR can be matched individually with a relatively simple supernova feedback model, simultaneously reproducing both necessitates a more sophisticated prescription. We show that the calibrated m7 COLIBRE model not only reproduces the calibration target observables, but also matches various other galaxy properties to which the model was not calibrated. Finally, we apply the calibrated m7 model to the m6 and m5 resolutions and, after slight manual adjustments of the subgrid parameters, achieve a similar level of agreement with the observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR.</p>

<p>2025-09-04, <strong>PANDORA: New avenues in sub-percent photometric precision for ground based astronomy</strong>, Kane M. Sjoberg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03843v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.03843v1</a></p>

<p>Precision photometric calibration is key to a number of astrophysical research areas such as supernova cosmology and dark energy studies. In the age of large surveys, pushing the limits of photometry is a worthy challenge, with traditional celestial calibrators limited to approximately percent precision. Here we present PANDORA, a novel calibration source that achieves sub-percent photometric precision across the optical spectrum with a selectable dynamic range and high optical efficiency. Building on proven collimated beam projector designs for relative throughput calibration of survey telescopes, PANDORA is capable of delivering photons anywhere in the 350-1100 nm spectral range. It uses selectable neutral density filters and sequential NIST-calibrated photodiode feedback to internally self-calibrate prior to operation, and is illuminated by an Energetiq EQ-99X-FC broadband laser-driven light source. We present here an overview of the system design, operation, and laboratory characterization results. PANDORA will begin science operations this year to support the upcoming LS4 survey on the ESO 1m Schmidt telescope.</p>
