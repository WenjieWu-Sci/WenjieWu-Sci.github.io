<p>2024-05-07, <strong>Landscape, Swampland, and Extra Dimensions</strong>, Luis Anchordoqui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04427v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.04427v1</a></p>

<p>By combining swampland conjectures with observational data, it was recently suggested that the cosmological hierarchy problem (i.e. the smallness of the dark energy in Planck units) could be understood as an asymptotic limit in field space, corresponding to a decompactification of one extra (dark) dimension of a size in the micron range. In these Proceedings we examine the fundamental setting of this framework and discuss general aspects of the effective low energy theory inherited from properties of the overarching string theory. We then explore some novel phenomenology encompassing the dark dimension by looking at potential dark matter candidates, decoding neutrino masses, and digging into new cosmological phenomena.</p>

<p>2024-05-07, <strong>Constraining the mass-spectra in the presence of a light sterile neutrino from absolute mass-related observables</strong>, Srubabati Goswami et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04176v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.04176v1</a></p>

<p>The framework of three-flavor neutrino oscillation is a well-established phenomenon, but results from the short-baseline experiments, such as the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) and MiniBooster Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE), hint at the potential existence of an additional light neutrino state characterized by a mass-squared difference of approximately $1\,\rm eV^2$. The new neutrino state is devoid of all Standard Model (SM) interactions, commonly referred to as a ‘sterile’ state. In addition, a sterile neutrino with a mass-squared difference of $10^{-2}$ $\rm eV^2$ has been proposed to improve the tension between the results obtained from the Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) and the NuMI Off-axis $\nu_e$ Appearance (NO$\nu$A) experiments. Further, the non-observation of the predicted upturn in the solar neutrino spectra below 8 MeV can be explained by postulating an extra light sterile neutrino state with a mass-squared difference around $10^{-5} \rm eV^2$. The hypothesis of an additional light sterile neutrino state introduces four distinct mass spectra depending on the sign of the mass-squared difference. In this paper, we discuss the implications of the above scenarios on the observables that depend on the absolute mass of the neutrinos, namely the sum of the light neutrino masses $(\Sigma)$ from cosmology, the effective mass of the electron neutrino from beta decay $(m_{\beta})$, and the effective Majorana mass $( m_{\beta\beta})$ from neutrinoless double beta decay. We show that some scenarios can be disfavored by the current constraints of the above variables. The implications for projected sensitivity of Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment (KATRIN) and future experiments like Project-8, next Enriched Xenon Observatory (nEXO) have been discussed.</p>

<p>2024-05-07, <strong>Finite modular majoron</strong>, Tae Hyun Jung et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03996v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03996v1</a></p>

<p>We point out that the accidental $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry can arise from a finite modular symmetry $\Gamma_N$ in the type-I seesaw. The finite modular symmetry is spontaneously broken in such a way that the residual $\mathbb{Z}^T_N$ discrete symmetry, associated with the $T$-transformation which shifts the modulus $\tau \to \tau+ 1$, remains unbroken. This discrete $\mathbb{Z}^T_N$ symmetry mimics $U(1)_{B-L}$, and hence the majoron appears as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson of $U(1)_{B-L}$. Without introducing additional interactions, the modulus $\tau$ can be stabilized by the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) potential given by the Majorana mass terms of the right-handed neutrinos. We study cosmological implications of the majoron, with particular interests in the dark matter and dark radiation, where the latter may alleviate the Hubble tension. We also find that the CW potential can have a wide range of nearly exponential shape which prevents $\tau$ from overshooting, and makes the amount of dark radiation not too large.</p>

<p>2024-05-07, <strong>Collapse of Neutrino Wave Functions under Penrose Gravitational Reduction</strong>, B. J. P. Jones et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03954v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03954v1</a></p>

<p>Models of spontaneous wave function collapse have been postulated to address the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Their primary function is to convert coherent quantum superpositions into incoherent ones, with the result that macroscopic objects cannot be placed into widely separated superpositions for observably prolonged times. Many of these processes will also lead to loss of coherence in neutrino oscillations, producing observable signatures in the flavor profile of neutrinos at long travel distances. The majority of studies of neutrino oscillation coherence to date have focused on variants of the continuous state localization model, whereby an effective decoherence strength parameter is used to model the rate of coherence loss with an assumed energy dependence. Another class of collapse models that have been proposed posit connections to the configuration of gravitational field accompanying the mass distribution associated with each wave function that is in the superposition. A particularly interesting and prescriptive model is Penrose’s description of gravitational collapse which proposes a decoherence time $\tau$ determined through $E_{g}\tau\sim\hbar$, where $E_{g}$ is a calculable function of the Newtonian gravitational potential. Here we explore application of the Penrose collapse model to neutrino oscillations, reinterpreting previous experimental limits on neutrino decoherence in terms of this model. We identify effects associated with both spatial collapse and momentum diffusion, finding that the latter is ruled out in data from the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory so long as the neutrino wave packet width at production is $\sigma_{\nu,x}\leq2\times10^{-12}$ m.</p>

<p>2024-05-07, <strong>Remark on neutrino oscillations</strong>, Kazuo Fujikawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03940v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03940v1</a></p>

<p>The oscillations of ultra-relativistic neutrinos are realized by the propagation of assumed zero-mass on-shell neutrinos with the speed of light in vacuum combined with the phase modulation by the small mass term $\exp[-i(m^{2}_{\nu_{k}}/2|\vec{p}|)\tau]$ with a time parameter $\tau$. This picture is realized in the first quantization by the mass expansion and in field theory by the use of $\delta(x^{0}-y^{0}-\tau) \langle 0|T^{\star}\nu_{L k}(x)\overline{\nu_{L k}(y)}|0\rangle$ with the neutrino mass eigenstates $\nu_{L k}$ and a finite positive $\tau$ after the contour integral of the propagating neutrino energies.   By noting that the conventional detectors are insensitive to neutrino masses, the measured energy-momenta of the initial and final states with assumed zero-mass neutrinos are conserved. The propagating neutrinos preserve the three-momentum in this sense but the energies of the massive neutrinos are conserved up to uncertainty relations and thus leading to oscillations. Conceptual complications in the case of Majorana neutrinos due to the charge conjugation in $d=4$ are also discussed.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Search for joint multimessenger signals from potential Galactic PeVatrons with HAWC and IceCube</strong>, R. Alfaro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03817v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03817v1</a></p>

<p>Galactic PeVatrons are sources that can accelerate cosmic rays to PeV energies. The high-energy cosmic rays are expected to interact with the surrounding ambient material or radiation, resulting in the production of gamma rays and neutrinos. To optimize for the detection of such associated production of gamma rays and neutrinos for a given source morphology and spectrum, a multi-messenger analysis that combines gamma rays and neutrinos is required. In this study, we use the Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (3ML) with IceCube Maximum Likelihood Analysis software (i3mla) and HAWC Accelerated Likelihood (HAL) to search for a correlation between 22 known gamma-ray sources from the third HAWC gamma-ray catalog and 14 years of IceCube track-like data. No significant neutrino emission from the direction of the HAWC sources was found. We report the best-fit gamma-ray model and 90% CL neutrino flux limit from the 22 sources. From the neutrino flux limit, we conclude that the gamma-ray emission from five of the sources can not be produced purely from hadronic interactions. We report the limit for the fraction of gamma rays produced by hadronic interactions for these five sources.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>One-dimensional power spectrum from first DESI Lyman-α forest</strong>, Corentin Ravoux et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03447v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03447v1</a></p>

<p>The Lyman-alpha forest is a unique probe of large-scale matter density fluctuations at high redshift z &gt; 2. We measure the one-dimensional Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum using the first data provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), with a fast Fourier transform estimator. The data sample contains quasar spectra included in the DESI Early Data Release and the first two months of the main survey. This first set of data already provides an improvement in terms of spectroscopic resolution with respect to the previous measurements. We investigated methodological and instrumental contaminants associated with DESI and used synthetic data to validate and correct our measurement. Coupling our measurement with theoretical predictions from hydrodynamical simulations will yield strong constraints on the primordial matter power spectrum, neutrino masses, and dark matter properties. A quadratic maximum likelihood estimator was applied to the same data set on a companion paper and agrees with our measurement.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Updating neutrino mass constraints with Background measurements</strong>, Deng Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03368v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03368v1</a></p>

<p>Low-redshift probes, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae Ia luminosity distances, have been shown to be crucial for improving the bounds on the total neutrino mass from cosmological observations, due to their ability to break degeneracies among the different parameters. Here, we expand background observations to include $H(z)$ measurements from cosmic chronometers, distance moduli from Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters. For the very first time, we find neutrino mass limits below the minimal expectations from neutrino oscillation probes, suggesting non-standard neutrino and/or cosmological scenarios. The tightening of the neutrino mass bound is due to the slightly higher value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ preferred by the former three background probes, and also due to the improved errors on $H_0$ and the matter mass-energy density $\Omega_{\rm m}$. All values of $H_0$ are however in agreement at the $1-2\sigma$ level. Interestingly, it is not only the combination of the three background probes that is responsible for the $\sum m_\nu &lt;0.06$~eV limits, but also each of them independently. The tightest bound we find here is $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.043$~eV at $2\sigma$ after combining Cosmic Microwave Background Planck data with DESI BAO, Supernovae Ia, GRBs, cosmic chronometers, and galaxy clusters, showing a clear tension between neutrino oscillation results and cosmological analyses. In general, removing either one of the two background probes still provides a limit $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$~eV, reassuring the enormous potential of these low-redshift observations in constraining the neutrino mass.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Study of quantum decoherence at Protvino to ORCA experiment</strong>, Chinmay Bera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03286v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03286v1</a></p>

<p>Protvino to ORCA (Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss) (P2O) is an upcoming neutrino oscillation experiment with a very long baseline of 2595 km. Due to the substantial baseline, this experiment provides a unique opportunity to study the earth matter effects over very large distances. This makes it a suitable experiment to investigate the environmental decoherence in neutrino oscillations, where the neutrino system could interact with a stochastic environment and lead to a loss in the coherence of neutrino states. In this work, we consider an open quantum system framework to simulate the neutrino oscillations in P2O experiment and obtain bounds on the decoherence parameters in different phenomenological models. We assume that the decoherence parameter $\Gamma$ depends on neutrino energy $E_\nu$ as $\Gamma_{ij}(E_\nu) = \Gamma_{0} (\frac{E_\nu}{E_0})^n$. Further, we use these bounds to study the effect on the neutrino mass ordering sensitivity and CP violation sensitivity of P2O experiment.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Choked precessing jets in tidal disruption events and high-energy neutrinos</strong>, Qi-Rui Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03139v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03139v1</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested that relativistic jets might have been commonly formed in tidal disruption events (TDEs), but those with relatively weak power could be choked by the surrounding envelope. The discovery of high-energy neutrinos possibly associated with some normal TDEs may support this picture in the hypothesis that the neutrinos are produced by choked jets. Recently, it was noted that disrupted stars generally have misaligned orbits with respect to the supermassive black hole spin axis and highly misaligned precessing jets are more likely to be choked. Here we revisit the jet break-out condition for misaligned precessing jets by considering the jet could be collimated by the cocoon pressure while propagating in the disk wind envelope. The jet head opening angle decreases as the jet propagates in the envelope, but the minimum power of a successful jet remains unchanged in terms of the physical jet power. We further calculate the neutrino flux from choked precessing jets, assuming that the cocoon energy does not exceed the kinetic energy of the disk wind. We find that neutrino flux from highly misaligned choked jets is sufficient to explain the neutrinos from AT2019aalc, while it is marginal to explain the neutrinos from AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr. The latter could be produced by weakly misaligned choked jets, since the duty cycle that the jet sweeps across increases as the misaligned angle decreases. We also show that the population of choked TDE jets could contribute to ~10% of the observed diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube.</p>

<p>2024-05-07, <strong>Constraining Millicharged dark matter with Gravitational positivity bounds</strong>, Suro Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04454v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.04454v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitational positivity bounds provide consistency conditions for effective field theories with gravity. They turn out to be phenomenologically useful by providing lower bounds in parameters of new physics beyond the Standard Models (BSM). In this paper, we derive constraints on millicharged fermion dark matter models with massless dark photon using gravitational positivity bounds. Combining them with upper bounds from cosmological and astrophysical observations, we can severely constrain the parameter space of the model. In particular, we show that when the dark matter mass is lighter than the solar core temperature, most of the parameter region is excluded by combining gravitational positivity bounds and the stellar bounds.</p>

<p>2024-05-07, <strong>Primordial monopoles, black holes and gravitational waves</strong>, Ahmad Moursy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04397v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.04397v1</a></p>

<p>We show how topologically stable superheavy magnetic monopoles and primordial black holes can be generated at observable levels by the waterfall field in hybrid inflation models based on grand unified theories. In $SU(5) \times U(1)_\chi$ grand unification, the monopole mass is of order $4 \times 10^{17}$ GeV, and it carries a single unit ($2 \pi /e$) of Dirac magnetic charge as well as screened color magnetic charge. The monopole density is partially diluted to an observable value, and accompanied with the production of primordial black holes with mass of order $10^{17}$-$10^{19}$ g which may make up the entire dark matter in the universe. The tensor to scalar ratio $r$ is predicted to be of order $10^{-5}$ - $10^{-4}$ which should be testable in the next generation of CMB experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. The gravitational wave spectrum generated during the waterfall transition is also presented.</p>

<p>2024-05-07, <strong>Foreground biases in strong gravitational lensing</strong>, Daniel Johnson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04194v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.04194v1</a></p>

<p>Strong gravitational lensing is a competitive tool to probe the dark matter and energy content of the universe. However, significant uncertainties can arise from the choice of lens model, and in particular the parameterisation of the line of sight. In this work, we consider the consequences of ignoring the contribution of foreground perturbers in lens modelling. We derive the explicit form of the degeneracy between the foreground shear and the ellipticity of a power law lens, which renders both quantities effectively unmeasurable from strong lensing observables. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that this degeneracy does not affect measurements of the Einstein radius. Foreground tidal effects are also not expected to bias the slope of the potential, and further that any biases in this slope should not affect the recovery of the Hubble constant. The foreground convergence term adds an additional uncertainty to the measurement of $H_0$, and we show that this uncertainty will be on the order of $1\%$ for lensing systems located along random lines of sight. There is evidence to indicate that the probability of strong lensing is higher towards overdense lines of sight, and this could result in a small systematic bias towards overestimations of $H_0$.</p>

<p>2024-05-07, <strong>MEET-U Project I: The key drivers of the preference for dynamic dark energy</strong>, Zhiqi Huang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03983v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03983v1</a></p>

<p>Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We demonstrate that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at $3.2\sigma$ level when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. By comparing the data with over $10^4$ $\Lambda$CDM-based simulations, we find that both the SNe and BAO data contribute significantly to the preference for dynamic dark energy. The preference for dynamic dark energy is unlikely (probability $\lesssim 0.02$) due to unknown systematics in DES5YR SNe and statistical fluctuations in DESI BAO, or vice versa.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Exploring Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos with Diverse Baryonic Distributions: A Parametric Approach</strong>, Daneng Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03787v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03787v1</a></p>

<p>Galaxies residing in dark matter halos exert significant gravitational effects that alter halo structure and dynamics. The complexity of these interactions escalates with the diversity of galactic structures and the variability in dark matter halo profiles under self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models. This work extends the parametric model for dark matter-only halos presented in arXiv:2305.16176 to incorporate baryons. We adapt this model to consistently represent the SIDM halo density profile over time, highlighting the role of a gravothermal phase in characterizing the state of an SIDM halo. Given this phase, the density profile in SIDM is determined by a fictitious progenitor – consisting of an NFW halo influenced by a baryonic potential – that has evolved to its present state. In the temporal dimension, the model incorporates a form factor that rescales the evolution time in the dark matter-only case, thereby enabling the introduction of a universal phase. In the radial dimension, the halo density profile is parametrized to reflect the influences of baryons. We calibrate the model through N-body simulations with baryon potentials to fit various stellar-to-halo mass ratios and size-mass relationships. Our parametric approach is numerically efficient, enabling the exploration of SIDM effects across a diverse set of halos, as exemplified by a case study using an illustrative sample that spans five orders of magnitude in the mass range. We also demonstrate that the effects of evolution history and the specific SIDM model can be separated from the current states of galaxies and halos, leaving the task of identifying consistent SIDM models to dedicated post-processing analyses.</p>

<p>We study the environment of the z=6.33 ultraluminous quasar SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 (J0100) to understand its association with large-scale structure. Theoretical models propose high-redshift quasars as markers of galaxy overdensities residing in the most massive dark matter halos (DMHs) in the early universe. J0100 is an ultraluminous quasar with the most massive black hole known at z&gt;6, suggesting a high likelihood of residing in a massive DMH. We present wide-field ($\sim$522 square arcminute) imaging in the r-, i-, and z-bands from the Large Binocular Camera on the Large Binocular Telescope, with Y- and J-band imaging from the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, centered on J0100. Applying color selections, we identify 23 objects as i-droput Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) candidates in the J0100 field. We use the deep photometric catalog in the 1.27 square degree COSMOS field to calculate the density of LBGs in a blank field, and to estimate the selection completeness and purity. The observed surface density of LBG candidates in the J0100 field corresponds to a galaxy overdensity of $\delta$=4 (at 8.4$\sigma$). This large-scale overdensity suggests that the $\sim$ 22 square arcminute overdensity found by Kashino et al. using JWST data extends out to much larger scales. We calculate the angular auto-correlation function of the candidates and find a positive correlation on $\lesssim$ 10 arcminute scales as well as evidence of asymmetries in their spatial distribution, further suggesting a direct detection of large-scale structure around the ultra-luminous quasar J0100.</p>

<p>We study freeze-in production of Higgs portal dark matter (DM) at temperatures far below the dark matter mass. The temperature of the Standard Model (SM) thermal bath may have never been high such that dark matter production via thermal emission has been Boltzmann suppressed. This allows for a significant coupling between the Higgs field and DM, which is being probed by the direct DM detection experiments and invisible Higgs decay searches at the LHC. We delineate the corresponding parameter space in the Higgs portal framework with dark matter of spin 0, 1/2 and 1.</p>

<p>We discuss a class of theories that predict a fermionic dark matter candidate from gauge anomaly cancellation. As an explicit example, we study the predictions in theories where the global symmetry associated with baryon number is promoted to a local gauge symmetry. In this context the symmetry-breaking scale has to be below the multi-TeV scale in order to be in agreement with the cosmological constraints on the dark matter relic density. The new physical “Cucuyo” Higgs boson in the theory has very interesting properties, decaying mainly into two photons in the low mass region, and mainly into dark matter in the intermediate mass region. We study the most important signatures at the Large Hadron Collider, evaluating the experimental bounds. We discuss the correlation between the dark matter relic density, direct detection and collider constraints. We find that these theories are still viable, and are susceptible to being probed in current, and future high-luminosity, running.</p>

<p>We propose a microwave-laser-mixed three-beam stimulated resonant photon collider, which enables access to axion-like particles in the meV mass range. Collisions between a focused pulse laser beam and a focused microwave pulse beam directly produce axion-like particles (ALPs) and another focused pulse laser beam stimulates their decay. The expected sensitivity in the meV mass range has been evaluated. The result shows that the sensitivity can reach the ALP-photon coupling down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$~GeV${}^{-1}$ with $10^6$ shots if 10-100 TW class high-intensity lasers are properly combined with a conventional 100 MW class S-band klystron. This proposal paves the way for identifying the nature of ALPs as candidates for dark matter, independent of any cosmological and astrophysical models.</p>

<p>Finding low-dimensional interpretable models of complex physical fields such as turbulence remains an open question, 80 years after the pioneer work of Kolmogorov. Estimating high-dimensional probability distributions from data samples suffers from an optimization and an approximation curse of dimensionality. It may be avoided by following a hierarchic probability flow from coarse to fine scales. This inverse renormalization group is defined by conditional probabilities across scales, renormalized in a wavelet basis. For a $\varphi^4$ scalar potential, sampling these hierarchic models avoids the critical slowing down at the phase transition. An outstanding issue is to also approximate non-Gaussian fields having long-range interactions in space and across scales. We introduce low-dimensional models with robust multiscale approximations of high order polynomial energies. They are calculated with a second wavelet transform, which defines interactions over two hierarchies of scales. We estimate and sample these wavelet scattering models to generate 2D vorticity fields of turbulence, and images of dark matter densities.</p>

<p>The light we observe from distant astrophysical objects including supernovae and quasars allows us to determine large distances in terms of a cosmological model. Despite the success of the standard cosmological model in fitting the data, there remains no underlying explanation for the accelerated expansion and dark matter. Furthermore, there is a current tension between early- and late-universe determinations of the Hubble constant. New techniques may offer the possibility of measuring out to larger distances, provide complementary information, or be able to side-step current limitations. After reviewing in detail the fundamentals of standard cosmology and gravitational lensing, including a derivation of the cosmological lens equation, this thesis investigates a novel method of cosmography based on combining the techniques of strong gravitational lensing time delay measurements and quasar reverberation mapping. The motivation for this method was the possibility of avoiding lens modelling challenges, such as the mass-sheet degeneracy, typically associated with time delay cosmography. It suggested that differential time delays originating from spatially separated signals in the Broad Line Region of a quasar could be distinguished and measured from the spectroscopy of the images, and utilised to provide a ratio of cosmological distances independent of the lensing potential. An analytic description of the effect of the differential lensing on the emission line spectral flux for axisymmetric Broad Line Region geometries is given, with the inclined ring or disk, spherical shell, and double cone as examples. This critical examination shows that the proposed method is unable to recover cosmological information, as the observed time delay and inferred line-of-sight velocity do not uniquely map to the three-dimensional position within the quasar.</p>

<p>We propose two generalizations of the dark photon model which predict the suppressed elastic dark matter nuclei cross section in comparison with the corresponding prediction of the dark photon model. In the first model the main difference from dark photon model is that the mixing parameter $\epsilon$ is nonlocal formfactor $\epsilon(q^2)= \frac{q^2}{\Lambda^2}V(\frac{q^2}{\Lambda^2}) $ depending on the square of the momentum transfer $q^2$. Here $V(\frac{q^2}{\Lambda^2})$ is an entire function of the growth $\rho \geq \frac{1}{2}$ and $\Lambda$ is nonlocal scale. In this model our world and dark world are described by renormalizable field theories while the communication between them is performed by nonlocal interaction. The second model is renormalizable model where besides dark photon field $A’$ additional vector boson $Z’$ interacts with $B - L$ current. The communication between our world and dark world is performed due to nonzero kinetic mixing between $Z’$ and $A’$ fields. The predictions of the models for the search for dark matter at the accelerators don’t contain additional suppression factors.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>On bursty star formation during cosmological reionization - how does it influence the baryon mass content of dark matter halos?</strong>, Anand Menon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03211v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03211v1</a></p>

<p>The baryon mass content of dark matter halos in the early Universe depends on global factors - e.g. ionising ultraviolet (UV) radiation background - and local factors - e.g. star formation efficiency and assembly history. We use a lightweight semi-analytical model to investigate how local and global factors impact halo baryon mass content at redshifts of $z\geq 5$. Our model incorporates a time delay between when stars form and when they produce feedback, which drive bursts of star formation, and a mass and redshift dependent UV background, which captures the influence of cosmological reionization on gas accretion onto halos. We use statistically representative halo assembly histories and assume that the cosmological gas accretion rate is proportional to the halo mass accretion rate. Delayed feedback leads to oscillations in gas mass with cosmic time, behaviour that cannot be captured with instantaneous feedback. Highly efficient star formation drives stronger oscillations, while strong feedback impacts when oscillations occur; in contrast, inefficient star formation and weak feedback produce similar long-term behaviour to that observed in instantaneous feedback models. If the delayed feedback timescale is too long, a halo retains its gas reservoir but the feedback suppresses star formation. Our model predicts that lower mass systems ($\leq 10^7 \text{M}_\odot$) at $z \leq 10$ should be strongly gas deficient, whereas higher mass systems retain their gas reservoirs because they are sufficiently massive to continue accreting gas through cosmological reionization. Interestingly, in higher mass halos, the median $m_\star/(m_\star+m_\text{g}) \simeq 0.01-0.05$, but is a factor of 3-5 smaller when feedback is delayed. Our model does not include seed supermassive black hole feedback, which is necessary to explain massive quenched galaxies in the early Universe.</p>

<p>Cluster-scale strong lensing is a powerful tool for exploring the properties of dark matter and constraining cosmological models. However, due to the complex parameter space, pixelized strong lens modeling in galaxy clusters is computationally expensive, leading to the point-source approximation of strongly lensed extended images, potentially introducing systematic biases. Herein, as the first paper of the ClUsteR strong Lens modelIng for the Next-Generation observations (CURLING) program, we use lensing ray-tracing simulations to quantify the biases and uncertainties arising from the point-like image approximation for JWST-like observations. Our results indicate that the approximation works well for reconstructing the total cluster mass distribution, but can bias the magnification measurements near critical curves and the constraints on the cosmological parameters, the total matter density of the Universe $\Omega_{\rm m}$, and dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. To mitigate the biases, we propose incorporating the extended surface brightness distribution of lensed sources into the modeling. This approach reduces the bias in magnification from 46.2 per cent to 0.09 per cent for $\mu \sim 1000$. Furthermore, the median values of cosmological parameters align more closely with the fiducial model. In addition to the improved accuracy, we also demonstrate that the constraining power can be substantially enhanced. In conclusion, it is necessary to model cluster-scale strong lenses with pixelized multiple images, especially for estimating the intrinsic luminosity of highly magnified sources and accurate cosmography in the era of high-precision observations.</p>

<p>Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) is caused by the wavelength dependence of our atmosphere’s refractive index, which shifts the apparent positions of stars and galaxies and distorts their shapes depending on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). While this effect is typically mitigated and corrected for in imaging observations, we investigate how DCR can instead be used to our advantage to infer the redshifts of supernovae from multi-band, time-series imaging data. We simulate Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the proposed Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Deep Drilling Field (DDF), and evaluate astrometric redshifts. We find that the redshift accuracy improves dramatically with the statistical quality of the astrometric measurements as well as with the accuracy of the astrometric solution. For a conservative choice of a 5-mas systematic uncertainty floor, we find that our redshift estimation is accurate at $z &lt; 0.6$. We then combine our astrometric redshifts with both host galaxy photometric redshifts and supernovae photometric (light-curve) redshifts and show that this considerably improves the overall redshift estimates. These astrometric redshifts will be valuable especially since Rubin will discover a vast number of supernovae for which we will not be able to obtain spectroscopic redshifts.</p>

<p>Modern photometric surveys of the sky suggest that many, perhaps most supernovae (SNe) associated with the explosion of massive stars are influenced at an appreciable level by their interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). The photometric and spectroscopic diversity of these transients point to a wide range of CSM properties in terms of mass, extent, composition, and location relative to the exploding star, suggesting progenitors that cover from standard to the most extreme mass loss rates. Surveys at high-cadence catch massive stars at shock breakout and inform us on the immediate mass loss history before core collapse. In contrast, long-term monitoring of these SNe cover the transition to the birth of a SN remnant and document the progenitor mass loss that took place centuries to millennia before explosion. Interacting SNe are therefore not just extraordinary astrophysical laboratories to study radiation-dominated shocks and probe the distant Universe, they also open the path to novel and fundamental studies on stellar evolution, stellar stability, or mass loss in single and binary massive stars.</p>

<p>We implement Crossing Statistics to reconstruct in a model-agnostic manner the expansion history of the universe and properties of dark energy, using DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) BAO data in combination with one of three different supernova compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DES-SN5YR) and Planck CMB observations. Our results hint towards an evolving and emergent dark energy behaviour, with negligible presence of dark energy at $z\gtrsim 1$, at varying significance depending on data sets combined. In all these reconstructions, the cosmological constant lies outside the 95\% confidence intervals for some redshift ranges. This dark energy behaviour, reconstructed using Crossing Statistics, is in agreement with results from the conventional $w_0$–$w_a$ dark energy equation of state parametrization reported in the DESI Key cosmology paper. Our results add an extensive class of model-agnostic reconstructions with acceptable fits to the data, including models where cosmic acceleration slows down at low redshifts. We also report constraints on \Hord\ from our model-agnostic analysis, independent of the pre-recombination physics.</p>

<p>Supergiant shells (SGSs) are the largest interstellar structures where heated and enriched gas flows into the host galaxy’s halo. The SGSs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are so close that their stars can be resolved with ground-based telescopes to allow studies of star formation history. Aiming to study the star formation history and energy budget of LMC 4, we have conducted a pilot study of the cluster NGC 2021 and the OB associations in its vicinity near the south rim of LMC 4. We use the Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey data of the LMC to establish a methodology to examine the stellar population and assess the massive star formation history. We find a radial procession of massive star formation from the northwest part of the OB association LH79 through NGC 2021 to the OB association LH78 in the south. Using the stellar content of NGC 2021 and the assumption of Salpeter’s initial mass function, we estimate that $\sim$4 supernovae have occurred in NGC 2021, injecting at least $4\times10^{51}$ ergs of kinetic energy into the interior of LMC 4.</p>

<p>Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We demonstrate that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at $3.2\sigma$ level when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. By comparing the data with over $10^4$ $\Lambda$CDM-based simulations, we find that both the SNe and BAO data contribute significantly to the preference for dynamic dark energy. The preference for dynamic dark energy is unlikely (probability $\lesssim 0.02$) due to unknown systematics in DES5YR SNe and statistical fluctuations in DESI BAO, or vice versa.</p>

<p>JWST observed the magnetar 4U 0142+61 with the MIRI and NIRCam instruments within a 77 min time interval on 2022 September 20-21. The low-resolution MIRI spectrum and NIRCam photometry show that the spectrum in the wavelength range 1.4-11 $\mu$m range can be satisfactorily described by an absorbed power-law model, $f_{\nu}\propto \nu^{-\alpha}$, with a spectral slope $\alpha =0.96\pm0.02$, interstellar extinction $A_V= 3.9\pm0.2$, and normalization $f_0 = 59.4\pm 0.5$ $\mu$Jy at $\lambda = 8$ $\mu$m. These observations do not support the passive disk model proposed by Wang et al. (2006), based on the Spitzer photometry, which was interpreted as evidence for a fallback disk from debris formed during the supernova explosion. We suggest a nonthermal origin for this emission and source variability as the most likely cause of discrepancies between the JWST data and other IR-optical observing campaigns. However, we cannot firmly exclude the presence of a large disk with a different dependence of the effective disk temperature on distance from the magnetar. Comparison with the power-law fit to the hard X-ray spectrum above 10 keV, measured by NuSTAR contemporaneously with JWST, shows that the X-ray spectrum is significantly harder. This may imply that the X-ray and IR nonthermal emission come from different sites in the magnetosphere of the magnetar.</p>

<p>We present the MOST Hosts survey (Multi-Object Spectroscopy of Transient Hosts). The survey is planned to run throughout the five years of operation of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and will generate a spectroscopic catalog of the hosts of most transients observed to date, in particular all the supernovae observed by most public, untargeted, wide-field, optical surveys (PTF/iPTF, SDSS II, ZTF, DECAT, DESIRT). Scientific questions for which the MOST Hosts survey will be useful include Type Ia supernova cosmology, fundamental plane and peculiar velocity measurements, and the understanding of the correlations between transients and their host galaxy properties. Here, we present the first release of the MOST Hosts survey: 21,931 hosts of 20,235 transients. These numbers represent 36% of the final MOST Hosts sample, consisting of 60,212 potential host galaxies of 38,603 transients (a transient can be assigned multiple potential hosts). Of these galaxies, 40% do not appear in the DESI primary target list and therefore require a specific program like MOST Hosts. Of all the transients in the MOST Hosts list, only 26.7% have existing classifications, and so the survey will provide redshifts (and luminosities) for nearly 30,000 transients. A preliminary Hubble diagram and a transient luminosity-duration diagram are shown as examples of future potential uses of the MOST Hosts survey. The survey will also provide a training sample of spectroscopically observed transients for photometry-only classifiers, as we enter an era when most newly observed transients will lack spectroscopic classification. The MOST Hosts DESI survey data will be released through the Wiserep platform on a rolling cadence and updated to match the DESI releases. Dates of future releases and updates are available through the https://mosthosts.desi.lbl.gov website.</p>

<p>In an effort to search for faint sources of emission over arbitrary timescales, we present a novel method for analyzing forced photometry light curves in difference imaging from optical surveys. Our method “ATLAS Clean’’ or ATClean, utilizes the reported fluxes, uncertainties, and fits to the point-spread function from difference images to quantify the statistical significance of individual measurements. We apply this method to control light curves across the image to determine whether any source of flux is present in the data for a range of specific timescales. From ATLAS $o$-band imaging at the site of the Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101 from 2015–2023, we show that this method accurately reproduces the 3$\sigma$ flux limits produced from other, more computationally expensive methods. We derive limits for emission on timescales of 5~days and 80-300~days at the site of SN\,2023ixf, which are 19.8 and 21.3~mag, respectively. The latter limits rule out variability for unextinguished red supergiants (RSG) with initial masses $&gt;$22~$M_{\odot}$, comparable to the most luminous predictions for the SN 2023ixf progenitor system. We also compare our limits to short timescale outbursts, similar to those expected for Type IIn SN progenitor stars or the Type II SN 2020tlf, and rule out outburst ejecta masses of $&gt;$0.021~$M_{\odot}$, much lower than the inferred mass of circumstellar matter around SN 2023ixf in the literature. In the future, these methods can be applied to any forced point-spread function photometry on difference imaging from other surveys, such as Rubin optical imaging.</p>

<p>Differences between the local value of the Hubble constant measured via the distance ladder versus the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background with the assumption of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model have reached over 5$\sigma$ significance. To determine if this discrepancy is due to new physics or more mundane systematic errors, it is essential to remove as many sources of systematic uncertainty as possible by developing high-precision distance ladders that are independent of the traditional Cepheid and Type Ia supernovae route. Here we present JWST observations of three early-type Fornax Cluster galaxies, the first of fourteen observations from a Cycle 2 JWST program. Our modest integration times allow us to measure highly precise tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances, and will also be used to perform measurements of Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF). From these three galaxies, we determine an average TRGB distance modulus to the Fornax Cluster of $\mu$ = 31.424 $\pm$ 0.077 mag, or D = 19.3 $\pm$ 0.7 Mpc. With eleven more scheduled observations in nearby elliptical galaxies, our program will allow us set the zero point of the SBF scale to better than 2$\%$ for more distant measurements, charting a path towards a high-precision measurement of $H_{0}$ that is independent of the traditional Cepheid-SN Ia distance ladder.</p>

<p>We report the ASKAP discovery of a new Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G308.73+1.38, which we name Raspberry. This new SNR candidate has an angular size of 20.7 arcmin $\times$ 16.7 arcmin, and we measure a total integrated flux of 407$\pm$50 mJy. We estimate Raspberry’s most likely diameter of 10$-$30 pc which would place it at a distance of 3$-$5 kpc, on the near side of the Milky Way’s Scutum$-$Centaurus Arm. We also find a Stokes$-$V point source close to the centre of Raspberry with a $\sim$5$\sigma$ significance.

<p>The problem of missing Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) refers to the issue that the currently known Galactic SNRs are significantly incomplete compared to the theoretical prediction. To expand the sample of Galactic SNRs, we use GLEAM and THOR+VGPS data across four wavebands ranging from 118 to 1420 MHz to drive a spectral index map covering the region within 26.6{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 30.6{\deg}, $\vert b \vert \leq$ 1.25{\deg}, where numerous SNR candidates were recently found. By using the spectral index map of the sky region and detailed analysis of the spectral indices of individual sources, we confirmed four SNR candidates, namely G26.75+0.73, G27.06+0.04, G28.36+0.21, and G28.78$-$0.44, as SNRs. Additionally, we discovered an expanding molecular superbubble located in this region, discussed pulsars associated with SNR candidates, and discovered a long H$\alpha$ filament that spatially overlaps with the candidate G29.38+0.10. We suggest that the problem of missing Galactic SNRs not only arises from observation limitations, but also could be due to the low-density environments of some SNRs, and the different SN explosion properties.</p>
