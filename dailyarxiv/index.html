<p>2025-02-26, <strong>Probing a low-mass $Z^{\prime}$ gauge boson at IceCube and prospects for IceCube-Gen2</strong>, Reinaldo Francener et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19338v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.19338v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we investigate the impact of the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model, which predicts a new massive gauge boson, $Z’$, on astrophysical neutrino events at the IceCube Observatory. This new gauge boson couples with leptons from the second and third families, and would break the power law of the astrophysical neutrino flux due to the interaction of this flux with the cosmic neutrino background. We derive the sensitivity of the IceCube to this model considering the HESE data from 12 years of observation by assuming different assumptions for the redshift distributions of astrophysical neutrino sources, mass ordering, and sum of neutrino masses. Our results indicate that the current IceCube data is able to probe small coupling and masses of the order of some few MeV, with the covered parameter space being larger if a distribution of neutrino sources is described by the star formation rate model. In addition, we demonstrate that the IceCube-Gen2 will cover a large region of the parameter space and will allow us to improve our understanding of the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model.</p>

<p>2025-02-26, <strong>A strike of luck: could the KM3-230213A event be caused by an evaporating primordial black hole?</strong>, Andrea Boccia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19245v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.19245v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate whether the ultra high energy neutrino inferred by the recent KM3NeT observation could have originated from an evaporating black hole. Given the characteristics of black hole (BH) evaporation mechanism, any object capable of producing particles in the energy range of the detected event (around 100-800 PeV) must have a mass below 10^7 g. No known astrophysical mechanism can generate black holes of such low mass, leaving primordial black holes (PBHs)-potentially formed at the end of cosmic inflation-as the only viable candidates. Black holes with masses below 10^7 g have lifetimes shorter than 10^-5 seconds, meaning PBHs in this mass range should have fully evaporated by now. However, recent studies suggest that quantum effects, collectively referred to as the “memory burden”, may slow down black hole evaporation, potentially extending the lifetimes of low-mass PBHs to timescales comparable to or exceeding the Hubble time. We systematically explore the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs, assuming that they constitute a fraction of the dark matter (f-PBH) within current constraints, and identify viable regions that could explain the KM3-230213A event. We further predict the occurrence rate of similar events and find that KM3NeT’s current configuration could test this scenario within a few years.</p>

<p>2025-02-26, <strong>Demonstrating the ability of IceCube DeepCore to probe Earth’s interior with atmospheric neutrino oscillations</strong>, Sharmistha Chattopadhyay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18995v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.18995v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is an optical Cherenkov detector instrumenting one cubic kilometer of ice at the South Pole. The Cherenkov photons emitted following a neutrino interaction are detected by digital optical modules deployed along vertical strings within the ice. The densely instrumented bottom central region of the IceCube detector, known as DeepCore, is optimized to detect GeV-scale atmospheric neutrinos. As upward-going atmospheric neutrinos pass through Earth, matter effects alter their oscillation probabilities due to coherent forward scattering with ambient electrons. These matter effects depend upon the energy of neutrinos and the density distribution of electrons they encounter during their propagation. Using simulated data at the IceCube Deepcore equivalent to its 9.3 years of observation, we demonstrate that atmospheric neutrinos can be used to probe the broad features of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. In this contribution, we present the preliminary sensitivities for establishing the Earth matter effects, validating the non-homogeneous distribution of Earth’s electron density, and measuring the mass of Earth. Further, we also show the DeepCore sensitivity to perform the correlated density measurement of different layers incorporating constraints on Earth’s mass and moment of inertia.</p>

<p>2025-02-26, <strong>Dark Matter and Neutrino Phenomenology in Doublet Left-Right Symmetric Model</strong>, Ankita Kakoti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18869v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.18869v1</a></p>

<p>Considering the fact that no Standard Model (SM) particle can account as a suitable dark matter candidate in the relevant studies, several Beyond Standard Model (BSM) frameworks incorporate within itself some extra fields depending upon the model taken into account. Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) is one such BSM framework which can successfully explain the origin of neutrino masses and also give an elaborative elucidation of the associated phenomenology like Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$, Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV), baryogenesis via leptogenesis etc. However, in spite of the presence of several new fields within the model, none of them can stand as a suitable dark matter candidate. This compels us to extend LRSM with extra scalars or fermions depending upon the type of study to be taken into account. In the current work, we extend LRSM with a sterile fermion per generation and the lightest of which acts as the Dark Matter (DM) candidate. The realization of the model has been done using modular symmetry, where we have used modular group $\Gamma(3)$ of weight 2 which is isomorphic to non-abelian discrete symmetry group $A_{4}$. We have then calculated the relic abundance as well the decay rate of the corresponding DM candidate and also studied $0\nu\beta\beta$ and LFV within the model and the results have been discussed in detail within the manuscript.</p>

<p>2025-02-26, <strong>The End of Easy Phenomenology for CMB Experiments: A Case Study in the Dark Sector</strong>, Cynthia Trendafilova et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19383v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.19383v1</a></p>

<p>The precision of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments, specifically its lensing reconstruction, has reached the limit where non-linear corrections cannot be ignored. Neglecting these corrections results in biased constraints on cosmological parameters. In this work, we use lensing data from Planck and the South Pole Telescope third generation camera (SPT-3G) taken in 2018 to highlight the impact of these biases in two ways. First, we estimate the shifts due to ignoring non-linear corrections in $\Lambda$CDM. We find 0.2-0.6$\sigma$ shifts in the Dark Matter (DM) fraction, the Hubble constant, and the amplitude of matter fluctuations at $8 h^{-1}$ Mpc. Second, we estimate the loss in constraining power for not including data sensitive to non-linear corrections. As a case study, we consider two interacting DM models, for which such corrections are not readily available in existing CMB Boltzmann codes. The first one is DM interacting with baryons, while the second is DM interacting with Dark Radiation (DR). For the former case, when we add primary CMB data from SPT-3G 2018 observations, we find that constraints on model parameters improve by 10-20% compared to previous studies. However, we forecast a further 50% improvement on these constraints if one could include current or upcoming SPT-3G lensing data. For the case of DM interacting with DR, no meaningful constraints on the model parameters are found without including information from CMB lensing. We also highlight that the codes used to calculate non-linear corrections in $\Lambda$CDM, specifically HaloFit and HMCode, provide unstable results when improperly used for these extended models. These outcomes constitute a reason for caution if using CMB lensing data when constraining such models, as well as a motivation for estimating their non-linear corrections.</p>

<p>2025-02-26, <strong>Cosmological Magnetic Fields from Ultralight Dark Matter</strong>, Robert Brandenberger et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19310v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.19310v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a mechanism for the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales that is operative after recombination. An essential ingredient is an instability (of parametric resonance type) of the electromagnetic field driven by an oscillating pseudo-scalar dark matter field, $\phi$, that is coupled to the electromagnetic field tensor via a $\phi F \wedge F$ term in the Lagrangian of axion-electrodynamics. We find that magnetic fields larger than the observational lower bounds can be generated soon after recombination on scales of $1 {\rm{Mpc}}$.</p>

<p>2025-02-26, <strong>Search for oscillating fundamental constants using a paired detector and vibrational spectroscopy</strong>, René Oswald et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19248v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.19248v1</a></p>

<p>Ultralight dark matter (UDM) may manifest itself through oscillating fundamental constants of normal matter. These can be experimentally searched for by implementing two dissimilar oscillators producing a beat between their frequencies and analyzing the beat-frequency time series for the presence of any temporal oscillations. Typically, the time series of such a detector contains contributions from nonstationary noise. In order to reduce the influence of such noise we propose and demonstrate paired detectors: two nominally identical detectors whose signals are synchronously recorded. The cross-spectrum of the two individual beat time series is then analyzed for UDM signatures. This approach permits us to suppress spurious signals appearing in uncorrelated fashion in either detector. We furthermore demonstrate detectors that are based on a vibrational molecular transition, which are advantageous due to their larger sensitivity to oscillations of the nuclear masses. The analysis of 274 hours of data yielded improved bounds for the coupling constants of UDM to nuclear mass and to electron mass in the frequency ranges 10-500 Hz and 10-122 kHz, with improvement factors between 6 and 10. These bounds are currently the strongest. Similar bounds are obtained for the fine-structure constant. The present approach may be generalized to large ensembles of detectors.</p>

<p>2025-02-26, <strong>Central Velocity Dispersion being the Primary Driver of Abundance Patterns in Quenched Galaxies</strong>, Haixin Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18785v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.18785v1</a></p>

<p>The element abundances of galaxies provide crucial insights into their formation and evolution. Using high-resolution IFU data from the MaNGA survey, we analyze the central spectra (0-0.5 $R_{\rm e}$) of 1,185 quenched galaxies ($z = 0.012-0.15$) to study their element abundances and stellar populations. We employ the full-spectrum fitting code {\tt alf} to derive stellar ages and element abundances from synthetic spectra and empirical libraries. Our key findings are: (1) Central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_<em>$) is the most effective parameter correlating with (relative) element abundances, especially [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe], and [N/Fe], outperforming $M_\ast$ and $M_\ast/R_{\rm e}$. (2) When binned by $\sigma_</em>$, the relative abundances of Na, Mg, C, and N remain stable across different formation times ($T_{\rm form}$), suggesting these elements are primarily influenced by the burstiness of star formation (traced by $\sigma_<em>$) rather than prolonged evolutionary processes. (3) Fe and Ca show little variation with $\sigma_</em>$, indicating weaker sensitivity to $\sigma_<em>$-driven processes. However, $T_{\rm form}$ has a global influence on all elements, contributing to their overall chemical evolution, albeit secondary to $\sigma_</em>$ for most elements. These results support the primary role of $\sigma_*$ in shaping the abundance patterns, likely stemming from the connection between central massive black holes and possibly dark matter halos, which influences the burstiness of star formation histories.</p>

<h1 id="supernova-1">supernova (1)</h1>

<p>2025-02-26, <strong>Detection of [C\,{\sc i}] Emission in Nebular Spectra of a Peculiar Type Ia Supernova 2022pul</strong>, Jialian Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18900v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.18900v1</a></p>

<p>SN~2022pul gains special attention due to its possible origin of a super-Chandarsekhar-mass white dwarf explosion (or called a 03fg-like type Ia supernova), which shows prominent [O\,{\sc i}], [Ne\,{\sc i}], and [Ca\,{\sc ii}] lines in its late-time spectra taken at $\sim+$300 days after the peak brightness. In this paper, we present new optical observations for this peculiar object, extending up to over 500 days after the peak brightness. In particular, in the $t\approx+515$ days spectrum, we identified for the first time the presence of narrow emission from [C\,{\sc i}] $\lambda\lambda9824, 9850$, which appears asymmetric and quite similar to the accompanied [O\,{\sc i}] $\lambda6300$ line in strength and profile. Based on the violent merger model that accounts well for previous observations but leaves little carbon in the center of the ejecta, this carbon line can be reproduced by increasing the degree of clumping in the ejecta and setting the carbon mass the same as that of oxygen ($\sim$0.06 $M_{\odot}$) in the innermost region ($\lesssim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$). In principle, the central carbon could come from the secondary white dwarf (WD) if it is ignited when hit by the shockwave of the explosion of the primary WD and explodes as a Ca-rich supernova, whereas pure deflagration of a super-Chandarsekhar-mass WD can account for such unburnt carbon more naturally.</p>
