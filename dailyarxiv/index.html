<p>2024-10-15, <strong>The Radio Fundamental Catalogue. I. Astrometry</strong>, Leonid Petrov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11794v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.11794v1</a></p>

<p>We present the all-sky catalogue of absolute positions and estimates of correlated flux density of 21,942 compact radio sources determined from processing interferometric visibility data of virtually all VLBI observing sessions at 2 to 23 GHz from 72 programs suitable for absolute astrometry collected for 30 years. We used a novel technique of generation of a dataset of fused observables that allowed us to incorporate all available data in our analysis. The catalogue is the most complete and most precise to date. It forms the foundation and reference for positional astronomy, space geodesy, space navigation, population analysis of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and provides calibrators for phase-referencing for differential astrometry and VLBI astrophysical observations. Its accuracy was evaluated through a detailed accounting systematic errors, rigorous decimation tests, comparison of different datasets, and comparison with other catalogues. The catalogue samples preferentially the AGNs with a strong contemporary parsec-scale synchrotron emission. Its milliarcsecond level positional accuracy allows association of these AGNs with detections in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from low-frequency radio to gamma-rays and high energy neutrinos. We describe the innovative data processing and calibration technique in full detail, report the in depth analysis of random and systematic positional errors, and provide the list of associations with large surveys at different wavelengths.</p>

<p>2024-10-15, <strong>Constraints on neutrino-Majoron couplings using SN1987A data</strong>, Pilar Iváñez-Ballesteros et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11517v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.11517v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino decay to a lighter neutrino and a massless (pseudo)scalar Goldstone boson remains of wide interest, as in the search for ultralight dark matter or of neutrinoless double beta-decay, and for its implications in astrophysics and cosmology. Neutrino interactions with Majorons can affect the dynamics of supernovae and impact the emitted neutrino flux. Using a three-neutrino framework and detailed supernova simulations, we perform the first likelihood analysis of the 24 neutrino events from SN1987A, including nonradiative decay in matter to a massless (pseudo)scalar boson like a Majoron. Focusing on the induced spectral distortions, we present bounds on the neutrino-Majoron couplings, as a function of the lightest neutrino mass, that are either complementary or competitive with current ones.</p>

<p>2024-10-15, <strong>Molecular Quantum Control Algorithm Design by Reinforcement Learning</strong>, Anastasia Pipi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11839v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.11839v1</a></p>

<p>Precision measurements of polyatomic molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in a single, pure quantum state. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated in the case of a CaH$^+$ ion, with up to 96 thermally populated eigenstates and under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. We expect that the method developed, with physics-informed learning, will be directly implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</p>

<p>2024-10-15, <strong>Frequency shifts induced by light scalar fields</strong>, Christian Käding et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11567v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.11567v1</a></p>

<p>Light scalar fields are frequently used in modern physics, for example, as candidates for dark energy or dark matter. Open quantum dynamical effects, like frequency shifts, induced by such fields in probe particles used in interferometry experiments might open up new perspectives for constraining such models. In this article, we consider a probe scalar particle as a rough approximation for an atom in matter wave interferometry and discuss the frequency shifts induced by interactions with an environment comprising either one of two screened scalar field models: chameleons or symmetrons. For the $n=-4$ chameleon, we revise a previously obtained expression for the induced frequency shift, but confirm that it can likely not be used to obtain new constraints. However, for symmetrons, we find that induced frequency shifts have the potential to tightly constrain previously unreachable parts of the parameter space.</p>

<h1 id="supernova-3">supernova (3)</h1>

<p>2024-10-15, <strong>A First-look at Spatially-resolved Infrared Supernova Remnants in M33 with JWST</strong>, Sumit K. Sarbadhicary et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11821v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.11821v1</a></p>

<p>We present the first spatially-resolved infrared images of supernova remnants (SNRs) in M33 with the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST. We analyze 43 SNRs in four JWST fields: two covering central and southern M33 with separate NIRCam (F335M, F444W) and MIRI (F560W, F2100W) observations, one $\sim$5 kpc-long radial strip observed with MIRI F770W, and one covering the giant HII region NGC 604 with multiple NIRCam and MIRI broad/narrowband filters. Of the 21 SNRs in the MIRI field, we found three clear detections (i.e., identical infrared and \ha morphologies), and six partial-detections, implying a detection fraction of 43\% in these bands. In contrast, only one SNR (out of 16) is detectable in the NIRCam field. One of the SNRs, L10-080, is a potential candidate for having freshly-formed ejecta dust, based on its size and centrally-concentrated 21 \mum emission. Two SNRs near NGC 604 have strong evidence of molecular (H$_2$) emission at 4.7 \mum, making them the farthest known SNRs with visible molecular shocks. Five SNRs have F770W observations, with the smaller younger objects showing tentative signs of emission, while the older, larger ones have voids. Multi-wavelength data indicate that the clearly-detected SNRs are also among the smallest, brightest at other wavelengths (\ha, radio and X-ray), have the broadest line widths (H$\alpha$ FWHM$\sim$250-350 km/s), and the densest environments. No strong correlation with star-formation histories are seen, with the clearly-detected SNRs having both high-mass ($\sim$35 \Msun) and low-mass ($\lesssim$10 \Msun) progenitors.</p>

<p>2024-10-15, <strong>Cloud properties in simulated galactic winds</strong>, Orlando Warren et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11747v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.11747v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we investigate the properties of a population of cool clouds in simulated galaxy outflows. Using data from the CGOLS isolated galaxy simulations, we generate catalogues of $\sim 10^5$ clouds. We describe the impact of two different supernova feedback models – a centrally concentrated starburst and disk-wide distributed star formation – on the resulting cloud population. In both cases we find that the mass distribution function $dN/dM \propto M^{-2}$, in good agreement with model predictions of turbulent fragmentation. We explore how cloud properties change with distance from the galaxy and find no qualitative distinction between the two feedback modes, although significant quantitative differences exist in attributes such as the total number of clouds, their densities, etc. We further show that both internal cloud velocities and cloud-cloud relative velocities are described well by properties of turbulent motion, despite significant bulk radial velocities. Finally, we investigate the distribution of cloud sizes in the context of recent theoretical arguments about cloud survival in winds. We find that proposed cloud survival criteria are a good predictor of cloud survival, in both the case where clouds are primarily destroyed and the case where cloud growth occurs in the outflow.</p>

<p>2024-10-15, <strong>Hot Subdwarf Stars</strong>, Ulrich Heber et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11663v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.11663v1</a></p>

<p>Hot subdwarf (SD) stars are the stripped cores of red giant stars in transition to the white dwarf sequence. The B-type subdwarfs (sdB) are powered by helium fusion in the core, more evolved ones (sdO) by shell burning. Low mass SDs may evolve through this stage without any support by nuclear fusion. Because the loss of the giants’ envelopes is likely caused by mass transfer in binaries, hot SDs are test beds for close-binary evolution through stable and unstable Roche lobe overflow, common envelope formation and ejection as well as mergers. Many classes of hot SDs can be identified according to surface composition, binarity, magnetism, pulsation characteristics and population membership, including members of globular clusters. Observed binaries show a wide spread of orbital periods from 20 minutes to more than 1,000 days with white dwarf or main sequence companions. The closest systems qualify as type Ia supernova progenitors and LISA detectable gravitational wave sources. High-precision light curves from Kepler and TESS combined with radial velocity curves are used to derive masses, while asteroseismology adds information on the internal structure, slow rotation, and synchronization. Gaia’s parallax measurements now allow us to place the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and derive stellar parameters by combining them with multi-band photometry. The stellar radius can be determined to high precision this way. Newton’s law can then be used to derive masses if accurate surface gravities are available. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys will provide atmospheric parameters for large samples of stars, allowing the mass distributions for the diverse subtypes to be established. These are crucial for testing binary synthesis models and constraining poorly known parameters such as the common envelope efficiency as well as the critical threshold mass-ratio for mass transfer stability.</p>
