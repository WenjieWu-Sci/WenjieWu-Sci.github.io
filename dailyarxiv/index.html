<p>2025-03-13, <strong>Self-interacting neutrinos in light of recent CMB and LSS data</strong>, Adèle Poudou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10485v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.10485v1</a></p>

<p>We update constraints on a simple model of self-interacting neutrinos involving a heavy scalar mediator with universal flavor coupling. According to past literature, such a model is allowed by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, with some CMB and large-scale structure data even favoring a strongly-interacting neutrino (SI$\nu$) scenario over $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we re-evaluate the constraints on this model in light of the new Planck NPIPE data, DESI BAO data, and the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS) applied to BOSS data. We find that Planck NPIPE are more permissive to the SI$\nu$ scenario and that DESI data favor the SI$\nu$ over $\Lambda$CDM. However, when considering EFTofBOSS data, this mode is no longer preferred. Therefore, new DESI data analyzed under the EFTofLSS are particularly awaited to shed light on this disagreement.</p>

<p>2025-03-13, <strong>A search for sterile neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data</strong>, Lu Feng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10423v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.10423v1</a></p>

<p>Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to search for sterile neutrinos. In this study, we utilized the latest baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, combined with the cosmic microwave background data from Planck and the five-year supernova data from DES, to constrain the interacting dark energy (IDE) models involving both cases of massless and massive sterile neutrinos. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm de}$, $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$, $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm de}$, and $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm c}$, respectively. Our analysis indicates that the current data provide only a hint of the existence of massless sterile neutrinos (as dark radiation) at about the $1\sigma$ level. In contrast, no evidence supports the existence of massive sterile neutrinos. Furthermore, in IDE models, the inclusion of (massless/massive) sterile neutrinos has a negligible impact on the constraint of the coupling parameter $\beta$. The IDE model of $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$ with sterile neutrinos does not favor an interaction. However, the other three IDE models with sterile neutrinos support an interaction in which dark energy decays into dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-03-13, <strong>Does thermal leptogenesis in a canonical seesaw rely on initial memory?</strong>, Partha Kumar Paul et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10366v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.10366v1</a></p>

<p>It is a common lore that in the thermal leptogenesis in the type-1 seesaw scenario with the conventional hierarchy of heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the CP violating, out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest RHN ($N_1$) is the only relevant source of $B-L$ asymmetry. Any asymmetry produced by the heavier RHNs ($N_2$ and $N_3$) gets washed out by the lepton number violating processes mediated by $N_1$. In this paper, we examine this assumption comprehensively, considering decay and inverse decay processes as well as the inclusion of scatterings. We find that the above said assumption is true only if all the RHNs ($N_1, N_2$ and $N_3$) are in strong washout regime. However, we saw that, to satisfy the neutrino masses and mixing given by the low energy neutrino oscillation data, at most one of the RHNs can be in the weak washout regime. This leads to, if $N_1$ is in the weak washout regime, then the washout parameters of $N_2$ and $N_3$ can be chosen in such a way that the impact of $N_2$ and $N_3$ on the final $B-L$ asymmetry is relatively small. On the other hand, if $N_2$ or $N_3$ is in weak washout regime, then the asymmetry produced by them can affect the final $B-L$ asymmetry even if $N_1$ is in the strong washout regime, which we call the memory effect. We delineated the parameter space where the memory effect is significant.</p>

<p>2025-03-13, <strong>Energy Reconstruction of Non-fiducial Electron-Positron Events in the DAMPE Experiment Using Convolutional Neural Networks</strong>, Enzo Putti-Garcia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10521v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.10521v1</a></p>

<p>The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space-based Cosmic-Ray (CR) observatory with the aim, among others, to study Cosmic-Ray Electrons (CREs) up to 10 TeV. Due to the low CRE rate at multi-TeV energies, we aim to increasing the acceptance by selecting events outside the fiducial volume. The complex topology of non-fiducial events requires the development of a novel energy reconstruction method. We propose the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks for a regression task to recover an accurate estimation of the initial energy.</p>

<p>2025-03-13, <strong>Position Reconstruction in the DEAP-3600 Dark Matter Search Experiment</strong>, The DEAP Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10383v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.10383v1</a></p>

<p>In the DEAP-3600 dark matter search experiment, precise reconstruction of the positions of scattering events in liquid argon is key for background rejection and defining a fiducial volume that enhances dark matter candidate events identification. This paper describes three distinct position reconstruction algorithms employed by DEAP-3600, leveraging the spatial and temporal information provided by photomultipliers surrounding a spherical liquid argon vessel. Two of these methods are maximum-likelihood algorithms: the first uses the spatial distribution of detected photoelectrons, while the second incorporates timing information from the detected scintillation light. Additionally, a machine learning approach based on the pattern of photoelectron counts across the photomultipliers is explored.</p>

<p>2025-03-13, <strong>The self-interaction effects on the Kerr black hole superradiance and their observational implications</strong>, Ning Xie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10347v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.10347v1</a></p>

<p>Through the black hole (BH) superradiance, ultralight bosons can form dense clouds around rotating Kerr BHs. Certain ultralight bosons, such as axions and axion-like particles (promising dark matter candidates), naturally possess self-interactions, and thus may significantly modify the dynamics of the superradiance process. Previous studies on the detection or constraint of ultralight bosons through superradiance have largely neglected the self-interaction effects of bosons. In this work, we investigate the formation and evolution of self-interacting boson clouds in the full Kerr spacetime during BH superradiance. Using numerical methods, we compute the superradiant growth rate of boson clouds with self-interactions around Kerr BHs and quantitatively evaluate how the self-interaction strength of scalar bosons affects the growth rate. We also assess the evolution of the BH’s mass and spin. Our results reveal that, in addition to the superradiance-imposed upper bound on the boson cloud mass, self-interactions of ultralight bosons introduce a new, lower critical mass limit, beyond which the growth rate of the boson cloud approaches zero. This implies that the superradiance process terminates earlier when self-interactions are considered. Furthermore, we explore how self-interactions affect both the oscillation frequency of boson clouds in gravitational atoms and the frequency of gravitational wave (GW) emitted through cloud annihilation. The anticipated frequency shift could be detectable by the GW observatories. Given that self-interactions substantially alter the evolution of BH superradiance, their effects can significantly relax existing constraints on scalar boson models derived from superradiance. Taking the spin measurements from GW190412 and GW190517 as examples, we discuss the impact of self-interactions on constraint results in details.</p>

<p>2025-03-13, <strong>Optical+NIR analysis of a newly found Einstein ring at z$\sim$1 from the Kilo-Degree Survey: Dark matter fraction, total and dark matter density slope and IMF</strong>, Rui Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10180v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.10180v1</a></p>

<p>We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of a new bright blue Einstein ring in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) footprint: the Einstein ``blue eye’’. Spectroscopic data from X-Shooter at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) show that the lens is a typical early-type galaxy (ETG) at $z=0.9906$, while the background source is a Ly$\alpha$ emitter at $z=2.823$. The reference lens modeling was performed on a high-resolution $Y-$band adaptive-optics image from HAWK-I at VLT. Assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) total mass density profile, we inferred an Einstein radius $R_{Ein}=10.47 \pm 0.06$ kpc. The average slope of the total mass density inside the Einstein radius, as determined by a joint analysis of lensing and isotropic Jeans equations is $\gamma=2.14^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, showing no systematic deviation from the slopes of lower redshit galaxies, This can be the evidence of ETGs developing through dry mergers plus moderate dissipationless accretion. Stellar population analysis with 8-band ($gri$ZYJHK$s$) photometries from KiDS and VIKING shows that the total stellar mass of the lens is $M*=(3.95\pm 0.35)\times 10^{11} M_\odot$ (Salpeter Initial Mass Function, IMF), implying a dark matter fraction inside the effective radius to be $f_{\rm DM}=0.307\pm 0.151$. We finally explored the dark matter halo slope and found a strong degeneracy with the dynamic stellar mass. Dark matter adiabatic contraction is needed to explain the posterior distribution of the slope, unless IMF heavier than Salpeter is assumed.</p>

<p>2025-03-13, <strong>Ab Initio Framework of Electron-Phonon Coupling for Chiral Phonons with Giant Phonon Magnetic Moments in Magnetic Materials</strong>, Fuyi Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10160v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.10160v1</a></p>

<p>Chiral phonons, characterized by nonzero angular momenta and magnetic moments, have attracted extensive attention. However, this field remains severely limited due to the inability to accurately account for electron-phonon-coupling (EPC) effects for chiral phonons. Here, we resolve this challenge through developing an ab initio framework for computing EPC-driven phonon magnetic properties, applicable to all insulating and metallic materials. Our theory predicts a dramatic enhancement of phonon magnetic moments exceeding classical predictions by multiple orders, accompanied by distinct Zeeman splitting. Interestingly, these splittings induce observable topological gaps in phonon spectra of magnets, generating intrinsic phonon Chern states. Through first-principles calculations, we identify five topological phonon magnets with intrinsic phonon Chern states and also propose to detect low-energy neutral particles such as dark matters. This research not only establishes a computational framework for investigating EPC-driven phonon magnetic properties, but also provides a material design strategy for realizing topological phonon states in quantum magnetic materials.</p>

<p>2025-03-13, <strong>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey : Subaru/HSC-SSP weak-lensing mass measurements for the eRASS1 Galaxy Clusters</strong>, Nobuhiro Okabe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09952v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.09952v1</a></p>

<p>We perform individual weak-lensing (WL) mass measurements for 78 eROSITA’s first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) clusters in the footprint of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) S19A, without any priors of the eRASS1 X-ray quantities or assumption of the mass and concentration relation. In the sample, we find 3 clusters are mis-associated with optical counterparts and 12 clusters are poorly fitted with an NFW profile. The average mass for the 12 poor-fit clusters changes from $\sim 10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ to $\sim 2\times 10^{13}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ when lensing contamination from surrounding mass structures is taken into account. The scaling relations between the true mass and cluster richness and X-ray count-rate agree well with the results of the eRASS1 Western Galactic Hemisphere region based on count-rate-inferred masses, which are calibrated with the HSC-SSP, DES, and KiDS surveys. We develop a Bayesian framework for inferring the mass-concentration relation of the cluster sample, explicitly incorporating the effects of weak-lensing mass calibration in the mass-concentration parameter space. The redshift-dependent mass and concentration relation is in excellent agreement with predictions of dark-matter-only numerical simulations and previous studies using X-ray-selected clusters. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) WL analysis, the offsets between the WL-determined centers and the X-ray centroids for 36 eRASS1 clusters with high WL S/N are described by two Gaussian components. We find that the mis-centering effect with X-ray centroids is smaller than that with peaks in the galaxy maps. The projected halo ellipticity is $\langle \varepsilon \rangle=0.45$ at $M_{200}\sim 4\times10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$, in agreement with results of numerical simulations and previous studies of clusters more than twice our mass.</p>

<p>2025-03-13, <strong>Simulating the shaping of point-symmetric structures in the jittering jets explosion mechanism</strong>, Jessica Braudo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10326v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.10326v1</a></p>

<p>We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of core-collapse supernovae by launching several pairs of jets into a collapsing core model and show that the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) can form a point-symmetric morphology that accounts for observed morphologies of many core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) remnants. Point-symmetric morphologies are composed of pairs of opposite structures around the center of the CCSN remnant. In the JJEM, the newly born neutron star launches several to a few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions, and these jets explode the star. In the simulations with the FLASH numerical code, we launch pairs of jets with varying directions, energies, opening angles, and durations into the massive stellar core and follow their evolution for about two seconds. We show that the jets form pairs of opposite filaments, clumps, bubbles, and lobes, namely, prominent point-symmetric morphologies. The interaction of the jets with the core leads to vigorous Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and excites many vortices, which also shape clumps and filaments. Our results strengthen the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</p>
