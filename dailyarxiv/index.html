<p>SBND is the near detector of the Short-Baseline Neutrino program at Fermilab. Its location near to the Booster Neutrino Beam source and relatively large mass will allow the study of neutrino interactions on argon with unprecedented statistics. This paper describes the expected performance of the SBND photon detection system, using a simulated sample of beam neutrinos and cosmogenic particles. Its design is a dual readout concept combining a system of 120 photomultiplier tubes, used for triggering, with a system of 192 X-ARAPUCA devices, located behind the anode wire planes. Furthermore, covering the cathode plane with highly-reflective panels coated with a wavelength-shifting compound recovers part of the light emitted towards the cathode, where no optical detectors exist. We show how this new design provides a high light yield and a more uniform detection efficiency, an excellent timing resolution and an independent 3D-position reconstruction using only the scintillation light. Finally, the whole reconstruction chain is applied to recover the temporal structure of the beam spill, which is resolved with a resolution on the order of nanoseconds.</p>

<p>Spread complexity measures the minimized spread of quantum states over all choices of basis. It generalizes Krylov operator complexity to quantum states under continuous Hamiltonian evolution. In this paper, we study spread complexity in the context of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and propose a new flavor ratio based on complexity. Our findings indicate that our proposal might favor an initial ratio of fluxes as $\phi_{\nu_e}^0: \phi_{\nu_\mu}^0: \phi_{\nu_\tau}^0 = 1:0:0$ over a more generally expected ratio of $1:2:0$, when the IceCube neutrino observatory achieves its projected sensitivity to discriminate between flavors. Additionally, complexity-based definitions of flavor ratios exhibit a slight but nonzero sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, which traditional flavor ratios cannot capture.</p>

<p>Sterile neutrinos that couple to the Standard Model via the neutrino magnetic dipole portals have been extensively studied at various experiments. In this work, we scrutinize these interactions for sterile neutrinos in the mass range of $\unit[0.1]{}-\unit[50]{MeV}$ through the nuclear and electron recoils at various neutrino scattering experiments. For the $e$-flavor specific dipole portal, we demonstrate that Dresden-II can provide leading constraints for $m_N \lesssim \unit[0.5]{MeV}$, setting aside currently unresolved theoretical uncertainties. For the $\mu$-flavor case, we show that the COHERENT experiment can probe a unique parameter region for $m_N$ in the range of $\unit[10]{}-\unit[40]{MeV}$ with the full dataset collected by the CsI[Na] scintillation detector, including both the energy and timing structure of the neutrino beam. We also present limits on the parameter regions of the $\tau$-flavor dipole portal using measurements of the solar neutrino flux from dark matter direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>Several extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of sub-GeV particles that can be copiously produced in the cores of supernovae. A broad family of these particles are dubbed feebly interacting particles (FIPs), which can have masses of up to a few hundreds of MeV. Here, we review the most recent and leading constraints on electrophilic FIPs, describing multimessenger techniques that allow us to probe the full phenomenology of the electron/positron emission produced by these FIPs; from their associated X-ray emission to the production of the $511$~keV line. Furthermore, the approach described here is independent of the specific particle model and can be translated to the coupling and other properties of a variety of different particles, such as axion-like particles, sterile neutrinos or dark photons</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>The New Worlds Simulations: Large-scale Simulations across Three Cosmologies</strong>, Katrin Heitmann et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07276v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07276v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper we describe the set of ``New Worlds Simulations’’, three very large cosmology simulations, Qo’noS, Vulcan, and Ferenginar, that were carried out on the Summit supercomputer with the Hardware/Hybrid Cosmology Code, HACC. The gravity-only simulations follow the evolution of structure in the Universe by each employing 12,288^3 particles in (3 Gpc/h)^3 volumes, leading to a mass resolution of m_p~10^9 Msun/h. The simulations cover three different cosmologies, one LambdaCDM model, consistent with measurements from Planck, one simulation with massive neutrinos, and one simulation with a varying dark energy equation of state. All simulations have the same phases to allow a detailed comparison of the results and the investigation of the impact of different cosmological parameters. We present measurements of some basic statistics, such as matter power spectra, correlation function, halo mass function and concentration-mass relation and investigate the differences due to the varying cosmologies. Given the large volume and high resolution, these simulations provide excellent bases for creating synthetic skies. A subset of the data is made publicly available as part of this paper.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Superscaling analysis of inclusive electron and (anti)neutrino scattering within the coherent density fluctuation model</strong>, M. V. Ivanov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07190v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07190v1</a></p>

<p>The experimental data from quasielastic electron and (anti)neutrino scattering on $^{12}$C are reanalyzed in terms of a new scaling variable $\psi^<em>$ suggested by the interacting relativistic Fermi gas with scalar and vector interactions, which is known to generate a relativistic effective mass for the interacting nucleons. We construct a new scaling function $f^\text{QE}(\psi^</em>)$ for the inclusive lepton scattering from nuclei within the coherent density fluctuation model (CDFM). The latter is a natural extension of the relativistic Fermi gas model to finite nuclei. In this work, on the basis of the scaling function obtained within CDFM with a relativistic effective mass $m_N^* =0.8 m_N$, we calculate and compare the theoretical predictions with a large set of experimental data for inclusive ($e,e’$) and (anti)neutrino cross sections. The model also includes the contribution of weak two-body currents in the two-particle two-hole sector, evaluated within a fully relativistic Fermi gas. Good agreement with experimental data is found over the whole range of electron and (anti)neutrino energies.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>On Lepton and Baryon Numbers as Local Gauge Symmetries</strong>, Pavel Fileviez Perez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06866v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06866v1</a></p>

<p>A simple theory where the total lepton number is a local gauge symmetry is proposed. In this context, the gauge anomalies are cancelled with the minimal number of extra fermionic fields and one predicts that the neutrinos are Majorana fermions. The properties of the neutrino sector are discussed showing that this theory predicts a $3+2$ light neutrino sector. We show that using the same fermionic fields one can gauge the baryon number and define a simple theory where the lepton and baryon numbers can be spontaneously broken at the low scale in agreement with experiments.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Exploring flavour space of an economical SU(5) GUT in future proton decay measurements</strong>, Gao-Xiang Fang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06861v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06861v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the potential of future proton decay experiments on the exploration of the flavour space of grand unification. We focus on an economical SU(5) grand unified model (GUT) with the fermion sector extended by including only one copy of 24-plet. Neutrino masses are generated via type-(I+III) seesaw mechanism with the lightest neutrino massless. Gauge unification requires masses of fermions in the 24-plet to be hierarchical, in particular, the electroweak singlet and triplet heavy leptons to be around the canonical seesaw scale and TeV scale, respectively. We address how extra parameters in the flavour space which cannot be touched in flavour measurements can be tested by a multi-channel analysis in future proton decay measurements.</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>Theory of neutrino fast flavor evolution. I. Linear response theory and stability conditions</strong>, Damiano F. G. Fiorillo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06708v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06708v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino-neutrino refraction leads to collective flavor evolution that can include fast flavor conversion, an ingredient still missing in numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae. We provide a theoretical framework for the linear regime of this phenomenon using the language of response theory. In analogy to electromagnetic waves, we introduce a flavor susceptibility as the linear response to an external flavor field. By requiring self-consistency, this approach leads to the usual dispersion relation for growing modes, but differs from the traditional treatment in that it predicts Landau damping of subluminal collective modes. The new dispersion relation has definite analyticity properties and can be expanded for small growth rates. This approach simplifies and intuitively explains Morinaga’s proof of sufficiency for the occurrence of growing modes. We show that weakly growing modes arise as soon as an angular crossing is formed, due to their resonant interaction with individual neutrino modes. For longitudinal plasma waves, a similar resonance causes Landau damping or conversely, the two-stream instability.</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>Search for neutrino emission from hard X-ray AGN with IceCube</strong>, R. Abbasi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06684v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06684v1</a></p>

<p>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are promising candidate sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos since they provide environments rich in matter and photon targets where cosmic ray interactions may lead to the production of gamma rays and neutrinos. We searched for high-energy neutrino emission from AGN using the $\textit{Swift}$-BAT Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) catalog of hard X-ray sources and 12 years of IceCube muon track data. First, upon performing a stacked search, no significant emission was found. Second, we searched for neutrinos from a list of 43 candidate sources and found an excess from the direction of two sources, Seyfert galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 4151. We observed NGC 1068 at flux $\phi_{\nu_{\mu}+\bar{\nu}_{\mu}}$ = $4.02_{-1.52}^{+1.58} \times 10^{-11}$ TeV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ normalized at 1 TeV, with power-law spectral index, $\gamma$ = 3.10$^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, consistent with previous IceCube results. The observation of a neutrino excess from the direction of NGC 4151 is at a post-trial significance of 2.9$\sigma$. If interpreted as an astrophysical signal, the excess observed from NGC 4151 corresponds to a flux $\phi_{\nu_{\mu}+\bar{\nu}_{\mu}}$ = $1.51_{-0.81}^{+0.99} \times 10^{-11}$ TeV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ normalized at 1 TeV and $\gamma$ = 2.83$^{+0.35}_{-0.28}$.</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>The Spectra of IceCube Neutrino (SIN) candidate sources – V. Modeling and interpretation of multiwavelength and neutrino data</strong>, Xavier Rodrigues et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06667v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06667v1</a></p>

<p>A correlation has been reported between the arrival directions of high-energy IceCube events and gamma-ray blazars classified as intermediate- and high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs. Subsequent studies have investigated the optical properties of these sources, analyzed public multiwavelength data, and constrained their individual neutrino emission based on public IceCube data. In this work, we provide a theoretical interpretation of public multiwavelength and neutrino point source data for the 32 BL Lac objects in the sample previously associated with an IceCube alert event. We have performed particle interaction modeling using open-source numerical simulation software. We constrained the model parameters using a novel and unique approach that simultaneously describes the host galaxy contribution, the observed synchrotron peak, the multiwavelength fluxes, and the IceCube point source constraints. We show that a single-zone leptohadronic model can describe the multiwavelength fluxes from the 32 IceCube candidates. In some cases, the model suggests that hadronic emission may contribute a considerable fraction of the gamma-ray flux. The required power in relativistic protons ranges from a few percent to a factor of ten of the Eddington luminosity, which is energetically less demanding compared to other leptohadronic blazar models in recent literature. The model can describe the 68% confidence level IceCube flux for a large fraction of the masquerading BL Lacs in the sample, including TXS 0506+056; whereas, for true BL Lacs, the model predicts a low neutrino flux in the IceCube sensitivity range. The predicted neutrino flux peaks between a few PeV and 100 PeV and scales positively with the flux in the GeV, MeV, X-ray, and optical bands. Based on these results, we provide a list of the brightest neutrino emitters, which can be used for future searches targeting the 10-100 PeV regime.</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>Searching for Pseudo-Dirac neutrinos from Astrophysical sources in IceCube data</strong>, Khushboo Dixit et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06476v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06476v1</a></p>

<p>We analyze IceCube public data from its IC86 configuration, namely PSTracks event selection, to search for pseudo-Dirac signatures in high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. Neutrino flux from astrophysical sources is reduced in the pseudo-Dirac scenario due to conversion of active-to-sterile neutrinos as compared to the neutrino oscillation scenario of only three active neutrinos over astrophysical distances. We fit IceCube data using astrophysical flux models for three point-like sources in both scenarios and constrain the active-sterile mass-square-difference in the absence of any evidence for pseudo-Dirac scenario. We find that a common mass-squared-difference $\delta m^2$ for all three flavors can be constrained as $\delta m^2 \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-19}~eV^2$ for the source NGC 1068, $\delta m^2 \lesssim 8 \times 10^{-20}~eV^2$ for the source TXS 0506+056, and $\delta m^2 \lesssim 2.3 \times 10^{-21}~eV^2$ for the source PKS 1424+240 at 90% C.L. A stacking analysis gives a constrain on $\delta m^2 \le 2.3 \times 10^{-21}~eV^2$ at 90% CL which is dominated by the constraint obtained from PKS 1424+240.</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>Nuclear Reactor Data Excludes Cosmological Triangle in Search for Axion-Like Particles</strong>, Byung Ju Park et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06117v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06117v1</a></p>

<p>We report new constraints on axion-like particle (ALP) using data corresponding to a sodium iodine target exposure of 3063\,kg$\cdot$days from the neutrino elastic scattering observation with NaI (NEON) experiment. A 16.7\,kg of thallium-doped sodium iodide target was located 23.7 meters from a 2.8\,GW thermal power nuclear reactor. We searched for ALPs produced by high-flux photons by comparing the energy spectra of data collected during reactor-on (1596\,kg$\cdot$days exposure) and reactor-off (1467\,kg$\cdot$days exposure) periods. No signal consistent with ALP interaction was identified, allowing us to set exclusion limits at the 95\% confidence level. Our limits cover previously unexplored regions for both photon couplings (${g_{a\gamma}}$) and electron couplings (${g_{ae}}$) for axion masses around 1\,MeV/c$^2$. Notably, the NEON data excludes the unconstrained region identified by laboratory-based searches for photon couplings within the ``cosmological triangle’’ for the first time. The observed 95\% confidence level limits reach as low as ${g_{a\gamma}}$ of 4.33$\times$ 10$^{-8}$\,GeV$^{-1}$ and ${g_{ae}}$ of 1.10$\times$ 10$^{-9}$ for axion masses of 1.7\,MeV/c$^2$ and 1.0\,MeV/c$^2$, respectively.</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>Fisher’s Mirage: Noise Tightening of Cosmological Constraints in Simulation-Based Inference</strong>, Christopher Wilson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06067v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06067v1</a></p>

<p>We systematically analyze the implications of statistical noise within numerical derivatives on simulation-based Fisher forecasts for large scale structure surveys. Noisy numerical derivatives resulting from a finite number of simulations, $N_{sims}$, act to bias the associated Fisher forecast such that the resulting marginalized constraints can be significantly tighter than the noise-free limit. We show the source of this effect can be traced to the influence of the noise on the marginalization process. Parameters such as the neutrino mass, $\M$, for which higher-order forward differentiation schemes are commonly used, are more prone to noise; the predicted constraints can be akin to those purely from a random instance of statistical noise even using $(1\mathrm{Gpc}/h)^{3}$ simulations with $N_{sims}=500$ realizations. We demonstrate how derivative noise can artificially reduce parameter degeneracies and seemingly null the effects of adding nuisance parameters to the forecast, such as HOD fitting parameters. We mathematically characterize these effects through a full statistical analysis, and demonstrate how confidence intervals for the true noise-free, $N_{sims} \rightarrow \infty$, Fisher constraints can be recovered even when noise comprises a consequential component of the measured signal. The findings and approaches developed here are important for ensuring simulation-based analyses can be accurately used to assess upcoming survey capabilities.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Transforming a rare event search into a not-so-rare event search in real-time with deep learning-based object detection</strong>, J. Schueler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07538v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07538v1</a></p>

<p>Deep learning-based object detection algorithms enable the simultaneous classification and localization of any number of objects in image data. Many of these algorithms are capable of operating in real-time on high resolution images, attributing to their widespread usage across many fields. We present an end-to-end object detection pipeline designed for real-time rare event searches for the Migdal effect, using high-resolution image data from a state-of-the-art scientific CMOS camera in the MIGDAL experiment. The Migdal effect in nuclear scattering, crucial for sub-GeV dark matter searches, has yet to be experimentally confirmed, making its detection a primary goal of the MIGDAL experiment. Our pipeline employs the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and is trained on real data to enhance the detection efficiency of nuclear and electronic recoils, particularly those exhibiting overlapping tracks that are indicative of the Migdal effect. When deployed online on the MIGDAL readout PC, we demonstrate our pipeline to process and perform the rare event search on 2D image data faster than the peak 120 frame per second acquisition rate of the CMOS camera. Applying these same steps offline, we demonstrate that we can reduce a sample of 20 million camera frames to around 1000 frames while maintaining nearly all signal that YOLOv8 is able to detect, thereby transforming a rare search into a much more manageable search. Our studies highlight the potential of pipelines similar to ours significantly improving the detection capabilities of experiments requiring rapid and precise object identification in high-throughput data environments.</p>

<p>The Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder survey continues to demonstrate the feasibility of line-intensity mapping using high-redshift carbon monoxide (CO) line emission traced at cosmological scales. The latest COMAP Pathfinder power spectrum analysis is based on observations through the end of Season 2, covering the first three years of Pathfinder operations. We use our latest constraints on the CO(1-0) line-intensity power spectrum at $z\sim3$ to update corresponding constraints on the cosmological clustering of CO line emission and thus the cosmic molecular gas content at a key epoch of galaxy assembly. We first mirror the COMAP Early Science interpretation, considering how Season 2 results translate to limits on the shot noise power of CO fluctuations and the bias of CO emission as a tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution. The COMAP Season 2 results place the most stringent limits on the CO tracer bias to date, at $\langle{Tb}\rangle&lt;4.8$ $\mu$K. These limits narrow the model space significantly compared to previous CO line-intensity mapping results while maintaining consistency with small-volume interferometric surveys of resolved line candidates. The results also express a weak preference for CO emission models used to guide fiducial forecasts from COMAP Early Science, including our data-driven priors. We also consider directly constraining a model of the halo-CO connection, and show qualitative hints of capturing the total contribution of faint CO emitters through the improved sensitivity of COMAP data. With continued observations and matching improvements in analysis, the COMAP Pathfinder remains on track for a detection of cosmological clustering of CO emission.</p>

<p>The operation of the next generation of gamma-ray observatories will lead to a great advance in dark matter searches. In this paper, we use the hidden sectors hypothesis within the so-called secluded models to calculate the capabilities of the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) to detect gamma-ray signatures produced by dark matter particles concentrated in the Sun. We assume the dark matter particle annihilates into metastable mediators which decay into $\gamma\gamma$, $e^+e^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $\bar{b}b$ outside the Sun. We found that the SWGO will be able to probe a spin-dependent cross-section of about $10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for dark matter masses smaller than 5 TeV. This result shows an unprecedented sensitivity surpassing the current instruments by more than one order of magnitude.</p>

<p>Because of their extreme densities and consequently, gravitational potential, compact objects such as neutron stars can prove to be excellent captors of dark matter particles. Considering purely gravitational interactions between dark and hadronic matter, we construct dark matter admixed stars composed of two-fluid matter subject to current astrophysical constraints of maximum mass and tidal deformability. We choose a wide range of parameters to construct the dark matter equation of state, and the DDME2 parameterization for the hadronic equation of state. We then examine the effect of dark matter on the stellar structure, tidal deformability and non-radial modes considering the relativistic Cowling approximation. We find the effect on $p$-modes is substantial, with frequencies decreasing up to the typical $f-$mode frequency range for most stars with a dark matter halo. The effects on the $f-$mode frequency are less extreme. Finally, we find the most probable and $1\sigma$ values of the dark matter parameters used in this study.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Search for photons above 10$^{18}$ eV by simultaneously measuring the atmospheric depth and the muon content of air showers at the Pierre Auger Observatory</strong>, The Pierre Auger Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07439v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07439v1</a></p>

<p>The Pierre Auger Observatory is the most sensitive instrument to detect photons with energies above $10^{17}$ eV. It measures extensive air showers generated by ultra high energy cosmic rays using a hybrid technique that exploits the combination of a fluorescence detector with a ground array of particle detectors. The signatures of a photon-induced air shower are a larger atmospheric depth of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$) and a steeper lateral distribution function, along with a lower number of muons with respect to the bulk of hadron-induced cascades. In this work, a new analysis technique in the energy interval between 1 and 30 EeV (1 EeV = $10^{18}$ eV) has been developed by combining the fluorescence detector-based measurement of $X_{max}$ with the specific features of the surface detector signal through a parameter related to the air shower muon content, derived from the universality of the air shower development. No evidence of a statistically significant signal due to photon primaries was found using data collected in about 12 years of operation. Thus, upper bounds to the integral photon flux have been set using a detailed calculation of the detector exposure, in combination with a data-driven background estimation. The derived 95% confidence level upper limits are 0.0403, 0.01113, 0.0035, 0.0023, and 0.0021 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ above 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 EeV, respectively, leading to the most stringent upper limits on the photon flux in the EeV range. Compared with past results, the upper limits were improved by about 40% for the lowest energy threshold and by a factor 3 above 3 EeV, where no candidates were found and the expected background is negligible. The presented limits can be used to probe the assumptions on chemical composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and allow for the constraint of the mass and lifetime phase space of super-heavy dark matter particles.</p>

<p>(abridged)Scalar field dark matter (SFDM) made of bosons has become a popular alternative to the CDM paradigm, especially for its potential to cure the so-called “small-scale problems” of CDM. Cosmological simulations have determined that SFDM halos exhibit a core-envelope structure, but they are computationally expensive. Halo cores have been found to be well approximated by “solitons”. The study of single soliton and multiple soliton merger dynamics constitutes a more feasible approach to investigate in detail the genuine quantum dynamics of SFDM and its interplay with self-gravity for a multitude of free boson parameters. In this paper, we present dedicated simulations of single solitons and binary soliton mergers, for models without and with a 2-boson, repulsive, weak to intermediate self-interaction (SI), as well as multiple soliton mergers without SI. We adapt the open-source code Pyultralight to simulate solitons with SI. We derive numerical scaling relations between the central density and mass of solitons for several values of SI and find deviations from the monotonic relations known from fuzzy dark matter (no SI), or the strongly repulsive Thomas-Fermi regime. Solitons with SI exemplify larger cores and lower central densities, compared to solitons without SI. Using our simulations, we extract numerical density profiles for solitons and post-merger objects, and fit them to analytic functions of previous literature. We find a mild preference for Gaussian cores for objects with SI, while the envelopes of post-mergers can be fit to NFW profiles albeit with some caution as we discuss. Similar to previous work, we find global, persistent oscillations for solitons as well as post-mergers, confirming that self-gravitating SFDM has very long relaxation times, although objects with SI exhibit oscillations of comparatively smaller amplitude.</p>

<p>We propose a novel neutron interferometry setup to explore the potential existence of mirror neutrons, a candidate for dark matter. Our work demonstrates that if mirror neutrons exist, neutrons will acquire an observable geometric phase due to mixing with these mirror counterparts. This geometric phase, detectable through our interferometric setup, could serve as a direct probe for the presence of mirror matter particles. Additionally, this investigation could shed light on unresolved issues in particle physics, such as the neutron lifetime puzzle. We discuss the setup’s versatility and limitations, showing its capability to explore a wide range of parameters in neutron interferometry and potentially uncover new physics.</p>

<p>In recent years, the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model, which has been pivotal in cosmological studies, has faced significant challenges due to emerging observational and theoretical inconsistencies. This paper explores alternative cosmological models to address these discrepancies, using simulated three years photometric Supernovae Ia data from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), supplemented with additional Pantheon+, Union, and the recently released Dark Energy Survey 5 Years (DESY5) supernova compilations and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. We assess the constraining power of these datasets on various dynamic dark energy models, including CPL, BA, JBP, SCPL, and GCG. Our analysis demonstrates that the LSST with its high precision data, can provide tighter constraints on dark energy parameters compared to other datasets. Additionally, the inclusion of BAO measurements significantly improves parameter constraints across all models.   Except for Pantheon+, we find that across all the cosmological datasets, and the dark energy models considered in this work, there is a consistent deviation from the LCDM model that exceeds a 2-sigma significance level. Our findings underscore the necessity of exploring dynamic dark energy models, which offer more consistent frameworks with fundamental physics and observational data, potentially resolving tensions within the LCDM paradigm. Furthermore, the use of simulated LSST data highlights the survey’s potential in offering significant advantages for exploring alternative cosmologies, suggesting that future LSST observations would play a crucial role.</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>Metal-Poor Stars in the MW Disk: Resonant Cooling of Vertical Oscillations of Halo Stars in Barred Galaxies</strong>, Xingchen Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06716v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06716v1</a></p>

<p>Using numerical simulations of a barred disk galaxy embedded in nonspinning and spinning dark matter (DM) halos, we present a novel mechanism of `cooling’ the vertical oscillations of halo DM particles, which acquire the disk kinematics. The underlying mechanism consists of resonant interactions between halo particles and the stellar bar. The cooling mechanism acts both on dynamical and secular timescales, i.e., from ~ 0.5 Gyr to few Gyr, and the stellar bar acts to absorb the kinetic energy of the vertical motions. Using a Milky Way-type stellar halo, we estimate the population of metal-poor disk stars which have been trapped by the MW disk and analyze its kinematics. We find that the population of metal-poor MW disk stars with $|z|\ltorder 3$\,kpc detected by the Gaia DR3 and other surveys can have their origin in the stellar halo. The cooled population also migrates radially outwards compared by acquiring energy from the spinning bar, and prograde-moving stars have a different distribution from the retrograde ones. Next, we have calculated the ratio of the prograde-to-retrograde orbits of the cooled population and found that this ratio varies radially, with the fast-spinning stellar halo resulting in the shallower radial increase of this ratio outside of the corotation. The nonspinning stellar halo shows a monotonic increase of this ratio with radius outside the corotation. Together with analyzed radial migration of these halo stars, the cooling phenomenon of halo metal-poor stars can explain their current disk population, and has corollaries for the chemical evolution of disk galaxies in general.</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>Inflaton Production of Scalar Dark Matter through Fluctuations and Scattering</strong>, Gongjun Choi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06696v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06696v1</a></p>

<p>We study the effects on particle production of a Planck-suppressed coupling between the inflaton and a scalar dark matter candidate, $\chi$. In the absence of this coupling, the dominant source for the relic density of $\chi$ is the long wavelength modes produced from the scalar field fluctuations during inflation. In this case, there are strong constraints on the mass of the scalar and the reheating temperature after inflation from the present-day relic density of $\chi$ (assuming $\chi$ is stable). When a coupling $\sigma \phi^2 \chi^2$ is introduced, with $\sigma = {\tilde \sigma} m_\phi^2/ M_P^2 \sim 10^{-10} {\tilde \sigma}$, where $m_\phi$ is the inflaton mass, the allowed parameter space begins to open up considerably even for ${\tilde \sigma}$ as small as $\gtrsim 10^{-7}$. For ${\tilde \sigma} \gtrsim \frac{9}{16}$, particle production is dominated by the scattering of the inflaton condensate, either through single graviton exchange or the contact interaction between $\phi$ and $\chi$. In this regime, the range of allowed masses and reheating temperatures is maximal. For $0.004 &lt; {\tilde \sigma} &lt; 50$, constraints from isocurvature fluctuations are satisfied, and the production from parametric resonance can be neglected.</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>The measurement of the splashback radius of dark matter halo</strong>, Weiwei Xu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06693v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06693v1</a></p>

<p>In the hierarchical evolution framework of cosmology, larger halos grow through matter accretion and halo mergers. To clarify the halo evolution, we need to define the halo mass and radius physically. However, the pseudo-evolution problem makes the process difficult. Thus, we aim to measure the splashback radius, a physically defined halo radius for a large number of halos with various mass and redshift, and to determine the most important parameters to affect it. We use the typical definition of splashback radius (Rsp) as the radius with the steepest radial density profile. In this work, we measure Rsp of dark matter halos within the mass of 1e13-3e15Msun and redshifts spanning 0.08-0.65. This is the measurement of the Rsp in the largest range of halo mass and redshift. Using the shear catalog of the DECaLS DR8, we investigate Rsp of halos associated with galaxies and galaxy clusters identified in the various catalogs. Our finding reveals a trend wherein massive halos demonstrate a larger Rsp, and the normalized splashback radius (Rsp/R200m) shows a U-shaped mass evolution. The upturn in these relations mainly comes from the contribution of massive halos with low redshifts. We further find Rsp increases with the peak height, while Rsp/R200m has a negative relation with the peak height. We also find the Rsp &gt;~R200m for most halos, indicating their low accretion rates. Our result is consistent with previous literature across a wide range of mass, redshift, and peak height, as well as the simulation work from More et al. (2015).</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>Dilatonic Couplings and the Relic Abundance of Ultralight Dark Matter</strong>, Ahmad Alachkar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06395v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06395v1</a></p>

<p>Models of scalar field dark matter where the scalar is a dilaton have a special behaviour, since non-trivial couplings, $d$, to matter result in a contribution to the potential for the field which is proportional to the trace of the stress-energy tensor. We look in more detail at the dilaton mass, $m_\phi$, and initial conditions required to yield the correct relic abundance for couplings that are not already excluded by terrestrial experiments. In minimal models with only couplings accessible to terrestrial searches, we find that dilaton dark matter with $m_{\phi} \gtrsim 10^{-10}$ eV requires couplings suppressed compared to constraints from equivalence principle (EP) tests and fifth force searches in order to not produce too much dark matter, improving on the strongest current experimental constraints by up to $\sim {\cal O}(10)$, with consequences for the proposed mechanical resonator dilaton DM searches. In non-minimal or universally coupled models, the unconstrained couplings of the dilaton to e.g. the top quark can strongly influence the relic abundance at all masses. In particular, this implies that atom interferometry searches at masses $m_\phi\approx 10^{-19}\text{ eV}$ are unable to constrain the early Universe behaviour or UV physics of the dilaton. We also find that dilatonic couplings allow for compatibility of $m_\phi \gtrsim 10^{-7}\text{ eV}$ with an observably large tensor-to-scalar ratio in the cosmic microwave background, which is not possible for a decoupled scalar of the same mass.</p>

<p>We discuss the appearance of topological structures from the spontaneous breaking of $E_6$ to the Standard Model via its maximal subgroup $SO(10) \times U(1)_\psi$. They include dumbbells, metastable strings, as well as domain walls bounded by necklaces. We provide a novel scenario for producing metastable strings based on the symmetry breaking $U(1)_\psi \longrightarrow Z_8 \longrightarrow Z_4$. The metastable string arises from the merger of $Z_8$ strings that bound a domain wall. An unbroken gauge $Z_2$ symmetry from $SO(10)$ breaking yields viable stable dark matter candidates as well as topologically stable strings. We discuss the gravitational wave emission from two varieties of cosmic strings, namely the superheavy metastable ones and the intermediate scale topologically stable cosmic strings.</p>

<p>We discuss quantization of Dirac spinors with action which is the negative of the standard action. Using the Keldysh QFT formulation, we show that the standard quantization of such Keldysh spinors results in the Hamiltonian bounded from above and in S-matrix for backwards in time scattering. The alternative quantization produces the standard Hamiltonian bounded from below and the standard S-matrix for forwards in time scattering. When the two masses are equal, the sum of their actions describes the standard Keldysh out-of-time-order correlators. When both Keldysh and Dirac spinors are present in a QFT, the standard Fock space is augmented by negative energy states, while its positive and the negative subspaces share the same vacuum state. In absence of gravity the Dirac and the Keldysh spinors do not interact and positive and negative energy states do not exchange quanta with non-zero energy. If Keldysh spinors exist in Nature, then the Universe would consist of bosonic and fermionic particles that are described by both positive and negative Fock energy states with a single vacuum state that cannot be crossed from either side. Such a scenario could explain the non-observation of dark energy/dark matter except via classical gravity.</p>

<p>When measuring the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scale from galaxy surveys, one typically assumes a fiducial cosmology when converting redshift measurements into comoving distances and also when defining input parameters for the reconstruction algorithm. A parameterised template for the model to be fitted is also created based on a (possibly different) fiducial cosmology. This model reliance can be considered a form of data compression, and the data is then analysed allowing that the true answer is different from the fiducial cosmology assumed. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the fiducial cosmology assumed in the BAO analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey Data Release 1 (DR1) on the final measurements in DESI 2024 III. We utilise a suite of mock galaxy catalogues with survey realism that mirrors the DESI DR1 tracers: the bright galaxy sample (BGS), the luminous red galaxies (LRG), the emission line galaxies (ELG) and the quasars (QSO), spanning a redshift range from 0.1 to 2.1. We compare the four secondary AbacusSummit cosmologies against DESI’s fiducial cosmology (Planck 2018). The secondary cosmologies explored include a lower cold dark matter density, a thawing dark energy universe, a higher number of effective species, and a lower amplitude of matter clustering. The mocks are processed through the BAO pipeline by consistently iterating the grid, template, and reconstruction reference cosmologies. We determine a conservative systematic contribution to the error of $0.1\%$ for both the isotropic and anisotropic dilation parameters $\alpha_{\rm iso}$ and $\alpha_{\rm AP}$. We then directly test the impact of the fiducial cosmology on DESI DR1 data.</p>

<p>We perform fits to DESI, CMB and supernova data to understand the physical origin of the DESI hint for dynamical dark energy. We find that the linear parametrization of the equation of state $w$ may guide to misleading interpretations, such as the hint for a phantom Universe, which are not preferred by the data. Instead, physical quintessence models fit the data well. Model-independently, present observations prefer deviations from the constant dark energy, $w=-1$, only at very low redshifts, $z &lt; \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We find that this result is driven by low-$z$ supernova data. Therefore, either the fundamental properties of our Universe, characterised by the equation of state $w$ and the Hubble parameter $H$, underwent dramatic changes very recently or, alternatively, we do not fully understand the systematics of our local Universe in a radius of about $300\,h^{-1}\rm Mpc$.</p>

<p>I critically review some claims in the paper ``Almost All Carbon/Oxygen White Dwarfs Can Support Double Detonations’’ (arXiv:2405.19417). The claim of that paper that the community converges on a leading scenario of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the double detonation scenario, is wrong, as hundreds of papers in recent years study five and more different SN Ia scenarios and their channels. Moreover, the finding by that paper that the double detonation scenario with the explosion of the secondary white dwarf (WD; the mass-donor WD) is common, i.e., the triple-detonation channel and the quadruple-detonation sub-channel, implies highly no-spherical explosions. The highly non-spherical explosions contradict the morphologies of many SN Ia remnants. I find that the results of that paper strengthen the claim that the double detonation scenario (with its channels) might account for a non-negligible fraction of peculiar SNe Ia but only for a very small fraction (or non at all) of normal SNe Ia.</p>

<p>We perform a comparative analysis of quintessence and $k$-essence scalar field models in the data analysis perspective. We study the quintessence field with an exponential potential and the $k$-essence field with an inverse square potential in the present work. Before delving into data analysis, we provide a brief perspective on dynamical evolution on both of the models and obtain the stability constraints on the model parameters. We adopt Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best-fit the data. A comprehensive analysis utilizing Observational Hubble data (OHD) and Pantheon+ compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) shows that $k$-essence model fits the data slightly better than the quintessence model while the evidence of these models in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model is weak. The value of the Hubble constant predicted by both the models is in close agreement with the value obtained by the Planck2018 collaboration assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model.</p>

<p>We present the results of a series of 3D special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet in a massive circumstellar medium (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. Our simulations reproduce the jet morphology transitioning from a well-collimated state to a thermal pressure-driven state for a range of CSM masses and outer radii. The jet-CSM interaction redistributes the jet energy to materials expanding into a wide solid angle and results in a quasi-spherical ejecta with 4-velocities from $\Gamma\beta\simeq 0.1$ to $\simeq 10$. The mass and kinetic energy of the ejecta with velocities faster than $0.1c$ are typically of the order of $0.1\,M_\odot$ and $10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$ with only a weak dependence on the CSM mass and radius for the explored CSM parameter ranges. We find that the numerically obtained density structure of the mildly relativistic ejecta is remarkably universal. The radial density profile is well approximated as a power-law function of the radial velocity with an index of $-5$, $\rho\propto v^{-5}$, in agreement with our previous simulations and other studies, as well as those suggested from recent studies on early-phase spectra of supernovae associated with GRBs. Such fast ejecta rapidly becomes transparent following its expansion. Gradually releasing the trapped thermal photons, the ejecta gives rise to bright UV–optical emission within $\sim 1$ day. We discuss the potential link of the relativistic ejecta resulting from jet-CSM interaction to GRB-associated supernovae as well as fast and blue optical transients.</p>

<p>Efforts to unveil the structure of the local interstellar medium and its recent star formation history have spanned the past seventy years. Recent studies utilizing precise data from space astrometry missions have revealed nearby, newly formed star clusters with connected origins. Nonetheless, mapping young clusters across the entire sky back to their natal regions has been hindered by a lack of clusters with precise radial velocity data. Here we show that 155 out of 272 (57 percent) high-quality young clusters within one kiloparsec of the Sun arise from three distinct spatial volumes. This conclusion is based upon the analysis of data from the third Gaia release and other large-scale spectroscopic surveys. Currently dispersed throughout the Solar Neighborhood, their past positions over 30 Myr ago reveal that these families of clusters each formed in one of three compact, massive star-forming complexes. One of these families includes all of the young clusters near the Sun – the Taurus and Sco-Cen star-forming complexes. We estimate that over 200 supernovae were produced from these families and argue that these clustered supernovae produced both the Local Bubble and the largest nearby supershell GSH 238+00+09, both of which are clearly visible in modern three-dimensional dust maps.</p>

<p>We propose a Bayesian inference framework to predict the merger history of LIGO-Virgo binary black holes, whose binary components may have undergone hierarchical mergers in the past. The framework relies on numerical relativity predictions for the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant black holes. This proposed framework computes the masses, spins, and kicks imparted to the remnant of the parent binaries, given the initial masses and spin magnitudes of the binary constituents. We validate our approach by performing an “injection study” based on a constructed sequence of hierarchically-formed binaries. Noise is added to the final binary in the sequence, and the parameters of the ‘parent’ and ‘grandparent’ binaries in the merger chain are then reconstructed. This method is then applied to three GWTC-3 events: GW190521, GW200220_061928, GW190426_190642. These events were selected because at least one of the binary companions lies in the putative pair-instability supernova mass gap, in which stellar processes alone cannot produce black holes. Hierarchical mergers offer a natural explanation for the formation of black holes in the pair-instability mass-gap. We use the backward evolution framework to predict the parameters of the parents of the primary companion of these three binaries. Our results indicate that at least one component of these three observed binaries was formed through a prior binary black hole merger. This approach can be readily applied to future high-mass gravitational wave events to predict their formation history under the hierarchical merger assumption.</p>

<p>Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Here, we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing frequentist profile likelihoods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES dataset at up to $2.5 \sigma$ level. At the highest redshifts, one encounters negative dark energy densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Evidence of Changing Dust Distributions With Redshift Using Type Ia Supernovae</strong>, B. Popovic et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06215v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06215v1</a></p>

<p>Type Ia supernova (SNIa) are excellent probes of local distance, and the increasing sample sizes of SNIa have driven an increased need to study the associated systematic uncertainties and improve the standardisation methods in preparation for the next generation of cosmological surveys into the dark energy equation-of-state $w$. We aim to probe the potential change in the SNIa standardisation parameter $c$ with redshift and the host-galaxy of the supernova. Improving the standardisation of SNIa brightnesses will require accounting for the relationship between the host and the SNIa, and potential shifts in the SNIa standardisation parameters with redshift will cause biases in the recovered cosmology. Here, we assemble a volume-limited sample of ~3000 likely SNIa across a redshift range of $z = 0.015$ to $z = 0.36$. This sample is fitted with changing mass and redshift bins to determine the relationship between intrinsic properties of SNe Ia and their redshift and host galaxy parameters. We then investigate the colour-luminosity parameter $\beta$ as a further test of the SNIa standardisation process. We find that the changing colour distribution of SNe Ia with redshift is driven by dust at a confidence of $&gt;4\sigma$. Additionally, we show a strong correlation between the host galaxy mass and the colour-luminosity coefficient $\beta$ ($&gt; 4\sigma$), even when accounting for the quantity of dust in a host galaxy.</p>

<p>2024-06-10, <strong>Multi-Generational Black Hole Population Analysis with an Astrophysically Informed Mass Function</strong>, Yannick Ulrich et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06109v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06109v1</a></p>

<p>We analyze the population statistics of black holes in the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog using a parametric mass function derived from simulations of massive stars experiencing pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISN). Our formalism enables us to separate the black hole mass function into sub-populations corresponding to mergers between objects formed via different astrophysical pathways, allowing us to infer the properties of black holes formed from stellar collapse and black holes formed via prior mergers separately. Applying this formalism, we find that this model fits the data better than the powerlaw+peak model with Bayes factor $ 9.7\pm0.1$. We measure the location of the lower edge of the upper black hole mass gap to be $M_{\rm BHMG}=84.05_{-12.88}^{+17.19}{\rm M}_{\odot}$, providing evidence that the $35{\rm M}_{\odot}$ Gaussian peak detected in the data using other models is not associated with the PPISN pile-up predicted to precede this gap. Incorporating spin, we find that the normalized spins of stellar remnant black holes are close to zero while those of higher generation black holes tend to larger values. All of these results are in accordance with the predictions of stellar structure theory and black hole merger scenarios. Finally, we combine our mass function with the spectral siren method for measuring the Hubble constant to find $H_0=36.19_{-10.91}^{17.50}$ km/s/Mpc and discuss potential explanations of this low value. Our results demonstrate how astrophysically-informed mass functions can facilitate the interpretation of gravitational wave catalog data to provide information about black hole formation and cosmology. Future data releases will improve the precision of our measurements.</p>
