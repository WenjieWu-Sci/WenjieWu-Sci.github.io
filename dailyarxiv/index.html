<p>2023-07-27, <strong>Exploring Freeze-out and Freeze-in Dark Matter via Effective Froggatt-Nielsen Theory</strong>, Rusa Mandal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14972v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14972v1</a></p>

<p>Motivated by the dynamical reasons for the hierarchical structure of the Yukawa sector of the Standard Model (SM), we consider an extension of the SM with a complex scalar field, known as `flavon’, based on the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. In an effective theory approach, the SM fermion masses and mixing patterns are generated in orders of the parameter related to the vacuum expectation value of the flavon field and the cut-off of the effective theory. By introducing right-handed neutrinos, we study the viability of the lightest right-handed neutrino as a dark matter candidate, where the same flavon field acts as a mediator between the dark and the SM sectors. We find that dark matter genesis is achieved both through freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms encompassing the $\mathcal{O}(\text{GeV})$ – $\mathcal{O}(\text{TeV})$ mass range of the mediator and the dark matter particle. In addition to tree-level spin-dependent cross section, the model gives rise to tree- and loop-level contributions to spin-independent scattering cross section at the direct detection experiments such as XENON and LUX-ZEPLIN which can be probed in their future upgrades. By choosing suitable Froggatt-Nielsen charges for the fermions, we also generate the mass spectrum of the SM neutrinos via the Type-I seesaw mechanism. Flavor-changing neutral current processes, such as radiative lepton decay, meson mixing, and top-quark decay remain the most constraining channels and provide testability for this minimal setup that addresses several major shortcomings of the SM.</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>Parity Solution to the Strong CP Problem and a Unified Framework for Inflation, Baryogenesis, and Dark Matter</strong>, K. S. Babu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14869v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14869v1</a></p>

<p>It has been known for some time that asymptotic parity invariance of weak interactions can provide a solution to the strong CP problem without the need for the axion. Left-right symmetric theories which employ a minimal Higgs sector consisting of a left-handed and a right-handed doublet is an example of such a theory wherein all fermion masses arise through a generalized seesaw mechanism. In this paper we present a way to understand the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry as well as the dark matter content of the universe in these theories using the Affleck-Dine (AD) leptogenesis mechanism and inflaton decay, respectively. Three gauge singlet fermions are needed for this purpose, two of which help to implement the Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses while the third one becomes the non-thermal warm dark matter candidate. A soft lepton number breaking term involving the AD scalar field is used to generate lepton asymmetry which suffers no wash-out effects and maintains the Dirac nature of neutrinos. This framework thus provides a unified description of many of the unresolved puzzles of the standard model that require new physics.</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>Observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Galactic plane</strong>, Stephen Sclafani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14842v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14842v1</a></p>

<p>IceCube has discovered a flux of astrophysical neutrinos and presented evidence for the first neutrino sources, a flaring blazar known as TXS 0506+056 and the active galaxy NGC 1068. However, the sources responsible for the majority of the astrophysical neutrino flux remain elusive. In addition to hypothetical sources within our Galaxy, high energy neutrinos are produced when cosmic rays interact at their acceleration sites and during propagation through the interstellar medium. The Galactic plane has therefore long been hypothesized as a neutrino source. In this contribution, new results are presented for searches of neutrino sources utilizing a dataset that builds upon recent advances in deep-learning-based reconstruction methods for neutrino-induced cascades. This work presents the first observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Milky Way Galaxy, rejecting the background-only hypothesis at 4.5$\sigma$. The neutrino signal is consistent with diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, potentially in combination with emission by a population of sources.</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>Angular dependence of the atmospheric neutrino flux with IceCube data</strong>, Leonora Kardum et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14728v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14728v1</a></p>

<p>IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the cubic kilometer detector embedded in ice of the geographic South Pole, is capable of detecting particles from several GeV up to PeV energies enabling precise neutrino spectrum measurement. The diffuse neutrino flux can be subdivided into three components: astrophysical, from extraterrestrial sources; conventional, from pion and kaon decays in atmospheric Cosmic Ray cascades; and the yet undetected prompt component from the decay of charmed hadrons. A particular focus of this work is to test the predicted angular dependence of the atmospheric neutrino flux using an unfolding method. Unfolding is a set of methods aimed at determining a value from related quantities in a model-independent way, eliminating the influence of several assumptions made in the process. In this work, we unfold the muon neutrino energy spectrum and employ a novel technique for rebinning the observable space to ensure sufficient event numbers within the low statistic region at the highest energies. We present the unfolded energy and zenith angle spectrum reconstructed from IceCube data and compare the result with model expectations and previous measurements.</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>Seasonal Variations of the Atmospheric Neutrino Flux measured in IceCube</strong>, Karolin Hymon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14724v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14724v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory measures high energy atmospheric neutrinos with high statistics. These atmospheric neutrinos are produced in cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere, mainly by the decay of pions and kaons. The rate of the measured neutrinos is affected by seasonal temperature variations in the stratosphere, which are expected to increase with the energy of the particle. In this contribution, seasonal energy spectra are obtained using a novel spectrum unfolding approach, the Dortmund Spectrum Estimation Algorithm (DSEA+), in which the energy distribution from 125 GeV to 10 TeV is estimated from measured quantities with machine learning algorithms. The seasonal spectral difference to the annual average flux will be discussed based on preliminary results from IceCube’s atmospheric muon neutrino data.</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>Multiplicity of TeV muons in extensive air showers detected with IceTop and IceCube</strong>, Stef Verpoest et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14689v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14689v1</a></p>

<p>We report on an analysis of the high-energy muon component in near-vertical extensive air showers detected by the surface array IceTop in coincidence with the in-ice array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. In the coincidence measurement, the predominantly electromagnetic signal measured by IceTop is used to estimate the cosmic-ray primary energy, and the energy loss of the muon bundle in the deep in-ice array is used to estimate the number of muons in the shower with energies above 500 GeV (“TeV muons”). The average multiplicity of these TeV muons is determined for cosmic-ray energies between 2.5 PeV and 100 PeV assuming three different hadronic interaction models: Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC. For all models considered, the results are found to be in good agreement with the expectations from simulations. A tension exists, however, between the high-energy muon multiplicity and other observables; most importantly the density of GeV muons measured by IceTop using QGSJet-II.04 and EPOS-LHC.</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>Final results of Borexino on CNO solar neutrinos</strong>, D. Basilico et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14636v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14636v1</a></p>

<p>We report the first measurement of CNO solar neutrinos by Borexino that uses the Correlated Integrated Directionality (CID) method, exploiting the sub-dominant Cherenkov light in the liquid scintillator detector. The directional information of the solar origin of the neutrinos is preserved by the fast Cherenkov photons from the neutrino scattered electrons, and is used to discriminate between signal and background. The directional information is independent from the spectral information on which the previous CNO solar neutrino measurements by Borexino were based. While the CNO spectral analysis could only be applied on the Phase-III dataset, the directional analysis can use the complete Borexino data taking period from 2007 to 2021. The absence of CNO neutrinos has been rejected with &gt;5{\sigma} credible level using the Bayesian statistics. The directional CNO measurement is obtained without an external constraint on the $^{210}$Bi contamination of the liquid scintillator, which was applied in the spectral analysis approach. The final and the most precise CNO measurement of Borexino is then obtained by combining the new CID-based CNO result with an improved spectral fit of the Phase-III dataset. Including the statistical and the systematic errors, the extracted CNO interaction rate is $R(\mathrm{CNO})=6.7^{+1.2}_{-0.8} \, \mathrm{cpd/100 \, tonnes}$. Taking into account the neutrino flavor conversion, the resulting CNO neutrino flux at Earth is $\Phi_\mathrm{CNO}=6.7 ^{+1.2}_{-0.8} \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$, in agreement with the high metallicity Standard Solar Models. The results described in this work reinforce the role of the event directional information in large-scale liquid scintillator detectors and open up new avenues for the next-generation liquid scintillator or hybrid neutrino experiments.</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>Cosmological neutrino N-body simulations of dark matter halo</strong>, Yu Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14621v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14621v1</a></p>

<p>The study of massive neutrinos and their interactions is a critical aspect of contemporary cosmology. Recent advances in parallel computation and high-performance computing provide new opportunities for accurately constraining Large-Scale Structures (LSS). In this paper, we introduce the TianNu cosmological N-body simulation during the co-evolution of massive neutrino and cold dark matter components via the CUBEP$^3$M code running on the supercomputer Tianhe-2 and TianNu’s connected works. We start by analyzing $2.537\times10^7$ dark halos from the scientific data of TianNu simulation, and compare their angular momentum with the matched halos from neutrino-free TianZero, revealing a dependence of angular momentum modulus on neutrino injection at scales below 50 Mpc and around 10 Mpc.</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>TXS 0506+056 with Updated IceCube Data</strong>, William Luszczak et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14559v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14559v1</a></p>

<p>Past results from the IceCube Collaboration have suggested that the blazar TXS 0506+056 is a potential source of astrophysical neutrinos. However, in the years since there have been numerous updates to event processing and reconstruction, as well as improvements to the statistical methods used to search for astrophysical neutrino sources. These improvements in combination with additional years of data have resulted in the identification of NGC 1068 as a second neutrino source candidate. This talk will re-examine time-dependent neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 using the most recent northern-sky data sample that was used in the analysis of NGC 1068. The results of using this updated data sample to obtain a significance and flux fit for the 2014 TXS 0506+056 “untriggered” neutrino flare are reported</p>

<p>2023-07-26, <strong>Identifying Spin Properties of Evaporating Black Holes through Asymmetric Neutrino and Photon Emission</strong>, Yuber F. Perez-Gonzalez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14408v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14408v1</a></p>

<p>Kerr black holes radiate neutrinos in an asymmetric pattern, preferentially in the lower hemisphere relative to the black hole’s rotation axis, while antineutrinos are predominantly produced in the upper hemisphere. Leveraging this asymmetric emission, we explore the potential of high-energy, $E_\nu \gtrsim 1$ TeV, neutrino and antineutrino detection to reveal crucial characteristics of an evaporating primordial black hole at the time of its burst when observed near Earth. We improve upon previous calculations by carefully accounting for the non-isotropic particle emission, as Earth occupies a privileged angle relative to the black hole’s rotation axis. Additionally, we investigate the angular dependence of primary and secondary photon spectra and assess the evaporating black hole’s time evolution during the final explosive stages of its lifetime. Although photon events outnumber neutrinos by about three orders of magnitude, we find that simultaneous measurements of these particles are indispensable for identifying the initial angular momentum and the black hole hemisphere facing Earth. This is particularly important for evaporating black holes within our solar system, at distances $\lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$ pc, and observed during the final 100 s of their lifetimes.</p>

<p>2023-07-26, <strong>Rescuing leptogenesis parameter space of inverse seesaw</strong>, Ananya Mukherjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14405v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14405v1</a></p>

<p>The generic inverse seesaw (ISS) framework is unable to produce an adequate amount of lepton asymmetry, which consequently fails to generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU). This happens due to mainly two reasons, (i) partial cancellation of the lepton asymmetries associated with the components of a pseudo-Dirac pair, and (ii) strong wash out caused by the inverse decays. In this work we offer two possible resolutions to overcome the above mentioned challenges considering a (3,3) ISS framework. Our first proposal is based on the assumption of a non-standard cosmological era in the pre-BBN epoch, that triggers a faster expansion of the Universe, thereby reducing the washout by several orders of magnitude. The second proposition is an alternative of first which considers a quasi-degenerate singlet heavy neutrino mass spectrum, resulting into a larger order of lepton asymmetry that survives the impact of strong washout to account for the observed BAU. The viable parameters space, as obtained can be tested at present and future Lepton Flavour Violation experiments {\it e.g.} MEG and MEG II.</p>

<p>2023-07-26, <strong>On the lensing impact on cosmic relics $\&amp;$ tensions</strong>, William Giarè et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14204v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14204v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmological bounds on neutrinos and additional hypothetical light thermal relics, such as QCD axions, are currently among the most restrictive ones. These limits mainly rely on Cosmic Microwave Background temperature anisotropies. Nonetheless, one of the largest cosmological signatures of thermal relics is that on gravitational lensing, due to their free streaming behavior before their non-relativistic period. We investigate late time only hot relic mass constraints, primarily based on recently released lensing data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, both alone and in combination with lensing data from the Planck Satellite. Additionally, we consider other local probes, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations measurements, shear-shear, galaxy-galaxy, and galaxy-shear correlation functions from the Dark Energy Survey, and distance moduli measurements from Type Ia Supernovae. The tightest bounds we find are $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.43$ eV and $m_a&lt;1.1$ eV, both at $95\%$ CL. Interestingly, these limits are still much stronger than those found on e.g. laboratory neutrino mass searches, reassessing the robustness of the extraction of thermal relic properties via cosmological observations. In addition, when considering lensing-only data, the significance of the Hubble constant tension is considerably reduced, while the clustering parameter $\sigma_8$ controversy is completely absent.</p>

<p>2023-07-26, <strong>Diraxiogenesis</strong>, Maximilian Berbig et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14121v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14121v1</a></p>

<p>The family of Dirac Seesaw models offers an intriguing alternative explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses without necessarily requiring microscopic lepton number violation, when compared to the more familiar class of Majorana Seesaws. A global $\text{U}(1)_\text{D}$ symmetry, that is explicitly broken by a higher dimensional scalar operator, ensures that the right handed neutrino does not couple directly to the Standard Model like Higgs and an exact gauged or residual lepton number symmetry prohibits all Majorana masses. We demonstrate that all three Dirac Seesaws possess a Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the $\text{U}(1)_\text{D}$ symmetry, that we call the Diraxion, whose cosmological dynamics have so far been left unexplored. Furthermore we illustrate that a Dirac-Leptogenesis version of the recently proposed Lepto-Axiogenesis scenario can be realized in this class of models, leading to a unified origin of the observed baryon asymmetry and dark matter relic abundance. Explaining only the baryon asymmetry can lead to potentially observable amounts of right handed neutrino dark radiation with $\Delta N_\text{eff.}\lesssim 0.028$. On the other hand, if we only fix the dark matter abundance via the kinetic misalignment mechanism, this set-up could lead to detectable signatures in proposed cosmic neutrino background experiments via decays of eV-scale Diraxions to neutrinos. Here there is no domain wall problem, since topological defects immediately decay to a subleading fraction of relic Diraxions. A key ingredient of all Axiogenesis scenarios is the dynamics of relatively light scalar called the Saxion, that in our case has a mass at the GeV-scale and which might reveal itself in heavy meson decays or collider searches. Our setup predicts isocurvature perturbations in baryons, dark matter and dark radiation sourced by fluctuations of the Saxion.</p>

<p>2023-07-26, <strong>Automatic test system for the data acquisition board of GRANDProto300</strong>, Yiren Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14102v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14102v1</a></p>

<p>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect the radio emission from air showers triggered by ultra-high-energy particles in the atmosphere. GRANDProto300 is its pathfinder array, of which the first 100 detection units have already been produced. A custom data acquisition (DAQ) board receives, processes, and transmits radio signals. We report on the board design, and on the functions and performance tests applied to it. Function tests are of signal acquisition and transmission, and of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) filter algorithm. Performance tests are of the analog-to-digital conversion and GPS time accuracy. We developed an efficient system to automate the test, in line with the mass-production scale needed to build future, larger versions of GRAND.</p>

<p>2023-07-26, <strong>Measurement of the $2νββ$ decay rate and spectral shape of $^{100}$Mo from the CUPID-Mo experiment</strong>, C. Augier et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14086v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14086v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) is a yet unobserved nuclear process which would demonstrate Lepton Number violation, a clear evidence of beyond Standard Model physics. The process two neutrino double beta decay ($2\nu\beta\beta)$ is allowed by the Standard Model and has been measured in numerous experiments. In this letter, we report a measurement of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay half-life of $^{100}$Mo to the ground state of $^{100}$Ru of $(7.07~\pm~0.02~\text{(stat.)}~\pm~0.11~\text{(syst.)})~\times~10^{18}$~yr by the CUPID-Mo experiment. With a relative precision of $\pm~1.6$ \% this is the most precise measurement to date of a $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay rate in $^{100}$Mo. In addition, we constrain higher-order corrections to the spectral shape which provides complementary nuclear structure information. We report a novel measurement of the shape factor $\xi_{3,1}=0.45~\pm 0.03~\text{(stat.)} \ \pm 0.05 \ \text{(syst.)}$, which is compared to theoretical predictions for different nuclear models. We also extract the first value for the effective axial vector coupling constant obtained from a spectral shape study of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay.</p>

<p>Sources of astrophysical neutrinos can potentially be discovered through the detection of neutrinos in coincidence with electromagnetic counterparts. Real-time alerts generated by IceCube play an important role in this search, acting as triggers for follow-up observations with instruments sensitive to electromagnetic signals in various wavelengths. In previous studies, we investigated the treatment of the systematic uncertainties on the reconstruction method currently used in IceCube’s real-time program, concluding that a new approach, more robust against systematic variations, is needed. Here we present the state-of-the-art of these analyses, and discuss a modification to an already-existing and reliable reconstruction method that results in an improved solution under many metrics. The proposed reconstruction method is faster, more precise, and significantly less influenced by systematic uncertainties, than the current one. This system provides a more robust estimate of angular uncertainties than the previous algorithm, making it a solid benchmark for real-time event analyses.</p>

<p>2023-07-26, <strong>Intergenerational gauged $B-L$ model and its implication to muon $g-2$ anomaly and thermal dark matter</strong>, Nobuchika Okada et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14053v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14053v1</a></p>

<p>We study the flavor dependent $U(1)_{B_i-L_j}$ models, where an $i$-th generation of quarks and $j(\neq i)$-th generation of leptons are charged. By solving the anomaly free condition for the matter sector of the SM fermions and three generations of RH neutrinos, we find that the $j$-th generation of RH neutrino is not necessarily charged under the $U(1)_{B_i-L_j}$ gauge symmetry with the charge $-1$ and the other (neither $i$-th nor $j$-th) generation of RH neutrino can also be. As a general solution for the anomaly cancellation conditions, the other two RN neutrinos than the charge $-1$ RH neutrino may have non-vanishing charge and be stable due to the gauge invariance, and hence it is a candidate for dark matter (DM) in our Universe. We apply this result to a $B_3-L_2$ model and consider a light thermal DM and a solution to the muon $g-2$ anomaly. We identify the parameter region to have the DM mass range from MeV to sub-GeV and simultaneously solve the muon $g-2$ anomaly. We also derive the constraints on the gauge kinetic mixing parameter by using the latest Borexino Phase-II data.</p>

<p>The IceCube-Gen2 facility will extend the energy range of IceCube to ultra-high energies. The key component to detect neutrinos with energies above 10 PeV is a large array of in-ice radio detectors. In previous work, direction reconstruction algorithms using the forward-folding technique have been developed for both shallow ($\lesssim 20$ m) and deep in-ice detectors, and have also been successfully used to reconstruct cosmic rays with ARIANNA. Here, we focus on the reconstruction algorithm for the deep in-ice detector, which was recently introduced in the context of the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G). We discuss the performance-critical aspects of the algorithm, as well as recent and future improvements, and apply it to study the performance of a station of the IceCube-Gen2 in-ice radio array. We obtain the angular resolution, which turns out to be strongly asymmetric, and use this to optimize the configuration of a single station.</p>

<p>IceAct is an array of compact Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes at the ice surface as part of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The telescopes, featuring a camera of 61 silicon photomultipliers and fresnel-lens-based optics, are optimized to be operated in harsh environmental conditions, such as at the South Pole. Since 2019, the first two telescopes have been operating in a stereoscopic configuration in the center of IceCube’s surface detector IceTop. With an energy threshold of about 10 TeV and a wide field-of-view, the IceAct telescopes show promising capabilities of improving current cosmic-ray composition studies: measuring the Cherenkov light emissions in the atmosphere adds new information about the shower development not accessible with the current detectors. First simulations indicate that the added information of a single telescope leads, e.g., to an improved discrimination between flux contributions from different primary particle species in the sensitive energy range. We review the performance and detector operations of the telescopes during the past 3 years (2020-2022) and give an outlook on the future of IceAct.</p>

<p>We investigate the impact of new light particles, carrying significant energy in the early universe after neutrino decoupling, on the cosmological effective relativistic neutrino species, $N_$. If the light particles are produced from decoupled neutrinos, $N_$ is predominantly modified through the dilution-resistant effect. This effect arises because the energy stored in the mass of new particles is less diluted than the photon and neutrino energy as the universe expands. Our study comprehensively explores this effect, deriving $N_$ constraints on the couplings of light mediators with neutrinos, encompassing both scalar and vector mediators. We find that the dilution-resistant effect can increase $N_$ by 0.118 and 0.242 for scalar and vector mediators, respectively. These values can be readily reached by forthcoming CMB experiments. Upon reaching these levels, future $N_$ constraints on the couplings will be improved by many orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is equipped with the unique possibility to measure cosmic ray induced air showers simultaneously by their particle footprint on the surface with the IceTop detector and by the high-energy muonic shower component at a depth of more than 1.5 km. Since 2019 additionally two Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes, called IceAct, measure the electromagnetic component of air showers in the atmosphere above the IceCube detector. This opens the possibility to measure air shower parameters in three independent detectors and allows to improve mass composition studies with the IceCube data. One IceAct camera consists of 61 SiPM pixels in a hexagonal grid. Each pixel has a field of view of 1.5 degree resulting in an approximately 12-degree field of view per camera. A single telescope tube has a diameter of 50 cm, is built robust enough to withstand the harsh Antarctic conditions, and is able to detect cosmic ray particles with energies above approximately 10 TeV. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is trained to determine the air shower properties from IceAct data. The composition analysis is then performed using Random Forest Regression (RF). Since all three detectors have a different energy threshold, we train several RFs with different inputs, combining the different detectors and taking advantage of the lower energy threshold of the IceAct telescopes. This will result in composition measurements for different detector combinations and enables cross-checks of the results in overlapping energy bands. We present the method, parameters for data selection, and the status of this analysis.</p>

<p>A precise understanding of the optical properties of the instrumented Antarctic ice sheet is crucial to the performance of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov array of 5,160 digital optical modules (DOMs) deployed in the deep ice below the geographic South Pole. We present an update to the description of the ice tilt, which describes the undulation of layers of constant optical properties as a function of depth and transverse position in the detector. To date, tilt modeling has been based solely on stratigraphy measurements performed by a laser dust logger during the deployment of the array. We now show that it can independently be deduced using calibration data from LEDs located in the DOMs. The new fully volumetric tilt model not only confirms the magnitude of the tilt along the direction orthogonal to the ice flow obtained from prior dust logging, but also includes a newly discovered tilt component along the flow.</p>

<p>In this work, we revisit neutrino mixing sum rules arising from discrete symmetries, and the class of Littlest Seesaw neutrino models. These theoretical models offer predictions for the leptonic CP phase and mixing angles, and correlations among them, which can be tested in forthcoming neutrino experiments. In particular, we study the solar neutrino mixing sum rules, arising from charged lepton corrections to Tri-bimaximal (TB), Bi-maximal (BM), Golden Ratios (GRs), and Hexagonal (HEX) neutrino mixing, and atmospheric neutrino mixing sum rules, arising from preserving one of the columns of these types of mixing, for example, the first or second column of the TB mixing matrix (TM1 or TM2), and confront them with an up-to-date global fit of the neutrino oscillation data. We show that some mixing sum rules, for example, an atmospheric neutrino mixing sum rule arising from a version of neutrino Golden Ratio mixing (GRa1), are already excluded at $3\sigma$, and determine the remaining models allowed by the data. We also consider the highly predictive Littlest Seesaw models, which are a special case of tri-maximal mixing models (TM1), and discuss their prospects</p>

<p>The initial evidence of astrophysical neutrinos by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory stemmed from the high-energy starting events (HESE) sample: a selection of the highest-energy neutrino interactions that occurred within the detector fiducial volume. Each event was reconstructed based on our best knowledge of the ice at the time, with the latest results published in a description of the sample using 7.5 years of data. Since then, several major improvements in ice modeling have occurred using in-situ calibration data. These include a microscopic description of ice anisotropy arising from ice crystal birefringence and a more complete mapping of the ice layer undulations across the detector. The improvements feed into more accurate descriptions of individual events, and can especially affect the directional reconstruction of particle showers. Here, we apply the latest ice model in an exact manner to reconstruct IceCube’s high-energy events using DirectFit. This reconstruction samples posterior distributions across parameters of interest by performing full event resimulation and photon propagation at each step. We obtain improved per-event descriptions, as well as updates on previously published source searches using the aggregated sample.</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>Role of QCD in moduli stabilization during inflation and axion dark matter</strong>, Ryuichiro Kitano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15059v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.15059v1</a></p>

<p>Ignorance of the initial condition for the axion dynamics in the early Universe has led us to consider an $O(1)$ valued initial amplitude, and that prefers the decay constant, $F_a$, of the QCD axion to be an intermediate scale such as $10^{12}$ GeV in order to explain the dark matter abundance. We explore a cosmological scenario of $F_a$ being much larger than $10^{12}$ GeV by considering the axion and moduli dynamics during inflation to set the initial amplitude. We show that if the volume moduli (radion) of the extra-dimension is stabilized mainly by the QCD contribution to the moduli potential during inflation, the QCD axion with the string-scale decay constant obtains a mass around the inflationary Hubble parameter. This means that the axion rolls down to the $\theta = 0$ minimum during the inflation realizing almost vanishing initial amplitude, and the inflationary quantum fluctuation can be the dominant source of the current number density of axions. We find natural parameter regions where the axion explains the cold dark matter of the Universe, while the constraint on the isocurvature perturbation is avoided. The presence of the axion miniclusters or axion stars are predicted in a wide range of parameters, including the one explains the Subaru-HCS microlensing event.</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>Simulation-guided galaxy evolution inference: A case study with strong lensing galaxies</strong>, Andreas Filipp et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15044v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.15044v1</a></p>

<p>Understanding the evolution of galaxies provides crucial insights into a broad range of aspects in astrophysics, including structure formation and growth, the nature of dark energy and dark matter, baryonic physics, and more. It is, however, infeasible to track the evolutionary processes of individual galaxies in real time given their long timescales. As a result, galaxy evolution analyses have been mostly based on ensembles of galaxies that are supposed to be from the same population according to usually basic and crude observational criteria. We propose a new strategy of evaluating the evolution of an individual galaxy by identifying its descendant galaxies as guided by cosmological simulations. As a proof of concept, we examined the evolution of the total mass distribution of a target strong lensing galaxy at $z=0.884$ using the proposed strategy. We selected 158 galaxies from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation that we identified as analogs of the target galaxy. We followed their descendants and found 11 observed strong lensing galaxies that match in stellar mass and size with the descendants at their redshifts. The observed and simulated results are discussed, although no conclusive assessment is made given the low statistical significance due to the small sample size. Nevertheless, the test confirms that our proposed strategy is already feasible with existing data and simulations. We expect it to play an even more important role in studying galaxy evolution as more strong lens systems and larger simulations become available with the advent of next-generation survey programs and cosmological simulations.</p>

<p>Leading two-loop contributions to the di-photon decay of the Higgs boson are evaluated for the first time in the Inert Doublet Model (IDM). We employ for this calculation the Higgs low-energy theorem, meaning that we obtain corrections to the Higgs decay process by taking Higgs-field derivatives of the leading two-loop contributions to the photon self-energy. Specifically, we have included purely scalar corrections involving inert BSM Higgs bosons, as well as external-leg contributions involving both the inert scalars and fermions. Our calculation has been performed with a full on-shell renormalization, and in the gauge-less limit. We investigate our results numerically in two scenarios of the IDM: one with a light dark matter (DM) candidate (Higgs resonance scenario), and another with all additional scalars heavy (heavy Higgs scenario). In both cases, we find that the inclusion of two-loop corrections qualitatively modifies the behavior of the decay width, compared with the one-loop ($i.e.$ leading) order, and that they increase the deviation from the Standard Model. These large deviations can be tested at the High-Luminosity LHC.</p>

<p>The axion-gluon coupling is the defining feature of the QCD axion. This feature induces additional and qualitatively different interactions of the axion with standard model particles – quadratic couplings. Previously, hadronic quadratic couplings have been studied and experimental implications have been explored especially in the context of atomic spectroscopy and interferometry. We investigate additional quadratic couplings to the electromagnetic field and electron mass. These electromagnetic quadratic couplings are generated at the loop level from threshold corrections and are expected to be present in the absence of fine-tuning. While they are generally loop-suppressed compared to the hadronic ones, they open up new ways to search for the QCD axion, for instance via optical atomic clocks. Moreover, due to the velocity spread of the dark matter field, the quadratic nature of the coupling leads to low-frequency fluctuations in any detector setup. These distinctive low-frequency fluctuations offer a way to search for heavier axions. We provide an analytic expression for the power spectral density of this low-frequency background and briefly discuss experimental strategies for a low-frequency background search.</p>

<p>We study the cross-correlation between maps of the unresolved $\gamma$-ray background constructed from the 12-year data release of the Fermi Large-Area Telescope, and the overdensity of galaxies in the redshift range $z\lesssim0.4$ as measured by the 2MASS Photometric Redshift survey and the WISE-SuperCOSMOS photometric survey. A signal is detected at the $8-9\sigma$ level, which we interpret in terms of both astrophysical $\gamma$-ray sources, and WIMP dark matter decay and annihilation. The sensitivity achieved allows us to characterise the energy and redshift dependence of the signal, and we show that the latter is incompatible with a pure dark matter origin. We thus use our measurement to place an upper bound on the WIMP decay rate and the annihilation cross-section, finding constraints that are competitive with those found in other analyses. Our analysis is based on the extraction of clean model-independent observables that can then be used to constrain arbitrary astrophysical and particle physics models. In this sense we produce measurements of the $\gamma$-ray emissivity as a function of redshift and rest-frame energy $\epsilon$, and of a quantity $F(\epsilon)$ encapsulating all WIMP parameters relevant for dark matter decay or annihilation. We make these measurements, together with a full account of their statistical uncertainties, publicly available.</p>

<p>We consider an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics with an additional $SU(2)$ gauge sector along with an additional scalar bidoublet and a non-linear sigma field. The neutral components of the bidoublet serve as dark matter candidates by virtue of the bidoublet being odd under a $Z_2$ symmetry. Generic beyond Standard Model constraints like vacuum stability, invisible decay of higgs, Higgs alignment limit and collider constraints on heavy gauge bosons restrict the parameter space of this model. In this multicomponent dark matter scenario, we investigate the interplay between the annihilation and co-annihilation channels originating from the new gauge sector as those contribute to the relic abundance. We also inspect the direct detection constraints on scattering cross-sections of the dark matter particles with the detector nucleons and present our observations.</p>

<p>We discuss the most sensitive constraints on Light Dark Matter (LDM) from accelerator experiments NA64 and BaBar and compare it with recent results from direct searches at XENON1T, DAMIC-M, SuperCDMS, and DarkSide-50. We show that for the dark photon ($A’$) model with scalar LDM, NA64 gives more stringent bounds for $A’$ masses $m_{A’} \leq 0.15~GeV$ than direct searches. Moreover, for the case of Majorana LDM the damping DM velocity $v$ factor, $v^2 \sim O(10^{-6})$, for the elastic LDM electron(nucleon) cross section makes direct observation of Majorana LDM extremely challenging, while the absence of this suppression in the NA64 case gives an advantage to the experiment. The similar situation takes place for pseudo-Dirac LDM. The BaBar provides the most stringent bounds for $A’$ masses $m_{A’} \geq 0.35~GeV$. For scalar LDM the direct detection experiments give more stringent bounds at $m_{A’} \geq 0.35~GeV$ while for Majorana and pseudo-Dirac LDM case, the BaBar bounds are more stringent. The complementarity of the two approaches in searching for LDM is underlined.</p>

<p>We investigate realistic models of compact objects, focusing on neutron and strange stars, composed by dense matter and dark energy in the form of a simple fluid or scalar field interacting with matter. For the dark energy component, we use equations of state compatible with cosmological observations. This requirement strongly constrains possible deviations from the simple $\Lambda$-Cold Dark-Matter model with EoS $p_{d}=-\rho_{d}$ at least for small densities of the dark component. But we can propose that the density of dark energy interacting with matter can reach large values in relativistic stars and affects the star parameters such as the mass and radius. Simple models of dark energy are considered. Then we investigated possible effects from modified gravity choosing to study the $R^2$ model combined with dark energy. Finally, the case of dark energy as scalar field non-minimally interacting with gravity is considered.</p>

<p>We reflect on the possibility of having a matter action that is invariant only under transverse diffeomorphisms. This possibility is particularly interesting for the dark sector, where no restrictions arise based on the weak equivalence principle. In order to implement this idea we consider a scalar field which couples to gravity minimally but via arbitrary functions of the metric determinant. We show that the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar field takes the perfect fluid form when its velocity vector is time-like. We analyze the conservation of this tensor in detail, obtaining a seminal novel result for the energy density of this field in the kinetic dominated regime. Indeed, in this regime the fluid is always adiabatic and we obtain an explicit expression for the speed of sound. Furthermore, to get insight in the gravitational properties of these theories, we consider the fulfillment of the energy conditions, concluding that nontrivial physically reasonable matter violates the strong energy condition in the potential domination regime. On the other hand, we present some shift-symmetric models of particular interest. These are: constant equation of state models (which may provide us with a successful description of dark matter or dark radiation) and models presenting different gravitational domains (characterized by the focusing or possible defocusing of time-like geodesics), as it happens in unified dark matter-energy models.</p>

<p>Dark Matter, if represented by a $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field, can manifest as both particles and condensates. In this paper, we study the evolution of an oscillating homogeneous condensate of a $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field in a thermal plasma in an FLRW universe. We focus on the perturbative regime where the oscillation amplitude is sufficiently small so that parametric resonance is inefficient. This perturbative regime necessarily comprises the late stage of the condensate decay and determines its fate. The coupled coarse-grained equations of motion for the condensate, radiation, and spacetime are derived from first principles using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. We obtain analytical expressions for the relevant microscopic quantities that enter the equations of motion and solve the latter numerically. We find that there is always a nonvanishing relic abundance for a $Z_2$-symmetric condensate because its decay rate decreases faster than the Hubble parameter at late times due to either the amplitude-dependence or the temperature-dependence in the condensate decay rate. Consequently, accounting for the condensate contribution to the overall Dark Matter relic density is essential for $Z_2$ scalar singlet Dark Matter. Unlike normal thermal freeze-out for particles, the condensate relic density depends on the initial condition which we take as arbitrary in the present work provided that it falls within the perturbative regime.</p>

<p>In this study, we investigate two dark energy models, MCJG and MCAG, in the context of $f(T)$ gravity within a non-flat FLRW Universe. Our analysis considers radiation, dark matter, and dark energy components. We compare the equation of state for MCJG and MCAG with $f(T)$ gravity. Using recent astronomical data (e.g., $H(z)$, type Ia supernovae, Gamma Ray Bursts, quasars, and BAO), we constrain the models’ parameters and explore the Universe’s behavior. The reduced Hubble parameter is expressed in terms of observable parameters like $\Omega_{r0}$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{k0}$, $\Omega_{CJ0}$, $\Omega_{CA0}$, and $H_0$. We investigate cosmic evolution using deceleration, $\mathrm{Om}$, and statefinder diagnostics. Information criteria are employed to assess model viability, comparing against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our objective is to deepen our understanding of dark energy, its relation to $f(T)$ gravity, and the mechanisms governing the accelerated expansion of the Universe.</p>

<p>White dwarfs and neutron stars are far-reaching and multi-faceted laboratories in the hunt for dark matter. We review detection prospects of wave-like, particulate, macroscopic and black hole dark matter that make use of several exceptional properties of compact stars, such as ultra-high densities, deep fermion degeneracies, low temperatures, nucleon superfluidity, strong magnetic fields, high rotational regularity, and significant gravitational wave emissivity. Foundational topics first made explicit in this document include the effect of the ``propellor phase” on neutron star baryonic accretion, and the contribution of Auger and Cooper pair breaking effects to neutron star heating by dark matter capture.</p>

<p>We study the properties of associations of dwarf galaxies and their dependence on the environment. Associations of dwarf galaxies are extended systems composed exclusively of dwarf galaxies, considering as dwarf galaxies those galaxies less massive than $M_{\star, \rm max} = 10^{9.0}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}\,h^{-1}$. We identify these particular systems using a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation coupled to a dark matter only simulation in the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. To classify the environment, we estimate eigenvalues from the tidal field of the dark matter particle distribution of the simulation. We find that the majority, two thirds, of associations are located in filaments ($ \sim 67$ per cent), followed by walls ($ \sim 26 $ per cent), while only a small fraction of them are in knots ($ \sim 6 $ per cent) and voids ($ \sim 1 $ per cent). Associations located in more dense environments present significantly higher velocity dispersion than those located in less dense environments, evidencing that the environment plays a fundamental role in their dynamical properties. However, this connection between velocity dispersion and the environment depends exclusively on whether the systems are gravitational bound or unbound, given that it disappears when we consider associations of dwarf galaxies that are gravitationally bound. Although less than a dozen observationally detected associations of dwarf galaxies are currently known, our results are predictions on the eve of forthcoming large surveys of galaxies, which will enable these very particular systems to be identified and studied.</p>

<p>The Universe has evolved from an initial diffuse, uniform gas to a complex structure that includes both voids and high-density galaxy clusters connected by gaseous filaments, known as the Cosmic Web, and traced by 3D surveys of galaxies. The filamentary structure contains a significant fraction of the baryonic matter and is predicted to be mostly in the form of a moderately high temperature plasma, the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium. Plasma at this temperature and ionization level emits mostly in soft X-rays. The filamentary structure, however, is hard to detect because the other sources contributing to the Diffuse X-ray Background are much brighter and, currently, there are very few reported detections of emission from the filaments. We report the first high-confidence level indirect detection of X-ray emission from the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium. Applying the Power Spectrum Analysis to XMM-Newton and eROSITA data, we separated its contribution from other sources modeled in previous studies. Our result is in good agreement with numerical simulations and fills a critical gap in the picture of the large-scale structure of the Universe, in which filamentary gas, galaxies and dark matter interact and co-evolve.</p>

<p>2023-07-26, <strong>Collective Excitations of Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates: Breathing Mode and Appearance of Anisotropy under Self-Gravity</strong>, Kenta Asakawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14018v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14018v1</a></p>

<p>We study the collective mode of self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) described by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equation. The self-gravitating BEC recently receives significant attention in cosmology and astrophysics as a candidate for dark matter. We investigate the breathing and anisotropic collective modes by numerically solving the GPP equation and using the variational method. The breathing mode shows that the period decreases with the total mass due to the density dependence of the self-gravitating BEC, which is quantitatively consistent with our analytical results. We also obtain an anisotropic collective mode, in which the quadrupole mode is coupled with the breathing mode. The period of the quadrupole mode has the same total mass dependence as that of the breathing mode. The characteristics of these periods are different from those of ordinary BECs trapped by an external potential. However, despite the difference in density dependence, their ratio is equal to that of the BEC trapped by an isotropic harmonic potential. Furthermore, a variational method extended to a spheroidal configuration shows that we extract only the quadrupole mode from the anisotropic collective mode.</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>The state of the dark energy equation of state circa 2023</strong>, Luis A. Escamilla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14802v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14802v1</a></p>

<p>We critically examine the state of current constraints on the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w$. Our study is partially motivated by the observation that, while broadly consistent with the cosmological constant value $w=-1$, several independent probes appear to point towards a slightly phantom EoS ($w \sim -1.03$). We pay attention to the apparent preference for phantom DE from Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data alone, whose origin we study in detail and attribute to a wide range of (physical and geometrical) effects. We deem the combination of Planck CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, and Cosmic Chronometers data to be particularly trustworthy, inferring from this final consensus dataset $w=-1.013^{+0.038}_{-0.043}$, in excellent agreement with the cosmological constant value. Overall, despite a few scattered hints, we find no compelling evidence forcing us away from the cosmological constant (yet).</p>

<p>2023-07-27, <strong>Constraints on the Parameters of Modified Chaplygin-Jacobi and Modified Chaplygin-Abel Gases in $f(T)$ Gravity Model</strong>, Himanshu Chaudhary et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14691v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.14691v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we investigate two dark energy models, MCJG and MCAG, in the context of $f(T)$ gravity within a non-flat FLRW Universe. Our analysis considers radiation, dark matter, and dark energy components. We compare the equation of state for MCJG and MCAG with $f(T)$ gravity. Using recent astronomical data (e.g., $H(z)$, type Ia supernovae, Gamma Ray Bursts, quasars, and BAO), we constrain the models’ parameters and explore the Universe’s behavior. The reduced Hubble parameter is expressed in terms of observable parameters like $\Omega_{r0}$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{k0}$, $\Omega_{CJ0}$, $\Omega_{CA0}$, and $H_0$. We investigate cosmic evolution using deceleration, $\mathrm{Om}$, and statefinder diagnostics. Information criteria are employed to assess model viability, comparing against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our objective is to deepen our understanding of dark energy, its relation to $f(T)$ gravity, and the mechanisms governing the accelerated expansion of the Universe.</p>
