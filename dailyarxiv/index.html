<p>2023-08-10, <strong>Correlating neutrino millicharge and muon $(g-2)$ in an abelian $L_μ-L_τ$ model</strong>, Ashutosh Kumar Alok et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05720v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05720v1</a></p>

<p>The inclusion of an additional $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is a common feature in many extensions of the Standard Model, revealing the intricate connections between particle physics and cosmology. The $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ model stands as a prominent member of this distinguished family, characterized by its anomaly-free nature and resilience in the face of collider constraints. This framework provides a unique vantage point for investigating both the intriguing mystery of the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly and the puzzling issue of the Hubble tension. However, due to the presence of kinetic mixing between the photon and $Z’$ in this model, the neutrinos have the potential to acquire minuscule electric charges, often referred to as millicharges ($q_{\nu}$) which is directly related to the strength of the new gauge couplings. A crucial question emerges: how does the model’s inclusion of millicharges, while adhering to the stringent constraints imposed by experimental observations, influence its inherent ability to address the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly and the Hubble tension? We find the current upper bounds on $q_{\nu}$ derived from experiments such as the beam dump, XENONnT and LUX-ZEPLIN experiments can impose strong constraints on the $U(1)_{L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$ coupling. Consequently, these constraints may limit the ability of the model to fully accommodate the current measurement of $(g-2)_{\mu}$ while having a relatively minor impact on the resolution of the Hubble tension.</p>

<p>2023-08-10, <strong>Semi-visible dark photon in a model with vector-like leptons for the $(g-2)_{e,μ}$ and $W$-boson mass anomalies</strong>, Waleed Abdallah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05691v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05691v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a model realizes that a semi-visible dark photon which can contribute to the anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$) of both electron and muon. In this model, the electron $g-2$ is deviated from the Standard Model (SM) prediction by the 1-loop diagrams involving the vector-like leptons, while that of muon is deviated due to a non-vanishing gauge kinetic mixing with photons. We also argue that the $W$-boson mass can be deviated from the SM prediction due to the vector-like lepton loops, so that the value obtained by the CDF II experiment can be explained. Thus, this model simultaneously explains the recent three anomalies in $g-2$ of electron and muon as well as the $W$-boson mass. The constraints on the $\mathcal{O}(1)~\mathrm{GeV}$ dark photon can be avoided because of the semi-invisible decay of the dark photon, $A^\prime \to 2 N \to 2\nu \,2\chi \to 2\nu \,4e$, where $N$ is a SM singlet vector-like neutrino and $\chi$ is a CP-even Higgs boson of the $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry.</p>

<p>2023-08-10, <strong>Reactor Antineutrino Spectral “Bump”: Cumulative Fission Yields of Irradiated U-235 and Pu-239 Measured by HPGe Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy</strong>, Samuel Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05630v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05630v1</a></p>

<p>Recent measurements of the reactor antineutrino emission show that there exists a spectral excess (the “bump”) in the 5-7 MeV region when compared to the Huber-Muller prediction based on the conversion method. Analysis within an alternate prediction technique, the summation method, suggests that the bump could be due to excess contributions from a certain few of the beta-decaying fission products. However, it has been shown that when updated fission yield values are used in the summation method, the predicted excess vanishes. In the present preliminary study, fission yields for nuclides suspected of causing the neutrino spectral bump are investigated using gamma-ray spectroscopy of U-235 and Pu-239 samples freshly irradiated using the High Flux Isotope Reactor. For several of the suspect nuclides, the derived fission yields are consistent with JEFF3.3 fission yield library. The exception is the case of Cs-140 from Pu-239, where the discrepancy between the fitted and expected values suggests a potential error in the fission yield library. This highlights the importance of using accurate nuclear data libraries in the analysis of the reactor antineutrino spectra, and the need for ongoing efforts to improve these libraries.</p>

<p>2023-08-10, <strong>Probing invisible dark photon models via atmospheric collisions</strong>, Mingxuan Du et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05607v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05607v1</a></p>

<p>Atmospheric collisions can copiously produce dark sector particles in the invisible dark photon model, leading to detectable signals in underground neutrino detectors. We consider the dark photon model with the mass mixing mechanism and use the Super-K detector to detect the electron recoil events caused by the atmospherically produced dark sector particles within the model. We find that the combined data from four Super-K runs yield new leading constraints for the invisible dark photon in the mass range of $\sim(0.5-1.4)$ GeV, surpassing the constraints from NA64, BaBar, and searches for millicharged particles.</p>

<p>2023-08-10, <strong>Neutrinos from interactions between the relativistic jet and large-scale structures of BL Lac objects investigated through their gamma-ray spectrum</strong>, Luca Foffano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05492v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05492v1</a></p>

<p>Absorption and emission lines in the optical spectrum are typically used to investigate the presence of large-scale environments in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). BL Lac objects - which are a category of AGNs with the relativistic jet pointing directly to the observer - are supposed to represent a late evolution stage of AGNs. Their large-scale structures are probably poorer of material, which is distributed with lower densities throughout the circumnuclear environment. Their accretion disk is weak and weakly reprocessed, making the non-thermal continuum of the relativistic jet dominate their optical spectrum and preventing us from identifying the thermal emission of the photon fields produced by such large-scale structures. However, these photon fields may still exist and eventually interact with the gamma rays traveling in the blazar jet via gamma-gamma pair production, producing observable effects such as absorption features in their spectral energy distribution. Interestingly, the same photon field might also lead to the production of high-energy neutrinos, acting as targets for proton-photon interactions. In this contribution, we present the results of a set of simulations over a wide parameter space describing both the blazar jet and the photon field properties. We discuss the most effective conditions that may produce fluxes of neutrinos compatible with the sensitivities of the current and the next generation of neutrino detectors. We will also discuss how the possible neutrino flux would be related to the properties of the large-scale structures investigated indirectly through the analysis of the gamma-ray spectrum of the BL Lac object.</p>

<p>2023-08-10, <strong>Refining the IceCube detector geometry using muon and LED calibration data</strong>, Matti Janson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05330v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05330v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory deployed 5160 digital optical modules (DOMs) on 86 cables, called strings, in a cubic kilometer of deep glacial ice below the geographic South Pole. These record the Cherenkov light of passing charged particles. Knowledge of the DOM positions is vital for event reconstruction. While vertical positions have been calibrated, previous in-situ geometry calibration methods have been unable to measure horizontal deviations from the surface positions, largely due to degeneracies with ice model uncertainties. Thus the lateral position of the surface position of each hole is to date in almost all cases used as the lateral position of all DOMs on a given string. With the recent advances in ice modeling, two new in-situ measurements have now been undertaken. Using a large sample of muon tracks, the individual positions of all DOMs on a small number of strings around the center of the detector have been fitted.   Verifying the results against LED calibration data shows that the string-average corrections improve detector modeling. Directly fitting string-average geometry corrections for the full array using LED data agrees with the average corrections as derived from muons where available. Analyses are now ongoing to obtain per-DOM positions using both methods and in addition, methods are being developed to correct the recorded arrival times for the expected scattering delay, allowing for multilateration of the positions using nanosecond-precision propagation delays.</p>

<p>2023-08-10, <strong>$(g-2)_μ$ and Stau coannihilation : Dark Matter and Collider Analysis</strong>, Manimala Chakraborti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05723v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05723v1</a></p>

<p>Slepton coannihilation is one of the most promising scenarios that can bring the predicted Dark Matter (DM) abundance in the the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) into agreement with the experimental observation. In this scenario, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), usually assumed to be the lightest neutralino, can serve as a Dark Matter (DM) candidate while the sleptons as the next-to-LSPs (NLSPs) lie close in mass. In our previous studies analyzing the electroweak (EW) sector of MSSM, a degeneracy between the three generations of sleptons was assumed for the sake of simplicity. In case of slepton coannihilation this directly links the smuons involved in the explanation for $(g-2)_\mu$ to the coannihilating NLSPs required to explain the DM content of the universe. On the other hand, in Grand Unified Theories such degeneracy do not hold, and often the lighter stau turns out to be the NLSP at the EW scale, with the smuons (and selectrons) somewhat heavier. In this paper we analyze a non-universal slepton mass scenario at the EW scale where the first two generations of sleptons are taken to be mass-degenerate and heavier than the staus, enforcing stau coannihilation. We analyze the parameter space of the MSSM in the light of a variety of experimental data namely, the DM relic density and direct detection (DD) limits, LHC data and especially, the discrepancy between the experimental result for $(g-2)_\mu$, and its Standard Model (SM) prediction. We find an upper limit on the LSP and NLSP masses of about ~ 550 GeV. In contrast to the scenario with full degeneracy among the three families of sleptons, the upper limit on the light smuon/selectron mass moves up by ~ 200 GeV. We analyze the DD prospects as well as the physics potential of the HL-LHC and a future high-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider to investigate this scenario further.</p>

<p>2023-08-10, <strong>Dark Matter Phenomenology in 2HDMS in light of the 95 GeV excess</strong>, Juhi Dutta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05653v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05653v1</a></p>

<p>The Two Higgs Doublet model extended with a complex scalar singlet (2HDMS) is a well-motivated Beyond Standard Model candidate addressing several open problems of nature. In this work, we focus on the dark matter (DM) phenomenology of the complex scalar singlet where the real part of the complex scalar obtains a vacuum expectation value. The model is characterized by an enlarged Higgs spectrum comprising six physical Higgs bosons and a pseudoscalar DM candidate. We address the impact of accommodating the 95 GeV excess on the 2HDMS parameter space and DM observables after including all theoretical and experimental constraints. Finally, we look into the prospects of this scenario at HL-LHC and future lepton colliders for a representative benchmark.</p>

<p>2023-08-10, <strong>An extraordinarily massive galaxy that formed its stars at $z \gtrsim 11$</strong>, Karl Glazebrook et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05606v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05606v1</a></p>

<p>The formation of galaxies by gradual hierarchical co-assembly of baryons and cold dark matter halos is a fundamental paradigm underpinning modern astrophysics. A key test of this paradigm is via the observations of massive galaxies at early times as the evolution of the masses and abundances of dark matter halos is straight forward to simulate and massive halos should contain the universal cosmic baryon fraction at high redshift. Extremely massive quiescent galaxies &gt; $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ have now been observed as early as 1-2 billions years after the Big Bang producing tension with theoretical models and driving significant revisions. Typical spectroscopic ages of these objects are 300-500 Myr. Here we report on the spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope of one of these objects that is quite different from the rest; selected by it having much redder colours. We see spectral features typical of much older stellar populations and detailed modeling shows that they formed at least 1.5 billion years earlier in time $z \gtrsim 11$ in a rapid star formation event. Dark matter halos massive enough to host these ancestors ought not to have assembled at this time. This observation may point to a significant gap in our understanding of early stellar populations, galaxy formation and/or the nature of dark matter.</p>

<p>2023-08-10, <strong>Vacuum Branching, Dark Energy, Dark Matter</strong>, Don Weingarten et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05569v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05569v1</a></p>

<p>Beginning with the Everett-DeWitt many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, there have been a series of proposals for how the state vector of a quantum system might split at any instant into orthogonal branches, each of which exhibits approximately classical behavior. In an earlier version of the present work, we proposed a decomposition of a state vector into branches by finding the minimum of a measure of the mean squared quantum complexity of the branches in the branch decomposition. Here we define a formulation of quantum complexity for quantum electrodynamics on a lattice in Minkowski space. With respect to a particular Lorentz frame, for a system beginning in a state of low complexity, branching occurs repeatedly over time with each branch splitting successively into further sub-branches among which the branch followed by the real world is chosen according to the Born rule. Alternatively, in an explicitly Lorentz covariant formulation, the real world is a single random draw from the set of branches at asymptotically late time, which can then be restored to finite time in a particular Lorentz frame by sequentially retracing the set of branching events implied by the late time choice. The earlier version here is simplified by replacing a definition of complexity based on the physical vacuum with a definition based on the bare vacuum. As a consequence of this replacement, the physical vacuum itself is predicted to branch yielding branches with energy densities slightly larger than that of the unbranched vacuum. If the vacuum energy renormalization constant is chosen as usual to give 0 energy density to the unbranched vacuum, vacuum branches will appear to have a combination of dark energy and dark matter densities but no additional particle content.</p>

<p>2023-08-10, <strong>Black hole surrounded by the pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo</strong>, Yi Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05544v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05544v1</a></p>

<p>The abundance of dark matter in the actual universe motivates us to construct the black hole spacetime enveloped by dark matter. In this paper, we present a new spherically symmetric black hole surrounded by the pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo, and then explore the effects of the pseudo-isothermal halo profile on a rotating black hole at the M87 galactic center, aiming to achieve a black hole solution that aligns with those found in the real universe. Using the Newman-Janis method, we derive a rotating black hole solution encompassed by the pseudo-isothermal halo, which is consistent with observations of actual black holes that are believed to possess spin. Our investigation focuses on the impact of the pseudo-isothermal halo on the black hole event horizon, time-like and null orbits, as well as the black hole shadow. We find that as the spin parameter $a$ increases, the interval between the inner event horizon and the outer event horizon of the rotating black hole surrounded by the pseudo-isothermal halo in M87 diminishes. This leads to the formation of an extreme black hole. The presence of dark matter, however, has minimal effect on the event horizon. Moreover, in the M87 as the spin parameter $a$ increases, the black hole shadow deviates increasingly from a standard circle, with larger spin parameters causing more pronounced distortion relative to the standard circle. Surprisingly, we observe that the dark matter density has very little influence on the shadow of the black hole surrounded by the pseudo-isothermal halo in the M87. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of black hole structures and the role of dark matter in the universe.</p>

<p>2023-08-10, <strong>Electron $g-2$ corrections from axion dark matter</strong>, Ariel Arza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05375v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.05375v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the effects of a local axion dark matter background on the $g-2$ of the electron. We calculate loop corrections to the photon-electron vertex and determine analytical formulas for the spin and cyclotron frequencies when the electron is in an external magnetic field. By comparing with current measurements of these observables, we are able to place the strongest constraint on the axion-elecron coupling for axion masses below $10^{-15}\text{eV}$.</p>
