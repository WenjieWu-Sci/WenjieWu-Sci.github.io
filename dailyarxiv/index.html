<p>2023-06-26, <strong>Neutrino magnetic moment and XENON1T excess, inert doublet dark matter in a Type-III radiative scenario</strong>, Shivaramakrishna Singirala et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14801v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14801v1</a></p>

<p>We narrate dark matter, neutrino magnetic moment and mass in a Type-III radiative scenario. The Standard Model is enriched with three vector-like fermion triplets and two inert doublets to provide a suitable platform for the above phenomenological aspects. The inert scalars contribute to total relic density of dark matter in the Universe. Neutrino aspects are realized at one-loop with magnetic moment obtained through charged scalars, while neutrino mass gets contribution from charged and neutral scalars. Taking inert scalars up to $2$ TeV and triplet fermion in few hundred TeV range, we obtain a common parameter space, compatible with experimental limits associated with both neutrino and dark matter sectors. Using a specific region for transition magnetic moment (${\cal O} (10^{-11}\mu_B$)), we explain the excess recoil events, reported by the XENON1T collaboration.</p>

<p>2023-06-26, <strong>Constraints on quantum spacetime-induced decoherence from neutrino oscillations</strong>, Vittorio D’Esposito et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14778v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14778v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the implications of decoherence induced by quantum spacetime properties on neutrino oscillation phenomena. We develop a general formalism where the evolution of neutrinos is governed by a Lindblad-type equation and we compute the oscillation damping factor for various models that have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity to these effects of different types of neutrino oscillation experiments, encompassing astrophysical, atmospheric, solar, and reactor neutrino experiments. By using neutrino oscillation data from long-baseline reactors and atmospheric neutrino observations, we establish stringent constraints on the energy scale governing the strength of the decoherence induced by stochastic metric fluctuations, amounting to, respectively, $E_{QG}\geq 4.1 \cdot 10^{24}\; \text{GeV}$ and $E_{QG}\geq 4.2\cdot 10^{34}\;\text{GeV}$.</p>

<p>2023-06-26, <strong>Low and High Energy Neutrinos from SN 2023ixf in M101</strong>, Dafne Guetta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14717v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14717v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101 is the closest SN explosion observed in the last decade. Therefore it is a suitable test bed to study the role of jets in powering the SN ejecta. With this aim, we explored the idea that high-energy neutrinos could be produced during the interaction between the jets and the intense radiation field produced in the SN explosion and eventually be observed by the IceCube neutrino telescope. The lack of detection of such neutrinos has significantly constrained both the fraction of stellar collapses that produce jets and/or the theoretical models for neutrino production. Finally, we investigated the possibility of detecting low-energy neutrinos from SN 2023ixf with the Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande experiments, obtaining in both cases sub-threshold estimates.</p>

<p>2023-06-26, <strong>Recasting Bounds on Long-lived Heavy Neutral Leptons in Terms of a Light Supersymmetric R-parity Violating Neutralino</strong>, Herbi K. Dreiner et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14700v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14700v1</a></p>

<p>In R-parity-violating (RPV) supersymmetric models, light neutralinos with masses from the GeV-scale down to even zero are still allowed by all laboratory constraints. They are further consistent with dark matter observations, as they decay via RPV couplings. These RPV couplings are in general constrained to be small. Hence, such light neutralinos, if produced, e.g., at a beam-dump or collider experiment, appear as displaced vertices or missing energy at the detector level. The same signatures have been extensively searched for at various experiments in the theoretical context of sterile neutrinos which mix with active neutrinos. In this work, we recast the sensitivity of both past and present experiments to sterile neutrinos to obtain new bounds on RPV couplings associated with a light neutralino. We find experiments such as T2K, BEBC, FASER, DUNE, and MoEDAL-MAPP can improve the current bounds on RPV couplings by up to $3-4$ orders of magnitude in several benchmark scenarios.</p>

<p>2023-06-26, <strong>Neutrino oscillation bounds on quantum decoherence</strong>, Valentina De Romeri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14699v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14699v1</a></p>

<p>We consider quantum-decoherence effects in neutrino oscillation data. Working in the open quantum system framework we adopt a phenomenological approach that allows to parameterize the energy dependence of the decoherence effects. We consider several phenomenological models. We analyze data from the reactor experiments RENO, Daya Bay and KamLAND and from the accelerator experiments NOvA, MINOS/MINOS+ and T2K. We obtain updated constraints on the decoherence parameters quantifying the strength of damping effects, which can be as low as $\Gamma_{ij} \lesssim 8 \times 10^{-27}$ GeV at 90% confidence level in some cases. We also present sensitivities for the future facilities DUNE and JUNO.</p>

<p>2023-06-26, <strong>Measurement of the 2$νββ$ Decay Half-Life of Se-82 with the Global CUPID-0 Background Model</strong>, O. Azzolini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14654v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14654v1</a></p>

<p>We report on the results obtained with the global CUPID-0 background model, which combines the data collected in the two measurement campaigns for a total exposure of 16.6 kg$\times$yr. We identify with improved precision the background sources in the region of interest for neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay, making more solid the foundations for the background budget of the next-generation CUPID experiment. Relying on the excellent data reconstruction, we measure the two-neutrino double $\beta$-decay half-life of $^{82}$Se with unprecedented accuracy: $T_{1/2}^{2\nu} = [8.69 \pm 0.05 \textrm{(stat.)}~^{+0.09}_{-0.06} \textrm{(syst.)}] \times 10^{19}~\textrm{yr}$.</p>

<p>2023-06-26, <strong>Hill-top inflation from Dai-Freed anomaly in the standard model – A solution to the iso-curvature problem of the axion dark matter</strong>, Masahiro Kawasaki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14579v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14579v1</a></p>

<p>The discrete symmetry $Z_4$ in the standard model (SM) with three right-handed neutrinos is free from the Dai-Freed anomaly. Motivated by this $Z_4$ symmetry, we constructed a topological inflation model consistent with all known constraints and observations. However, we assumed a specific inflaton potential in the previous work. In this paper we extend the inflaton potential in a more general form allowed by the discrete $Z_4$ gauge symmetry and show that consistent hilltop inflation is realized. We find that the Hubble parameter $H_\mathrm{inf}$ can be smaller than $\simeq 10^{9}$ GeV so that the isocurvature fluctuations of the axion dark matter are sufficiently suppressed. Furthermore, the running of the spectral index can be as large as $dn_s/\ln k \simeq 0.0018$ which will be tested in future CMB observations. Since this discrete $Z_4$ acts on the SM, the inflaton can couple to pairs of the right-handed neutrinos and hence the reheating temperature can be high as $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV, producing the cosmic baryon asymmetry naturally through the thermal leptogenesis.</p>

<p>2023-06-26, <strong>Simple Modular invariant model for Quark, Lepton, and flavored-QCD axion</strong>, Y. H. Ahn et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14467v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14467v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model by incorporating sterile neutrinos and a QCD axion to account for the mass and mixing hierarchies of quarks and leptons and to solve the strong CP problem, and by introducing $G_{\rm SM}\times \Gamma_N\times U(1)_X$ symmetry. We demonstrate that the K{"a}hler transformation corrects the weight of modular forms in the superpotential and show that the model is consistent with the modular and $U(1)_X$ anomaly-free conditions. This enables a simple construction of a modular-independent superpotential for scalar potential. Using minimal supermultiplets, we demonstrate a level 3 modular form-induced superpotential. Sterile neutrinos explain small active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and provide a well-motivated $U(1)_X$ breaking scale, whereas gauge singlet scalar fields play crucial roles in generating the QCD axion, heavy neutrino mass, and fermion mass hierarchy. The model predicts a range for the $U(1)_X$ breaking scale from $10^{13}$ GeV to $10^{15}$ GeV for $1\,\mbox{TeV}&lt; m_{3/2}&lt;10^6\,\mbox{TeV}$. In the supersymmetric limit, all Yukawa coefficients in the superpotential are given by complex numbers with an absolute value of unity, implying a democratic distribution. Performing numerical analysis, we study how model parameters are constrained by current experimental results. In particular, the model predicts that the value of the quark Dirac CP phase falls between $38^\circ$ to $87^\circ$, which is consistent with experimental data, and the favored value of the neutrino Dirac CP phase is around $250^\circ$. Furthermore, the model can be tested by ongoing and future experiments on axion searches, neutrino oscillations, and $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay.</p>

<p>2023-06-26, <strong>General solutions for TM$_{1,2}$ mixing in the minimal type-I seesaw mechanism and phenomenological constraints to Yukawa matrix of neutrinos</strong>, Masaki J. S. Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14383v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14383v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we concisely represent the general solution for the TM$_{1,2}$ mixing in the type-I minimal seesaw mechanism and show phenomenological constraints of the Yukawa matrix of neutrinos $Y$. First, conditions of $Z_{2}$ symmetry associated with TM$_{1,2}$ restrict two complex parameters. In addition, three complex parameters are constrained from five phenomenological parameters (two neutrino masses $m_{i}$, the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, the Dirac phase $\delta$, and the Majorana phase $\alpha$) and the overall phase. As a result, there is only one free complex parameter for $Y$, except for the right-handed neutrino masses $M_{1,2}$.   For the TM$_{1}$ mixing with normal hierarchy, the symmetry condition is imposed only on $Y$, and the physical parameters depend on $M_{R}$. In other situations, the dimensionless parameters $(\theta_{13}, \delta$ and $\alpha)$ do not depend on $M_{R}$ but only on certain combinations of the components of $Y$.</p>

<p>2023-06-25, <strong>Sterile Neutrino Portal Dark Matter with $Z_3$ Symmetry</strong>, An Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14091v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14091v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we consider the sterile neutrino portal dark matter with $Z_3$ symmetry. This model further extends the canonical type-I seesaw with a fermion singlet $\chi$ and a scalar singlet $\phi$. Under the $Z_3$ symmetry, the dark sector transforms as $\chi\to e^{i2\pi/3}\chi, \phi\to e^{i2\pi/3}\phi$, while the standard model particles and the sterile neutrino $N$ transform trivially. Besides the interactions as $y_{N} \phi \bar{\chi}N$ and $\lambda_{H\phi} (H^\dag H) (\phi^\dag \phi)$ allowed in the $Z_2$ symmetry, the $Z_3$ symmetry also introduces two new terms, i.e., $y_\chi \phi \overline{\chi^{c}} \chi$ and $\mu\phi^3/2$. These new interactions induce additional semi-annihilation processes as $\chi\chi\to N\chi$ and $\phi\phi\to h\phi$ for WIMP dark matter. We then perform a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenology of this $Z_3$ symmetric model. Viable parameter space is explored under the constraints from dark matter relic density, Higgs invisible decay, indirect and direct detection for both fermion and scalar dark matter. We find that the semi-annihilation channels $\chi\chi\to N\chi$ and $\phi\phi\to N\chi$ can lead to quite different phenomena from the $Z_2$ symmetric model, which provides a viable pathway to distinguish these two kinds of model.</p>

<p>2023-06-26, <strong>The temporal evolution of gas accretion onto the discs of simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies</strong>, F. G. Iza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14760v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14760v1</a></p>

<p>In the standard model of structure formation, galaxies form in the centre of dark matter haloes that develop as a result of inhomogeneities in the primordial mass distribution of the Universe. Afterwards, galaxies grow by means of continuous accretion of gaseous material stemming from the intergalactic medium, both in diffuse form and through collisions with other systems. After an initial period of violent growth, the gas settles into a rotationally-supported structure where stars are born, giving birth to the stellar disc. The accretion of gaseous material onto the disc plays a fundamental role in its evolution as it can change its dynamical and morphological properties, generating gas flows within the disc. In this work, we use 30 galaxies from the Auriga Project, a set of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of disc galaxies, to study the temporal dependence of the gas accretion rates, focusing on the inflowing and outflowing fluxes.</p>

<p>2023-06-26, <strong>A Way of Determination of Axion Mass with Quantum Hall Effect</strong>, Aiichi Iwazaki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14475v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14475v1</a></p>

<p>Axion dark matter is converted to electromagnetic radiations in the presence of strong magnetic field. The radiations possibly give rise to non trivial phenomena in condensed matter physics. Especially, we discuss that saturation of plateau-plateau transition width observed at low temperature in integer quantum Hall effect is caused by the axion. The radiations from axions are inevitably present in the experiment. Although the radiations generated by axion is extremely weak, Hall conductivity jumps up to next plateau even if only a single electron occupies an extended state; a localized electron is transited to the extended state by absorbing the radiation. According to our analysis, previous experiment\cite{sat6} of the saturation in detail suggests that the axion mass is in the range $10^{-5}\mbox{eV}\sim 10^{-6}$eV. We propose a way of the determination of the axion mass by imposing microwaves on Hall bar and also a way of the confirmation that the axion really causes the saturation of the width.</p>

<p>2023-06-25, <strong>Interacting Supernova Remnants: a population model for the Cherenkov Telescope Array</strong>, Crestan Silvia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14359v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14359v1</a></p>

<p>The work presented in this thesis is focused on the interacting supernova remnants (iSNRs), a class of gamma-ray emitting SNR where the radiation arise from the interaction of the SNR with a massive molecular cloud. At the moment only 16 iSNR are known. Before this work, there was not any population study of these sources. Here is proposed a model for the Galactic population of iSNRs which can be used in order to predict the number of these systems in the Galaxy and how many of these will be detectable by the next generation of {\gamma}-ray instruments. iSNRs are of particular interest for the particle acceleration study because these objects have been proved to be sites of acceleration of protons up to high energies. Furthermore, high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission can pinpoint the presence of energetic leptons or ions and help to constraint the acceleration efficiency and maximum energy of accelerated particles The model presented her was only achievable through the creation of a complete catalog of {\gamma}-ray (both GeV and TeV) supernova remnants that for each supernova remnants gives collect the physical and spectral information available in litterature. Simulating and analyzing the synthetic population, it was found that the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be able to duplicate the number of detected interacting systems in its survey of the Galactic plane.</p>

<p>2023-06-25, <strong>Failed supernovae as a natural explanation for the binary black hole mass distribution</strong>, Paul Disberg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14332v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14332v1</a></p>

<p>The more gravitational wave sources are detected, the better the mass distribution of binary black holes (BBHs) becomes known. This stellar graveyard shows several features, including an apparent mass gap which makes the distribution bimodal. The observed chirp mass distribution, in turn, appears to be trimodal. We aim to investigate to which extend we can explain the observed mass distribution with stellar evolution, specifically with the hypothesis that the mass gap is caused by the difference between successful and failed supernovae (SNe). We pose a hypothetical remnant function, based on literature of stellar evolution simulations, which relates initial mass to remnant mass, includes a black hole island and produces a bimodal remnant distribution. Moreover, we look at observed type II SN rates in an attempt to detect the effect of failed SNe. Finally, using a simplified estimation of binary evolution, we determine the remnant distribution resulting from our remnant function and compare it to observation. We find that failed SNe lower type II SN rates by approximately 25%, but the inferred rate from SN surveys is not accurate enough to confirm this. Furthermore, our estimation based on the remnant function produces a mass distribution that matches the general shape of the observed distributions of individual as well as chirp masses. Based on our research, we conclude that the failed SNe mechanism and the presence of the black hole island are a natural hypothesis for explaining the individual BBH mass distribution and chirp mass distribution. However, for a more firm conclusion more detailed simulations are needed.</p>

<p>2023-06-25, <strong>Baryonic models of ultra-low-mass compact stars for the central compact object in HESS J1731-347</strong>, Jia Jie Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14185v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.14185v1</a></p>

<p>The recent attempt on mass and radius inference of the central compact object within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 suggests for this object an unusually low mass of $M = 0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}\,M_{\odot}$ and a small radius of $R = 10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$\,km. We explore the ways such a result can be accommodated within models of dense matter with heavy baryonic degrees of freedom which are constrained by the multi-messenger observations. We find that to do so using only purely nucleonic models, one needs to assume a rather small value of the slope of symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. Once heavy baryons are included higher values of the slope $L_{\rm sym}$ become acceptable at the cost of a slightly reduced maximum mass of static configuration. These two scenarios are distinguished by the particle composition and will undergo different cooling scenarios. In addition, we show that the universalities of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations for static configurations can be extended to very low masses without loss in their accuracy.</p>
