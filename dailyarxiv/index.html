<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Searching for Hidden Sector Particles at Neutrino Telescopes</strong>, Sagar Airen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05326v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.05326v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the possibility of directly detecting light, long-lived hidden sector particles at the IceCube neutrino telescope. Such particles frequently arise in non-minimal hidden sectors that couple to the Standard Model through portal operators. We consider two distinct scenarios. In the first scenario, which arises from a neutrino portal interaction, a hidden sector particle is produced inside the detector by the collision of an energetic neutrino with a nucleon, giving rise to a visible cascade. This new state then decays into a hidden sector daughter, which can naturally be long-lived. The eventual decay of the daughter particle back to Standard Model states gives rise to a second cascade inside the detector. This scenario therefore gives rise to a characteristic “double bang” signal arising from the two distinct cascades. In the second scenario, which arises from a hypercharge portal interaction, a hidden sector particle is produced outside the detector by the collision of an atmospheric muon with a nucleon. This new state promptly decays into a pair of hidden sector daughters that are long-lived. If both daughters decay into Standard Model states inside the detector, we again obtain a double-bang signal from the two distinct cascades. We explore the reach of IceCube for these two scenarios and show that it has the potential to significantly improve the sensitivity to hidden sector models in the mass range from about a GeV to about 20 GeV.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Closing in on singly charged scalars</strong>, Snehadri Das et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05258v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.05258v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate current experimental constraints and future search prospects for a hypothetical spin-zero particle that carries unit electric charge: a singly charged scalar (SCS). In addition to providing useful benchmarks for collider searches, SCS particles are also well-motivated ingredients in relatively minimal dark sectors. We focus on scenarios in which the SCS decays promptly at colliders to a lepton plus either a neutrino or an invisible dark-sector particle of negligible mass. A promptly decaying SCS can easily have appreciable branching ratios to more than one lepton flavor while remaining consistent with constraints on lepton flavor violation. This broadens the allowed range of SCS masses to extend well beyond those for right-handed selectrons, smuons, or staus. For particular benchmark SCS branching ratios, we find that SCS masses above ~185 GeV and in a lower-mass window ~80-125 GeV are still allowed at 95% confidence level. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations to explore the potential of a boosted-decision-tree-based analysis to probe the surviving SCS parameter space in future searches at the (HL-)LHC, finding a significant increase in sensitivity relative to cut-based analyses both in the lower-mass window and at higher SCS masses.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Probing new physics scenarios using high energy events at NOvA far detector</strong>, Chinmay Bera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04984v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04984v1</a></p>

<p>NuMI Off-axis $\nu_e$ Appearance (NOvA) experiment is an ongoing long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. The primary channels of interest are the $\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_e$ appearance, $\nu_\mu$, $\bar{\nu}_\mu$ disappearance channels analyzed in the energy window $1&lt; E_\nu &lt; 4$ GeV. However, NOvA far detector sees non-trivial high energy $\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_e$ events in the energy range $4 &lt; E_\nu &lt; 20$ GeV. These high energy events provide us with an opportunity to investigate the subleading new physics scenarios. In this context, we study the sensitivity of the NOvA experiment to constrain the non-standard interaction (NSI) parameters and environmental decoherence. We observe that by including high energy events (signal + background) the degeneracy around $\epsilon_{e\tau} \sim 1.6$ can be removed throughout the $\delta_{CP}$ and $\delta_{e\tau}$ range. Further, we examine the role of signal versus beam background events in removing this degeneracy. In addition, assuming environmental decoherence in nature we illustrate the uncertainty in the determination of $\theta_{23}$ considering events from $1&lt;E_\nu&lt;4$ GeV and $1&lt;E_\nu&lt;20$ GeV.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>CSST Cosmological Emulator III: Hybrid Lagrangian Bias Expansion Emulation of Galaxy Clustering</strong>, Shuren Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04671v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04671v1</a></p>

<p>Galaxy clustering is an important probe in the upcoming China Space Station Telescope (CSST) survey to understand the structure growth and reveal the nature of the dark sector. However, it is a long-term challenge to model this biased tracer and connect the observable to the underlying physics. In this work, we present a hybrid Lagrangian bias expansion emulator, combining the Lagrangian bias expansion and the accurate dynamical evolution from $N$-body simulation, to predict the power spectrum of the biased tracer in real space. We employ the Kun simulation suite to construct the emulator, emulating across the space of 8 cosmological parameters including dynamic dark energy $w_0$, $w_a$, and total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. The sample variance due to the finite simulation box is further reduced using the Zel’dovich variance control, and it enables the precise measurement of the Lagrangian basis spectra up to quadratic order. The emulation of basis spectra realizes 1% level accuracy, covering wavelength $ k \leq 1 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$ and redshift $0\leq z\leq 3$ up to quadratic order field. To validate the emulator, we perform the joint fitting of the halo auto power spectrum and the halo-matter cross power spectrum from 46 independent simulations. Depending on the choice of counterpart, the joint fitting is unbiased up to $k_{\rm max}\simeq 0.7\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$ with $1\sim 2$ percent accuracy, for all the redshift and halo mass samples. As one of the CSST cosmological emulator series, our emulator is expected to provide accurate theoretical predictions of the galaxy power spectrum for the upcoming CSST survey.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Probing Terrestrial Relic Neutrino Charge with Mach-Zehnder Interferometer</strong>, Chuan-Ren Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04621v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04621v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a novel method to probe the cosmic neutrino background (CNB) which has been shown to be accumulated on the surface of the earth. If such relic neutrino carries non-zero electric charge, Mach-Zehnder interferometer offers a suitable venue to unveil its interaction with photons. For neutrino mass equals to 0.05 eV, the sensitivity reach of our proposal could probe the fractional electric charge of the neutrino $\epsilon_{\nu}$ as low as $9.3 \times 10^{-11},\, 1.6 \times 10^{-16}$, and $2.9 \times 10^{-22}$ provided that the interferometer operates at standard quantum limit (SQL), the Heisenberg limit as well as super-Heisenberg limit, respectively.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Bounds and detection of MeV-scale dark matter annihilation to neutrinos</strong>, Shinya Kanemura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04568v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04568v1</a></p>

<p>Current and most upcoming neutrino detectors can only reach a dark matter annihilation cross section to neutrinos larger than the standard freeze-out value, but they open intriguing detection avenues for non-standard dark matter paradigms. An important corollary of such non-standard scenarios is relic dark matter annihilation after neutrino decoupling, an effect that does not modify the neutrino temperature and was neglected in constraining the standard MeV-scale dark matter masses. By combining the contributions from entropy injection during neutrino decoupling and nonthermal neutrino energy release after decoupling, we derive significant constraints on the annihilation cross section to neutrinos, which in some mass regimes turn out to be stronger than the current bounds. Furthermore, we find that the lower bounds on dark matter masses become inconclusive under the recent data releases from the DESI, SPT-3G, and ACT collaborations. These bounds determine the extent to which upcoming neutrino detectors will probe dark matter annihilation into neutrinos.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>2024 TASI Lectures: A Dark Matter Primer</strong>, Tien-Tien Yu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05234v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.05234v1</a></p>

<p>These notes are based on a sequence of 4 lectures delivered at the 2024 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute (TASI) and at the Universit`a degli Studi di Padova. They are intended for graduate students at the early stages of their study of dark matter with some prior exposure to cosmology and quantum field theory. The primary aim is to offer an accessible introduction to dark matter and to lay the groundwork for exploring its phenomenology. These lectures are not intended to serve as a comprehensive review. We begin by motivating the study of dark matter through a discussion of the empirical evidence and the constraints it places on dark matter properties. This is followed by an overview of several canonical mechanisms for the production of cosmological dark matter, and a concluding section that surveys current experimental and observational efforts to detect it with a focus on direct detection.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Bayesian network 3D event reconstruction in the Cygno optical TPC for dark matter direct detection</strong>, Fernando Domingues Amaro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04973v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04973v1</a></p>

<p>The CYGNO experiment is developing a high-resolution gaseous Time Projection Chamber with optical readout for directional dark matter searches. The detector uses a helium-tetrafluoromethane (He:CF$_4$ 60:40) gas mixture at atmospheric pressure and a triple Gas Electron Multiplier amplification stage, coupled with a scientific camera for high-resolution 2D imaging and fast photomultipliers for time-resolved scintillation light detection. This setup enables 3D event reconstruction: photomultipliers signals provide depth information, while the camera delivers high-precision transverse resolution. In this work, we present a Bayesian Network-based algorithm designed to reconstruct the events using only the photomultipliers signals, yielding a full 3D description of the particle trajectories. The algorithm models the light collection process probabilistically and estimates spatial and intensity parameters on the Gas Electron Multiplier plane, where light emission occurs. It is implemented within the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling for posterior inference. Validation using data from the CYGNO LIME prototype shows accurate reconstruction of localized and extended tracks. Results demonstrate that the Bayesian approach enables robust 3D description and, when combined with camera data, further improves the precision of track reconstruction. This methodology represents a significant step forward in directional dark matter detection, enhancing the identification of nuclear recoil tracks with high spatial resolution.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Can Gravitational Wave Data Shed Light on Dark Matter Particles ?</strong>, Parthasarathi Majumdar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04905v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04905v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitational wave (GW) data from observed binary black hole coalescences (BBHC), proven to validate the Hawking Area Theorem (HAT) for black hole horizons, has been demonstrated to unambiguously pick theoretically computed logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Formula, which have a {\it negative} coefficient, when combined with the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics. We propose a composite, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hybrid' approach to quantum gravity black hole entropy calculation, additively combining results from the non-peturbative, background-independent Loop Quantum Gravity method, with those from the perturbative (one loop), background-dependent semiclassical approach (often called </code>geometric’ entropy) based on Euclidean Quantum Gravity. Our goal is to examine under what conditions, {\it absolute} consistency with HAT-validating GW data analyses is guaranteed. As a consequence of this demand for absolute consistency, nontrivial, albeit indirect, constraints appear to emerge on the Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) part of the spectrum of perturbative elementary particle fluctuations in a classical black hole background. Some species of the constrained, yet-unobserved BSM particle spectrum are currently under active consideration in particle cosmology as candidates for dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Probing Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter $-$ A PTA-PPA Synergy</strong>, Ximeng Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04871v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04871v1</a></p>

<p>Ultralight axion-like dark matter (ALDM) is a leading candidate in the dark matter realm, characterized by its prominent wave properties on astronomical scales. Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and Pulsar Polarization Arrays (PPAs) aim to detect this dark matter through timing and polarization measurements, respectively, of pulsars. The PTA relies on gravitational effects, as the ALDM halo perturbs the spacetime metric within the Milky Way, while the PPA detects non-gravitational effects, namely cosmological birefringence induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with photons. These two methods complement each other, synergistically enhancing the pulsar array’s capability to identify the ALDM signals in the data. In this article, we provide a foundational development of this synergy. We begin by revisiting previously derived two-point correlation functions for both PTA and PPA, and expand our analysis to include correlations between timing and polarization signals. We then construct likelihood functions for PTA and combined PTA-PPA analyses within a Bayesian framework, aimed at detecting the characteristic correlations of ALDM signals. We emphasize the non-Gaussianity of the ALDM timing signals, which arises from their non-linear dependence on the field, in contrast to the Gaussian nature of its polarization signals. To address the complexities introduced, we approach this investigation in two ways: one involves a Gaussian approximation with proper justifications, while the other derives the formalism from the generic Gaussian characteristics of the ALDM field. We anticipate that these efforts will lead to further developments in PTA and PTA-PPA analysis methods.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Characterization of the Hamamatsu R12699-406-M4 Photomultiplier Tube in Cold Xenon Environments</strong>, M. Adrover et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04844v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04844v1</a></p>

<p>The Hamamatsu R12699-406-M2 is a $2\times2$ multi-anode 2-inch photomultiplier tube that offers a compact form factor, low intrinsic radioactivity, and high photocathode coverage. These characteristics make it a promising candidate for next-generation xenon-based direct detection dark matter experiments, such as XLZD and PandaX-xT. We present a detailed characterization of this photosensor operated in cold xenon environments, focusing on its single photoelectron response, dark count rate, light emission, and afterpulsing behavior. The device demonstrated a gain exceeding $2\cdot 10^6$ at the nominal voltage of -1.0 kV, along with a low dark count rate of $(0.4\pm0.2)\;\text{Hz/cm}^2$. Due to the compact design, afterpulses exhibited short delay times, resulting in some cases in an overlap with the light-induced signal. To evaluate its applicability in a realistic detector environment, two R12699-406-M2 units were deployed in a small-scale dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. The segmented $2\times2$ anode structure enabled lateral position reconstruction using a single photomultiplier tube, highlighting the potential of the sensor for effective event localization in future detectors.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Dark higher-form portals and duality</strong>, Cypris Plantier et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04795v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04795v1</a></p>

<p>Light scalar or vector particles are among the most studied dark matter candidates. Yet, those are always described as scalar or vector fields. In this paper, we explore instead the embedding of the scalar particle in an antisymmetric rank-three tensor field, and the dark photon into an antisymmetric rank-two tensor field (a so-called Kalb-Ramond field), and construct minimal bases of effective interactions with Standard Model fields. Then, keeping phenomenological applications as our main objective, a number of theoretical aspects are clarified, in particular related to the impact of existing dualities among the corresponding free theories, and concerning their Stueckelberg representations. Besides, for the rank-two field, we present for the first time its full propagator, accounting for the possible presence of a pseudoscalar mass term. Thanks to these results, and with their different kinematics, gauge-invariant limits, and Lorentz properties, we show that these higher-form fields provide genuine alternative frameworks, with different couplings and expected signatures at low-energy or at colliders.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>The Centre of Attention: a Powerful Radio Galaxy Pinpoints a NIR-Dark Protocluster at z~3.9</strong>, A. J. Hedge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04747v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04747v1</a></p>

<p>We report the discovery of a $z\sim3.9$ protocluster identified from Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array Band 3 spectral scans of a bright radio source selected from the GaLactic and Extra-galactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey. Extended CO(4-3) and <a href="1-0">CI</a> line emission was detected in GLEAM J005332$-$325630 confirming it to be a $z=3.879$ powerful radio galaxy with luminosity, $L_{500 MHz}=1.3\times10^{28}$ ${W Hz}^{-1}$. This source is part of a sample of candidate high redshift radio galaxies with bright radio fluxes, $S_{150MHz}&gt;0.1$ Jy, but host galaxies with $K_s({AB})\gtrsim23$ mag. The molecular gas associated with the radio galaxy host has two kinematically separate components, likely in-falling and indicative of a recent interaction or merger with another galaxy. One 100-GHz continuum source $\sim120$ pkpc away is found to have both CO(4-3) and <a href="1-0">CI</a> emission lines and a further five protocluster members are identified from CO(4-3) emission alone, all at similar redshift ($\Delta v&lt;700$ km s$^{-1}$) and within a radius of $1.1^{\prime}$. Using photometry from the High Acuity Widefield K-band Imager $K_s$-band and the Dark Energy Survey $g, r, i, z$ and $Y$ bands, we find this protocluster harbours a rare, optically-dark, very massive $M_*\sim10^{12}$ ${M}_\odot$ galaxy. Comparisons with the TNG300 cosmological simulation puts this galaxy in a dark matter halo of $M_{DM}\sim3\times10^{13}$ ${M}_\odot$ which will evolve into a Coma-like DM halo ($M_{DM}\sim10^{15}$ ${M}_\odot$) by the present day.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Dark matter and dark radiation from chiral $U(1)$ gauge symmetry</strong>, Xiao He et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04718v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04718v1</a></p>

<p>We consider a simple model of a dark sector with a chiral $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. The anomaly-free condition requires at least five chiral fermions. Some of the fermions acquire masses through a vacuum expectation value of a Higgs field, and they are stable due to an accidental symmetry. This makes them dark matter candidates. If the dark sector was once in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model and dark radiation constraints are included, two-component dark matter may be needed since the number of massless fermions is restricted. To meet the requirements from dark matter direct detection experiments, the main component should be a Majorana fermion, and the secondary component should be a Dirac fermion. The amount of Dirac fermion dark matter must be sufficiently small to satisfy direct detection limits. We also discuss the possibility of testing an invisible dark photon at future lepton collider experiments, taking into account cosmological constraints.</p>

<p>Axions are hypothetical particles that could address both the strong charge-parity problem in quantum chromodynamics and the enigmatic nature of dark matter. However, if axions exist, their mass remains unknown, and they are expected to interact very weakly with the electromagnetic field, which explains why they have not been detected yet. This study proposes a way to substantially augment the axion-photon interaction by confining the photons within high-quality-factor dielectric resonators, increasing their intensity and lifetime and thus the possibility of interacting with axions in the background. In view of this, we study resonant axion-mediated photonic transitions in millimeter-sized spherical dielectric resonators, based on fully analytical calculations to the first order in perturbation theory. Such resonators exhibit high lifetime Mie resonances in the microwave part of the spectrum, with a separation that can be tailored with the radius of the sphere to match the expected axion frequency, allowing axion-mediated photonic transitions when particular selection rules are fulfilled. Such transitions are expected to be enhanced by more than ten orders of magnitude in the presence of the resonator, compared to transitions occurring in homogeneous space.</p>

<p>Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a leading detector technology for time-resolved single-photon counting from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared regime. The recent advancement in single-photon sensitivity in micrometer-scale superconducting wires opens up promising opportunities to develop large area SNSPDs with applications in low background dark matter detection experiments. We present the first detailed temperature-dependent study of a 4-channel $1\times1$ mm$^{2}$ WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array, including the internal detection efficiency, dark count rate, and importantly the coincident dark counts across pixels. The detector shows saturated internal detection efficiency for photon wavelengths ranging from 635 nm to 1650 nm, time jitter of about 160 ps for 1060 nm photons, and a low dark count rate of about $10^{-2}$ Hz. Additionally, the coincidences of dark count rate across pixels are studied for the first time in detail, where we observed an excess of correlated dark counts, which has important implications for low background dark matter experiments. The results presented is the first step towards characterizing and developing SMSPD array systems and associated background for low background dark matter detection experiments.</p>

<p>We present a simulation of the time-domain catalog for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope’s High-Latitude Time-Domain Core Community Survey. This simulation, called the Hourglass simulation, uses the most up-to-date spectral energy distribution models and rate measurements for ten extra-galactic time-domain sources. We simulate these models through the design reference Roman Space Telescope survey: four filters per tier, a five day cadence, over two years, a wide tier of 19 deg$^2$ and a deep tier of 4.2 deg$^2$, with $\sim$20% of those areas also covered with prism observations. We find that a science-independent Roman time-domain catalog, assuming a S/N at max of &gt;5, would have approximately 21,000 Type Ia supernovae, 40,000 core-collapse supernovae, around 70 superluminous supernovae, $\sim$35 tidal disruption events, 3 kilonovae, and possibly pair-instability supernovae. In total, Hourglass has over 64,000 transient objects, 11 million photometric observations, and 500,000 spectra. Additionally, Hourglass is a useful data set to train machine learning classification algorithms. We show that SCONE is able to photometrically classify Type Ia supernovae with high precision ($\sim$95%) to a z &gt; 2. Finally, we present the first realistic simulations of non-Type Ia supernovae spectral-time series data from Roman’s prism.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Constraints on the progenitor models of fast radio bursts from population synthesis with the first CHIME/FRB catalog</strong>, Min Meng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04986v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04986v1</a></p>

<p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic extragalactic radio transients with unknown origins. We performed comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations based on the first CHIME/FRB catalog to test whether the FRB population tracks the cosmic star formation history directly or requires a delay. By fully considering CHIME’s complex selection effects and beam response, we find that the hypothesis that the FRB population tracks the SFH is not ruled out by the current data, although a small delay is preferred. This is consistent with the scenario in which young magnetars formed through core-collapse supernovae serve as the progenitors of FRBs. However, we estimate the local volumetric rate of FRB sources with energy above $10^{38}$ erg to be $2.3^{+2.4}_{-1.2} \times 10^5~\rm{Gpc}^{-3}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$, which is consistent with previous results. This high volumetric rate means the core-collapse magnetar scenario alone cannot fully account for the observed population. Further theoretical efforts are required to explore alternative or additional progenitor channels for FRBs.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Model selection using the HII galaxy Hubble diagram</strong>, Jun-Jie Wei et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04819v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04819v1</a></p>

<p>The proposal to use HII galaxies (HIIGx) and giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHR) as standard candles to construct the Hubble diagram at redshifts beyond the current reach of Type Ia supernovae has gained considerable support recently with the addition of five new HIIGx discovered by JWST. The updated sample of 231 sources now extends the redshift range of these objects to $z\sim 7.5$, mapping the Universe’s expansion over $95\%$ of its current age. In this {\it Letter} we use these sources for model selection, and show that the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe is strongly favored by this probe over both flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, with relative Bayesian Information Criterion probabilities of, respectively, $91.8\%$, $7.4\%$ and $0.8\%$. A possible caveat with these results, however, is that an unknown dispersion, $\sigma_{\rm int}$, in the HIIGx standard candle relation can weaken the model comparisons. We find that the inclusion of $\sigma_{\rm int}$ as an additional, optimizable parameter makes the likelihoods of flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$ about equal, though at the expense of creating $\sim 2.5\sigma$ tension between our inferred matter density $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and its {\it Planck}-optimized value.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Modelling the selection of galaxy groups with end to end simulations</strong>, R. Seppi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04757v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04757v1</a></p>

<p>Feedback from supernovae and AGN shapes galaxy formation and evolution, yet its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray (ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population. Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about 0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors dominate over intrinsic scatter. Our selection model will enable the comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups and hydro simulations.</p>

<p>2025-06-05, <strong>Fast Luminous Extragalactic Transients in the VLA Sky Survey: Implications for the rates of Accretion-Induced Collapse Events, Fast Blue Optical Transients and Gamma Ray Burst Afterglows</strong>, Kritti Sharma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04522v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.04522v1</a></p>

<p>Radio wavelengths offer a unique window into high-energy astrophysical phenomena that may be obscured or too rapidly evolving to be captured at other wavelengths. Leveraging data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey, we perform a systematic search for fast, luminous transients with characteristic timescales $\lesssim 3$ years in the nearby universe ($z \leq 0.3$). We report the discovery of five such transients, and classify them based on their synchrotron emission energetics and host galaxy properties. From this sample, we derive observational constraints on the volumetric rates of certain corresponding transient classes. We limit the rates of accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs with dense circumstellar medium interaction (and those producing pulsar wind nebulae) at $\lesssim 1.10_{-0.90}^{+2.60}$% ($\lesssim 0.20_{-0.10}^{+5.80}$%) of the local Type Ia supernova rate, respectively, broadly consistent with theoretical predictions. For AT2018cow-like radio-bright luminous fast blue optical transients, we estimate a rare occurrence rate of $\lesssim 0.02_{-0.01}^{+0.32}$% of the local core-collapse supernova rate. We constrain the local volumetric rates of long- and short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to be $\lesssim 11.46_{-9.48}^{+26.28}$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim 80.88_{-66.90}^{+185.87}$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$, respectively. These estimates incorporate beaming corrections, with median detectable viewing angles derived from afterglow simulations of $\sim 0.4$ and $\sim 0.3$ radians for long- and short-duration GRBs. Our findings highlight the potential of radio surveys to uncover rare, energetic transients. We emphasize the critical role of coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up in fully characterizing these enigmatic events.</p>
