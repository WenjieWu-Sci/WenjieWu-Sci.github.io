<p>2024-10-24, <strong>Mergers of compact objects with cores of massive stars: evolution, r-process and multi-messenger signatures</strong>, Aldana Grichener et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18813v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18813v1</a></p>

<p>The study of massive binary systems has steadily progressed over the past decades, with increasing focus on their evolution, interactions and mergers, driven by improvements in computational modelling and observational techniques. In particular, when a binary system involves a massive giant and a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) that go through common envelope evolution (CEE), it might results in the merger of the compact object with the core of its giant companion, giving rise to various high energy astrophysical phenomena. We review the different evolutionary channels that lead to compact objects-core mergers, key physical processes with emphasis on the role of accretion physics, feasibility of r-process nucleosynthesis, expected observable electromagnetic, neutrinos and gravitational-waves (GWs) signatures, as well as potential correlation with detected core collapse supernovae (CCSNe), luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and low luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). After presenting our current understanding of these mergers, we conclude discussing prospects for future advancements.</p>

<p>2024-10-24, <strong>Fermion masses and mixing in SO(10) GUT with a universal two-zero texture</strong>, Gao-Xiang Fang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18743v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18743v1</a></p>

<p>We apply a universal two-zero texture (UTZT) to all mass matrices for matters in their flavour space in SO(10) GUT framework. This texture can be realised by assigning different charge for each family in a $Z_6$ symmetry. By fixing charged fermion masses at their best-fit values, we fit the rest 9 precisely measured observables (three angles and one CP-violating phase in the quark mixing, three angles in the lepton mixing, and two neutrino mass-squared differences) with 8 model parameters. The model fits all data of fermion masses and mixing very well and the leptonic CP-violating phase is predicted in the range $(90^\circ, 230^\circ)$. The model further predicts the right-handed neutrino masses, with the lightest and heaviest of order $10^9$ and $10^{12}$ GeV, respectively. Gauge unification and proton decay have been checked with the assumption of a breaking chain with two intermediate symmetries above the electroweak scale. It indicates that $\alpha_{\rm GUT}$ ranges in (0.022,0.032) as long as the assumption of economical choice of Higgs contents, and $M_{\rm GUT}$ should be bigger than $4.5\times 10^{15}$ GeV to meet the Super-K bound. We show effective mass $m_{ee}$ for neutrinoless double beta decay, which provides us with a possibility to test grand unification with neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.</p>

<p>2024-10-24, <strong>Demonstration of new MeV-scale capabilities in large neutrino LArTPCs using ambient radiogenic and cosmogenic activity in MicroBooNE</strong>, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18419v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18419v1</a></p>

<p>Large neutrino liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) experiments can broaden their physics reach by reconstructing and interpreting MeV-scale energy depositions, or blips, present in their data. We demonstrate new calorimetric and particle discrimination capabilities at the MeV energy scale using reconstructed blips in data from the MicroBooNE LArTPC at Fermilab. We observe a concentration of low energy ($&lt;$3 MeV) blips around fiberglass mechanical support struts along the TPC edges with energy spectrum features consistent with the Compton edge of 2.614 MeV $^{208}$Tl decay $\gamma$ rays. These features are used to verify proper calibration of electron energy scales in MicroBooNE’s data to few percent precision and to measure the specific activity of $^{208}$Tl in the fiberglass composing these struts, $(11.7 \pm 0.2 ~\text{(stat)} \pm 2.8~\text{(syst)})$ Bq/kg. Cosmogenically-produced blips above 3 MeV in reconstructed energy are used to showcase the ability of large LArTPCs to distinguish between low-energy proton and electron energy depositions. An enriched sample of low-energy protons selected using this new particle discrimination technique is found to be smaller in data than in dedicated CORSIKA cosmic ray simulations, suggesting either incorrect CORSIKA modeling of incident cosmic fluxes or particle transport modeling issues in Geant4.</p>

<p>2024-10-24, <strong>Stimulated Emission of Dark Matter via Thermal Scattering: Novel Limits for Freeze-In and eV Cold Dark Matter</strong>, Kodai Sakurai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18968v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18968v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, one of the present authors noticed a stimulated emission process of bosonic dark matter via the two-body decay of a mother particle in a thermal plasma similar to the operation principle of a laser in 2301.08735. In this paper, we show that in a $2 \to 2$ process, including a bosonic final particle (e.g., an axion or dark photon), the stimulated emission occurs as well due to a small angle scattering of the thermal mother particles and thus the phenomenon is more universal. Two important conclusions follow: (1) Care must be taken when studying the freeze-in production of a bosonic dark matter, as the abundance and momentum distribution of dark matter can differ significantly due to this effect. (2) eV-mass-range bosonic dark matter is special and theoretically well-motivated because models for freeze-in or other thermal production of dark matter include the parameter region of cold eV dark matter. We also study the dark matter mass effect for the stimulated emission.</p>

<p>2024-10-24, <strong>SENSEI at SNOLAB: Single-Electron Event Rate and Implications for Dark Matter</strong>, Itay M. Bloch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18716v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18716v1</a></p>

<p>We present results from data acquired by the SENSEI experiment at SNOLAB after a major upgrade in May 2023, which includes deploying 16 new sensors and replacing the copper trays that house the CCDs with a new light-tight design. We observe a single-electron event rate of $(1.39 \pm 0.11) \times 10^{-5}$ e$^-$/pix/day, corresponding to $(39.8 \pm 3.1)$ e$^-$/gram/day. This is an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to the previous lowest single-electron rate in a silicon detector and the lowest for any photon detector in the near-infrared-ultraviolet range. We use these data to obtain a 90% confidence level upper bound of $1.53 \times 10^{-5}$ e$^-$/pix/day and to set constraints on sub-GeV dark matter candidates that produce single-electron events. We hypothesize that the data taken at SNOLAB in the previous run, with an older tray design for the sensors, contained a larger rate of single-electron events due to light leaks. We test this hypothesis using data from the SENSEI detector located in the MINOS cavern at Fermilab.</p>

<p>2024-10-24, <strong>Measuring the boson mass of fuzzy dark matter with stellar proper motions</strong>, Gabriel d’Andrade Furlanetto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18659v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18659v1</a></p>

<p>Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) is among the most suitable candidates to replace WIMPs and to resolve the puzzling mystery of dark matter. A galactic dark matter halo made of these ultralight bosonic particles leads to the formation of a solitonic core surrounded by quantum interference patterns that, on average, reproduce a Navarro-Frenk-White-like mass density profile in the outskirts of the halo. The structure of such a core is determined once the boson mass and the total mass of the halo are set. We investigated the capability of future astrometric Theia-like missions to detect the properties of such a halo within the FDM model, namely the boson mass and the core radius. To this aim, we built mock catalogs containing three-dimensional positions and velocities of stars within a target dwarf galaxy. We exploited these catalogs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and found that measuring the proper motion of at least 2000 stars within the target galaxy, with uncertainty $\sigma_v \leq 3$ km/s on the velocity components, will constrain the boson mass and the core radius with 3\% accuracy. Furthermore, the transition between the solitonic core and the outermost NFW-like density profile could be detected with an uncertainty of 7\%. Such results would not only help to confirm the existence of FDM, but they would also be useful for alleviating the current tension between galactic and cosmological estimations of the boson mass, or demonstrating the need for multiple particles with a broad mass spectrum as naturally arise String Axiverse.</p>

<p>2024-10-24, <strong>Intermediate mass ratio inspirals in dark matter halos</strong>, Darkhan Shadykul et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18657v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18657v1</a></p>

<p>We study eccentric equatorial orbits of a stellar-mass black hole around an intermediate-mass slowly rotating Kerr black hole in the presence of gravitational radiation and a dark matter halo. The stellar-mass companion will inspiral towards the central black hole while emitting gravitational waves. The evolution is affected by the dynamical friction force caused by the presence of dark matter surrounding the intermediate-mass black hole at the core. Previous studies have shown that the presence of dark matter can be deduced from the gravitational waveforms. We explore the combined effects of slow-rotation of the central black hole and the presence of the dark matter halo around it on the system’s gravitational wave emission.</p>

<p>2024-10-24, <strong>On Evidence for Elastic Interactions in the Dark Sector</strong>, Jose Beltrán Jiménez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18645v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18645v1</a></p>

<p>The increasing quality of cosmological data has revealed some tensions that could be signalling the necessity of incorporating new physics into our cosmological model. One particularly intriguing possibility is the existence of elastic interactions between dark matter and dark energy. Not only do these interactions provide a natural mechanism to relief cosmological tensions, but there is also compelling observational evidence for them, to the extent that a detection could even be claimed. We review the potential of these scenarios in relation to the cosmological tensions and discuss distinctive signatures that can be probed with future data, thus providing a smoking gun for these interactions.</p>

<p>2024-10-24, <strong>Modelling the covariance matrix for the power spectra before and after the BAO reconstruction</strong>, Ruiyang Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18524v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18524v1</a></p>

<p>The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction plays a crucial role in cosmological analysis for spectroscopic galaxy surveys because it can make the density field effectively more linear and more Gaussian. The combination of the power spectra before and after the BAO reconstruction helps break degeneracies among parameters, then improve the constraints on cosmological parameters. It is therefore important to estimate the covariance matrix between pre- and post-reconstructed power spectra. In this work, we use perturbation theory to estimate the covariance matrix of the related power spectra multipoles, and check the accuracy of the derived covariance model using a large suite of dark matter halo catalogs at $z=0.5$. We find that the diagonal part of the auto covariance is well described by the Gaussian prediction, while the cross covariance deviates from the Gaussian prediction quickly when $k &gt; 0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Additionally, we find the non-Gaussian effect in the non-diagonal part of the cross covariance is comparable to, or even stronger than the pre-reconstruction covariance. By adding the non-Gaussian contribution, we obtain good agreement between analytical and numerical covariance matrices in the non-diagonal part up to $k \simeq 0.15\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The agreement in the diagonal part is also improved, but still under-predicts the correlation in the cross covariance block.</p>

<p>2024-10-24, <strong>On the chlorine abundance in H II regions</strong>, Maialen Orte-García et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18673v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18673v1</a></p>

<p>Chlorine (Cl) is a chemical element of the group of the halogens and is between the 17th and the 20th most abundant elements in the Solar System. It is thought to be produced from the capture of a proton or neutron by specific alpha-element isotopes during both hydrostatic and explosive oxygen burning, though some contribution may come from Type Ia supernovae. Cl lines are quite rare in stellar spectra, so most of the information available about its abundance comes from analyzing the emission lines of ionized nebulae, especially the collisionally excited lines of Cl2+ ([Cl III] {\lambda}{\lambda}5518,5538). Our goal is to accurately determine the Cl abundance in H II regions, and gather more information about its nucleosynthetic origin. For this work we used a sample of observations that encompasses the deepest spectra of H II regions available in the literature, from both the Milky Way and other galaxies in the local Universe, covering a range of oxygen (O) abundances, 12+log(O/H), from 7.18 to 8.70. As a first step, we determine the most representative electron temperature of the zone of the nebulae where the Cl2+ ion lies. To this aim we used a grid of photoionization models and diagnostics valid for other ions, as that parameter cannot be determined directly through [Cl III] lines. We then computed the total Cl abundance using different sets of ionization correction factors to account for the contribution from unseen ionization stages.</p>

<p>2024-10-24, <strong>Observational constraints on Gong-Zhang parametrizations in $f(Q)$ gravity</strong>, Romanshu Garg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18568v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18568v1</a></p>

<p>The expansion dynamics of the universe in $f(Q)$ gravity is examined with the Gong-Zhang kind of dark energy equation of state parameter. By considering the $f(Q)$ gravity form $f(Q)=Q+ \alpha Q^{n}$, we obtain the Hubble parameters in terms of redshift $z$. Using Bayesian statistical methods based on the $\chi^{2}$ minimization methodology, we constrain the model parameters by using the supernovae Pantheon sample with cosmic chronometer sample. The evolution of equation of state parameter, energy density, pressure with the statefinder diagnostic are thoroughly investigated to examine the universe evolution in model. We have also obtained the universe’s current age for these models. The considered models may exhibit either the quintom evolution or the future decelerating universe evolution.</p>

<p>2024-10-24, <strong>Spatio-spectral-temporal Modelling of Two Young Pulsar Wind Nebulae</strong>, A. Kundu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18386v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.18386v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations of a few young pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) have revealed their morphologies in some detail. Given the availability of spatio-spectral-temporal data, we use our multi-zone (1D) leptonic emission code to model the PWNe associated with G29.7-0.3 (Kes 75) and G21.5-0.9 (G21.5) and obtain (by-eye) constraints on additional model parameters compared to spectral-only modelling. Kes 75 is a Galactic composite supernova remnant (SNR) with an embedded pulsar, PSR J1846-0258. X-ray studies reveal rapid expansion of Kes 75 over the past two decades. PWN G21.5 is also a composite SNR, powered by PSR J1833-1034. For Kes 75, we study a sudden plasma bulk speed increase that may be due to the magnetar-like outbursts of the central pulsar. An increase of a few percent in this speed does not result in any significant change in the model outputs. For G21.5, we investigate different diffusion coefficients and pulsar spin-down braking indices. We can reproduce the broadband spectra and X-ray surface brightness profiles for both PWNe, and the expansion rate, flux over different epochs, and X-ray photon index vs epoch and central radius for Kes 75 quite well. The latter three features are also investigated for G21.5. Despite obtaining reasonable fits overall, some discrepancies remain, pointing to further model revision. We find similar values to overlapping parameters between our 1D code and those of an independent 0D dynamical code (TIDE). Future work will incorporate spatial data from various energy wavebands to improve model constraints.</p>
