<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Long-Term Multidimensional Models of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Progress and Challenges</strong>, H. -Thomas Janka et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14836v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14836v1</a></p>

<p>Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.</p>

<p>Preserving the unique role of the one Higgs doublet of the standard model, it is proposed that quark and lepton mass patterns, often ascribed to the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism using nonrenormalizable higher-dimensional terms, may be enforced in a renormalizable theory of just one Higgs doublet by the scotogenic mechanism with soft symmetry breaking in the dark sector. A revised version of the original $A_4$ model of charged leptons and neutrinos is discussed.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>PREFACE: A search for long-lived particles at the Large Hadron Collider</strong>, B. Hacisahinoglu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14598v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14598v1</a></p>

<p>The Standard Model (SM) fails to explain many problems (neutrino masses, dark matter, and matter-antimatter asymmetry, among others) that may be resolved with new particles beyond the Standard model (BSM). The fact that such new particles are not yet observed may be explained either by their too high mass or by very small coupling to SM particles. The latter case implies long lifetimes. Such long-lived particles (LLPs) would have signatures different from those of SM particles. Searches in the ``central region” are covered by the LHC general purpose experiments. The forward small angle region far from the interaction point (IP) is unexplored. Such particles would have large energy $E$ = $\mathcal{O}$(1~TeV) and Lorentz time dilation factor $\gamma = E/m \approx 10^2 - 10^{3}$, hence long decay distances. A new class of specialized LHC detectors dedicated to LLP searches has been proposed for the forward regions. Among these experiments, FASER is already operational, and FACET is under consideration at a location 100 meters from IP5 (the CMS intersection). However, some features of FACET require a specially enlarged beam pipe, which cannot be implemented for Run 4. In this study, we explore a simplified version of the proposed detector, PREFACE, compatible with the standard LHC beam pipe in the HL-LHC in Run 4. Realistic \textsc{Geant4} simulations are performed and the background is evaluated. A preliminary analysis of the physics potential with the PREFACE geometry indicates that several significant channels could be accessible with sensitivities comparable to FACET and other LLP searches.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Independent check of sporadic beta decay anomalies reported earlier by Parkhomov</strong>, Andrei E. Egorov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14519v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14519v1</a></p>

<p>A. Parkhomov reported in the past the detection of strong, short, sporadic, nearly everyday decay rate increases in $\beta$-isotopes placed at the focus of a concave mirror directed at a clear sky. He interpreted this effect as neutrino-induced decay. These neutrinos were assumed to be slow and arrive from space in the form of gravitationally collimated beams. We precisely replicated this experiment for the purpose of independent verification. We recorded about 50 days of data employing Geiger-counter-based signal and control detectors, $^{40}$K and $^{90}$Sr/$^{90}$Y isotopes as $\beta$-sources. We did not detect any significant difference between the data from signal and control detectors, both datasets obeyed the standard Poissonian process. Thus, we robustly excluded the hypothesized new effect. We suspect that A. Parkhomov was just misled by a trivial electromagnetic instability of his setup.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Efficient Monte Carlo Event Generation for Neutrino-Nucleus Exclusive Cross Sections</strong>, Mathias El Baz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14452v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14452v1</a></p>

<p>Modern neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions need to incorporate sophisticated nuclear models to achieve greater predictive precision. However, the computational complexity of these advanced models often limits their practicality for experimental analyses. To address this challenge, we introduce a new Monte Carlo method utilizing Normalizing Flows to generate surrogate cross sections that closely approximate those of the original model while significantly reducing computational overhead. As a case study, we built a Monte Carlo event generator for the neutrino-nucleus cross section model developed by the Ghent group. This model employs a Hartree-Fock procedure to establish a quantum mechanical framework in which both the bound and scattering nucleon states are solutions to the mean-field nuclear potential. The surrogate cross sections generated by our method demonstrate excellent accuracy with a relative effective sample size of more than $98.4 \%$, providing a computationally efficient alternative to traditional Monte Carlo sampling methods for differential cross sections.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Baryon-number-violating nucleon decays in sterile neutrino effective field theories</strong>, Tong Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14303v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14303v1</a></p>

<p>The search for baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decay provides an intriguing probe of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Future neutrino experiments will improve the sensitivity to BNV nucleon decays and can serve to search for dark particles. In this work, we study the sterile neutrino effective field theories (EFTs) with baryon number violation and the impact of light sterile neutrino on BNV nucleon decays. We revisit the dimension-6 and dimension-7 EFT operator bases with $|\Delta (B-L)|=2$ or $|\Delta (B-L)|=0$. They are then matched to the baryon chiral perturbation theory. We obtain the effective chiral Lagrangian at low energies and the BNV interactions between the sterile neutrino and baryons and mesons. The rates of nucleon decay to SM neutrinos or a sterile neutrino are calculated. We then show the constraints on the ultraviolet scale from nucleon decay search at Super-K. The correlation of two EFT operators and the dependence on the sterile neutrino mass are also investigated.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Noise Mitigation in Single Microwave Photon Counting by Cascaded Quantum Measurements</strong>, Alexandre S. May et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14804v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14804v1</a></p>

<p>While single-photon counting is routinely achieved in the optical domain, operational single microwave photon detectors (SMPDs) have only recently been demonstrated. SMPDs are critical for sensing weak signals from incoherent emitters, with applications ranging from the detection of individual electron spins and dark-matter candidates to advancements in hybrid quantum devices and superconducting quantum computing. These detectors offer a substantial advantage over quantum-limited amplification schemes by bypassing the standard quantum limit for power detection, therefore further reductions in their intrinsic noise are essential for advancing quantum sensing at microwave frequencies. Several SMPD designs utilize the state of a superconducting qubit to encode the detection of an itinerant photon, and rely on a non-destructive photon-qubit interaction. Here, we leverage this Quantum-Non-Demolition feature by repeatedly measuring the impinging photon with cascaded Four-Wave-Mixing processes and encoding the detection on several qubits. This cascaded detector mitigates the intrinsic local noise of individual qubits, achieving a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in intrinsic detector noise at the cost of halving the efficiency. We report an intrinsic sensitivity of $8(1)\times10^{-24}\text{W}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, with an operational sensitivity of $5.9(6)\times 10^{-23}\text{W}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ limited by thermal photons in the input line.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Disturbed cold gas in galaxy and structure formation</strong>, Siwei Zou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14705v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14705v1</a></p>

<p>Cold and cool gas (T $\leq 10^4$ K) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its interaction with galaxies remain poorly understood. Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z &gt; 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr &gt; 2 \AA) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (&gt; 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652$, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of $D = 38$ kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen$\gamma$ lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 $M_{\odot}$/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Effective field theory reproducing the MOND phenomenology based on a non-Abelian Yang-Mills graviphoton</strong>, Luc Blanchet et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14686v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14686v1</a></p>

<p>Motivated by the phenomenology of MOND, we propose a theory based on a fundamental non Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field with gravitational coupling constant (a “graviphoton”) emerging in a regime of weak acceleration, i.e. below the MOND acceleration scale. Using the formalism of the effective field theory and invoking a mechanism of gravitational polarization of the dark matter medium, we show that generic solutions of this theory reproduce the deep MOND limit without having to introduce in an ad hoc way an arbitrary function in the action. In this framework, MOND is due to the existence of a new sector of the standard model of particle physics. Furthermore, the model involves a fundamental violation of the local Lorentz invariance in the low acceleration regime. We show how to restore the general covariance of the model by adding one gravitational degree of freedom in the form of the scalar Khronon field.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Lopsided and Bulging Distribution of Satellites around Paired Halos. II. 3D Analysis and Dependence on Projection and Selection Effects</strong>, Qinglin Ma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14668v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14668v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the distribution of subhalos in the vicinity of dark matter halo pairs in the Illustris-TNG simulation. The satellites around halo pairs with separations $d_{\text{sep}} &gt; 0.5~h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$ exhibit a non-uniform distribution, which is a combined result of two distinct features: the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bulging'' distribution, characterized by an overabundance along the pairwise direction, and the</code>lopsided’’ distribution, which shows an overabundance in the region between the paired halos. The bulging signal is stronger for halo pairs that are more widely separated and involve less massive halos, while the lopsidedness strengthens as the halo mass increases. Both signals depend weakly on halo mass ratio, and are primarily contributed by subhalos that are relatively distant from host halos. These measurements can be broadly reproduced by the overlap effect, provided the spatial alignment of halos is properly taken into account. Our results imply that the lopsidedness and bulging distribution may arise from two distinct origins: the former is caused simply by the overlap of two closely placed halos, while the latter is driven by the alignment of halos with large-scale filamentary structures. We examine the impact of projection and selection effects by conducting the same analysis of satellite distribution in two dimensions and in a mock catalog that replicates the selection effects of the SDSS galaxy sample. We find that the 3D-to-2D projection significantly suppresses the bulging distribution, with particularly strong effects at large pair separations, low halo masses, and large halo mass ratios.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Lopsided and Bulging Distribution of Satellites around Paired Halos. I. Observational Measurements and Comparison with Halo-based Models</strong>, Yanhan Guo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14666v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14666v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the angular distribution of satellite galaxies in and around pairs of galaxy groups in SDSS and compare the results with the satellite distribution in pairs of dark matter halos by constructing mock catalogs that account for the same selection effects as the observational sample. We find that the angular distribution of satellites in both SDSS and the mock catalog exhibits a pronounced tendency towards lopsidedness, with satellites preferentially located between the two central galaxies. Additionally, there is a significant bulging distribution characterized by a higher concentration of satellites along the line connecting the two centrals compared to those found perpendicular to it. The lopsided and bulging distributions strengthen as pair separation and halo mass increase. The mock catalog successfully reproduces the observational results across all cases considered. We find that the lopsided and bulging distribution of satellites can largely be explained by overlapping two randomly selected halos matched in mass to the actual halo pairs, along with their surrounding satellite distribution, provided that the alignment between the orientations of the halos and the line connecting the halo pairs is taken into account. This suggests that the angular distribution of satellites is a natural consequence of the formation and evolution of large-scale structure in a $\Lambda$CDM universe, eliminating the need to introduce other physical origins.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Status of $\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM featuring a light bino-dominated LSP and a light singlet-like scalar under the LZ Experiment</strong>, Haijing Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14664v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14664v1</a></p>

<p>In the presence of a light singlet-like scalar state, the Bino-dominated dark matter (DM) candidate in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM exhibits significant differences from its counterpart in the MSSM, both in terms of intrinsic properties and mechanisms governing DM relic density and detection. Motivated by recent advancements in particle physics experiments, we systematically analyzed the implications of these developments for the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM framework featuring a light bino-dominated DM candidate and a light singlet-like scalar, ensuring theoretical consistency with empirical observations. Of paramount relevance are the latest direct detection constraints from the LZ experiment, SUSY searches at the LHC, and precision measurements of the Muon g-2 anomaly at Fermilab, which collectively impose complementary constraints on the model’s parameter space. Our investigation utilized the MultiNest algorithm to perform a rigorous parameter space scan, informed by the LZ(2022) experimental limits, while incorporating constraints from LHC Higgs analyses, Muon g-2 data, and B-physics observables. The results demonstrate that current experimental bounds, particularly stringent limits on SI and SD DM-nucleus scattering cross-sections, coupled with LHC exclusion limits on electroweakinos, strongly disfavor this scenario. Nonetheless, the model retains the capacity to naturally reproduce the Z boson mass and Standard Model-like Higgs boson mass, explain the Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment, and generate substantial corrections to the W boson mass. These findings exclusively manifest within the NMSSM framework, arising from the interplay between bino-dominated DM and singlino components, mediated through indispensable higgsino participation.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Modeling Tidal Streams and Tidal Tails around Galaxies Using Deep Wendelstein Imaging Data</strong>, Jan-Niklas Pippert et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14531v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14531v1</a></p>

<p>From the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter paradigm it is expected that galaxies merge and grow in their environments. These processes form various tidal features depending on the merger mass ratio, orbital parameters, and gas richness. We inspected 170 $g’$-band Abell cluster observations from the 2.1m Fraunhofer-Teleskop Wendelstein and identify 111 of such features from which we select nine streams and five tails. A fast and innovative technique was developed for determining their photometric properties. The model is a Gaussian, including higher-order moments to describe the light profile in slices perpendicular to the elongation direction. From these models, FWHM apertures are generated. The method was developed, tested, and applied on the selected features and corresponding $g$- and $r$-band data from the Legacy Survey DR10. Regarding the novel modeling approach, we can measure surface and total brightnesses with precisions of 4% and 7%, respectively. Mean stream width precision, which also translates to the mean $R_\mathrm{e}$ along the feature is on average within 3% uncertainty. The measured streams have on average a surface brightness of $\sim26.25$ $g’$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and are dimmer than the tails in our sample ($\sim25.14$ $g’$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$). We infer that the progenitors of our streams can come from dwarfs, early-type galaxies or disks, based on the streams structural parameters. Furthermore, brightnesses and colors of the streams and tails are consistent with those of galaxies that populate the red sequence in the Coma cluster within $2\sigma$.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Beyond Freeze-Out: A Novel Freeze-in Mechanism for Dark Matter via Supercooled Phase Transitions</strong>, Seyed Yaser Ayazi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14526v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14526v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a novel freeze-in mechanism for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), facilitated by a supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the early universe. Unlike the conventional freeze-out and freeze-in scenarios, this mechanism allows WIMPs to acquire their relic abundance through a non-equilibrium production process following a rapid entropy injection. We explore multiple dark matter (DM) candidates, including vector, fermionic, and scalar-mediated models, and identify fermionic DM with a pseudoscalar mediator as the most viable candidate for this mechanism. The study demonstrates that FOPT dilutes preexisting DM density and simultaneously induces a rapid mass increase, preventing thermal re-equilibration and enabling DM production via freeze-in. Additionally, we analyze the gravitational wave (GW) signals associated with FOPT, identifying parameter regions detectable by future GW observatories such as LISA and UDECIGO. This framework offers a compelling alternative to traditional WIMP and Feebly Interacting Massive Particle (FIMP) scenarios, providing new avenues for DM model building and experimental verification.</p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a promising candidate for dark matter, as they can form in the very early universe without invoking new particle physics. This work explores PBH formation within a curvaton scenario featuring an ultraslow-roll (USR) phase. An inflaton–curvaton mixed field model is presented, where the inflaton drives early inflation and then transits into the USR phase, amplifying the small-scale curvature perturbation. During inflation, the curvaton generates entropy perturbation, which later converts into curvature perturbation after the curvaton decays in the radiation-dominated era. Using the $\delta N$ formalism, we compute the power spectrum of the total primordial curvature perturbation and analyze the relevant non-Gaussianity. Our results show that adding a curvaton field not only has a significant impact on primordial non-Gaussianity, but also introduces more complex inflationary dynamics, even saving the inflaton potentials that generate too low scalar spectral indices. Our model can produce PBHs with mass around $10^{-14}\,M_\odot$ that account for all dark matter, while remaining consistent with current observational constraints.</p>

<p>2025-02-20, <strong>Analysis of $q_\mathrm{rec}^2$-distribution for $B\to K M_X$ and $B\to K^* M_X$ decays in a scalar-mediator dark-matter scenario</strong>, Alexander Berezhnoy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14313v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.14313v1</a></p>

<p>We demonstrate that the scalar-mediator dark-matter scenario is consistent with the experimental data on the decay $B\to K M_X$ and provides a good description of the shape of the observed excess. Within this scenario, the interaction with dark-matter particles leads to approximately the same excess in $\Gamma(B\to K^* M_X)$ and $\Gamma(B\to K M_X)$ compared to the Standard Model; also the differential distributions of the excess events are similar in shape in the variable $q_\mathrm{rec}^2$ measured by experiment.</p>
