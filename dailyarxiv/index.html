<p>2025-10-29, <strong>Extra dip in ultrahigh energy neutrino spectrum from generalized uncertainty principle</strong>, J. Barranco et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25635v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.25635v1</a></p>

<p>We revisited the scenario of a resonant enhancement in the oscillation probability due to an interaction potential between neutrinos and dark matter with the novelty of the inclusion of the generalized uncertainty principle. It is shown that a new resonant conversion appears at higher energies. This effect could be tested with future neutrino data as new dips in the ultrahigh energy neutrino flux.</p>

<p>We present a fast method for obtaining fully analytical approximations for gravitational waveforms produced by merging of neutron stars and/or black holes for the earliest stages of the merger process. The obtained analytical formula is compared with numerical calculations, its accuracy and limits of applicability are evaluated. Our results may be useful not only for the earliest evalution of properties of the nature of binary system in gravitational-wave detectors but also will give early alerts for gamma-ray, optical and neutrino observatories.</p>

<p>2025-10-29, <strong>NLO event generation for LHC neutrinos and application to flux measurements at FASER</strong>, Peter Krack et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25486v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.25486v1</a></p>

<p>The LHC generates an intense beam of high-energy neutrinos in the forward direction, whose scientific potential has been left unexploited for many years. The FASER and SND@LHC experiments, operating since 2023, have recently measured LHC neutrinos for the first time. In this contribution we discuss how to produce accurate predictions, including NLO QCD corrections and modern parton shower algorithms, for present and future LHC neutrino experiments, including those at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF). To this end, the energy and rapidity distribution of the LHC neutrinos is encoded in a LHAPDF grid interfaced to the neutrino DIS event generator in the POWHEG-BOX-RES framework. This Monte Carlo tool enables the modelling of differential distributions that are sensitive to hadronic final states, initial- and final-state radiation, and realistic acceptance and selection cuts. As a first application, we deploy this event generator to compute fast-interpolation grids and carry out a first determination of the LHC forward neutrino fluxes directly from FASER data using the NNPDF fitting methodology.</p>

<p>2025-10-29, <strong>A Dual-Resolution Prescription in the $S_N$ Method for Boltzmann Neutrino Transport I: Proof of Principle and the Resolution of Collision Term</strong>, Akira Ito et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25274v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.25274v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a dual-resolution prescription meant for the Boltzmann neutrino transport, in which the advection and collision terms are calculated with different angular resolutions in momentum space. The purpose is to address the issue of the low resolution that afflicts the $S_N$ method in the multi-dimensional neutrino transport simulations for core-collapse supernovae. We handle with a high resolution the advection term alone, assuming that the collision term does not require such high resolutions. To confirm this surmise as well as our new conversion scheme, from low- to high-angular resolutions and vice versa, we run a couple of experimental one-zone (in space) simulations. Neutrino scatterings on nucleons are considered with small recoils fully taken into account whereas the advection term is replaced by the angle- and energy-dependent source terms that are designed to mimic the results of a Boltzmann simulation, inducing the anisotropy in momentum space. For the conversion from a low-resolution distribution function to a high-resolution one, we employ a polynomial interpolations in the zenith and azimuth directions separately with the number conservation and continuity (and periodicity only in the azimuth direction). We find that this dual-resolution scheme works well and that the current angular resolution employed in the canonical supernova simulations with our Boltzmann solver or a bit better in the $\phi_\nu$ direction will be sufficient for the collision terms if they are coupled with the advection terms calculated with a high-angular resolution via this prescription.</p>

<p>2025-10-29, <strong>Characterization of the Li$_2$WO$_4$ crystal as a cryogenic scintillating calorimeter</strong>, D. L. Helis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25272v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.25272v1</a></p>

<p>A wide range of scintillating bolometers is under investigation for applications in the search for rare events and processes beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we report the first measurement of a natural, non-molybdenum-doped, lithium tungstate (LWO) crystal operated underground as a scintillating cryogenic calorimeter. The detector achieved a baseline energy resolution of 0.5 keV RMS with a low-energy threshold of about 1.5 keV. The simultaneous readout of heat and light enabled particle identification, revealing a clear separation between $\beta/\gamma$, $\alpha$, and nuclear recoil populations above 300 keV, with a light-yield-based particle discrimination better than $6\sigma$. These results, fully comparable with those achieved with other compounds in the field, demonstrate that LWO is a promising candidate for rare-event searches. In particular, the combination of excellent radio-purity (with U/Th levels below 0.5 mBq/kg) and sensitivity to neutron interactions via the $^6$Li(n,$\alpha$)$^3$H reaction makes this material an attractive option for next-generation experiments on dark matter, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, and spin-dependent interactions.</p>

<p>2025-10-29, <strong>Prospects for a fourth generation of leptons in a 13 TeV p-p collider</strong>, Ramkrishna Joshi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25190v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.25190v1</a></p>

<p>In the Standard Model, three discovered generations of leptons and quarks are known to date. However, speculations about existence of next generations have a strong foothold. In this study, we sequentially extrapolate the Standard Model to include a fourth generation of leptons (l4, nu4) with a massive Dirac neutrino. We perform MC simulated event generation of pp -&gt; l4 l4(bar) scattering processes at an LHC-like p-p collider with sqrt(s) = 13 TeV by considering l4 mass of 190 GeV and nu4 mass of 100 GeV with PYTHIA. We demonstrate mass constraints of sequential leptons from oblique parameters and study important jet and lepton kinematics in our simulation with CMS like constraints. Fourth generation neutrino is stable in this scenario making l4 -&gt; W nu4 the only dominant channel in collider searches. With the cut-flow, we achieve global excess of (1.46 +/- 0.068(stat.)) sigma and local excess of (3.33 +/- 0.241(stat.)) sigma in the 180-300 GeV signal window. Missing Transverse Energy (MET) provides clean signature of nu4. We assess discovery potential of the BSM lepton against lepton mass, center-of-mass energy (Ecom) and luminosities. Higher luminosities and Ecom are promising to probe BSM moderate mass lepton scenarios at present and future colliders.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>Characterization of the Three-Flavor Composition of Cosmic Neutrinos with IceCube</strong>, R. Abbasi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24957v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24957v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinos oscillate over cosmic distances. Using 11.4 years of IceCube data, the flavor composition of the all-sky neutrino flux from 5\,TeV–10\,PeV is studied. We report the first measurement down to the $\mathcal{O}$(TeV) scale using events classified into three flavor-dependent morphologies. The best fit flavor ratio is $f_e:f_{\mu}:f_{\tau}\,=\,0.30:0.37:0.33$, consistent with the standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation model. Each fraction is constrained to be $&gt;0$ at $&gt;$ 90\% confidence level, assuming a broken power law for cosmic neutrinos. We infer the flavor composition of cosmic neutrinos at their sources, and find production via neutron decay lies outside the 99\% confidence interval.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>Impact of $ν$SMEFT operators on low-scale leptogenesis</strong>, Kaori Fuyuto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24843v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24843v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the impact of higher-dimensional operators on low-scale leptogenesis (LG) via oscillations of right-handed neutrinos within the neutrino-extended Standard Model Effective Field Theory ($\nu$SMEFT) and discuss the connection to neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$). Focusing on a dimension-six, lepton number conserving operator, we explore how new interactions can significantly alter the production and equilibration dynamics of right-handed neutrinos. We derive the relevant quantum kinetic equations incorporating both renormalizable and non-renormalizable interactions and perform a comprehensive numerical analysis for benchmark scenarios in both the oscillatory and overdamped regimes. Our results reveal that even in the absence of explicit lepton number violation by the operator, it can enhance or suppress the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) by several orders of magnitude, depending on the EFT scale. We further connect these effects to predictions for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, demonstrating that the same operator can lead to enhanced decay rates, potentially within reach of the next generation of experiments. Our findings indicate that the observation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ could rule out a large part of the parameter space for successful low-scale LG within the $\nu$SMEFT, implying low RHN masses and low reheating temperatures.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>Neutrino thermalization via randomization on a quantum processor</strong>, Oriel Kiss et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24841v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24841v1</a></p>

<p>The dynamical evolution of neutrino flavor in supernovae can be modeled by an all-to-all spin Hamiltonian with random couplings. Simulating such two-local Hamiltonian dynamics remains a major challenge, as methods with controllable accuracy require circuit depths that increase at least linearly with system size, exceeding the capabilities of current quantum devices. The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis predicts that these systems should thermalize, a behavior confirmed in small-scale classical simulations. In this work, we investigate flavor thermalization in much larger systems using random quantum circuits as an empirical tool to emulate the non-local dynamics, and demonstrate that the thermal behavior can be reproduced using a depth independent of the system size. By simulating dynamics of over one hundred qubits, we find that the thermalization time grows approximately as the square root of the system size, consistent with predictions from semi-classical methods. Beyond this specific result, our study illustrates that near-term quantum devices are useful tools to test and validate empirical classical methods. It also highlights a new application of random circuits in physics, providing insight into complex many-body dynamics that are classically intractable.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>Precise tracking spectroscopy of beta-gamma cascade in nuclear decay</strong>, PandaX Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24612v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24612v1</a></p>

<p>Nuclear $\beta$ decay, a sensitive probe of nuclear structure and weak interactions, has become a precision test bed for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), driven by recent advances in spectroscopic techniques. Here we introduce tracking spectroscopy of $\beta$-$\gamma$ cascades, a method that reconstructs decay vertices while simultaneously detecting $\beta$ particles and all associated de-excitation energies. Using the PandaX-4T detector operated as a tracking spectrometer, we obtain a precise and unbiased decay scheme of $^{214}$Pb, a key background isotope in searches for dark matter and Majorana neutrinos. For the first time, transitions of $^{214}$Pb to both the ground and excited states of $^{214}$Bi are measured concurrently, revealing discrepancies in branching ratios of up to 4.7$\sigma$ relative to previous evaluations. Combined with state-of-the-art theoretical spectral shape calculations, these results establish a new benchmark for background modeling in rare-event searches and highlight the potential of tracking spectroscopy as a versatile tool for fundamental physics and nuclear applications.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>XRISM constraints on unidentified X-ray emission lines, including the 3.5 keV line, in the stacked spectrum of ten galaxy clusters</strong>, XRISM Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24560v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24560v1</a></p>

<p>We stack 3.75 Megaseconds of early XRISM Resolve observations of ten galaxy clusters to search for unidentified spectral lines in the $E=$ 2.5-15 keV band (rest frame), including the $E=3.5$ keV line reported in earlier, low spectral resolution studies of cluster samples. Such an emission line may originate from the decay of the sterile neutrino, a warm dark matter (DM) candidate. No unidentified lines are detected in our stacked cluster spectrum, with the $3\sigma$ upper limit on the $m_{\rm s}\sim$ 7.1 keV DM particle decay rate (which corresponds to a $E=3.55$ keV emission line) of $\Gamma \sim 1.0 \times 10^{-27}$ s$^{-1}$. This upper limit is 3-4 times lower than the one derived by Hitomi Collaboration et al. (2017) from the Perseus observation, but still 5 times higher than the XMM-Newton detection reported by Bulbul et al. (2014) in the stacked cluster sample. XRISM Resolve, with its high spectral resolution but a small field of view, may reach the sensitivity needed to test the XMM-Newton cluster sample detection by combining several years worth of future cluster observations.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>Multi-messenger constraints on transient accelerators of ultra-high energy cosmic rays</strong>, Antonio Condorelli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24516v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24516v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains an open questions in astrophysics. We explore two primary scenarios for the distribution of UHECR sources, assuming that their production rate follows either the cosmic star-formation-rate or stellar-mass density. By jointly fitting the UHECR energy spectrum and mass composition measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory above the ankle (10^{18.7} eV), we derive constraints on the acceleration mechanisms, source energetics, and elemental abundances at escape. Using these constraints, we generate sky maps above 40 EeV based on a catalog of over 400,000 galaxies out to 350 Mpc, providing a near-infrared flux-limited sample that maps the two stellar-activity tracers across the full sky. A crucial factor in understanding UHECR propagation is the influence of large-scale cosmic structures, particularly galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound systems in the Universe, which are filled with magnetized diffuse plasma. Intermittent sources hosted in galaxies within such structures, coupled with cosmic magnetic fields, shape the observed UHECR arrival directions and provide insights into the burst rate of the sources. We show that these environments can significantly impact UHECR transport, making them particularly opaque to heavy nuclei. Additionally, we compute the expected secondary neutrino and photon fluxes from UHECR interactions in these environments and compare them with current experimental limits, constraining the maximum energy that particles can achieve. Finally, we assess the compatibility of these constraints with astrophysical candidates, identifying long gamma-ray bursts as the most promising sources.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>Optimising Underwater Neutrino Telescopes for All-Flavour Point Source Sensitivity</strong>, Iwan Morton-Blake et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24395v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24395v1</a></p>

<p>High-energy neutrino astronomy has advanced rapidly in recent years, with IceCube, KM3NeT, and Baikal-GVD establishing a diffuse astrophysical flux and pointing to promising source candidates. These achievements mark the transition from first detections to detailed source studies, motivating next-generation detectors with larger volumes, improved angular resolution, and full neutrino-flavour sensitivity. We present a performance study of large underwater neutrino telescopes, taking the proposed TRIDENT array in the South China Sea as a case study, with a focus on comparing the performance of various detector configurations against the TRIDENT baseline design. Both track-like events primarily from muon neutrinos, which provide precise directional information, and cascade events from all flavours, which offer superior energy resolution, diffuse-source sensitivity, and all-sky flavour coverage, are included to achieve a balanced performance across source types. The time to discover potential astrophysical sources with both track- and cascade-like events is used as the figure of merit to compare a variety of detector design choices. Our results show that, for a fixed number of optical modules, simply enlarging the instrumented volume does not inherently lead to improved performance, while taller strings can provide modest gains across all detector channels, within engineering constraints. Distributing dense clusters of strings over a large volume is found to generally worsen discovery potential compared to the baseline layout. Finally, the optical properties of the sea-water emerge as the key factor dictating the optimisation of detector layout, highlighting the need for in-situ measurements and early deployment of optical modules to guide the final array configuration.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>Design and characterization of a photosensor system for the RELICS experiment</strong>, Jijun Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24196v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24196v2</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we present the design and characterization of a photosensor system developed for the RELICS experiment. A set of dynamic readout bases was designed to mitigate photomultiplier tube (PMT) saturation caused by intense cosmic muon backgrounds in the surface-level RELICS detector. The system employs dual readout from the anode and the seventh dynode to extend the PMT’s linear response range. In particular, our characterization and measurements of Hamamatsu R8520-406 PMTs confirm stable operation under positive high-voltage bias, extending the linear response range by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, a model of PMT saturation and recovery was developed to evaluate the influence of cosmic muon signals in the RELICS detector. The results demonstrate the system’s capability to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) signals under surface-level cosmic backgrounds, and suggest the potential to extend the scientific reach of RELICS to MeV-scale interactions.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>Vortex Creep Heating in Neutron Star Cooling: New Insights into Thermal Evolution of Heavy Neutron Stars</strong>, Yoonhak Nam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24167v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24167v1</a></p>

<p>Neutron stars provide unique laboratories for probing physics of dense nuclear matter under extreme conditions. Their thermal and luminosity evolution reflects key internal properties such as the equation of state (EoS), nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity, envelope composition, and magnetic field, and so on. Recent observations [\textit{e.g.}, V. Abramkin \textit{et al.,} ApJ \textbf{924}, 128 (2022)] have revealed unexpectedly warm old neutron stars, which cannot be explained by standard neutrino-photon cooling models. The failure of the standard cooling models implies the presence of additional internal heating mechanism. Building on the previous study [M. Fujiwara \textit{et al}., JCAP \textbf{03}, 051 (2024)], which proposed vortex creep heating (VCH) from the frictional motion of superfluid vortices as a viable mechanism, we extend the cooling framework to include both VCH and direct Urca (DUrca) processes. These are implemented in our code to explore their combined impact, particularly for massive neutron stars where DUrca operates. By varying rotational parameters ($P$, $\dot{P}$, $P_0$), EoS models (APR, BSk24), pairing gaps, and envelope compositions, we examine how heating-cooling interplay shapes the temperature evolution.

<p>This is a follow-up of arXiv:2412.07470 [hep-th]. A simplified version of the SM plus gravity, put forward there, is presented here and some of its aspects delved into. The basic structure consists of two sectors, left and right, with chirally mirror fermions and scalars, as well as $SU(3)$ and $U(1)$ gauge fields, while the $SU(2)$ gauge fields as well as the metric are in common to both sectors. This structure is dictated by the request to cancel all dangerous anomalies. The left sector consists of the fermion, gauge and scalar fields of the SM, now minimally coupled to gravity. The right sector is a mirror image of the left, with distinct fields, except the metric and the $SU(2)$ gauge potentials. The first new aspect is the proposed and motivated interpretation of the right sector as the dark matter one. The second new subject covered here is Weyl symmetry and its possible application to cosmology and its theoretical fallout on unitarity and renormalization of the model. A background solution of the Weyl invariant theory is derived, which may apply to the very early stages of the universe. This solution also suggests interesting applications to the cosmological constant problem. On the quantum field theory side the subject of Weyl symmetry and Weyl anomalies is reviewed and, among other things, an application of the WZ terms is illustrated to the problem of one-loop quantization of the model which may avoid negative norm states.</p>

<p>Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches. Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging low superconducting gap energies.</p>

<p>The nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the biggest mysteries in physics today. Dark matter direct detection experiments look for nuclear recoil signals from DM-nucleus elastic scattering, which can be used to characterise DM. Nuclear modelling of the target nucleus may impact the predicted DM-nucleus scattering rates, and affect interpretation of experimental signals. In this work, we investigate the impact of nuclear shell model interactions on DM nuclear responses for silicon and germanium targets using a SuperCDMS-like experimental parameters. Nuclear uncertainties resulting from shell model interaction choice in the nuclear form factors are roughly retained at the scattering rate and exclusion limit levels for certain nuclear responses.</p>

<p>Periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior have become attractive topics for studying particle dynamics and gravitational wave emission in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). This study systematically investigates periodic orbits around black holes and their gravitational wave radiation in three dark matter halo environments: NFW, Beta, and Moore models. The dark matter distribution in these models can be effectively incorporated using two parameters – the dark matter characteristic mass and halo characteristic radius. Our results reveal that for a larger dark matter mass and a smaller characteristic radius, the shapes of the periodic orbits and the corresponding gravitational waveforms show more significant deviations from the Schwarzschild case. As the halo characteristic radius increases, the orbital shapes and waveform characteristics gradually converge with the Schwarzschild black hole results. For the different dark matter halo models, the NFW and Beta models produce nearly indistinguishable results, while the Moore model shows distinctly different effects. These findings enhance our understanding of dark matter halo effects on gravitational wave signatures and may provide constraints for future space-based detectors.</p>

<p>We study cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) in Higgs inflation, wherein the inflaton is a scalar field with quartic self-coupling $\lambda$ and a nonminimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, and which may, but need not be, the Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM). We find an explosive particle production peaked on a characteristic comoving wavenumber $k\sim \xi^{2/3} a H$ with a peak occupation number that scales with $\xi$. This new peak in production can easily dominate over the conventional (minimally coupled inflation) CGPP even for modest values of $\xi$. The results apply for a wide range of $\xi$, e.g., as low as $\xi=10$, which can be realized for the Standard Model Higgs given suitable RG flow of the quartic coupling. We discuss implications for late time relics such as dark matter.</p>

<p>We investigate the dynamical instability of a self-gravitating thermal system in the quantum regime, where Fermi degeneracy pressure becomes significant. Using a truncated Fermi-Dirac distribution and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we identify marginally stable configurations following Chandrasekhar’s criterion. While Fermi pressure stabilizes a system against gravitational collapse in Newtonian gravity, in general relativity it can instead drive the instability, enabling collapse even at low temperatures. We discuss implications for the formation of massive black holes in the early Universe through the gravothermal collapse of dark matter.</p>

<p>The DAMA experiment’s long-standing claim of dark matter detection remains a key open issue in astroparticle physics. Independent verification requires NaI(Tl)-based detectors with enhanced low-energy sensitivity. Current detectors rely on photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) which features limited detection efficiency, intrinsic radioactivity, and high noise at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&amp;D project that developed a proof of concept NaI(Tl) detector where siliconphotomultipliers (SiPMs) have been used instead of PMTs, offering higher photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most of all, a reduction of two orders of magnitude in the dark noise. The setup includes a custom cryostat operating at approximately 80 K. We report the first characterization of an approximately 360 g NaI(Tl) crystal coupled to a 5 x 5 cm SiPM matrix, yielding 4.5 photoelectrons\keV after crosstalk correction. This promising result demonstrates the feasibility of SiPM-based readout for NaI(Tl) and paves the way for future large-scale dark matter experiments.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>Modified Gravity with Nonminimal Curvature-Matter Couplings: A Framework for Gravitationally Induced Particle Creation</strong>, Francisco S. N. Lobo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24371v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24371v1</a></p>

<p>Modified gravity theories with a nonminimal coupling between curvature and matter offer a compelling alternative to dark energy and dark matter by introducing an explicit interaction between matter and curvature invariants. Two of the main consequences of such an interaction are the emergence of an additional force and the non-conservation of the energy–momentum tensor, which can be interpreted as an energy exchange between matter and geometry. By adopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different approaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced particle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible thermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar–tensor formulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle creation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that irreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration through a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds: the total entropy, from both the apparent horizon and enclosed matter, increases monotonically and saturates in the de Sitter phase, imposing constraints on the allowed particle production dynamics. Furthermore, we present brief reviews of other theoretical descriptions of matter creation processes. Specifically, we consider approaches based on the Boltzmann equation and quantum-based aspects and discuss the generalization of the Klein–Gordon equation, as well as the problem of its quantization in time-varying gravitational fields.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>A Viable New Model for Dark Matter</strong>, X. G. Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24114v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24114v1</a></p>

<p>We present a new model of the dark sector involving Dirac fermion dark matter, with axial coupling to a dark photon which provides a portal to Standard Model particles. In the non-relativistic limit, this implies that the dominant effective operator relevant to direct detection is ${\cal O}_8$. The resulting event rate for direct detection is suppressed by either the dark matter velocity or the momentum transfer. In this scenario there are much wider regions of the dark parameter space that are consistent with all of the existing constraints associated with thermal relic density, direct detection and collider searches.</p>

<p>Tritium from tritiated methane (CH$_3$T) calibration is a significant impurity that restricts the sensitivity of the PandaX-4T dark matter detection experiment in the low-energy region. The CH$_3$T removal is essential for PandaX-4T and other liquid xenon dark matter direct detection experiments, as CH$_3$T serves as a critical component for low-energy calibration. To eliminate CH$_3$T, the xenon in the detector is suitably recuperated, leaving 1.8 bar of xenon gas inside, and the detector is flushed with heated xenon gas. Concurrently, leveraging the lower boiling point of methane relative to xenon, the PandaX-4T cryogenic distillation system is effectively utilized to extract CH$_3$T from xenon after optimizing the operational parameters. Following the commissioning run, 5.7 tons of xenon are purified via the distillation method. Recent data indicate that the CH$_3$T concentration reduces from $3.6\times10^{-24}$ mol/mol to $5.9\times10^{-25}$ mol/mol, demonstrating that gas purging and distillation are effective in removing CH$_3$T, even at concentrations on the order of $10^{-24}$ mol/mol.</p>

<p>Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\gtrsim$40~days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only $\sim$1-3\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07~M$_\odot$), similar to SN~1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5~foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba~II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba~II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modelling of the growing number of peculiar transients.</p>

<p>We have performed the dynamical system analysis to obtain the critical point in which, the value of the geometric and dynamical parameters satisfy the late-time cosmic behavior of the Universe. At the outset, the modified Friedmann equations have been reformulated into a system of coupled differential equations to ensure that the minimal set of equations required for a second-order $f(Q)$ gravity. Then these equations are solved numerically to constrain the parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and high-precision Pantheon$^+$ Type Ia Supernovae datasets are used to constrain the parameters. The evolution of key cosmological parameters indicates that the model exhibits quintessence-like behavior at present, with a tendency to converge towards the $\Lambda$CDM model at late-times. The dynamic system analysis provided the critical points that correspond to different phases of the Universe, which are analyzed in detail. The existence of a stable de Sitter attractor confirms the accelerating behavior of the model.</p>

Hall et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24620v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24620v1</a></p>

<p>Over the past LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA (LVK) observing runs, it has become increasingly clear that identifying the next electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave (GW) neutron star mergers will likely be more challenging compared to the case of GW170817. The rarity of these GW events, and their electromagnetic counterparts, motivates rapid searches of any candidate binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected by the LVK. We present our extensive photometric and spectroscopic campaign of the candidate counterpart AT2025ulz to the low-significance GW event S250818k, which had a ${\sim} 29\%$ probability of being a BNS merger. We demonstrate that during the first five days, the luminosity and color evolution of AT2025ulz are consistent with both kilonova and shock cooling models, although a Bayesian model comparison shows preference for the shock cooling model, underscoring the ambiguity inherent to early data obtained over only a few days. Continued monitoring beyond this window reveals a rise and color evolution incompatible with kilonova models and instead consistent with a supernova. This event emphasizes the difficulty in identifying the electromagnetic counterparts to BNS mergers and the significant allotment of observing time necessary to robustly differentiate kilonovae from impostors.</p>

<p>We present a detailed chemical analysis study of 16 candidate metal-poor stars, previously identified with 2dF+AAOmega, using X-Shooter spectra and the Korg 1D LTE spectral synthesis code. We generally confirm the earlier metallicity estimates and reveal four EMP ([Fe/H] $&lt; -3$) stars in the current sample. Two of these stars, including the most metal-poor at [Fe/H] = $-3.83 \pm 0.07$, are kinematically associated with the GSE accretion event, increasing the number of known GSE stars with [Fe/H] $&lt; -3.5$ to eight. From the X-Shooter spectra we also determine abundances for 16 elements, with the element-to-iron abundance ratios generally consistent with high-resolution studies of Galactic halo stars. Within the sample, we identify three peculiar stars: the first is a GSE nitrogen enhanced metal poor (NEMP; [N/Fe] $= 1.62 \pm 0.10$ and [C/Fe] $= 0.27 \pm 0.08$) star with unusually high Na ([Na/Fe] $= 2.28 \pm 0.07$) and Li (A(Li)$_{\rm 3DNLTE} = 1.90 \pm 0.08$) abundances, but which lacks any enhancement in [Al/Fe] or [Mg/Fe]. The second is a halo r-II star significantly enhanced in Sr ([Sr/Ba] $= 0.37 \pm 0.08$), suggesting mixture of r-process and s-process enrichment, uncommon for r-II stars. Whilst the third is a halo star very depleted in N ([N/Fe] $&lt; -1.13$), with low C ([C/Fe] $= -0.36 \pm 0.08$) and otherwise ‘normal’ [X/Fe] abundances, suggesting enrichment with Type II supernova that proceeds enrichment from massive AGB stars. This study reveals the substantial degree of chemical diversity in the stellar populations which assembled the early Milky Way.</p>

<p>We present the decadal brightening of non-thermal emission flux in the northeastern filament of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), which highlights dynamic processes in the forward shock. This filament, characterized by the highest particle acceleration rate among Cas A’s outer shells, offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate underlying astrophysical mechanisms. Since 2000, the non-thermal flux has increased by several tens of percent before plateauing, while the spectral shape has remained largely unchanged. Over the past two decades, the filament’s morphology has evolved significantly, splitting into two distinct sections. Detailed analysis reveals contrasting behaviors: one section shows a flux increase followed by saturation, while the other maintains a steady flux. These differences likely arise from nonlinear effects, including magnetohydrodynamic interactions influenced by magnetic field orientation, interactions with surrounding material, and complex fluid dynamics associated with young supernova remnants. The localized evolution of this filament, captured with high spatial resolution, provides critical insights into the temporal dynamics of non-thermal particles and the generation of cosmic rays from asymmetric supernova explosions.</p>

<p>2025-10-28, <strong>No Evidence for a Dynamically Evolving Dark Energy Scenario: Tomographic Alcock-Paczyński Test with Redshift-Space Correlation Function II</strong>, Fuyu Dong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24089v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.24089v1</a></p>

<p>We apply an extended Alcock-Paczy'nski (AP) test to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to constrain the dark energy models with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy equation of state. The extended AP test method uses the full shape of redshift-space two-point correlation funcion(CF) as the standard shape in order to measure the expansion history of the universe. We calibrate the standard shape by using the cosmology-dependent nonlinear evolution of the CF shape in the Multiverse simulations. Further validation of the method and calibration of possible systematics are performed based on mock samples from the Horizon Run 4 simulation. Using the AP test alone, we constrain the flat CDM plus CPL-type dark energy model (flat $w^{\rm CPL}$CDM) to have $\Omega_m=0.289_{-0.029}^{+0.031}$, $w_0=-0.798_{-0.102}^{+0.192}$ and $w_a=-0.165_{-0.945}^{+0.610}$. The result does not show evidence for a dynamically evolving dark energy model. When combined with other results from the low-redshift universe, such as the PantheonPlus supernova compilation and DESI BAO data, the constraint on $w_a$ becomes $w_a=-0.124_{-0.368}^{+0.334}$, which is still consistent with zero.</p>
