<p>2024-10-29, <strong>Hypothesis tests and model parameter estimation on data sets with missing correlation information</strong>, Lukas Koch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22333v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.22333v1</a></p>

<p>Ideally, all analyses of normally distributed data should include the full covariance information between all data points. In practice, the full covariance matrix between all data points is not always available. Either because a result was published without a covariance matrix, or because one tries to combine multiple results from separate publications. For simple hypothesis tests, it is possible to define robust test statistics that will behave conservatively in the presence on unknown correlations. For model parameter fits, one can inflate the variance by factor to ensure that things remain conservative at least up to a chosen confidence level. This paper describes a class of robust test statistics for simply hypothesis tests, as well as an algorithm to determine the necessary inflation factor model parameter fits. It then presents some example applications of the methods to real neutrino interaction data and model comparisons.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>Testing tree level TeV scale tyep-I and type-II seesaw scenarios in $μ$TRISTAN</strong>, Arindam Das et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21956v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21956v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate TeV scale type-I and type-II seesaw scenarios at the tree level at the $\mu^+ e^-$ and $\mu^+ \mu^+$ colliders in the $\mu$TRISTAN experiment. In minimal type-I seesaw scenario we consider two generations of Standard Model (SM) singlet heavy Majorana type Right Handed Neutrinos (RHNs) which couples with SM gauge boson through light-heavy neutrino mixing. We consider a minimal scenario where one (other) generation of the RHN dominantly couples with electron (muon). Generating events for the signal and generic SM backgrounds for the final states $e^- \nu jj$ and $\mu^+ \nu jj$ from $\mu^+ e^-$ collision at $\sqrt{s}=346$ GeV and 1 ab$^{-1}$ luminosity, we estimate limits on the light-heavy neutrino mixing angles with respect to heavy neutrino mass for two generations of the heavy neutrinos. Comparing with the existing limits we find such limits could be two orders of magnitude stronger than electroweak precision data. Further, we study the effect of doubly charged scalar boson $(H^{++})$ from the type-II seesaw scenario in $\mu^+ \mu^+$ collision at $\sqrt{s}=2$ TeV. In this case we consider $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to \ell_i^+ \ell_j^+$ and $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to H^{++} Z/ \gamma$ processes followed by the same sign dilepton decay of $H^{++}$. We find that events involving $e^+ e^+$ among these final states could provide significant difference between the normal and inverted orderings of the neutrino mass which could be probed in $\mu$TRISTAN collider at 5$\sigma$ significance in future.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>Rapid cooling of the Cassiopeia A neutron star due to superfluid quantum criticality</strong>, Hao-Fu Zhu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21945v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21945v1</a></p>

<p>The rapid cooling of the neutron star in Cassiopeia A is speculated to arise from an enhanced neutrino emission caused by the onset of $^3P_2$-wave neutron superfluidity in the core. However, the neutrino emissivity due to Cooper-pair breaking and formation is too small to yield the observed cooling rate. Here, we show that such a rapid cooling can be explained once the non-Fermi liquid behavior of the non-superfluid neutron liquid induced by superfluid quantum criticality is included into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling, without assuming the existence of additional energy loss processes. Our results indicate that the neutron star in Cassiopeia A remains in the thermal relaxation stage, which is greatly prolonged by the non-Fermi liquid behavior. The good agreement between our theoretical results and recent observational cooling data points to the pivotal role played by superfluid quantum criticality in neutron stars.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>Redshift-Space Distortion constraints on neutrino mass and models to alleviate the Hubble tension</strong>, Yo Toda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21925v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21925v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the neutrino mass and Hubble tension solutions and examine their effects on the Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) observations. An analysis with RSD data indicates smaller amplitude of perturbation. Including RSD data results in a slightly weaker upper limit on the neutrino mass than that derived for data without RSD, which is common in other extended models too. We have evaluated the impacts of RSD observations on some extended models, including the varying electron mass model, a time-dependent dark energy model with two parameter equations of state (EOS), and a model where the number of neutrino species is free. When we estimate the cosmological parameters for data including RSD, we found that the EOS parameter for dark energy is larger than that of the cosmological constant, and the effective number of neutrino species is smaller than the standard value, which infers a smaller present Hubble parameter $H_0$. From the viewpoint of cosmological tensions, the varying electron mass model with non-zero neutrino mass option looks promising to relax the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension simultaneously.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>Neutrino detection rates from lepto-hadronic model simulations of bright blazar flares</strong>, Joshua Robinson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21881v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21881v1</a></p>

<p>There is mounting evidence that blazars are the sources of part of the very-high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux detected by IceCube. In particular, there have been several spatial and temporal coincidences of individual IceCube neutrino events with flaring blazars, the most prominent of them being IceCube-170922A, coincident with a multi-wavelength flare of TXS~0506+056. Motivated by this, we used the time-dependent lepto-hadronic code OneHaLe to model the spectral energy distributions and light curves of a sample of bright $\gamma$-ray flares of blazars detected by Fermi-LAT, for which Kreter et al. (2020) provided calorimetric estimates of the expected neutrino detection rates. Flares were modelled with temporal changes of the proton injection spectra. Our analysis shows that the calorimetric approach overestimates the increase in neutrino production by a factor of typically $\sim 10$ if the $\gamma$-ray emission is dominated by proton-synchrotron radiation.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>Quantum coherence between mass eigenstates of a neutrino can be destroyed by its mass-momentum entanglement</strong>, Shi-Biao Zheng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21850v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21850v1</a></p>

<p>If a neutrino or antineutrino produced in the decay of an unstable particle is not entangled to its accompanying particles, its mass is necessarily correlated with its momentum. In this note, I illustrate this entanglement would destroy the quantum coherence between the neutrino’s mass eigenstates in both the momentum and position representations, which was overlooked by other authors in previous investigations of entanglement and coherence associated with neutrino oscillations.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>A more novel approach of radiative linear seesaw in a modular $A_4$ symmetry</strong>, Takaaki Nomura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21843v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21843v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a radiatively induced linear seesaw model that is perfectly realized at leading order by a modular $A_4$ symmetry. Because this group also has a flavor symmetry, we obtain some predictions concentrating on two specific regions at nearby fixed points $\tau=\omega$ and $i$. Through our numerical chi square analysis, we show predictions for each the case depending on the neutrino mass ordering; normal and inverted one.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Probing third-generation New Physics with $K\to πν\barν$ and $B\to K^{(*)} ν\barν$</strong>, Lukas Allwicher et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21444v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21444v1</a></p>

<p>The recent observation of the $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu\bar\nu$ decay by NA62 is an important milestone in precision flavor physics. Together with evidence of $B^+ \to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ reported by Belle-II, they are the only FCNC decays involving third-family leptons where a precision close to the SM expectation has been reached. We study the implications of these recent results in the context of a new physics scenario aligned to the third generation, with an approximate $U(2)^5$ flavor symmetry acting on the light families. We find that the slight excess observed in both channels supports the hypothesis of non-standard TeV dynamics of this type, as also hinted at by other $B$-meson decays, consistently with bounds from colliders and electroweak observables. We further discuss how future improvements in precision could affect this picture, highlighting the discovery potential in these di-neutrino modes.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Majorana CP Violation Insights from Decaying Neutrinos</strong>, Sabila Parveen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21428v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21428v1</a></p>

<p>It is well-known that within the standard three flavor neutrino oscillation formalism, the Majorana phases appearing in the neutrino mixing matrix cannot have any effect on neutrino oscillation probabilities thereby evading testability at neutrino oscillation experiments. We consider an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing three flavor neutrino oscillations with the possibility of neutrino decay and demonstrate that the two Majorana phases can entangle with the off-diagonal decay terms and appear at the level of oscillation probabilities. Using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we derive approximate analytical expressions for three flavor neutrino oscillation probabilities in the presence of neutrino decay, taking into account matter effects. In the context of a long baseline neutrino experiment, we then analyse the impact of Majorana phases on the oscillation probabilities for different channels as well as on observables related to CP violation effects in neutrino oscillations. Finally, we discuss the effect of Majorana phases on the parameter degeneracies in the neutrino oscillation framework.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Thermal Gravitational Waves During Reheating</strong>, Nicolás Bernal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21385v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21385v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we revisit the generation of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from interactions in the thermal plasma. We extend the existing literature by incorporating the reheating phase into the thermal history. Our results show that the amplitude of the GW spectrum can be significantly enhanced because the temperature during reheating can be much higher than the reheating temperature. Furthermore, since the temperature evolution during reheating differs from that of free radiation, the peak frequency of the spectrum can also shift. Additionally, the morphology of the spectrum can present characteristic features. We also compute the contribution of the integrated GW spectrum to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, which can be substantially larger.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Testing the Neutrino Content of the Muon at Muon Colliders</strong>, Rodolfo Capdevilla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21383v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21383v1</a></p>

<p>Collinear emission of $W$ bosons off a high-energy muon induces a large muon-neutrino component among the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) of a muon. In this paper we study the phenomenology related to the $\nu_\mu$ PDF at future high-energy muon colliders. We examine total rates and differential distributions of the $e \bar{\nu}_e$ and $W \gamma$ production processes, which receive a large, and often dominant, contribution from this PDF, allowing for a detailed experimental study. We then demonstrate that PDFs can have significant implications for the Higgs precision program envisioned at muon colliders. In particular, our results indicate that neutrino-initiated contributions constitute up to 10% (30%) corrections to the cross section for the production of a single Higgs via $Z$ boson fusion at a 3 TeV (10 TeV) muon collider.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Back to the phase space: thermal axion dark radiation via couplings to standard model fermions</strong>, Francesco D’Eramo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21253v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21253v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the cosmological consequences of axion interactions with standard model fermions accurately and precisely. Our analysis is entirely based on a phase space framework that allows us to keep track of the axion distribution in momentum space across the entire expansion history. First, we consider flavor-diagonal couplings to charged leptons and quantify the expected amount of dark radiation as a function of the coupling strength. Leptophilic axions are immune from complications due to strong interactions and our predictions do not suffer from theoretical uncertainties. We then focus on flavor-diagonal interactions with the three heavier quarks whose masses are all above the scale where strong interactions become non-perturbative. The top quark case is rather safe because its mass is orders of magnitude above the confinement scale, and the consequent predictions are solid. The bottom and charm masses are in more dangerous territory because they are very close to the QCD crossover. We present a comprehensive discussion of theoretical uncertainties due to both the choice of the scale where we stop the Boltzmann evolution and the running of QCD parameters. Finally, we compute the predicted amount of dark radiation expressed as an effective number of additional neutrino species. We compare our predictions with the ones obtained via standard approximate procedures, and we find that adopting a rigorous phase space framework alters the prediction by an amount larger than the sensitivity of future CMB observatories.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Search for excited tau leptons in the $ττγ$ final state in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</strong>, CMS Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21137v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21137v1</a></p>

<p>Results are presented for a test of the compositeness of the heaviest charged lepton, $\tau$, using data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the CERN LHC. The data were collected in 2016-2018 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. This analysis searches for tau lepton pair production in which one of the tau leptons is produced in an excited state and decays to a ground state tau lepton and a photon. The event selection consists of two isolated tau lepton decay candidates and a high-energy photon. The mass of the excited tau lepton is reconstructed using the missing transverse momentum in the event, assuming the momentum of the neutrinos from each tau lepton decay are aligned with the visible decay products. No excess of events above the standard model background prediction is observed. This null result is used to set lower bounds on the excited tau lepton mass. For a compositeness scale $\Lambda$ equal to the excited tau lepton mass, excited tau leptons with masses below 4700 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level; for $\Lambda$ = 10 TeV this exclusion is set at 2800 GeV. This is the first experimental result covering this production and decay process in the excited tau mass range above 175 GeV.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Influence of neutrino-electron scattering and neutrino-pair annihilation on hypermassive neutron star</strong>, Patrick Chi-Kit Cheong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20681v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.20681v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the influence of inelastic neutrino microphysics in general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a hypermassive neutron star. In particular, we include species/energy groups coupled neutrino-matter interactions, such as inelastic neutrino-electron scattering and electron-positron annihilation kernels, into simulations up to 50 ms. Neutrino-electron inelastic scattering is known to have effective neutrino-matter energy exchange. We show that, with neutrino-electron inelastic scattering, simulations predict 75% higher disc mass with slightly different mass-averaged compositions, and 18% more ejected mass with similar distributions. The enhancement of the mass of the disc and the ejecta results in stronger baryon pollution, leading to less favourable jet launching environments. Furthermore, neutrino luminosities are about 50, 40, and 30% higher for electron neutrino, electron anti-neutrino, and heavy-lepton neutrinos. In contrast, we do not see any significant impacts due to electron-positron annihilation.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>Spin Trio: a dark matter scenario</strong>, Mohammad Hossein Rahimi Abkenar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22252v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.22252v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a beyond Standard Model (SM) featuring four new fields. Three fields with different spins - scalar ($ S $), spinor ($ \psi $), and vector ($ V_{\mu} $) - together form the three-component dark matter (DM), while the fourth scalar field ($ \phi $) carries a unit charge under a dark $ U_{D}(1) $ gauge symmetry, enabling SM-DM interactions via the Higgs portal. Although the model maintains classical scale invariance, loop effects break electroweak symmetry. The parameter space is constrained by scale invariance, DM relic density, and direct detection results. Our study aims to identify feasible model regions and evaluate detectability in future experiments. We analyze processes like DM annihilations, semi-annihilations, and conversions, integrating them into Boltzmann equations to calculate DM abundances. Random parameter scans reveal regions compatible with current data, including constraints from direct detection experiments like XENONnT and PandaX-4T . Our results show the model’s viability across a broad range of DM masses.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>Cosmological evolution of dark matter subhaloes under tidal stripping by growing Milky Way-like galaxies</strong>, Yudai Kazuno et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22185v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.22185v1</a></p>

<p>We present the findings of a comprehensive and detailed analysis of merger tree data from ultra-high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations. The analysis, conducted with a particle mass resolution of $5 \times 10^3 h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ and a halo mass resolution of $10^7 h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, provides sufficient accuracy to suppress numerical artefacts. This study elucidates the dynamical evolution of subhaloes associated with the Milky Way-like host haloes. Unlike more massive dark matter haloes, which have been extensively studied, these subhaloes follow a distinct mass evolution pattern: an initial accretion phase, followed by a tidal stripping phase where mass is lost due to the tidal forces of the host halo. The transition from accretion to stripping, where subhaloes reach their maximum mass, occurs around a redshift of $z\simeq1$. Smaller subhaloes reach this point earlier, while larger ones do so later. Our analysis reveals that over 80 per cent of subhaloes have experienced mass loss, underscoring the universality of tidal stripping in subhalo evolution. Additionally, we derived the eccentricities and pericentre distances of subhalo orbits from the simulations and compare them with those of nearby satellite galaxies observed by the Gaia satellite. The results demonstrate a significant alignment between the orbital elements predicted by the cold dark matter model and the observed data, providing robust support for the model as a credible candidate for dark matter.</p>

<p>In direct searches of dark matter, multi-scatter signatures are now being sought to probe scattering cross sections that are large enough to make the detector optically thick to incident particles. We provide some significant updates to the multi-scatter program. Using considerations of energy deposition, we derive the reaches in cross section and mass of various proposed large-volume detectors: a kilotonne fiducial mass “module of opportunity” at DUNE, a kilotonne xenon detector suggested for neutrinoless double beta decay, the gaseous detector CYGNUS, and the dark matter detectors XLZD and Argo. Where the velocity vector can be reconstructed event-by-event, the Galactic dark matter velocity distribution may be inferred. We exploit this to show that halo substructure such as tidal streams can be picked up if they make up about 10% of the local dark matter density.</p>

<p>We investigate the production of dark radiation (DR) from axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) as potential origins of dark matter. Focusing on the dark matter misalignment mechanism, we examine non-thermal, pre-inflationary scenarios that could lead to the generation of DR. A key part of our analysis involves a Bayesian approach to confront ALP parameter space with current cosmological data. Additionally, we explore how DR production could offer solutions to persistent cosmological anomalies, particularly those related to the Hubble constant $H_0$ tension and the $S_8$ parameter discrepancy. Our findings aim to shed new light on the role of ALPs in addressing these open issues in cosmology.</p>

<p>Axion or axion-like particle has been one of the leading candidates for dark matter. Due to its tiny coupling with photon, axion dark matter in the background can induce distinct phase velocities of light with different parity, an effect known as axion-induced birefringence. Here, we propose a modification to the polarization state of the inter-spacecraft laser link in LISA-like interferometers in space to make them sensitive to this birefringence effect. We discuss the prospects of using Sagnac combinations to search for axion dark matter and derive the corresponding sensitivity. With this setup, we show that next-generation laser interferometers in space would have great sensitivities on the axion-photon coupling with axion mass around $10^{-19}~\text{eV}\sim 10^{-14}~\text{eV}$.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>Invisible Higgs decay from dark matter freeze-in at stronger coupling</strong>, Oleg Lebedev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21874v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21874v1</a></p>

<p>We study the Higgs boson decay into dark matter (DM) in the framework of freeze-in at stronger coupling. Even though the Higgs-DM coupling is significant, up to order one, DM does not thermalize due to the Boltzmann suppression of its production at low temperatures. We find that this mechanism leads to observable Higgs decay into invisible final states with the branching fraction of 10% and below, while producing the correct DM relic abundance. This applies to the DM masses down to the MeV scale, which requires a careful treatment of the hadronic production modes. For DM masses below the muon threshold, the Boltzmann suppression is not operative and the freeze-in nature of the production mechanism is instead guaranteed by the smallness of the electron Yukawa coupling. As a result, MeV DM with a significant coupling to the Higgs boson remains non-thermal as long as the reheating temperature does not exceed $\mathcal{O}(100)\;$MeV. Our findings indicate that there are good prospects for observing light non-thermal DM via invisible Higgs decay at the LHC and FCC.</p>

<p>We study two types of models involving a scalar dark matter multiplet of global $O(N)$ symmetry. These models are distinguished by the absence (Type I) or presence (Type II) of a scalar mediator with $Z_{2}$ symmetry. We derive the allowed regions for the dark matter mass and new scalar couplings based on constraints from Higgs invisible decay, the relic abundance of dark matter, and the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section. Within the allowed parameter space, we also discuss the vacuum stability of the Higgs potential and the perturbativity of the scalar couplings in both models. We find that the Type I model cannot achieve stable electroweak vacuum, whereas the Type II model can have both a stable vacuum and perturbative couplings up to the Planck scale.</p>

<p>We present a novel experimental approach to detect dark matter by probing Yukawa interactions, commonly referred to as a fifth force, between dark matter and baryonic matter. Our method involves optically levitating nanoparticles within a Bessel-Gaussian beam to detect minute forces exerted by potential dark matter interaction with test masses. The non-diffracting properties of Bessel-Gaussian beams, combined with feedback cooling techniques, provide exceptional sensitivity to small perturbations in the motion of the nanoparticles. This setup allows for precise control over trapping conditions and enhances the detection sensitivity to forces on the order of (10^{-18}) N. We explore the parameter space of the Yukawa interaction, focusing on the coupling strength ((\alpha)) and interaction range ((\lambda)), and discuss the potential of this experiment to place new constraints on dark matter couplings, complementing existing direct detection methods.</p>

<p>It is commonly assumed that low-mass primordial black holes cannot constitute a significant fraction of the dark matter in our universe due to their predicted short lifetimes from the conventional Hawking radiation and evaporation process. Assuming physical black holes are nonsingular–likely due to quantum gravity or other high-energy physics–we demonstrate that a large class of nonsingular black holes have finite evaporation temperatures. This can lead to slowly evaporating low-mass black holes or to remnant mass states that circumvent traditional evaporation constraints. As a proof of concept, we explore the limiting curvature hypothesis and the evaporation process of a nonsingular black hole solution in two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We identify generic features of the radiation profile and compare them with known regular black holes, such as the Bardeen solution in four dimensions. Remnant masses are proportional to the fundamental length scale, and we argue that slowly evaporating low-mass nonsingular black holes, or remnants, are viable dark matter candidates.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Towards alleviating the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions with Early Dark Energy - Dark Matter drag</strong>, Théo Simon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21459v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21459v1</a></p>

<p>Early dark energy, an additional component of dark energy active in the decade of redshift before recombination, has emerged as one of the most effective models at reducing the $H_0$ tension between direct measurement of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ in the late-universe and the $\Lambda$CDM prediction when calibrated on Planck. However, it requires a slight increase in the dark matter density $\omega_{\rm cdm}$ and primordial tilt $n_s$ that worsens the $S_8$ tension between measurements of weak gravitational lensing at low redshifts and the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM prediction. Using a phenomenological fluid model, we investigate whether the inclusion of a drag term between dark matter and early dark energy can compensate for the effect of the increase in power at small-scales, such that both $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are simultaneously alleviated. We find that this works if the drag term is dynamically relevant in the post-recombination universe. However, a drag term active before or just around the time at which the early dark energy contribution to the energy density is maximum is significantly constrained due to its impact on the matter perturbations before recombination, and the subsequent modifications to the cosmic microwave background power spectra.</p>

<p>We investigate the effect of primordial non-Gaussianities on halo number counts using N-body simulations with different values of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. We show how current theoretical models fail to adequately describe the non-Gaussian mass function of halos identified with different overdensity thresholds, $\Delta_{\rm b}$. We explain how these discrepancies are related to a variation in the density profile of dark matter halos, finding that the internal steepness (i.e. the compactness) of halos depends on the value of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. We then parametrize these deviations in halo number counts with a factor $\kappa(\Delta_{\rm b})$ that modifies the linear density threshold for collapse according to the halo identification threshold used, defined with respect to the Universe background density. We rely on a second-degree polynomial to describe $\kappa$ and employ a Bayesian analysis to determine the coefficients of this polynomial. In addition, we verify the independence of the latter on the sign and absolute value of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. Finally, we show how this re-parametrization prevents the extraction of biased constraints on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, correcting for large systematic errors especially in the case of halos identified with high density thresholds. This improvement is crucial in the perspective of deriving cosmological constraints with the non-Gaussian mass function from real data, as different mass definitions can be employed depending on the properties of the survey.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>A Survey of Dynamical and Gravitational Lensing Tests in Scale Invariance: The Fall of Dark Matter?</strong>, Andre Maeder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21379v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21379v1</a></p>

<p>We first briefly review the adventure of scale invariance in physics, from Galileo Galilei, Weyl, Einstein, and Feynman to the revival by Dirac (1973) and Canuto et al. (1977). We then gather concrete observational evidence that scale-invariant effects are present and measurable in astronomical objects spanning a vast range of masses (0.5 M$_{\odot} &lt;$ M $&lt; 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) and an equally impressive range of spatial scales (0.01 pc $&lt;$ r $&lt;$ 1 Gpc). Scale invariance accounts for the observed excess in velocity in galaxy clusters with respect to the visible mass, the relatively flat/small slope of rotation curves in local galaxies, the observed steep rotation curves of high-redshift galaxies, and the excess of velocity in wide binary stars with separations above 3000 kau found in Gaia DR3. Last but not least, we investigate the effect of scale invariance on gravitational lensing. We show that scale invariance does not affect the geodesics of light rays as they pass in the vicinity of a massive galaxy. However, scale-invariant effects do change the inferred mass-to-light ratio of lens galaxies as compared to GR. As a result, the discrepancies seen in GR between the total lensing mass of galaxies and their stellar mass from photometry may be accounted for. This holds true both for lenses at high redshift like JWST-ER1 and at low redshift like in the SLACS sample. Of note is that none of the above observational tests require dark matter or any adjustable parameter to tweak the theory at any given mass or spatial scale.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Model-agnostic basis functions for the 2-point correlation function of dark matter in linear theory</strong>, Aseem Paranjape et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21374v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21374v1</a></p>

<p>We consider approximating the linearly evolved 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of dark matter $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})$ in a cosmological model with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ as the linear combination $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx\sum_i\,b_i(r)\,w_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, where the functions $\mathcal{B}={b_i(r)}$ form a $\textit{model-agnostic basis}$ for the linear 2pcf. This decomposition is important for model-agnostic analyses of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the nonlinear 2pcf of galaxies that fix $\mathcal{B}$ and leave the coefficients ${w_i}$ free. To date, such analyses have made simple but sub-optimal choices for $\mathcal{B}$, such as monomials. We develop a machine learning framework for systematically discovering a $\textit{minimal}$ basis $\mathcal{B}$ that describes $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ near the BAO feature in a wide class of cosmological models. We use a custom architecture, denoted $\texttt{BiSequential}$, for a neural network (NN) that explicitly realizes the separation between $r$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ above. The optimal NN trained on data in which only ${\Omega_{\rm m},h}$ are varied in a $\textit{flat}$ $\Lambda$CDM model produces a basis $\mathcal{B}$ comprising $9$ functions capable of describing $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ to $\sim0.6\%$ accuracy in $\textit{curved}$ $w$CDM models varying 7 parameters within $\sim5\%$ of their fiducial, flat $\Lambda$CDM values. Scales such as the peak, linear point and zero-crossing of $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ are also recovered with very high accuracy. We compare our approach to other compression schemes in the literature, and speculate that $\mathcal{B}$ may also encompass $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ in modified gravity models near our fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model. Using our basis functions in model-agnostic BAO analyses can potentially lead to significant statistical gains.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Dynamical Axion Misalignment from the Witten Effect</strong>, Abhishek Banerjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21369v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21369v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a relaxation mechanism for the initial misalignment angle of the pre-inflationary QCD axion with a large decay constant. The proposal addresses the challenges posed to the axion dark matter scenario by an overabundance of axions overclosing the Universe, as well as by isocurvature constraints. Many state-of-the-art experiments are searching for QCD axion dark matter with a decay constant as large as $10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, motivating the need for a theoretical framework such as ours. In our model, hidden sector magnetic monopoles generated in the early Universe give the axion a large mass via the Witten effect, causing early oscillations that reduce the misalignment angle and axion abundance. As the hidden gauge symmetry breaks, its monopoles confine via cosmic strings, dissipating energy into the Standard Model and leading to monopole-antimonopole annihilation. This removes the monopole-induced mass, leaving only the standard QCD term. We consider the symmetry breaking pattern of $\mathrm{SU}(2)’ \to \mathrm{U}(1)’ \to 1$, leading to monopole and string formation respectively. We calculate the monopole abundance, their interactions with the axion field, and the necessary conditions for monopole-induced axion oscillations, while accounting for UV instanton effects. We present three model variations based on different symmetry breaking scales and show that they can accommodate an axion decay constant of up to $10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ with an inflationary scale of $10^{15}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. The required alignment between monopole-induced and QCD axion potentials is achieved through a modest Nelson-Barr mechanism, avoiding overclosure without anthropic reasoning.</p>

<p>Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxy clusters plays a key role in regulating star formation and shaping the intracluster medium (ICM), often manifesting through prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the cluster’s hot atmosphere. Here we show that X-ray cavities arise naturally due to AGN feedback in TNG-Cluster. This is a new suite of magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, and hence of galaxy clusters, whereby cold dark matter, baryon dynamics, galactic astrophysics, and magnetic fields are evolved together consistently. We construct mock Chandra X-ray observations of the central regions of the 352 simulated clusters at $z=0$ and find that $\sim$39 per cent contain X-ray cavities. Identified X-ray cavities vary in configuration (single, pairs, or multiples), with some still attached to SMBHs, while others have buoyantly risen. Their size ranges from a few to several tens of kpc. In terms of gas physical properties, TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities are underdense compared to the surrounding halo and filled with hot gas ($\sim$10$^8$K); 25 per cent of them are surrounded by an X-ray bright and compressed rim associated with a weak shock (Mach number $\sim 1.5$). Clusters exhibiting X-ray cavities are preferentially strong or weak cool-cores, are dynamically relaxed, and host SMBHs accreting at low Eddington rates. We show that TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities originate from episodic, wind-like energy injections from central AGN. Our results illustrate the existence and diversity of X-ray cavities simulated in state-of-the-art models within realistic cosmological environments and show that these can form without necessarily invoking bipolar, collimated, or relativistic jets.</p>

<p>Optical observations of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs) show they typically have high specific star formation rates and low metallicites. A subset of these galaxies (those with the lowest gas phase metallicities) display cometary optical morphologies similar to those found at high redshift. Whether this combination of properties predominantly arises from interactions with neighbours or accretion from the cosmic web or something else remains unclear. We used high resolution HI mapping to gain insights into the processes driving the observed properties of a sample of extremely metal poor (XMP) BCDs. We present Very Large Array B- and C-configuration HI mapping of four BCDs. For three of the targeted BCDs we also detect and map the HI in their nearby companions. In these three cases there is HI evidence for a recent flyby interaction between the BCD and a nearby companion. The HI evidence for recent interactions for these three BCDs is corroborated by our analysis of the tidal forces exerted on the BCDs by companions with available spectroscopic redshifts. For J0204-1009 we had sufficient spatial resolution to determine that it is dark matter dominated and estimate its DM halo mass to be in the range 1.2 x 10^11 to 5.2 x 10^11 solar masses. It is the most isolated BCD in our small sample, J0301-0052, which shows one of the most asymmetric HI morphologies. J0301-0052 has a similar cometary HI morphology to the BCD’s optical morphology, although the HI column density maximum is projected at the end of the of the optical tail. Our HI observations suggest J0301-0052 may be undergoing a merger, while the other BCDs show evidence of a recent tidal interaction with a near neighbour. While our selection criteria favoured BCDs with companions our results are consistent with the earlier finding by other authors that most BCDs are associated with either mild tidal interactions or mergers.</p>

<p>Stellar streams retain a memory of their gravitational interactions with small-scale perturbations. While perturbative models for streams have been formulated in action-angle coordinates, a direct transformation to these coordinates is only available for static and typically axisymmetric models for the galaxy. The real Milky Way potential is in a state of disequilibrium, complicating the application of perturbative methods around an equilibrium system. Here, we utilize a combination of differentiable simulations and Hamiltonian perturbation theory to model the leading-order effect of dark matter subhalos on stream observables. To obtain a perturbative description of streams, we develop a direct and efficient forward mode differentiation of Hamilton’s equations of motion. Our model operates in observable coordinates, allowing us to treat the effects of arbitrary subhalo potentials on streams perturbatively, while simultaneously capturing non-linear effects due to other substructures like the infalling LMC or the rotating bar. The model predicts the velocity dispersion of streams as a function of subhalo statistics, allowing us to constrain the low-mass range of subhalos down to $\sim 10^5~M_\odot$. We forecast the velocity dispersion of the GD-1 stream, and find that observations are in agreement with a CDM subhalo population, with a slight preference for more dense subhalos. The method provides a new approach to characterize streams in the presence of substructure, with significantly more modeling flexibility compared to previous works.</p>

<p>The singlet scalar dark matter (DM) model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM). This model features only two free parameters: the singlet scalar mass $m_S$ and the quartic coupling $a_2$ between the singlet scalar and the SM Higgs doublet. Previous studies have suggested that only the resonant region remains viable under combined constraints. In this work, we revisit and refine the constraints using data from the direct detection experiment LZ, invisible Higgs decay measurements, and gamma-ray line observations conducted by Fermi-LAT and DAMPE. Our findings indicate that the latest results from LZ have significantly strengthened the constraints on the model parameters. We demonstrate that only a narrow parameter region remains viable, specifically $60.5\,\text{GeV}&lt; m_S &lt; 62.5\,\text{GeV}$ and $1.7\times10^{-4}&lt;a_2&lt; 4.7\times10^{-4}$. This suggests that a three-fold improvement in the current LZ results would thoroughly examine the parameter space below $1\,\rm{TeV}$ for the singlet scalar DM model.</p>

<p>The DarkSide-50 (DS-50) experiment aims at the direct detection of weakly interacting massive particles. It is a dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber (LAr TPC) where Dark Matter (DM), which constitutes five sixths of all matter in the universe, is expected to interact with an argon nucleus resulting in a nuclear recoil. A scintillation signal (S1) is produced as a result of the ionising events from the DM-Ar interaction. The impurities in LAr, such as $\text{O}_2, \text{N}_2, \text{H}_2\text{O}$, etc., at the ppm level, quench the scintillation photons, leading to a reduction in the observed lifetime of the triplet state. In this contribution, the effect of impurities on the triplet lifetime is analyzed for individual events using DS-50 data, with a primary focus on nitrogen, one of the candidates for the impurities in LAr hypothesized to cause a suppression of triplet lifetime. This is done by determining the lifetime of the triplet component with a known purity, which can be used as a reference for the purity level of argon used in current and future dark matter searches.</p>

Jyothilakshmi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20923v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.20923v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the behaviour of the prominent non-radial fundamental $f$-mode oscillations of dark matter (DM) admixed strange quark stars (DMSQSs), by adopting an equation of state (EoS) developed in Ref.~\cite{Sen:2022pfr}, which considers the possible presence of feebly interacting DM in strange quark stars (SQSs) for the first time. Within the model, feeble interaction between fermionic DM $\chi$ and strange quark matter (SQM) is invoked via a vector new physics mediator $\xi$ with coupling strength $y_{\xi}$. The pure SQM is described by the vector MIT Bag model. By varying different EoS parameters, the structural properties viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) of the DMSQSs are studied with respect to various astrophysical constraints. We study in detail the $f$-mode spectra within the Cowling approximation by obtaining the frequencies as a function of mass, compactness and $\Lambda$ of the star. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of DMSQSs. Our investigation indicates that the presence of DM and its interaction with SQM has great impact on the $f$-modes. We show that the $f$-mode frequencies are larger for DMSQSs, which are largely populated with massive DM fermions, compared to the SQSs. Further, we obtain a linear empirical relation between the $f$-modes and the average density of the star. We also find that the mass-scaled angular frequency varies universally with compactness for DMSQSs.</p>

<p>In this article, we propose a new way to handle interactions between two scalar fields in the cosmological backdrop where one scalar field oscillates rapidly in the cosmological time scale while the other does not show any periodic behavior in the same time scale. We have interpreted the rapidly oscillating scalar field as the dark matter candidate while the other scalar field is supposed to be the canonical quintessence field or the non-canonical phantom field. A model of a generalized top-hat-like collapse is developed where the dark sector is composed of the aforementioned scalar fields. We show how the non-minimal coupling in the dark sector affects the gravitational collapse of a slightly overdense spherical patch of the universe. The results show that one can have both unclustered and clustered dark energy in such collapses, the result depends upon the magnitude of the non-minimal coupling strength.</p>

<p>Gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar binary black hole (sBBH) mergers can be strongly gravitational lensed by intervening galaxies/galaxy clusters. Only a few works investigated the cluster-lensed sBBH mergers by adopting oversimplified models, while galaxy-lensed ones were intensively studied. In this paper, we estimate the detection rate of cluuster-lensed sBBH mergers with the third-generation GW detectors and its dependence on the lens models. We adopt detailed modeling of galaxy cluster lenses by using the mock clusters in the Synthetic Sky Catalog for Dark Energy Science with LSST (CosmoDC2) and/or approximations of the pseudo-Jaffe profile or an eccentric Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo plus a bright central galaxy with singular isothermal sphere profile. Considering the formation of sBBH mergers dominates by the channel of evolution of massive binary stars (EMBS), we find that the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBHs is $\sim5-84$ yr$^{-1}$, depending on the adopted lens model and uncertainty in the merger rate density, and it is about $\sim{13_{-2.0}^{+28}}$yr$^{-1}$ if adopting relatively more realistic galaxy clusters with central main and member galaxies in the CosmoDC2 catalog, close to the estimated detection rate of sBBH mergers lensed by galaxies. In addition, we also consider the case that the production of sBBH mergers dominated by the dynamical interactions in dense stellar systems. We find that the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBHs if from the dynamical channel is about $1.5$ times larger than that from the EMBS channel and the redshift distribution of former peaking at a higher redshift ($\sim3$) compared with that from latter ($\sim2$).</p>

<p>Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can address the small-scale anomalies and previous researches focused on such a SIDM heavier than GeV, for which the self-scattering cross-section is in the quantum resonance region and has a non-trivial velocity dependence. For a SIDM lighter than GeV, the self-scattering cross-section falls within the Born region. In this work, considering the constraints from CMB, BBN and the DM relic density, we investigate the direct detection of the Higgs portal for a sub-GeV SIDM with a scalar mediator. For this end, we consider two approaches : one is the cosmic-ray accelerated dark matter (CRDM) scattering off the nucleon, the other is the electron recoil caused by the halo dark matter. We present direct detection limits for the parameter space of light SIDM and scalar mediator. We find that the detectability in either approach needs a sizable mediator-Higgs mixing angle ($\sin\theta$) which is larger than one for the CRDM approach and larger than $10^{-3}$ for the electron recoil approach. While the former case cannot be realized in the Higgs-portal light SIDM model with a scalar mediator, the latter case may also be constrained by some astrophysical observations or beam dump experiment. Anyway, even if other constraints are quite stringent, the direct detection may provide independent limits for such a sub-GeV SIDM.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>Non-LTE Synthetic Observables of a Multidimensional Model of Type Ia Supernovae</strong>, Samuel J. Boos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22276v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.22276v1</a></p>

<p>Many promising explosion models for the elusive origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ultimately fail to completely reproduce a number of observed properties of these events. One limiting factor for many of these models is the use of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption in the calculation of their synthetic observables, which has been shown to prevent the accurate prediction of a number of fundamental features of SNe Ia. The inclusion of high-accuracy non-LTE physics, however, increases computational cost and complexity such that multidimensional non-LTE calculations are often unfeasible, which can be problematic for models that are inherently multidimensional. In this work, we conduct radiative transfer calculations using 1D profiles that each correspond with a line of sight from an asymmetric, 2D SN Ia model. We find, in LTE, that the synthetic observables from these calculations efficiently reproduce those from the 2D calculation when an equivalence of bolometric luminosities between the 1D and 2D treatments is enforced. This allows for the accurate calculation of synthetic observables in 1D while still preserving multidimensional effects associated with the model. We leverage this to produce high accuracy observables from 1D non-LTE calculations, showing significantly improved agreement with observation, including a roughly 50% reduction of $B$-band decline rate into congruence with the observed Phillips relation. Additionally, our non-LTE observables show Si II $\lambda$5972 pEWs that are much more similar to observation, while spanning multiple Branch classes, suggesting that some spectral classifications of SNe Ia arise from line of sight effects.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>On the Ubiquity of Extreme Baryon Concentrations in the Early Universe</strong>, Alvio Renzini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22138v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.22138v1</a></p>

<p>Early JWST observations have revealed the ubiquitous presence in the early Universe, up to z about16, of extreme baryon concentrations, namely forming globular clusters, extremely dense galaxies that may or may not be UV bright, and supermassive black holes in relatively low-mass galaxies. This paper is trying to pinpoint which physical conditions may have favored the formation of such concentrations, that appear to be very common at high redshifts while their formation being progressively more and more rare at lower redshifts. Building on local globular cluster evidence, it is argued that such conditions can consist in a combination of a 10 Myr extended feedback free time, coupled to low angular-momentum densities in deep local minima of the ISM vorticity field, where baryon concentrations are more likely to form. It is argued that the former condition would follow from more massive stars failing to explode as supernovae, and the latter one from low vorticity prevailing in the early Universe, in contrast to later times with their secular increase of the angular momentum density due to the cumulative effect of tidal interactions.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>SN 1885A and supernova remnants in the centre of M31 with LOFAR</strong>, Deepika Venkattu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22073v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.22073v1</a></p>

<p>We present the first LOFAR image of the centre of M31 at a frequency of 150 MHz. We clearly detect three supernova remnants, which, along with archival VLA data at 3 GHz and other published radio and X-ray data allows us to characterize them in detail. Our observations also allow us to obtain upper limits the historical SN 1885A which is undetected even at a low frequency of 150 MHz. From analytical modelling we find that SN 1885A will stay in its free-expansion phase for at least another couple of centuries. We find an upper limit of $n_{\rm H}~\lesssim 0.04$ cm$^{-3}$ for the interstellar medium of SN 1885A, and that the SN ejecta density is not shallower than $\propto r^{-9}$ (on average). From the $2.6\sigma$ tentative detection in X-ray, our analysis shows that non-thermal emission is expected to dominate the SN 1885A emission. Comparing our results with those on G1.9+0.3, we find that it is likely that the asymmetries in G1.9+0.3 make it a more efficient radio and X-ray emitter than SN 1885A. For Braun 80, 95 and 101, the other remnants in this region, we estimate ages of 5200, 8100, and 13,100 years, and shock speeds of 1150, 880, and 660 km s$^{-1}$}, respectively. Based on this, the supernova rate in the central 0.5 kpc $\times$ 0.6 kpc of M31 is at least one per $\sim 3000~{\rm yr}$. We estimate radio spectral indices of $-0.66\pm0.05$, $-0.37\pm0.03$ and $-0.50\pm0.03$ for the remnants, respectively, which match fairly well with previous studies.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>Impact of cosmology dependence of baryonic feedback in weak lensing</strong>, Pranjal R. S. et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21980v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21980v1</a></p>

<p>Robust modeling of non-linear scales is critical for accurate cosmological inference in Stage IV surveys. For weak lensing analyses in particular, a key challenge arises from the incomplete understanding of how non-gravitational processes, such as supernovae and active galactic nuclei - collectively known as baryonic feedback - affect the matter distribution. Several existing methods for modeling baryonic feedback treat it independently from the underlying cosmology, an assumption which has been found to be inaccurate by hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we examine the impact of this coupling between baryonic feedback and cosmology on parameter inference at LSST Y1 precision. We build mock 3$\times$2pt data vectors using the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which span a wide range of cosmologies while keeping subgrid parameters fixed. We perform simulated likelihood analyses for two baryon mitigation techniques: (i) the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method which identifies eigenmodes for capturing the effect baryonic feedback on the data vector and (ii) HMCode2020 (Mead et al. 2021) which analytically models the modification in the matter distribution using a halo model approach. Our results show that the PCA method is robust to the coupling between cosmology and baryonic feedback, whereas, when using HMCode2020 there can be up to $0.5\sigma$ bias in $\Omega_\text{m}$-$S_8$. For HMCode2020, the bias also correlates with the input cosmology while for PCA we find no such correlation.</p>

<p>2024-10-29, <strong>The Proper Motion of the High Galactic Latitude Pulsar Calvera</strong>, Michela Rigoselli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21828v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21828v1</a></p>

<p>Calvera (1RXS J141256.0+792204) is a pulsar of characteristic age 285 kyr at a high Galactic latitude of b=+37{\deg}, detected only in soft thermal X-rays. We measure a new and precise proper motion for Calvera using Chandra HRC-I observations obtained 10 years apart. We also derive a new phase-connected ephemeris using 6 years of NICER data, including the astrometric position and proper motion as fixed parameters in the timing solution. Calvera is located near the center of a faint, circular radio ring that was recently discovered by LOFAR and confirmed as a supernova remnant (SNR) by the detection of gamma-ray emission with Fermi/LAT. The proper motion of $78.5 \pm 2.9$ mas/yr at position angle $241{\deg}.3 \pm 2{\deg}.2$ (in Galactic coordinates) points away from the center of the ring, a result which differs markedly from a previous low-significance measurement, and greatly simplifies the interpretation of the SNR/pulsar association. It argues that the supernova indeed birthed Calvera &lt;10 kyr ago, with an initial spin period close to its present value of 59 ms. The tangential velocity of the pulsar depends on its uncertain distance, $v_t=(372 \pm 14) d_{1 kpc}$ km/s, but is probably dominated by the supernova kick, while its progenitor could have been a runaway O or B star from the Galactic disk.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Non-parametric reconstruction of the fine structure constant with galaxy clusters</strong>, Marcelo Ferreira et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21542v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21542v1</a></p>

<p>Testing possible variations in fundamental constants of nature is a crucial endeavor in observational cosmology. This paper investigates potential cosmological variations in the fine structure constant ($\alpha$) through a non-parametric approach, using galaxy cluster observations as the primary cosmological probe. We employ two methodologies based on galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements derived from X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich observations, along with luminosity distances from type Ia supernovae. We also explore how different values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) impact the variation of $\alpha$ across cosmic history. When using the Planck satellite’s $H_0$ observations, a constant $\alpha$ is ruled out at approximately the 3$\sigma$ confidence level for $z \lesssim 0.5$. Conversely, employing local estimates of $H_0$ restores agreement with a constant $\alpha$.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Bow Shock and Local Bubble Plasma Unveiled by the Scintillating Millisecond Pulsar J0437$-$4715</strong>, Daniel J. Reardon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21390v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21390v1</a></p>

<p>The interstellar medium of the Milky Way contains turbulent plasma with structures driven by energetic processes that fuel star formation and shape the evolution of our Galaxy. Radio waves from pulsars are scattered off the small (au-scale and below) structures, resulting in frequency-dependent interference patterns that are modulated in time because of the relative motions of the pulsar, Earth, and plasma. Power spectral analyses of these patterns show parabolic arcs with curvatures that encode the locations and kinematics of individual structures. Here we report the discovery of at least 25 distinct plasma structures in the direction of the brilliant millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437$-$4715, in observations obtained with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Four arcs reveal structures within 5000 au of the pulsar, from a series of shocks induced as the pulsar and its wind interact with the ambient insterstellar medium. The measured radial distance and velocity of the main shock allows us to solve the shock geometry and space velocity of the pulsar in three dimensions, while the velocity of another structure unexpectedly indicates a back flow from the direction of the shock or pulsar-wind tail. The remaining 21 arcs represent a surprising abundance of structures sustained by turbulence within the Local Bubble – a region of the interstellar medium thought to be depleted of gas by a series of supernova explosions about 14 Myr ago.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Unveiling the nature of SN 2022jli: the first double-peaked stripped-envelope supernova showing periodic undulations and dust emission at late times</strong>, Régis Cartier et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21381v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21381v1</a></p>

<p>We present optical and IR observations from maximum light until around 600 d of SN 2022jli, a peculiar SE SN showing two maxima, each one with a peak luminosity of about 3 x 10^{42} erg/s and separated by 50 d. The second maximum is followed by periodic undulations with a period of P ~ 12.5 days. The spectra and the photometric evolution of the first maximum are consistent with the behaviour of a standard SE SN with an ejecta mass of 1.5 +/- 0.4 Msun, and a nickel mass of 0.12 +/- 0.01 Msun. The optical spectra after 400 d correspond to a standard SN Ic event, and at late times SN 2022jli exhibits a significant drop in the optical luminosity implying that the physical phenomena that produced the secondary maximum has ceased to power the SN light curve. One possibility is that the second maximum is powered by a magnetar with an initial spin period of P=48.5 ms and a magnetic field of B = 8.5x10^{14} G, while the light curve periodic undulations could be produced by accretion of material from a companion star onto the neutron star in a binary system. The near-IR spectra shows clear 1st CO overtone emission from about 190 d after the first maximum, and it becomes undetected at 400 d. A significant near-IR excess from hot dust emission is detected at 238 d produced by either newly formed dust in the SN ejecta or due to a strong near-IR dust echo. Depending on the assumptions of the dust composition, the estimated dust mass is 2-16 x 10^{-4} Msun. The magnetar power of the second maximum can fit in a more general picture where magnetars are the power source of super-luminous SNe, could produce their frequent bumps and undulations, and where pulsars could produce the late time excess observed in some SE SNe. The detection of CO and the potential detection of dust formed in the ejecta of SN2022jli are important to understand the formation molecules and dust in the ejecta of SE SNe.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Semi-confined supernova feedback in HII region bubbles</strong>, Cheryl S. C. Lau et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21255v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21255v1</a></p>

<p>Galactic-scale simulations rely on sub-grid models to provide prescriptions for the coupling between supernova (SN) feedback and the interstellar medium (ISM). Many of these models are computed in 1-D to allow for an efficient way to account for the variability of properties of their local environment. However, small-scale simulations revealed that the release of energy from SNe within molecular clouds can be highly asymmetrical. This is largely due to the presence of pre-SN feedback, such as ionizing radiation, that are able to carve cavities and channels around the progenitors prior to their detonation. Being partially confined, the SN energy escapes into the outer ISM preferentially through these channels, departing from the spherically symmetric 1-D descriptions. To understand by how much the feedback output could differ, we present a theoretical model for a semi-confined SN. The problem concerns a SN expanding into an evolved HII region, bounded by a molecular cloud with pre-existing vents. With the aid of simple 3-D hydrodynamical simulations, we show that this mode of energy release increases the dynamical impact of the outflows, and extends the timescales over which the SN is energetically coupled to the surrounding matter. We also show that the amount of small-scale solenoidal turbulence driven by semi-confined SNe may be amplified.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Cosmological tests of quintessence in quantum gravity</strong>, Sukannya Bhattacharya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21243v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21243v1</a></p>

<p>We use a suite of the most recent cosmological observations to test models of dynamical dark energy motivated by quantum gravity. Specifically, we focus on hilltop quintessence scenarios, able to satisfy theoretical constraints from quantum gravity. We discuss their realisation based on axions, their supersymmetric partners, and Higgs-like string constructions. We also examine a specific parameterisation for dynamical dark energy suitable for hilltop quintessence. We then perform an analysis based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo to assess their predictions against CMB, galaxy surveys, and supernova data. We show to what extent current data can distinguish amongst different hilltop set-ups, providing model parameter constraints that are complementary to and synergetic with theoretical bounds from quantum gravity conjectures, as well as model comparisons across the main dark energy candidates in the literature. However, all these constraints are sensitive to priors based on theoretical assumptions about viable regions of parameter space. Consequently, we discuss theoretical challenges in refining these priors, with the aim of maximizing the informative power of current and forthcoming cosmological datasets for testing dark energy scenarios in quantum gravity.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory sensitivity to heavy Galactic Cosmic Rays and the shape of particle spectrum</strong>, Coline Dubos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21199v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.21199v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and the potential role of Supernova Remnants (SNRs) as cosmic-ray (CR) accelerators remain subjects of ongoing debate. To shed more light on this topic, we have studied the spectral shape of two SNRs, RX J1713.7-3946 and HAWC J2227+610, performing simulations for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). The previous multi-wavelength (MWL) analysis on these two sources showed an important hadronic contribution at high energies. The interaction of the GCRs accelerated by the SNRs with the medium around the accelerator leads to a process of pion decay (PD) that produces gamma-rays ($\gamma$-rays). These emissions, detectable by CTAO, offer an indirect means of pinpointing the CR source. Two scenarios have been considered: the contribution of heavy CRs and different cut-off sharpnesses ($\beta$) of the particle spectra. The simulations were performed by using different CR composition distributions (protons, CNO, Fe) and different sharpness values ranging from $\beta$=0.5 to $\beta$=1.5. The results show that, in the cases studied here, CTAO will increase the sensitivity to the spectral shape of $\gamma$-rays. This allows us to distinguish protons from heavy CRs and obtain information on $\beta$ values and therefore on different acceleration scenarios.</p>

<p>The advent of large astronomical surveys has made available large and complex data sets. However, the process of discovery and interpretation of each potentially new astronomical source is, many times, still handcrafted. In this context, machine learning algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool to mine large data sets and lower the burden on the domain expert. Active learning strategies are specially good in this task. In this report, we used the PineForest algorithm to search for superluminous supernova (SLSN) candidates in the Zwicky Transient Facility. We showcase how the use of previously confirmed sources can provide important information to boost the convergence of the active learning algorithm. Starting from a data set of $\sim$14 million objects, and using 8 previously confirmed SLSN light curves as priors, we scrutinized 120 candidates and found 8 SLSN candidates, 2 of which have not been reported before (AT 2018moa and AT 2018mob). These results demonstrate how existing spectroscopic samples can be used to improve the efficiency of active learning strategies in searching for rare astronomical sources.</p>

<p>2024-10-28, <strong>Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra for the Photospheric Phase of a 3D Stripped-Envelope Supernova Explosion Model</strong>, Thomas Maunder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20829v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.20829v1</a></p>

<p>We present synthetic light curves and spectra from three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations based on a 3D core-collapse supernova explosion model of an ultra-stripped $3.5\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ progenitor. Our calculations predict a fast and faint transient with $\Delta m_{15} \sim 1\texttt{-} 2\,\mathrm{mag}$ and peak bolometric luminosity between $-15.3\,\mathrm{mag}$ and $-16.4\,\mathrm{mag}$. Due to a large-scale unipolar asymmetry in the distribution of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, there is a pronounced viewing-angle dependence with about $1\,\mathrm{mag}$ difference between the directions of highest and lowest luminosity. The predicted spectra for this rare class of explosions do not yet match any observed counterpart. They are dominated by prominent Mg~II lines, but features from O, C, Si, and Ca are also found. In particular, the O~I line at \wl{7}{774} appears as a blended feature together with Mg~II emission. Our model is not only faster and fainter than the observed Ib/c supernova population, but also shows a correlation between higher peak luminosity and larger $\Delta m_{15}$ that is not present in observational samples. A possible explanation is that the unusually small ejecta mass of our model accentuates the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry. We suggest that the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry may be used to constrain asymmetries in explosion models of more typical stripped-envelope supernova progenitors in future.</p>
