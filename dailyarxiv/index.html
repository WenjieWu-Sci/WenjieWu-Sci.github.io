<p>2024-04-22, <strong>Two New $μ-τ$ Deviated Neutrino Mass Matrix Textures</strong>, Pralay Chakraborty et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14264v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.14264v1</a></p>

<p>We propose two new neutrino mass matrix textures deviating from $\mu-\tau$ symmetry and explore their phenomenological implications. Both textures predict $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta$ within sharp bounds while considering both normal and inverted ordering of neutrino masses. We try to realize these proposed textures within the framework of the seesaw mechanism, in association with the $SU(2)_L \times A_4 \times Z_3$ symmetry group.</p>

<p>2024-04-21, <strong>Electron and Muon $(g-2)<em>{e,μ}$ Anomalous Magnetic Moment in $U(1)</em>{L_e-L_μ}$ Symmetry Model</strong>, Rishu Verma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13546v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.13546v1</a></p>

<p>The nature of neutrino (whether Majorana or Dirac) and the origin of neutrino masses are still some of the mysteries to be resolved. Also, the recent results on (g-2)$_{e,\mu}$ measurements deviate from the Standard Model (SM) predictions and motivate us towards new physics beyond the SM. In this work, we propose a model with the minimal field content in the framework of anomaly free extension of Standard Model; i.e. U(1)$_{L_e-L_{\mu}}$ symmetry model. We find this model capable of explaining the low energy neutrino phenomenology and anomalous magnetic moment(g-2)$_{e,\mu}$ of electron and muon, simultaneously. The field content is extended by a SU(2)$_L$ singlet scalar field $\phi$ and three right handed neutrinos N$_R$(R = 1,2,3). Thus, the neutrino masses are generated using the Type-I seesaw mechanism. The extended model leads to the results, which are in consistency with the experimental values of (g-2)$_{e,\mu}$ and also satisfy all the relevant experimental data.</p>

<p>2024-04-22, <strong>DALI sensitivity to streaming axion dark matter</strong>, Javier De Miguel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13970v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.13970v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter substructures emerge naturally in a scenario in which the axion angular field acquires propagating degrees of freedom in a post-inflationary Universe. The DALI experiment is a new generation wavy dark matters interferometer currently in prototyping. Although DALI’s main objective is to explore the virialized DM in our Galaxy, to a large degree in this article we explore the prospect for detection of fine grained streams made of axions that would enter the Solar System, as suggested by previous work. We find that DALI will have a sensitivity to encounters with these coherent objects that fully spans the window defined by the coupling strength to photons of representative axion models over a stacked bandwidth of two decades in mass.</p>

<p>2024-04-22, <strong>Stochastic waveform estimation at the fundamental quantum limit</strong>, James W. Gardner et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13867v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.13867v1</a></p>

<p>Although measuring the deterministic waveform of a weak classical force is a well-studied problem, estimating a random waveform, such as the spectral density of a stochastic signal field, is much less well-understood despite it being a widespread task at the frontier of experimental physics. State-of-the-art precision sensors of random forces must account for the underlying quantum nature of the measurement, but the optimal quantum protocol for interrogating such linear sensors is not known. We derive the fundamental precision limit, the extended channel quantum Cram'er-Rao bound, and the optimal protocol that attains it. In the experimentally relevant regime where losses dominate, we prove that non-Gaussian state preparation and measurements are required for optimality. We discuss how this non-Gaussian protocol could improve searches for signatures of quantum gravity, stochastic gravitational waves, and axionic dark matter.</p>

<p>2024-04-21, <strong>The environmental low-frequency background for macro-calorimeters at the millikelvin scale</strong>, L. Aragão et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13602v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.13602v1</a></p>

<p>Many of the most sensitive physics experiments searching for rare events, like neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and dark matter interactions, rely on cryogenic macro-calorimeters operating at the mK-scale. Located underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), in central Italy, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is one of the leading experiments for the search of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, implementing the low-temperature calorimetric technology. We present a novel multi-detector analysis to correlate environmental phenomena with the low-frequency noise of low-temperature calorimeters. Indeed, the correlation of marine and seismic data with data from a pair of CUORE detectors indicates that cryogenic detectors are sensitive not only to intense vibrations generated by earthquakes, but also to the much fainter vibrations induced by marine microseisms in the Mediterranean Sea due to the motion of sea waves. Proving that cryogenic macro-calorimeters are sensitive to such environmental sources of noise opens the possibility of studying their impact on the detectors physics-case sensitivity. Moreover, this study could pave the road for technology developments dedicated to the mitigation of the noise induced by marine microseisms, from which the entire community of cryogenic calorimeters can benefit.</p>

<p>2024-04-21, <strong>New galaxy UV luminosity constraints on warm dark matter from JWST</strong>, Bin Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13596v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.13596v1</a></p>

<p>We exploit the recent {\it James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) determination of galaxy UV luminosity functions over the redshift range $z=9-14.5$ to derive constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) models. The delayed structure formation in WDM universe makes high redshift observations to be a powerful probe to set limits on the particle mass $m_\mathrm{x}$ of WDM candidates. By integrating these observations with blank-field surveys conducted by {\it Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) at redshifts $z=4-8$, we impose constraints on both astrophysical and WDM parameters simultaneously. We find a new limit of $m_\mathrm{x} \geq 3.2$ keV for the mass of thermal relic WDM particles at $95\%$ confidence level. This bound is tighter than the most stringent result derived using HST data before. Future JWST observations could further reduce the observation uncertainties and improve this constraint.</p>

<p>2024-04-21, <strong>Chern-Simmons electrodynamics and torsion dark matter axions</strong>, Zhifu Gao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13517v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.13517v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we delve into the influence of torsion axial pseudo vector on dark photons in an axion torsionic background, as investigated previously by Duncan et al[ Nucl Phys B 387:215 (1992)]. Notably, axial torsion, owing to its significantly greater mass compared to axions, gives rise to magnetic helicity in torsionful Chern-Simons (CS) electrodynamics, leading to the damping of magnetic fields. In QCD scale the damping from dark massive photons leads us to obtain a magnetic field of $10^{-8}$ Gauss, which is approximated the order of magnitude of magnetic fields at present universe. This result is obtained by considering that torsion has the value of the 1 MeV at the early universe, and can be improved to the higher value of $10^{-3}$ Gauss when the axial torsion 0-component is given by $10^{8}$ MeV and the mass of dark photon is approximated equal to the axion. The axion plays a crucial role in achieving CS dynamo action arising from axions. This study is useful in deepening our understanding of fundamental physics, from nuclear interactions to the nature of dark matter.</p>

<p>2024-04-22, <strong>Quantifying Scalar Field Dynamics with DESI 2024 Y1 BAO measurements</strong>, Kim V. Berghaus et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14341v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.14341v1</a></p>

<p>Quintessence scalar fields are a natural candidate for evolving dark energy. Unlike the phenomenological $w_0w_a$ parameterization of the dark energy equation of state, they cannot accommodate the phantom regime of dark energy $w(z) &lt; -1$, or crossings into the phantom regime. Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a preference for evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant, ranging from $2.6\sigma-3.9\sigma$ when fitting to $w_0w_a$, and combining the DESI BAO measurements with other cosmological probes. In this work, we directly fit three simple scalar field models to the DESI BAO data, combined with cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements and supernova data sets. Quantifying the preference for scalar field dynamics exhibited by the data, we find that $2-4\%$ of kinetic scalar field energy $\Omega_{\rm scf,k}$, is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at the $95\%$ confidence level, for a canonical scalar field with a quadratic or linear potential. Fitting to the supernova data sets Pantheon, Pantheon+, DES-Y5, and Union3, we show that the mild tension ($n_{\sigma}&lt; 3.4 $) under $\Lambda$CDM emerges from a BAO preference for smaller values of fractional mass-energy density $\Omega_m &lt; 0.29$, while all supernova data sets, except for Pantheon, prefer larger values, $\Omega_m &gt; 0.3$. The tension under $\Lambda$CDM remains noticeable ($n_{\sigma} &lt;2.8$), when replacing two of the DESI BAO measurements redshift bins with effective redshifts $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.706$ with comparable BOSS DR 12 BAO measurements at $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.61$. Canonical scalar fields as dark energy are successful in mitigating that tension.</p>

<p>2024-04-22, <strong>X-shooter spectroscopy of Liller1 giant stars</strong>, D. A. Alvarez Garay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14130v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.14130v1</a></p>

<p>We present the first comprehensive chemical study of a representative sample of 27 luminous red giant branch (RGB) stars belonging to Liller 1, a complex stellar system in the Galactic bulge. This study is based on medium-resolution near-infrared spectra acquired with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope. We found a subpopulation counting 22 stars with subsolar metallicity ($&lt;$[Fe/H]$&gt;=-0.31\pm0.02$ and 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.08 dex) and with enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [K/Fe] that likely formed early and quickly from gas that was mainly enriched by type II supernovae, and a metal-rich population counting 5 stars with supersolar metallicity ($&lt;$[Fe/H]$&gt;$=+0.22$\pm$0.03 and 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.06 dex) and roughly solar-scaled [$\alpha$/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [K/Fe] that formed at later epochs from gas that was also enriched by type Ia supernovae. Moreover, both subpopulations show enhanced [Na/Fe], as in the bulge field, about solar-scaled [V/Fe], and depletion of [C/Fe] and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C with respect to the solar values. This indicates that mixing and extra-mixing processes during the RGB evolution also occur at very high metallicities. Notably, no evidence of a Na-O anticorrelation, which is considered the fingerprint of genuine globular clusters, has been found. This challenges any formation scenarios that invoke the accretion of a molecular cloud or an additional stellar system onto a genuine globular cluster. The results of this study underline the strong chemical similarity between Liller 1 and Terzan 5 and support the hypothesis that these complex stellar systems might be fossil fragments of the epoch of Galactic bulge formation.</p>

<p>2024-04-22, <strong>The Self-Consistency of DESI Analysis and Comment on “Does DESI 2024 Confirm $Λ$CDM?”</strong>, Deng Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13833v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.13833v1</a></p>

<p>We demonstrate that the constraints on the evolution of dark energy implemented by the DESI collaboration may be insufficient or incomplete using their own BAO data. Using large enough prior ranges for the present-day equation of state of dark energy $\omega_0$ and amplitude of dark energy evolution $\omega_a$, we obtain the complete $1\,\sigma$ and $2\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=1.04^{+0.91+2.00}_{-1.00-1.90}$ and $\omega_a=-7.4^{+3.8+6.8}_{-3.2-7.3}$ indicating a beyond $2\,\sigma$ preference of quintessence-like dark energy today and an evidence of evolving dark energy at beyond $2\,\sigma$ CL, respectively. Our results are different from $\omega_0=-0.55^{+0.39}_{-0.21}$ and the $2\,\sigma$ upper limit $\omega_a&lt;-1.32$ reported by the DESI collaboration \cite{DESI:2024mwx}. Employing a data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova, we obtain the $1\,\sigma$, $2\,\sigma$ and $3\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=-0.707^{+0.089+0.18+0.24}_{-0.089-0.17-0.22}$ and $\omega_a=-1.09^{+0.38+0.67+0.82}_{-0.31-0.72-1.00}$, which reveals a $\sim4\,\sigma$ evidence of dynamical dark energy when the redshift $z\lesssim0.1$. We verify that the BAO data point from luminous red galaxies at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$ hardly affects the joint constraint from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova. We also point out the shortcomings and advantages of the binning method widely used in cosmological analyses.</p>

<p>2024-04-22, <strong>Open Cluster Dynamics under the Influence of Outflow-Ambient Interactions</strong>, Muxin Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13809v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.13809v1</a></p>

<p>Outflowing stars impinging upon ambient gas experience accelerations due to the gravitational feedback from the morphology of the interaction betweem the outflow and the ambient gas. Such “negative dynamical friction” (NDF), in contrast to the conventional “dynamical friction” (DF), is studied for its impact on the dynamics of open clusters immersed in a uniform ambient gas. We modify the $N$-body integration code REBOUND with both NDF and DF implemented according to the outflow conditions of each star in a consistently constructed model open cluster. The evolution of stars is also involved in determining the gas-star interactions throughout their stellar lives. Compared to DF-only and gas-free models with identical initial conditions, the NDF-affected cluster is puffier and evaporates faster, as indicated by various diagnostics, including lower velocity dispersions and larger half-mass and half-light radii. Neutron stars with fast winds are expelled from the cluster due to their intensive NDF effect, even without the “kicks” by asymmetric supernovae. Exploration of parameter space confirms that the NDF effect is generally enhanced with higher ambient gas densities, in qualitatively agreement with the expression of acceleration. Outflow-ambient interactions should be considered for the proper interpretation of the evolution of stellar dynamics in clusters.</p>

<p>2024-04-21, <strong>Galactic Superbubbles in 3D: Wind Formation and Cloud Shielding</strong>, Osmer Suárez-López et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13498v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.13498v1</a></p>

<p>Galactic superbubbles are triggered by stellar feedback in the discs of star-forming galaxies. They are important in launching galactic winds, which play a key role in regulating the mass and energy exchange in galaxies. Observations can only reveal projected information and the 3D structure of such winds is quite complex. Therefore, numerical simulations are required to further our understanding of such structures. Here, we describe hydrodynamical simulations targeting two spatial scales. Large-scale superbubble models reveal supernova-driven outflows, and their subsequent merging, which leads to galactic wind formation. Additionally, the turbulence parameter $\sigma_t$ not only affects disc formation, but also influences mass and energy characteristics, controlling gas distribution and the injection rate in the simulated star formation zone. Small-scale wind-multicloud models indicate that isolated clouds are susceptible to instabilities, leading to fragmentation and dense gas destruction. In contrast, in closer cloud configurations, the condensation mechanism becomes important owing to hydrodynamic shielding, which helps to maintain the cold material throughout the evolution of the system. These simulations provide a comprehensive picture of galactic winds, showing how large-scale superbubble dynamics create the environment where small-scale wind-multicloud interactions shape the interstellar and circumgalactic media, ultimately regulating galaxy evolution.</p>
