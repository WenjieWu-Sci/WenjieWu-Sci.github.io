<p>2025-11-06, <strong>Predictive one-zero with vanishing sub-trace texture in neutrino mass matrix in light of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay</strong>, Ankush et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04045v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.04045v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we investigate a predictive class of neutrino mass matrices characterized by one texture zero and one vanishing sub-trace within the framework of the scotogenic model, wherein neutrino masses, dark matter, and neutrinoless double beta decay are intrinsically correlated. We analyze twelve viable texture structures – namely $B_{1,4,5}$, $C_{1,2,\ldots,5}$, $D_{4,5}$, and $F_{5,6}$ – and examine their implications for the effective Majorana mass $(|M_{ee}|)$ governing neutrinoless double beta decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$. Remarkably, all non-zero entries of the neutrino mass matrix can be parametrized in terms of this effective Majorana mass, establishing a direct theoretical link between low-energy observables and high-scale parameters of the model.Among the twelve textures, eleven predict dark matter masses of order TeV and yield correlated bounds on $|M_{ee}|$ – making them testable in current and forthcoming $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments – while the textures $D_4$ and $F_{5,6}$ exhibit comparatively weaker correlations. In contrast, the texture $C_5$ is excluded due to its requirement of unrealistically large Yukawa couplings and its inability to realize dark matter in the TeV regime. Our analysis thus identifies a subset of predictive neutrino mass textures that consistently relate dark matter phenomenology and neutrinoless double beta decay observables within the scotogenic paradigm.</p>

<p>Theories of flavor operate at various scales. Recently it has been pointed out that in the context of modular flavor symmetries certain combinations of observables are highly constrained, or even uniquely fixed, by modular invariance and holomorphicity. We find that even in the absence of supersymmetry these combinations are surprisingly immune against quantum corrections.</p>

<p>2025-11-06, <strong>The role of final-state interaction modeling in neutrino energy reconstruction and oscillation measurements</strong>, Yinrui Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03964v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.03964v1</a></p>

<p>Next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments promise to provide dramatically improved measurements of PMNS neutrino oscillation parameters, including measurements of charge-parity violation in the lepton sector, in addition to searches for new physics. Achieving such precise measurements requires inferring neutrino oscillation probabilities over a wide neutrino energy range, which demands the most accurate neutrino energy reconstruction through precise measurements of all visible final-state particles produced in neutrino interactions. However, any reconstruction will inevitably miss a significant fraction of energy when it is, for example, carried away by neutrons, the nuclear remnant or unidentified charged pions. The size of the subsequent neutrino energy reconstruction bias is affected by many aspects of neutrino interaction physics, but the poorly understood re-interactions of struck hadrons within the nuclear medium, final-state interactions (FSI), are especially important. In this work, we assess how variations of FSI modeling affect neutrino energy reconstruction. As a case study, we use the neutrino flux and baseline of the upcoming DUNE experiment to illustrate that FSI model variations, in the absence of robust near-detector constraints, have the potential to be degenerate with variations of neutrino oscillation parameters at the level of projected precision for future measurements. The results highlight the need for further development of sophisticated FSI models, alongside capable near detectors at next-generation experiments to constrain them.</p>

<p>2025-11-06, <strong>Electroweak phase transition enhanced by a CP-violating dark sector</strong>, Venus Keus et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04636v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.04636v1</a></p>

<p>Within a well-motivated 3-Higgs doublet model, in which the extended dark sector accommodates CP violation, we analyse the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) at one- and two-loop order. We show the importance of higher loop calculations in EWPT analyses and identify the regions of the parameter space of our model where EWPT is of first order while in agreement with all theoretical and experimental bounds, including Dark Matter relic density and direct and indirect searches.</p>

<p>2025-11-06, <strong>The AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. X: Formation and Evolution of Galaxies at the High-redshift Frontier</strong>, Hyeonyong Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04435v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.04435v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations from JWST have revealed unexpectedly luminous galaxies, exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \geq 10$) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (${\rm M}_{\rm halo}\geq5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at $10\leq z\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.</p>

<p>2025-11-06, <strong>Artificial Precision Polarization Array: Sensitivity for the axion-like dark matter with clock satellites</strong>, Hanyu Jiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04400v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.04400v1</a></p>

<p>The approaches to searching for axion-like signals based on pulsars include observations with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and pulsar polarization arrays (PPAs). However, these methods are limited by observational uncertainties arising from multiple unknown and periodic physical effects, which substantially complicate subsequent data analysis. To mitigate these issues and improve data fidelity, we propose the Artificial Pulsar Polarization Arrays (APPA): a satellite network comprising multiple pulsed signal transmitters and a dedicated receiver satellite. In order to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter $g_{a\gamma}$, we generate simulated observations using Monte Carlo methods to investigate APPA’s sensitivity via two complementary approaches: Bayesian analysis and frequentist analysis. Simulations indicate that for axion mass $m_{a}\sim\mathcal{O}\big(10^{-22}-10^{-19}\big)$ eV, APPA yields a better upper limit on $g_{a\gamma}$ (at the 95\% confidence level) than conventional ground-based observations and achieves better detection sensitivity.</p>

<p>2025-11-06, <strong>An alternative theory of magnetic flux tubes in strong fields via axion origin photons</strong>, Vitaliy Rusov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04346v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.04346v1</a></p>

<p>In our alternative theory, built around the coincidence of experimental and theoretical data, three “free” parameters – the magnetic field in the tachocline of the order of ~10^7 G (see Fig.(A.1) and Eq.(A17) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), the axion mass ma ~3.2*10^{-2} eV (see Eq. (11) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), and the asymmetric dark matter (ADM) in the Universe with mADM ~5 GeV ((see V. D. Rusov et al. (2021); A. C. Vincent et al. (2016)) – give a complete solution to the problem of the theory of magnetic flux tubes in strong fields with 11-year variations of axion-origin photons, which are caused by and anticorrelated to the 11-year variations in density of ADM, gravitationally captured on the Sun.</p>

<p>2025-11-06, <strong>Observational Constrains on the Sgr A$^*$ Black Hole Immersed in a Dark Matter Halo: Shadow and S2 Star Orbit</strong>, Zhen Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04163v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.04163v1</a></p>

<p>It is widely believed that Sgr A$^<em>$, located at the center of our Galaxy, is a supermassive black hole. Recent observations of its shadow and long-term monitoring of the S2 star have provided compelling evidence supporting this hypothesis. These observational advancements also offer valuable opportunities to explore the physical properties of the black hole and its surrounding environment. Since a dark matter halo is expected to exist in the Milky Way and around Sgr A$^</em>$, investigating the behavior of the Galactic Center black hole embedded in such a halo provides a crucial means to simultaneously probe both black hole physics and dark matter properties. In this work, We develop a black hole metric that incorporates a generalized double power law dark matter halo, and analyze the corresponding null and timelike geodesics to investigate how the halo parameters affect the black hole shadow and the motion of the S2 star. Furthermore, by comparing our theoretical predictions with observational data of the shadow and the S2 orbit, we constrained the dark matter halo parameters. The results of this study provide both theoretical and phenomenological insights into the nature of Sgr A$^*$ and the distribution of dark matter in our Galaxy.</p>

<p>2025-11-06, <strong>Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. II. Spectroscopy</strong>, Adiba Amira Siddiqa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04122v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.04122v1</a></p>

<p>Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM) annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS), offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants. In \cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network (FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize dark star {\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to identify {\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST’s NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates recently identified in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and reconfirm that indeed \JADESeleven, \JADESzthirteen, \JADESfz, and \JADESfo have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte Carlo parameter estimator used in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster than the traditional method used in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data for high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool for probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution.</p>

<p>The formation of the first stars in the universe could be significantly impacted by the effects of Dark Matter (DM). Namely, if DM is in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), it could lead to the formation (at $z\sim 25-10$) of stars that are powered by DM annihilations alone, i.e. Dark Stars (DSs). Those objects can grow to become supermassive ($M\sim 10^6 \Msun$) and shine as bright as a galaxy ($L\sim 10^8 \Msun)$. Using a simple $\chi^2$ minimization, the first three DSs photometric candidates (i.e. \JADESeleven, \JADEStwelve, and \JADESzthirteen) were identified by \cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. Our goal is to develop tools to streamline the identification of such candidates within the rather large publicly available high redshift JWST data sets. We present here the key first step in achieving this goal: the development and implementation of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) search for Dark Star candidates, using data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) photometric catalog. Our method reconfirms JADES-GS-z13 and JADES-GS-z11 as dark star candidates, based on the chi-squared goodness of fit test, yet they are $\sim10^4$ times faster than the Neadler-Mead $\chi^2$ minimization method used in \cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. We further identify six {\it new photometric} Dark Star candidates across redshifts $z \sim 9$ to $z \sim 14$. These findings underscore the power of neural networks in modeling non-linear relationships and efficiently analyzing large-scale photometric surveys, advancing the search for Dark Stars.</p>

<p>2025-11-06, <strong>Low redshift observational constraints on dark energy models using ANN - CosmicANNEstimator</strong>, Ashly Joseph et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04033v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.04033v1</a></p>

<p>We present CosmicANNEstimator (Cosmological Parameters Artificial Neural Network Estimator), a machine learning approach for constraining cosmological parameters within the Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework. Our methodology employs two specialized artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed to analyze Hubble parameter and Supernova data independently. The estimator is trained on synthetic data covering broad parameter ranges, with Gaussian random noise incorporated to simulate observational uncertainties. Our results demonstrate parameter estimates and associated uncertainties comparable to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, establishing machine learning as an efficient alternative for cosmological parameter estimation. This work underscores the potential of neural network-based inference to complement traditional Bayesian methods and accelerate future cosmological analyses.</p>

<p>2025-11-06, <strong>Ultra-Diffuse, Ultra-Different: Observed vs. Simulated Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies Live in Fundamentally Different Halos</strong>, Jonah S. Gannon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04006v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.04006v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we compare galaxies from the NIHAO and HESTIA simulation suites to ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with spectroscopically measured dynamical masses. For each observed UDG, we identify the simulated dark matter halo that best matches its dynamical mass. In general, observed UDGs are matched to simulated galaxies with lower stellar masses than they are observed to have. These simulated galaxies also have halo masses much less than would be expected given the observed UDG’s stellar mass and the stellar mass – halo mass relationship. We use the recently established relation between globular cluster (GC) number and halo mass, which has been shown to be applicable to UDGs, to better constrain their observed halo masses. This method indicates that observed UDGs reside in relatively massive dark matter halos. This creates a striking discrepancy: the simulated UDGs are matched to the dynamical masses of observed ones, but not their total halo masses. In other words, simulations can produce UDGs in halos with the correct inner dynamics, but not with the massive halos implied by GC counts. We explore several possible explanations for this tension, from both the observational and theoretical sides. We propose that the most likely resolution is that observed UDGs may have fundamentally different dark matter halo profiles than those produced in NIHAO and HESTIA. This highlights the need for a simulation that self-consistently produces galaxies of a stellar mass of $\sim 10^8 M_\odot$ in dark matter halos that exhibit the full range of large dark matter cores to cuspy NFW-like halos.</p>

<p>2025-11-06, <strong>Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium XII. SN 2024acyl: A fast, linearly declining Type Ibn supernova with early flash-ionisation features</strong>, Y. -Z. Cai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04337v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.04337v1</a></p>

<p>We present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Type Ibn supernova (SN) 2024acyl. It rises to an absolute magnitude peak of about -17.58 mag in 10.6 days, and displays a rapid linear post-peak light-curve decline in all bands, similar to most SNe Ibn. The optical pseudobolometric light curve peaks at ($3.5\pm0.8) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with a total radiated energy of $(5.0\pm0.4) \times 10^{48}$ erg. The spectra are dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P-Cygni \Hei~lines and flash-ionisation emission lines of C {\sc iii}, N {\sc iii}, and He {\sc ii}. The P-Cygni \Hei~features gradually evolve and become emission-dominated in late-time spectra. The \Ha~line is detected throughout the entire spectral evolution, which indicates that the CSM is helium-rich with some residual amount of H. Our multiband light-curve modelling yields estimates of the ejecta mass of $M_{ej}$ = $0.98^{+0.30}_{-0.20} \, \msun$, with a kinetic energy of $E_{k} = 0.13^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \times 10^{51}$ erg, and a $^{56}Ni$ mass of $M_{\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.017 \, \msun$. The inferred CSM properties are characterised by a mass of $M_{\rm{CSM}} = 0.39^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ \msun, an inner radius of $R_0$=$15.6^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ AU, and a density $\rho_{CSM} = (1.32\pm0.22)\times10^{-11} \, \mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$. The multi-epoch spectra are well reproduced by the CMFGEN/ \texttt{he4p0} model, corresponding to a He-ZAMS mass of 4~M$_\odot$. These findings are consistent with a scenario of an SN powered by ejecta-CSM interaction, originating from a low-mass helium star that evolved within an interacting binary system where the CSM with some residual hydrogen may originate from the mass-transfer process. In addition, a channel of core-collapse explosion of a late-type Wolf-Rayet star with H, or an Ofpe/WN9 star with fallback accretion, cannot be entirely ruled out.</p>

<p>We present CosmicANNEstimator (Cosmological Parameters Artificial Neural Network Estimator), a machine learning approach for constraining cosmological parameters within the Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework. Our methodology employs two specialized artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed to analyze Hubble parameter and Supernova data independently. The estimator is trained on synthetic data covering broad parameter ranges, with Gaussian random noise incorporated to simulate observational uncertainties. Our results demonstrate parameter estimates and associated uncertainties comparable to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, establishing machine learning as an efficient alternative for cosmological parameter estimation. This work underscores the potential of neural network-based inference to complement traditional Bayesian methods and accelerate future cosmological analyses.</p>

<p>2025-11-06, <strong>Spectral Diversity in Type Ibn Supernovae and the Large Host Offset of SN2024acyl</strong>, Yize Dong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03926v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.03926v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we first present observations of SN~2024acyl, a normal Type Ibn supernova with a large projected offset ($\sim$35~kpc) from its host galaxy. The low star-formation rate measured at the explosion site raises the possibility that the progenitor of SN~2024acyl may not have been a massive star. We then examine, more broadly, the spectral diversity of Type Ibn supernovae around 20–35 days after peak brightness and identify two distinct groups: Group I, which shows bluer rest-frame optical color and narrower He~I emission lines; and Group II, which shows redder rest-frame optical color and broader He~I lines. Group~I also tends to show higher peak luminosities. The diversity we identify appears to be closely connected to the diversity observed around peak and to persist into late phases ($&gt;80$ days after peak). Given its redder color and broader He~I lines, we classify SN~2024acyl as belonging to Group II. Based on the current dataset, we find no clear connection between this spectral diversity and either the host environments of Type Ibn SNe or their pre-explosion activity. The observed diversity in Type Ibn SNe likely reflects differences in circumstellar material properties and/or explosion energetics. These differences could result from a range of progenitor properties, such as different helium star mass, orbital period and companion type if they are in binary systems, and may indicate fundamentally diverse progenitors. Whether a continuous distribution exists between the two groups remains to be determined and will require further data to explore.</p>
