<p>2025-06-17, <strong>Canadian Contributions to the Search for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay</strong>, Thomas Brunner et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14712v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14712v1</a></p>

<p>The search for neutrinoless double beta decay has internationally been recognized as the most promising approach to determine the Majorana nature of neutrinos. This hypothesized decay would, if observed, violate lepton number in weak interactions by two units, hence, prove the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model. Current experiments with sensitivity to neutrinoless double beta decay half lives of $10^{26}$ years did not observe such a decay and worldwide efforts are ongoing to deploy experiments with half-life sensitivities beyond $10^{28}$ years. Canadian groups have been involved in this search for more than four decades. This article summarizes the historical experimental efforts and describes current Canadian contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay searches and their theoretical interpretation.</p>

<p>2025-06-17, <strong>Axion-like particle limits from multi-messenger sources</strong>, Ariane Dekker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14659v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14659v1</a></p>

<p>High-energy neutrino observation from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 offers new insights into the non-thermal processes of active galactic nuclei. Simultaneous gamma-rays emitted by such sources can possibly oscillate into axion-like particles (ALPs) when propagating through astrophysical magnetic fields, potentially modifying the observed spectrum. To probe for ALP-induced signals, a robust understanding of the emission processes at the source is necessary. In this work, we perform a dedicated multi-messenger analysis by modeling a jet in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole of NGC 1068. We model in particular the neutrino and gamma-ray emission originating in lepto-hadronic collisions between jet accelerated particles and background particles from the corona, reproducing both the Fermi-LAT and IceCube data. These source models serve as a baseline for ALP searches, and we derive limits on the ALP-photon coupling by marginalizing over motivated ranges of astrophysical parameters. We find $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 7 \times 10^{-11}$GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-9}$ eV. These limits may be weaker than existing constraints, but they demonstrate the potential of multi-messenger observations to probe new physics. We conclude by discussing how additional upcoming multi-messenger sources and improved observational precision can enhance ALP sensitivity.</p>

<p>2025-06-17, <strong>The Future of Solar modelling: requirements for a new generation of solar models</strong>, Gael Buldgen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14514v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14514v1</a></p>

<p>Helioseismology and solar modelling have enjoyed a golden era thanks to decades-long surveys from ground-based networks such as for example GONG, BiSON, IRIS and the SOHO and SDO space missions which have provided high-quality helioseismic observations that supplemented photometric, gravitational, size and shape, limb-darkening and spectroscopic constraints as well as measurements of neutrino fluxes. However, the success of solar models is also deeply rooted in progress in fundamental physics (equation of state of the solar plasma, high-quality atomic physics computations and opacities, description of convection and the role of macroscopic transport processes of angular momentum and chemicals, such as for example meridional circulation, internal gravity waves, shear-induced turbulence or even convection. In this paper, we briefly outline some key areas of research that deserve particular attention in solar modelling. We discuss the current uncertainties that need to be addressed, how these limit our predictions from solar models and their impact on stellar evolution in general. We outline potential strategies to mitigate them and how multidisciplinary approaches will be needed in the future to tackle them.</p>

<p>2025-06-17, <strong>An independent search for Jovian neutrinos using BOREXINO data</strong>, Yuva Himanshu Pallam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14506v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14506v1</a></p>

<p>In a recent study, arXiv:2401.13043 found evidence for a 6% flux contribution from Jupiter to the total flux rate time series data from the BOREXINO solar neutrino experiment, specifically during the time intervals 2019-2021 and 2011-2013. The significance of this detection was estimated to be around $2\sigma$. We reanalyze the BOREXINO data and independently confirm the Jovian signal with the same amplitude and significance as that obtained in arXiv:2401.13043. However, using the same technique, we also find a spurious flux contribution from Venus and Saturn (at $\sim 2\sigma$ significance), whereas prima facie one should not expect any signal from any other planet. We then implement Bayesian model comparison to ascertain whether the BOREXINO data contain an additional contribution from Jupiter, Venus or Saturn. We find Bayes factors of less than five for an additional contribution from Jupiter, and less than or close to one for Venus and Saturn. This implies that the evidence for an additional contribution from Jupiter is very marginal.</p>

<p>2025-06-17, <strong>Study of the beyond standard model interaction using Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering process</strong>, S. P. Behera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14443v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14443v1</a></p>

<p>Phenomenological studies are carried out to find the potential reach of a detector to constraints on possible beyond the standard model general neutrino interactions in the neutrino-quark sector, for the proposed Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment (ICNSE) at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India. Reactors of different core configuration and power are used as sources of electron antineutrinos. The study has been carried out considering a target mass of 10 kg and an exposure of one year. It has been found that the ICNSE detector has a significant capacity to limit the majority of the Non-standard Interaction(NSI) parameter space. It has also been observed that a combination of results from two different types of detectors such as sapphire and high-purity germanium can significantly improve sensitivity by reducing the degeneracies between some pairs of NSI parameters to a smaller region.</p>

<p>2025-06-17, <strong>A simulation model investigation of neutron-oxygen inelastic scattering and subsequent nucleus deexcitation based on experimental data</strong>, Y. Hino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14388v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14388v1</a></p>

<p>The hadron interaction model for light nuclei plays an important role in understanding the event topology of neutrino-nucleus interaction in a large-scale neutrino detector. In the Super-Kamiokande experiment, the neutral current quasi-elastic interaction induced by atmospheric neutrinos introduces 68-82% uncertainty in the search for diffuse supernova neutrino background. This uncertainty stems from the mismodeling of the interaction between oxygen and fast neutrons generated by the neutral current quasi-elastic interaction, which is a crucial factor in the analysis. Therefore, a simulation study was performed, in which the newly released neutron-oxygen experimental data from the E487 and E525 experiments were compared. The result of comparing combinations of intranuclear cascade and deexcitation models is presented to choose a model that provides a superior prediction based on the experimental data.</p>

<p>2025-06-17, <strong>Leading-order gravitational time delay of massive particles by a moving Schwarzschild lens</strong>, Guansheng He et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14184v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14184v1</a></p>

<p>The leading-order gravitational time delay of relativistic neutral massive particles (e.g., neutrinos or high-energy cosmic-ray particles) caused by a moving Schwarzschild black hole with a constant radial velocity is investigated for the first time. On the basis of the equations of motion in the spacetime of the moving lens, we achieve a new unified formula for the travel times of relativistic massive and massless particles propagating from the source to the observer within the first post-Minkowskian approximation. The analytical form of the difference between the travel times of a relativistic massive particle and a light signal in this geometry, as well as that of two relativistic massive particles, is thus obtained in the weak-field and slow-motion limit. The influence of the radial lens motion on the leading-order Schwarzschild time delay of relativistic massive particles is then discussed. It is found that in the slow-motion limit, the radial lens motion towards the observer decreases the flight time of an ultrarelativistic massive particle, when compared with the case of no translational motion of the central body. Conversely, if the lens gets away from the detector radially under the same conditions, the propagation process of the particle will slow down and its flight time will thus increase in comparison with the Schwarzschild case. Finally, we analyze the magnitude of the full radial motion effect of the lens and evaluate the possibility of its astronomical detection by modeling three typical black holes as the lens respectively.</p>

<p>2025-06-17, <strong>Dark Matter signals in solar neutrinos fluxes as probe of non-linear symmetry breaking</strong>, A. Carrillo-Monteverde et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14089v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14089v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) particles gravitationally captured by the Sun can accumulate in its core and subsequently annihilate, producing neutrino fluxes that may be detectable on Earth. The intensity of these fluxes is highly sensitive to the properties of the underlying DM model, especially when the DM candidate is a scalar particle originating from spontaneous or non-linear symmetry breaking mechanisms. In this work, we explore the potential of solar neutrino fluxes to distinguish between the Standard Model extended by a scalar singlet and the non-linear Higgs portal scenarios in the context of a future DM discovery. We compute the expected neutrino fluxes within the regions of parameter space consistent with both relic density and current direct detection limits. Our results show that the non-linear model predicts neutrino fluxes that are systematically larger than those of the linear case, typically by at least one order of magnitude, and up to six orders of magnitude for DM masses around 1 TeV. These findings suggest that solar neutrino observations could provide a valuable probe to discriminate between these competing dark matter frameworks.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Deep-Inelastic Scattering at TeV Energies with LHC Muons</strong>, Reinaldo Francener et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13889v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13889v1</a></p>

<p>The LHC far-forward experiments FASER and SND@LHC have pioneered the detection of TeV-energy neutrinos produced in hard-scattering proton-proton collisions at the LHC. In addition to neutrinos, an intense flux of TeV-energy muons reaches these detectors, representing a dominant background for both neutrino studies and beyond the Standard Model searches. Here we demonstrate that this forward muon flux enables a comprehensive neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) program at FASER with a strong kinematical overlap with the Electron Ion Collider. For the Run 3 luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm pp}=250$~fb$^{-1}$, more than $10^5$ inclusive muon DIS events, of which up to $10^4$ for charm production, are expected at FASER$\nu$. As a representative application, we demonstrate the sensitivity of muon DIS at FASER$\nu$ to probe the (intrinsic) charm content of the proton at large-$x$. We also provide predictions for event yields of muon DIS for future FASER runs and for the proposed Forward Physics Facility.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>The Vacuum Moduli Space of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</strong>, Yang-Hui He et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13868v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13868v1</a></p>

<p>A starting point in the study of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is the vacuum moduli space, which is a highly complicated algebraic variety: it is the image of an affine variety $X \subset \mathbb{C}^{49}$ under a symplectic quotient map $\phi$ to $\mathbb{C}^{973}$. Previous work computed the vacuum moduli space of the electroweak sector; geometrically this corresponds to studying a restriction of $\phi$: $\mathbb{C}^{13} \stackrel{\phi^{\texttt{res}}}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{C}^{22}$. We analyze the geometry of the full vacuum moduli space for superpotentials $W_{\rm minimal}$ (without neutrinos) and $W_{\rm MSSM}$ (with neutrinos) in $\mathbb{C}^{973}$. In both cases, we prove that $X$ consists of three irreducible components $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$, and determine the images $M_i$ of the $X_i$ under $\phi$. For $W_{\rm minimal}$ we show they have, respectively, dimensions $1$, $15$, and $29$, and prove that each of the $M_i$ is a rational variety, while for $W_{\rm MSSM}$ we show that $M_3$ is the only component. Restricting the $M_i$ to the electroweak sector, we recover known results. We describe the components of the vacuum moduli space geometrically in terms of incidence varieties to a product of Segre varieties.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Dark Matter Freeze-In and Small-Scale Observables: Novel Mass Bounds and Viable Particle Candidates</strong>, Francesco DâEramo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13864v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13864v1</a></p>

<p>The suppression of cosmological structure at small scales is a key signature of dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in in the low-mass regime. We present a comprehensive analysis of its impact, incorporating recent constraints from Milky Way satellite counts, strong gravitational lensing with JWST data, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We adopt a general strategy to translate existing warm dark matter (WDM) bounds into lower mass limits for a broad class of DM candidates characterized by quasi-thermal phase space distributions. The benefits of this approach include computational efficiency and the ability to explore a wide range of models. We derive model-independent bounds for DM produced via two-body decays, scatterings, and three-body decays, and apply the framework to concrete scenarios such as the Higgs portal, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, and the dark photon portal. Results from specific models confirm the validity of the model-independent analysis.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>The fast, the slow and the merging: probes of evaporating memory burdened PBHs</strong>, Alessandro Dondarini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13861v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13861v1</a></p>

<p>The so-called memory-burden effect implies that evaporating Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) inevitably stabilize before complete decay. This stabilization opens a new mass window for PBH Dark Matter below $10^{15}\,$g. The transition to the memory-burdened phase is not instantaneous but unfolds over cosmological timescales, with some PBHs entering this phase in the present epoch. Additionally, a fraction of PBHs undergo mergers today, forming ââyoungââ semiclassical black holes that evaporate at unsuppressed rates. Both processes generate fluxes of stable astrophysical particles, which are constrained by current measurements of high-energy $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos. Moreover, the steep increase in energy injection at higher redshifts perturbs the ionization history of the Universe, leading to complementary bounds from observations of the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. We find that the reopened window enabled by the memory-burden effect is largely within reach of detection, both locally and across cosmological distances. We further describe how our findings restrict the values of the critical exponent characterizing the memory burden phenomenon.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Two-neutrino $0^+ \to 0^+$ double beta decay of $^{48}\mathrm{Ca}$ within the DFT-NCCI framework</strong>, Jan MiÅkiewicz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13747v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13747v1</a></p>

<p>We present a seminal calculation of the nuclear matrix element for the two-neutrino double beta ($2\nu\beta\beta$) decay of ${}^{48}\text{Ca} \rightarrow {}^{48}\text{Ti}$ using a post-Hartree-Fock (HF) Density Functional Theory-based No-Core Configuration-Interaction (DFT-NCCI) framework developed by our group [Phys. Rev. C 94, 024306 (2016)]. In the present calculation, we utilize a variant of the approach that restores rotational symmetry and mixes states projected from self-consistent mean-field configurations obtained by solving the HF equations with the density-independent local Skyrme interaction. Our calculations yield $|\mathcal{M}_{2\nu\beta\beta}| = 0.056(6)$ MeV$^{-1}$ for the nuclear matrix element describing this process. This result is in very good agreement with shell-model studies - for example, with the calculations by Horoi {\it et al.\/} [Phys. Rev. C 75, 034303 (2007)], which yielded 0.054 (0.064) MeV$^{-1}$ for the GXPF1A (GXPF1) interactions, respectively. It is also in a reasonable agreement with the most recent experimental estimate from the review by Barabash, which is 0.068(6) MeV$^{-1}$, assuming quenching $qg_\text{A} \approx 1$. The consistency of our prediction with the shell-model results increases our confidence in the nuclear modeling of this second-order, very rare process which is of paramount importance for further modeling of the neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay process.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Impact of embedded $^{163}$Ho on the performance of the transition-edge sensor microcalorimeters of the HOLMES experiment</strong>, Douglas Bennett et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13665v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13665v1</a></p>

<p>We present a detailed investigation of the performance of transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters with $^{163}$Ho atoms embedded by ion implantation, as part of the HOLMES experiment aimed at neutrino mass determination. The inclusion of $^{163}$Ho atoms introduces an excess heat capacity due to a pronounced Schottky anomaly, which can affect the detectorâs energy resolution, signal height, and response time. We fabricated TES arrays with varying levels of $^{163}$Ho activity and characterized their performance in terms of energy resolution, decay time constants, and heat capacity. The intrinsic energy resolution was found to degrade with increasing $^{163}$Ho activity, consistent with the expected scaling of heat capacity. From the analysis, we determined the specific heat capacity of $^{163}$Ho to be $(2.9 \pm 0.4 \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.7 \mathrm{(sys)})$ J/K/mol at $(94 \pm 1)$\,mK, close to the literature values for metallic holmium. No additional long decay time constants correlated with $^{163}$Ho activity were observed, indicating that the excess heat capacity does not introduce weakly coupled thermodynamic systems. These results suggest that our present TES microcalorimeters can tolerate $^{163}$Ho activities up to approximately 5 Bq without significant performance degradation. For higher activities, reducing the TES transition temperature is necessary to maintain energy resolution. These findings provide critical insights for optimizing TES microcalorimeters for future neutrino mass experiments and other applications requiring embedded radioactive sources. The study also highlights the robustness of TES technology in handling implanted radionuclides while maintaining high-resolution performance.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Joint analysis of reactor and accelerator CE$Î½$NS data on germanium: implications for the Standard Model and nuclear physics</strong>, M. Atzori Corona et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13555v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13555v1</a></p>

<p>This work presents the first comprehensive joint analysis of all available Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) data on germanium: those observed at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) by the COHERENT collaboration and those of the nuclear reactors revealed by the CONUS+ experiment using germanium detectors. In addition to COHERENT and CONUS+, we incorporate reactor data from TEXONO and $\nu$GeN, thereby enhancing both the statistical significance and the systematic reliability of our study. We provide state-of-the-art determinations of key nuclear physics and Standard Model parameters, including the neutron root-mean-square (rms) radius of germanium nuclei, the weak mixing angle, and the neutrino charge radius. The observed tension of about $2 \sigma$ between the COHERENT germanium measurement and the Standard Model prediction motivates a detailed reassessment of the theoretical cross-section. In particular, we examine the impact of nuclear form factors and uncertainties in the nuclear radius, as well as the potential influence of a systematic shift in the neutrino flux normalisation at the SNS. Our results highlight the reliability of CE$\nu$NS as a precision tool, reinforced by the complementarity of different experimental inputs, and lay the groundwork for future advances in the field.</p>

<p>Leptogenesis via axion oscillation after inflation is an alternate mechanism of thermal leptogenesis. In this mechanism, the requirement of the existence of a lepton number ($L$) violating process in equilibrium to drive the lepton number requires the temperature of leptogenesis at $\sim 10^{13}$ GeV. Triplet scalars, due to their interaction with gauge bosons, make a suitable candidate to prevail in the thermal bath via gauge scattering at such high energy. Also, owing to its interaction with Standard Model (SM) leptons and the Higgs scalar, it can mediate $\Delta L =2$ process. Moreover, just one triplet is enough to serve the purpose as opposed to thermal leptogenesis, where at least one more triplet scalar/right-handed neutrino is required to generate a sizable $CP$ violation. In this work, we study a model where the SM gauge group is extended with $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$, with the addition of one Higgs doublet, one scalar triplet, and one complex scalar singlet. The presence of a complex scalar singlet decouples the PQ symmetry breaking from the electroweak scale. It also provides a common source of an axion-like particle and seesaw scale. The scalar triplet offers a common link between leptogenesis via axion oscillation and neutrino mass. Further, with the presence of one triplet scalar, the lepton flavor violation process is directly determined from low-energy neutrino oscillation data.</p>

<p>The axion-converted-photons flux is a principal window for searching QCD axions as a dark matter (DM) candidate. In addition to solving the strong CP problem, these may explain the properties of the mysterious DM. Neutron star (NS) cooling by neutrino/axion emissions rate constrains the astrophysical properties of superdense matter. We attempt to analyse the impact of strong magnetic fields on the emission properties of NS by employing the FPS equation of State (EoS). We use the Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) equations by considering effects of strong fields and generating profiles. We assume Cooper-pair-breaking formation (PBF) and the Bremsstrahlung process occur in the core of NS. We adopt a polynomial fit function of radial profile to analyse the effects of strong magnetic field. Our entire analysis is at an axion mass of $15$ meV and central magnetic field $B_{c}$=$10^{17}$ G. Our work assumes the core comprises hadronic matter of the spherically symmetric magnetized NSs. We have present the results for the energy spectrum of axions and their subsequent conversion to photons. We show that the cooling rate and the luminosity of axions for NSs change significantly due to the intense magnetic field. We report that the energy spectrum of axions from the Bremsstrahlung process dominates over the PBF process at lesser axion energies, within the possible axion mass range for PSR J1356-6429 NS. Our results reveal that the impact of the magnetic field is less at lower axion energies, indicating the necessity for including a magnetic field in axion-to-photon conversion mechanisms.</p>

<p>We perform the calculation of nuclear matrix elements for the neutrinoless double beta decays under a Left-Right symmetric model mediated by light neutrino, and we adopt the spherical quasi-particle random-phase approximation (QRPA) approach with realistic force. For eight nuclei: $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{116}$Cd, $^{128}$Te, $^{130}$Te and $^{136}$Xe, related nuclear matrix elements are given. We analyze each term and the details of contributions of different parts are also given. For the $q$ term, we find that the weak-magnetism components of the nucleon current contribute equally as other components such as axial-vector. We also discuss the influence of short-range correlations on these NMEs. It is found that $R$ term are more sensitive to the short range correlation than other terms due to the large portion of the contribution from high exchange momenta.</p>

<p>We present a novel application of cosmological rescaling, or âremapping,â to generate 21 cm intensity mapping mocks for different cosmologies. The remapping method allows for computationally efficient generation of N-body catalogs by rescaling existing simulations. In this work, we employ the remapping method to construct dark matter halo catalogs, starting from the Horizon Run 4 simulation with WMAP5 cosmology, and apply it to different target cosmologies, including WMAP7, Planck18 and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. These catalogs are then used to simulate 21 cm intensity maps. We use the halo occupation distribution (HOD) method to populate halos with neutral hydrogen (HI) and derive 21 cm brightness temperature maps. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the remapping approach in generating cosmological simulations for large-scale structure studies, offering an alternative for testing observational data pipelines and performing cosmological parameter forecasts without the need for computationally expensive full N-body simulations. We also analyze the precision and limitations of the remapping, in light of the rescaling parameters $s$ and $s_m$, as well as the effects of the halo mass and box size thresholds.</p>

<p>The inspirals of supermaissive black hole binaries provide a convinced gravitational wave background in the nHz band, serving as the fiducial model of the recent gravitational wave signal reported by the PTA experiments. The uncertainties of the number of binaries contributing to each frequency bin introduce a foreground noise in the nHz and $\mu$Hz bands against the observation of the underlying gravitational wave backgrounds of the cosmological origin. In this work, we investigate a new method to constrain the cosmological gravitational wave strength under the astrophysical foreground. The energy density fluctuations from cosmological gravitational-wave sources can generally trigger the formation of compact subhalos of dark matter, and the upcoming Square Kilometer Array has the ability to constrain the abundance of the subhalos at the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ level. The cosmological gravitational wave energy spectra from various sources are expected to be constrained several orders of magnitude below the astrophysical foreground, providing more strict constraints on the parameter spaces of corresponding new physics models.</p>

<p>In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states with N photons added can significantly enhance the conversion probability.</p>

<p>The study of arXiv:2502.01174 geometrization of classical fields in the 4dâFinsler space of MES (Model of Embedded Spaces) is continued. The model postulates a proper metric set of a distributed matter element and states that the space-time of the Universe is a physical Embedding of such sets. The Embedding geometry is a Finsler-like relativistic geometry with connectivity depending on the mechanical state of matter: torsion and non-metricity are absent. The Least Action Principle provides the geodesic motion of matter, leads to nonlinearity of the system of field equations, anisotropy and Weyl-invariance of gravitation MES. It is shown that in the special case of Embedding (conformal Weyl metric) the geometrization of fields can be realized completely: namely, to obtain Maxwell-type equations and to find the gravitational sources, lying behind the $\Lambda$ term of Einstein-type equation. They are identified as dark matter and energy of the Universe, and the estimates of their material-field composition are close to the observed ones. It is also shown that the Embeddingâs gravitational and electromagnetic potentials are mutual gauge fields. Further development of the MES implies going beyond the Weyl metric.</p>

<p>The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature, imprinted in the transverse and radial clustering of dark matter tracers, enables the simultaneous measurement of the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at a given redshift. Further, measuring the redshift space anisotropy (RSD) allows us to measure the combination $f_8\equiv f\sigma_8(z)$. Motivated by this, we simultaneously study the dynamics of background evolution and structure formation in an abstract phase space of dynamical quantities $x=H_0 D_A/c$, $p = dx/dz$, and $f_8$. We adopt a semi-cosmographic approach, whereby we do not pre-assume any specific dark energy model to integrate the dynamical system. The Luminosity distance is expanded as a Pad'e rational approximation in the variable $(1+z)^{1/2}$. The dynamical system is solved by using a semi-cosmographic equation of state, which incorporates the dark matter parameters along with the parameters of the Pad'e expansion. The semi-cosmographic $D_A(z), H(z)$ and $f\sigma_8(z)$, thus obtained, are fitted with BAO and RSD data from the SDSS IV. The reconstructed phase trajectories in the $3D$ $(x,p,f_8)$ space are used to reconstruct some diagnostics of background cosmology and structure formation. At low redshifts, a discernible departure from the $\Lambda$CDM model is observed. The geometry of the phase trajectories in the projected spaces allows us to identify three key redshifts where future observations may be directed for a better understanding of cosmic tensions and anomalies.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Hawking Radiation Signatures from Primordial Black Holes Transiting the Inner Solar System: Prospects for Detection</strong>, Alexandra P. Klipfel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14041v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14041v1</a></p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) arise from the collapse of density perturbations in the early universe and serve as a dark matter (DM) candidate and a probe of fundamental physics. There remains an unconstrained ``asteroid-massââ window where PBHs of masses $10^{17} {\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} {\rm g}$ could comprise up to $100\%$ of the dark matter. Current $e^{\pm}$ Hawking radiation constraints on the DM fraction of PBHs are set by comparing observed spatial- and time-integrated cosmic ray flux measurements with predicted Hawking emission fluxes from the galactic DM halo. These constraints depend on cosmic ray production and propagation models, the galactic DM density distribution, and the PBH mass function. We propose to mitigate these model dependencies by developing a new local, time-dependent Hawking radiation signature to detect low-mass PBHs transiting through the inner Solar System. We calculate transit rates for PBHs that form with initial masses $M \lesssim 5\times10^{17}\text{g}$. We then simulate time-dependent positron signals from individual PBH flybys as measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in low-Earth orbit. We find that AMS is sensitive to PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm g}$ due to its lower energy threshold of $500 \, {\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that a dataset of daily positron fluxes over the energy range $5-500 \, {\rm MeV}$, with similar levels of precision to the existing AMS data, would enable detection of PBHs drawn from present-day distributions that peak within the asteroid-mass window. Our simulations yield ${\cal O} (1)$ detectable PBH transits per year across wide regions of parameter space, which may be used to constrain PBH mass functions. This technique could be extended to detect $\gamma$-ray and X-ray Hawking emission to probe further into the asteroid-mass window.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>The DORCHA suite: nature, nurture, and the phase space distribution of the Milky Wayâs high redshift progenitors today</strong>, Sreedhar Balu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14016v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14016v1</a></p>

<p>Where in the present-day Milky Way should we search for the remnants of its earliest stars? We address this question using the DORCHA (Gaelic for Dark; DUR-uh-khuh) suite: a set of 25 high-resolution, dark-matter-only cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way analogue (MWA) haloes evolved to $z=0$. Of these, 15 are isolated and the rest are in pairs, similar to the MW and M31. By identifying and tagging the most bound material in high-redshift ($z\geq5$) progenitor haloes â those likely to host early star formation â we track the present-day phase-space distribution of this ancient component. We find that this material is highly centrally concentrated at $z=0$, with 90 - 100 per cent residing within $r \lesssim 15\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}$. It exhibits steep density profiles ($\rho\propto\,r^{-4}$), low velocity dispersions ($\sigma_r / \sigma_{\rm max} \lesssim 0.6$), and radially biased orbits ($\beta \gtrsim 0.5$ for $r \gtrsim 0.1\,R_{200}$), consistent with a relaxed, centrally embedded population. These results hold across haloes with diverse formation histories and environments, suggesting that the dynamical signature of early progenitors is robust to later mergers and interactions. Our findings imply that the fossil record of the first generations of stars â including Population III and extremely metal-poor stars â should be sought in the innermost regions of the Milky Way, where they retain distinctive kinematic imprints. While these stellar populations may overlap, we caution that low metallicity does not uniquely identify ancient stars, nor vice versa. The DORCHA suite thus provides a physically motivated baseline for interpreting observations from Galactic Archaeology surveys targeting the bulge and inner halo.</p>

<p>We propose a multi-messenger frontier probe of non-thermal or freeze-in massive particle (FIMP) dark matter (DM) by considering an effective field theory (EFT) setup. Assuming leptophilic operators connecting DM with the standard model (SM) bath, we consider DM mass $m_{\rm DM}$ and the reheat temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm rh}$ in a regime which prevents DM-SM thermalisation. Low $T_{\rm rh}$ allows sizeable DM-SM interactions even for non-thermal DM allowing the latter to be probed at direct, indirect detection frontiers as well as future electron-positron and muon colliders. An extended reheating period governed by monomial inflaton potential after its slow-roll phase not only generates the required abundance of non-thermal DM via ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in but also brings the scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves (GW) within reach of near future experiments across a wide range of frequencies. While particle physics experiments can probe sub-GeV scale $T_{\rm rh}$ and FIMP with mass $m_{\rm DM} \lesssim O(10)$ GeV, future GW detectors are sensitive to a much wider parameter space.</p>

<p>We propose a new mechanism for the formation of seeds of supermassive black holes at early cosmic epochs. Enhanced density fluctuations with amplitudes that are not large enough to form primordial black holes post-inflation can still lead to collapsed dark matter halos at very early times. For halos forming prior to $1+z \approx 200$, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is energetic enough to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen, hence preventing cooling and fragmentation, as a consequence of which baryons falling into the potential well of the halo may undergo âdirect collapseâ into a black hole. We show using a few illustrative models how this mechanism may account for the abundance of high-redshift black holes inferred from observations by the James Webb Space Telescope while remaining consistent with current limits from CMB spectral distortions. Limits on the primordial power spectrum are also derived by requiring that the universe not reionize too early.</p>

<p>JWST has revealed the apparent evolution of the black hole (BH)-stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\rm{\ast}$) relation in the early Universe, while remaining consistent the BH-dynamical mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$) relation. We predict BH masses for $z&gt;3$ galaxies in the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM simulations by assuming the $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$ relation is fundamental. Even without live BH modelling, our approach reproduces the JWST-observed $M_\mathrm{BH}$ distribution, including overmassive BHs relative to the local $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{\ast}$ relation. We find that $M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\mathrm{\ast}$ declines with $M_\mathrm{\ast}$, evolving from $\sim$0.1 at $M_\mathrm{\ast}=10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to $\sim$0.01 at $M_\mathrm{\ast}=10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$. This trend reflects the dark matter ($f_\mathrm{DM}$) and gas fractions ($f_\mathrm{gas}$), which decrease with $M_\mathrm{\ast}$ but show little redshift evolution down to $z=3$, resulting in small $M_\mathrm{\ast}/M_\mathrm{dyn}$ ratios and thus overmassive BHs in low-mass galaxies. We use $\texttt{Prospector}$-derived stellar masses and star-formation rates to infer $f_\mathrm{gas}$ across 48,022 galaxies in JADES at $3&lt;z&lt;9$, finding excellent agreement with our simulation. Our results demonstrate that overmassive BHs would naturally result from a fundamental $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$ relation and be typical of the gas-rich, dark matter-dominated nature of low-mass, high-redshift galaxies. Such overmassive, rapidly growing BHs may strongly influence the earliest stages of galaxy formation.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Leo I: the classical dwarf spheroidal galaxy with the highest dark-matter density</strong>, R. Pascale et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13847v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13847v1</a></p>

<p>Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are known for being strongly dominated by dark matter (DM), which makes them convenient targets for investigating the DM nature and distribution. Recently, renewed interest in the dSph Leo I has resulted from claims suggesting the presence of a central supermassive black hole (BH), with mass estimates that challenge the typical expectations for dSphs, which are generally thought to host intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). However, Pascale et al. 2024 presented new upper limits on the BH mass, which are consistent with the range for IMBHs, solving the concerns raised in previous studies. Building on the analysis of Pascale et al. 2024, we examine the DM properties of Leo I inferred from the dynamical models of that paper. Our results indicate that Leo I is the galaxy with the highest DM density among the classical dSphs, with a central DM density (measured at a distance of $150$ pc from the galaxy centre) $\rho_{150}=35.5_{-4.7}^{+3.8}\times10^7\,M_\odot\,$pc$^{-3}$. The DM density profile has logarithmic slope $\gamma_{150}=-0.89_{-0.17}^{+0.21}$ at $150$ pc, in line with literature values. At smaller distances the DM distribution flattens into a core, with a core radius of $r_c=72^{+40}_{-32}$ pc. Combined with the small pericentric distance of Leo Iâs orbit in the Milky Way, the new estimate of $\rho_{150}$ makes Leo I decisive in the study of the anticorrelation between pericentre and central DM density, and suggests that the anticorrelation could be significantly steeper and more pronounced than previously estimated. Despite its DM dominance, Leo I does not emerge as the most favorable target for indirect DM detection: the inferred DM decay $D$ and annihilation $J$ factors, $\log D(0.5^{\circ})$ [GeV cm$^{-2}$] = $17.94_{-0.25}^{+0.17}$ and $\log J(0.5^{\circ})$ [GeV$^2$ cm$^{-5}$]= $18.13_{-0.18}^{+0.17}$ are consistent with previous estimates.</p>

<p>How the large-scale kinematics of the Milky Way (MW) relate â or even regulate â the formation of large-to-small scale structures is incredibly hard to infer from observations. Here we investigate this interplay through a detailed analysis of a MW-like galaxy simulation, generated through the self-consistent evolution of gas, stars, and dark matter. We show that our model provides a close match to many of the MWâs stellar structure and kinematic features (including in the inner Galaxy, and around the Solar neighbourhood), and find that the stellar spiral pattern in our model is very faint, with significantly less multiplicity than the sharper gaseous arms.If taken as an analogue to the MW, this finding would explain the difficulty in observational studies to agree on the number and location of our Galaxyâs spiral arms. We also examine radial and tangential velocity residuals in the disc, and find that sharp kinematic transitions correlate with spiral arms, especially in the gas, where values reach $30 - 50$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We find strong radial converging flows promoting spiral-arm growth, while diverging flows disrupt them. A time-resolved analysis of spiral-ridge segments confirms that convergence precedes density enhancements and potential star-forming conditions, while divergence leads to fragmentation and mass redistribution. These patterns evolve on relatively short timescales ($\sim10-20$\,Myr), highlighting the transient nature of spiral arms. Our modelâs spiral arms are dynamically driven, short-lived features shaped by evolving flows, rather than static density waves, which could explain the observed lack of contrast of cloud properties and star formation within and outside spiral arms in the MW.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Jet outbursts, non-thermal pressure and the AGN jet duty cycle</strong>, Andrew Sullivan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13422v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13422v2</a></p>

<p>We predict the non-thermal pressure (NTP) induced in the cores of galaxy clusters by kinetic jet feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We model a population of Fanaroff-Riley type I jets when sampling power-law distributions in jet power and age, which we evolve in time with a two-phase jet-lobe model. We couple the energy of each jet outburst to the surrounding gas inside spherical shells, allowing us to estimate the fraction of NTP to total pressure induced in the cluster. We predict the mean profile for this NTP fraction over the source population in a variety of cluster environments and for different AGN jet duty cycles. For typical gas and dark matter profiles, the mean NTP fraction peaks at ~4-6% when the AGN jets are active for 10-30% of the total AGN lifecycle. These predictions are in good agreement with observational constraints, suggesting that AGN feedback imparts only small non-thermal contributions to the clusterâs core. Furthermore, we find a relationship between the peak in the mean NTP fraction and the AGN jet duty cycle in a given cluster environment. Applying this to Hitomi measurements of the NTP in the Perseus cluster, we infer an AGN jet duty cycle that is consistent with independent evidence of Perseusâ AGN jet activity. We propose this as a novel approach for observationally inferring the past AGN activity of real clusters from their observed NTP fraction and environmental profiles.</p>

<p>This study examines the impact of solar modulation on the antiproton excess observed by AMS-02, which may indicate dark matter (DM) annihilation. We analyze three solar modulation models: the force-field approximation (FFA), a time-, charge-, and rigidity-dependent FFA, and a three-dimensional numerical simulation based on the Parker transport equation. Based on AMS-02 latest antiproton data (2025), our results show that the significance of the DM signal is sensitive to the chosen modulation model, with a 2$\sigma$ signal for the FFA (4$\sigma$ if including data from H, He, C, O, B/C, and B/O) and a reduced significance for more complex models. We also address systematic uncertainties using two methods: the add-in-quadrature method, which assumes uncorrelated uncertainties between energy bins, and the nuisance parameter method, which treats systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters during the fitting process. Fitted to AMS-02 antiproton data, DM annihilation to the $b\bar{b}$ scenario with three different solar modulation models shows that the add-in-quadrature method causes overfitting, whereas the nuisance parameters approach leads to underfitting. Statistically, the signal region of the FFA model using the add-in-quadrature method is the most reliable. This work highlights the need for refined solar modulation models and a better treatment of uncertainties for a conclusive interpretation of the AMS-02 data.</p>

<p>We examine a modified late-Universe dynamics where dark energy decays into dark matter, within the framework of metric $f(R)$-gravity in the Jordan frame. After a detailed analysis of the modified $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ model, we introduce a theoretical diagnostic tool to capture the emergence of an effective running Hubble constant as a function of redshift. We then compare this theoretical model with the 40-bin analysis of the Supernova Pantheon sample. This comparison allows us to determine the value of the additional free parameter that appears in our model, beyond those of the standard $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ model. Our modified late Universe dynamics provides a good-quality fit to the binned data, improving upon the previous phenomenological interpretation based on a power-law decay. However, unlike the power-law model, our approach cannot be extrapolated to the recombination redshift to match the Hubble constant measured by the Planck satellite. In fact, the dynamics resulting from the binned Pantheon sample analysis address only weakly the Hubble tension between the SH0ES and the Planck Collaboration values of the Hubble constant. Here we provide a convincing representation of the observed deviation of the cosmological dynamics from the $\Lambda$CDM-one, as it out-stands from the low redshift observed sources.</p>

<p>In this study, we explore the potential of using TianQin missions to probe the local gravitational effects of dark matter. The TianQin project plans to launch satellites at both low and high orbits. High-precision orbit determination is expected to assist in the Earthâs gravity or gravitational waves detection. By comparing the derived masses in low and high orbits, it is possible to constrain the amount of dark matter between the two spheres, hence placing a local constraint on dark matterâs gravity effect. Our results show the capability of TianQin in detecting the density of dark matter around Earth, with an ultimate sensitivity to a value of $10^{-8}\,\,{\rm kg\,\,m^{-3}}$. This detection limit surpasses the estimated bounds for the solar system and the observation results for our Galaxy by approximately 7 and 14 orders of magnitude, respectively.</p>

<p>2025-06-17, <strong>Technosignature Searches with Real-time Alert Brokers</strong>, Eleanor M. Gallay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14744v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14744v1</a></p>

<p>We present an exploration of technosignature research that is possible using real-time alert brokers from surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Nine alert brokers currently stream up to 1 million alerts each night from ZTF, and LSST is projected to increase this volume by an order of magnitude. While these brokers are primarily designed to facilitate real-time follow-up of explosive transients such as supernovae, they offer a unique platform to discover rare forms of variability from nearby stars in real time, which is crucial for follow-up and characterization. We evaluate the capability for both spatial and temporal searches for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) methods using the currently available brokers, and present examples of technosignature searches using ZTF alert and archival data. We have deployed optical SETI techniques, such as planetary transit zone geometries and the SETI Ellipsoid. We have also developed a search for novel high-amplitude stellar dippers, and present a workflow that integrates features available directly through the brokers, as well as post-processing steps that build on the existing capabilities. Though the SETI methods that alert brokers can execute are currently limited, we provide suggestions that may enhance future technosignature and anomaly searches in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</p>

<p>2025-06-17, <strong>Chemical Signatures of Population III Stars in Damped Lyman-$Î±$ Absorption Systems at $z \approx 6$</strong>, Eli Visbal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14482v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14482v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, Sodini et al. (2024) presented a sample of OI damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption system (DLA) analogs at $z\sim6$ that contain possible chemical signatures of Population III (Pop III) stars. In this paper, we use an N-body simulation-based semi-analytic model of the first stars and galaxies to predict the impact of Pop III stars on high-redshift DLAs. These Pop III DLA predictions are the first to include a number of important physical effects such as Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, reionization, and external metal enrichment (all of which account for three-dimensional spatial fluctuations caused by halo clustering). We predict the abundance of DLAs as a function of their carbon-to-oxygen ratios ([C/O]). We find that our fiducial model is strongly ruled out by the data as it contains too few high-[C/O] DLAs, which have metals primarily from Pop III stars. However, increasing the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation due to supernovae feedback leads to better agreement with the data. Our results suggest that DLA analogs at $z\sim6$ are a promising probe of Pop III star formation for two key reasons. First, for reasonable parameter choices there are significant numbers of DLAs with metals primarily originating from Pop III stars. Second, we find that the number of DLAs with substantial Pop III contributions depends strongly on the Pop III star formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation.</p>

<p>2025-06-17, <strong>Protostellar disks in their natural habitat â the formation of protostars and their accretion disks in the turbulent and magnetized interstellar medium</strong>, Alexander C. Mayer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14394v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.14394v1</a></p>

<p>We present simulations of the supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) in a simulation domain of volume $(256\,{\rm pc})^3$ within which we resolve the formation of protostellar accretion disks and their stellar cores to spatial scales of $\sim 10^{-4}$ au, using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We perform simulations with no magnetic fields, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and ambipolar diffusion, and compare the resulting first Larson cores and their associated structures, including the accretion disks, their location within the larger-scale structure and the streamers connecting these. We find that disks of sizes $10-100\,{\rm au}$ form early in the simulations without magnetic fields, while there are no disks larger than 10 au with ideal MHD. Ambipolar diffusion causes large disks to form in a subset of cases (two out of six cores), and generally reduces the strength of outflows, which are seen to play a central role. When they are able to carry away significant angular momentum, they prevent the formation of a rotationally supported disk. Magnetic fields strengths grow from $0.1 - 1$ mG in the protostellar core to more than 10 G in the first Larson core in all simulations with ideal MHD. The rotationally supported disks which form can have rotation speeds $&gt; 1$ km s$^{-1}$ even out to further than 100 au from the centre, become gravitationally unstable and form complex spiral substructures with Toomre $Q &lt; 1$. We conclude that the impact of magnetic fields and non-ideal MHD on the formation of protostellar disks is substantial in realistic formation scenarios from the turbulent ISM.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Rotational Variables: Kepler Versus ASAS-SN</strong>, Jack Stethem et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13919v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13919v1</a></p>

<p>Rotational variables are stars that vary in brightness due to star spots modulated by rotation. They are probes of stellar magnetism, binarity, and evolution. Phillips et al. (2023) explored distinct populations of ~50,000 high-amplitude rotational variables from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), examining correlations between stellar rotation, binarity, and activity. Here, we carry out a similar analysis of ~50,000 much lower amplitude Kepler rotational variables. The Kepler population is dominated by slowly rotating, single, main sequence stars, with a striking absence of the rapidly rotating main sequence group in the ASAS-SN sample. The binary fractions of the Kepler rotators are significantly lower than for the ASAS-SN systems and they are significantly less spotted, as expected from their lower amplitudes. The scope of these statistical surveys will dramatically increase in the near future.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Interstellar dust production, destruction and effects of dust depletion in galaxies</strong>, Francesco Calura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13851v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13851v1</a></p>

<p>Despite its small mass fraction typically observed in the interstellar medium, dust plays a significant role as a key component of galaxies, affecting a wide range of properties. This review focuses specifically on how dust grains influence interstellar chemical abundances and on the processes that regulate the evolution of the galactic dust budget. I describe the main physical processes regulating dust evolution, including production by stars and other sources, destruction in supernova shocks and interstellar growth and how they are included in galactic chemical evolution models. I discuss the main effects of interstellar dust on the abundances measured in various high-redshift systems that include Damped Lyman alpha absorbers detected along the lines of sight of distant quasars and in the absorption spectra of Gamma Ray Burst afterglows. I discuss the measure of the dust mass in galaxies and review its global budget, evaluated through the study of the evolution of the comoving dust mass density, for which I present an up-to-date compilation of data chosen from the literature. Interstellar dust growth plays a critical role in regulating the dust budget, for which I present a list of evidence both in favour of it and against. The dust budget at high redshift is one aspect that requires attention to drive significant progress in the future, along with the investigation of the properties of dust in local, low-metallicity systems. Our poor theoretical knowledge of basic aspects related to dust evolution evidences the need for a new high-sensitivity space telescope operating in the far-infrared regime, still awaited by the community since the demise of Herschel.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Supernova explosions of runaway stars and young neutron stars above the Galactic plane</strong>, Vinka DakiÄ et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13660v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13660v1</a></p>

<p>Several supernova remnants and young neutron stars were recently discovered relatively high above the Galactic plane. One possibility is that they originate from runaway OB stars born in the Galactic disk. Understanding their origin will provide key insights into the properties of the Galactic halo. This paper aims to determine the spatial distribution of supernova explosions from runaway OB stars and to assess whether this model can explain certain observed neutron stars. We map the distribution of supernova events produced by runaway OB stars by incorporating their birth rate, initial spatial distribution, lifetime, ejection mechanisms, and velocity distributions. By tracking their motion in the Galactic potential, we determine their final distribution right before the explosion. We show that the neutron star Calvera, which is found at z around 2.2 kpc, could have originated from a runaway OB star. In addition, we compare the probabilities of finding a supernova remnant originating from Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae high above the Galactic plane, showing that supernova remnants related to core-collapse supernovae outnumber those related to Type Ia supernovae.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Decay of dark energy into dark matter in a metric $f(R)$ gravity: effective running Hubble constant</strong>, Giovanni Montani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13288v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13288v1</a></p>

<p>We examine a modified late-Universe dynamics where dark energy decays into dark matter, within the framework of metric $f(R)$-gravity in the Jordan frame. After a detailed analysis of the modified $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ model, we introduce a theoretical diagnostic tool to capture the emergence of an effective running Hubble constant as a function of redshift. We then compare this theoretical model with the 40-bin analysis of the Supernova Pantheon sample. This comparison allows us to determine the value of the additional free parameter that appears in our model, beyond those of the standard $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ model. Our modified late Universe dynamics provides a good-quality fit to the binned data, improving upon the previous phenomenological interpretation based on a power-law decay. However, unlike the power-law model, our approach cannot be extrapolated to the recombination redshift to match the Hubble constant measured by the Planck satellite. In fact, the dynamics resulting from the binned Pantheon sample analysis address only weakly the Hubble tension between the SH0ES and the Planck Collaboration values of the Hubble constant. Here we provide a convincing representation of the observed deviation of the cosmological dynamics from the $\Lambda$CDM-one, as it out-stands from the low redshift observed sources.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Logarithmic and Strong Coupling Models in Weyl-Type $f(Q,T)$ Gravity</strong>, Rahul Bhagat et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13126v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13126v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we have explored the cosmological implications of Weyl-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity, a modified gravitational theory formulated from Weyl geometry. The nonmetricity scalar $Q$ is coupled to the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor. We analyze two models based on the logarithmic and strong coupling form of the function $f(Q,T)$. The corresponding field equations are then solved numerically after reformulating the system in terms of redshift. We used combined dataset from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon$^+$ supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and performed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the model parameters. Using the constrained parameters, the geometrical and dynamical aspects of the models are analyzed. The results successfully describe a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion for both the models. The models mostly exhibit quintessence-like behavior and asymptotically approach the $\Lambda$CDM scenario at late times. The calculated age of the Universe from each model aligns with constraints from Planck and stellar age data. The violation of the strong energy condition and the satisfaction of null energy condition and dominant energy conditions are shown.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>Simple quintessence models in light of DESI-BAO observations</strong>, James M. Cline et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13047v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13047v1</a></p>

<p>Recent analyses from the DESI collaboration suggest that the dark energy density of the Universe may be decreasing with time, slowing the acceleration of the scale factor $a$. Typically these studies are performed assuming an ansatz for the equation of state $w(a)$. In this work, we instead consider simple models of a scalar quintessence potential with linear and quadratic behavior, which could be more representative of real models than particular parametrizations of $w(a)$. We observe a significant preference for dynamical dark energy when using supernova data from DESY5 along with DESI BAO and Planck data, at the cost of slightly exacerbating the Hubble tension. However, when using supernova data from Pantheon+ or Union3, we find only a mild preference for dynamical dark energy.</p>

<p>2025-06-16, <strong>New Field OB and OBe Binaries of the SMC Wing: Observational Properties and Population Modeling</strong>, Irene Vargas-Salazar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13004v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.13004v1</a></p>

<p>We present a radial velocity (RV) survey of the field OB and OBe stars of the SMC Wing. We use multi-epoch observations of 55 targets obtained with the Magellan IMACS and M2FS multi-object spectrographs to identify single- and double-lined spectroscopic binaries. We also use TESS light curves to identify new eclipsing binary candidates. We find that 10 each of our 34 OB (29\%) and 21 OBe (48\%) stars are confirmed binaries, and at least $\sim$ 6 more are candidates. Using our RV measurements, we set constraints on the companion masses, and in some cases, on periods, eccentricities and inclinations. The RV data suggest that OB binaries favor more circular orbits (mean eccentricity $\langle e\rangle = 0.08\pm 0.02$) while OBe binaries are eccentric ($\langle e\rangle = 0.45\pm 0.04$). We identify 2 candidate black hole binaries, [M2002] 77616, and 81941. We use BPASS to predict the frequencies of ejected OB and OBe stars and binaries, assuming OBe stars are binary mass gainers ejected by the companion supernova. We also predict the frequencies of black-hole, neutron-star, and stripped-star companions, and we model the distributions of primary and secondary masses, periods, eccentricities, and velocity distributions. The models are broadly consistent with the binary origin scenario for OBe stars, and predict an even larger number of post-supernova OB binaries. Comparison with the kinematics supports a significant contribution from dynamical ejections for both OB and OBe stars, although less so for binaries.</p>
