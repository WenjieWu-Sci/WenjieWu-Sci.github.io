<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Neutrino mixing parameters and masses from $Δ(96)\rtimes H_{CP}$ in the tri-direct CP approach</strong>, Li-Na Yan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02840v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02840v1</a></p>

<p>We present a comprehensive model independent analysis of all breaking patterns resulting from $\Delta(96)\rtimes H_{CP}$ in the tri-direct CP approach of the minimal seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos. The three generations of left-handed lepton doublets are assumed to transform as the irreducible triplet $\bm{3_{0}}$ of $\Delta(96)$, and the two right-handed neutrinos are assigned to singlets. In the case that both flavon fields $\phi_{\text{atm}}$ and $\phi_{\text{sol}}$ transform as triplet $\bm{\bar{3}_{0}}$, only one phenomenologically viable lepton mixing pattern is obtained for normal ordering neutrino masses. The lepton mixing matrix is predicted to be TM1 pattern, with neutrino masses, mixing angles, and CP violation phases depending on only three real input parameters. When $\phi_{\text{sol}}$ is assigned to the $\bm{\bar{3}_{1}}$ representation, an additional real parameter $x$ must be included. Then we find 42 independent phenomenologically interesting mixing patterns, and the corresponding predictions for lepton mixing parameters and neutrino masses are obtained. Furthermore, we perform a detailed numerical analysis for five example breaking patterns with some benchmark values of $x$. The absolute values of the first columns of PMNS matrix are fixed to be $\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{5}\left(\sqrt{17},2,2\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{38}}\left(5,2,3\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{57}}\left(\sqrt{37},\sqrt{10},\sqrt{10}\right)^{T}$ and $\frac{1}{3}\left(\sqrt{6},1,\sqrt{2}\right)^{T}$, respectively.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Matching from quark to hadronic operators: external source vs spurion methods</strong>, Gang Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02538v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02538v1</a></p>

<p>Various weak processes at the hadronic scale have been utilized to search for new physics at high energy scale, which can be described by the QCD chiral Lagrangian matched from the low-energy effective theory (LEFT). Utilizing the chiral symmetry $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R \to SU(2)_V$ at the quark and hadronic levels, we make a comprehensive comparison of various matching methods, including the external source method, conventional spurion method, and our systematic spurion method. Although different methods show agreements for dimension-6 LEFT operator matching, we find that for higher-dimensional operators, the external source method is quite limited or inapplicable, the conventional spurion methods needs to introduce more and more spurions, while our spurion method does not need to introduce any new spurions than the ones in the dimension-6 matching. Using minimal set of spurions, we thus establish an one-to-one correspondence between the LEFT and chiral operators, with several examples, such as derivative operators at dimensions 7 and 8 with a single bilinear, four-quark operators at the dimension-9 level with two quark bilinears, which can be applied to the study of neutrino/electron scatterings and neutrinoless double beta decay.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Hadronic origin of the very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278</strong>, Asahi Shoji et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02326v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02326v1</a></p>

<p>The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has detected very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from NGC 4278, which is known to host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Having only very weak radio jets, the origin of its VHE gamma rays is unclear. In this paper we first show that NGC 4278 has a massive molecular cloud surrounding the nucleus by analyzing data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We then assume that cosmic ray protons are accelerated in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the supermassive black hole, which diffuse into the molecular cloud and produce gamma rays and neutrinos via $pp$ interactions. We model the gamma-ray spectra and find that the observations can be explained by such hadronic processes if the AGN activity was higher in the past than at present, and the diffusion coefficient in the molecular cloud is appreciably smaller than in the Milky Way interstellar medium. However, we also show that the high-energy neutrinos co-produced with the gamma rays are unlikely to be detectable even with IceCube-Gen2.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Prospects for PBR detection of KM3-230213A-like events</strong>, Angela V. Olinto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02246v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02246v1</a></p>

<p>POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a scaled-down version of the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) design, optimized to be flown as a payload on one of NASA’s sub-orbital super pressure balloons circling the Earth above the southern oceans for a mission duration of more than 20 days. One of the main science objectives of PBR is to follow up astrophysical event alerts in search of neutrinos with very high energy ($10^8 \lesssim E_\nu /{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{10}$). Of particular interest for anticipated PBR observations, the KM3NeT Collaboration has recently reported the detection of the neutrino KM3-230213A with $10^{8.1} \lesssim E_\nu/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{8.9}$. Such an unprecedented event is in tension with upper limits on the cosmic neutrino flux from IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory: for a diffuse isotropic neutrino flux there is a $3.5\sigma$ tension between KM3NeT and IceCube measurements, and about $2.6\sigma$ if the neutrino flux originates in transient sources. Therefore, if KM3-230213A was not beginner’s luck, it becomes compelling to consider beyond Standard Model (BSM) possibilities which could lead to a signal at KM3NeT-ARCA but not at IceCube/Auger. We calculate the PBR horizon-range sensitivity to probe BSM physics compatible with observation at KM3NeT-ARCA and non-observation at IceCube/Auger. As an illustration, we consider a particular class of BSM physics models which has been described in the literature as a possible explanation of KM3-230213A.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Relativistic accretion and burdened primordial black holes</strong>, Suvashis Maity et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02821v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02821v1</a></p>

<p>We examine the joint effects of relativistic accretion and memory burdened evaporation on the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs). The memory burden effect, which delays the evaporation by inducing a backreaction and making the evaporation rate scale as an inverse power law of the PBH entropy, opens up a new window that allows PBHs with $M \lesssim 10^{15}~\mathrm{g}$ to survive until the present epoch. Meanwhile, accretion increases the mass of PBHs, thereby enhancing their chances of survival for a given initial mass. We consider two main scenarios: one where PBHs evaporate completely before big bang nucleosynthesis, and another where PBHs persist until today. In the case of evaporation, we analyse the emission of dark matter (DM) and dark radiation (DR) during the process of evaporation. Conversely, in the other case, the surviving PBHs themselves can contribute as DM. We further investigate how relativistic and non-relativistic accretion, together with memory burdened evaporation, impact the parameter space of the emitted DM, the abundance of stable PBHs as DM, and the contribution of DR to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}$.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Bayesian frequency estimation at the fundamental quantum limit</strong>, James W. Gardner et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02811v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02811v1</a></p>

<p>Searching for a weak signal at an unknown frequency is a canonical task in experiments probing fundamental physics such as gravitational-wave observatories and ultra-light dark matter haloscopes. These state-of-the-art sensors are limited by quantum noise arising from the fundamental uncertainty about the state of the device. Classically, frequency estimation suffers from a threshold effect in the signal-to-noise ratio such that weak signals are extremely hard to localise in frequency. We show that this phenomenon persists at the fundamental quantum limit but that the classical approach, a quadrature measurement, can nevertheless be beaten by a coherent protocol of projecting onto the “quantum whitened” possible quantum states. Quantum whitening is a covariant measurement, and we examine it analytically in the wide-prior limit and numerically for finite-width priors. Beyond accelerating searches for unknown frequencies, quantum whitening may be used generally to sense the parameter of a unitary encoding given no prior information about the parameter.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Advancements in Computing and Simulation Techniques for the HIBEAM-NNBAR Experiment</strong>, Bernhard Meirose et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02810v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02810v1</a></p>

<p>The HIBEAM-NNBAR program is a proposed two-stage experiment at the European Spallation Source focusing on searches for baryon number violation processes as well as ultralight dark matter. This paper presents recent advancements in computing and simulation, including machine learning for event selection, fast parametric simulations for detector studies, and detailed modeling of the time projection chamber and readout electronics.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>An Ultra-Cold Mechanical Quantum Sensor for Tests of New Physics</strong>, Andraz Omahen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02653v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02653v1</a></p>

<p>Initialization of mechanical modes in the quantum ground state is crucial for their use in quantum information and quantum sensing protocols. In quantum processors, impurity of the modes’ initial state affects the infidelity of subsequent quantum algorithms. In quantum sensors, excitations out of the ground state contribute to the noise of the detector, and their prevalence puts a bound on rare events that deposit energy into the mechanical modes. In this work, we measure the excited-state populations of GHz-frequency modes in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR). We find that the population of the first excited state can be as low as $P_p$=(1.2$\pm$5.5)$\times10^{-5}$, corresponding to an effective temperature of 25.2 mK, which are upper bounds limited by imperfections in the measurement process. These results compare favorably to the lowest populations measured in superconducting circuits. Finally, we use the measured populations to constrain the amplitude of high-frequency gravitational waves, the kinetic mixing strength of ultra-light dark matter, and non-linear modifications of the Schr"{o}dinger equation describing wavefunction collapse mechanisms. Our work establishes HBARs as a versatile resource for quantum state initialization and studies of fundamental physics.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</strong>, Meng-Lin Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02651v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02651v1</a></p>

<p>Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Entropy Analysis of Dark Matter Halo Structures</strong>, Abdelhakim Benkrane et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02610v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02610v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we aim to derive the entropy associated with a dark matter halo modeled using a double (broken) power-law density profile. Our approach is inspired by the pioneering work of Verlinde, who proposed that gravity may not be a fundamental force but rather an emergent phenomenon rooted in entropic principles. To investigate this idea, we examine four different dark matter halo profiles: the Dehnen-type, Hernquist, Jaffe, Plummer sphere, and the perfect sphere. Using these profiles, we derive corresponding entropy expressions and assess their consistency with the second law of thermodynamics, which governs the behavior of entropy in closed systems. Furthermore, to broaden the scope of our analysis, we extend the study to a cosmological context, allowing us to explore how the derived entropy expressions influence the dynamics of the Friedmann equations that describe the evolution of the universe.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>LHC and dark matter implications of t-b-τ Yukawa unification in split SUSY GUTs</strong>, Mureed Hussain et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02566v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02566v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a grand unification (GUT) inspired version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM)   based on a left-right symmetric $4$-$2$-$2$ gauge group, incorporating Yukawa coupling unification and current   phenomenological constraints. Utilizing a split soft supersymmetry-breaking (SSB) parameter space motivated by   flavor symmetries, we analyze the implications of recent results from ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, and dark matter direct   detection experiments. Our numerical scans, conducted with SARAH and SPheno, identify viable low-energy regions   consistent with third-generation Yukawa unification, the observed Higgs boson mass, dark matter relic density,   and flavor observables such as $B \to X_s \gamma$, $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $B_u \to \tau \nu_{\tau}$ .   Our findings suggest that while current bounds severely constrain much of the   MSSM-like parameter space, substantial regions remain experimentally viable and testable in the ongoing LHC run   and next-generation dark matter experiments.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Dipolar dark matter theory based on a non-Abelian Yang-Mills field</strong>, Luc Blanchet et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02563v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02563v1</a></p>

<p>Most theories that attempt to reproduce the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) phenomenology for dark matter at galactic scales rely on ad hoc free functions, preventing them from being regarded as fundamental. In this work, we present a new theory that reproduces MOND, built on a supposed to be fundamental Yang-Mills gauge field based on SU(2), with a gravitational coupling constant, and emerging in a low-acceleration regime, below the MOND acceleration scale. The gauge field plays the role of the internal force in the dipolar dark matter (DDM) model. We discuss how certain solutions of this theory recover the deep MOND regime without introducing arbitrary functions in the action. Within this framework, the MOND phenomenology appears to be due to the existence of a new sector of particle physics.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Optimisation of amplification and gas mixture for directional Dark Matter searches with the CYGNO/INITIUM project</strong>, Giorgio Dho et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02474v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02474v1</a></p>

<p>Astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of beyond standard model ingredient known as dark matter (DM). One of the most supported class of theories suggests that DM is composed of weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs), possibly detectable via weak interaction with standard matter resulting in the recoil of the latter. The motion of the Sun and Earth with respect to the Galactic Centre is expected to induce a strong directional dependence in the recoil spectrum. Direct detection experiments capable of measuring the angular features of the recoils gain access to a wide range of advantages such as the possibility to positively claim a discovery of DM. The CYGNO project sets into this context, with the aim of deploying a large directional detector for rare event searches as DM. It exploits a gaseous time projection chamber filled with a He:CF4 gas mixture with a segmented amplification stage and granular optical readout. In this thesis, it is presented the work carried out with small CYGNO prototypes to maximise the light yield without degrading spatial and energy resolution, the addition of highly electronegative gases to induce a reduction of the electron cloud diffusion while drifting towards the amplification stage, very relevant to precisely measure the topological information of the recoil tracks. Moreover, the potential performances of directional detectors in the context of a direct DM search are analysed with the use of rigorous statistical tools both in the improvement in setting limits in the WIMP to nucleon sensitivity and in the capability of discerning two different DM models exploiting a directional detector.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>COSINUS – a model-independent challenge of the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter claim with cryogenic NaI detectors operated in a new low-background facility</strong>, G. Angloher et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02429v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02429v1</a></p>

<p>Low-temperature detectors are a powerful technology for dark matter search, offering excellent energy resolution and low energy thresholds. COSINUS is the only experiment that combines scintillating sodium iodide (NaI) crystals with an additional phonon readout at cryogenic temperatures, using superconducting sensors (remoTES), alongside the conventional scintillation light signal. Via the simultaneous phonon and scintillation light detection, a unique event-by-event particle identification is enabled. This dual-channel approach allows for a model-independent cross-check of the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA signal with a moderate exposure of a few hundred kg d, while completely avoiding key systematic uncertainties inherent to scintillation-only NaI-based searches. COSINUS built and commissioned a dedicated low-background cryogenic facility at the LNGS underground laboratories. Data taking with eight NaI detector modules (COSINUS1$\pi$ Run1) is planned to begin in late 2025.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Estimation of gravitational production uncertainties</strong>, Jose A. R. Cembranos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02410v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02410v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmological production of scalar, non-minimally coupled dark matter depends on the specifics of the inflationary model under consideration. We analyze both Starobinsky inflation and a quadratic potential, solve the full background dynamics, study pair production during inflation and reheating, and find that the observed dark matter abundance can be explained solely by this mechanism, regardless of the inflationary model. Qualitative differences between the two cases only appear for dark matter masses close to the inflationary scale. In addition, we identify a large region in parameter space in which cosmological production of dark matter is mostly independent of the chosen inflationary potential, highlighting the robustness of this dark matter production mechanism and its independence of the unknown particular details of inflation. In the region of masses lower than the scale of inflation, and sufficiently away from the conformal limit, the total comoving number density of produced particles becomes a function of the coupling to the geometry alone. This allows us to provide an approximated analytic expression for fitting the resulting abundance.</p>

<p>In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.</p>

<p>The Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has so far observed three classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor. Based on the observed line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of their member stars, we apply the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion modeling (JAM) approach to recover their inner dark matter distributions. In particular, both the traditional single-population Jeans model and the multiple population chemodynamical model are adopted. With the chemodynamical model, we divide member stars of each dSph into metal-rich and metal-poor populations. The metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated and dynamically colder, featuring lower velocity dispersion profiles than the metal-poor populations. We find a diversity of the inner density slopes $\gamma$ of dark matter halos, with the best constraints by single-population or chemodynamical models consistent with each other. The inner density slopes are $0.71^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$, $0.26^{+0.22}_{-0.12}$ and $0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor, respectively. We also present the measured astrophysical J and D factors of the three dSphs. Our results indicate that the study of the dark matter content of dSphs through stellar kinematics is still subject to uncertainties behind both the methodology and the observed data, through comparisons with previous measurements and data sets.</p>

<p>2025-07-03, <strong>Massive Interacting Binaries Enhance Feedback in Star-Forming Regions</strong>, Claude Cournoyer-Cloutier et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02780v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.02780v1</a></p>

<p>We present a new framework to incorporate feedback from massive interacting binaries in simulations of star cluster formation. Our new feedback model adds binary stellar evolution to the cluster formation code Torch, and couples it in AMUSE to the pre-existing modules for collisional stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and mechanical and radiative feedback. Our model accounts for the effects of mass transfer on the stars’ mass loss rates, their radiation spectra, and the timing of core-collapse supernovae. It also injects mass lost through non-conservative mass transfer and common envelope ejection into the interstellar medium. We demonstrate the use of our feedback model through simulations of isolated binaries in a gaseous medium, and of embedded clusters of massive binaries. Feedback from interacting binaries efficiently couples with the surrounding interstellar medium. It increases the size of HII regions, increases the kinetic and thermal energy of the gas, and increases the pressure within HII regions compared to models that use single star stellar evolution. Those differences arise from the ionizing radiation, which increases by three orders of magnitude, resulting in HII regions that expand due to thermal pressure rather than radiation pressure. The effects of stellar dynamics and the gravitational potential of the background gas cause the evolution of individual binaries to deviate from the predictions made by secular evolution, impacting the subsequent feedback from the binary. We conclude that massive interacting binaries are an important source of feedback in cluster-forming regions, and must be considered when studying the emerging timescales of young star clusters.</p>
