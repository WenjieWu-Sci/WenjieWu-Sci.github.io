<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Invariant amplitudes, unpolarized cross sections, and polarization asymmetries in (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering</strong>, Kaushik Borah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04687v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04687v1</a></p>

<p>At leading order in weak and electromagnetic couplings, cross sections for (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering are determined by four nucleon form factors that depend on the momentum transfer $Q^2$. Including radiative corrections in the Standard Model and potential new physics contributions beyond the Standard Model, eight invariant amplitudes are possible, depending on both $Q^2$ and the (anti)neutrino energy $E_\nu$. We review the definition of these amplitudes and use them to compute both unpolarized and polarized observables including radiative corrections. We show that unpolarized accelerator neutrino cross-section measurements can probe new physics parameter space within the constraints inferred from precision beta decay measurements.</p>

<p>We demonstrate that pairwise peculiar velocity correlations for galaxy clusters can be directly reconstructed from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (kSZ) signature imprinted in the CMB using a machine learning model with a gradient boosting algorithm trained on high-fidelity kSZ simulations. The machine learning model is trained using six to eight cluster features that are directly related to observables from CMB and large-scale structure surveys. We validate the capabilities of the approach in light of the presence of primary CMB, detector noise, and potential uncertainties in the cluster mass estimate and cluster center location. The pairwise velocity statistics extracted using the techniques developed here have the potential to elicit valuable cosmological constraints on dark energy, modified gravity models, and massive neutrinos with kSZ measurements from upcoming CMB surveys, including the Simons Observatory, CMB-S4 and CCAT, and the DESI and SDSS galaxy surveys.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Prospects for Heavy Neutral Lepton Searches at Short and Medium Baseline Reactor Experiments</strong>, N. van Remortel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04662v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04662v1</a></p>

<p>Heavy neutrinos with masses in the MeV range can in principle simultaneously explain the light neutrino masses and the origin of baryonic matter in the universe. The strongest constraints on their properties come from their potential impact on the formation of light elements in the early universe. Since these constraints rely on assumptions about the cosmic history, independent checks in the laboratory are highly desirable. In this paper, we discuss the opportunity to search for heavy neutrinos within the MeV mass range in short and medium baseline reactor neutrino experiments, using the SoLid, JUNO and TAO experiments as examples. This kind of experiments can give the currently strongest upper bound on the mixing between the light electron neutrinos and the heavy neutrino in the 2-9 MeV mass range.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Leptoquark-Mediated Two-Loop Neutrino Mass in Unified Theory</strong>, Kevin Hinze et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04644v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04644v1</a></p>

<p>Scalar leptoquarks naturally arise within unified theories, offering a promising avenue for addressing one of the most significant challenges of the Standard Model–the existence of non-zero neutrino masses. In this work, we present a unified theory based on the SU(5) gauge group, where neutrino mass appears at the two-loop level via the propagation of scalar leptoquarks. Due to the unified framework, the charged fermion and neutrino masses and mixings are entangled and determined by a common set of Yukawa couplings. These exotic particles not only shed light on the neutrino mass generation mechanism but also help achieve the unification of gauge couplings and are expected to lead to substantial lepton flavor violating rates, offering tangible opportunities for experimental verification. Reproducing the observed neutrino mass scale necessitates that leptoquarks reside a few orders of magnitude below the unification scale–a specific feature of the proposed scenario. Moreover, maximizing the unification scale implies TeV scale new physics states, making them accessible at colliders. The diverse roles that leptoquarks play highlight the elegance and predictive ability of the proposed unified model.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>$B$-meson production at forward rapidities in $pp$ collisions at the LHC: Estimating the intrinsic bottom contribution</strong>, Yuri N. Lima et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04619v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04619v1</a></p>

<p>The production of $B$ mesons at forward rapidities is strongly sensitive to the behavior of the gluon and bottom distribution functions for small and large values of the Bjorken-$x$ variable. In this exploratory study, we estimate the cross-section for the $B^{\pm}$ meson production in the kinematic range probed by the LHCb detector and that will be analyzed by the future Forward Physics Facility (FPF) considering the hybrid formalism, the solution of the running coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov equation and distinct description of the bottom distribution function. We assume an ansatz for the intrinsic bottom component in the proton wave function, and estimate its impact on the transverse momentum, rapidity and Feynman-$x$ distributions. Our results indicate that the presence of an intrinsic bottom strongly modifies the magnitude of the cross-section at ultra-forward rapidities ($y \ge 6$), which implies an enhancement of the $B^{\pm}$ production at the FPF. Possible implications on the prompt neutrino flux at ultra-high energies are also briefly discussed.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Search for long-lived heavy neutrinos in the decays of B mesons produced in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</strong>, CMS Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04584v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04584v1</a></p>

<p>A search for long-lived heavy neutrinos (N) in the decays of \PB mesons produced in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV is presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 41.6 fb$^{-1}$ collected in 2018 by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, using a dedicated data stream that enhances the number of recorded events containing B mesons. The search probes heavy neutrinos with masses in the range 1 $\lt$ $m_\mathrm{N}$ $\lt$ 3 GeV and decay lengths in the range 10$^{-2}$ $\lt$ $c\tau$ $\lt$ 10$^{4}$ mm, where $\tau_\mathrm{N}$ is the N proper mean lifetime. Signal events are defined by the signature B $\to$ $\ell_\mathrm{B}$NX; N $\to$ $\ell^{\pm} \pi^{\mp}$, where the leptons $\ell_\mathrm{B}$ and $\ell$ can be either a muon or an electron, provided that at least one of them is a muon. The hadronic recoil system, X, is treated inclusively and is not reconstructed. No significant excess of events over the standard model background is observed in any of the $\ell^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ invariant mass distributions. Limits at 95% confidence level on the sum of the squares of the mixing amplitudes between heavy and light neutrinos, $\vert V_\mathrm{N}\vert^2$, and on $c\tau$ are obtained in different mixing scenarios for both Majorana and Dirac-like N particles. The most stringent upper limit $\vert V_\mathrm{N}\vert^2$ $\lt$ 2.0$\times$10$^{-5}$ is obtained at $m_\mathrm{N}$ = 1.95 GeV for the Majorana case where N mixes exclusively with muon neutrinos. The limits on $\vert V_\mathrm{N}\vert^2$ for masses 1 $\lt$ $m_\mathrm{N}$ $\lt$ 1.7 GeV are the most stringent from a collider experiment to date.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Emission lines due to ionizing radiation from a compact object in the remnant of Supernova 1987A</strong>, C. Fransson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04386v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04386v1</a></p>

<p>The nearby Supernova 1987A was accompanied by a burst of neutrino emission, which indicates that a compact object (a neutron star or black hole) was formed in the explosion. There has been no direct observation of this compact object. In this work, we observe the supernova remnant with JWST spectroscopy finding narrow infrared emission lines of argon and sulphur. The line emission is spatially unresolved and blueshifted in velocity relative to the supernova rest frame. We interpret the lines as gas illuminated by a source of ionizing photons located close to the center of the expanding ejecta. Photoionization models show that the line ratios are consistent with ionization by a cooling neutron star or pulsar wind nebula. The velocity shift could be evidence for a neutron star natal kick.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Probing the mixing between sterile and tau neutrinos in the SHiP experiment</strong>, Ki-Young Choi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04191v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04191v1</a></p>

<p>We study the expected sensitivity to the mixing between sterile and tau neutrinos directly from the tau neutrino disappearance in the high-energy fixed target experiment. Here, the beam energy is large enough to produce tau neutrinos at the target with large luminosity. During their propagation to the detector, the tau neutrino may oscillate into sterile neutrino. By examining the energy spectrum of the observed tau neutrino events, we can probe the mixing between sterile and tau neutrinos directly. In this paper, we consider Scattering and Neutrino Detector (SND) at SHiP experiment as a showcase, which uses 400 GeV protons from SPS at CERN, and expect to observe 6,300 tau and anti-tau neutrinos from the $2\times 10^{20}$ POT for 5 years operation. Assuming the uncertainty of 10\%, we find the sensitivity $|U_{\tau 4}|^2 \sim 0.08$\, (90\% CL) for $\Delta m_{41}^2 \sim 500\ \mathrm{eV}^2$ with 10\% signal-to-background ratio. We also consider a far SND at the end of the SHiP hidden sector detector, in which case the sensitivity would be enhanced to $|U_{\tau 4}|^2 \sim 0.02$.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Impacts of source morphology on the detectability of subhalos in strong lenses</strong>, Tyler J. Hughes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04349v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04349v1</a></p>

<p>We provide an analysis of a convolutional neural network’s ability to identify the lensing signal of single dark matter subhalos in strong galaxy-galaxy lenses in the presence of increasingly complex source light morphology. We simulate a balanced dataset of 800,000 strong lens images both perturbed and unperturbed by a single subhalo ranging in virial mass between $10^{7.5} M_{\odot} - 10^{11}M_{\odot}$ and characterise the source complexity by the number of Sersic clumps present in the source plane ranging from 1 to 5. Using the ResNet50 architecture we train the network to classify images as either perturbed or unperturbed. We find that the network is able to detect subhalos at low enough masses to distinguish between dark matter models even with complex sources and that source complexity has little impact on the accuracy beyond 3 clumps. The model was more confident in its classification when the clumps in the source were compact, but cared little about their spatial distribution. We also tested for the resolution of the data, finding that even in conditions akin to natural seeing the model was still able to achieve an accuracy of 74% in our highest peak signal-to-noise datasets, though this is heavily dominated by the high mass subhalos. It’s robustness against resolution is attributed to the model learning the flux ratio anomalies in the perturbed lenses which are conserved in the lower resolution data.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Signal Response Model in PandaX-4T</strong>, Yunyang Luo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04239v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04239v1</a></p>

<p>PandaX-4T experiment is a deep-underground dark matter direct search experiment that employs a dual-phase time projection chamber with a sensitive volume containing 3.7 tonne of liquid xenon. The detector of PandaX-4T is capable of simultaneously collecting the primary scintillation and ionization signals, utilizing their ratio to discriminate dark matter signals from background sources such as gamma rays and beta particles. The signal response model plays a crucial role in interpreting the data obtained by PandaX-4T. It describes the conversion from the deposited energy by dark matter interactions to the detectable signals within the detector. The signal response model is utilized in various PandaX-4T results. This work provides a comprehensive description of the procedures involved in constructing and parameter-fitting the signal response model for the energy range of approximately 1 keV to 25 keV for electronic recoils and 6 keV to 90 keV for nuclear recoils. It also covers the signal reconstruction, selection, and correction methods, which are crucial components integrated into the signal response model.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Accreting Primordial Black Holes: Dark Matter Constituents</strong>, Brandon Curd et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04227v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04227v1</a></p>

<p>This paper shows that accretion of positronium plasma between 0.01 to 14s after the Big Bang could have created small black holes contributing at least 1 percent of the dark matter present today, with uncertainties ranging from 10 percent or more. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations newly adapted to the early Universe confirm that accretion is due to magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in a rotating plasma. By contrast with Bondi accretion producing primordial masses bigger than the Sun, MRI could produce masses 10^{15-18} g observable by their Hawking radiation contributing to background gamma rays.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Sliding into DM: Determining the local dark matter density and speed distribution using only the local circular speed of the Galaxy</strong>, Patrick G. Staudt et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04122v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04122v1</a></p>

<p>We use FIRE-2 zoom simulations of Milky Way size disk galaxies to derive easy-to-use relationships between the observed circular speed of the Galaxy at the Solar location, $v_\mathrm{c}$, and dark matter properties of relevance for direct detection experiments: the dark matter density, the dark matter velocity dispersion, and the speed distribution of dark matter particles near the Solar location. We find that both the local dark matter density and 3D velocity dispersion follow tight power laws with $v_\mathrm{c}$. Using this relation together with the observed circular speed of the Milky Way at the Solar radius, we infer the local dark matter density and velocity dispersion near the Sun to be $\rho = 0.42\pm 0.06\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{3D} = 280^{+19}_{-18}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. We also find that the distribution of dark matter particle speeds is well-described by a modified Maxwellian with two shape parameters, both of which correlate with the observed $v_{\rm c}$. We use that modified Maxwellian to predict the speed distribution of dark matter near the Sun and find that it peaks at a most probable speed of $250\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and begins to truncate sharply above $470\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. This peak speed is somewhat higher than expected from the standard halo model, and the truncation occurs well below the formal escape speed to infinity, with fewer very-high-speed particles than assumed in the standard halo model.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Contribution of Population III Stars to Merging Binary Black Holes</strong>, Ataru Tanikawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04389v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04389v1</a></p>

<p>A large number of mergers of binary black holes (BHs) have been discovered by gravitational wave observations since the first detection of gravitational waves 2015. Binary BH mergers are the loudest events in the universe, however their origin(s) have been under debate. There have been many suggestions for merging binary BHs. Isolated binary stars are one of the most promising origins. We have investigated the evolution of isolated binary stars ranging from zero metallicity (Population III stars or Pop III stars) to the solar metallicity by means of so-called rapid binary population synthesis simulation. We have found that binary BHs formed from isolated binary stars reproduce the redshift evolution of the merger rate density and the distribution of primary BH masses and mass ratios inferred by Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3). Pop III stars have a crucial role in forming merging binary BHs in so-called the pair instability mass gap. Note that we choose the conventional prescription of pair instability mass loss, based on the standard $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate. Finally, we have shown the redshift evolution of the rate density of pair instability supernovae, and have predicted that a few pair instability supernovae would be discovered in the next few years. The discoveries would validate our results of merging binary BHs.</p>

<p>2024-03-07, <strong>Destratification in the Progenitor Interior of the Mg-rich Supernova Remnant N49B</strong>, Toshiki Sato et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04156v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.04156v1</a></p>

<p>Simulations of pre-supernova evolution suggest that some intense shell burning can be so active that, in extreme cases, it can merge with the outer shell, changing the initial conditions for the supernova explosion. However, such violent activity in the interior of stars has been difficult to confirm from observations of stars. Here we propose that the elemental composition of O-rich ejecta in supernova remnants can be a tool to test for this kind of intense shell burning activity in the final stages of progenitor evolution. As an example, we discuss the origin of “Mg-rich” ejecta in the supernova remnant N49B. A high Mg/Ne mass ratio $\gtrsim 1$ suggests that the Ne- or O-burning shell has broken into or merged with the outer shell before the collapse. Such Mg-rich (or Ne-poor) ejecta has been identified in some other supernova remnants, supporting the idea that some destratification process, such as a shell merger, does indeed occur in the interiors of some massive stars, although they may not be the majority. Our results suggest that X-ray observations of O-rich ejecta in core-collapse supernova remnants will be a unique tool to probe the shell burning activity during the final stage of a massive star’s interior.</p>
