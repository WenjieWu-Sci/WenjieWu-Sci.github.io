<p>2023-09-11, <strong>The role of de-excitation in the final-state interactions of protons in neutrino-nucleus interactions</strong>, Anna Ershova et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05410v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05410v1</a></p>

<p>Present and next generation of long-baseline accelerator experiments are bringing the measurement of neutrino oscillations into the precision era with ever-increasing statistics. One of the most challenging aspects of achieving such measurements is developing relevant systematic uncertainties in the modeling of nuclear effects in neutrino-nucleus interactions. To address this problem, state-of-the-art detectors are being developed to extract detailed information about all particles produced in neutrino interactions. To fully profit from these experimental advancements, it is essential to have reliable models of propagation of the outgoing hadrons through nuclear matter able to predict how the energy is distributed between all the final-state observed particles. In this article, we investigate the role of nuclear de-excitation in neutrino-nucleus scattering using two Monte Carlo cascade models: NuWro and INCL coupled with the de-excitation code ABLA. The ablation model ABLA is used here for the first time to model de-excitation in neutrino interactions. As input to ABLA, we develop a consistent simulation of nuclear excitation energy tuned to electron-scattering data. The paper includes the characterization of the leading proton kinematics and of the nuclear cluster production during cascade and de-excitation. The observability of nuclear clusters as vertex activity and their role in a precise neutrino energy reconstruction is quantified.</p>

<p>2023-09-10, <strong>Three-dimensional GRMHD Simulations of Rapidly Rotating Stellar Core-Collapse</strong>, Shota Shibagaki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05161v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05161v1</a></p>

<p>We present results from fully general relativistic (GR), three-dimensional (3D), neutrino-radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of stellar core collapse of a 20 M$_\odot$ star with spectral neutrino transport. Our focus is to study the gravitational-wave (GW) signatures from the magnetorotationally (MR)-driven models. By parametrically changing the initial angular velocity and the strength of the magnetic fields in the core, we compute four models. Our results show that the MHD outflows are produced only for models (two out of four), to which rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields are initially imposed. Seen from the direction perpendicular to the rotational axis, a characteristic waveform is obtained exhibiting a monotonic time increase in the wave amplitude. As previously identified, this stems from the propagating MHD outflows along the axis. We show that the GW amplitude from anisotropic neutrino emission becomes more than one order-of-magnitude bigger than that from the matter contribution, whereas seen from the rotational axis, both of the two components are in the same order-of-magnitudes. Due to the memory effect, the frequency of the neutrino GW from our full-fledged 3D-MHD models is in the range less than $\sim$10Hz. Toward the future GW detection for a Galactic core-collapse supernova, if driven by the MR mechanism, the planned next-generation detector as DECIGO is urgently needed to catch the low-frequency signals.</p>

<p>2023-09-10, <strong>Z’ Mediated right-handed Neutrinos from Meson Decays at the FASER</strong>, Jiale Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05020v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05020v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the pair production of right-handed neutrinos mediated by a $Z^\prime$ from the meson decays at the FASER detector of the HL-LHC. The $Z^\prime$ can be either the additional gauge boson in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ or sterile $\nu$-specific $U(1)_s$ model. Taking the gauge coupling or the kinetic mixing at the current limits, we analyses the sensitivity to the masses of the heavy neutrinos, $m_N$, and active-sterile mixing, $V_{lN}^2$, of the FASER-2. In a background free scenario, FASER-2 is able to probe $V_{lN}^2 \approx 10^{-8}$ when $m_N \sim 0.2$ GeV, which is comparable to the current limits from the beam dump experiments for the right-handed neutrinos dominantly coupled to electron and muon flavours, and exceed three magnitude for tau. When comes to the $U(1)_s$ model, FASER-2 can probe $V_{lN}^2 \approx 10^{-10}$, which is better than the current limits in all three flavours. A proposed long-lived particle detector, FACET, is also studied, while no significant difference from FASER-2 is derived.</p>

<p>2023-09-11, <strong>Progress in Direct Measurements of the Hubble Constant</strong>, Wendy L. Freedman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05618v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05618v1</a></p>

<p>One of the most exciting and pressing issues in cosmology today is the discrepancy between some measurements of the local Hubble constant and other values of the expansion rate inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Resolving these differences holds the potential for the discovery of new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology: Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM), a successful model that has been in place for more than 20 years. Given both the fundamental significance of this outstanding discrepancy, and the many-decades-long effort to increase the accuracy of the extragalactic distance scale, it is critical to demonstrate that the local measurements are convincingly free from residual systematic errors. We review the progress over the past quarter century in measurements of the local value of the Hubble constant, and discuss remaining challenges. Particularly exciting are new data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), that is delivering high-resolution near-infrared imaging data to both test for and to address directly several of the systematic uncertainties that have historically limited the accuracy of extragalactic distance scale. We present an overview of our new JWST program to observe Cepheids, TRGB and JAGB stars. For the first galaxy in our program, NGC 7250, the high-resolution JWST images demonstrate that many of the Cepheids observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are significantly crowded by nearby neighbors. Avoiding the more significantly crowded variables, the scatter in the JWST near-infrared (NIR) Cepheid period-luminosity relation is decreased by a factor of two compared to those from HST, illustrating the power of JWST for improvements to local measurements of Ho. Ultimately, these data will either confirm the standard model, or provide robust evidence for the inclusion of additional new physics.</p>

<p>2023-09-11, <strong>Light Dark Matter in a Blazar-heated Universe</strong>, Oindrila Ghosh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05421v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05421v1</a></p>

<p>Prompt emissions from TeV blazars pair produce off the extragalactic background light and the highly energetic resulting pair beams then cascade through inverse Compton scattering to give rise to secondary gamma-rays. Such reprocessed cascade emission that can be associated with individual blazar sources has not been detected thus far. The absence of pair halos around these sources, along with the non-observation of isotropic gamma-ray background excess, seems to suggest that collective plasma effects, such as beam-plasma instabilities, can play a crucial role in alleviating this GeV-TeV tension by transferring the energy from the pair beams into the background plasma of the intergalactic medium (IGM). This has profound implications not only for TeV astrophysics, but also the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field and properties of dark matter (DM). A direct consequence of the instability losses and IGM heating is the modification of thermal history at late times, which suppresses structure formation particularly in baryonically underdense regions, potentially holding a clue towards resolving the small-scale crisis in cosmology. In a blazar-heated universe, the observation of dwarf galaxies and Lyman-$\alpha$ measurements present a favoured mass range for DM candidates such as light axion-like particles.</p>

<p>2023-09-11, <strong>A severe challenge to the MOND phenomenology in our Galaxy</strong>, Man Ho Chan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05252v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05252v1</a></p>

<p>Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is one of the most popular alternative theories of dark matter to explain the missing mass problem in galaxies. Although it remains controversial regarding MOND as a fundamental theory, MOND phenomenology has been shown to widely apply in different galaxies, which gives challenges to the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model. In this article, we derive analytically the galactic rotation curve gradient in the MOND framework and present a rigorous analysis to examine the MOND phenomenology in our Galaxy. By assuming a benchmark baryonic disk density profile and two popular families of MOND interpolating functions, we show for the first time that the recent discovery of the declining Galactic rotation curve in the outer region ($R \approx 17-23$ kpc) can almost rule out the MOND phenomenology at more than $5\sigma$. This strongly supports some of the previous studies claiming that MOND is neither a fundamental theory nor a universal description of galactic properties.</p>

<p>2023-09-10, <strong>Topological Dark Matter in LIGO Data</strong>, Lavinia Heisenberg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05093v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05093v1</a></p>

<p>In the efforts of searching for dark matter, gravitational wave interferometers have been recently proposed as a promising probe. These highly sensitive instruments are potentially be able to detect the interactions of dark matter with the detectors. In this work, we explored the possibilities of discovering topological dark matter with LIGO detectors. We analyzed domain walls consisting of axion-like dark matter passing through Earth, leaving traces in multiple detectors simultaneously. Considering dark matter interactions with the light in the interferometer and with the beamsplitter, we performed the first analysis of the topological dark matter with the gravitational-wave strain data. We examined whether astrophysically unexpected triggers could be explained by domain wall passages. We found that all of the binary black hole mergers we analyzed favored the binary black hole merger hypothesis rather than the domain wall hypothesis, with the closest being GW190521. Moreover we found that some of topological dark matter signals can be caught by binary black hole searches. Finally, we found that glitches in the data can inevitably limit the dark matter searches for certain parameters. These results are expected to guide the future searches and analyses.</p>

<p>2023-09-10, <strong>Equation of spin motion for a particle with electric and magnetic charges and dipole moments</strong>, Alexander J. Silenko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04985v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.04985v1</a></p>

<p>The general classical equation of spin motion is rigorously derived for a particle with electric and magnetic charges and dipole moments in electromagnetic fields. The equation describing the spin motion relative to the momentum direction in storage rings is also obtained. The importance of the derivation follows from a possible appearance of magnetic charges and EDMs due to the pseudoscalar \emph{CP}-violating electromagnetic interaction caused by dark matter axions.</p>

<p>2023-09-11, <strong>Amalgame: Cosmological Constraints from the First Combined Photometric Supernova Sample</strong>, Brodie Popovic et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05654v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05654v1</a></p>

<p>Future constraints of cosmological parameters from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) will depend on the use of photometric samples, those samples without spectroscopic measurements of the SNe Ia. There is a growing number of analyses that show that photometric samples can be utilised for precision cosmological studies with minimal systematic uncertainties. To investigate this claim, we perform the first analysis that combines two separate photometric samples, SDSS and Pan-STARRS, without including a low-redshift anchor. We evaluate the consistency of the cosmological parameters from these two samples and find they are consistent with each other to under $1\sigma$. From the combined sample, named Amalgame, we measure $\Omega_M = 0.328 \pm 0.024$ with SN alone in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $\Omega_M = 0.330 \pm 0.018$ and $w = -1.016^{+0.055}_{-0.058}$ when combining with a Planck data prior and a flat $w$CDM model. These results are consistent with constraints from the Pantheon+ analysis of only spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia, and show that there are no significant impediments to analyses of purely photometric samples of SNe Ia.</p>

<p>2023-09-11, <strong>Implications for the Explosion Mechanism of Type Ia Supernovae from their Late-time Spectra</strong>, Jialian Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05538v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05538v1</a></p>

<p>Late-time spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are important in clarifying the physics of their explosions, as they provide key clues to the inner structure of the exploding white dwarfs. We examined late-time optical spectra of 36 SNe Ia, including five from our own project (SNe 2019np, 2019ein, 2021hpr, 2021wuf, and 2022hrs), with phase coverage of $\sim 200$ to $\sim 400$ days after maximum light. At this late phase, the outer ejecta have become transparent and the features of inner iron-group elements emerge in the spectra. Based on multicomponent Gaussian fits and reasonable choices for the pseudocontinuum around Ni and Fe emission features, we get reliable estimates of the Ni to Fe ratio, which is sensitive to the explosion models of SNe Ia. Our results show that the majority (about 67%) of our SNe Ia are more consistent with the sub-Chandrasekhar-mass (i.e., double-detonation) model, although they could be affected by evolutionary or ionisation effects. Moreover, we find that the Si II $\lambda$6355 velocity measured around the time of maximum light tends to increase with the Ni to Fe ratio for the subsample with either redshifted or blueshifted nebular velocities, suggesting that progenitor metallicity might play an important role in accounting for the observed velocity diversity of SNe Ia.</p>

<p>2023-09-11, <strong>Diagnosis of Circumstellar Matter Structure in Type IIn Supernovae with Hydrogen Line Feature</strong>, Ayako T. Ishii et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05344v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05344v1</a></p>

<p>Some supernovae (SNe), such as Type IIn SNe, are powered by collision of the SN ejecta with a dense circumstellar matter (CSM). Their emission spectra show characteristic line shapes of combined broad emission and narrow P-Cyg lines, which should closely relate to the CSM structure and the mass-loss mechanism that creates the dense CSM. We quantitatively investigate the relationship between the line shape and the CSM structure by Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, considering two representative cases of dense CSM formed by steady and eruptive mass loss. Comparing the H$\alpha$ emission between the two cases, we find that a narrow P-Cyg line appears in the eruptive case while it does not appear in the steady case, due to the difference in the velocity gradient in the dense CSM. We also reproduce the blue-shifted photon excess observed in some SNe IIn, which is formed by photon transport across the shock wave and find the relationship between the velocity of the shocked matter and the amount of the blue shift of the photon excess. We conclude that the presence or absence of narrow P-Cyg lines can distinguish the mass loss mechanism, and suggest high-resolution spectroscopic observations with $\lambda/ \Delta \lambda \gtrsim 10^4$ after the light curve peak for applying this diagnostic method.</p>

<p>2023-09-10, <strong>The carbon-rich type Ic supernova 2016adj in the iconic dust lane of Centaurus A: signatures of interaction with circumstellar hydrogen?</strong>, Maximilian D. Stritzinger et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05031v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05031v1</a></p>

<p>We present a comprehensive data set of supernova (SN) 2016adj located within the central dust lane of Centaurus A. SN 2016adj is significantly reddened and after correcting the peak apparent $B$-band magnitude ($m_B = 17.48\pm0.05$) for Milky Way reddening and our inferred host-galaxy reddening parameters (i.e., $R_{V}^{host} = 5.7\pm0.7$ and $A_{V}^{host} = 6.3\pm0.2$), we estimate it reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B \sim -18$. Detailed inspection of the optical/NIR spectroscopic time-series reveals a carbon-rich SN Ic and not a SN Ib/IIb as previously suggested in the literature. The NIR spectra shows prevalent carbon-monoxide formation occurring already by +41 days past $B$-band maximum, which is $\approx 11$ days earlier than previously reported in the literature for this object. Interestingly around two months past maximum, the NIR spectrum of SN~2016adj begins to exhibit H features, with a +97~d medium resolution spectrum revealing both Paschen and Bracket lines with absorption minima of $\sim 2000$ km/s, full-width-half-maximum emission velocities of $\sim 1000$ km/s, and emission line ratios consistent with a dense emission region. We speculate these attributes are due to circumstellar interaction (CSI) between the rapidly expanding SN ejecta and a H-rich shell of material formed during the pre-SN phase. A bolometric light curve is constructed and a semi-analytical model fit suggests the supernova synthesized 0.5 solar masses of $^{56}$Ni and ejected 4.2 solar masses of material, though these values should be approached with caution given the large uncertainties associated with the adopted reddening parameters, possible CSI contamination, and known light echo emission. Finally, inspection of Hubble Space Telescope archival data yielded no progenitor detection.</p>
