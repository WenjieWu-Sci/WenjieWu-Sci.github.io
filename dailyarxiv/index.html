<p>2025-06-03, <strong>Loop-corrected Trilinear Higgs Self-Couplings in the NMSSM with Inverse Seesaw Mechanism</strong>, Thi Nhung Dao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02743v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.02743v1</a></p>

<p>The higher-order corrections for the SM-like Higgs boson mass and the trilinear Higgs self-couplings in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (NMSSM) with Inverse Seesaw Mechanism are significant and highly correlated. We present here the full one-loop corrections to the trilinear Higgs self-couplings supplemented by the dominant top-Yukawa and strong coupling induced two-loop corrections from our previous calculations in the complex NMSSM. These corrections are performed consistently with the corresponding Higgs boson mass corrections. We discuss in detail the new effects from the extended neutrino and sneutrino sectors on both the trilinear Higgs self-couplings and the SM-like Higgs boson mass. When compared to the case of the NMSSM without Inverse Seesaw Mechanism, the new effects can be up to 10\% for the effective SM-like trilinear Higgs self-couplings, and up to 4.5\% for the SM-like Higgs boson mass for valid parameter points, i.e. points satisfying the Higgs data, the neutrino data, the constraints from the charged lepton flavor-violating decays, and the new physics constraints from the oblique parameters $S, T, U$. The new corrections are also included in the Higgs-to-Higgs decays for the heavy Higgs states and implemented in the new version of the Fortran code NMSSMCALC-nuSS.</p>

<p>2025-06-03, <strong>Neutrino mass model at a three-loop level from a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry</strong>, Takaaki Nomura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02639v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.02639v1</a></p>

<p>We study a three-loop induced neutrino mass scenario from a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ flavor symmetry and reach the minimum scenario leading predictions of the lepton masses, mixing angles, and Dirac and Majorana phases, which are shown through the chi square analyses. In addition, we discuss the lepton flavor violations, muon anomalous magnetic moment, lepton universality, and relic density of the dark matter candidate. And, we find that we need to extend our model if we satisfy the observed relic density of dark matter within the limit of perturbation where it can be done by adding one singlet scalar boson without changing predictions in neutrino sector.</p>

<p>2025-06-03, <strong>Correlating lepton flavour violating $b \to s$ and leptonic decay modes in a minimal abelian extension of the Standard Model</strong>, Pietro Colangelo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02552v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.02552v1</a></p>

<p>We consider an abelian extension of the Standard Model (SM) comprising a new gauge group $U(1)^\prime$, with the neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$ having flavour violating couplings to quarks and leptons. The fermion content is the same as in SM except for the addition of three right-handed neutrinos. The model describes the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to fermions in terms of three rational parameters $\epsilon_{1,2,3}$ that sum to zero imposing the cancellation of the gauge anomalies. Each $\epsilon_i$ is common to all fermions in a generation, a feature producing correlations among quark and lepton observables. We focus on $b \to s \ell_1^- \ell_2^+$ transitions for the lepton flavour conserving $\ell_1=\ell_2$ and lepton flavour violating case $\ell_1 \neq \ell_2$. Small deviations with respect to the SM predictions are found in the first case, which reflects a feature of the model where quark and lepton sectors prevent each other to manifest large discrepancies with respect to SM. We investigate the correlations with the flavour violating leptonic decays $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$, $\tau^- \to \mu^- \mu^+ \mu^-$. The experimental upper bound on the branching ratio of $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$ constrains the range for the lepton flavour violating $B_{d,s}$ decays, which however are predicted to be within the reach of the planned new facilities.</p>

<p>2025-06-02, <strong>A Bayesian PINN Framework for Barrow-Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy with Neutrinos: Toward a Resolution of the Hubble Tension</strong>, Muhammad Yarahmadi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02235v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.02235v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the Barrow-Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (BTHDE) model using both traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework, employing a range of cosmological observations. Our analysis incorporates data from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), CMB lensing, Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation. We focus on constraining the Hubble constant $ H_0 $, the nonextensive entropy index $ q $, the Barrow exponent $ \Delta $, and the Granda-Oliveros parameters $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $, along with the total neutrino mass $ \Sigma m_\nu $. The Bayesian PINN approach yields more precise constraints than MCMC, particularly for $ \beta $, and tighter upper bounds on $ \Sigma m_\nu $. The inferred values of $ H_0 $ from both methods lie between those from Planck 2018 and SH$_0$ES (R22), alleviating the Hubble tension to within $ 1.3\sigma $-$2.1\sigma $ depending on the dataset combination. Notably, the Bayesian PINN achieves consistent results across CC and Pantheon+ datasets, while maintaining physical consistency via embedded differential constraints. The combination of CMB and late-time probes leads to the most stringent constraints, with $ \Sigma m_\nu &lt; 0.114 $ eV and $ H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.35 $ km/s/Mpc. These findings suggest that the BTHDE model provides a viable framework for addressing cosmological tensions and probing modified entropy scenarios, while highlighting the complementary strengths of machine learning and traditional Bayesian inference in cosmological modeling.</p>

<p>2025-06-02, <strong>Rapid and accurate numerical evolution of linear cosmological perturbations with non-cold relics</strong>, Nanoom Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01956v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.01956v1</a></p>

<p>We describe the implementation of a new approach to the numerical evaluation of the effects of non-cold relics on the evolution of cosmological perturbations. The Boltzmann hierarchies used to compute the contributions of these relics to the stress-energy tensor are replaced with a set of integral equations. These integral equations take the form of convolutions and are solved iteratively with the rest of the system. We develop efficient algorithms for evaluating these convolutions using non-uniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFTs). This approach enables efficient and accurate evaluation of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and matter power spectra, all the way through the history of the Universe, without relying on semi-analytic approximations at late times. We implement this method in the Boltzmann solver CLASS, resulting in a new code called CLASSIER (for CLASS Integral Equation Revision), and apply it to massive-neutrino perturbations as a demonstration. The implementation is optimized to accurately capture the distinct behaviors of perturbations in both super-/near-horizon and sub-horizon regimes. Our results match the accuracy of a fully converged Boltzmann hierarchy solution while avoiding numerical artifacts from truncation of the Boltzmann hierarchy at finite multipole and offering substantial speedups depending on the required precision and the range of scales of interest. This new framework provides a practical and robust alternative for the truncated Boltzmann hierarchy approach, especially for studying beyond $\Lambda$CDM non-cold relics with signatures on small scales. CLASSIER is publicly available at https://github.com/nanoomlee/CLASSIER.</p>

<p>2025-06-02, <strong>Neutrino pair annihilation driven jets from black-hole torus systems</strong>, Kyohei Kawaguchi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01679v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.01679v1</a></p>

<p>We perform axisymmetric general relativistic radiation-viscous hydrodynamics simulations of black hole (BH)-torus systems with full Boltzmann Monte-Carlo neutrino transport to investigate the role of neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation in launching relativistic outflows. Our models span a wide range of BH spins, torus masses, and viscosity parameters. We find that the pair annihilation leads to the formation of relativistic fireballs in most cases, except for those with low black-hole spin and high viscosity. The isotropic-equivalent energies of these outflows reach $\lesssim 10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$ with durations $\lesssim 0.2\,{\rm s}$. While this is insufficient to explain the brightest short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), our results suggest that the pair annihilation may account for some low-luminosity sGRBs and GRB precursors. We also provide updated scaling relations for the pair annihilation energy deposition rate as a function of accretion rate, and discuss the sensitivity of outflow properties to numerical resolution and floor density.</p>

<p>2025-06-03, <strong>A Fuzzy Situation Eased: Cold Dark Matter with Multipoles Can Explain The Double Radio Quad Lens HS 0810+2554</strong>, John H. Miller Jr et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03132v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.03132v1</a></p>

<p>Originally observed in isophotal density contours of elliptical galaxies, higher order perturbations in the form of Fourier modes, or multipoles, are becoming increasingly recognized as necessary to account for angular mass complexity in strong lensing analyses. When smooth, elliptical CDM mass models fail, multipoles often emerge as solutions. With the discovery of two radio jets in the source quasar, the strong gravitational lens HS 0810+2554 can no longer be well fit by elliptical mass models, suggesting perturbations on small-scales. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of multipoles $m=1$ (lopsidedness), $m=3$ (triangleness), and $m=4$ (boxiness and diskiness) in addressing the image positional anomalies of the two radio quads of HS 0810+2554. Due to the exact pairing and arrival sequence of the images being unknown, we consider all feasible image configurations. With 64 unique best-fit models, we achieve a fit of $\chi=1.59$ ($\chi^2=2.53$), with $m=1,3,4$ multipole strengths of 0.9%, 0.4%, and 0.6%, respectively, with images in the reverse time ordering. Elliptical+shear models from previous works find $\chi!\sim!7!-!10$, for comparison. With the morphological (i.e., standard) arrival sequence, we achieve a fit of $\chi=2.95$ with two images being assigned to opposite sources. Therefore, CDM mass models with mass complexity in the form of multipoles are able to adequately explain the positional anomalies in HS 0810+2554. Alternative dark matter theories, like fuzzy dark matter, need not be invoked.</p>

<p>2025-06-03, <strong>Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-PÃ©rot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter Detection</strong>, Jacob Egge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03091v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.03091v1</a></p>

<p>Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-P'erot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.</p>

<p>2025-06-03, <strong>TDCOSMO 2025: Cosmological constraints from strong lensing time delays</strong>, Simon Birrer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03023v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.03023v1</a></p>

<p>We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars (hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectorsâ mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with $\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM), we find $H_0=72.1^{+4.0}_{-3.7}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on $H_0$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM to 4.4%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\phi}$CDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO $H_0$ inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.</p>

<p>2025-06-03, <strong>SPINN: Advancing Cosmological Simulations of Fuzzy Dark Matter with Physics Informed Neural Networks</strong>, Ashutosh Kumar Mishra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02957v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.02957v1</a></p>

<p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving differential equations by integrating physical laws into the learning process. This work leverages PINNs to simulate gravitational collapse, a critical phenomenon in astrophysics and cosmology. We introduce the Schr"odinger-Poisson informed neural network (SPINN) which solve nonlinear Schr"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations to simulate the gravitational collapse of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) in both 1D and 3D settings. Results demonstrate accurate predictions of key metrics such as mass conservation, density profiles, and structure suppression, validating against known analytical or numerical benchmarks. This work highlights the potential of PINNs for efficient, possibly scalable modeling of FDM and other astrophysical systems, overcoming the challenges faced by traditional numerical solvers due to the non-linearity of the involved equations and the necessity to resolve multi-scale phenomena especially resolving the fine wave features of FDM on cosmological scales.</p>

<p>2025-06-03, <strong>Local dark matter density from Gaia DR3 K-dwarfs using Gaussian processes</strong>, Laurin SÃ¶ding et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02956v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.02956v1</a></p>

<p>Modern astrophysical surveys have produced a wealth of data on the positions and velocities of stars in the Milky Way with varying accuracies. An ever-increasing detail in observational data calls for more complex physical models and in turn more sophisticated statistical methods to extract information. We perform a vertical Jeans analysis, including a local approximation of the tilt term, using a sample of $200\,000$ K-dwarf stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue. After combination with the Survey-of-Surveys (SoS) catalogue, $160\,888$ of those have radial velocity measurements. We use Gaussian processes as priors for the covariance matrix of radial and vertical velocities. Joint inference of the posterior distribution of the local dark matter density and the velocity moments is performed using geometric variational inference. We find a local dark matter density of ${\rho_\mathrm{dm} = 0.0131 \pm 0.0041\, \mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3} = 0.50 \pm 0.15\, \mathrm{GeV}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}$ at the Sunâs position, which is in agreement with most other recent analyses. By comparing a ($z$-dependent) Gaussian process prior with a ($z$-independent) scalar prior for the tilt term, we quantify its impact on estimates of the local dark matter density and argue that careful modelling is required to mitigate systematic biases.</p>

<p>2025-06-03, <strong>Probing Dark Matter Spike with Gravitational Waves from Early EMRIs in the Milky Way Center</strong>, Chen Feng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02937v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.02937v1</a></p>

<p>Cold dark matter may form dense structures around supermassive black holes (SMBHs), significantly influencing their local environments. These dense regions are ideal sites for the formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which stellar-mass compact objects gradually spiral into SMBH, emitting gravitational waves (GWs). Space-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories such as LISA and Taiji will be sensitive to these signals, including early-stage EMRIs (E-EMRIs) that persist in the low-frequency band for extended periods. In this work, we investigate the impact of dark matter-induced dynamical friction on E-EMRIs in the Milky Way Center, model its effect on the trajectory, and calculate the resulting modifications to the GW spectrum. Our analysis suggests that this influence might be sizable and lead to detectable deviations in the spectrum, namely suppression at low frequencies and enhancement at high frequencies, therefore providing a potential probe for dark matter with future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.</p>

<p>2025-06-03, <strong>Active galactic nuclei through the prism of galaxy clusters: bounds on axion-like particles</strong>, Denys Malyshev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02848v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.02848v1</a></p>

<p>Hypothetical axion-like particles (ALPs) are of interest because of their potential to act as dark matter or to reveal information about yet undiscovered fundamental constituents of matter. Such particles can be created when photons traverse regions of magnetic fields. The conversion probability depends on both the magnetic field parameters and photon energy, leading to multiple spectral absorption features as light passes through magnetized regions.   Traditionally, astrophysical searches have focused on detecting such features in individual objects. However, the limited understanding of properties of cosmic magnetic fields have hindered the progress. Here we introduce a new approach by analyzing stacked (rather than individual) spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) positioned behind galaxy clusters â gigantic magnetic field reservoirs. Stacking efficiently averages over the uncertainties in magnetic fields, revealing a unique step-like spectral signature of photon-to-ALP conversion.   With this approach we advance into previously inaccessible regions of the ALP parameter space for nano-electronvolt masses. Adopting this method will significantly improve existing bounds across a wide range of masses by using different telescopes and increasing the size of the stacked datasets.

<p>Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the systemâs velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.</p>

<p>We investigate two classes of dark matter (DM) candidates, sub-GeV particles and primordial black holes (PBHs), that can inject low-energy electrons and positrons into the Milky Way and leave observable signatures in the X-ray sky. In the case of sub-GeV DM, annihilation or decay into $e^+e^-$ contributes to the diffuse sea of cosmic-ray (CR) leptons, which can generate bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton (IC) emission on Galactic photon fields, producing a broad spectrum from X-rays to $\gamma$-rays detectable by instruments such as eROSITA and XMM-Newton. For PBHs with masses below $\sim10^{17}$ g, Hawking evaporation similarly yields low-energy $e^\pm$, leading to comparable diffuse emission. Using the first data release from eROSITA and incorporating up-to-date CR propagation and diffusion parameters, we derive new constraints on both scenarios. For sub-GeV DM, we exclude thermally averaged annihilation cross sections in the range $\sim 10^{-27}-10^{-25} \ \mathrm{cm^3/s}$ and decay lifetimes of $\sim 10^{24}-10^{25}$ s for masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, with eROSITA outperforming previous X-ray constraints below $\sim$ 30 MeV. For asteroid-mass PBHs, we set new bounds on the DM fraction based on their Hawking-induced emission. Finally, we revisit earlier constraints from XMM-Newton, finding that they were approximately four orders of magnitude too stringent due to the use of the instrumentâs geometric solid angle rather than its exposure-weighted solid angle. Upon using the exposure-weighted solid angle, we show that the revised XMM-Newton limits are slightly weaker than those from eROSITA.</p>

<p>A class of viable $F(R)$ gravity models which can provide a unified description of inflation with the dark energy era is confronted with the latest observational data on the dark energy era. These models have the unique characteristic that the de Sitter scalaron mass in the Einstein frame counterpart theory is a monotonic function of the curvature, which renders them viable descriptions for both the inflationary and the late-time acceleration eras. We also compare these models with other well-known viable $F(R)$ gravity models and with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. As we show, the most phenomenologically successful models are those which deviate significantly from the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. Also some of the models presented, provide a statistically favorable description of the dark energy eras, compared with the exponential $F(R)$ gravity model and of course compared with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. All the models we present in this article are confronted with the observational data from the Planck collaboration, the Pantheon plus data from Type Ia supernovae, the two rounds of observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, data from baryon acoustic oscillations and the Hubble constant measurements by SH0ES group. As we show, two of the models are statistically favorable by the data.</p>

<p>First-order phase transitions (FOPT) are ubiquitous in beyond the Standard Model physics and leave distinctive echoes in the history of early universe. We consider a FOPT serving the well-motivated role of dark matter mass generation and present {\it blast-frozen dark matter} (BFDM), which transitions from radiation to non-relativistic relic in a period much shorter than the corresponding Hubble time. Its cosmological imprint are strong oscillations in the dark matter density perturbations that seed structure formation on large and small scales. For a FOPT occurring not long before the matter-radiation equality, next generation cosmological surveys bear a strong potential to discover BFDM and in turn establish the origin of dark matter mass.</p>

<p>Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of these attractor states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation is not well understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius. Subsequent accretion and relaxation around this $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ fall-off, establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile, a quasi-steady state attractor of collisionless relaxation that is not particularly sensitive to initial conditions. Given enough time though, the halo tends to Maxwellianize and develop an isothermal sphere profile. We demonstrate for the first time that the universal NFW profile emerges as an attractor solution to a self-consistent theory for collisionless relaxation.</p>

<p>2025-06-02, <strong>Evolution of Wormholes under f(R, T) Theory, the Karmarkar Condition and the Casimir Energy</strong>, Murat Metehan Turkoglu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02074v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.02074v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, both the evolution of wormholes (by examining both the energy conditions and using the TOV equations) and the effects of the Karmarkar condition on the solutions obtained under certain specific cases were examined in the light of the $f(R,T)$ gravity theory, using two $f(R,T)$ functions predicted to describe the accelerated expansion of the universe. In this context, for the first time in the literature, a generalized shape function was obtained using the Karmarkar condition. It was observed that solutions of the type $R-a_{1}^2/R+a_{2}g(T)$ satisfy the energy conditions (with the dominant energy condition being partially satisfied), whereas solutions of the type $R+a_{1}^2R^2+a_{2}g(T)$ require the presence of exotic matter. In both cases, stable, static, and traversable wormhole solutions were obtained. By applying the Karmarkar condition to the $R+a_{1}^2R^2+a_{2}g(T)$ type solutions, which violate the energy conditions, the relationship between wormhole geometry and energy conditions was investigated. The study examined whether the Karmarkar condition eliminates the need for exotic matter, and it was found that the solutions do not remove the necessity of exotic matter. Additionally, it was demonstrated that a specific value of the parameter, ${\beta}$, which determines the radial variation of the shape function, could ensure the stability of the wormhole throat with the aid of Casimir energy. In other words, it is considered possible that the geometric evolution of the wormhole throat could trigger the transition from positive energy (baryonic matter) to negative energy (dark matter, dark energy, or other exotic matter) by inducing Casimir forces.</p>

<p>Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is now well established as a key observational approach to address critical topics at the frontiers of astroparticle physics and high-energy astrophysics. Whilst the field of TeV astronomy was once dominated by arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, ground-level particle detection has now been demonstrated to be an equally viable and strongly complementary approach. Ground-level particle detection provides continuous monitoring of the overhead sky, critical for the mapping of extended structures and capturing transient phenomena. As demonstrated by HAWC and LHAASO, the technique provides the best available sensitivity above a few tens of TeV, and for the first time access to the PeV energy range. Despite the success of this approach, there is so far no major ground-level particle-based observatory with access to the Southern sky. HESS, located in Namibia, is the only major gamma-ray instrument in the Southern Hemisphere, and has shown the extraordinary richness of the inner galaxy in the TeV band, but is limited in terms of field of view and energy reach.   SWGO is an international effort to construct the first wide-field instrument in the south with deep sensitivity from 100s of GeV into the PeV domain. The project is now close to the end of its development phase and planning for construction of the array in Chile has begun. Here we describe the baseline design, expected sensitivity and resolution, and describe in detail the main scientific topics that will be addressed by this new facility and its initial phase SWGO-A. We show that SWGO will have a transformational impact on a wide range of topics from cosmic-ray acceleration and transport to the nature of dark matter. SWGO represents a key piece of infrastructure for multi-messenger astronomy in the next decade, with strong scientific synergies with the nearby CTA Observatory.</p>

<p>Dark matter consisting of a Bose-Einstein-Condensate (BEC) of ultra-light particles is predicted to have a soliton shape that shifts with the dark matter mass fraction in galaxies with a centrally localized stellar mass (such as a black hole). In the self-gravitating dark matter limit, the predicted cored soliton shape is consistent with previous numerical predictions and analytical approximations. As the dark matter mass fraction decreases, the soliton is predicted to become increasingly cusp shaped, asymptotically approaching an exponential density distribution (isomorphic with a Hydrogen 1s state), with a central slope comparable to that predicted by cold dark matter simulations. The soliton shapes are obtained by solving the associated Schr"{o}dinger-Poisson equation with the ground state wavefunction represented as a sum of Gaussians with numerically optimized amplitudes and widths. The results are used to express the soliton size, total mass and density directly in terms of the corresponding velocity dispersion, by invoking an approximation relating tracer star rotational velocity and dispersion that is validated by experimental observations. Applications of the predictions, as well as challenges associated with critically testing dark matter models, are illustrated using comparisons with dwarf spheroidal (dSph) and ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy observations. Implications include speculations regarding the possible role of dark matter evaporation in galactic evolution, as well as a light-dark-matter hypothesis that dark matter solitons may be photon condensates, if photons have a non-zero rest mass consistent with the upper bounds established by a wide range of optical and electrodynamic measurements.</p>

<p>We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars (hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectorsâ mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with $\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM), we find $H_0=72.1^{+4.0}_{-3.7}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on $H_0$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM to 4.4%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\phi}$CDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO $H_0$ inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.</p>

<p>Barrow and Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) are two recently proposed extensions of the standard HDE framework, incorporating generalized corrections to horizon entropy through the use of Barrow and Tsallis entropies. Tsallis entropy arises from non-extensive statistical phenomena which account for long-range correlations and deviations from additivity, while Barrow entropy emerges from quantum-gravitational effects on the horizon geometry, associated with fractal modifications and deformations. At the cosmological level, both scenarios lead to the same equations, nevertheless the involved parameters obey different theoretical bounds. In this work, we use observational data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), including the recently released DESI DR2 dataset, to place constraints on both scenaria. We show that both can be in agreement with observations, although they cannot alleviate the $H_0$ tension. However, applying information criteria we deduce that both of them are not favoured comparing to $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmological paradigm.</p>

<p>The latest DESI DR2 results, when combined with other independent cosmological data on the Cosmic Microwave Background and supernovas, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy.   We propose a novel cosmological scenario, which features two distinct scalar fields. One governs the magnitude of the present-day dark energy density and is related to the size of extra-dimensions. Accounting for the observed smallness of this energy density requires the scalar to reside near the boundary of field space.   The second field, responsible for the time evolution of dark energy and associated with the string coupling, must instead lie in the bulk to remain consistent with the non-observation of light string states. We show that a natural candidate for such dark energy dynamics is a quintessence modular-invariant potential, in which the second scalar field rolls down a negatively curved slope, starting from a self-dual critical point. We find that this scenario is in good agreement with the latest findings by DESI.</p>

<p>2025-06-03, <strong>Impact of convective overshooting on the single-degenerate model of Type Ia supernovae</strong>, Xinghuan Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02551v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2506.02551v1</a></p>

<p>The single-degenerate (SD) model is one of the principal models for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However, it faces some challenges, the primary being its inability to account for the observed SN Ia birth rate. Many studies have attempted to address this issue by expanding the parameter space, defined by the initial donor star mass and orbital period, that can lead to SNe Ia, as well as by improving binary population synthesis. While these efforts have led to significant progress, many uncertainties in stellar physics persist, which influences the outcomes of such studies. Convective overshooting, which can significantly affect the internal structure of a star and subsequently its evolution within a binary system, is one of the most significant sources of uncertainty in stellar physics. We investigate the effect of convective overshooting on the parameter space and birth rate of SNe Ia within the SD model. We employed the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, a new version of the SD model, as our progenitor model. Using MESA, we obtained the parameter space that leads to SNe Ia for three different convective overshooting parameters and calculated the corresponding SN Ia birth rate. Convective overshooting expands the upper boundaries (corresponding to a larger initial donor mass) and right boundaries (corresponding to a longer initial orbital period) of the parameter space for systems with massive white dwarfs (WDs; &gt;= 0.75Msun). However, the minimum WD mass and the parameter space for low-mass WDs - and, consequently, the calculated SN Ia birth rate - vary non-monotonically with convective overshooting parameters. The CEW model may explain the SNe Ia that interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., SNe Ia-CSM. We find that the parameter space for SNe Ia-CSM increases with convective overshooting parameters, as does their birth rate.</p>

<p>We present the chemical composition of a sample of 37 red giant branch (RGB) stars belonging to the main body of the remnant of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. All stars were observed with the FLAMES-UVES high-resolution spectrograph. Twenty-three new targets are selected along the blue side of the RGB of Sgr, but outside the galaxy stellar nucleus, in order to avoid contamination by the stars of the metal-poor globular cluster M54. Additionally, we re-analyzed archival spectra of fourteen targets located on the red RGB. For this sample, we derive the abundances of 21 chemical species (from Oxygen to Europium) representing different nucleosynthetic sites. The sample covers a large range of metallicity, from [Fe/H]~-2 to ~ -0.4 dex and we can identify the transition between the enrichment phases dominated by core-collapse (CC-SNe) and Type Ia (SNe-Ia) supernovae. The observed [{\alpha}/Fe] trend suggests a knee occurring at [Fe/H]~-1.5/-1.3 dex, compatible with the rather low star formation efficiency of Sgr. At lower [Fe/H], Sgr stars exhibit a chemical composition compatible with Milky Way stars of similar [Fe/H]. The only relevant exceptions are [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Eu/Fe]. At [Fe/H] higher than ~ -1.5/-1.3 dex, instead, the chemical pattern of Sgr significantly deviates from that of the Milky Way for almost all the elements analyzed in this study. Some of the abundance patterns reveal a lower contribution by very massive stars exploding as hypernovae (e.g. [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe]), a higher contribution by sub-Chandrasekhar progenitors of SNe Ia (e.g. [Ni/Fe]) and a high production efficiency of rapid neutron-capture elements ([Eu/Fe]).</p>

<p>A class of viable $F(R)$ gravity models which can provide a unified description of inflation with the dark energy era is confronted with the latest observational data on the dark energy era. These models have the unique characteristic that the de Sitter scalaron mass in the Einstein frame counterpart theory is a monotonic function of the curvature, which renders them viable descriptions for both the inflationary and the late-time acceleration eras. We also compare these models with other well-known viable $F(R)$ gravity models and with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. As we show, the most phenomenologically successful models are those which deviate significantly from the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. Also some of the models presented, provide a statistically favorable description of the dark energy eras, compared with the exponential $F(R)$ gravity model and of course compared with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. All the models we present in this article are confronted with the observational data from the Planck collaboration, the Pantheon plus data from Type Ia supernovae, the two rounds of observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, data from baryon acoustic oscillations and the Hubble constant measurements by SH0ES group.

<p>Current data in the form of baryon acoustic oscillation, supernova, and cosmic microwave background distances prefer a cosmology that accelerates more strongly than $\Lambda$CDM at $z\approx0.5-1.5$, and more weakly at $z\lesssim0.5$. We examine dark energy physics that can accommodate this, showing that interactions (decays, coupling to matter, nonminimal coupling to gravity) fairly generically tend not to give a satisfactory solution (in terms of fitting both distances and growth) even if they enable the effective dark energy equation of state to cross $w=-1$. To fit the cosmological data it appears the dark energy by itself must cross $w=-1$, a highly unusual physical behavior.</p>

<p>Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are perhaps the most numerous class of peculiar thermonuclear supernova and yet their sample size, particularly those observed shortly after explosion, remains relatively small. In this paper we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two SNe Iax discovered shortly after explosion, SN 2024bfu and SN 2025qe. Both SNe were observed by multiple all-sky surveys, enabling tight constraints on the moment of first light and the shape of the early light curve. Our observations of SN 2025qe begin &lt;2 d after the estimated time of first light and represent some of the earliest observations of any SN Iax. We identify features consistent with carbon absorption throughout the spectroscopic evolution of SN 2025qe, potentially indicating the presence of unburned material throughout the ejecta. Inspired by our early light curve coverage, we gather a sample of SNe Iax observed by ATLAS, GOTO, and ZTF, and measure their rise times and early light curve power-law rise indices. We compare our findings to a sample of normal SNe Ia and find indications that SNe Iax show systematically shorter rise times, but the small sample size and relatively large uncertainties prevent us from identifying statistically significant differences in most bands. We find some indication that SNe Iax show systematically lower rise indices than normal SNe Ia in all bands. The low rise indices observed among SNe Iax is qualitatively consistent with extended $^{56}$Ni distributions and more thoroughly-mixed ejecta compared to normal SNe Ia, similar to predictions from pure deflagration explosions.</p>

<p>The impending discovery and monitoring of hundreds of new gravitationally lensed quasars and supernovae from upcoming ground and space based large area surveys such as LSST, \textit{Euclid}, and \textit{Roman} necessitates the development of improved numerical methods for studying gravitational microlensing. We present in this work the fastest microlensing map generation code currently publicly available. We utilize graphics processing units to take advantage of the inherent parallelizable nature of creating magnification maps, in addition to using 1) the fast multipole method to reduce the runtime dependence on the number of microlenses and 2) inverse polygon mapping to reduce the number of rays required.

<p>Inferences on the properties Type II supernovae (SNe) can provide significant insights into the lives and deaths of the astrophysical population of massive stars and potentially provide measurements of luminosity distance, independent of the distance ladder. Here, we introduce surrogate models for the photospheric properties and lightcurves of Type II SNe trained on a large grid of simulations from the radiation hydrodynamics code, {\sc stella}. The trained model can accurately and efficiently ($\sim 30$ms) predict the lightcurves and properties of Type II SNe within a large parameter space of progenitor ($10-18 M_{\odot}$ at ZAMS) and nickel masses ($0.001-0.3M_{\odot}$), progenitor mass-loss rate ($10^{-5}-10^{-1}~M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), CSM radius ($1-10\times10^{14}$cm), and SN explosion energies ($0.5-5 \times 10^{51}$erg). We validate this model through inference on lightcurves and photosphere properties drawn directly from the original {\sc stella} simulations not included in training. In particular, for a synthetic Type II SNe observed within the 10-year LSST survey, we find we can measure the progenitor and nickel masses with $\approx 9\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ precision, respectively, when fitting the photometric data while accounting for the uncertainty in the surrogate model itself. Meanwhile, from real observations of SN~2004et, SN~2012aw, and SN~2017gmr we infer a progenitor ZAMS mass of $12.15_{-1.06}^{+1.03} M_{\odot}$, $10.61_{-0.32}^{+0.37} M_{\odot}$, $10.4 \pm 0.3 M_{\odot}$, respectively. We discuss systematic uncertainties from our surrogate modelling approach and likelihood approaches to account for these uncertainties. We further discuss future extensions to the model to enable stronger constraints on properties of Type II SNe and their progenitors, for cosmological applications, and applications of our surrogate modelling approach to other transients.</p>

<p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most energetic and enigmatic transients in the radio sky, with mounting evidence suggesting newborn, highly magnetized neutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) as their sources. A definitive spatial association between an FRB and a historic CCSN would confirm this link and tightly constrain young neutron star source models. Here we report on the first systematic cross-matching of 886 spectroscopically classified CCSNe in the local Universe (z $\leq$ 0.043) against 241 CHIME/FRB Catalog 1 events, applying rigorous spatial, dispersion measure (DM), and scattering time (${\tau}$) criteria. We identify four positional overlaps, all consistent with chance alignment; however, one pair, FRB 20190412B-SN 2009gi, also satisfies independent host-DM and ${\tau}$ constraints, making it a promising candidate for targeted follow-up. Next, we search for compact (persistent or transient) radio emission at all matched supernova sites using multi-epoch VLASS data and detect none. Treating every CCSN sight line as a non-detection, we derive Poisson upper limits on the FRB burst rate at these locations, which lie well below the rates observed for the most active repeaters unless their activity is heavily suppressed by beaming, intermittency, or residual free-free absorption. We then develop a galaxy-integrated FRB-rate model that incorporates an intrinsic spectral index, secular magnetar-activity decay, and frequency-dependent free-free opacity. Applying this formalism to existing FRB data shows that reproducing the observed CHIME/CRAFT all-sky rate ratio requires a steep decline in magnetar burst rates with age. Finally, our work underscores the necessity of sub-arcsecond localizations and multiwavelength follow-up to definitively test the young neutron star source hypothesis.</p>
