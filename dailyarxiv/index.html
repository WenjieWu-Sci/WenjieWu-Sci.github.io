<p>2024-08-19, <strong>Sensitivity of WIMP bounds on the velocity distribution in the limit of a massless mediator</strong>, Koun Choi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09658v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.09658v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the sensitivity of the bounds on the spin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron interaction couplings $\alpha_{SI, SD}^{p,n}$ on the WIMP velocity distribution for a massless mediator in the propagator by combining direct detection and the neutrino signal from WIMP annihilation in the Sun (fixing the annihilation channel to $b\bar{b}$). We update the bounds in the Standard Halo Model (SHM) and using the halo-independent single-stream method. In the case of a massless mediator the SHM capture rate in the Sun diverges and is regularized by removing the contribution of WIMPs locked into orbits that extend beyond the Sun-Jupiter distance. We discuss the dependence of the SHM bounds on the Jupiter cut showing that it can be sizeable for $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ and a WIMP mass $m_\chi$ exceeding 1 TeV. Our updated SHM bounds show an improvement between about two and three orders of magnitude compared to the previous ones in the literature. Our halo-independent analysis shows that, with the exception of $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ at large $m_\chi$, the relaxation of the bounds compared to the SHM is of the same order of that for contact interactions, i.e. relatively moderate in the low and high WIMP mass regimes and as large as a few $\times\sim 10^2$ for $m_\chi\simeq$ 30 GeV. On the other hand, the exact determination of the relaxation of the bound becomes not reliable for $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ and $m_\chi\gtrsim$ 1 TeV due to the sensitivity of the SHM capture rate in the Sun to the details of the Maxwellian velocity distribution at low incoming WIMP speeds. The halo-independent bounds do not depend on the Jupiter cut needed to regularize the calculation of the capture rate.</p>

<p>2024-08-19, <strong>From Low- to High-Frequency QPOs around the Non-Rotating Hairy Horndeski Black Hole: Microquasar GRS 1915+105</strong>, Orhan Donmez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10102v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.10102v1</a></p>

<p>Research on the Horndeski black hole, associated with the scalar hairy parameter, offers insights into enigmatic cosmic phenomena such as dark matter. Additionally, the numerical study of the GRS 1915+105 source, which exhibits continuous variability in X-ray observations, along with its physical properties and mechanisms behind Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) frequencies, can contribute to observational studies. Motivated by this, we examine the variations in physical mechanisms around the non-rotating Horndeski black hole with Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion related to the scalar hair parameter and the resulting QPO frequencies. With a decrease in the scalar hair parameter, the shock cone opening angle narrows due to the influence of the scalar field potential, and the stagnation point within the cone moves closer to the black hole horizon. With the changing scalar hair parameter, the simultaneous formation of the shock cone and bow shock is observed. Due to the intense increase in scalar potential, both the shock cone and bow shock disappeared, and a cavity surrounding the black hole forms in the area where the shock cone was. Additionally, QPO oscillations induced by the physical mechanisms observed in relation to the hair parameter are revealed through numerical simulations. A broad range of QPO frequencies is observed, from low to high frequencies, with resonance states like 3:2 occurring. Lastly, we define the potential range of the spin parameter for the GRS 1915+105 source based on the agreement between observational and numerical results. It has also been found that for most of the QPOs obtained from numerical calculations to be consistent with observations, h/M should be greater than -0.5.</p>

<p>2024-08-19, <strong>Newtonian Gravity and Galaxy Rotation Curves: An Axisymmetric Greenâs Function Perspective</strong>, Jan Govaerts et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09977v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.09977v1</a></p>

<p>The standard proposal within the context of General relativity and its weak field Newtonian limit for the nature of dark matter is that it consists of dark matter particles of unknown type. In the present work and specifically for spiral galaxy rotation curves, an alternative possibility is explored, in the form of an axially symmetric vortex mass distribution of finite extent threading the centre of the galaxy and perpendicular to its disk. Some general considerations are developed and characteristic properties are identified, pointing to the potential interest of such an alternative to be studied in earnest.</p>

<p>2024-08-19, <strong>Improved background modeling for dark matter search with COSINE-100</strong>, G. H. Yu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09806v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.09806v1</a></p>

<p>COSINE-100 aims to conclusively test the claimed dark matter annual modulation signal detected by DAMA/LIBRA collaboration. DAMA/LIBRA has released updated analysis results by lowering the energy threshold to 0.75 keV through various upgrades. They have consistently claimed to have observed the annual modulation. In COSINE-100, it is crucial to lower the energy threshold for a direct comparison with DAMA/LIBRA, which also enhances the sensitivity of the search for low-mass dark matter, enabling COSINE-100 to explore this area. Therefore, it is essential to have a precise and quantitative understanding of the background spectrum across all energy ranges. This study expands the background modeling from 0.7 to 4000 keV using 2.82 years of COSINE-100 data. The modeling has been improved to describe the background spectrum across all energy ranges accurately. Assessments of the background spectrum are presented, considering the nonproportionality of NaI(Tl) crystals at both low and high energies and the characteristic X-rays produced by the interaction of external backgrounds with materials such as copper. Additionally, constraints on the fit parameters obtained from the alpha spectrum modeling fit are integrated into this model. These improvements are detailed in the paper.</p>

<p>2024-08-19, <strong>ApostleâAuriga: Effects of stellar feedback subgrid models on the evolution of angular momentum in disc galaxies</strong>, Hang Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09784v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.09784v1</a></p>

<p>Utilizing the ApostleâAuriga simulations, which start from the same zoom-in initial conditions of Local Group-like systems but run with different galaxy formation subgrid models and hydrodynamic solvers, we study the impact of stellar feedback models on the evolution of angular momentum in disc galaxies. At $z = 0$, Auriga disc galaxies tend to exhibit higher specific angular momenta compared to their cross-matched Apostle counterparts. By tracing the evolution history of the Lagrangian mass tracers of the in-situ star particles in the $z = 0$ galaxies, we find that the specific angular momentum distributions of the gas tracers from the two simulations at the halo accretion time are relatively similar. The present-day angular momentum difference is mainly driven by the physical processes occurring inside dark matter haloes, especially galactic fountains. Due to the different subgrid implementations of stellar feedback processes, Auriga galaxies contain a high fraction of recycled gas tracers (${\sim} 65$ per cent) which could acquire angular momentum through mixing with the high angular momentum circumgalactic medium (CGM). In Apostle, however, the fraction of recycled gas tracers is significantly lower (down to ${\sim} 20$ per cent for Milky Way-sized galaxies) and the angular momentum acquisition from the CGM is marginal. As a result, the present-day Auriga galaxies overall have higher specific angular momenta.</p>

<p>2024-08-18, <strong>The Search for the Cosmological Axion â A New Refined Narrow Mass Window and Detection Scheme</strong>, Masroor H. S. Bukhari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09553v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.09553v1</a></p>

<p>Based upon a previous axion mass proposal and detection scheme, as well as considering the axion mass ranges suggested by cogent simulations in recent years, we present a revised axion/ALP Search strategy and our calculations, concentrating on a narrow axion Compton frequency window in this report. The window comprises the spectral region of 18.99 to 19.01GHz (that falls within the Ku microwave band), with a center frequency of 19.00GHz (+0.1GHz), with equivalence to a corresponding axion mass range of 78.6 to 79.6 micro-eV, with the center mass at the value of 78.582 (+5.0) micro-eV, our suggested most likely value for an axionic/ALP field mass, if these fields exist in nature. Our search strategy, as summarized herewith, is based upon the assumption that the dark matter that exists in the current epoch of our physical universe is dominated by axions and thus the local observable axion density is the density of the invisible light cold dark matter, permeating our local neighborhood (mainly in the Milky Way galactic halo). Some ideas and the design of an experiment, built around a Josephson Parametric Amplifier and Resonant Tunneling Diode in a resonant RF cavity, are also introduced in this report.</p>

<p>2024-08-19, <strong>[O II] as an Effective Indicator of the Dependence Between the Standardised Luminosities of Type Ia Supernovae and the Properties of their Host Galaxies</strong>, B. Martin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09645v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.09645v1</a></p>

<p>We have obtained IFU spectra of 75 SN Ia host galaxies from the Foundation Supernova survey to search for correlations between the properties of individual galaxies and SN Hubble residuals. After standard corrections for light-curve width and SN colour have been applied, we find correlations between Hubble residuals and the equivalent width of the [O II] $\lambda\lambda$ 3727, 3729 doublet (2.3$\sigma$), an indicator of the specific star formation rate (sSFR). When splitting our sample by SN colour, we find no colour dependence impacting the correlation between EW[O II] and Hubble residual. However, when splitting by colour, we reveal a correlation between the Hubble residuals of blue SNe Ia and the Balmer decrement (2.2$\sigma$), an indicator of dust attenuation. These correlations remain after applying a mass-step correction, suggesting that the mass-step correction does not fully account for the limitations of the colour correction used to standardise SNe Ia. Rather than a mass correction, we apply a correction to SNe from star forming galaxies based on their measurable EW[O II]. We find that this correction also removes the host galaxy mass step, while also greatly reducing the significance of the correlation with the Balmer decrement for blue SNe Ia. We find that correcting for EW[O II], in addition to or in place of the mass-step, may further reduce the scatter in the Hubble diagram.</p>
