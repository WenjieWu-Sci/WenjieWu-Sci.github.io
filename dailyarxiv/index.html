<p>2025-02-10, <strong>Neutrino Interaction Vertex Reconstruction in DUNE with Pandora Deep Learning</strong>, DUNE Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06637v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.06637v1</a></p>

<p>The Pandora Software Development Kit and algorithm libraries perform reconstruction of neutrino interactions in liquid argon time projection chamber detectors. Pandora is the primary event reconstruction software used at the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, which will operate four large-scale liquid argon time projection chambers at the far detector site in South Dakota, producing high-resolution images of charged particles emerging from neutrino interactions. While these high-resolution images provide excellent opportunities for physics, the complex topologies require sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities to interpret signals from the detectors as physically meaningful objects that form the inputs to physics analyses. A critical component is the identification of the neutrino interaction vertex. Subsequent reconstruction algorithms use this location to identify the individual primary particles and ensure they each result in a separate reconstructed particle. A new vertex-finding procedure described in this article integrates a U-ResNet neural network performing hit-level classification into the multi-algorithm approach used by Pandora to identify the neutrino interaction vertex. The machine learning solution is seamlessly integrated into a chain of pattern-recognition algorithms. The technique substantially outperforms the previous BDT-based solution, with a more than 20\% increase in the efficiency of sub-1\,cm vertex reconstruction across all neutrino flavours.</p>

<p>Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for double and single beta decays are crucial for studying neutrino properties beyond and within the standard model. The NMEs consist mainly of the spin isospin components. The delta isobar resonance, which is strongly excited by the qualk spin isospin excitation, is shown to quench the spin isospin NMEs by a coefficient around 0.7. Impact of the delta resonance on neutrino studies in nuclei is discused.</p>

<p>2025-02-10, <strong>First Search for Neutral Current Coherent Single-Photon Production in MicroBooNE</strong>, MicroBooNE Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06091v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.06091v2</a></p>

<p>This article presents the first search for neutrino-induced neutral current coherent single-photon production (NC coherent 1$\gamma$). The search makes use of data from the MicroBooNE 85-tonne active volume liquid argon time projection chamber detector, situated in the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB), with an average neutrino energy of $\langle E_{\nu}\rangle \sim 0.8$ GeV. A targeted selection of candidate neutrino interactions with a single photon-like electromagnetic shower in the final state and no visible vertex activity was developed to search for the NC coherent 1$\gamma$ process, along with two auxiliary selections used to constrain the dominant background from NC$\pi^0$ production. With an integrated exposure of $6.87 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target delivered by the BNB, we set the world’s first limit for this rare process, corresponding to an upper limit on the flux-averaged cross section of $\sigma&lt;1.49 \times 10^{-41}\text{cm}^2$ at 90\% C.L.</p>

<p>2025-02-10, <strong>Reconstructing the shape of the non-linear matter power spectrum using CMB lensing and cosmic shear</strong>, Karen Perez Sarmiento et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06687v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.06687v1</a></p>

<p>We reconstruct the non-linear matter power spectrum $P(k)$ using a joint analysis of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and lensing of galaxies. This reconstruction is motivated by the $S_8$ tension between early-universe CMB predictions and late-time observables. We use CMB lensing data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 and cosmic shear data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 release to perform a gravity-only (i.e. no baryonic feedback) fit to $P(k)$ in bins of wave-number, within $\rm{\Lambda CDM}$. We find that with DES cosmic shear data alone, $P(k)$ departs from the early-universe CMB prediction on all scales. The joint fit with CMB lensing is consistent on large scales $k&lt;0.2 \;{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ but shows a $\sim 2 \sigma$ deviation from scale-independence when extending to $k = 10 \;h/\mathrm{Mpc}$. We compare our agnostic $P(k)$ reconstruction to baryonic feedback models and non-standard dark matter models: reasonable variations of both scenarios can recover the shape and amplitude of the suppression. We discuss the advances needed to disentangle these physical effects with a full mapping of $P(k,z)$.</p>

<p>2025-02-10, <strong>Mapping luminous and dark matter in the Universe</strong>, Nora Elisa Chisari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06644v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.06644v1</a></p>

<p>Our standard model of the Universe predicts the distribution of dark matter to $1\%$ at the scales needed for upcoming experiments, yet our predictions for how the luminous matter -which has interactions besides gravity- is distributed remain highly uncertain. Understanding how much gas and stars there are in the Universe and where they preferentially live is challenging, and the uncertainty affects how well we can understand the cosmological model itself. For example, it compromises our ability to tell apart different models for dark energy, the mysterious force driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this Essay, I will touch upon many recent developments that suggest we will be able to overcome this limitation before data from new experiments become available. More excitingly, I will describe how our efforts to model luminous and dark matter jointly will create new possibilities for constraining the physics of supermassive black holes, galaxies, and gas over time.</p>

<p>2025-02-10, <strong>Euclid: A complete Einstein ring in NGC 6505</strong>, C. M. O’Riordan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06505v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.06505v1</a></p>

<p>We report the discovery of a complete Einstein ring around the elliptical galaxy NGC 6505, at $z=0.042$. This is the first strong gravitational lens discovered in Euclid and the first in an NGC object from any survey. The combination of the low redshift of the lens galaxy, the brightness of the source galaxy ($I_\mathrm{E}=18.1$ lensed, $I_\mathrm{E}=21.3$ unlensed), and the completeness of the ring make this an exceptionally rare strong lens, unidentified until its observation by Euclid. We present deep imaging data of the lens from the Euclid Visible Camera (VIS) and Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instruments, as well as resolved spectroscopy from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). The Euclid imaging in particular presents one of the highest signal-to-noise ratio optical/near-infrared observations of a strong gravitational lens to date. From the KCWI data we measure a source redshift of $z=0.406$. Using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) we measure a velocity dispersion for the lens galaxy of $\sigma_\star=303\pm15\,\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$. We model the lens galaxy light in detail, revealing angular structure that varies inside the Einstein ring. After subtracting this light model from the VIS observation, we model the strongly lensed images, finding an Einstein radius of 2.5 arcsec, corresponding to $2.1\,\mathrm{kpc}$ at the redshift of the lens. This is small compared to the effective radius of the galaxy, $R_\mathrm{eff}\sim 12.3\,\mathrm{arcsec}$. Combining the strong lensing measurements with analysis of the spectroscopic data we estimate a dark matter fraction inside the Einstein radius of $f_\mathrm{DM} = (11.1_{-3.5}^{+5.4})\%$ and a stellar initial mass-function (IMF) mismatch parameter of $\alpha_\mathrm{IMF} = 1.26_{-0.08}^{+0.05}$, indicating a heavier-than-Chabrier IMF in the centre of the galaxy.</p>

<p>2025-02-10, <strong>Galaxies in the simulated cosmic web: I. Filament identification and their properties</strong>, Yannick M. Bahe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06484v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.06484v1</a></p>

<p>As the environment harbouring the majority of galaxies, filaments are thought to play a key role in the co-evolution of galaxies and the cosmic web. In this first part of a series to understand the link between galaxies and filaments through cosmological simulations, we address two major current obstacles on this path: the difficulty of meaningful filament identification, and their poorly constrained properties and internal structure. We use the public EAGLE and TNG100 simulations to build physically motivated filament catalogues with the DisPerSE algorithm, based on the dark matter (DM) field at redshift z = 0 and z = 2, explicitly accounting for the multi-scale nature of filaments and with careful validation of results. Filament widths, lengths, and densities vary by factors ~5-100 in both simulations, highlighting the heterogeneous nature of filaments as a cosmic environment. All filaments are relatively thin, with overdensity profiles of galaxies, DM, and gas dropping to the cosmic mean within &lt;3 Mpc from their spines. Contrary to groups and clusters, filament cores are highly substructure dominated, by as much as ~80 per cent. Filament gas maps reveal rich temperature and density structures that limit the applicability of simple cylindrically symmetric models. EAGLE and TNG100 agree that z = 2 filament spines are traced by overdense cool gas in pressure equilibrium with a &gt;10x hotter envelope. However, significant differences in detail between their predicted gas property maps imply that individual simulations cannot yet describe the baryon structure of filaments with certainty. Finally, we compare our fiducial filament network to one constructed from galaxies. The two differ in many aspects, but the distance of a galaxy to its nearest galaxy-based filament still serves as a statistical proxy for its true environment.</p>

<p>2025-02-10, <strong>Exploring the link between galaxy assembly and dark matter halo assembly in IllustrisTNG: Insights from the Mutual Information</strong>, Y. D. Camargo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06077v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.06077v1</a></p>

<p>We employed Mutual Information (MI) analysis to investigate the relationship between galaxy properties and the assembly history of their host dark matter (DM) haloes from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Focusing on central and satellite galaxies with stellar masses between $10^{9} \, - \, 10^{11.5}\, h^{-1} M_\odot$, we examined the correlation between halo assembly time and galaxy assembly time, specific star formation rate (sSFR), color $(g-i)$, and galaxy formation efficiency $F_\star$. Our results indicate a strong correlation between $F_\star$ and the halo assembly time for low-mass central galaxies, suggesting a co-evolutionary relationship. In contrast, sSFR and color $(g-i)$ exhibit weaker correlations with halo assembly time, indicating that additional factors should influence these galaxy properties. Satellite galaxies show negligible correlation between their properties and halo assembly time, highlighting the impact of environmental processes on their evolution. We further extended our analysis to cluster observables, including the magnitude gap, the satellite richness, and the distances to the satellites. Although these cluster properties display weak overall correlations with halo assembly time, the richness consistently increases with stellar mass. This trend suggests that richness is more closely linked to formation history in more massive haloes, where satellite accretion dominates the growth of their host DM haloes. These findings establish $F_\star$ as a more sensitive indicator of halo assembly history than colour $(g-i)$, sSFR, or cluster observables, offering new insights into the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and the hierarchical growth of their host dark matter haloes.</p>

<p>2025-02-10, <strong>Evolution and final fates of massive stars</strong>, Sylvia Ekström et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06614v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.06614v1</a></p>

<p>Massive stars are able to pursue their evolution through the whole sequence of burning phases. They are born hot and luminous, and live a short life before exploding as a supernova or collapsing directly into a black hole. They have a strong impact on their surrounding, injecting mechanical energy, ionising radiation, and nucleosynthetic products in the interstellar medium. They are the driver of galaxy evolution and trigger star formation. Their high luminosity makes them visible in distant galaxies, and some of them are standard candles we use to root the distance ladder of the Universe. This chapter describes the status of our knowledge about massive stars and the nucleosynthetic path they go through the different phases of their evolution.</p>
