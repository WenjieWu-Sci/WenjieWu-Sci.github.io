<p>2025-10-22, <strong>Coupling of neutrino beam-driven MHD waves and resonant instabilities in rotating magnetoplasmas with neutrino two-flavor oscillations</strong>, Jyoti Turi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19729v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.19729v1</a></p>

<p>We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions. We show, for the first time, that neutrino-driven shear Alfv{'e}n and oblique magnetosonic waves can be coupled by the Coriolis force, forming new wave modes affected by this force, as well as neutrino beam and two neutrino flavor oscillations. Our work extends previous theories by demonstrating that shear Alfv{'e}n waves are influenced by neutrino effects and by identifying instabilities resulting from resonant interactions with both a streaming neutrino beam and flavor oscillations. We find that the Coriolis force, as well as plasma density and magnetic field strength, have a significant impact on the profiles of the instability growth rates. Our findings may shed new light on the physical mechanisms underlying core-collapse supernovae.</p>

<p>2025-10-22, <strong>On the origin of ~ 100 TeV neutrinos from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469</strong>, Qi-Rui Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19662v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.19662v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of TeV-PeV neutrinos detected by IceCube remains largely unknown. The most significant individual neutrino source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 at 4.2$\sigma$ level with a soft spectral index. Another notable candidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a potential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this source returned a very hard spectral index of ~ 1.9 and the excess is dominated by two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and IC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV, implying a maximum proton energy &gt; 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC 1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino spectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT observations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade flux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV flux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the neutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons are accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the corona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and X-rays from the corona through the $p\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with energy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required maximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to unity ($\sigma\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization parameter with $\sigma\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated composition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino spectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different magnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN.</p>

<p>2025-10-22, <strong>The Impact of Population III.1 Flash Reionization for CMB Polarization and Thomson Scattering Optical Depth</strong>, Jonathan C. Tan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19647v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.19647v1</a></p>

<p>The Population III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts a very early ($z\sim20-25$), transient phase, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The Flash'', of cosmic reionization powered by supermassive stars that are SMBH progenitors. The universe then quickly recombined to become mostly neutral, with this state persisting until galaxies begin to reionize intergalactic gas again at $z\sim 10$. The overall Thomson scattering optical depth, $\tau$, from The Flash has been shown to be $\tau\_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.03$, leading to a total $\tau\sim0.08-0.09$. Such a value, while significantly larger than that previously inferred from {\it Planck} observations of the low-$l$ $EE$ polarization power spectrum of the CMB, can help relieve several</code>tensions’’ faced by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, especially the preference for negative neutrino masses and dynamic dark energy. Here we compute $EE$ power spectra of example models of The Flash. We find that, because of its very high redshift, the contribution to $l\lesssim8$ modes is dramatically reduced compared to usual low-$z$ reionization models for the same value of $\tau$, while the power at $l\gtrsim8$ is boosted. Thus the Pop III.1 reionization scenario provides a natural way to increase $\tau$, while remaining closer to the latest CMB low-$l$ polarization observations.</p>

<p>2025-10-22, <strong>Coherent and incoherent antineutrino scattering on stable even-even isotopes of molybdenum detectors</strong>, T. S. Kosmas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19513v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.19513v1</a></p>

<p>The recent observations of the coherent neutrino- and antineutrino-nucleus scattering have opened up a plethora of opportunities to probe physics within standard and non-standard theories of the electroweak interactions. In the present article, our goal is to explore the possibility of using the molybdenum material as detection medium for coherent and incoherent antineutrino- and neutrino- Mo scattering in the ongoing and future coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE{\nu}NS) exper- iments by using relevant (anti-)neutrino beams as e.g. stopped pion-decay neutrino beams, reactor antineutrino beams, astrophysical (solar or supernova) (anti)neutrino beams, etc. Our present co- herent and incoherent scattering cross sections of Mo isotopes with neutrinos and antineutrinos are based on the deformed shell model (DSM) that has been previously employed for studying similar processes. On the other hand, in the past, CE{\nu}NS events obtained with this model provided us with better fits to COHERENT experimental data compared to phenomenological form factors.</p>

<p>2025-10-22, <strong>Can we ignore the time dependence in matter neutrino resonance?</strong>, Owais Ullah Faiz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19485v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.19485v1</a></p>

<p>In the vicinity of neutron star mergers (NSMs), it is possible for the neutrino self-interaction potential to cancel with the matter potential leading to matter neutrino resonance (MNR). MNR is one of the most interesting mechanisms by which neutrino flavor evolution can occur in dense astrophysical environments. Previous studies have typically assumed that the neutrino flavor field evolves to a steady state – a simplification also used in other self-interaction models such as the neutrino-bulb model. Here, we perform reproducible calculations of MNR using both time-independent and time-dependent formalisms and show that they yield qualitatively different flavor survival probabilities. The time-independent approach produces unstable steady-state solutions that differ fundamentally from the dynamical behavior captured in time-dependent simulations. These results demonstrate that the steady-state assumption is generally invalid, and physical interpretations based on time-independent calculations of dense neutrino systems require re-evaluation.</p>

<p>2025-10-22, <strong>Transfer Learning Beyond the Standard Model</strong>, Veena Krishnaraj et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19168v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.19168v1</a></p>

<p>Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models. Transfer learning offers a way to reduce the simulation cost by reusing knowledge across models. We show that pre-training on the standard model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, and fine-tuning on various beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios – including massive neutrinos, modified gravity, and primordial non-Gaussianities – can enable inference with significantly fewer beyond-$\Lambda$CDM simulations. However, we also show that negative transfer can occur when strong physical degeneracies exist between $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We consider various transfer architectures, finding that including bottleneck structures provides the best performance. Our findings illustrate the opportunities and pitfalls of foundation-model approaches in physics: pre-training can accelerate inference, but may also hinder learning new physics.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Theory overview on neutrino studies and outlook</strong>, Toni Mäkelä et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19015v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.19015v1</a></p>

<p>The forward neutrino program at the Large Hadron Collider has entered the era of providing the first measurements and observations. As it has notable connections to astrophysics and will complement the results and projections of key measurements at the LHC and other measurements, it is becoming increasingly important for collider physicists to recognize and utilize the unique potential of this novel research direction. The present work reviews a selection of questions related to the nature, masses and interactions of neutrinos, and highlights some of the recent projections for the LHC Run 3 as well as the high-luminosity run.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Freeze-in and Freeze-out in Right-Handed Neutrino Extended MSSM with Seesaw</strong>, Tushar Gupta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18969v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18969v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the possibility of saturating the relic density bound with light higgsinos. When the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model is extended with right-handed neutrino superfields and the seesaw scale is very low, right-handed sneutrinos can be produced via the freeze-in mechanism. In such a case we can have essentially two independent sources for dark matter, the traditional freeze-out of higgsinos and the freeze-in of right-handed sneutrinos. The heavier of these two will decay to the lighter species with a delay. We rule out such a scenario for all seesaw models as the lifetime of sterile neutrinos, produced over-abundantly via Dodelson-Widrow mechanism, exceeds the age of the universe and will contribute to the relic density.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>The Generalised Casas-Ibarra Parametrisation for Majorana Neutrino Masses</strong>, Juan Herrero García et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18962v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18962v1</a></p>

<p>We present a simple and broadly applicable extension of the Casas-Ibarra parametrisation that captures the structure of all Majorana neutrino mass models. Building directly on the original formulation, our approach naturally accommodates additional degrees of freedom and provides a unified, minimal framework for parametrising the Yukawa sector. It significantly simplifies both analytical treatments and numerical scans, and can be universally applied to any Majorana neutrino mass model, regardless of the underlying dynamics. The approach also offers a unified framework for classifying neutrino mass models according to the structure of the neutrino mass matrix, which naturally motivates the proposal of an extended version of the Scotogenic Model. This classification scheme yields tree-level (loop-level) representative models: the seesaw (Scotogenic Model), the linear seesaw (the Generalised Scotogenic Model), and the linear plus inverse seesaw (the Extended Scotogenic Model). We provide ready-to-use explicit expressions for several well-known scenarios, including the Zee model where one of the Yukawa matrices is antisymmetric.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>The $B^+ \to K^+ ν\bar ν$ decay as a search for the QCD axion</strong>, Merna Abumusabh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18953v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18953v1</a></p>

<p>We reinterpret the $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ measurement as a probe of the decay $B^+ \to K^+ a$, where $a$ denotes an axion or axion-like particle. This is possible in the kinematic regions where the di-neutrino invariant mass squared, $q^2$, can be identified with the assumed $m_a^2$. While $q^2$ is reconstructed only in the Hadronic Tag Analysis (HTA), it is not directly accessible in the Inclusive Tag Analysis (ITA), which provides much larger statistics and hence higher sensitivity. In ITA, $q^2$ is proxied by a reconstructed variable, $q^2_{\text{rec}}$, usually modeled through Belle II simulations. We show that the mapping between $q^2$ and $q^2_{\text{rec}}$ can be accurately derived from kinematic arguments alone – without relying on internal experimental inputs. Using this relation and publicly available efficiencies, we obtain the strongest existing bounds on the coupling-rescaled Peccei-Quinn scale, $|(F_V)_{sb}| \ge 0.9 \times 10^9$ GeV, improving the latest bound in the literature by an order of magnitude. We further show that the bound depends only marginally on the assumed value of the di-neutrino signal strength $\mu_{\nu{\bar\nu}}$, whether fixed or floated. This establishes $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ as a double probe – of new short-distance physics in the $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar\nu$ amplitude, and of new light, elusive particles produced via $B^+ \to K^+ a$ – the two probes working independently to an excellent approximation.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>N-body Simulations of cosmologies with Light Massive Relics</strong>, Vikhyat Sharma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18797v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18797v1</a></p>

<p>The presence of additional relativistic particles at the time of recombination can be inferred through their contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. If these species have a finite but low mass (Light Massive Relics - LiMRs), they act as a hot subcomponent of dark matter and impact late-time structure formation. Understanding these effects will be crucial to pin down the underlying particle physics properties of any future $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ detection. While their impact has been well-studied on linear scales, this work develops the framework for and presents results from the first set of cosmological N-body simulations that can track the effects of LiMRs, as a function of their mass and temperature, down to fully nonlinear scales. Importantly, our simulations model the impact of both the massive Standard Model neutrinos and LiMRs, which will be crucial in disentangling possible degeneracies. We systematically explore the effects of LiMR properties such as mass, temperature, and initial distribution, on various cosmological observables, including the total matter power spectrum, Halo Mass Functions (HMF), Mass-Concentration relation, radial halo profiles, and weak lensing signals around massive clusters. The framework and simulations developed here will enable detailed follow-up of the rich phenomenology of LiMR cosmologies.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Integrated Luminosity with 100 ppm Precision, Methods for $\sqrt{s}$ Precision of 1 ppm, and Beyond Standard Model Sensitivity using Photonic Events, at $\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}$ Higgs Factories</strong>, Brendon Madison et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18666v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18666v1</a></p>

<p>Future electron-positron ($\ee$) colliders, operating as Higgs factories or Z factories, promise unprecedented precision electroweak measurements that are vital to testing the Standard Model (SM) and exploring physics beyond it. Here we present work on the precision of integrated luminosity ($\mathcal{L}$) and center-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s}$), measurements that are needed to make future precision measurements possible. We also conduct these studies for the International Linear Collider (ILC) from the Z pole ($m_{Z}$) to 1~TeV to provide a comprehensive study of these issues for future $\ee$ colliders. Paths to 100 parts-per-million (ppm) precision on $\mathcal{L}$ are presented, with focus on small-angle Bhabha scattering (SABS) and two-photon production (diphotons, $\gamma\gamma$). Previous studies found that beam deflection of SABS events introduce biases on $\mathcal{L}$ of $10^{-2}$. To address this, we present a novel method that uses M\o{}ller scattering with SABS to measure beam deflection and minimize its effect on $\mathcal{L}$. We present a proposal for a Highly Granular Luminosity Calorimeter, the GLIP LumiCal, and its design considerations. We demonstrate that the GLIP LumiCal can achieve $\approx35$ ppm precision on $\mathcal{L}$ precision with diphotons for all values of $\sqrt{s}$ and that the current LumiCal design is insufficient for reaching 1000 ppm. Multiple methods for precision $\sqrt{s}$ estimation are presented. We introduce the use of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to ensure that $\sqrt{s}$ is measured accurately and precisely The utility of photon measurements is extended to photon with invisible ($X^0\gamma$) events where we demonstrate methods to measure left-handed and right-handed neutrino couplings and put constraints on Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Comprehensive analysis of dissipative effects in the induced gravitational waves</strong>, Yan-Heng Yu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18663v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18663v1</a></p>

<p>Dissipation is an intrinsic property of the cosmic fluid, leading to the damping of curvature perturbations at small scales. In this paper, we comprehensively study dissipative effects in gravitational waves induced by curvature perturbations, known as induced gravitational waves (IGWs). We find dissipative effects become especially significant at wavenumber $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$, where $k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ corresponds to the horizon scale at the decoupling of weakly-interacting particles. They can leave characteristic features on the IGW spectrum, including a notable suppression with a ``double-valley’’ structure at $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ and a modified infrared behavior without logarithmic running at $k \lesssim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, dissipative effects caused by neutrinos at the nanohertz frequencies can be important in the analysis of pulsar timing array data. Furthermore, dissipation-induced features associated with possible new weakly-interacting particles can be detectable by a wide range of gravitational-wave experiments, serving as a promising probe of new physics at extremely high energy scales. As an extension, we also discuss dissipative effects in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity and their impacts on the anisotropies of IGWs and the poltergeist mechanism. These dissipative effects not only provide a more realistic description of IGWs but also exhibit rich phenomenology and profound physical implications, opening a new window into understanding the early Universe and fundamental physics.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Heavy Neutral Lepton at Same-Sign Muon Collider</strong>, Ryuichiro Kitano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18390v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18390v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the discovery potential of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), motivated by models addressing the origin of neutrino masses, at the proposed high-energy same-sign muon collider known as $\mu$TRISTAN. The study focuses on two complementary HNL-mediated signatures: (i) the lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) channel $\mu^+\mu^+ \to W^+\tau^+\bar\nu_\mu$ and (ii) the lepton-number-violating (LNV) channel $\mu^{+}\mu^{+} \to W^{+}W^{+}$. The LNV process is the muon analogue of inverse neutrinoless double beta decay and, if observed, would provide strong evidence for Majorana neutrinos, while the LFV process offers a novel probe of flavor-changing neutral currents in the lepton sector. At the $\mu$TRISTAN collider with $\sqrt{s} \sim \mathcal{O}(10)~\text{TeV}$, the resulting sensitivity to the HNL mixing with muon and tau neutrinos, as a function of mass, can surpass current bounds from the measurements of electroweak precision observables over a broad mass range. In particular, for the mixing with muon neutrinos, the collider bound can improve by an order of magnitude for $5$-$10$ TeV HNLs.</p>

<p>The neutrino dipole portal (NDP) is a minimal and predictive extension of the Standard Model, in which a transition magnetic moment operator couples an active neutrino to a heavy neutral lepton via the electromagnetic field. This higher-dimensional interaction gives rise to distinctive processes such as neutrino up-scattering, radiative decays, meson transitions, and modifications of recoil spectra, offering multiple avenues for discovery. In this review, we discuss the theoretical foundations of the NDP, its ultraviolet completions, and the associated production and decay mechanisms across laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological settings. Current constraints arise from accelerator searches, recoil-based detectors, collider studies, and high energy neutrino observatories, complemented by robust bounds from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave Background, and supernova cooling. Future experimental and observational efforts, including next-generation neutrino experiments, multi-ton dark matter detectors, and improved cosmological and astrophysical probes, are anticipated to test the remaining allowed regions. The NDP thus provides a simple, well-motivated, and broadly testable framework at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.</p>

<p>Binary neutron star mergers provide a laboratory for probing fundamental physics through their gravitational- wave emission and electromagnetic counterparts. In particular, they may allow us to explore signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model in strong-gravity regimes, such as those of dark matter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of light dark matter, modeled as a minimally coupled scalar field, surrounding a binary neutron star system. Our primary focus is to assess whether the scalar field remains bound to the binary over the late inspiral-merger timescales and to determine its potential impact on observable signatures. We find that, in a range of scenarios, the scalar field forms a common cloud around the binary that does not disperse. At sufficiently high densities, this leads to measurable effects, including a dephasing of the binary inspiral, a less compact post-merger remnant, and suppression of the dynamical ejecta. For densities motivated by astrophysical considerations, however, these effects remain small and are unlikely to be detectable with current or next-generation gravitational-wave observatories.</p>

<p>Numerous astronomical and cosmological observations point to the existence of dark matter, which constitutes about 27% of the Universe. Despite extensive efforts, only the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, using NaI(Tl) detectors at Gran Sasso National Laboratory, has reported a positive dark matter signal. To independently verify this result, using the same NaI target is essential. This is the goal of ANAIS-112, operating with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators since 2017 at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). This thesis presents work within ANAIS-112, focusing on data analysis and the development of Geant4-based simulations to reduce systematics and increase sensitivity. Efforts have focused on understanding the ANAIS-112 crystals’ response to nuclear recoils. Systematic uncertainties related to the scintillation quenching factors (QFs) of sodium and iodine recoiling in NaI(Tl) must be addressed to ensure reliable comparisons with DAMA/LIBRA and other experiments. For that purpose, onsite neutron calibrations in ANAIS-112 have been performed since 2021 at LSC using 252Cf sources. This work has compared calibration data with Geant4-based neutron simulations, which has revealed Geant4 deficiencies in certain decay processes and cross sections in some versions. The simulations have proven highly sensitive to the QF used, favouring models in which the QF increases with energy and disfavouring DAMA values. In parallel, this thesis has contributed to improving the ANAIS-112 background model through a multiparametric fit of its background components. New physics searches have been conducted using ANAIS-112 data, including a reanalysis of the annual modulation signal and a search for solar axions using six years of exposure. Finally, this thesis also includes work within the COSINUS experiment, focused on background modelling and the impact of internal backgrounds on the experiment’s sensitivity.</p>

<p>We numerically study the formation of the gauge-mediation type Q balls in the logarithmic square potential on three-dimensional lattices. We obtain the broad charge distribution of the Q ball of this type for the first time. The charge of the Q ball at the peak of the distribution is smaller than what we estimated as the average of the largest tens of the Q balls in the logarithmic potential for the same initial amplitude of the field at the onset of its oscillation. We also discuss some impacts of the broad distribution on cosmology and astrophysics. In the B ball (Q being the baryon number) case, the broad distribution would lead to the coexistence of both stable and unstable B balls. We find that stable B balls can account for the dark matter of the universe without affecting successful big bang nucleosynthesis by the decay of the unstable B balls, but the baryon number of the universe cannot be explained by them. On the other hand, the large L balls (Q being the lepton number) would be the dark matter as well while avoiding the constraints on the X and/or gamma rays from the decay of the smaller L balls.</p>

<p>The growing number of binary black hole mergers detected through gravitational waves offers unprecedented insight into their underlying population, yet their astrophysical formation channels remain unresolved. We present a new method to distinguish binary black hole formation channels using their spatial clustering at cosmological scales. Employing the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation Illustris, we trace the distribution of mergers across cosmic time and compare them with the underlying matter distribution associated with three candidate origins: isolated binary stellar evolution, binaries embedded in AGN disks, and primordial black holes within dark matter halos. For mergers at redshift $z \lesssim 0.5$, these channels show distinct clustering signatures that could be accessible with proposed upgrades to current ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. Using mock catalogs for next- generation facilities such as Cosmic Explorer, we find that their sensitivities would enable differentiation of these formation pathways out to redshift $z \sim 5$ within the first decade of observations. This approach provides a new framework to link gravitational-wave populations with the large-scale structure of the Universe. By treating black hole mergers as cosmological tracers, our results demonstrate how cross- correlations between gravitational-wave catalogs and the cosmic matter field can constrain the relative contribution of stellar, AGN, and primordial channels, offering a complementary probe to population- inference studies. These findings underscore the emerging potential of gravitational-wave cosmology to reveal where and how black holes form and merge across cosmic history.</p>

<p>We propose a two-field model where the inflaton $\chi$ is non-minimally coupled to the instanton $\phi$. By choosing an appropriate coupling function, we realize the scenario where the difference of the values of potential between false vacuum (FV) and true vacuum (TV) is maximized during inflation. Most of the bubbles are created at this time. After inflation ends, the potential value of FV drops below that of TV so that these bubbles collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.</p>

<p>Constructing a general-purpose framework for mapping between dark matter simulations and observable hydrodynamical simulation outputs is a long-standing problem in modern astrophysics. In this work, we present a new approach utilizing stochastic interpolants to map between cheap fast particle mesh simulations and baryonic quantities in three dimensions, requiring a total of 7 GPU minutes per 256^3 grid size simulation. Using the CAMELS multifield dataset, we are able to condition our mapping on both cosmological and astrophysical properties. We focus this work on hydrodynamical quantities suitable for Lya observables finding excellent agreement up to small spatial scales, k ~ 10.0 (h^(-1) Mpc) at z=2.0, for Lya flux statistics. Our approach is fully convolutional, allowing training on comparatively small volumes and application to larger volumes, which was tested on TNG50.</p>

<p>Surrounding Sgr A<em>, a cluster of young and massive stars coexist with a population of dust-enshrouded objects, whose astrometric data can be used to scrutinize the nature of Sgr A</em>. An alternative to the black hole (BH) scenario has been recently proposed in terms of a supermassive compact object composed of self-gravitating fermionic dark matter (DM). Such horizon-less configurations can reproduce the relativistic effects measured for S2 orbit, while being part of a single continuous configuration whose extended halo reproduces the latest GAIA-DR3 rotation curve. In this work, we statistically compare different fermionic DM configurations aimed to fit the astrometric data of S2, and five G-sources, and compare with the BH potential when appropriate. We sample the parameter spaces via Markov Chain Monte Carlo statistics and perform a quantitative comparison estimating Bayes factors for models that share the same likelihood function. We extend previous results of the S2 and G2 orbital fits for 56 keV fermions (low core-compactness) and show the results for 300 keV fermions (high core-compactness). For the selected S2 dataset, the former model is slightly favoured over the latter. However, more precise S2 datasets, as obtained by the GRAVITY instrument, remain to be analysed in light of the fermionic models. For the G-objects, no conclusive preference emerges between models. For all stellar objects tested, the BH and fermionic models predict orbital parameters that differ by less than 1%. More accurate data, particularly from stars closer to Sgr A*, is necessary to statistically distinguish between the models considered.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>The Lensing Counter Narrative: An Effective Description of Small-Scale Clustering in Weak Lensing Power Spectra</strong>, Joseph DeRose et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18981v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18981v1</a></p>

<p>We present a new formalism to separate large- and small-scale contributions to cosmic shear through $\textit{lensing counterterms}$ (LCT) inspired by effective field theory (EFT). Marginalizing over these LCTs isolates the large-scale cosmological signal in weak lensing power spectra while simultaneously constraining the impact of baryonic feedback or new physics (e.g. axion dark matter) at small scales. Our formalism removes the need for hard scale cuts in standard analyses, even when theoretical predictions are limited to below a physical cutoff $\Lambda$, resulting in significant improvements in constraining power – up to $5\times$ smaller in the case of a LSST-Y10-like analysis without marginalizing over baryons when the analysis cutoff is set to $\Lambda = 1.0h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conduct a proof-of-principle analysis on the publicly available DES Y3 data, finding $S_8= 0.761\pm 0.045$ and $S_8 = 0.794\pm 0.040$ for analyses with cutoffs of $\Lambda = 0.5h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $1.0 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, respectively, with no detection of modifications to small-scale clustering at $k &gt; \Lambda$ beyond the predictions of collisionless dark matter in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. We make our $\texttt{JAX}$-based pipeline, $\texttt{gholax}$, integrated with intrinsic alignment predictions from the EFT of large-scale structure at 1-loop, publicly available.</p>

<p>Machine learning has the potential to improve the reconstruction of the dark matter profile of galaxies with respect to traditional methods, like rotation curves. We demonstrate on the simulation suite Illustris-TNG that a steerable equivariant convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to infer the dark matter profiles within and around individual galaxies from photometric and interferometric data, improving on a standard CNN. Within the in silico environment of the simulations, our architecture is able to capture the dark matter distribution within galaxies without a parametrization of the profile. We perform an interpretability analysis to understand the internal mechanisms of the trained model and the most important data features used to estimate the dark matter profiles. The equivariant CNN recovers the dark matter profile of galaxies within the stellar mass range $[10^{10} - 10^{12} ]$ $M_{\odot}$ with excellent precision and accuracy: the mean squared error is reduced by a factor of ~ 3 from its value under the training distribution, demonstrating that the network has learnt from the data features. While this holds within the controlled ‘in silico’ environment of the simulation, we argue that few additional steps are needed before this method can be reliably applied to galaxies in the real field observations.</p>

<p>Dark matter may not be perfectly stable, and its decay could generate distinctive gravitational-wave signatures.

<p>Galactic warps are common in disk galaxies. While often attributed to galaxy–galaxy tides, a non-spherical dark matter (DM) halo has also been proposed as a driver of disk warping. We investigate links among warp morphology, satellite distribution, and large-scale structure using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog of warped disks compiled by Zee et al.\ (2022). Warps are classified into 244 S and 127 U types, hosting 1,373 and 740 satellites, respectively, and are compared to an unwarped control matched in stellar mass, redshift, and local density. As an indirect, population-level proxy for the host halo’s shape and orientation, we analyze the stacked spatial distribution of satellites. Warped hosts show a significant anisotropy: an excess at $45^{\circ}&lt;\phi&lt;90^{\circ}$ (measured from the host major axis), peaking at $P(\phi)\simeq 0.003$, versus nearly isotropic controls. Satellites of S-type warps preferentially align with the nearest cosmic filament, whereas those of U-type warps are more often perpendicular. The incidence of warps increases toward filaments ($r_{\rm fil}&lt;4,{\rm Mpc},h^{-1}$), while the number of satellites around warped hosts remains approximately constant with filament distance, indicating a direct influence of the large-scale environment. We discuss possible links between galactic warps and the cosmic web, including anisotropic tidal fields and differences in evolutionary stage.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Very High Precision Astrometry for Exoplanets and Dark Matter with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</strong>, Fabien Malbet et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18920v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18920v1</a></p>

<p>Astrometry, one of the oldest branches of astronomy, has been revolutionized by missions like Hipparcos and especially Gaia, which mapped billions of stars with extraordinary precision. However, challenges such as detecting Earth-like exoplanets in nearby habitable zones and probing the influence of dark matter in galactic environments require sub-microarcsecond accuracy. With a 6–8 meter large-aperture telescope operating across at visible wavelengths, the Habitable Worlds Observatory by NASA can combine astrometry and direct imaging to detect rocky exoplanets within 10 parsecs and study their atmospheres. We consider here the scientific requirements and present a concept for a dedicated astrometric instrument on HWO. It is capable to produce diffraction-limited images of large fields, achieving a point-spread function (PSF) precision of 20 milliarcseconds. Equipped with a detector calibration system, HWO can perform high precision astrometry, and, detect and measure the orbit of Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of Nearby Solar-type stars. HWO can dramatically improve current constraints on the self- interaction cross-section of heavy dark matter particles (WIMPs) and on the masses of ultra-high dark matter particles, through the study of stellar motions in galactic environments. The visible channel of the instrument features a large CMOS-based focal plane with stitched pixel arrays, enabling a large field of view. The ``Detector Calibration Unit’’ system uses interferometric laser fringes to calibrate pixel positions. Using differential astrometry and pointed observations with a stable telescope design enables extended integration times, enhancing sensitivity to sub-microarcsecond precision for detecting exoplanets and studying dark matter through stellar motion.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Beware of the running $n_s$ when producing heavy primordial black holes</strong>, Sasha Allegrini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18791v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18791v1</a></p>

<p>We examine single-field inflationary models for the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)~\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that the observed preference for positive running ($\alpha_s$) of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space of ultra slow roll scenarios (USR). This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter (DM). To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of polynomial models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to efficiently scan over the space of viable models. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>The Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter:connecting precision muon physics, cosmology, and colliders</strong>, Alexander Belyaev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18564v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18564v1</a></p>

<p>We present a comprehensive study of the Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter (MPVDM), a minimal yet phenomenologically rich extension of the Standard Model featuring a new SU(2)_D gauge symmetry and vector-like muons. In this framework the dark sector interacts with the Standard Model only through these heavy leptons, linking dark matter and the muon sector. The MPVDM can simultaneously explain the observed relic abundance and the muon anomalous magnetic moment a_mu under both the “tension” and “compatibility” scenarios motivated by recent (g-2)_mu results. A key finding is a generic off-resonance velocity suppression mechanism that allows light (&lt;1 GeV) vector dark matter to evade CMB limits near 2*m_DM ~ m_H_D. Unlike scenarios based on ultra narrow Breit-Wigner resonances and early kinetic decoupling, the suppression follows from the temperature evolution of the annihilation cross section in a moderately detuned near resonant regime, where being 10-20 percent below resonance gives the required CMB era suppression without fine tuning. A five dimensional parameter scan shows that the tension scenario requires sub GeV dark matter with g_D ~ 1e-3 and TeV scale vector like muons, while the compatibility scenario admits a broad mass range up to multi TeV. Recasting ATLAS and CMS searches for mu+ mu- + E_T^miss sets a lower bound of about 850 GeV on vector like muons. The MPVDM thus offers a unified, predictive, and experimentally accessible framework linking dark matter and muon physics across cosmological and collider frontiers.</p>

<p>We present a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant simple model of galaxy dynamics obtained by applying the Dressing Field Method (DFM) to a general-relativistic system comprising the metric and four scalar fields, phenomenologically representing the four-velocity of a cosmological fluid or dust field. The DFM, a systematic tool for extracting the gauge-invariant content in general-relativistic theories, provides a physical coordinatization that yields corrective terms to the rotational velocity profile. These corrections produce galaxy rotation curves that combine a Keplerian and a constant velocity terms, effectively emulating a Dark Matter contribution. We compare DFM-derived rotation curves to observed data for spiral galaxies, from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database, showing that the DFM allows to fit them well.</p>

<p>Composite axions offer a scenario where the axion emerges as a pion-like state, avoiding fine-tuning of elementary scalars and ameliorating the axion quality problem. Despite these advantages, their post-inflationary cosmology remains largely unexplored, with challenges including the domain wall problem and the presence of exotic relics. We propose two composite axion models with an effective domain wall number $N_\text{DW} = 1$ and study the dilution of relics via a short period of inflation. One model is based on an $SU(5)$ chiral gauge theory, while the other employs a ``gauged’’ $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry in vector-like $SU(N)$ gauge theories. We identify the viable parameter space in which axion strings re-enter the horizon before or even after the QCD transition and axion dark matter is dominantly produced from the decay of the string-wall network.</p>

<p>Some new-generation dark matter detection experiments are primarily designed to search for the dark matter-electron interactions, but they can also be utilized to probe models in which dark matter couples exclusively to nucleon via the quantum effects. The hadronic loop-induced interactions can directly excite plasmons in semiconductors, thereby providing an additional channel for detecting the leptophobic dark matter. In this work, we investigate plasmon excitations in silicon detectors induced by boosted dark matter and cosmic-ray up-scattering dark matter via the hadronic loop process. By analyzing the available experimental data, we derive new exclusion limits on the leptophobic dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section.</p>

<p>We present the $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ line-intensity mock maps and forecast the capabilities of upcoming wide-field submillimeter-wave surveys of cosmological $\mathrm{[CII]}$ emission from the epoch of reionization (EoR). Using the $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ algorithm to generate light-cone dark matter (DM) halo catalogues and the $\mathtt{WebSky}$ framework to forward-model the cosmological $\mathrm{[CII]}$ signal, we construct tomographic mock surveys matched to the CCAT Observatory. We investigate both astrophysical models of $\mathrm{[CII]}$ emission from interstellar gas and the potential for the study of primordial intermittent non-Gaussianity (PING) as a science case for Stage 2 line intensity mapping (LIM) surveys. The $\mathrm{[CII]}$ voxel intensity distribution (VID) is used as a summary statistic in forecasts. Additional constraints on PING are derived from a relative entropy study of $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ halo mass functions. We show that upcoming LIM surveys will provide insights into the way we model cosmological line emission, and next-generation surveys can place competitive bounds on novel inflationary scenarios such as PING. The $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ mocks and corresponding $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ halo catalogues are publicly available at https://uoft.me/webskycii .</p>

<p>This work presents and investigates novel traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of Asymptotically Safe Gravity (ASG), sourced by a dark matter halo modeled by the Dekel–Zhao density profile. The scale-dependent gravitational coupling $G(k)$, derived from the ASG renormalization group flow in the infrared regime, is incorporated directly into the field equations, providing a consistent description of quantum gravitational corrections even at astrophysical scales. The combined effects of the running coupling (parameterized by $\xi$) and the dark matter characteristics determine the geometric structure and physical viability of the wormhole. The solutions satisfy the flare-out and asymptotic flatness conditions within restricted parameter domains, exhibiting enhanced curvature near the throat due to ASG corrections. Null Energy Conditions are necessarily violated at the throat, and stability analysis based on the adiabatic sound speed as well as the modified Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation reveal that quantum effects from ASG counteract the destabilizing influence of dark matter. Phenomenologically, the wormhole shadow radius increases nearly linearly with $\xi$, lying within the Event Horizon Telescope bounds for Sgr~A$^*$ when $\xi/M \simeq 0.8–0.9$, thus suggesting that ASG-corrected wormholes may represent observable signatures of quantum gravity in the strong-field regime.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Milky Way Mass Through Escape Velocity Curve from LAMOST K Giants</strong>, Yin Wu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18227v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18227v1</a></p>

<p>Escape velocity has long been used to constrain the mass of the Dark Matter (DM) halo in the Milky Way (MW). Here we present a study of the escape velocity curve using a sample of high-velocity K giants with full 6D phase-space information and relatively good quality, selected from LAMOST DR8 and cross-matched with Gaia DR3. To expand the high-velocity stars to larger distances, we used radius-dependent criteria of total velocity, that is, $v_{\rm GC}&gt;300\;\rm{km s^{-1}}$ for the solar neighborhood; $v_{\rm GC}&gt;v_{\rm min}\sim0.6\times v_{\rm esc}(r_{\rm GC})$ for outer region. We also selected halo stars based on $v_{\phi}-{\rm [Fe/H]}$ information to ensure that the sample is isotropic. We modeled the velocity distribution with traditional power-law models to determine the escape velocity in each radial bin. For the first time, we have directly measured a relatively continuous escape velocity curve that can extend to Galactocentric radii of $\sim 50$ kpc, finding a decline in agreement with previous studies. The escape velocity at the solar position yielded by our measurements is $523.74^{+12.83}_{-13.47}\;\rm{km s^{-1}}$. Combined with the local circular velocity, we estimated the mass of the MW assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White DM profile, which resulted in a total mass of $M_{200,\;\rm{total}}=0.90_{-0.07}^{+0.06}\times 10^{12}\;M_{\odot}$, with a concentration of $c_{200}=13.47_{-1.70}^{+1.85}$. The small uncertainty implies that including the escape velocities beyond the solar neighborhood can result in a more precise mass estimate. Our derived MW mass is consistent with some recent studies using the escape velocity as well as other tracers, which may support a lower mass of the DM halo than in the past.</p>

<p>Early interaction of supernova blast waves with CSM has the potential to accelerate particles to PeV energies, although this has not yet been detected. Current models for this interaction assume the shock expands into a smooth stellar wind, although observations of many SNe do not support this assumption.   We extend previous work by considering shocks expanding into complex density profiles consisting of smooth winds with dense CSM shells at various distances from the progenitor star. We aim to predict the gamma-ray and multiwavelength signatures of CSM interaction.   We used the PION code to model the CSM around LBV including a brief episode of enhanced mass-loss and to simulate the formation of photoionization-confined shells around RSGs. Consequently, we used the time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic rays in SNe expanding into these media and to evaluate the emitted radiation across the whole electromagnetic spectrum.   We find that the interaction with the CSM shells can significantly boost the gamma-ray emission, with the emission peaking weeks to years after the explosion. The peak luminosity for Type-IIP and Type-IIn remnants can exceed the luminosity expected for smooth winds by orders of magnitude. For Type-IIP explosions, the light-curve peak is only reached years after the explosion. We evaluate the multiwavelength signatures expected from the interaction of the blast wave with a dense CSM shell from radio, over optical, to thermal X-rays.   We identify high-cadence optical surveys and continuous monitoring of nearby SN in radio and mm wavelengths as the best-suited strategies for identifying targets that should be followed-up by gamma-ray observatories. We predict that gamma-rays from interaction with dense CSM shells may be detectable out to a few Mpc for late interaction, and tens of Mpc for early interaction.</p>

<p>2025-10-22, <strong>Anomalous scattering of pulsars towards the Gum Nebula</strong>, M. A. Krishnakumar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19388v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.19388v1</a></p>

<p>We report wideband scatter-broadening estimates of 14 pulsars towards the Gum nebula region using the Band-3 of the upgraded GMRT. This work increases the measurements of frequency scaling index of scatter-broadening ($\alpha$) across the nebula by more than 3 times. A strong correlation between the distance and the scattering strength is observed for pulsars behind the nebula. It is also observed that for distant pulsars ($&gt; 2 kpc$), the effect of the Gum nebula in DM and scattering strength is not substantial. We also report a much flatter $\alpha$ for the Vela pulsar and argue that its scattering is not caused by the Gum nebula, but the Vela supernova remnant.</p>

<p>2025-10-22, <strong>$H_0$ Without the Sound Horizon (or Supernovae): A 2% Measurement in DESI DR1</strong>, E. A. Zaborowski et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19149v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.19149v1</a></p>

<p>The sound horizon scale $r_s$ is a key source of information for early-time $H_0$ measurements, and is therefore a common target of new physics proposed to solve the Hubble tension. We present a sub-2% measurement of the Hubble constant that is independent of this scale, using data from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR1). Building on previous work, we remove dependency on the sound horizon size using a heuristic rescaling procedure at the power spectrum level. A key innovation is the inclusion of \emph{uncalibrated} (agnostic to $r_s$) post-reconstruction BAO measurements from DESI DR1, as well as using the CMB acoustic scale $\theta_*$ as a high-redshift anchor. Uncalibrated type-Ia supernovae are often included as an independent source of $\Omega_m$ information; here we demonstrate the robustness of our results by additionally considering two supernova-independent alternative datasets. We find somewhat higher values of $H_0$ relative to our previous work: $69.2^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$, $70.3^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$, and $69.6^{+1.3}_{-1.8}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ respectively when including measurements from i) Planck/ACT CMB lensing $\times$ unWISE galaxies, ii) the DES Year 3 6$\times$2pt analysis, and iii) Planck/ACT CMB lensing + the DES Year 5 supernova analysis. These remarkably consistent constraints achieve better than 2% precision; they are among the most stringent sound horizon-independent measurements from LSS to date, and provide a powerful avenue for probing the origin of the Hubble tension.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Stellar cooling limits on KK gravitons and dark dimensions</strong>, Edward Hardy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18975v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18975v1</a></p>

<p>We revisit cooling bounds on light Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, as arise in the dark dimension scenario, considering red giants, neutron stars, and supernovae. In addition to bremsstrahlung, we account for two novel production channels: resonant mixing with the in-medium photon and a pion-induced process in supernovae. The strongest limits arise from SN 1987A, with the emissivity from the pion process exceeding that from bremsstrahlung by a factor of a few. Given present uncertainties, we obtain a bound on the KK mass scale of $m_{\rm KK}\gtrsim 0.6\,{\rm eV}$ $(\gtrsim 500\,{\rm eV})$ for 2 (3) extra dimensions. Improved understanding of the properties of pions in supernovae could strengthen these limits to roughly ${\rm eV}$ $({\rm keV})$. For 1 extra dimension, the bounds are weaker than those from laboratory searches. We also show that constraints from KK graviton decays to Standard Model particles are less stringent than the cooling bounds if there is KK number violation at the level typically assumed in the dark dimension scenario, although these bounds could be strengthened by future observations.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>AT2025ulz and S250818k: zooming in with the Hubble Space Telescope</strong>, Yu-Han Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18854v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18854v1</a></p>

<p>AT2025ulz is an optical/near-infrared transient discovered during follow-up of the candidate gravitational wave (GW) event S250818k. Its young age ($\lesssim$1 d), rapid decline and strong color evolution over the first 48 hr classify it as a potential kilonova candidate. In this work, we present the results of our observing campaign, carried out with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Although the early time evolution of AT2025ulz resembles some aspects of a kilonova, its rapid onset ($\sim$3 hr after the GW trigger) and luminosity (a factor of $\sim5$ brighter than AT2017gfo in $g$-band) are difficult to reproduce. Only a small subset of our kilonova models matches its multi-color light curve, and the inferred ejecta mass is uncomfortably large given the low chirp mass ($\lesssim!0.87!$ M$_{\odot}$) of the GW candidate. HST observations place the transient within a nearby ($z=0.08489$) spiral galaxy with on-going star-formation and measure a color ($F336W-F160W!\approx!1.4$ mag) that is too blue to match with a kilonova. Our data support the classification of AT2025ulz as a supernova, initially undergoing a shock-cooling phase and later entering its photospheric phase, and spectroscopically identified via its broad absorption features.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>The role of the secondary white dwarf in a double-degenerate double-detonation explosion, in the supernova remnant phase</strong>, Gilles Ferrand et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18800v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18800v1</a></p>

<p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are believed to be thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf (WD) stars, but their progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms are still unclear. Here we focus on double degenerate systems, where two WDs are interacting, and on the double detonation mechanism, where a detonation of a helium shell triggers a detonation of the carbon-oxygen core of the primary WD. We take the results from three-dimensional SN simulations of Pakmor et al 2022 (arXiv:2203.14990) and carry them into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, until 1500 yr after the explosion. We reveal signatures of the SN imprinted in the SNR morphology. We confirm the impact of a companion on the SNR: its presence induces a conical shadow in the ejecta, that is long lived. Its intersection with the shocked shell is visible in projection as a ring, an ellipse, or a bar, depending on the orientation. New, we test the case of a nested explosion model, in which the explosion of the primary induces the secondary to also explode. As the explosion of the secondary WD is weaker only the primary outer ejecta interact with the ambient medium and form the main SNR shell. The secondary inner ejecta collide with the reverse shock, which enhances the density and thus the X-ray emissivity. The composition at the points of impact is peculiar, since what is revealed are the outer layers from the inner ejecta. This effect can be probed with spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of young SNRs.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Multiple shells in supernova 2023ixf support the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM)</strong>, Noam Soker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18782v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18782v1</a></p>

<p>Examining the photospheric time evolution of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 2023ixf from the literature, we identify three evolutionary time periods with constant expansion velocities, which we attribute to three ejecta shells. We find that several CCSN remnants have morphologies with two or more complete or partial shells, compatible with the presence of two or three photospheric shells during the photospheric phase of the explosion. Studies have attributed these CCSN remnants to the jittering-jet explosion mechanism (JJEM), which involves two or three energetic pairs of jets participating in the explosion. We, therefore, conclude that the structure of the photospheric shells of SN 2023ixf supports its explosion by the JJEM. This study adds to the accumulating evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNE.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Particle acceleration at radiative supernova remnant shocks</strong>, Pierre Cristofari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18763v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18763v1</a></p>

<p>Numerous astrophysical shock waves evolve in an environment where the radiative cooling behind the shock affects the hydrodynamical structure downstream, thereby influencing the potential for particle acceleration via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA).   We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool and from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of supernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle acceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the total proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our results indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during the first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated multi-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be detectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is found to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the test-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a growing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and the effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles are confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron spectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR shock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA can take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total electron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from thermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young radiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for which the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-1} - 1$ M$_{\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Probing cosmology with bright sirens from the CosmoDC2_BCO LSST synthetic catalog</strong>, Ranier Menote et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18752v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18752v1</a></p>

<p>Bright sirens, i.e. gravitational-wave detections of compact binary mergers with electromagnetic counterparts, provide a self-calibrated distance-redshift relation and are therefore powerful probes of cosmic expansion. Using the CosmoDC2_BCO catalog, we forecast cosmological constraints from current (LVK) and next-generation (ET, CE) detector networks, in combination with a Roman-like Type Ia supernova sample. We find that third-generation networks reach sub-percent precision on the Hubble constant within a few years, achieving 0.2% after a decade with CE+ET+LVK, while LVK remains limited to the 6% level. The LVK fifth observing run may shed light on the H_0 tension only if the inferred value falls outside the range spanned by the Planck and SH0ES determinations, which currently achieve far higher precisions. Supernovae do not directly tighten H_0 but stabilize its inference through parameter correlations and enable an absolute calibration of the supernova magnitude M_B. In dynamical dark-energy models, the joint analysis of Roman supernovae and bright sirens yields a Figure of Merit of 25 for ET+LVK and 76 for CE+ET+LVK, to be compared with the state-of-the-art DESI DR2 BAO plus DESY5 supernovae value of 56. Sky-localization thresholds of DeltaOmega &lt; 50 deg^2, or even DeltaOmega &lt; 10 deg^2, entail only mild penalties, suggesting efficient follow-up strategies. These results establish third-generation GW+EM observations, especially when combined with Roman supernovae, as a cornerstone for precision cosmology in the next decade.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Binding energy of compact stars and their non-radial oscillations</strong>, P. Laskos-Patkos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18706v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18706v1</a></p>

<p>In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Unveiling the nature of HE 0107-5240</strong>, E. Caffau et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18498v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18498v1</a></p>

<p>The vast majority of the most iron-poor stars in the Galaxy exhibit a strong carbon enhancement, with C/H ratios only about two orders of magnitude below solar. This unusual chemical composition likely reflects the properties of the gas cloud from which these stars formed, having been enriched by one, or at most a few, supernovae. A remarkable member of this stellar class, HE 0107-5240 with [Fe/H]=-5.56, has been identified as part of a binary system. To constrain its orbital parameters, radial velocity monitoring has been carried out using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Radial velocities were derived using cross-correlation with a template, taking advantage of the strong G-band feature. Combining all observations yielded a high signal-to-noise spectrum, which has been used to refine our understanding of the stellar chemical composition. Additionally, a co-added UVES spectrum in the blue was used to complement the wavelength coverage of ESPRESSO. Observations of HE 0107-5240 over a span of more than four years have yielded a revised orbital period of about 29 years. Updated elemental abundances have been determined for Sc, Cr, Co, and, tentatively, Al, along with a new upper limit for Be. The iron abundance has been derived from ionised Fe lines. Significant upper limits have been established for Li, Si, and Sr. The star is confirmed to be a long-period binary. Iron abundances derived from neutral and ionised lines are consistent with local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) assumption, casting doubt on published deviation from LTE corrections for Fe for this star. The heavy elements Sr and Ba remain undetected, confirming the classification of HE 0107-5240 as a carbon enhanced metal-poor and non enhanced in heavy elements (CEMP-no) star and supporting the absence of an n-capture element plateau at the lowest metallicities.</p>
