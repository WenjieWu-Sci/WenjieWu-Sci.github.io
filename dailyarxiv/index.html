<p>2023-08-22, <strong>A Measurement of Gravitational Lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background Using SPT-3G 2018 Data</strong>, Z. Pan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11608v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.11608v1</a></p>

<p>We present a measurement of gravitational lensing over 1500 deg$^2$ of the Southern sky using SPT-3G temperature data at 95 and 150 GHz taken in 2018. The lensing amplitude relative to a fiducial Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is found to be $1.020\pm0.060$, excluding instrumental and astrophysical systematic uncertainties. We conduct extensive systematic and null tests to check the robustness of the lensing measurements, and report a minimum-variance combined lensing power spectrum over angular multipoles of $50&lt;L&lt;2000$, which we use to constrain cosmological models. When analyzed alone and jointly with primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectra within the $\Lambda$CDM model, our lensing amplitude measurements are consistent with measurements from SPT-SZ, SPTpol, ACT, and Planck. Incorporating loose priors on the baryon density and other parameters including uncertainties on a foreground bias template, we obtain a $1\sigma$ constraint on $\sigma_8 \Omega_{\rm m}^{0.25}=0.595 \pm 0.026$ using the SPT-3G 2018 lensing data alone, where $\sigma_8$ is a common measure of the amplitude of structure today and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ is the matter density parameter. Combining SPT-3G 2018 lensing measurements with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, we derive parameter constraints of $\sigma_8 = 0.810 \pm 0.033$, $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}= 0.836 \pm 0.039$, and Hubble constant $H_0 =68.8^{+1.3}_{-1.6}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Using CMB anisotropy and lensing measurements from SPT-3G only, we provide independent constraints on the spatial curvature of $\Omega_{K} = 0.014^{+0.023}_{-0.026}$ (95% C.L.) and the dark energy density of $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.722^{+0.031}_{-0.026}$ (68% C.L.). When combining SPT-3G lensing data with SPT-3G CMB anisotropy and BAO data, we find an upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses of $\sum m_{\nu}&lt; 0.30$ eV (95% C.L.).</p>

<p>2023-08-22, <strong>Searching for neutrino-modulino oscillations at the Forward Physics Facility</strong>, Luis A. Anchordoqui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11476v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.11476v1</a></p>

<p>We make use of swampland conjectures to explore the phenomenology of neutrino-modulino mixing in regions of the parameter space that are within the sensitivity of experiments at the CERN’s Forward Physics Facility (FPF). We adopt the working assumption of Dirac mass terms which couple left- and right-handed neutrinos. We further assume that the 3 right-handed neutrinos are 0-modes of bulk 5-dimensional states in the dark dimension, a novel scenario which has a compact space with characteristic length-scale in the micron range that produces a natural suppression of the 4-dimensional Yukawa couplings, yielding naturally light Dirac neutrinos. We formulate a specific realization of models with high-scale supersymmetry breaking that can host a rather heavy gravitino ($m_{3/2} \sim 250$ TeV) and a modulino with mass scale ($m_4 \sim 50$ eV) within the FPF discovery reach.</p>

<p>2023-08-22, <strong>The cosipy library: COSI’s high-level analysis software</strong>, Israel Martinez-Castellanos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11436v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.11436v1</a></p>

<p>The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a selected Small Explorer (SMEX) mission launching in 2027. It consists of a large field-of-view Compton telescope that will probe with increased sensitivity the under-explored MeV gamma-ray sky (0.2-5 MeV). We will present the current status of cosipy, a Python library that will perform spectral and polarization fits, image deconvolution, and all high-level analysis tasks required by COSI’s broad science goals: uncovering the origin of the Galactic positrons, mapping the sites of Galactic nucleosynthesis, improving our models of the jet and emission mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and detecting and localizing gravitational wave and neutrino sources. The cosipy library builds on the experience gained during the COSI balloon campaigns and will bring the analysis of data in the Compton regime to a modern open-source likelihood-based code, capable of performing coherent joint fits with other instruments using the Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (3ML). In this contribution, we will also discuss our plans to receive feedback from the community by having yearly software releases accompanied by publicly-available data challenges.</p>

<p>2023-08-22, <strong>Searching for Charged Lepton Flavour Violation with Mu3e</strong>, Ann-Kathrin Perrevoort et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11403v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.11403v1</a></p>

<p>The observation of lepton flavour violation (LFV) in the charged lepton sector would be an unambiguous sign of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), and thus, it is the channel of choice for many BSM searches. LFV searches in muon decays in particular benefit from the fact that muons can be easily produced at high rates. There is a global effort to search for LFV at high-intensity muon sources to which the upcoming Mu3e experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) will contribute. The Mu3e Collaboration aims to perform a background-free search for the LFV decay $\mu^+\to e^+e^-e^+$ with an unprecedented sensitivity in the order of $10^{-15}$ in the first phase of operation and $10^{-16}$ in the final phase - an improvement over the preceding SINDRUM experiment by four orders of magnitude. The high muon stopping rates and low momenta of the decay electrons make high demands on momentum and time resolution and on the data acquisition. The innovative experimental concept is based on a tracking detector built from novel ultra-thin silicon pixel sensors and scintillating fibres and tiles as well as online event reconstruction and filtering in real time.</p>

<p>2023-08-22, <strong>Identification of time-correlated neutrino clusters in populations of astrophysical transient sources</strong>, Mathieu Lamoureux et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11313v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.11313v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of astrophysical neutrinos from transient sources can help to understand the origin of the neutrino diffuse flux and to constrain the underlying production mechanisms. In particular, proton-neutron collisions may produce GeV neutrinos. However, at these energies, neutrino data from large water Cherenkov telescopes, like KM3NeT and IceCube, are dominated by the well-known atmospheric neutrino flux. It is then necessary to identify a sub-dominant component due to an astrophysical emission based on time correlation across messengers. The contribution covers several methods to search for such a signal in short time windows centered on observed transient sources, including a novel approach based on the distribution of time differences. Their performance is compared in the context of subpopulations of astrophysical sources that may show prompt or delayed neutrino emissions. The outlook for the usage of such techniques in actual analyses is also presented.</p>

<p>2023-08-22, <strong>Nuclear $β$ spectrum from projected shell model (I): allowed one-to-one transition</strong>, Fan Gao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11299v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.11299v1</a></p>

<p>Nuclear $\beta$ spectrum and the corresponding (anti-)neutrino spectrum play important roles in many aspects of nuclear astrophysics, particle physics, nuclear industry and nuclear data. In this work we propose a projected shell model (PSM) to calculate the level energies as well as the reduced one-body transition density (ROBTD) by the Pfaffian algorithm for nuclear $\beta$ decays. The calculated level energies and ROBTD are inputed to the Beta Spectrum Generator (BSG) code to study the high precision $\beta$ spectrum of allowed one-to-one transitions. When experimental level energies are adopted, the calculated $\beta$ spectrum by ROBTD of the PSM deviates from the one by the extreme simple particle evaluation of the BSG by up to $10\%$, reflecting the importance of nuclear many-body correlations. When calculated level energies are adopted, the calculated $\beta$ spectrum shows sensitive dependence on the reliability of calculated level energies. The developed method for ROBTD by the PSM will also be useful for study of the first-forbidden transitions, the isovector spin monopole resonance etc. in a straightforward way.</p>

<p>2023-08-21, <strong>Warm Compressor system Overview and status of the PIP-II cryogenic system</strong>, A Martinez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11045v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.11045v1</a></p>

<p>The Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) is a major upgrade to the Fermilab accelerator complex, featuring a new 800-MeV Superconducting Radio-Frequency (SRF) linear accelerator (Linac) powering the accelerator complex to provide the world’s most intense high-energy neutrino beam. The PIP-II Linac consists of 23 SRF cryomodules operating at 2 K, 5 K, and 40 K temperature levels supplied by a single helium cryoplant providing 2.5 kW of cooling capacity at 2.0 K. The PIP-II cryogenic system consists of two major systems: a helium cryogenic plant and a cryogenic distribution system. The cryogenic plant includes a refrigerator cold box, a warm compressor system, and helium storage, recovery, and purification systems. The cryogenic distribution system includes a distribution box, intermediate transfer line, and a tunnel transfer line consisting of modular bayonet cans which supply and return cryogens to the cryomodules. A turnaround can is located at the end of the Linac to turnaround cryogenic flows. This paper describes the layout, design, and current status of the PIP-II cryogenic system.</p>

<p>2023-08-21, <strong>Installation, commissioning, and testing of the HB650 CM at PIP2IT</strong>, M White et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11036v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.11036v1</a></p>

<p>The Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) is a major upgrade to the Fermilab accelerator complex, featuring a new 800-MeV Superconducting Radio-Frequency (SRF) linear accelerator (LINAC) powering the accelerator complex to provide the world’s most intense high-energy neutrino beam. This paper describes the conversion of the PIP-II Injector Test Facility (PIP2IT) cryogenic system into a test stand for PIP-II High-Beta 650 MHz (HB650) cryomodules at Fermilab’s Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF). A description of the associated mechanical, electrical, and controls modifications necessary for testing HB650 cryomodules are provided. The cooldown and warmup requirements, procedures and associated controls logic is described.</p>

<p>2023-08-21, <strong>Textures of Neutrino Mass Matrix from $S_4$-flavor Symmetry</strong>, N. Chamoun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10985v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.10985v1</a></p>

<p>We study a texture of neutrino mass matrix characterized by two constraints consisting of one equality and another antiequality between two elements corresponding to two pairs of the matrix entries. Amidst such textures, we limit our study to three patterns which were realizable assuming an $S_4$-symmetry within type II-seesaw scenario. Three such cases were found and studied: I ($M_{\nu 22}=-M_{\nu 33}$ \&amp; $M_{\nu 11}=+M_{\nu 23}$), II ($M_{\nu 11}=-M_{\nu 33}$ \&amp; $M_{\nu 22}=+M_{\nu 13}$) and III ($M_{\nu 11}=-M_{\nu 22}$ \&amp; $M_{\nu 33}=+M_{\nu 12}$). We specify the role of non-physical phases in the definition of the textures under study which were tested against experimental constraints, and were found to accommodate data with both hierarchies allowed. However, switching off the non-physical phases allows only for inverted hierarchy, except for the texture III which allows also, albeit for a very narrow parameter space region, for normal ordering. We present a complete phenomenological analysis of these three textures and justify analytically the resulting correlations. We detail the effect of the non-physical phases is diluting/deforming several correlations, which otherwise would have been ``clear”. Finally, we give theoretical realizations within seesaw type II scenarios for such textures.</p>

<p>2023-08-21, <strong>Effective interactions for the SM fermion mass hierarchy and their possible UV realization</strong>, A. E. Cárcamo Hernández et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10946v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.10946v1</a></p>

<p>We built an extended 2HDM theory with a spontaneously broken $U(1) _{X}$ global symmetry, where the tree level Universal Seesaw Mechanism generates the mass hierarchy of the Standard Model charged fermions and the Zee-Babu mechanism produces tiny active neutrino masses. The third family of SM charged fermions gets tree level masses from Yukawa interactions involving the Higgs doublets $H_1$ (for the top quark) and $H_2$ (for the bottom quark and tau lepton). The model under consideration is consistent with SM fermion masses and mixings, with the muon and electron $g-2$ anomalies and successfully accommodates the constraints arising from charged lepton flavor violation and meson oscillations. The proposed model predicts rates for charged lepton flavor violating decays within the reach of forthcoming experiments.</p>

<p>2023-08-21, <strong>The UHECR-FR0 Radio Galaxy Connection: A Multi-Messenger Study of Energy Spectra/Composition Emission and Intergalactic Magnetic Field Propagation</strong>, J. P. Lundquist et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10803v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.10803v1</a></p>

<p>This study investigates low luminosity Fanaroff-Riley Type 0 (FR0) radio galaxies as a potentially significant source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Due to their much higher prevalence in the local universe compared to more powerful radio galaxies (about five times more than FR-1s), FR0s may provide a substantial fraction of the total UHECR energy density. To determine the nucleon composition and energy spectrum of UHECRs emitted by FR0 sources, simulation results from CRPropa3 are fit to Pierre Auger Observatory data. The resulting emission spectral indices, rigidity cutoffs, and nucleon fractions are compared to recent Auger results. The FR0 simulations include the approximately isotropic distribution of FR0 galaxies and various intergalactic magnetic field configurations (including random and structured fields) and predict the fluxes of secondary photons and neutrinos produced during UHECR propagation through cosmic photon backgrounds. This comprehensive simulation allows for investigating the properties of the FR0 sources using observational multi-messenger data.</p>

<p>2023-08-21, <strong>Study of Scalar Non Standard Interaction at Protvino to Super-ORCA experiment</strong>, Dinesh Kumar Singha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10789v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.10789v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper we have studied the phenomenon of non-standard interaction mediated by a scalar field (SNSI) in the context of P2SO experiment and compared its sensitivity with DUNE. In particular, we have studied the capability of these two experiments to put bounds on the diagonal SNSI parameters i.e., $\eta_{ee}$, $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$ and studied the impact of these parameters on the determination of neutrino mass ordering, octant of $\theta_{23}$ and CP violation (CPV). In our analysis we find that, the parameter $\Delta m^2_{31}$ has a non-trivial role if one wants estimate the bounds on $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$ assuming SNSI does not exist in nature. Our results show that sensitivity of P2SO and DUNE to constraint $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$ are similar whereas the sensitivity of DUNE is slightly better for $\eta_{ee}$. We find that the mass ordering and CPV sensitivities are mostly affected by $\eta_{ee}$ compared to $\eta_{\mu \mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau \tau}$ if one assumes SNSI exists in nature. On the other hand, octant sensitivity is mostly affected by $\eta_{\mu \mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau \tau}$. These sensitivities can be either higher or lower than the standard three flavour scenario depending on the relative sign of the SNSI parameters. Regarding the precision of atmospheric mixing parameters, we find that the precision of $\theta_{23}$ deteriorates significantly in the presence of $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$.</p>

<p>2023-08-22, <strong>Tidal properties of neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity</strong>, Gastón Creci et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11323v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.11323v1</a></p>

<p>A major science goal of gravitational-wave (GW) observations is to probe the nature of gravity and constrain modifications to General Relativity. An established class of modified gravity theories are scalar-tensor models, which introduce an extra scalar degree of freedom. This affects the internal structure of neutron stars (NSs), as well as their dynamics and GWs in binary systems, where distinct novel features can arise from the appearance of scalar condensates in parts of the parameter space. To improve the robustness of the analyses of such GW events requires advances in modeling internal-structure-dependent phenomena in scalar-tensor theories. We develop an effective description of potentially scalarized NSs on large scales, where information about the interior is encoded in characteristic Love numbers or equivalently tidal deformabilities. We demonstrate that three independent tidal deformabilities are needed to characterize the configurations: a scalar, tensor, and a novel ‘mixed’ parameter, and develop the general methodology to compute these quantities. We also present case studies for different NS equations of state and scalar properties and provide the mapping between the deformabilities in different frames often used for calculations. Our results have direct applications for future GW tests of gravity and studies of potential degeneracies with other uncertain physics such as the equation of state or presence of dark matter in NS binary systems.</p>

<p>2023-08-22, <strong>WKB approximation to boson dark matter</strong>, Lauren Street et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11094v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.11094v1</a></p>

<p>Galactic dark matter halos may be composed of ultralight axions (ULAs) ($m_a \lesssim 1$ eV) with wave functions that satisfy nonlinear Schr"{o}dinger-Poisson equations (SPA). We find eigenstates of SPA in WKB approximation. The expansion parameter of the WKB approximation is $\delta=1/\sqrt{S}$, where $S=2 M R G m_a^{2}$, with $M$ being the total mass, $R$ the radius of the halo, and $G$ the gravitational constant. $S\gg 1$ for almost all galaxies, even if the ULA mass is as small as $m_a=10^{-22} $ eV, making the leading order WKB approximation almost exact. As the level spacing of bound states is roughly proportional to $\delta$, the number of states in the gravitational well is huge. We do not see a reason why not all or most of them contribute to the halo. Using an appropriate distribution function allows the summation of states to construct the profile of the halo as a function of the gravitational potential, which can be found solving the Poisson equation. Using various energy distribution functions, we obtain results similar to those in simulations. Future plans include investigations of collapse through time dependent generalizations, and inclusion of self-interactions, which also induce decay processes of the halo.</p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are known as one of the potential candidates for dark matter. They are expected to have formed due to the direct gravitational collapse of density fluctuations in the early Universe. Therefore, the study of the merger rate of PBHs in modified theories of gravity can provide more detailed information about their abundance. In this work, we delve into the calculation of the merger rate of PBHs within the theoretical framework of $f(R)$ gravity. Our analysis reveals an enhancement in the merger rate of PBHs compared to that obtained from general relativity (GR). Additionally, modulating the field strength $f_{R0}$ induces shifts in the PBH merger rate, presenting a potential observational signature of modified gravity. We also find that the total merger rate of PBHs will be consistent with the merger rate of black holes estimated by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo-KAGRA detectors if $f_{PBH}\gtrsim 0.1$. While further improvements might be required, relative enhancement of the merger rate of PBHs in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity and its consistency with gravitational wave data underscore the importance of employing modified theories of gravity to examine diverse scenarios related to the formation of black holes.</p>

<p>One of the challenges related to stellar bars is to determine accurately the length of the bar in a disc galaxy. In past literature, a wide variety of methods has been employed to measure the extent of a bar. However, a systematic study on determining the robustness and accuracy of different bar length estimators is still beyond our grasp. Here, we investigate the accuracy and the correlation (if any) between different bar length measurement methods while using an $N$-body model of a barred galaxy where the bar evolves self-consistently in presence of a live dark matter halo. We investigate the temporal evolution of the bar length, using different estimators (involving isophotal analysis of de-projected surface brightness distribution and Fourier decomposition of surface density), and study their robustness and accuracy. Further attempts have been made towards determining correlation between any two of these bar length estimators used here. In presence of spirals, the bar length estimators which only consider the amplitudes of different Fourier moments (and do not take into account the phase-angle of $m=2$ Fourier moment), systematically overestimate the length of the bar. The strength dark-gaps (produced by bars) correlates strongly with the bar length in early rapid growth phase, and is only weakly anti-correlated during subsequent quiescent phase of bar evolution. However, the location of dark-gaps correlates only weakly with the bar length, hence can not be used as a robust proxy for determining the bar length. In addition, the bar length estimators, obtained using isophotal analysis of de-projected surface brightness distribution, systematically overestimate the bar length. The implications of bar length over(under)estimation in the context of determining fast/slow bars are further discussed.</p>

<p>2023-08-21, <strong>COSMOS-Web: Intrinsically Luminous z$\gtrsim$10 Galaxy Candidates Test Early Stellar Mass Assembly</strong>, Caitlin M. Casey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10932v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.10932v1</a></p>

<p>We report the discovery of 15 exceptionally luminous $10\lesssim z\lesssim14$ candidate galaxies discovered in the first 0.28 deg$^2$ of JWST/NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web Survey. These sources span rest-frame UV magnitudes of $-20.5&gt;M_{\rm UV}&gt;-22$, and thus constitute the most intrinsically luminous $z\gtrsim10$ candidates identified by JWST to-date. Selected via NIRCam imaging with Hubble ACS/F814W, deep ground-based observations corroborate their detection and help significantly constrain their photometric redshifts. We analyze their spectral energy distributions using multiple open-source codes and evaluate the probability of low-redshift solutions; we conclude that 12/15 (80%) are likely genuine $z\gtrsim10$ sources and 3/15 (20%) likely low-redshift contaminants. Three of our $z\sim12$ candidates push the limits of early stellar mass assembly: they have estimated stellar masses $\sim5\times10^{9}\,M_\odot$, implying an effective stellar baryon fraction of $\epsilon_{\star}\sim0.2-0.5$, where $\epsilon_{\star}\equiv M_{\star}/(f_{b}M_{halo})$. The assembly of such stellar reservoirs is made possible due to rapid, burst-driven star formation on timescales $&lt;$100\,Myr where the star-formation rate may far outpace the growth of the underlying dark matter halos. This is supported by the similar volume densities inferred for $M_\star\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$ galaxies relative to $M_\star\sim10^{9}\,M_\odot$ – both about $10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ – implying they live in halos of comparable mass. At such high redshifts, the duty cycle for starbursts would be of order unity, which could cause the observed change in the shape of the UVLF from a double powerlaw to Schechter at $z\approx8$. Spectroscopic redshift confirmation and ensuing constraints of their masses will be critical to understanding how, and if, such early massive galaxies push the limits of galaxy formation in $\Lambda$CDM.</p>

<p>2023-08-21, <strong>Curl up with a good $\mathbf B$: Detecting ultralight dark matter with differential magnetometry</strong>, Itay M. Bloch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10931v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.10931v1</a></p>

<p>Ultralight dark matter (such as kinetically mixed dark-photon dark matter or axionlike dark matter) can source an oscillating magnetic-field signal at the Earth’s surface, which can be measured by a synchronized array of ground-based magnetometers. The global signal of ultralight dark matter can be robustly predicted for low masses, when the wavelength of the dark matter is larger than the radius of the Earth, $\lambda_\mathrm{DM}\gg R$. However, at higher masses, environmental effects, such as the Schumann resonances, can become relevant, making the global magnetic-field signal $\mathbf B$ difficult to reliably model. In this work, we show that $\nabla\times\mathbf B$ is robust to global environmental details, and instead only depends on the local dark matter amplitude. We therefore propose to measure the local curl of the magnetic field at the Earth’s surface, as a means for detecting ultralight dark matter with $\lambda_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim R$. As this measurement requires vertical gradients, it can be done near a hill/mountain. Our measurement scheme not only allows for a robust prediction, but also acts as a background rejection scheme for external noise sources. We show that our technique can be the most sensitive terrestrial probe of dark-photon dark matter for frequencies $10\,\mathrm{Hz}\leq f_{A’}\leq1\,\mathrm{kHz}$ (corresponding to masses $4\times10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}\leq m_{A’}\leq4\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$). It can also achieve sensitivities to axionlike dark matter comparabe to the CAST helioscope, in the same frequency range.</p>

<p>A larger Planck scale during an early epoch leads to a smaller Hubble rate, which is the measure for efficiency of primordial processes. The resulting slower cosmic tempo can accommodate alternative cosmological histories. We consider this possibility in the context of extra dimensional theories, which can provide a natural setting for the scenario. If the fundamental scale of the theory is not too far above the weak scale, to alleviate the ``hierarchy problem,” cosmological constraints imply that thermal relic dark matter would be at the GeV scale, which may be disfavored by cosmic microwave background measurements. Such dark matter becomes viable again in our proposal, due to smaller requisite annihilation cross section, further motivating ongoing low energy accelerator-based searches. Quantum gravity signatures associated with the extra dimensional setting can be probed at high energy colliders – up to $\sim 13$ TeV at the LHC or $\sim 100$ TeV at FCC-hh. Searches for missing energy signals of dark sector states, with masses $\gtrsim 10$ GeV, can be pursued at a future circular lepton collider.</p>

<p>A major question in $\Lambda$CDM is what this theory actually predicts for the properties of subhalo populations. Subhalos are difficult to simulate and to find within simulations, and this propagates into uncertainty in theoretical predictions for satellite galaxies. We present Symfind, a new particle-tracking-based subhalo finder, and demonstrate that it can track subhalos to orders-of-magnitude lower masses than commonly used halo-finding tools, with a focus on Rockstar and consistent-trees. These longer survival mean that at a fixed peak subhalo mass, we find $\approx 15\%{-}40\%$ more subhalos within the virial radius, $R_\textrm{vir}$, and $\approx 35\%-120\%$ more subhalos within $R_\textrm{vir}/4$ in the Symphony dark-matter-only simulation suite. More subhalos are found as resolution is increased. We perform extensive numerical testing. In agreement with idealized simulations, we show that the $v_{\rm max}$ of subhalos is only resolved at high resolutions ($n_\textrm{peak}\gtrsim3\times 10^4$), but that mass loss itself can be resolved at much more modest particle counts ($n_\textrm{peak}\gtrsim4\times 10^3$). We show that Rockstar converges to false solutions for the mass function, radial distribution, and disruption masses of subhalos. We argue that our new method can trace resolved subhalos until the point of typical galaxy disruption without invoking ``orphan’’ modeling. We outline a concrete set of steps for determining whether other subhalo finders meet the same criteria. We publicly release Symfind catalogs and particle data for the Symphony simulation suite at \url{http://web.stanford.edu/group/gfc/symphony}.</p>

<p>2023-08-21, <strong>From RATs to riches: mitigating anthropogenic and synanthropic noise in atom interferometer searches for ultra-light dark matter</strong>, John Carlton et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10731v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.10731v1</a></p>

<p>Atom interferometers offer promising new avenues for detecting ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). The exceptional sensitivity of atom interferometers to fluctuations in the local gravitational potential exposes them to sources of noise from human (anthropogenic) and animal (synanthropic) activity, which may obscure signals from ULDM. We characterise potential anthropogenic and synanthropic noise sources and examine their influence on a year-long measurement campaign by AION-10, an upcoming atom interferometer experiment that will be located at the University of Oxford. We propose a data cleaning framework that identifies and then masks anthropogenic and synanthropic noise. With this framework, we demonstrate that even in noisy conditions, the sensitivity to ULDM can be restored to within between 10% and 40% of an atom shot noise-limited experiment, depending on the specific composition of the anthropogenic and synanthropic noise. This work provides an important step towards creating robust noise reduction analysis strategies in the pursuit of ULDM detection with atom interferometers.</p>

<p>2023-08-21, <strong>Logarithmic divergent friction on ultrarelativistic bubble walls</strong>, Wen-Yuan Ai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10679v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.10679v1</a></p>

<p>We calculate the friction experienced by ultrarelativistic bubble walls resulting from the $1 \rightarrow 2$ light-to-heavy transition process, with finite-wall-width effects fully taken into account. In this process, the light particle is excited from the order-parameter scalar field, while the two heavy particles are excitations of a dark matter scalar field. Unlike earlier estimates suggesting a friction scaling as $\gamma_w^0$, where $\gamma_w$ represents the Lorentz factor of the wall velocity, our more precise numerical analysis reveals a logarithmic dependence of the friction on $\gamma_w$. We offer a numerical fit to capture this frictional pressure accurately. Our analysis verifies that the friction stemming from the $1 \rightarrow 2$ light-to-heavy transition is typically much smaller than the friction from the $1 \rightarrow 1$ transmission of the dark matter particles.</p>

<p>We report on several new results using anisotropies of UHECRs. We improve and extend the work of Ding, Globus and Farrar, who modeled the UHECR dipole assuming sources follow the dark matter distribution, accounting for deflections in the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields but using a simplified treatment of interactions during propagation. The work presented here employs an accurate and self-consistent treatment of the evolution of composition during propagation, allows for and explores the impact of “bias” in the relation between UHECR sources and the dark matter distribution, and investigates the possible generation of arrival-direction-dependent composition anisotropies. Limits on the source number density consistent with the observed anisotropies are derived for the case where UHECR sources follow the dark matter distribution, and compared to a homogeneous source distribution case.</p>

<p>Topological invariants have played a fundamental role in the advancement of theoretical high energy physics. Physicists have used several kinematic techniques to distinguish new physics predictions from the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics at Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, the study of global topological invariants of the collider signals has not yet attracted much attention. In this article, we present, a novel approach to study collider signals using persistent homology. The global topological properties of the ensemble of events as expressed by measures like persistent entropy, Betti area, etc. are worth considering in addition to the traditional approach of using kinematic variables event by event. In this exploratory study, we first explore the characteristic topological signature of a few SM electroweak resonant productions. Next, we use the framework to distinguish global properties of the invisible Higgs decay processes in the SM and a real singlet extension of the SM featuring stable singlet scalar dark matter.</p>

<p>The specific angular momenta ($j_t$) of stars, baryons as a whole and dark matter haloes contain clues of vital importance about how galaxies form and evolve. Using a sample of 70 spiral galaxies, we perform a preliminary analysis of $j_t$, and introduce a new quantity, e.g., areal density of angular momentum (ADAM) ($j_t~M_\star/4R_d^2$) as an indication for the existence of jet in spiral galaxies. The percentage of spiral galaxies having jet(s) shows strong correlation with the ADAM, although the present sample is incomplete.</p>

<p>The postulate of universal Weyl conformal symmetry for all elementary physical fields introduces nonclassical gravitational effects in both conformal gravitation(CG) and the conformal Higgs model (CHM). The resulting theory is found to explain major observed phenomena including excessive galactic rotation velocities and accelerating Hubble expansion, without invoking dark matter (DM). The recent history of this development is surveyed here. Implications of the theory include galactic baryonic Tully-Fisher relations and dark galactic haloes of definite large radius. Cosmological CHM parameters exclude a massive Higgs boson but are consistent with a novel alternative particle of the observed mass.</p>

<p>SNRs are likely to be significant sources of Galactic cosmic rays up to the knee. They produce gamma rays in the very-high-energy (E&gt;100 GeV) range mainly via two mechanisms: hadronic interactions of accelerated protons with the interstellar medium and leptonic interactions of accelerated electrons with soft photons. Observations with current instruments have lead to the detection of about a dozen SNRs in VHE gamma rays and future instruments will help significantly increase this number. Yet, the details of particle acceleration at SNRs, and of the mechanisms producing VHE gamma-ray at SNRs remain poorly understood: What is the spectrum of accelerated particles? What is the efficiency of particle acceleration? Is the gamma-ray emission dominated by hadronic or leptonic origin?   To address these questions, we simulate the population of SNRs in the gamma-ray domain, and confront it to the current population of TeV SNRs. This method allows us to investigate several crucial aspects of particle acceleration at SNRs, such as the level of magnetic field around SNR shocks or scanning the parameter space of the accelerated particles (spectral index, electron to proton ratio and the acceleration efficiency of the shock) with the possibility to constrain some of the parameters.</p>

<p>We review the local determination of the Hubble constant, H$_0$, focusing on recent measurements of a distance ladder constructed from geometry, Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We explain in some detail the components of the ladder: (1) geometry from Milky Way parallaxes, masers in NGC 4258 and detached eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud; (2) measurements of Cepheids with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in these anchors and in the hosts of 42 SNe Ia; and (3) SNe Ia in the Hubble flow. Great attention to negating systematic uncertainties through the use of differential measurements is reviewed. A wide array of tests are discussed. The measurements provide a strong indication of a discrepancy between the local measure of H$_0$ and its value predicted by $\Lambda$CDM theory, calibrated by the cosmic microwave background ($Planck$), a decade-long challenge known as the `Hubble Tension’. We present new measurements with the James Webb Space Telescope of $&gt;$320 Cepheids on both rungs of the distance ladder, in a SN Ia host and the geometric calibrator NGC 4258, showing reduced noise and good agreement with the same as measured with HST. This provides strong evidence that systematic errors in HST Cepheid photometry do not play a significant role in the present Hubble Tension. Future measurements are expected to refine the local determination of the Hubble constant.</p>

<p>We present the updated open-source code Complete History of Interaction-Powered Supernovae (CHIPS) that can be applied to modeling supernovae (SNe) arising from an interaction with massive circumstellar medium (CSM) as well as the formation process of the CSM. Our update mainly concerns with extensions to hydrogen-poor SNe from stripped progenitors, targeting modeling of interaction-powered SNe Ibc such as Type Ibn and Icn SNe. We successfully reproduce the basic properties of the light curves of these types of SNe that occur after partial eruption of the outermost layer with a mass of $0.01$–$0.1\,M_\odot$ at $\lesssim 1$ year before explosion. We also find that the luminosity of the observed precursors can be naturally explained by the outburst that creates the dense CSM, given that the energy of the outburst is efficiently dissipated by collision with an external material, possibly generated by a previous mass eruption. We discuss possible scenarios causing eruptive mass-loss based on our results.</p>

<p>2023-08-21, <strong>Evolution of double oxygen-neon white dwarf merger remnant</strong>, Chengyuan Wu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10695v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.10695v1</a></p>

<p>Double white dwarf (WD) merger process and their post-merger evolution are important in many fields of astronomy, such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, gravitational waves, etc. The evolutionary outcomes of double ultra-massive WD merger remnants are still a subject of debate, though the general consensus is that the merger remnant will collapse to form a neutron star. In this work, we investigate the evolution of a 2.20Msun merger remnant stemmed from the coalescence of double 1.10Msun ONe WDs. We find that the remnant ignites off-centre neon burning at the position near the surface of primary WD soon after the merger, resulting in the stable inwardly propagating oxygen/neon (O/Ne) flame. The final outcomes of the merger remnant are sensitive to the effect of convective boundary mixing. If the mixing cannot stall the O/Ne flame, the flame will reach the centre within 20 years, leading to the formation of super Chandrasekhar mass silicon core, and its final fate probably be neutron star (NS) through iron-core-collapse supernova. In contrast, if the convective mixing is effective enough to prevent the O/Ne flame from reaching the centre, the merger remnant will undergo electron capture supernova to form an ONeFe WD. Meanwhile, we find that the wind mass loss process may hardly alter the final fate of the remnant due to its fast evolution. Our results imply that the coalescence of double ONe WDs can form short lived giant like object, but the final outcomes (NS or ONeFe WD) are influenced by the uncertain convective mixing in O/Ne flame.</p>
