<p>2023-11-28, <strong>A discussion of the cross section $\barν_e+p\to e^+ + n$</strong>, Giulia Ricciardi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16730v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16730v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the interaction cross section $\bar\nu_e-p$ due to charged currents, of major importance for neutrino detection. We present the history of its understanding and highlight the aspects necessary for its precise evaluation. We examine the three most recent determinations and, on the basis of the most recent one, tabulate its updated values and assess its uncertainty.</p>

<p>2023-11-28, <strong>Second leptogenesis: Unraveling the baryon-lepton asymmetry discrepancy</strong>, YeolLin ChoeJo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16672v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16672v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a novel scenario to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry by twofold leptogenesis, wherein heavy Majorana neutrinos exhibit temperature-dependent masses and engage in $CP$-violating decays. This scenario envisages two distinct phases of leptogenesis: one occurring above the electroweak scale and the other below it. The sphaleron process converts the first lepton asymmetry to baryon asymmetry, but not the second one due to its decoupling. This mechanism potentially explains the significant discrepancy between baryon and lepton asymmetries, as suggested by recent observations of Helium-4. Furthermore, our model implies that the present masses of Majorana neutrinos are lighter than the electroweak scale, offering a tangible avenue for experimental verification in various terrestrial settings.</p>

<p>2023-11-28, <strong>Pulse shape discrimination technique for diffuse supernova neutrino background search with JUNO</strong>, Jie Cheng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16550v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16550v1</a></p>

<p>Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) is widely used in liquid scintillator (LS) detectors and enables the classification of different particle types based on their energy deposition patterns. PSD is particularly valuable in the studies of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), nucleon decay, and dark matter searches. This paper presents a detailed investigation of the PSD technique, applied in the DSNB search performed with the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). Instead of using conventional cut-and-count methods, we employ methods based on Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) and Neural Networks (NN) and compare their capability to distinguish the DSNB signals from the atmospheric neutrino neutral-current (NC) background events. The two methods demonstrate comparable performance, resulting in a 50% to 80% improvement in signal efficiency compared to a previous study performed for JUNO. Moreover, we study the dependence of the PSD performance on the visible energy and final state composition of the events and find a significant dependence on the presence/absence of $^{11}$C. Finally, we evaluate the impact of the detector effects (photon propagation, PMT dark noise, and waveform reconstruction) on the PSD performance.</p>

<p>2023-11-28, <strong>Constraining Neutrino Cosmologies with Nonlinear Reconstruction</strong>, Shi-Hui Zang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16439v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16439v1</a></p>

<p>Nonlinear gravitational evolution induces strong nonlinearities in the observed cosmological density fields, leading to positive off-diagonal correlations in the power spectrum covariance. This has caused the information saturation in the power spectrum, e.g., the neutrino mass constraints from the nonlinear power spectra are lower than their linear counterparts by a factor of $\sim2$ at $z=0$. In this paper, we explore how nonlinear reconstruction methods improve the cosmological information from nonlinear cosmic fields. By applying nonlinear reconstruction to cold dark matter fields from the Quijote simulations, we find that nonlinear reconstruction can improve the constraints on cosmological parameters significantly, nearly reaching the linear theory limit. For neutrino mass, the result is only $12\%$ lower than the linear power spectrum, i.e., the theoretical best result. This makes nonlinear reconstruction an efficient and useful method to extract neutrino information from current and upcoming galaxy surveys.</p>

<p>2023-11-28, <strong>Going Big for Phase III of the Project 8 Neutrino Mass Experiment</strong>, Juliana Stachurska et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16415v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16415v1</a></p>

<p>Project 8 is a next generation experiment aiming to directly measure the neutrino mass using the tritium endpoint method with a targeted sensitivity of 40 meV. Having established a new measuring technique, Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), the next development phase will demonstrate CRES on a large source volume, culminating in a pilot-scale CRES experiment with atomic tritium. A promising option is a mode-filtered, cylindrical, resonant cavity in which cyclotron radiation from magnetically trapped beta electrons only couples to the lowest eigenmode, maximizing effective volume and minimizing signal complexity. Recent progress in the experiment design, including a small scale cavity CRES proof-of-concept apparatus to demonstrate CRES in cavities and its scalability to large volumes are described.</p>

<p>2023-11-28, <strong>Stream Members Only: Data-Driven Characterization of Stellar Streams with Mixture Density Networks</strong>, Nathaniel Starkman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16960v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16960v1</a></p>

<p>Stellar streams are sensitive probes of the Milky Way’s gravitational potential. The mean track of a stream constrains global properties of the potential, while its fine-grained surface density constrains galactic substructure. A precise characterization of streams from potentially noisy data marks a crucial step in inferring galactic structure, including the dark matter, across orders of magnitude in mass scales. Here we present a new method for constructing a smooth probability density model of stellar streams using all of the available astrometric and photometric data. To characterize a stream’s morphology and kinematics, we utilize mixture density networks to represent its on-sky track, width, stellar number density, and kinematic distribution. We model the photometry for each stream as a single-stellar population, with a distance track that is simultaneously estimated from the stream’s inferred distance modulus (using photometry) and parallax distribution (using astrometry). We use normalizing flows to characterize the distribution of background stars. We apply the method to the stream GD-1, and the tidal tails of Palomar 5. For both streams we obtain a catalog of stellar membership probabilities that are made publicly available. Importantly, our model is capable of handling data with incomplete phase-space observations, making our method applicable to the growing census of Milky Way stellar streams. When applied to a population of streams, the resulting membership probabilities from our model form the required input to infer the Milky Way’s dark matter distribution from the scale of the stellar halo down to subhalos.</p>

<p>2023-11-28, <strong>Forecasting the BAO Measurements of the CSST galaxy and AGN Spectroscopic Surveys</strong>, Haitao Miao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16903v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16903v1</a></p>

<p>The spectroscopic survey of the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is expected to obtain a huge number of slitless spectra, including more than one hundred million galaxy spectra and millions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) spectra. By making use of these spectra, we can measure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals over large redshift ranges with excellent precisions. In this work, we predict the CSST measurements of the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectra at 0&lt;z&lt;1.2 and pre-reconstruction AGN power spectra at 0&lt;z&lt;4, and derive the BAO signals at different redshift bins by constraining the BAO scaling parameters using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Our result shows that the CSST spectroscopic survey can provide accurate BAO measurements with precisions higher than 1% and 3% for the galaxy and AGN surveys, respectively. By comparing with current measurements in the same range at low redshifts, this can improve the precisions by a factor of $2\sim3$, and similar precisions can be obtained in the pessimistic case. We also investigate the constraints on the cosmological parameters using the measured BAO data by the CSST, and obtain stringent constraint results for the energy density of dark matter, Hubble constant, and equation of state of dark energy.</p>

<p>2023-11-28, <strong>Testing Weyl geometric gravity with the SPARC galactic rotation curves database</strong>, Maria Crăciun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16893v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16893v1</a></p>

<p>We present a detailed investigation of the properties of the galactic rotation curves in the Weyl geometric gravity model, in which the gravitational action is constructed from the square of the Weyl curvature scalar, and of the strength of the Weyl vector. The theory admits a scalar-vector tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component, an exact solution of the field equations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants, and, as compared to the Schwarzschild solution, contains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate. In the framework of this solution we obtain the exact general relativistic expression of the tangential velocity of the massive test particles moving in stable circular orbits in the galactic halo. We test the theoretical predictions of the model by using 175 galaxies from the Spitzer Photometry \&amp; Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database. We fit the theoretical predictions of the rotation curves in conformal gravity with the SPARC data by using the Multi Start and Global Search methods. In the total expression of the tangential velocity we also include the effects of the baryonic matter, and the mass to luminosity ratio. Our results indicate that the simple solution of the Weyl geometric gravity can successfully account for the large variety of the rotation curves of the SPARC sample, and provide a satisfactory description of the particle dynamics in the galactic halos, without the need of introducing the elusive dark matter particle.</p>

<p>2023-11-28, <strong>WIMP constraints from black hole low-mass X-ray binaries</strong>, Arpan Kar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16539v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16539v1</a></p>

<p>The abnormally fast orbital decay observed in the black hole (BH) Low-Mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXB) A0620-00 and XTE J1118+480 can be explained by the dynamical friction between Dark Matter (DM) and the companion star orbiting around the low-mass BH (of a few $M_\odot$) of the system. In this case the value of the index $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ of the DM spike surrounding the BH can be pinned down with an accuracy of a few percent, way better than that for much bigger systems such as the super massive BHs (SMBHs) in the Galactic Center or in M87. We have used the data from XTE J1118+480 to put bounds on the WIMP annihilation cross section times velocity $\langle \sigma v\rangle$, assuming that DM annihilation is driven by the $b\bar{b}$ channel and that it proceeds in $s$-wave. The bounds are driven by the radio synchrotron signal produced by $e^\pm$ final states propagating in the magnetic field near the BH. For DM masses $m_\chi$ up to the TeV scale XTE J1118+480 allows to constrain $\langle \sigma v\rangle$ well below $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm thermal}$, corresponding to the observed DM relic density in the Universe for a thermal WIMP. On the other hand, for $m_\chi \gtrsim$ 15 GeV the bounds from the SMBHs in the GC or in M87 do not reach $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm thermal}$ when the very large uncertainties on the corresponding spike indices are taken into account, in spite of potentially producing much larger DM densities compared to XTE J1118+480. Our bounds for XTE J1118+480 have a mild sensitivity on spatial diffusion, but diffusion enhances the sensitivity of the results upon the intensity of the magnetic field. Taken at face value the bound from XTE J1118+480 on $\langle \sigma v\rangle$ is the most constraining compared to all others for $m_\chi\lesssim$ 1 TeV, unless the intensity of the magnetic field is smaller than its equipartition estimation.</p>

<p>2023-11-28, <strong>Is Betelgeuse really rotating? Synthetic ALMA observations of large-scale convection in 3D simulations of Red Supergiants</strong>, Jing-Ze Ma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16885v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16885v1</a></p>

<p>The evolved stages of massive stars are poorly understood, but invaluable constraints can be derived from spatially resolved observations of nearby red supergiants, such as Betelgeuse. ALMA observations of Betelgeuse showing a dipolar velocity field have been interpreted as evidence for a rotation rate of $v\sin i \sim 5\, \mathrm{km\, s^{-1}}$. This is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by single-star evolution, leading to the suggestion that Betelgeuse is a binary merger product. We propose instead that the velocity field could be due to large-scale convective motions. The resulting surface velocity maps can sometimes be mistaken for rotation, especially when the turbulent motions are only partially resolved, as is the case for the current ALMA beam. We support this claim with 3D CO5BOLD simulations of non-rotating red supergiants post-processed to predict synthetic ALMA images and SiO spectra to compare with observed radial velocity maps. Our simulations show a $\sim 50\%$ chance to be interpreted as evidence for a rotation rate as high as claimed for Betelgeuse. We conclude that we need at least another ALMA observation to firmly establish whether Betelgeuse is indeed rapidly rotating. Such observations would also provide insight into the role of angular momentum and binary interaction in the late evolutionary stages. The data will further probe the structure and complex physical processes in the atmospheres of red supergiants, which are immediate progenitors of supernovae and are believed to be essential in the formation of gravitational wave sources.</p>

<p>2023-11-28, <strong>The Role of Type Ia Supernovae in Constraining the Hubble Constant</strong>, Daniel Scolnic et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16830v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16830v1</a></p>

<p>In the conventional / most studied local distance ladder measurements, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are used in two of the three rungs. In the second rung, their luminosities are calibrated by standard candles like Cepheids or Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB). In the third rung, the high luminosities and standardizability allow SNe to be used to calibrate the `Hubble’ relation between distances and redshifts. Locally, the majority of distance ladder analyses find a high value of the Hubble Constant $H_0$ of $&gt;70$ km/s/Mpc. Given the discrepancy with the inferred value using CMB observations, great scrutiny must be given to the role supernovae play in measuring $H_0$. Here, we review the main methodology, the many crosschecks for the supernova component of the distance ladder, and the various systematics studied. We review the important role supernovae play to explain the small disagreements seen from various local analyses. We also discuss analyses that employ an inverse distance ladder, which use similar sets of supernovae, but in the reverse direction, and yield a low value of $H_0$. We conclude given all available evidence, it is difficult to find a way that a systematic in supernovae measurements, or a non-$\Lambda$CDM component of the universe which could be measured with supernovae, can help explain the Hubble tension.</p>

<p>2023-11-28, <strong>Reconstruction of symmteric teleparallel gravity with energy conditions</strong>, Irfan Mahmood et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16527v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16527v1</a></p>

<p>This research investigates the impact of modified gravity on cosmic scales, focusing on $f(Q)$ cosmology. By applying energy conditions, the study reconstructs various $f(Q)$ models, considering an accelerating Universe, quintessence, and a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Using up-to-date observational data, including the Supernova Pantheon sample and cosmic chronometer data, Hubble constants $H_0$ are estimated as $70.37^{+0.84}_{-0.92}$ km/sec/Mpc (from $H(z)$ data) and $70.02^{+0.44}_{-0.25}$ km/sec/Mpc (from pantheon compilation of SN Ia data). The matter energy density parameter ($\Omega_{0m}$) is calculated as $0.26^{0.015}_{-0.010}$(OHD) and $0.27^{0.025}_{-0.014}$(SN Ia). Furthermore, as a function of redshift $z$, explicit expressions of $f(Q)$ and the EOS parameter $\omega$ are produced, and their graphical analysis describes the late time acceleration of the Universe without the usage of dark energy.</p>
