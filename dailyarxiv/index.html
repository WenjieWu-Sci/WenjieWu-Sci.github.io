<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Cross section for supernova axion observation in neutrino water Cherenkov detectors</strong>, Pierluca Carenza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17055v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.17055v1</a></p>

<p>Axions coupled to nucleons might be copiously emitted from core-collapse supernovae (SNe). If the axion-nucleon coupling is strong enough, axions would be emitted from the SN as a burst and, reaching Earth, may excite the oxygen nuclei in water Cherenkov detectors (${}^{16}{\rm O} + a \to {}^{16}{\rm O}^{<em>}$). This process will be followed by radiative decay(s) of the excited state (${}^{16}{\rm O}^</em> \rightarrow {}^{16}{\rm O}+\gamma $) providing a strategy for a direct detection of axions from a Galactic SN in large underground neutrino Cherenkov detectors. Motivated by this possibility, we present an updated calculation of axion-oxygen cross section obtained by using self-consistent continuum Random Phase Approximation. We calculate the branching ratio of the oxygen nucleus de-excitation into gamma-rays, neutrons, protons and $\alpha$-particles. These results are used to revisit the detectability of axions from SN 1987A in Kamiokande-II.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Astrophysical neutrino oscillations after pulsar timing array analyses</strong>, Gaetano Lambiase et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16977v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16977v1</a></p>

<p>The pattern of neutrino flavor oscillations could be altered by the influence of noisy perturbations such as those arising from a gravitational wave background (GWB). A stochastic process that is consistent with a GWB has been recently reported by the independent analyses of pulsar timing array (PTA) data sets collected over a decadal timescale by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) collaborations. We investigate the modifications in the neutrino flavor oscillations under the influence of the GWB reported by the PTA collaborations and we discuss how such effects could be potentially revealed in near-future neutrino detectors, possibly helping the discrimination of different models for the GWB below the nHz frequency range.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>LIME – a gas TPC prototype for directional Dark Matter search for the CYGNO experiment</strong>, Fernando Domingues Amaro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16856v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16856v1</a></p>

<p>The CYGNO experiment aims at the development of a large gaseous TPC with GEM-based amplification and an optical readout by means of PMTs and scientific CMOS cameras for 3D tracking down to O(keV) energies, for the directional detection of rare events such as low mass Dark Matter and solar neutrino interactions. The largest prototype built so far towards the realisation of the CYGNO experiment demonstrator is the 50 L active volume LIME, with 4 PMTs and a single sCMOS imaging a 33$\times$33 cm\textsuperscript{2} area for 50 cm drift, that has been installed in underground Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in February 2022. We will illustrate LIME performances as evaluated overground in Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati by means of radioactive X-ray sources, and in particular the detector stability, energy response and energy resolution. We will discuss the MC simulation developed to reproduce the detector response and show the comparison with actual data. We will furthermore examine the background simulation worked out for LIME underground data taking and illustrate the foreseen expected measurement and results in terms of natural and materials intrinsic radioactivity characterisation and measurement of the LNGS underground natural neutron flux. The results that will be obtained by underground LIME installation will be paramount in the optimisation of the CYGNO demonstrator, since this is foreseen to be composed by multiple modules with the same LIME dimensions and characteristics.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Neutrino flares of radio blazars observed from TeV to PeV</strong>, Alisa Suray et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16797v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16797v1</a></p>

<p>Radio blazars have been linked both to individual high-energy neutrino events and to excesses in likelihood sky maps constructed from lower-energy neutrino data. However, the exact mechanism by which neutrinos are produced in these sources is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that IceCube neutrinos with energies over 200 TeV, which were previously associated with bright radio blazars, are significantly more likely to be accompanied by flares of lower-energy events, compared to those lacking blazar counterparts. The parsec-scale core radio flux of blazars positioned within the error regions of energetic events is strongly correlated with the likelihood of a coincident day-scale lower-energy neutrino flare reported by IceCube. The probability of a chance correlation is 3.6*10^{-4}. This confirms the neutrino-blazar connection in a new and independent way, and provides valuable clues to understanding the origin of astrophysical neutrinos.</p>

<h1 id="dark-matter-9">dark matter (9)</h1>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Probing the Dark Matter density with gravitational waves from super-massive binary black holes</strong>, Anish Ghoshal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17158v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.17158v1</a></p>

<p>Supermassive black hole binaries source gravitational waves measured by Pulsar Timing Arrays. The frequency spectrum of this stochastic background is predicted more precisely than its amplitude. We argue that Dark Matter friction can suppress the spectrum around nHz frequencies, where it is measured, allowing to derive robust and significant bounds on the Dark Matter density, which, in turn, controls indirect detection signals from galactic centers. A precise spectrum of gravitational waves would translate in a tomography of the DM density profile, potentially probing DM particle-physics effects that induce a characteristic DM density profile, such as DM annihilations or de Broglie wavelength.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Dark Matter Spike surrounding Supermassive Black Holes Binary and the nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</strong>, Zhao-Qiang Shen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17143v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.17143v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, the NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA and CPTA collaborations reported compelling evidence of the existence of the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). The amplitude and spectrum of this inferred gravitational-wave background align closely with the astrophysical predictions for a signal originating from the population of supermassive black-hole binaries. In light of these findings, we explore the possibility to detect dark matter spikes surrounding massive black holes, which could potentially impact the gravitational-wave waveform and modulate the SGWB. We demonstrate that the SMBH binary evolution induced by the combined effects of GW radiation and the dynamical friction of the dark matter spike exhibits detectable manifestations within the nHz frequency range of the SGWB.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Self-Interacting Forbidden Dark Matter under a Cannibally Co-Decaying Phase</strong>, Kwei-Chou Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17037v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.17037v1</a></p>

<p>For the typical forbidden dark matter (DM), the correct relic density is determined exclusively by kinetically forbidden DM annihilations which vanish at zero temperature. We present a model that contains the DM and a heavier but unstable scalar mediator in the hidden sector. When the temperature drops below $\sim m_{\rm DM}$, this hidden sector, thermally decoupled from the visible sector, enters a cannibal phase (with zero chemical potential), during which the DM density is depleted with the out-of-equilibrium decay of the scalar mediator. As such, the freeze-out process, described by forbidden DM annihilations to mediators, evolves with a temperature different from the SM bath. The DM candidate of having a mass in the range of tens of MeV can result in the correct relic density and sizable 2-to-2 self-interactions, which fit small structure problems. The future sensitivity of the NA62 beam dump experiment can probe the parameter space of the related scalar mediator.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Gravitational Waves from SMBH Binaries in Light of the NANOGrav 15-Year Data</strong>, John Ellis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17021v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.17021v1</a></p>

<p>The NANOGrav Collaboration has recently announced evidence for nHz gravitational waves (GWs), in the form of a Hellings-Downs angular correlation in the common-spectrum process that had been observed previously by them and other Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). We analyze the possibility that these GWs originate from binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with total masses $\gtrsim 10^9\, M_{\odot}$. The spectral index of the GW signal differs at 95 % CL from that predicted for binary evolution by GW emission alone, and we find $&gt; 3 \sigma$ evidence that environmental effects such as dynamical friction with gas, stars, and dark matter may be affecting the binary evolution. We estimate the required magnitude and spectrum of such environmental effects and comment on their possible implications for measurements of GWs at higher frequencies.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Self-interacting dark matter implied by nano-Hertz gravitational waves</strong>, Chengcheng Han et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16966v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16966v1</a></p>

<p>The self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) paradigm provides a potential solution to the challenge faced by the cold dark matter model in explaining small-scale structure problems. This paradigm incorporates self-interactions among DM particles, typically mediated by a particle with a mass around MeV. The recent evidences of nano-Hertz gravitational waves from NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA, and CPTA collaborations indicate a first-order phase transition (FOPT) occurring at a temperature of the MeV scale. Considering the close proximity between these two scales, we postulate that the mediator mass in the SIDM model originates from the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)’$ symmetry, which is driven by the FOPT indicated by pulsar time array data. Consequently, the alignment of these two scales is believed to be deeply connected by the same underlying physics. Through a comprehensive survey of the parameter space, we identify the viable region favored by SIDM and simultaneously provide an explanation for the pulsar timing array data.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>The History of The Milky Way: The Evolution of Star Formation, Cosmic Rays, Metallicity, and Stellar Dynamics over Cosmic Time</strong>, Jiro Shimoda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16887v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16887v1</a></p>

<p>We study the long-term evolution of the Milky Way (MW) over cosmic time by modeling the star formation, cosmic rays, metallicity, stellar dynamics, outflows and inflows of the galactic system to obtain various insights into the galactic evolution. The mass accretion is modeled by the results of cosmological $N$-body simulations for the cold dark matter. We find that the star formation rate is about half the mass accretion rate of the disk, given the consistency between observed Galactic Diffuse X-ray Emissions (GDXEs) and possible conditions driving the Galactic wind. Our model simultaneously reproduces the quantities of star formation rate, cosmic rays, metals, and the rotation curve of the current MW. The most important predictions of the model are that there is an unidentified accretion flow with a possible number density of $\sim10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$ and the part of the GDXEs originates from a hot, diffuse plasma which is formed by consuming about 10 % of supernova explosion energy. The latter is the science case for future X-ray missions; XRISM, Athena, and so on. We also discuss further implications of our results for the planet formation and observations of externalgalaxies in terms of the multimessenger astronomy.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Cosmology in Minkowski space</strong>, Lucas Lombriser et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16868v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16868v1</a></p>

<p>Theoretical and observational challenges to standard cosmology such as the cosmological constant problem and tensions between cosmological model parameters inferred from different observations motivate the development and search of new physics. A less radical approach to venturing beyond the standard model is the simple mathematical reformulation of our theoretical frameworks underlying it. While leaving physical measurements unaffected, this can offer a reinterpretation and even solutions of these problems. In this spirit, metric transformations are performed here that cast our Universe into different geometries. Of particular interest thereby is the formulation of cosmology in Minkowski space. Rather than an expansion of space, spatial curvature, and small-scale inhomogeneities and anisotropies, this frame exhibits a variation of mass, length and time scales across spacetime. Alternatively, this may be interpreted as an evolution of fundamental constants. As applications of this reframed cosmological picture, the naturalness of the cosmological constant is reinspected and promising candidates of geometric origin are explored for dark matter, dark energy, inflation and baryogenesis. An immediate observation thereby is the apparent absence of the cosmological constant problem in the Minkowski frame. The formalism is also applied to identify new observable signatures of conformal inhomogeneities, which have been proposed as simultaneous solution of the observational tensions in the Hubble constant, the amplitude of matter fluctuations, and the gravitational lensing amplitude of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. These are found to enhance redshifts to distant galaxy clusters and introduce a mass bias with cluster masses inferred from gravitational lensing exceeding those inferred kinematically or dynamically.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Mirror QCD phase transition as the origin of the nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background detected by the Pulsar Timing Arrays</strong>, Lei Zu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16769v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16769v1</a></p>

<p>Recent independent announcements by several collaborations have shown strong evidence of a Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB) detected through Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). In this study, we investigate the implications of a first-order phase transition occurring within the early universe’s dark quantum chromodynamics (dQCD) epoch, specifically within the framework of the mirror twin Higgs dark sector model. Our analysis indicates a distinguishable SGWB signal originating from this phase transition, which can explain the measurements obtained by PTAs. Remarkably, a significant portion of the parameter space within the mirror twin Higgs model that accounts for the SGWB signal also effectively resolves the existing tensions in both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ measurements in Cosmology. This intriguing correlation suggests a possible common origin for these three phenomena. Furthermore, the parameter region, $0.2 &lt; \Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0.5$, where the mirror dark matter component constitutes less than $30\%$ of the total dark matter abundance, can accommodate all current cosmological observations and PTA measurements.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Holographic description of $F(R)$ gravity coupled with Axion Dark Matter</strong>, Simone D’Onofrio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16743v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16743v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we study the autonomous dynamical system of different $F(R)$ models in the formalism of holographic dark energy using the generalized Nojiri-Odintsov cut-off. We explicitly give the expression of the fixed points as functions of the infrared cut-off for vacuum $F(R)$ gravity in flat and non-flat FRW background and for $F(R)$ coupling axion dark matter. Each fixed point component can be taken as a condition on the cut-off and on the expression of $F(R)$, leading to physically interesting constraints on these functions.</p>
